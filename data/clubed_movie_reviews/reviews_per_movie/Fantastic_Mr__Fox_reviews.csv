A feast for the eyes and ears. No Roald Dahl in sight though,"After reading the reviews on here I wasn't put off watching this film. As a huge fan of animation, as well as Wes Anderson films this film definitely did everything and more for me. There's so much going on in every scene, I found it even funnier than other Anderson films, and as usual I loved all the characters. Anderson manages to keep all the coin facial expressions/awkward silences between characters/quirky background stories that appear in all his films. It's a true work of brilliance! This film has a 'kids film' label on it, but it's not really for children in my opinion, I urge anyone who appreciates animation and is looking to watch something quirky and intelligent to go for this film. Don't be put off due to the hordes of children. Anderson films are best watched on the big screen, so go see it now before it finishes at our cinemas.The only criticism I will say about this is that I don't think Anderson should have kept the original title of Roald Dahl's story 'Fantastic Mr Fox'. Mainly because it has been adapted so much to Anderson's style (as well as being Americanised) that it isn't really in keeping with Dahl's story, and fans of the acclaimed writer who want to experience the film adaptation of his story will be disappointed I feel. I think he should have given it a different title, like 'Foxxed' or something (that's a rubbish suggestion, but you get what I mean), as I loved it, and wouldn't change anything else, but marketing it as an adaptation of Dahl's book is a little mis-leading (definitely for British people anyway).-As a side point I think that as much as Dahl supplies a brilliant story and tons of material to make a very good film, I think Dahl's stories are best kept where they belong, and that is on paper. It is his literacy genius where the magic of his stories lie, and reading them (rather than looking at them) gives me the most enjoyment than I could ever get from watching a film of one of his stories.I left the cinema with a huge grin on my face and felt like bouncing along the pavement as I made my way home. It definitely has been the highlight of my week, and will be without a doubt one of the best films I've seen this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Nutshell Review: Fantastic Mr. Fox,"I'm pretty much the sucker for stop motion animation, so this naturally comes with that wee bit of bias, because I surely take my hats off to the filmmakers, especially the modelers and pretty much everyone who has to painstakingly move everything a little bit at a time, which for folks who are impatient (like myself), would already have driven one nuts.But this crazy effort in bringing to life Roald Dahl's story of a sly fox, is pretty much worth every frame of it. The man hours and intricate designs are something of an old school technique when compared to the latest computer wizardry, but you'll be amazed at what director Wes Anderson and his team managed to come up with, complete with a solid story, likable characters, and plenty of fun.George Clooney voices Mr Fox, a smug (what else, since Clooney chews these type of roles for breakfast) and wily erm, fox whose specialty is being the chicken thief that he is, providing for family. An incident cutting too close to death has Mr Fox promise Mrs Fox (Meryl Streep) that his thieving days are over, but you know how a leopard cannot change its spots. Soon he moves his family near three farmers Bean (Michael Gambon), Boggis (Robin Hurlstone) and Bunce (Hugo Guinness), and crafts his final hurrah in hitting all three neighbours, only for them to retaliate and demolish Mr Fox's lifestyle, and not to mention his relationship with wife, family and friends, resulting in a battle of wills and wits.Despite the relatively short run time, the film managed to pack plenty of subplots, characterization, and comedy into one well oiled narrative. You'll surely be one without a sense of humour should you not be able to laugh at anything and everything that Anderson had put on screen, from slapstick to really smart and funny lines that make up every moment of enjoyment in this film. The A-list voice cast also includes the likes of Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, Brian Cox, Adrien Brody et al, some of whom you'll know are regulars in Anderson's past works.And if you had enjoyed his past quirky films, then you'd come to expect the same for Fantastic Mr. Fox, with Wes Andersen's signature touches all over the shop, where he made some departures from Dahl's book, but manage to retain the essence of the story, and through a stroke of luck, finding an alternate ending from Dahl's original manuscript which got adopted here in the film. It's comical, it's smart, it's stop motion and it won't be too long before fans will soon adopt Mr Fox's trademarked whistle-whistle-click-click.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Holy Cuss, This Film Is Great","Giving up his life of a chicken thief because of a child on the way, Mr. Fox gets a job as a newspaper writer and lives underground. Years pass, his child is older and he wants to move to a tree and not feel poor anymore. Along the way he takes in his nephew and decides to steal again, from the three biggest farmers no less. The farmers get wise and start a battle against Mr. Fox, his family and all their creature friends.At first I didn't know if I wanted to see this, the animation looked really bad. But after thinking about it for a bit, I found that it fit into Anderson's style, it was something that he would do. So I gave the film a shot and I'm glad I did. This film has Anderson's signature style all over it, right down to the obvious voice casting, which has the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Michael Gambon, Owen Wilson, and Willem Dafoe.A lot of people, and I'm including myself in this bunch, might think nothing of this film. After all, it doesn't have the bright, adventurous feel of the recent Disney/Pixar films that have been dominating the animation scene. I'd even throw Dreamworks into that bunch. Those films are done by people who are at ease in their field, animated director like Brad Bird and John Lasseter know their way around the animation style. Yet here comes auteur Wes Anderson, who has a unique style and sense of comedy. His transition to animation, stop motion animation no less, is smart, funny and a pleasure. Is it his best film? Of course not, but it's one of the more enjoyable ones.The voice cast all work well, Clooney does a good job as the lead. He has that leadership tone in his voice, that arrogance that is needed for the character. Streep isn't given much to do, so her role as the wife is pretty basic, as is the character. Their son Ash, voice by Bored To Death star Jason Schwartzman was a stand out for me, as was Eric Chase Anderson, as Kristofferson. That name might not sound familiar, that's because his resume only consists of Anderson films. Bill Murray plays a badger and Fox's lawyer, who advises him not to buy the tree house. Fox does anyway and that's why he's in this mess. The animals are really small and live in this world where there are apparently small motorbikes for them to use. They can communicate with the human characters, no one seems to find it odd in this little world they live in. You won't find it odd either, you'll just be enjoying the fun.Each chapter is subtitled, Fox's Master Plan A, Fox's Master Plan B, etc. They even tell you how time passes in human years and fox years and in a comical bit one human hour compare to one fox hour. You never know how long these hours are in comparison to each other, you don't want to know either, it just adds to the uniqueness of the film. At heart, these characters are still wild animals, as Fox even says this in the film, and the way they eat and ""fight"" each other proves this.The film has that Anderson humour and might go over some kids heads. It's dark in some places, as one character dies, but I think they will enjoy it. They won't jump up and down for it like Up, or Finding Nemo. They won't want to go out and buy the latest Mr. Fox stuffed animal or toy. This feels more like a film for adults, it doesn't really cater to the kids, but they will have their bits to laugh at, like the possum who stares blankly at some people for whatever reason.This film was made from scratch, this world Anderson creates is fun and I had a fun time being in it. The film flies by it's running time and I never found the film dragging. It was in and out. As stated before, the kids might enjoy this, but it's more for adults. There's smoking and there's even a unique way of swearing, which I found funny. The camera movements scream Wes Anderson and if you're a fan, then you will enjoy this very much.One of my favourite films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Truly 'Fantastic' Fantastic Mr. Fox,"In recent years, Disney's Pixar division, with their monopoly over animation, has churned out some of the biggest, funniest, most emotional material to hit theaters in the last ten years. By this point, the public knows their aggressive marketing campaign and knows it well. Adult humor and themes geared not only toward the kids, but the parent's as well. The mass appeal? Mom and dad can now take their eight year old to the local multiplex and fork over the steep price of admission without wasting it on a two hour long power nap. Last quarter's CGI constructed Pixar extravaganza ""Up"" captured audiences' hearts, imaginations and pocket books, raking in a less than modest 292 mil at the box office, making it one of the highest grossing animated films of all time. Along comes ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", helmed by auteur Wes Anderson, a crack team at Twentieth-Century Fox (Yes, I said Fox) and Indian Paintbrush, one of Wes' collaborators on his predecessor ""The Darjeeling Limited"". If there's one thing that's detrimental to the Trump-like successes of the Disney powerhouse, it's a new found competitionlet the games begin.""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a pure delight. A feast for the eyes. From frame one, it takes no time at all to draw you into its beautiful visuals of vast countryside's, running streams and falling foliage, all in marvelous stop motion. That's right I said it, stop motion. From the course hair on Fox's face to the cotton ball chimney smoke of Boggis, Bunce and Beans warehouse smoke stacks, everything's been designed from scratch, much of which involves simple household items. After just a few minutes in Wes Andersons world inspired by written cues from the mind of the British children's author Roald Dahl (inspired by Dahl's own hometown) you're dragged out of the theater and immersed in a faraway land for the entirety of its modest and to the point one hour and twenty minute runtime. The real treat lies in the notion of how long it actually must have taken these top notch art designers to bring everything to life. There are forces at play here that give one a clear sense of the fact that stepping away from a computer screen and getting things done the hard way pays off when witnessing the final product. Production value is staggeringly noticeable and truly memorable. I for one am still transfixed by the universe of Mr. Fox.Among one of the droves of Wes Anderson fans, I had high expectations going into the film. Anderson is one of those rare writer/directors that manage to separate themselves from the societal norm, branch out and go their own way. With Fantastic Mr. Fox, he effortlessly supersedes his reputation as one of the most unique Directors of this century. You may be asking yourself how you direct a bunch of puppets, but Andersons 'puppets' are among some of the most realistic and complex that you're likely to meet. With human emotions, expressions and actions, it is clear that Mr. Anderson took great time and preparation during the film's production and pre-production to make sure everything came off as smoothly and impactful as possible. Look out for a particularly funny scene during one of the nightly stake outs portrayed wholly through images on security camera monitors. Very, very well thought out and clever.Fox, for being aimed at children, is probably one of the most adult animated films I've seen to date. Think Pixar Redux. There's smoking, 'cussing' and above all some extremely heavy handed adult humor and themes. In Wes Andersons sharp, funny, unbelievably witty script, he keeps all of that classic dry comedy that's become synonymous with his trademark, the only exception being that it's coming from the mouths of the animals he's intricately created. Parts had me gasping for air; others had me rolling in the aisles. It's clear to me that by now Wes has really honed in on his craft and gets marginally better with each new picture.Wes Anderson, with his creative brain that can only be compared to an Einstein of the medium, lays all his cards on the table and ups the ante for Pixar Studios. When asked if he wanted to continue to make animated films he commented by saying, ""I would certainly love to make other animated films in the future."" Could this be his new calling? Truly focusing on the niche market of animated movies tipping the scale more in favor of adult audiences? One would love to think so (of course without turning into another Robert Zemeckis and taking a permanent vacation from live action). Fantastic Mr. Fox is something to be experienced. Children will love its adorable characters while adults will marvel in its ability to connect with them. After all, each of us was a kid at one time or another and because of that there has never been a better excuse to pretend again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sartre and Satire,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is acclaimed director Wes Anderson's first animation, specifically stop-motion, and it's, well, fantastic.George Clooney's voice as the head fox of an animal clan that shouts diversity is straight out of Danny Ocean-- cool and witty with an overlay of sentimentality that would convince you to open your hen house door to let him have his way. That's after his little speech that tries existentialism on for size, foxwise that is: ""Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a beetle, or a bald eagle? I'm saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know? Who am I?""As the animals pull a caper against farmer Bean (Michael Gambon) and his thugs, the animation pulls away from the gloom of another winner this year, Where the Wild Things Are, and confirms the fun of a well told beast fable with loads of anthropomorphism to reaffirm our love of humanity and confirm that animals, like us, will always be animals. The ease with which Anderson/Clooney convince that this stealing and mayhem are what animals do is a tribute to script and performance that seduce us into the stylistic den of thieves known as the fox lair and all its attitude and custom, sanctioned by mother nature herself.Mr. Fox: ""The cuss am I? Are you cussing with me?"" Badger (Bill Murray): ""No, you cussing with me?"" Mr. Fox: ""Don't cussing point at me!""Such an exchange is indicative of the fun Anderson has with kids and adults by not bombarding the youngsters with profanity but winking at the adults as if to say, ""You know what I mean."" And the most violent moment comes not from scenes with guns but rather where the animals steal chickens and break their necks, done so gingerly and quietly that it seems what it is: Just what foxes do and what humans must do to eat the chickens. Darwin meets the cartoons: Mr. Fox: ""And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?""That's Wes Anderson for you: Sartre and satire with a dash of dashing fox.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Wonderful Return to Classic Animation,"I'll admit it: I love stop motion animation. From the crude Christmas classics that are always on TV this time of year to the elegant masterpieces of Tim Burton, I never miss the chance to see classic animation at work. Needless to say, when I heard about Fantastic Mr. Fox, I was excited. A wonderful Rhold Dahl book, beautifully crafted animation, and an illustrious cast all in one package – this was exciting. I'm happy to say that my excitement was justified as Fantastic Mr. Fox is perhaps one of the best new movies I have seen this year.The story of Fantastic Mr. Fox follows the lives of the Fox family – Mr (George Clooney), Mrs(Meryl Streep), and their son(Jason Schwartzman) – and their animal neighbors and friends. Mr. Fox, once a professional chicken stealer, decides to settle down with his wife after she becomes pregnant and instead take up a career in writing. After moving to a new home in the trunk of a tree, Mr. Fox takes notice in three massive fowl and fruit farms. Risking everything. Mr. Fox decides to embark on one last big job – stealing from all three farms. What happens after that can only be described as pure confusion and debauchery.As with most Rhold Dahl stories, the book Fantastic Mr. Fox works to both excite kids and humor adults. As a result, the original short story is considered a classic for many families. Though some adaptations of Rhold Dahl classics (see BOTH adaptations of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) have strayed from Dahl's dry, quirky humor, the film version of one of his best loved stories have honored this side of Dahl's story, projecting a humor perhaps more suited to adults than children, but creating an overall story that will appeal to all.This movie would likely have been impossible without the work of numerous wonderful voice actors. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Owen Wilson all provide voices in the movie, among other lesser known but still wonderfully talented actors. As a result, the voices blend beautifully into the animation. Instead of feeling like characters with a voice shoved in, the voices and the characters are one.The animation is perhaps the most appealing aspect of the movie. The script and humor works with the animation in ways traditional or digital animation could not. In many instances, the animation itself provides part of the story. By using a more traditional method, Fantastic Mr. Fox is also able to provide very specific quirks and personalities to each character, something often lost in newer animation. Adding to the animation is a muted, fall palette of colors, giving the entire film a homey, comforting feel.Animation has become so perverted in recent years. Throwing away emotional appeal for visual appeal, the plethora of slick, computer animated, shiny films are almost unnerving. In such an atmosphere, choosing to make a use traditional animation can often spell anathema for the film. As a result, Fantastic Mr. Fox shines, choosing to pick traditional animation techniques to allow the viewer to relate to and communicate with the film in a way few films are able to do anymore. Though perhaps not for everyone, I would recommend Fantastic Mr. Fox for anyone interested in quirky humor, stop-motion animation, or simply a beautifully crafted and well written story.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Top 10 Favorite Movies,"I love this movie. The visuals, the endearment from the characters, the ARCS oh boy the character arcs in this movie are SO SO AMAZING. Anderson makes you feel and care for the characters from square one which is a supremely difficult task to do (most directors/writers instead employ making them dislikable because it's way easier). The visuals are top notch and super original which deserves + 1 star on its own so really this movie gets a 11/10 from me.The story and the overall effect of this movie to inspire artistic creations and not be afraid of telling a story from your unique perspective is what this movie should really be looked on about. It's a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
a marvelous clubhouse of a movie where we're all invited to laugh and feel happy,"I made a diorama in third grade of Fantastic Mr. Fox- a book which I loved fondly- and seeing this film brought me back to that, only better and bolder, but with the same handmade quality of someone awed by the world they read. It's also wildly funny and cheerfully light-and-heavy all at once. It brings director Wes Anderson's concerns as a filmmaker to light, as usual (dysfunctional family, idiosyncratic touches with the characters, absurd child-but-adult-like comedy), and in a setting that is a fantasy that anyone can attach to. Children will latch on to it because of its cute/creepy designs, and its raucous energy. Adults will eat it up because, like with Where the Wild Things Are, it brings us back to a time when we just want to have a fun time and do things, even if we might know or thing they're wrong, or maybe just to dance at very odd moments.Mr. Fox (George Clooney, who else?) is a sly guy with a quick mouth and a caring manner. He is a wild animal though, which is why he breaks the promise he made to his wife to not go out and steal chickens after their first child is born. He can't help it really- those nasty trio of farmers, Boggis Bunce and Bean- have all of those chickens and deliciously alcoholic apple cider just waiting for the taking. As it turns out, this makes the farmers angry as hell (or rather Bean mostly, who at one point does one of those manic 'destroy everything in the house' reactions Kane might appreciate), and they go and destroy the Fox home and all the outlying areas.From there it becomes a battle of wills and, sometimes, real fire power and acorn-bombs and a rabid dog and other wild craziness. Oh, and the stop-motion. Thanks be to someone out there: there's filmmakers still going through the painstaking but endlessly creative process of frame-by-frame film-making where it takes dozens of hours to get just a few seconds of film. People like Anderson and Henry Selick seek out the limitations so they can break through them, or toy around with them as much as possible.With the characterization of 'Mr. Fox', Anderson and his animation team gives us creatures whose hair is always slightly blowing in the wind (something that must have been hard to attain being shot frame by frame), have eyes that are motorized and look like real human eyes almost, and water (or apple cider) when it flows becomes rather dreamlike and appears like we haven't seen it before. That all of the characters have something amazing to their features, be it the way Mr. Fox gnarls his teeth and then does his trademark whistle or to how Rat clicks his fingers like a West Side Story villain, there's something happening every other second. You might figure out how this is all done, but it's not as much concern as what they do with their creations, like kids with action figures making an epic on 8mm film.Fantastic Mr. Fox has the childlike wonder, the modestly dazzling sets and production design (art-Anderson is basically the way to put it by now with his films, from the title cards of species identification to maps and chapter-headings), and an original sense of perspective when it comes to action scenes and simple little camera moves that comes off extraordinary in this setting. But it's also, mostly, hysterically funny. It's not a crude funny like the Hangover or too bizarre like the Men Who Stare at Goats. It's sometimes just plain awkward, or just totally unexpected, or built around an absurdity that comes up and down like the explanation of how to play Whackbat, or Mrs. Bean and her blindness. Or just a line of dialog (""He's just another rat found in the back of a Chinese restaurant"") sets off a belly laugh that's hard to contain. This is, at the least, the funniest of all the Dahl adaptations, keeping to the surrealism of animals and humans alike, while sticking to a perfectly dry, off-handed approach by its filmmaker.As with everything else in the movie, the comedy feels home-grown, not in a Hollywood lab where everything's tested. This goes too for the excellent voice work that brings Anderson/Baumbach's dialog to fruition. In the theatrical trailer, when first seen, the voices of Clooney and Streep and Bill Murray almost distracted from the quality of the animation. But in full context, they all work, even Anderson himself as a real-estate agent creature. And the outdoor-not-in-studio recording of the voices does add something extra: you feel like there's something real going on, not just in fantasy, thanks to the actors and their ""on-set"" work. I'm sure some extra ideas or expressiveness came out of this, because the performances are a great part of what makes this world so tangible: we know these people and animals, sort of, at least as much as any other Wes Anderson movie.And sure, they're foxes, but why not connect with the theme while we're at it? The film is lovely and insane, smart and silly, lovable and (for a few moments) a little scary, with a kick-ass soundtrack straight out of a record collection (and musical store) that connects just right right this spectacular place of someplace-England. And hey, why not some existentialism to top it off: ""Who am I? And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?"" How indeed? ""I don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds illegal.""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I have mixed feelings on this one,"What exactly is the Fantastic Mr. Fox? Since it's a feature cartoon based on a Roald Dahl story one might assume it would be a movie for kids, or a movie for kids of all ages, but it's not. The dysfunctional family and the arch dialog and the low-key performances all make it clear this is something for adults, something aiming to be a quirky way to deliver Anderson's typical fare. Or perhaps it actually does aim to be a kid's film and this was simply the closes Anderson could come.In either case, the movie doesn't totally work for me. Even though I never read the Roald Dahl story, I know his work well enough to know that this has little to do with it. Anderson and Dahl have very different sensibilities. But at the same time, they are both quirky. I think if Anderson wanted to take a kid's story and give it a modernist twist he would have been better off with something less quirky, a more traditional children's story like The Wizard of Oz. As it is, the two varieties of quirkiness work against each other. Anderson is small and thoughtful and acerbic, Dahl is over-the-top and ironic and somewhat savage. And while Anderson wins this debate, because he has the final word, the vestiges of Dahl make it all feel a bit off.This is not to say I didn't enjoy the movie. I generally did. It's mildly amusing and the animation is kind of interesting in places. I didn't particularly mind watching it. But I was never drawn into the world, I never felt connected with the characters or concerned about their plight. The movie, like all Wes Anderson films, keeps you at a distance from the characters, but unlike his best movies, it doesn't make up for that with enough eccentricity to keep one engaged.It doesn't surprise me that the critics loved this movie. Critics tend to get jaded and immediately latch onto anything different, and this movie is decidedly different. But Anderson would have been better off either making a cartoon aimed at kids or making a live action show aimed at adults. Instead, he just confuses the two.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Endearing and hugely enjoyable,"For those who are looking for a 100% faithful adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, I think they will be disappointed. Lacking the dark edge of Dahl's book and of his writing in general, Fantastic Mr Fox is not so good as an adaptation, however on its own terms it is wonderful. It is an endearing and hugely enjoyable film.One thing that stood out was how the film looked. Instead of the CGI rendered effects, Wes Anderson opts for a more old-fashioned stop-motion effect. This decision worked, because the visual look is outstanding, not just in the beautifully detailed backgrounds and sets but in how the characters move as well and the small details such as the armchair in his writing hut.I like Alexandre Desplat's music quite a bit. His score for Fantastic Mr Fox is no exception, it is quirky yet still has the minimalist style that makes Desplat stand out. The story is sometimes slow in the pace but because of the humour and how it looked, I never found the film boring, besides the story itself is so good. The writing is great, the humour is more adult but a vast majority of it is very funny with the odd touching moment too.The characters add a lot. Mr Fox is one of my favourite titular characters in a book and the film did little to change that, and while some are slightly underused they serve their purpose well. The voice work is fantastic. I wasn't sure about George Clooney, but he does do a bravura job, and Meryl Streep is quite touching. Michael Gambon is sterling, as is Bill Murray as Badger.In conclusion, hugely enjoyable and one of my personal favourites of 2009. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Charming, with some dull spots","Whimsical and often charming- Fantastic Mr. Fox does have some hiccups in terms of pacing- but in the end proves to be a very unique and fun little film. I'll start with the flaws of the film. I watched this film in 3 parts, considering it was about 90 minutes, about 30 mins a part, and the second part did prove to be a bit of a drag. It was slow, it had some cliche moments, and much of it had been done before in other similar movies. I also didn't really care for the conflict storyline between Kristofferson and Ash, and really just felt like it detracted from the film and its story. Besides that though, the film was pretty fun to watch. The visuals are incredibly intricate and well done, the cinematography is excellent, and the stop motion animation is quite detailed and unique making for a very fun visual feast. The film also proves to be quite quirky with how it presents itself, in perfect Wes Anderson style, and has some really funny jokes I enjoyed much more now than I did as a kid. In the end, Fantastic Mr. Fox isn't my favorite animated flick, nor my favorite from Wes Anderson, but its parts are more charming than not and its visual style is impressive enough on its own to stand as a rather unique and memorable little movie.My Rating: 7.3/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An excellent animated film that will be especially appealing to Wes Anderson fans.,"""If what I think is happening IS happening...it better not be.""I never would have guessed that Wes Anderson would venture into the world of  stop motion animation, but after seeing The Fantastic Mr. Fox, I have to admit that it's a natural fit. I think having the unlimited creative license that animation provides really let him indulge his creativity, and a absolutely great movie was the result.Anderson and Noah Baumbach took the classic Roald Dahl story and greatly expanded the beginning and end, while giving it a unique look and tone that is quite different from other recent animation. It's still essentially about a fox who steals from three local farmers in order to provide from his family, and brings a lot of trouble on all the nearby animals as a result, but the story is now fleshed out beyond that. This is an Anderson movie through and through, with all the eccentric characters, wonderful music, complicated family dynamics, and understated, off-beat humor that the world has come to expect from his work.It's difficult to find any part of Fantastic Mr. Fox to raise a complaint about. The animation, character designs and sets are beautiful, the cast of actors and actresses brought in to do the voice acting were all excellent, and the movie as a whole was just charming. Along with Ponyo and Coraline, I'd say that this is among the best animated films I've seen in quite a while. Even better than Pixar's excellent recent work. I really hope that Anderson makes something like this again in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A visual treat but style definitely trumps substance,"This is one of those films I really wanted to love. I grew up on Roald Dahl and really liked the book, probably one of his most charming stories. However, while I really liked some aspects of the movie, it fell a bit short of being memorable.I will say that the graphics are an absolute treat throughout this film. The stop motion animation is amazing and the sepia tones really work for me. I find that the majority of 21st century animated films are visually overwhelming with far too much happening on the screen. I often feel that the producers are more concerned with showing what they are capable of doing rather than what they should be doing. Fantastic Mr Fox is one of the few exceptions. It is quaint and charming and matches the feel of the book very nicely.Unfortunately, I felt the telling of the story just got a bit messy. It was not close enough to the original and felt unnecessarily complex at times, especially given the target audience. My other big gripe was with the American accents. I understand the draw of big Hollywood stars, but this story really demands well-spoken English actors. Sir Ian McKellen as Mr Fox with Ricky Gervais as the Rat could have been epic! Having said that, George Clooney did a pretty good job and grew on me as the movie went on.Ultimately, I felt this was a beautiful production but one that lacked any real substance. I would still recommend it to anyone based on the remarkable animation but it's not something I'd rush to see again.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Thoroughly Enjoyable,"To put it simply, Fantastic Mr. Fox is unlikely to leave you disappointed.For a start, the animation, is simply wonderful. Gorgeously designed backgrounds and scenery full of simply incredible attention to detail, the film is full of such loving care and attention. Each character feels full of personality and it's refreshing to see something other than a glossy 3D rendered animation film for a change most certainly. It feels like a return to a day where a little imagination was expected in films, which is nice.Comparing Pixar releases and this film is besides the point. This film wasn't made to be compared or compete with others, it was made to tell a classic children's tale by one of the greatest authors at writing them. Dahl's wife Felicity herself has described her delight at how the film portrays the universe great author created and the modification of the story for film length is smoothly and smartly done. It is a beautifully told story, heart-warming and charming, witty and full of comedic moments.While Pixar films play like films made for children that can be enjoyed by adults. Wes Anderson's film feels like one made for adults, that can be enjoyed by children. Some parents may not feel too comfortable of the less than subtle replacement of curse words with ""cuss"" or ""cussing"" it has to be mentioned however.The voice acting is excellently done, Anderson took the cast outside, underground and indoors for the varying parts of the film to give it a real feel of authenticity which pays off. The soundtrack, as with all Wes Anderson films, is stunningly good and really elevates the film. After watching you may find yourself searching out the soundtrack as soon as you get home.The film's style and direction screams Wes Anderson at the top of its lungs and so, haters of his previous work may need to be careful, but I would certainly suggest to give the film a try and see if it can convert you, if not at least not make you feel like you've wasted your money.As a self confessed Wes Anderson fan I was doomed to love this film no matter what, but am genuinely delighted with the end product and believe that more than just the blind Wes Anderson lover will find this film a charming, witty ride of enjoyment.",,Anonymous,Animation
Among the best of Wes Anderson's and kids movies in general!,"Should've won the 2 nominated Oscars that year! Amazing story telling in stop motion, cinematography, soundtrack, delightful dialogue throughout, choreography, and comedy! I love that they say cuss instead of using any profanity. A grand good family flick with heists and wonderful characters where they have to avoid formidable foes or defeat them in some parts. Wes Anderson's films are so legendary they should be more appreciated and he deserves more awards!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great Dialog, Visual Make This A Winner For Adults","I would think the audience is limited for this kind of animated film but, thank goodness, I'm one of those people who loved it. Apparently, a lot of other reviewers here did, too. There is a lot to appreciate about this movie.""Fox"" is written for other adults, let's be honest. This isn't a kids' movie because most of the dialog would go right over their heads. However, intelligent adults - people especially with a good vocabulary and a quirky sense of humor - should love ""Fantastic Mr. Fox.""The hero is even voiced by a real-life elitist, George Clooney. The smug-sounding Mr. Clooney does a super job in the lead voice role of ""Mr. Fox."" The same goes for the villainous ""Mr. Bean,"" voiced by the nasty-sounding Michael Gambon. The details in the drawings also come through nicely in the Blu-Ray version, so see it in that formula if you have a BD player and HD set. Thus, this film offers great visuals along with the wonderful dialog.The story is typical; a father finds out his family is more important than anything else and his young son tries to win approval from dad - but how this is executed is really ""clever"" to both see and hear. Yes, it's a cliché story but it's done so differently with such unique dialog and humor that it's fantastically entertaining.If you think animated films are strictly for the young; this movie will change your mind. Best of all, it's the type of movie you should be able to enjoy multiple times because there is so much to take in.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
No other director could do this any better.,"I went into this with high expectations, and I was not disappointed.Firstly, the director is Wes Anderson, a great director who has made this great film possible. I think this film is truly underrated for an animated film, if you think of an animated film, what comes to mind, Toy Story, Cars or The Incredibles, some of the most popular animated films out there, however I think this beats all of those. With Wes Anderson quirky claymation style, symmetrical camera shots and the vibrant colour palette all makes this film great. Suitable for all ages, this eccentric adventure is sure to make anyone laugh with its humorous dry wit that the director is known for. This film is not at all boring due to it putting you into the action within ten minutes, and it's carries on this fast pace style through the whole film. Finally, to tie it all together is the soundtrack, worthy of it's Oscar nomination, it brings joy to all those watching. All of these elements great this into a near perfect film by Wes Anderson.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good production is worthless without a good script,"Technically speaking, the movie is very well-done. Interesting animation with an old-school charm, good soundtrack and famous names, such as Wes Anderson, George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson, led me to watch this film with somewhat high expectations. Audio-visually the movie did not disappoint, but the story itself was really lousy. It is probably pretty good for pre-teen children, but to me, it was quite boring. And do not fall for advertising - this team has to make much more effort to acquire the right to the comparison with Pixar.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
It Was Fantastic!,"I have never been so absorbed by a group of animated figures. Even more impressive than the stop action process used here (it must have taken forever), is a delightful set of people/animals that charm us and make us care. As with all Roald Dahl children's books, we get to see the dark side of humanity, no punches pulled. The animals are a combination of their natural propensities and ""human"" qualities. The story involves an upwardly mobile fox, voiced by George Clooney, who wants the best for his family, but can't seem to avoid killing chickens or robbing the people who live on the edge of his domain. He is a ""wild animal"" and this makes it hard for him to restrain himself. He is also quite irresponsible but so charming that he can talk his way out of anything. Into the mix is his faithful wife (who really gets fed up with him) and a son who is small, aspires to be an athlete, and is in the throes of teenage low self-esteem. A whiz kid cousin come to visit and upsets the apple cart. Ultimately, the actions of Mr. Fox bring about a battle with the dangerous humans and the fun begins. This is a delight to look at. Even if you're not into ""children's"" animated films, I became totally absorbed.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Close to perfection,The amazing world created by Roald Dahl is exquisitely brought to the silver screen by director Wes Anderson who once again shows his talent. The voice acting in the film was also a joy to behold. Every voice actor played their role as needed while the ones standing out were Michael Gambon and George Clooney. The pacing of the film was not rushed even if the short runtime might suggest otherwise. The characters were imagined beautifully.As a whole the movie stands out as one of my favourites ever and gets close to perfection.,10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I tried to like it...,"After viewing the film, I was truly shocked to see such a high rating on IMDb.'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an adaption of a beloved children's classic, portraying the story of the smooth, slick protagonist Mr. Fox (or 'Foxy') as he attempts one 'last' heist to steal from the dreaded Boggins, Bunce and Bean. That's right, one short, one fat, one lean, or however it goes.I don't quite know where to start with my criticism.Well, I'm in my late teens and was never a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material well enough, having read a few of his books as a child and seen Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory over and over again. This film, however, struggles for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adults? I'm still unsure! Many of the 'jokes' would bore a child, especially as Mr. Fox visits a lawyer for example, or complains about being poor. Also, an audience of (I'm assuming) children is expected to sympathise with a character who steals and kills chickens. I'm all for the food chain, but you practically see Mr. Fox biting down on their necks! Surely that's a bit much? And also, the plot... well, it's kind of boring. I stayed only with the hope of it getting better, but instead I just got more and more annoyed at Mr Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions.The humour, meanwhile, falls flat. I laughed only once or twice, even though I specifically recognised attempts at jokes. I think part of it is that the voice acting is so incredibly flat and monotoned. The voice actors have no sense of comic timing, instead aiming for the subtlety of humour that only works with certain mediums. George Clooney aims to portray Mr. Fox as charming and sleek, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I didn't even realise Bill Murray had a role until the end credits, and Ash, twelve-years old in fox-years, sounds like he's about 30.I love animation, particularly stop motion, but the visual style actually creeped me out a little bit. Characters are tall, spindly and lacking any warmth of design. They move with very little fluidity and often the animation is jerky and strange. There is also a distinctive 'mixed medium' feel, as 2D components are added in sporadically and unsuccessfully. Characters look straight at the camera and talked; it was very awkward. There was one or two moments when Kylie looked straight at the camera, didn't move and had swirls on his eyeballs. It actually freaked me out.Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential. Lots of people still seem to like it - look at the reviews. Maybe it just wasn't for me.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming but underwhelming,"I can't believe I'm going against the grain on this. It's not a terrible film, in fact it's absolutely charming to look at, but when the gorgeous visuals and aesthetic are taken away, I'm left with a pretty muddy narrative and flat characterization.",,Anonymous,Animation
Quite original but would be NOTHING without Mr. Fox,"A fox, formerly a bird thief, tries to keep living a straight life. He has a family, a job with the newspaper, and a fancy new house in a strong tree. Unfortunately his tree overlooks the farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean (one short, one fat, one mean), three of the meanest farmers in the world. Along with his Badger friend, Mr. Fox plans one last big heist: stealing from all three men. Unfortunately, they don't just roll over and take it, and Mr. Fox is soon in quite a predicament.This movie is animated....kind of. It is done in a similar stop-motion style such as that of ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" only much creepier. Honestly if I saw this movie as a kid, it probably would have given me nightmares - not because the movie is scary, but the animation itself is quite terrifying, in my humble opinion.For those of you who know me, you are aware that I am not a big fan of what I call ""artsy films,"" and Wes Anderson is a major creator of these. Such movies as Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Darjeeling Limited are all critically acclaimed films that I really didn't care for...maybe it's just me. SOME parts of Mr. Fox are quite reminiscent of these previously listed movies, but somehow it is not as annoying.I had low expectations after the first few minutes. Even when the movie was over I really didn't know what to think about it. However, after letting it marinade in my brain for a few hours, I reached the conclusion that the movie was pretty good.The Good: George Clooney definitely made Mr. Fox a more intriguing character than he would have been had anyone else done the voice over. I also thought Franklin Bean was an entertaining (and quite vicious) villain. Too bad Boggis and Bunce weren't as interesting. Also Willem Dafoe was awesome as The Rat. Two great scenes that stand out to me are when Mr. Fox is making the final plan and calling everyone by their Latin names, and the part at the end with the wolf (Canis Lupus!), though don't ask me why. I loved that the movie had extremely dirty language but still got a PG rating---the solution: replace every place where a swear word was used with the word ""curse."" GENIUS! Someone can just say ""What the curse are you talking about?"" Adults can fill in the blank and kids don't know what he meant. Very original. For a technical compliment, the music and scenery were also quite good.The Bad: Most characters that are not Mr. Fox are not very interesting. The movie is not lying about being about Mr. Fox. Was it just me or did his wife only have about 4 lines in the entire movie, all of which were extremely dry and mono toned? Mr. Fox's son was also terribly annoying as the angsty teen fox. Also like I said before, the animation is horrifying.Overall Fantastic Mr. Fox was *just* shy of being fantastic, but I'd definitely give it a recommendation, especially if you like Wes Anderson. I would probably watch it again, but not until after the nightmares stop.Final Score - 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Can't Stand Wes Anderson!!!,"To me - and I know many, many people will disagree - Wes Anderson is another one of those directors whose movies I only like one of - I actually quite enjoyed The Life Aquatic (mostly because of Bill Murray and the quality stop-motion animation), but that's it. Everything else he does is just irritatingly boring, dull and completely unfunny. I've tried to like his movies, but I just can't. I hate directors whose movies are odd for the sake of being odd, and not because it's funny or it makes sense; it's just downright pretentious. He's not even weird or odd in a good way like David Lynch. Some might argue that his humour is too sophisticated or high-brow for my caveman mind, fair enough, I'm just here to speak my mind. This review is applicable to all Wes Bentley films (except Aquatic), so hopefully I won't have to keep repeating myself. Oh, another thing; I absolutely can't stand Jason Schwartzman!

This is a very well done family film that is a bit underrated,"Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time with my daughter on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a Fox who used to be a thief but has settled down with a wife and children. When his life gets boring and resources short he reverts back to his old ways putting his and his family's lives at risk.This movie is directed by Wes Anderson (Moonrise Kingdom) and contains the voices of George Clooney (Ocean's 11), Bill Murray (Ghostbusters), Meryl Streep (The Devil Wears Prada), Owen Wilson (Wedding Crashers), Willem Dafoe (Platoon) and Michael Gambon (Harry Potter).The animation for this is very unique and fun to watch unfold. The writing is brilliant. The storyline is very random and unpredictable as are the characters. You never know what someone is going to say or do. The voices are very well selected and fit the characters perfectly. There's some cool camera angles during the action scenes, especially towards the end. There's times you watch this and it feels like a video game. There's also some good coming of age elements that are heartfelt and have an authentic feel.Overall this is a very well done family film that is a bit underrated.

One of the best movies of 2009!,"This film had one of the most unappealing trailers I've seen, due to the 'old-school' animation, but I had to see this because of Anderson's reputation and the positive response from the critics. I'm glad I did because this is a movie I thoroughly enjoyed. Once you pass the initial few minutes the animation style actually grows on you as a fantastic story unveils. The soundtrack is crisp and the movie has some great characters. This is one of the best roles Clooney has played. His voice was perfect for the lead character.I have always appreciated Anderson's movies for their originality, but they have always missed the mark of greatness. This one however did excel due to its great plot, pacing, music, and characters.Despite having plenty of clever laughs Fox is not really for children. There is a certain complexity in the mix which makes it more fun for adults than kids I would think (much like Coroline and Where the Wild Things are).Overall, this is one of my favorite films of the year and the best movie Anderson has made.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining but nothing exceptional,"This stop motion animation is about a clever fox who stopped stealing for a living after his son was born. He steals again many years later, with drastic consequences.""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" has elements to keep people interested. I like the abundance of funny scenes, as it works magic in the film. Visuals are nice and the characters are likable to look at. I find the plot quite straight forward, and even a little too plain in some parts. There are little ups and downs to keep the thrill going.

Good but overrated,"I watched that movie because of all the hype that was going on around it and I have to say it was a very enjoyable film.I haven't watched many Wes Anderson films,there seems to be a bit much of a controversy around his name,everyone saying he is a ""love him or leave him"" kind of director.Same saying goes around for this movie.I believe this film is really overrated.Everyone goes like ""This is like nothing you have ever seen before"",""Magnificent on both aesthetic and entertaining level"" and such.Personally I don't find it that pleasing,nor unique on the aesthetic level.I am a fan of stop motion animation and I have to say that I have seen MUCH MORE better works on that field aesthetically.Damn almost every stop motion movie since Nightmare Before Christmass I have seen is better aesthetically.Nightmare Before Christmass,Coraline,Paranorman,Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run,all i consider to be a better job in terms of stop motion animation.Not even talking about Kubo and the two strings...And as far as it goes for the story and everyone talking about how surreal it is...Again Nightmare Before Christmass,Coraline and James And The Giant Peach are surreal, not Fantastic Mr Fox.It's like something we have commonly seen in plain 3d animation stories only that it has many more americanized elements and a more real feel to it.Nowhere near surreal.As long as I was watching the film I constantly had a feeling like I was watching a common American robbery movie like The gang of eleven,Now you see me and other bank robbery movies compressed into a stop motion environment.All and all,it was an enjoyable film but I don't understand the hype about it.For the people saying it's a hate it or love it film I am here to disprove them.I liked it but considering I am a stop motion fan,it was too non surreal and aesthetically mediocre to love it",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fantastic Mr. Fox,"The eponymous character lives with his wife and son in their foxhole under a great big tree. He's still got a traditional mischief gene, though, and is determined to use it one last time to rob the three, ruthless, farmers who live nearby. What he doesn't think through is that these farmers are not dimwits. They know exactly who is pilfering from them and so determine to avenge themselves on him and his family by digging them out of their home and, well a siege and a trip to the sewers now ensue for the all of the subterranean families. George Clooney and Meryl Streep lead the vocal cast - and they are great - but for me, the star of the whole thing is Sir Michael Gambon's wonderful contribution as their principal, wonderfully odious, antagonist ""Bean"". The animation is simple and effective to watch and the writing is frequently pithy offering plenty for the older audience to take from this entertaining critique on responsibility, greed, revenge, loyalty - you name it, it's probably here somewhere. Roald Dahl had an amazing imagination and by imbuing the foxes with human traits (and the humans with some animal ones) here, he makes an whole load of attributes accessible to the audience in a more enjoyably tangential manner - traits that are not always honourable ones, neither. These role reversals work well and make you wonder if humanity is really just in the purview of people! Great fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Erractic Mr. Fox,"The base for ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the beloved children's book by British iconic author Roald Dahl. As in the original the film focuses on life ordeals of Mr. Fox and his family. The premise for the story is Mr. Fox's stealing spree of chickens, ducks, turkeys and cider, which make him top of the most wanted list of despicable farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Unlike in the original instead of a fox basically trying to cater and feed his family in this outing we have a typical dysfunctional Wes Anderson family, whose papa is addicted to stealing. Not to mention that his son is an irritating little bugger, whilst you also get a key new addition of kick-boxing super-athlete cousin Kristofferson . Oh! And did I mention that all the animals in the forest are Americans (which really makes the movie jar throughout, as the characters are cool hipster forest animals). Meanwhile the farmers remaining outstandingly British.I can and will forgive the scriptwriter (Wes Anderson) for basically taking a dump on the whole sense, premise and feeling of the story. I will in this case treat ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" as something totally unrelated to the book (which remains outside of Anderson's capabilities to ever achieve as long as he resolves to sticking to his gameplan).I will not however gloss over the fact, that the animation has neither the humour and wit of Nick Park, the intelligence and unforgettable charm of Hayao Miyazaki or the heart of Pixar. The only thing that Anderson has is... quirkiness. I have never seemed to be able to understand the almost unanimous critic appeal of Wes Anderson (albeit his cult adoration thankfully does not seem to extend too far outside American borders). I never found his movies profound, if anything to me they reeked of pretentious artsy drivel (including the underwhelming ""Rushmore""). Additionally Wes Anderson seems to be incapable of directing movies with likable leads - even in ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" the charmless title character played by George Clooney sounds like a George Clooney with a persistent headache on Valium impression. The only actor that manages to ring true is Meryl Streep as Ms. Fox, but her role is relatively insignificant and secondary. As usual I also found the lines nowhere as deep, meaningful and brilliant as Anderson believes them to be. Actually they mostly felt flat and written by an adolescent during Sunday school. Whats worse the add-on quirky jokes are tragically unfunny and I found myself battling to even produce a single smirk during this ordeal.The worst thing is however that I have no idea who the target audience is. The plot plods along at snails pace and the characters are whiny, cajoling, boring and unlikeable with a unrelenting need to spit out inappropriate inside jokes (not to mention they are constantly 'cussing' with standout lines like: """"This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everyone"". What the cuss?). Additionally they are hard to understand due to seemingly inherent articulation flaws. Not to mention that some of the animation (one of the few brilliant things in the movie) is eerie, creepy and frightful in a very inappropriate manner. That basically means the whole base audience of kids is not suited for this visualisation of the children's book making it an obscure attempt at mainstream by Wes Anderson, which easily explains the poor sales of the movie.If we are to believe that this is an animation for adults, than well... I will never jump onto the Wes Anderson band waggon, even though I'm quite sure all the negative feedback I will get for my above review. I find Anderson's films unmemorable, unimaginative and tiresome dragging on like a snail with rheumatism. Basically a animation soap-opera.I would really love to catch the drift and hop on-board the Anderson love-boat, but with this dreadfully boring animation of a brilliant children's book this revelation will have to be put on hold. Until than count me out of this adoration.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Didn't work for me,"I finally saw this film almost four years after its original release, and have to say it did not work for me, for exactly the reasons that kept me from going to see it in the theater back in '09.The animation is good for the most part, but the changes to the story are forced and unnecessary, the voice acting by the all-star cast is shockingly bland and uninspired, and the whole thing is, in a maddening way, quirky just for quirky's sake. After the tenth time, the ""laconic comment followed by five seconds of awkward silence"" gag just isn't funny any more. Same with most of the music, it was just a placeholder for the Benny Hill Theme, because playing that over all the repetitive scenes of ""Foxy"" and his gang just moving about randomly would have been a little to obvious even for this flick.And yes, like many other reviewers I'm a huge fan of the book, but even when viewing this as a work of it's own - maybe especially then - it just does not hold up. It tries way to hard, its parts don't fit together nearly well enough, and it left me without any strong feelings whatsoever. It was overshadowed at the box office by ""Twilight 2"" and ""Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"", and as someone who hates both of these movies with a passion, I still have to say I understand why.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Wes Anderson, but stop-motion.","Wes Anderson's distinct aesthetic takes center stage in Fantastic Mr. Fox, a visually stunning feast for the eyes. Each meticulously crafted frame bursts with his signature symmetrical compositions, pastel color palettes, and quirky charm.Beyond the delightful visuals lies a surprisingly layered narrative. At its core, it's a heist film, albeit one executed with furry finesse. We root for the titular Mr. Fox (voiced with sly charisma by George Clooney) as he masterminds a daring raid on three notoriously grumpy farmers. But beneath the caper's thrills lies a poignant exploration of family, ambition, and the delicate balance between dreams and responsibility.Anderson's witty dialogue dances between whimsical humor and sly asides, peppered with enough deadpan wit to tickle even the most discerning funny bone. Willem Dafoe's turn as the manic badger Kristofferson is a scene-stealer, while Meryl Streep brings depth and grace to Mrs. Fox, the voice of reason amidst the furry pandemonium.The film's pacing might meander at times, but that's part of its charm. It allows us to savor the meticulously crafted world, the quirky characters, and the gentle humor. It's a movie that rewards repeat viewings, revealing new layers and nuances with each encounter.Ultimately, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a triumph of animation, storytelling, and pure cinematic joy. It's a five-star masterpiece that transcends its seemingly simple premise to offer a heartwarming and surprisingly complex portrait of family, ambition, and the enduring power of a well-executed heist (of the poultry variety, of course).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A pleasant and fun family movie,"Fantastic Mr. Fox was the very first movie directed by Wes Anderson that I ever saw, and I first saw it back in 2013, if I'm not mistaken. And while I've never actually read the original novel by Roald Dahl, I have always enjoyed it.After moving his family to a new home in a tree, Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) breaks a promise he made his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) to give up his days as a poultry thief after nearly getting them both killed at a squab farm 2 years (12 in fox-years) before, and secretly robs local human farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Succumbing to his inherent fox instincts puts his marriage, as well as the lives of himself, his family and their animal friends, on the line, when the farmers become determined to kill him in revenge. Forced deep below ground along with everyone he knows, Mr. Fox has no choice but to use his natural craftiness to rise above his foes, and gain the upper hand.Now, let me just say the animation is lovely. Not only are all the characters wonderfully designed, the puppets are well-sculpted and intricate, especially with the fur. Their movements are all fluid, and quite expressive, especially in the facial expressions. In addition, the set pieces are really lovely to look at. On the whole, this movie has a very charming and homey grandma's mantelpiece aesthetic to it. This is helped along by Wes Anderson's distinctive visual style of symmetrical, straight-angled framing, which has always translated wonderfully to stop-motion animation.In addition, the characters are very excellent. Mr. Fox is truly is Fantastic as a lead. Felicity is a loving and supportive wife, but she is certainly not without a temper. Their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman), is irritable, but we gradually see that he really just wants his dad's approval. His cousin, Kristofferson (Eric Anderson), is polite and kind, and even when he's upset, he's very soft-spoken. Mr. Fox's best friend, Kylie the Opossum (Wallace Wolodarsky), is very enjoyable. In regards to the farmers, Bean acts as a very menacing primary villain and he succeeds at it. Boggis and Bunce act as his lieutenants, and they're quite entertaining. His security rat, Rat (Willem Dafoe), makes a terrific secondary villain.Also, the voice-acting is on point. George Clooney is very sly and sharp-witted as Mr. Fox. Meryl Streep is compassionate and kind, but also very firm, headstrong and earnest as Felicity. Jason Schwartzman is terrific as Ash. Eric Anderson is really good as Kristofferson, soft-spoken, but never flat. Michael Gambon (may he rest in peace) is very threatening as Bean, as is Willem Dafoe as Rat. Other cast members include Bill Murray as lawyer Clive Badger, Owen Wilson as Coach Skip, Robin Hurlstone as Boggis, Hugo Guinness as Bunce, and all do fantastically with their roles.In addition, the writing is fantastic. The movie has a warm, fuzzy feel to it, and is quite pleasant in its tone. It's also tense when necessary, especially the scenes of the farmers hunting Mr. Fox. Also, the humor is really funny. Favorite scenes of mine include the master plan, and even Bean going on a rampage after learning Mr. Fox and company took everything.And lastly, the music. Alexandre Desplat scored this movie fabulously. His bucolic, banjo-driven score perfectly fits the tone the movie is going for, and matches the rustic setting perfectly. In addition, the movie showcases an eclectic mix of really great songs that fit every scene they appear in. Those include three incredible Beach Boys songs that I have fond memories of as a kid (those being ""Heroes and Villains"", ""I Get Around"" and ""Old Man River"") that are all used perfectly, ""Street-Fighting Man"" by the Rolling Stones for the scene of the farmers uprooting Mr. Fox's tree with excavators, and even ""Let Her Dance"" by the Bobby Fuller Four by the ending, not to mention a bunch of old-timey country songs. There's also the little playground children's song about the farmers, that's really catchy.Everything considered, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a pleasant and fun family movie, and one of the best movies Wes Anderson has ever made. It's got fantastic characters, a fantastic script, fantastic animation, and fantastic music. All around, it's a fantastic movie. Highly recommended!!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Charming film that is so wonderfully weird,"Mr. Fox is living a very middle class suburban life as a newspaper columnist with his wife and son, Ashe. Years before he had been a wily predator, but a near death experience when caught in a trap has him promising Mrs. Fox that if he gets out of this mess alive he will give up hunting.But now Mr. Fox feels restless. He thinks he can settle that restlessness by moving his family out of the hole in the ground that they live in and into a tree. But all that does is expose the real hunger inside of him - his desire to hunt and kill birds. He plans a raid on the farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. His raids are a success, but the farmers are not going to be satisfied until Mr. Fox and his family are dead, along with lots of the other animals in the area that may get killed as the three farmers stop at nothing to dig and starve Mr. Fox's family out.In a parallel story, Mrs. Fox's nephew, Kristofferson, has come for an extended visit. He's the same age as Ashe, thus they are in the same grade at school, and Kristofferson is better at everything than Ashe is - a better athlete, better student, better with the girls. And worst of all he seems to have his dad's admiration over Ashe's. As a result, Ashe acts out passive aggressively.So you have this nice little world with animals that parallels that of humans, with animals dressing and behaving as humans, with human professions like beavers who are attorneys, a possum maintenance man, a fox journalist and his wife, a painter of landscapes. Yet, at the end of the day, Mr. Fox makes them remember that they are all wild animals. It was why he would risk it all to kill a few chickens and be true to his nature rather than remain safe and bored as a newspaper columnist.And just one more thing - One of the farmers kept a ""chronically rabid"" dog as a guard dog. What would be the purpose of such a beast, as it is not just a hazard to your enemies, it's a hazard to anybody. Was that a kind of dig at nuclear weapons? I wonder.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fan4stic Mr. Fox,"Fantastic Mr. Fox takes you on an emotional journey through the struggles of adulthood, as well as the frustrations of adolescence. Balancing the two within a familial dynamic, this has plenty of heart and passion. Playing it a bit safe, I wish they dove deeper into the issues covered, only to give the story some more emotional connection, but that doesn't take away from the story given. The stop-motion is remarkable and flows so seamlessly that you lose yourself in the film and forget that puppetry that goes into it. The cast feel as though they are their characters and their voices perfectly embody each one in their own special way. Though I wish there was more to it, Wes Anderson crafts a delightfully whimsical tale, with uniquely unforgettable visuals and stellar performances by the entire cast.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Anderson is in the hen house,"A fox has gotta stay true to being a fox. That's the point of director Wes Anderson's (The Royal Tennenbaums) simplistic, yet entertaining first foray into animation. With ""Coraline"", ""Up"", and now ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", that ""Best animated Feature"" Oscar race is heating up. Based on the children's book by Roald Dahl, Fox (voice with sly charm by George Clooney) promises his wife (Meryl Streep) that he'll quit his thieving ways and settle down with a less dangerous job in order to support his fast-growing family. 2 years later (12 in fox years), Fox is a newspaper man living with his wife and young son named Ash (Jason Schwartzman), who is eager to please his father and jealous of his taller and much more talented visiting-cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson). Except something just isn't right. Fox needs that thrill of catching chickens and so along with his opossum buddy Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky), he sets out to steal from three of the meanest land-owners in the area, Boggis, Bunce, and the soon to be leader of the three who sets out to kill Fox, Bean (Michael Gambon). Soon Fox realizes that he's not only put the lives of his family at risk, but all the other animals as well. The stop motion animation is amazing; the bright-orangey scenery, fluidly quick character movements, and their outstanding creation are all marvelously done. Anderson has also found a good medium for his quirky sense of humor, especially in a hilarious description of a convoluted baseball/cricket-type game and an on-going gag about Kylie's eyes. George Clooney leads the way in voice casting but the all-star cast does nice work as well, Gambon playing a perfectly gruff antagonist, Schwartzman as the attention-seeking son, and Willem Dafoe very funny as a Louisiana rat. Streep, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, and Brian Cox also show up but have less to do. ""Fox"" is a little less than fantastic, but it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Totally Feels Like an Animated Ocean's Movie,"GreatThe animation is absolutely superb. With some of the best stop motion work I have ever seen. The aesthetic of the entire film is absolutely beautiful and the story is one that both children and adults can enjoy.It made me laugh a lot, I was surprised how funny the movie actually was, I don't think I have ever seen it all the way through until now. I loved Isle of Dogs so I knew I would like this one. This film really does have a lot of heart. The voice actors were brilliantly cast and really enhanced the film. And the music was amazing! The soundtrack really stood out to me.Overall, I thought Fantastic, Mr. Fox was a great film. The story was well written and fun to watch. The film was absolutely breathtaking from the start, with it's aesthetic being beautiful throughout the entirety. And it has a lot of rewatachability. The ending doesn't necessarily feel happy but it isn't exactly bad either. So not sure how I felt about that. Otherwise, great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"For its style and verve, ten stars plus. For a story line, it could have had more depth","Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)I never would have seen this movie, I think, if it wasn't for ""Moonrise Kingdom"" which I totally adored. Directed by the same man, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a kind of animated or claymation production with famous actors doing the voices, like ""Where the Wild Things Are"" or the more animated Pixar and Disney movies.It's not really quite for children, however. Director Wes Anderson has shown in both movies a sensibility unique in movies. These aren't just a kids cartoon movies with adult overtones (undertones?). But they aren't the sardonic and ironic adult fare sometimes seen in animation, keeping all through a sense of playfulness and innocence. Both movies are consistent, incredibly well designed and filmed, and warm without being sickly sweet.But my own preference is for the more recent Moonrise Kingdom because that movie used real actors, and had a wilder sense of exploration of the scenery with the camera. There will be equal numbers who prefer ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" for exactly the opposite reasons--it's all invented and original, going not only across fun mid-America landscapes but going underground, too. It's endlessly fun. There are villains and heroes. There is a clear sense of right and wrong, of love and even of some kind of character development.There isn't, for my taste, enough of what you just call plot. Things happen, and it progresses, of course. But it's nothing much to chew on, just further and further escapades escaping the baddies. Fun, yes, but it actually gets tiring, too. When this happens you turn to the set design and the general style, which is worth watching for its own sake. But I still wish there was more. (An example further out-- the first ""Monsters Inc."" is non-stop interesting and inventive. That's a high standard, but hey.)The voices here are big names (like George Clooney) but maybe they don't matter so much. It's not like their character, as a human actor, is embedded in the character, at least not much. (This is done more clearly in ""Polar Express"" where Tom Hanks is kind of evident all along.)Yeah, enjoy the heck out of this. And you really can let your kids watch it--they'll likely love it. And you might, too.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Too adult for kids, to smug for adults, and not even close to Roald Dahl","I wanted to like this film. I love animation, whether its the flashiest CGI or the simplest stop-motion, and I love Roald Dahl. I like witty, quirky unexpected humour and I don't get into a spin when a book adaptation does just that - adapts a story for the screen. The cast list looked terrific. What could I lose?First I lost hope; then I lost interest. The trouble with this film was that it was trying to be a witty and stylish adult heist-film within a child's storybook - but there was never enough sense of threat to make that work. But they didn't stop there: a touch of spagetti-western with the showdown with a texan rat actually got me interested for the whole 3 minutes before they dropped back to the boring main threads. They squidged in a disaffected teen buddy story, with the jealous, overlooked son and his perfect cousin - unconvincing, tiresome, solved by the son suddenly becoming athletic and brilliant under fire for no reason. They made a stab at a dash or romance Mrs Fox the fiesty wife who lets him away with it anyway. Couldn't find enough clichés?The Americanisation of the story wouldn't bother me at all if it was complete and wholehearted instead of half-baked. Why were the villains, in this rural American landscape, English? Why did Jarvis Cocker turn up singing bluegrass? Why did the helicopter spotter Australian? These things are so absurd they almost sound funny, but in the event they just seemed stupid and unconvincing.The adult humour came over as smug and self-indulgent - very different from Dahl's odd, daring and absurd charm. ""Based on"" is overstating it - they kept the 3 villains, a rat and Mr/Mrs Fox: most other things were changed. The one element from Dahl's story, which was published 1970, that they did not change was the gender balance. Hard to imagine a wildlife community with a male/female ratio of 9:1 lasting. Oh, and the females were 1. the wife/mother and 2. the possible love interest for the cousin (so the son could be jealous). No, no hold on... a villain's wife appeared briefly twice...I did like the animation - the strange layers, the funny digging scenes, the narrow and tall thing. But it didn't make up for a muddled plot, no likeable characters, a tiresomely smug script. No joy and no surprises.This film was selected by my youngest kid but the kids watched it pretty well in silence and said it was... ""Mmm. Okay"" That says it all really. Disappointing.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Some reviewers here said it muddles the expression of emotion, but that's exactly what I find so endearing.

I relate so much to ash that I feel comfort being able to watch a film and finding someone who understands what it's like to be ""different"". I think to some this would be a fun colourful movie filled with whimsical and catchy music but to a few who understand will find this movie to be one of the best they have ever watched and being able to find their character to relate to.

Not my favorite, but not my least favorite... and even his lesser films are still more fun than most of the things that get made these days.The cast is exceptional, but it is Anderson's sensibility that really sells this one.

You'll be surprised!,"When I rented ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"", I was pretty much expecting another cutesy rodent flick that I could fall asleep too. I was in for a shocker. Written and directed by Wes Anderson, this movie is obviously quirky, but not in an unsettling way. It is very witty and I found its sense of humor refreshing for an animated film. It doesn't have to be vile, but has a very adult humor to it. There are many child-friendly replacements such as ""the disloyal lab partner"" and ""what the cuss"" and ""beagle ticks"". It was clever, but didn't run completely on shock value. I admire that in a script. George Clooney and Meryl Streep obviously do a great job with the voice acting, but I was surprised that Streep had a relatively secondary role. The characters are very easy to relate too. (And yes, I know they're animals). Ash is the awkward son who is trying to find his place in the world. His jealousy of his ""perfect"" cousin, Kristofferson, provides a good B-storyline. Mr. Fox is the former-thief who doesn't like the concept of settling down. His wife (who I originally thought was the tragic, stereotypical housewife) can still kick butt. This is one of those movies you have to watch twice before you can warm up to it, but it's definitely worth it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Weird Mr. Fox,"I'll give credit where credit is due, the animation is eccentric, wacky and nifty, not to mention all the weird camera angles applied. The screenplay is...not so eccentric. Some scenes aside, this is a very dry story, not terribly colourful in performance, and lacking in old fashioned humour. I'm interested to see what kinds of films Wes Andersson grew up on that could inspire such oddities like Fanastic Mr. FoxI don't even wanna begin to describe the story. Now the last time I read Fantastic Mr. Fox was when I was Ten years ago, but I do remember it being fairly coherent, much less convoluted than this story. Well convoluted isn't the word, lets just say, The rhythm is unusual as is the dialogue for that matter. Further more, there seems to be quite a lack of it, These critters don't really have a whole lot of productive things to say to each other, sometimes it feels like dialogue for the sake of dialogue.The Music ques are kind of catchy, that's what I remember best about Fantastic Mr. Fox. The banjo in particular is not a commonly used instrument, but it's the star of the orchestra in this movie Fantastic Mr. Fox has it's ups and downs, I wouldn't recommend it as a family feature, but movie goers may get a kick out of its eccentric charm.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Somewhat Fantastic Mr. Fox,"This film is a good film, but I wouldn't be doing other reviews justice by giving this anything higher than 6. I'm a sucker for a Wes Anderson film, and he certainly delivers on the amazing stop-motion and beautiful scenery. But, as per my other reviews, I rate a film based on bathroom breaks, and phone checks.

Don't get me wrong, it had it's great moments, but the dull times unfortunately outshine them.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Let's cut the cuss, one cussing good movie","Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of those films that just makes you smile.Newspaper man Mr. Fox is out to feed his family. Not because he is hungry but simply because he is a wild animal. Wes Anderson's Roald Dahl adaptation is joyous, charming and out right hilarious. There really isn't anything out there to compete with it for your dollars right now.I made it my mission in elementary school to read every one of Roald Dahl's books. Having read Fantastic Mr. Fox twenty some years ago, I still had a fuzzy idea of the story. The film follows the original quite well. Anderson has expanded the narrative in ways that not only fit his style, but the added character dimensions fit the story perfectly.The stop-motion animation is a great way for a story like this to be shared with an audience. Computer animation gets better and better every year, but Fantastic Mr. Fox shows there is life left in the hand made process still.George Cloony has a mischievous luster in the title role opposite Meryl Streep's quiet confidence of his wife. While Bill Murray's Badger and Willem Dafoe's Weasel turn in well honed supporting voices, it is Wallace Wolodarsky's Opossum Kylie who steals the show. I laughed at nearly every one of his lines.After several half measures and missteps since Royal Tenenbaums (itself a movie that was either obnoxious or brilliant) Wes Anderson has directed something truly great.Fantastic Mr. Fox is a cuss of a good time.

Wes tries Children's flicks,"An irrefutable giant in children's novels, Wes Anderson lifts one of Dahl's works and gives it a modern retelling. Copious amounts of dry humor constitutes the bulk of the screenplay. Like the narrative's pacing, it arrives with reckless abandon and goes full steam ahead. This does not however amount to the whole thing crashing and burning. Instead, there's a brilliant and controlled chaos to Anderson's lightning fast creative command.The characters all have distinct personalities, and borrow proper depth through (once again) the superb screenplay. The slightly jerky stop motion contains much care and due diligence, and brings in some extra quirk. Settings? Very diverse and detailed, the urban environments especially.Other sections deserving of praise is the lore it leaves. It conveys a genuine sense of a universe that operates on its own, consistent rules. More minor maybe but it makes it all more palatable and relatable to viewers. Justly one of the best children's films you'll encounter outside Ghibli and Pixar. Fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A different story in a pretty movie,"This is a very entertaining animation. The story is not politically correct: it teaches children to follow their will and talents, even if that means being a good burglar. But it also teaches good things: to accept oneself; to do your best; to unite to get stronger, and work as a team, among other things.The film goes on a good pace, it has a lot of action. Many things happen, keeping your attention. It gives the impression of being a long movie, but not because it's bad. I felt like my spent time was worth it. The different things that happen are well linked, and they go according to the characters' personality. As a fable, it works great - most fables do; and the characters are amusing.This movie also gets extra points from me due to its originality. It represents people, in a way that it contains different, sometimes conflicting elements found in most people.There are a few unnecessary scene, but they don't make this movie less fun. And a few technical elements are poor also, but one must admit that some things must be really hard to do in stop-motion. In fact, the creators did have a good amount of creativity in some scenes. Finally, I can't leave behind any comments on the graphical quality of the movie. It has some really beautiful images, and most of the others are at least very nice.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
What's wrong with the original story?,"I enjoyed this film, having read the book several times with my children I was obviously looking forward to seeing it on the big screen. I liked Clooney's voice and the style of animation but I can never work out why the film makers feel the need to change anything in a straight forward classic tale (no pun intended). For example making his home a tree house made the whole point of the farmers stakeout, waiting for him to leave his hole pointless! Why didn't the story stick to the tunnel digging and final feast for the animals? I can understand cutting things out when there is just too much to include in a film but changing bits and ignoring a perfect end to the story was a big let down. Maybe you just have to accept that books are always better than the film adaptation but this is a relatively short and concise story, probably one of the best children's stories and I just can't see why anyone would see the need to rewrite it?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The first thing that I noticed was how idiotic Foxy was and if I were his wife, he'd be seeing the flat side of a cast iron frying pan to his head. The foxes talked mechanically, especially the wife, like they were discussing medical theories in a library, instead of feeling the real emotion the scene would have caused.

Anderson's quirks help change the face of stop-motion animation,"There really is something a bit fantastic about Wes Anderson's stop-motion animation debut ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" The quirky spirit of the Roald Dahl book could only be captured by a filmmaker with a deep and unforgiving wit. Anderson's dry and subtle sense of humor might not translate into big dollars (at least by comparison to giants such as DreamWorks and Pixar), but his affinity for diverse and amusing characters fits the world of animation better than anyone might expect.Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a cocky yet certainly charming woodland creature who relocates his family to an area where three nasty and powerful farmers named Boggis, Bunce and Bean live nearby. A former chicken thief, Mr. Fox sees a chance to recapture some of his former glory, even if it means going behind the back of his loyal wife (Meryl Streep). When the farmers catch onto him, they go after his home and family.Snagging your attention from the get-go is the unique quality of the stop-motion figures. Anderson explores the medium's full potential, blending elements of the modern day detail- oriented school of thought with cartoon elements and also playing with the 2-D diorama aspect which is unlike anything done before. Stop-motion masters such as Nick Park are all focuses on making the world seem as real as possible whereas Anderson isn't afraid to make his characters look and feel like moving figurines. He embraces that quality in a way most filmmakers would likely be afraid to do.The details on the close-ups of Mr. Fox and friends are stunning. I can't recall any stop- motion characters that looked so good inches away from the camera. The fur and the way the eyes roll around in the sockets are two unparalleled qualities.Anderson's dry humor lends itself excellently to the family film, which fans of his work probably did not expect, but probably should have. His films have always been focused on family. Tone down the family members to PG levels and the extent to which they are dysfunction and you have an excellent director for such a film. ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" would not top any kid's list of family/kid movies, but there's no issues of child-appropriateness. Some physical humor accompanied with the dead-pan wit of of Anderson and his usual suspects (Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, etc) achieve the child vs. parent-geared balance most animated films strive for.Then again, adults will appreciate ""Mr. Fox"" a whole lot more. Animation has proved itself a viable means of adult entertainment in 2009 with ""Mr. Fox"" capping it all off. The film will make you laugh in ways you never thought an animated film with talking animals ever could because of how ingeniously understated all the gags are.But ""Mr. Fox"" is equal parts art, taking stop-motion to new places. The opening sequences of Mr. and Mrs. running through a farm and stealing chickens serves as an ideal taste of what's to come. The camera pulls back and you see the set as if you were one of the filmmakers looking at these miniature models and the two are running around and jumping to some classic-as-always soundtrack choices from Anderson. It is a unique and spirited adventure that despite a somewhat disinteresting plot breaks ground in enough special ways to warrant some serious acclaim.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

brilliant adaptation of a classic story,"I made a conscious decision not to see Fantastic Mr. Fox at the cinema having seen the trailers and thought I wouldn't quite like the style of animation and therefore would not enjoy this, how I was wrong.Mr. Fox (George Clooney) is having trouble settling down to family life after his life of chicken stealing, but when he moves in to his new tree, he finds three villainous farmers as his new neighbours he gets drawn back in for one last job.The stop motion animation works perfectly for this with director Wes Anderson purposely using a slower frame rate to film it in so as your attention is not drawn away from the animation artwork. The tone of the film is excellent mixing humor, and it is quite a funny film, with heartfelt sentiment of a much loved children's book.There were influences of the directors other films, most notably The Royal Tenembuams with the dysfunctional family and Mr Fox's struggle to find common ground with his son Ash (Jason Swartzman). Watch out for former Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker's cameo halfway through with a brilliant musical highlight, I also thought the use of blueberries to take out guard dogs was particularly in genius.An animation of a children's book this may be but I cannot see a child taking any thing from this as it is largely an adult affair.

Best Stop-Motion Film I've Ever Seen,"Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is just a simple fox trying to make his way in the world. For him, stealing chickens is the quickest and easiest way to make a living. The chicken theft life caught up with him one day while he was on a caper with his wife Mrs. Fox (voiced by Meryl Streep). It was then that he promised to give up the chicken stealing game.Mr. Fox couldn't quite hold on to that promise. A couple of years later he was back at it again with his friend Kylie (voiced by Wallace Wolodarsky) and even his nephew Kristofferson (voiced by Eric Chase Anderson).""Mr. Fox"" is dry and subdued, but so very funny and entertaining. Though it's done in stop motion puppet animation, it will go over the heads of kids. The deadpan humor, particularly from Ash (voiced by Jason Schwartzman), Mr. Fox's son, was on point. Likewise, Badger (voiced by Bill Murray), Mr. Fox's attorney, chipped in with his own brand of comedy. I don't think I've seen a stop motion animation I've liked as much except if you count a few clips from ""Robot Chickin.""",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A lot of weaknesses, but it's pleasant and kind of beautiful at times","Wes Anderson becomes an animation director while retaining his signature visual style. The stop-motion animation itself is intentionally crude and old fashioned, almost like an episode of Gumby, and it has a charm. One wonders whether the younger generation will accept it or not. Some kids in the theater behind me certainly didn't, and were fidgeting throughout the movie. That may not have just been due to the animation style, though, as it's not really aimed for kids so much as Wes Anderson fans. Based on the book by Roald Dahl but presumably barely resembling it, George Clooney voices Mr. Fox, a former bird thief forced to give it up by his wife (Meryl Streep) after they are nearly captured. Twelve years later and saddled by a son (Jason Schwartzman) and a new mortgage, Mr. Fox decides that he's had enough of the safe life and decides to pilfer from three nearby and very dangerous farmers. In retaliation, the farmers attack the entire animal community in the forest where Mr. Fox lives. I haven't read the Dahl book, but most of Fantastic Mr. Fox's best moments are definitely Wes Anderson moments, with perfectly chosen music and semi-awkward dialogue and petty character conflict. The plot of the film is really not Anderson's interest, which does lead to problems later in the film. As a children's story, Fantastic Mr. Fox at least in part relies on action, and Anderson is just not an action director. His set-ups are confusing and often make little sense. As the film goes through its climax, it gets considerably weaker than when the characters were just standing around conversing. All in all, it's far from a great movie, and perhaps in reality it isn't even that good of one. But there is a lot of beauty in it, and I love the handcrafted feel. I'd marginally recommend it, though I'd say you have to at least in part be a fan of Wes Anderson.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
My kid wanted to leave,"The film is good but for me would have made a much better 1 hour special. I like kids films and I did not really enjoy this. I think it is more aimed at adults who want to regress to childhood rather than for children themselves. For me the music did not work in a children's film. The set music pieces did not work, the choreography was a little stilted. The rat knife fight was a little more vicious and aggressive than is necessary in a children's film.The last few years as the US is going from bad to worse war, financial collapse, vicious political divides they seem to be wanting cinema that is not representative of the rest of the world. UP is an example of a film not really for children but childlike adults. Slumdog Millionaire got an Oscar for best film. While it is a good film I think it is more reflective of the US audience wanting to feel good and needing films that are innocent and simple.Like I said my child wanted to the leave the cinema after 45 minutes and I was not to sad to go.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Wonderful work by the team coordinated by Anderson, but Anderson is best with live action","Anybody can tell you that an animated film written by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach and directed by Mr. Anderson will be more about family rivalries and quirky characters than about cute animals, despite Fantastic Mr. Fox's basis in a famous Roald Dahl children's tale that's been called ""great for reading aloud to three- to seven-year-olds."" Dahl was a Brit, and much of this production is English. But it's a hybrid of Yank and UK elements, with the animals, headed by George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as his wife, with Anderson regulars like Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Angelika Huston, and Adrien Brody, are a star-studded and somewhat cultish American voice crew. The animals outwit three despicable farmers and steal their livestock for food. These agricultural baddies, described by Dahl as ""Boggis and Bunce and Bean/One fat, one short, one lean./These horrible crooks/So different in looks/Were nonetheless equally mean,"" are not only humans, but in the film contrast in all being played by Brits. Mr. Fox premiered as the gala opening night film at the London Film Festival, with Mr. Clooney on hand to add glamor. Media reaction was positive, though privately some English viewers were less pleased with the ""Americaniation"" of the material.The stop-motion animation using stuffed dolls -- especially with Anderson's reliance on extreme closeups -- may result in the foxes and other critters appearing seedy at times, but the process is executed so slickly and photographed so brightly (with heavy emphasis on orangey earth colors) that the contrast with more hi tech pixilations and computerizations may not be so great to the untutored eye as some think. More serous for the kid audience is, well, how serious the material is, as well as more complicated, in this enlarged version of the Roald Dahl story. Take the quote offered by IMDb:Mr. Fox: (sighs) Who am I, Kylie?Kylie: Who how? What now?Mr. Fox: Why a fox? Why not a horse, or a beetle, or a bald eagle? I'm saying this more as, like, existentialism, you know? Who am I? And how can a fox ever be happy without, you'll forgive the expression, a chicken in its teeth?Kylie: I don't know what you're talking about, but it sounds illegal.Not very funny, and right over the heads of the seven-year-olds; but still, pretty cool stuff for an animated children's tale. Fox (one wants to say Clooney, so ably does he insinuate himself into the role) is often referring to the fact that they are finally just ""wild animals."" And the film is most captivating when the various creatures eat -- explosively devouring a pile of food and leaving crushed fragments -- or burrow into the ground -- again with explosive, instinctive animality. One wishes these hints of the savage creature inside the talking animated model came more often, and more surprisingly. These are places where 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' feels truly original.It might have been nice if the film hadn't gotten so elaborately caught up in the grand war campaign between Fox and his friends (no, there's no Fassbinder in here) and the three agri-business meanies (that's what they almost become in the film) played by Robin Hurlstone (Boggis), Hugo Guinness (Bunce) and Michael Gambon (Beane). Though some British viewers have chafed at this, the intimate dysfunctionality (so typical of the maker of 'The Royal Tennenbaums,' 'The Life Aquatic' and 'The Darjeeling Limited') provides the best stuff, the moments when the dialog sparkles and charms and makes you think. The script is so subtle, even with stuffed animals, at nuancing the conflicts between Fox and his wife; at conveying their son Ash's (Schwartzman's) insecurities and his rivalries with the too-talented visiting cousin, Kristofersson (Eric Chase Anderson), that you may wish the film focused more on the intimate stuff. As with Anderson's other movies, it's character, not action, that matters. So you kind of wonder why there is so much action. Nonetheless there are action sequences that work very well, which is perhaps where the animators come in, the vast Visual Effects crew, and cinematographer Tristan Oliver -- who seem to have had a life of their own and partly had to fend for themselves in London, with Anderson directing things from a distance, via e-mail, from his Paris apartment. But if the direction was phoned-in, it seems to have worked pretty cussing well (an oddity of the script is its substituting the word ""cus"" where a stronger swear word, including the F-one, is meant). 'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is an animated feature that's both sophisticated and winning. Those (including a couple of name New York reviewers) who say this is Anderson's best movie yet, however, may just not like his other movies that much. Wes does wonderful work here with the voices of Clooney, Streep, Schwartzman, Wilson, and the rest, and he's shown he can coordinate a great animation team. But he does even better work as an auteur when he gets to put human bodies as well as voices on the screen. Still, this is the year's smartest and most winning animated feature.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cluster Cuss of Wild Animals,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes being creative and clever just isn't enough. Writer/director Wes Anderson has a track record of extremely creative projects. Some work very well (Royal Tenenbaums, Rushmore) while others fall just short of the mark (Life Aquatic, Darjeeling Limited). When Mr. Anderson hooks up with writer Noah Baumbach (Squid and the Whale) to take on a Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) story, a movie lover can't help but get very excited!The look of the film is very unusual and ""fantastic"" in its own right. The fur or coats of the animals is pretty amazing and even the expressive faces are new to the big screen. What really fell short for me was the voice acting of some very impressive folks. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray all fall a bit flat and just play it too cool ... dare I say it ... they were all a bit boring! Willem Dafoe as the rat was really the only one who brought any life to his role.So while I absolutely love the look of the film and the characters, I was quite disappointed in the pace and passion of the story and the manner in which it's acted. It is probably too slow for both kids and adults, so I am not sure who the audience will be ... other than film technicians who will appreciate the look.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unbelivebly BAD,"There is mania currently for Hollywood movies that are different. Because everything became so mundane, Hollywood is in crises... and as a result of that, you get movie like this, overrated with bunch of rewards.First do yourself a favor and go watch the trailer. You must be sure that you can bear that awful 40's like animation 'till the end. Old movies with plasticine figurines had smoother moves than characters in this movie. Animation is bad, but thats OK because they are retro. The Artist is also retro black and white, silent movie, but it had a GREAT story.Fantastic Mr. Fox is based by the book, but I think story is hijacked from thin picture book for children. Very shallow. Plus bad animation and no chance for good acting. Voice acting is not very demanding.I thought that will give me some laughs, but not at all... maybe 2-3 for the whole movie. Plus there are those face closeups that were just annoying.I give it a strong 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Great Cussing Film,"Anderson's overall approach to filmmaking can be a little bit artificial. His live action stuff is often too self-conscious and twee for its own good. Yet in animation this slightly stilted quality of tone and excessive concern with details really fits. This is one of the few films of his that I have found myself swept up in. It is a crackerjack of a film that has all the components of a hit for families. It has plenty of adult humor that is sure to go over kids' heads; it has some fairly adult themes about dealing with a midlife crisis. Above all the film has a great, great sense of moment, space and visual scope. The animation is wonderful. And it is just so Anderson.Fans of the Dahl book might be annoyed. The adaptation is fairly loose. The film expands both the beginning and the end of the tale. Further, the tone of the story doesn't quite have the subversive edge that Dahl's work does. I read the book as a kid and this isn't quite what I thought the film would be. Anderson's personality comes through more than Dahl's.Clooney is really engaging as Mr. Fox. This was good fit between director, source material and lead actor.And I love the cussing in the film!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Absolutely Amazing. Best movie in a long time, Animated or Otherwise.","Fantastic Mr. Fox is about a fox who must give up the bird stealing business to get a regular daytime job. After he's settled down with another fox and started a family he becomes bored with his life and decides to go back to stealing birds for one last big job.I don't know if I have any real complaints about Fantastic Mr. Fox.The visuals are some of the best I have ever seen. Every single scene of Fantastic Mr. Fox is an absolute feast for the eyes. All the little sets are amazingly well designed and there are so many little things to notice. I watched Fantastic Mr. Fox at least 5 times and every time I'll notice one or two more things that I didn't notice before. The camera work is just a wonder to behold as well. Wes Anderson manages to get right down in the middle of these sets were most stop motion movies don't get. Also, many zooms and face shots are used for the characters which most stop motion movies steer clear of.The script is amazing as well. So many clever lines and jokes are interspersed throughout the dialog. Also, there are many clever analogies and points made about society and human/animal nature. Having animals behave like humans can't help but make the viewer think about how like animals humans really are when you come right down to it.Every character in Fantastic Mr. Fox is interesting and amazingly well voice acted. All the actors manage to breath so much life into these characters that they become real in your mind. George Clooney and Jason Schwartzman are particularly brilliant as is their father-son dynamic in the film.I truly have nothing bad to say about this movie and I believe that everyone should see it. I also believe that it far surpasses many of the overrated animated movies of the last few years (Ratatouille, Up, etc.)Sorry Hurt Locker, this is the Best Movie of 2009.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Wes Anderson's Perfect Transition to the Mainstream, and You Know They Need Him There","Fantastic Mr. Fox is technically one of the very best films ever created. That may sound like an overstatement, but only to those who overlook the few filmmakers out there who are actually advancing the art, the way an art is supposed to be advanced. Wes Anderson is one of those filmmakers, and you can't study film without seeing that his clear, playacting style of film is completely original and making waves in dozens, if not hundreds of young directors. There's a reason why Scorcese called Wes Anderson ""the new Scorsese""- being about the biggest compliment Scorcese could give. But up until now, the cause for this compliment has only been demonstrated in a small set of perfectly crafted adult comedies like ""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tennenbaums"", and ""The Darjeeling Limited"".Well, at last Wes Anderson has created something that we can all watch together. But what's cooler is that the decision on Mr. Anderson's part to make something for General Audinces doesn't appear at all to be based on caring about that at all, let alone having some Dreamworks-esquire Disney-envy; but upon the fact that– like Walt Disney– Wes Anderson simply has a genuine appreciation of Aesopic storytelling, and is extraordinarily good at both it, and animation. In fact, no one has added as much to the canon on how humanized animals could behave since Disney himself (note Anderson's animals' sudden bursts of raw animalistic behavior when eating and fighting, which serves hilariously to both animalize the characters more, and even build their strengths– while simultaneously satirizing certain human behaviors that can often be, humorously animalistic themselves).In fact it looks as though all can be glad because– as you'll see a lot of critics saying– if there's anyone who could give Disney a run for their incalculable money, it's Anderson. We're all impressed by Disney– that's why I always hope they have someone keeping them on their toes. But again, taking down Disney does not seem to be one of Anderson's motivations at all. Again, it's his natural, evident love for what he's done here with Fantastic Mr. Fox that makes Mr. Anderson the most likely person to succeed, however incidentally, at creating the next major animation studio with it's own thing going. And he should do exactly that, between live action films.When successful, center-buzz art-film directors like Wes Anderson get all the more artsy, with full-on stop-motion animation (which, once you quickly get past the initial movement of it with the help of some excellent storytelling, can look more real than the best cgi– because you can feel that it IS real) and the result is mainstream fare, however intentionally limited it's release, I feel like falling over with joy. And how impressive is it that a feature-length, stop-motion animation film– which, being more foreign now, requires stronger storytelling to suspend the audience's disbelief– works as well as a Pixar film; and what does that say about Wes Anderson's storytelling ability?Now, about the film– I love it when people think that animation is just for kids, so I will tell you that this is more of a family film than a kid's movie; and I'm saying that because everyone will enjoy this film more if they know what they're getting into– i.e. adults should know and not just be surprised by the fact that they are probably the film's intended core audience– because that's cool here. Looney Tunes were the same way. For example, with Mr. Fox, all of the dialogue is very proper and intelligent, and many, many of the situational and subtle humor will be less grappled by kids. It is not, however, dirty. It also involves a hilariously satirical depiction of the use of swearing, wherein the characters will begin to say sentences that overuse the word ""cuss"", in places where there would normally be even some of the spiciest language, in reality. That being said, I don't know how that can hurt kids any more than public school. And when it comes to how even little children will enjoy what really is advanced entertainment, it's still a bunch of talking animals. They freaking love it.So while this new style of animating may in a very real way compete with the best, it will do so because it's really nothing like it, especially when compared to how close the other competitors all are to each other. This is not Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, or A bug's Life, or something in between– because in spite of the fact that the characters are a bunch of talking animals, it's still– in every other way– very different than other cartoons. And if it's slightly more mature than the rest, that's because it's a Wes Anderson take on a Roald Dahl story– and both are noted for mischief, high invention, and the flavour of England.And Fantastic Mr. Fox, while being a reminder of Wes Anderson's unparalleled auteurism– which includes his firm grasp on Art Direction, Direction, Writing, Story, Costuming, Music, and about twenty other key elements in film– is, perhaps first and foremost, a quintessential reminder of just how truly, truly funny he can be. He's one of the world's greatest humorist, and we wouldn't believe it because we're living in his time. When you really stop and analyze it– all of his trademarks are chosen because of their specific power to accentuate or produce humor– the only exception being that which he implements for the accentuation or production of pure, good, old-fashioned tomfoolery. And if the latter is not for the kids, then nothing is.I love Wes Anderson's films, and in a very thought-through kind of way, I think that Fantastic Mr. Fox might just be his best one. That is saying about as much about this film as I can say. It's absolutely perfect, and I hope Anderson takes us on this kind of outing again and often.Bravo, Wes Anderson. You rule.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just alright,"There is no doubt that Wes Anderson's stop motion adaptation of Roald Dahl's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is more than on point visually. Yet, the artsy and sophisticated production design doesn't make up for the inconsistency in tone. The offbeat comedy and clever dialogues could be a little too much for a child to handle, yet the themes introduced and reflections made are not stimulating enough for an adult audience. It might not be a life-changing experience, but it surely guarantees 87 minutes of light-hearted divertissement.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A good movie, a terrible adaptation","I wanted to love this, I really did. I heard it was a masterpiece, a fresh and unique movie unlike anything else. And I can still see why people like it so much. But as a guy who's read the book about 15 times and for whom it remains an integral part of their childhood, I just didn't quite catch on. Don't get me wrong, the animation is magnificent, the music is solid and the comedy is mostly fine. The emotional moments also work to an extent, but I wasn't super invested.I think the entire thing boils down to how much have changed for the book. You see, what I love about the book is the simplistic joy it brings, the terror of the family trying to escape, followed by the heartwarming adventures as they invade the farms. But in the movie, the animals are treated as humans: They have human jobs, live in humanlike homes and do human stuff. In my mind, the main reason for having humans and other equally intelligent beings coexist is to showcase how other species interact with humans, like in Toy Story. But here, the fact that they're animals doesn't really drive the conflict, nor does it change the way they're viewed by the humans. It's a shame, because I could so perfectly picture the story as told in the book, on the screen, there's some really solid potential there.It might seem like I'm only complaining, and yeah, I kinda am, but I really wanted this to click with me, and the disappoinment I felt, while not enough to ruin the movie, still left somewhat of a bad taste in my mouth. Maybe I'll rewatch this some day and realize what a masterpiece it is, but for now, I'm just left wishing that we'd got a movie faithful adaptation, or that I wasn't such a petty, nostalgia-blind fool, one of the two.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic Mr. Fox,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, Wes Anderson has created a wonderful and whimsical world with great characters and an amazing story.

The use of Claymation is amazing and makes the film look great.The voice is good. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Wallace Wolodarsky, Eric Chase Anderson, Owen Wilson, and many more all do a great job.The pacing is usually good. The film starts off fast but slows down in the middle. The runtime is short and sweet.Pro: Whimsical world with great characters, genuine story, good voice acting, fast pacing, and a short runtimeCons: Some slow pacing in the middle of the filmOverall Rating: 9.0P.S. This children's film is a gem and must be seen. It is in the ranks of Inside Out, Toy Story, Up, Zootopia, and Spirited Away.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Boring,"I started watching this movie with the best intentions. I actually like many of the voice actors, and have heard good things about the director. Talk about life setting me up for a fall. It started with what I thought to be an opening sequence with some weird drawing-like images of a farm and some ugly lifeless foxes pasted on top of it, moving along with all the fluency of a powerpoint presentation. Soon enough I would find out that the entire movie would be in this style.If I were to sum the entire experience up in a word it would be boring. That pretty much says it all. The animation (though probably brilliantly done, and very artsy) just doesn't deliver. The characters look lifeless and at times even scary. This is probably partially due to the facial expressions of the characters, or rather, lack thereof. They aren't nearly sophisticated enough to put the emotions of the story across. The ''action'' scenes are anything but. The slow, boring, and unrealistic stop motion animation makes it virtually impossible to feel any sort of suspense regardless of what's going on in the movie.All of this could be forgiven if the story would be any good (and suited for this type of animation), but alas. The story is weird, long-winded, unengaging, but most of all; boring. I remember reading the book as a child, and loving it. I wish I could say the same for this screen adaptation. I don't really remember the entire story in the original book, but I'm sure it was more interesting than this.The humor, or rather, lack thereof, is terrible. I don't remember even chuckling for the entire duration of this 87 minute nightmare. Those 87 minutes must have been in fox minutes, because it felt like an eternity. Usually these animated movies score quite well in the humor department, but this movie manages to elevate the ability to not-engage an audience to an art form. It's really quite impressive.I don't even know what the purpose of this movie was. It failed to deliver on all fronts, and I can't imagine any of the people working on this genuinely feeling satisfied with the end result. At no point did I feel drawn into the movie. Honestly, I stopped watching after about an hour. I had to work really hard to even make it that far, but at a certain point I just gave up. I honestly don't care if the foxes made it out alive, or whatever happened to any of the characters. They could all be electrocuted and left to die for all I care.

To make it work, to give the ""items"" (animals in this case) emotion and character is anything but easy. You have to care for them, laugh and maybe even cry with them.Something that this movie achieves so easily, it's almost frightening. Wes was not on set, but gave his ideas and opinions to the animators and they brought it to life. Many kudos to them, who admitted, not being used to work like that before. Great voice artist help elevate the really very good, fine dialogue further.A movie for almost everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Sophiscated, Funny, and Strangely Touching at the same time.","First of all, I've never gotten into Wes Anderson's work. I mean, he clearly has the talent and the smarts to direct a film, but his meticulously designed set-ups and dry humor and wit just sort of makes me feel unsatisfied and longing for something more whole and meaningful after the movie is done.So, as you can guess, I was really surprised to be impressed by this film, which stays close to Anderson's usual motifs and quirks without becoming too alienating for young children, or too repetitive compared to his other films such as The Darjeeling Limited. Not only that, but's it's made in old-fashioned, 70's-esque stop-motion animation which clearly wears the time and loving care went into it on it's sleeves.All the main characters are likable, with each of them getting equal screen time. None of them are complete idiots which is so prominent in today's animated cartoons and feature lengths. Also, they're all so nicely dressed in neat little human outfits, which gets the film bonus points.The dialogue is laced with clever jokes, puns, quips, conservations, and arguments that reflect the film's ""hipster"" atmosphere.The music is amazing, and clearly influenced by bluegrass, folk, and Eastern music cultures. With that, I suggest you get the soundtrack after seeing the movie.Without any doubt, this is the best out of all the animated movies this year.

.........Mr. Fox,"My emotions for this movie are quite mixed. First of all, as a big fan of furries here, I loved all the characters. All voiced perfectly err...well.

Legitimitely Good For All Ages,"I don't like it when films boast as being ""fun for the whole family,"" but it applies to this movie; this is a movie that good parents would show their kids. In a time when so many film companies, excluding Pixar and occasionally Dreamworks, decide that an obvious plot with moronic humor can be shoveled into children's' little heads because they're young, it does my heart good to see a film made that treats children like smart, mature people. It's about time somebody realized that children don't all laugh at farts. I was in stitches, myself, as was everyone else I went with. Don't think ""is it too mature for my baby?"" because then you're deciding to lessen your child's capacity for smartness. Let them see good films and get a better understanding of the world, as opposed to just showing them every movie that has a fart in the trailer. That's good parenting.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An enjoyable adaptation with a good plot, quirky humour and excellent casting.","From the very moment it begins, you immediately know it's a Wes Anderson movie: his fingerprints are all over it. Indeed, before it is even an adaptation of the Roald Dahl classic it's a Wes Anderson movie - and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I mean, what would be the point in making the film be exactly the same in style and tone as the book? The book is already marvellous in its own right, and it already exists so you could just go and read it. Both the book and the film deserve to be experienced (because the film is an adaptation, not a copy.)The movie is a stop-motion animation following the exploits of Mr. Fox, a retired chicken thief who now writes for a local newspaper after having a child. However, when he moves into a tree that just so happens to be across from three mean farmers, Mr. Fox can't help but get back into the game. The story mostly sticks to the plot of the book, but it does deviate slightly by adding in a few scenes before his retirement and by altering the ending. It also replaces his three children with Ash (Mr. Fox's son) and Kristoferson (Mr. Fox's Nephew) and places more emphasis on his relationship with his wife, Mrs. Fox. I don't mind the changes, however, as I feel that they do make for a more entertaining and fleshed out movie.The cast is comprised of a few acting heavyweights; most notably George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox, Michael Gambon as Bean and Bill Murray as Badger. Also joining the cast in much smaller roles (for only one or two scenes) are Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe and Adrien Brody. The cast help bring realism to the characters, and it's amusing to see animals hold human conversations. I have no complaints with any of the casting choices, as they all match their characters perfectly.'Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)'is filled with tiny little details that are barely noticeable but make the film unique and really show how hard the animators worked to bring this world to life. The stop motion looks choppy, but that is intentional as the film was shot in 12 frames per second instead of the standard 24. It's great stuff with plenty of stylistic flair. I especially liked the running gag where every expletive was replaced with the word 'cuss', so phrases like ""you scared the cuss out of us!"" were both common and amusing.Overall, the movie was an enjoyable animation with a good plot, quirky humour and excellent casting. It's certainly a Wes Anderson movie, despite its animated nature. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

There's no mistake that this is all Wes Anderson. The story isn't of much consequence. The dialog is filled with the dry wit that Wes Anderson is known for. The camera style on shooting head on remain even thought it's animation. Add to it, Wes has enticed the voice talents of all his famous friends including George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, and Jason Schwartzman. George is especially effective as the suave Mr Fox.

I didn't laugh once,"There has been a lot of love that has been put into Wes Anderson's ""Fantastic Mr Fox"", unfortunately all the love is for himself. Granted, there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self-consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny. The worrying thing is that I think it was, and this is the best that Wes Anderson could come up with.The animation is good in the close-up shots of the animals, however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess. There wasn't really anything special about the acting either, with Wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better. I'm pretty sure George Clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in South Park, one of them where he played a dog.The film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically, despite the film being set in England, all the good animals are typical Americans playing baseball, whilst the bad guys are stereotypical English with the most insulting English accents.

The whole thing looks truly excellent,"Fantastic, indeed.'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is a terrific stop motion animated film, which is unmistakably a piece of Wes Anderson's work. I enjoyed the whole film undoubtedly, though the first half is much stronger than the second. The opening piece of stop motion didn't actually fill me with confidence, but thankfully that immediately disappeared as the whole thing looks truly excellent.George Clooney is great in this, definitely the most I've liked a performance (from what I've currently seen, of course) of his away from the 'Ocean's flicks. Every member of the cast is top notch to be fair, from Bill Murray to Michael Gambon to Eric Anderson. Willem Dafoe is fun too.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Undeniably fantastic,"Fantastic Mr. Fox certainly lives up to the first part of the title with a breathtakingly beautiful and unique stop motion animation that's an all timer for animation as a medium and in classic Wes Anderson fashion, a really funny, mature and profound story.George Clooney is terrific in the lead role, it plays to his charming strengths whilst still giving him room to grow. Jason Schwartzman is really funny throughout and Like Clooney has a great arc as well. It's only a small part but Willem Dafoe is so good as an evil rat and really leaves a lasting impression.It's ridiculously impressive how much Wes Anderson's signature style can be transposed directly from live action to animation. The framing, the vibrancy and the way he moves the camera are all pretty much 1:1 and in some cases even more stylish than in live action.Also, a huge strength of the film is its pacing. It's less than 90 minutes even with the credits so it would struggle to overstay its welcome generally but it is incredible just how fast this moves and the sheer amount of characters, running jokes and arcs it juggles effortlessly.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Heart warming and fun family film.,"This is genuinely a heart warming film for all the family. The film is an adaption of the children's story by Roald Dahl, so the choice of stop motion filming is very apt as it makes it look very child friendly, plus there isn't any curse words, with the characters all saying ""cuss"" instead.The colour palette is just warm and cozy with lots of autumnal and natural colours...which just adds to the heart warming nature of the story. Whilst it does deviate from the source material, the story is still fairly true to the book, and even though it is a family film, there is still the snappy and witty dialogue that Wes Anderson films are famous for.It's worth adding that the contemporary soundtrack is excellent and the voice cast is A-Class and brilliant as you would expect! Some of the scenes are hilarious and show set creativity at its very best!Who knew Wes Anderson made great children's films!

I also really like the relationship between Ash and Kristofferson, it was really quite funny. Mr Fox is definitely the best character in my opinion apart from Kristofferson and the rat.

I have a phobia of wolves,"I am an English girl and Roald Dahl was a hero of mine when I was growing up. Wes Anderson is one of my favourite directors but the combination of American retro-styling with traditional English children's fiction is a little contrived for my taste. The highlight of the movie was the psychotic break during the finale scenes, when Fantastic Mr Fox is driving a motorbike with sidecar and abruptly stops next to a mountainous backdrop and sees the outline of a wolf. Despite unsuccessful attempts at communication the scene is a wonderful example of deranged film making. Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah. Blah blah blah.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A Film Rich in Text, Texture, Subtext and Fur and Fun Mixture...","Mr. Foxy Fox is voiced by George Clooney, but this isn't just some publicity stunt, Clooney has always been somewhat a foxy guy, handsome, clever in a funny way with a touch of darkness, when he says ""I'm just a wild animal"", it sounds like something Clooney would say about himself. The actor is no Day-Lewis but he has always been good in that particular range of smooth-talking small-time crooks, whose looks and natural swiftness make him get away with everything except with the one who won't take it. Because, you know guys like Clooney or foxes have their weakest point, which generally coincides with the heart.Felicity Fox comes only one minute later in the picture. Before, we just saw Foxy warming up a little, he's at the top of his game as number one thief, and in what other job would a fox excel if not stealing? In this movie, animals' personalities are defined by their archetypes but Anderson, faithful to Dahl's spirit, always find a little twist, a way to play with it rather than being chained to it. And the whole tonality of the film indicates that this is a rather adult-oriented movie. Indeed Mrs. Fox comes from the doctor, a few minutes later, during a fox-trap situation; she'll reveal what we didn't dare to suspect. It seems like Fox is caught in a worse trap with no getaway except the promise to go straight.Meryl Streep has always possessed that homely, motherly authority and creates the perfect contrast with Clooney. Together, they form a more believable couple than any live-action movie. As a matter of fact, it's a miracle how Anderson finds the perfect tone between a ludicrous premise (style-wise) and the authenticity of his characters. His movie is set in a world where humans and animals coexist and seem to live within the same standards, except for one thing: humans have all the rights, they can raise, domesticate, kill and eat animals, this is the only Disney territory where Anderson ventures. But the paradox of anthropomorphic animals confronted to normal humans is one of the film's most creative bits. It's interesting though that the two worlds rarely share the screen.The film is based on the childhood rhyme about three mean men, Boggus, Bunce and Bean, one fat, one short and one lean, they're three farmers who mind their own business (poultry, duck raising and cider) before they're victim of Fox' robberies. With the help of their new house's attendant Kylie Oppossum (Wallace Wollodarsky), Fox steals from the three farmers and make mortal enemies out of them. The three men will know no rest until they get Fox, digging him out to the point that all the furry animals are forced to live underground and risk starvation. But foxes have more than one trick under their sleeves and thankfully, the plot doesn't just rely on a simple humans vs. animals antagonisms, there are a few demons to overcome within the animalistic characters and Anderson treat them sometimes with the same three-dimensionality than the people from his live-action movies.In fact, anyone familiar with Anderson's style shouldn't be surprised by the kinship with his films.Anderson is a director who cherishes static shots and linear movements, in perhaps the style that is the closest to comic-books than any other directors or maybe animation à la Hanna-Barbera. In the film, characters run like in the old Atari video games, and the digging looks exactly the same except in the vertical sense. We suspect that the 'artistic license' was also forced by a few budget restrictions and the fact that Anderson isn't an animator from the start, but he finds a way to transcend possible flaws and turn them into old-fashioned visual delights, as the lack of green and blue provided a nice autumnal sepia texture. The eloquence of the scripts makes up for the static moments, many times people talk without necessary looking at each other, which also simplifies the use of stop motions.Overall, the stop-motion gives a real edge to the film and is perfect for a movie centering on furry and funny characters, each fox has a unique design and fur complexion accentuating the realism (while the human characters are more ordinary looking with the help of CGI). The real thrill of the film comes from the various personalities, and they're surprisingly believable. A masterstroke of characterization is Ash (Jason Schwartzman), the teenage son (two years in fox years) who could have been a little brat or an awkward teenager, like any of the ""Incredibles"" children, but he's a kid who lives in the shadow of his father, who's bullied because of his short height, who's everything his father is not, and who must suffer from the inevitable comparisons with his cousin Kristofferson, who's everything he's not. I never thought a movie would feature an archetype that has seldom been in movies: the perfect guy.After two Hayao Miyazaki's movies, which multiply the number of viewings by two to fully get the films' brilliance, my mind needed a rest. I pulled a Monty Python and said to myself: and now for something different. Yes, I needed to see something new, imaginative enough to challenge my perceptions but in a more soothing way. I didn't know what to expect exactly from ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"", but that ignorance was perfect, the film was exactly the medication I needed, I longed for something different and maybe the best compliment I can give to this Foxy adventure is that it's like no animated film I've seen before and like no animated film you'll ever see, from beginning to end. And one thing for sure, this Mr. Fox is indeed, fantastic.And as if ever needed, here's another offering that proves that Wes Anderson is as much an auteur as Miyazaki in the sense that he really invented a style, a form of storytelling that channels his own creativity, in total symbiosis.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wes Anderson's Humor Fits Perfectly in a Children's Classic?,"How did they pull this off? The movie is chock full of low brow, a-typical Wes Anderson adult humor. Yet, the stop-action animation, the characters, and a great deal of restraint from the director, has magically turned Fantastic Mr. Fox into an instant children's and adult classic.Dare I say this is the funniest Wes Anderson film? It's at least on par with my previous favorite, Rushmore. There is some criticism here about the precision of the adaptation, regardless, it is Wes Anderson's screenplay that sells this movie. I have not read the book, but I'm sure that some sense of heart was moved over to this theatrical version.The voice overs and mouth animation is spectacular. I don't think people realize how difficult it was to make this movie. The stop-action look and feel is what will sell the kids, and Anderson's screenplay will sell adults.See this movie.My 2009 top ten: 10.I Love You Man 9.The Road 8.Trick r' Treat 7.Taken 6.Drag Me To Hell 5.Inglourious Basterds 4.The Hurt Locker 3.Up 2.Fantastic Mr. Fox 1.District 9That probably sums up my opinion. 92/100",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Genuinely FANTASTIC!!!,"Fantastic Mr. Fox was a book I loved reading as a kid and Wes Anderson's adaptation of it is one of the best.Fantastic Mr. Fox is the story of a fox who steals from three farmers and finds himself and his family in trouble after the three farmers come to kill him.I remember watching this film as a kid and loving it but back then I wasn't able to appreciate the craft that went into it. Instead of following in the footsteps of Disney and Pixar's style of animation, Wes Anderson decided to adapt this using glorious stop motion. I have a huge amount of praise for anyone who decides to make their film using stop motion as it requires so much effort to get it right and after rewatching this film I can certainly say Wes Anderson got it right.Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of the most gorgeous animated films to ever be made. From the bright and warm colour palette of the countryside to the hair on the fox's faces and tails, this film is visually stunning. I cannot imagine how hard the designers and art team toiled to bring about the result we see on screen. It must have taken days, months and possibly years to execute everything perfectly. Hats off to every single person that worked on this film as their hard work definitely paid off.It doesn't end there as the screenplay and voice acting contribute to the experience. The script by Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach is charming, funny and witty throughout with some great humour in many scenes. This is a film that doesn't just cater to kids as Anderson and Baumbach have added plenty of adult humour and jokes to keep parents and adults thoroughly engaged. The voice acting is marvellous. George Clooney as Mr. Fox works incredibly well and Meryl Streep's Mrs. Fox is terrific as they have great chemistry with each other. The other voice actors ranging from Willem Dafoe to Jason Schwartzman also do a splendid job.There is a lot to like and appreciate in Fantastic Mr. Fox. It's a great adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel filled with clever humour, extraordinary stop motion animation and great voice acting. It's an absolute treat for kids and adults.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Animation Masterpiece, definitely","Different from others of Wes Anderson's movies, Fantastic Mr. Fox peculiarly rubbed me well. If not, it is one of my favorite animated movies ever. Here, all of the his stylistic trademarks and off-beat rhythms simply worked, and blossomed into a masterpiece of animation. The film doesn't just flourish in one category, it exceeds in all comedy, story, writing and animation at top form, with each element complimenting each other exemplarily.Fantastic Mr. Fox produced incredible character arcs, problems and relationships that slowly moved through the lens of the movie, then perfectly tied up at the end. There's also visual comedy achieved through animals' expressions, well-crafted insert shots in sublime animation. Kudos to Noah Baumbach because his style blended in when co-writing added the needed tenderness to Anderson's style. If you're still not satisfied with all of these, be prepared to be blown away by the marvelous stop-motion animation and photography in this movie. There is vibrance, symmetry and balance in every frame that gives out exceptional colors, warmth and comfort of cinema.There we go, Fantastic Mr. Fox.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Fun,"Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Delightful animation movie features stop motion, which has sadly been pretty much forgotten over the years, although a few examples show up every once in a while. The story here concerns a fox (George Clooney) who gets his wife (Meryl Streep), kids and the other animals kicked out of their homes after stealing chickens from a trio of farmers who then decide to take revenge on the animals. After letting everyone down the fox must try and come up with a way to strike back at the farmer and reclaim their land. FANTASTIC MR. FOX is rather refreshing because it's an original film that doesn't try to cater to any certain type of viewer and instead just comes off as a fresh work that can go into any direction it wants without having to play by any sort of rules. Based on a book by Roald Dahl, there's no question that this film isn't going to be for everybody but the story is so good, the visuals terrific and the voice work is downright wonderful and in the end if you're able to accept this type of film then you're going to love it. The visual look of the film is so beautiful that you really just want to pause scenes and gaze at the beauty in them. There are so many terrific looking scenes but one of my favorites is a POV shot of a rabid dog chasing the fox. Another terrific sequence comes when the fox has let everyone down and he stands out in the rain while his wife comes to talk with him. The look of the rain is unlike any visual I've seen in any movie before and it's certainly one I won't forget. The story itself allows for many kid-like qualities but the screenplay makes sure that adults will get the many jokes thrown their way. I really loved how the bad words were covered up by the creatures simply saying cuss and it's easy for the adults to fill in what word was suppose to be there. Clooney has one of the greatest voices out there when it comes to giving off any sort of emotion and I thought he was terrific here. He can do sly and be a smart aleck while at the same time being charming and he brings that to the fox character and makes him quite memorable. The supporting voices include Streep, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe among others. I'm really not sure how many kids will enjoy this thing but those familiar with different types of animation will probably find this to be quite refreshing. Its sense of humor and messages are all very well handled and when you consider the talent and look this is certainly a must-see.",,Anonymous,Animation
"A light, pleasant to watch movie","Fantastic Mr. Fox is short, sweet, and fun. The animation and direction are well done and exude a general happy tone.

Effortlessly charming and visually inventive.,"For some reason everything Wes Anderson does seems so off-beat yet so calculated, it has the same amount of the dreaded ""quirkiness"" and charm as other films, it just feels so forced and worst of all at times fake.In saying that this is his best film since Bottle Rocket.I hated The Royal Tenenbaums for the F-word above, liked Rushmore more for what it wanted to be (and perhaps what I wanted it to be), and thought The Life Aquatic a spectacular failure that had potential greatness somewhere in it - if that even makes sense.(As an aside I also watched The Darjeeling Limited and liked it, but didn't feel passionate about it enough in any one direction to have an opinion on it.)Now given that we have a director who wants to peddle charm and quirkiness in equal and liberal amounts, what better setting than the re-telling of a children's story about a cast of human-like animals told in stop motion animation?If you can come up with a more ideal scenario please tell me, I can't do it. (Better yet tell Wes Anderson!)George Clooney is (not yet Fantastic) Mr Fox.His Mrs Fox is Meryl Streep. - His lawyer-badger is Bill Murray. - (Later) His son Ash is Jason Schwartzmann.Sounds good already don't it?Early in proceedings Mr & Mrs Fox are a huntin' chickens, only a near miss caused Mrs F to demand that Mr F rethink his career path, as she is preggers.Fast forward 2 years, or as we are told 12 Fox years.>>>>>>>>>>Mr Fox is now a successful local journalist with the a young son and devoted wife, only he feels that living in the ground is somehow beneath him, or at least the ground. He wants some new digs that don't require digging, and after ignoring the sage advice of his lawyer takes residence in a tree near three dangerous-to-animals local farmers. At the same time Ash's cousin Kristofferson comes to stay with the family, which doesn't impress Ash as the newcomer seems superior in every way.While everything seems perfect from the outside, Mr Fox is toey and decides to pull off one last job, or three last jobs if you will, as he sets out to rob from each of the neighbouring farms.So with Kylie the opossum alongside for the lark, Mr Fox does exactly that, and incurs the inevitable wrath that comes with stealing from dangerous farmers.The three farmers band together to eradicate their local pests and his family, firstly with shovels, then ditch-diggers, then explosives, forcing Mr Fox to do something to both save his family, their friends and earn the kudos that come with the title of Fantastic.Stop motion animation is at once strange yet it draws you in with the herky-jerky actions, Wes Anderson obviously had a great time with the device and some of the visuals are hilarious, including a letter scene that involves many animals dancing to celebrate success, and a musical number that is genuinely charming.This is the perfect vehicle for Anderson as some of his dialogue sounds forced and unnatural when coming from a human, but for whatever reason movie-goers are more forgiving when the same intricate dialogue is said by an animal. After all, if we accept that an animal has the capacity for speech, it isn't a stretch to expect them to be witty, urbane and whimsical.Wes Anderson also has a great ear for music, and his films always have memorable and catchy tunes that don't seem to be used in other films, (and always the Rolling Stones. Always.) The music is also cleverly integrated as Mr Fox carries on his person a walkman that he turns on and off with relevant music to support his thoughts or actions.The voice acting thankfully doesn't have the distracting impact of making you think ""Hey, that's Bill Murray"", the dialogue is dry and witty and the puppets (?) spectacularly detailed and well designed.Mr Fox has amazingly long skinny legs and a great clothes designer, and the various animals that they come across are all unique yet faithful to the actual source animal, and for some reason George Clooney's voice coming out of his mouth just seems right.If Wes Anderson has the choice between making self indulgent films like Tenenbaums and The Life Aquatic, or making self indulgent films like this, I sincerely hope that he goes down this path. Tim Burton seems to have done exactly that, and despite the awkward Chocolate Factory gaffe he is chugging along nicely.Final Rating – 7 / 10.

"Fantastic is certainly the word for it, all right","For those who've grown just a wee bit tired of all those ""family-friendly"" animated features we've been inundated with over the years, I commend to you ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" Wes Anderson's sly little creation that, for once, is aimed less at the kids in the audience than at the adults. Not that it is particularly crude or vulgar - it's certainly no ""Fritz the Cat,"" and even the swearing is covered-over by the characters uttering a generic ""cuss"" - but its themes and dialogue are pitched at a generally higher level of sophistication than we are accustomed to in such works.Based on a book by the beloved Roald Dahl, the story focuses on the dapper Mr. Fox, a recovering chicken thief who, at the behest of his wife, has given up his predatory ways in favor of domestic responsibility as a husband and father and a career as a newspaper columnist. What could be more respectable than that? But old habits die hard, and Mr. Fox soon discovers he must remain true to his carnivorous nature, leading him to enlist a few of his friends and neighbors of various species in a scheme to raid some local farms and make off with their poultry. This lands him and his buddies in hot water with both the owners of the farms and the heavily armed authorities who are called in to support them.Like Anderson's live-action works, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" (co-written by Noah Baumbach) owes much of its charm to the scattered, random and quirky nature of the material and its presentation, with a narrative so full of side forays and offbeat, eccentric characters that the movie feels as if it's constantly renewing itself as it's going along. There is wonderful voice work by George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson and Willem Dafoe, clever in-joke references to spaghetti westerns and ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" a funny subplot involving Fox's son and his obsession with proving his athletic prowess to his inattentive dad, and a simple, clean, streamlined look that combines a minimum of stop-motion movement with remarkably true-to-life backgrounds.It may not be a great animated film, but it is one of the more original and refreshing ones we've come across in quite some time.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beautifully Done...,"To call Fantastic Mr.Fox a children's movie is a disservice to the film. This is just as adult as most of Wes Anderson's R rated features, in the sense of the maturity of the plot and character development. The only thing missing from the movie is profanity, which isn't even really that extreme in any of his movies anyway.Mr.Anderson seems to have an obsession with amateur criminals, and this is also prevalent in Fantastic Mr.Fox. Bottle Rocket was the defining movie for a group of idiots trying to be criminals, but even in The Life Aquatic you see the clumsy theft of the sea lab and the ridiculous rescue attempt. In Fantastic Mr.Fox, most of the crimes go fairly well until the consequences are made evident. Ash's attempt to free Kristofferson was an incredibly memorable scene in this movie because of the unprofessionalism that it presented.What was great in this movie was that the characters were so real that you almost forgot they were animals. My only complaint about the film is that a lot of kids will see it and feel confused and possibly not entertained due to the dry humor that it uses. This was a major bonus for me, as I am a huge fan of dry humor, but children may not understand and a lot of adults don't find it funny.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The sum of morals exposed in this movie are just too many for me to write about here, however what I can say is that they are delivered seamlessly. The art direction is one that cannot fail, from my point of view.

'Fantastic Mr. Fox' is cleverly executed,"Based on Roald Dahl's children's novel of the same name, Fantastic Mr. Fox is about a thieving fox named Mr. Fox. Once he finds out his wife is pregnant, he sheds his thieving ways, raises a family and becomes a journalist. However, his old habits don't remain dormant for long and he starts to steal chickens, ducks, turkeys, and cider each night from three mean and wealthy farmers--Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Fed up, the farmers decide to try to ambush him with whatever means possible, which causes a lot of grief for his family and friends.Directed and written (based on Dahl's novel) by Wes Anderson (Rushmore), Mr. Fox has been created in the old school tradition of stop motion animation. While the creatures may not look slick and perfect like CG, they have an infectious charm of looking handcrafted, cuddly, and solid. Their facial expressions and their movements have subtleties that give a human touch you don't get with CG.When I was in elementary school, I recall a time when the teacher read us the book. I remember the story being not too complicated. It did, however, make me want to try apple cider—I loved the way the author described it. Here, the plot, dialogue, and characters have been expanded to create a satiric story full of ironic touches, extra details, and modernized. These details really set the mood. The animals are all fully dressed and talk like adults, about their family issues, mortgages, and life decisions. Mr. Fox's family includes his wife Mrs. Fox, his son Ash, and his overachieving nephew, Kristofferson. The family dynamics are fun and almost sitcom-like. I suppose they could have their own TV show. The animal neighbors of Mr. Fox are equally human in their behavior, with a dash of erratic animal wildness thrown in.The three farmers play the bad guys, and while most humans aren't portrayed as complex as the animals, the meaner characters are presented with flourish. Mr. Bean (I think that was the farmer's name), the leader of the farmers, is lean, sinister-looking, covered in shadows, has a pistol in hand and eerily-lit cigarette lighting his face. The music also plays an integral part in creating various moods of the film, including a zany musical number involving banjos, and occasional retro-style soulful vocals. There are also moments that parody other films, such as West Side Story.Anderson's dialogue is clever, and Mr. Fox is quite the spitfire with words. I bet some kids will find the wordiness a little boring (although amusing for us adults). Nevertheless, it is a fun film, something's always happening, and there's plenty of breezy action. It's definitely a lot lighthearted than Where The Wild Things Are (a fine, analytical film, if not particularly focused for the kids). For those who are purists of the source material, they may find this film a little too smug and Mr. Fox too aware of himself for his own good.George Clooney in the voice of Mr. Fox is a perfect fit—in fact, the role must've been tailor-fit for him. One can't imagine anyone else playing Mr. Fox. Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox and Bill Murray as Badger are fun, and Willem Dafoe as Rat (a villain role) is hilarious. Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fun film that is cleverly written and executed, helped by George Clooney's star power and delivery. For some, it may seem like Mr. Fox is constantly winking at the audience, but even those who may not love the film will still find many things to like about it. I give this film *** out of **** stars.You can see more of my review updates on http://twitter.com/d_art",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"creepy at first, then completely awesome","The best film Wes Anderson directed is The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. Fantastic Mr. Fox however, comes in second. Except when you watch all the extras and find out how hard puppetry really is . . . 18 seconds recorded in 8 days? . . . are you kidding me? What dedication. Thank you so much, puttetry's, sorry if I spelled that wrong, for your efforts. It is greatly appreciated by my family. I'm 31, my two daughter's are 3 and 1. They LOVE your movie, the Fantastic Mr. Fox, thank you ever so much for this wonderful contribution. I still can't figure out if my girls are just weird (in a good, Wes Anderson kind of way, of course) or what, but it makes me very proud that they chose the Fantastic Mr. Fox (on Blu-Ray of course) over a cartoon. I don't care if it makes my children weird that they prefer to watch Fantastic Mr. Fox and Coraline over all the other kid movies we have. It makes me happy, that they prefer this artistic art form . . . thank you ever so much. Nothing will compare.Kat",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
After the Fox,"Highly entertaining fox(y) caper with more of the director's quirks than Dahl's left intact, i.e. there's always enough room left for strange side glimpses into the character's spleens while the speedy narrative itself feels slightly mechanical and thin after a while. The good voice cast is of great help, though.But the most interesting aspect of Wes Anderson's first-time foray into feature-length stop-motion animation (though there were some animated sequences in earlier pics) is certainly the clash between wild-life instincts and a civilized way of living. The anthropomorphism we're used to in most animated movies surely gets scrutinized in this pic.As with all of Anderson's work, likably off-key, but somewhat distancing and too self-absorbed on the whole.6 out of 10 dumb opossums",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"I Liked It, But This Isn't For Kids","""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the story of the titular Mr. Fox, his family, his stealing shenanigans and his rivalry with the three notorious farmers from whom he stole. This film is an adult version of a children's story by Roald Dahl, as interpreted by American director/writer Wes Anderson. It was interpreted in rather old-fashioned-looking, almost monochromatic (orange-yellow-brown) stop-motion animation. The attention of my sons were not held by the slow beginning and by all the talking. My daughter was not even interested to watch it at all.I, on the other hand, quite enjoyed it. The dialogue is funny and witty, and very adult. There is even a hilarious attempt to hide all profanity with the word ""cuss"". I do not really like stop-animation movies (like ""Gumby"" or ""Wallace and Grommit""), but their pain-stakingly detailed efforts are appreciated.George Clooney definitely inhabits the character of Mr. Fox. He appropriately channeled Danny Ocean, especially in light of the heists that Mr. Fox was pulling, complete with smug attitude. Meryl Streep portrays Mrs. Felicity Fox. I felt there was nothing really special about it. Any actress could have done it just as well. Apparently the supporting cast is composed of actors who are staples of Wes Anderson films like Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Jason Schwartzman, etc. I particularly liked how Murray voiced Attorney Badger.I read an excerpt of ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" from the Roald Dahl book that we had. It turns out while the main characters and the stealing capers are similar, the rest of the movie (like the cousin rivalry, among others) is entirely Wes Anderson. I had never seen a Wes Anderson movie before, although I had long heard of his work like ""Rushmore"" or ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". But after watching ""Mr. Fox,"" I think I will check them out.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Unique Treasure,"I had never heard of this film until recently. I had absolutely no expectations. At first, I thought it was maybe just a goofy kid's film.Boy, was I wrong. This film blew me out of the water.The film's true value diminishes in repeat viewings, probably because the film is so fresh and so unique. Watching it 8 years after its release, it still feels new and original. As long as you don't have any expectations, over the course of the movie it will constantly up the ante on comedy, plot, and themes.By far, the best parts of the film are the voice acting, dialogue, and animation. The cast may seem like throw-away star-power on paper, but upon watching, the actors are all spectacular, and their star power is no distraction at all. The dialogue is so surprising, quick, witty, and humorous. And the animation is a fresh take on stop-motion animation, which was pretty rare at the time.I really don't have a lot of bad to say about the film. I hear that it isn't especially true to the source material, but I had never even heard of the Roald Dahl story. If you can shed your expectations of the film, it really is excellent.I am actually kind of worried that movies like this don't get more attention, and this film may actually be forgotten one day, despite being one of the greatest animated films of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not Anderson's best, in my opinion, but certainly a very entertaining movie","Fantastic Mr. Fox based off the classic story by Roald Dahl is a very abstract kids film done by legendary director Wes Anderson. This film by Anderson is aimed more at the family market (Which was expected to all those who have read or heard of the book) and it seems like he pulled it off. The movie is lined with a strong cast of acting professionals, ranging from starring roles (George Clooney, Merryl Streep) too supporting roles (Bill Murray) just to name a few. The movie sometimes goes out on a bit of a limb and while most of the time is funny and entertaining there are moments which are just plain annoying. The story, while not staying very true to the book, is executed moderately well by Anderson and although his style of directing may not fit as well into the family film market he certainly has made an entertaining film worth a watch. Overall I would give it a 7/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"brilliant colours, minutely perfect detail, gorgeous surround sound and wonderful music","On a rainy winter's day I loved watching the Blu-ray of Wes Anderson's stop action animated feature film of Roald Dahl's ""Fantastic Mr Fox"". The Blu-ray makes the most of the brilliant colours, minutely perfect detail, gorgeous surround sound and wonderful music (including The Rolling Stones to great effect). The voice actors Clooney, Streep, Murray and Gambon all turn in gifted performances. A valuable bonus is the extra 45 minutes of video which detail several aspects of the creation of the film - which makes the viewer value every second on the screen as part of two years of dedicated craftsmanship by a huge team of artists. I like that Wes Anderson has added a new prequel and sequel to Roald Dahl's original book, and that the resulting seamless ""trilogy"" has warmed the heart of Roald's widow (who appears in most of the bonus feature segments on the Blu-ray).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Numerous wonderful voice actors,"The story of Fantastic Mr. Fox follows the lives of the Fox family – Mr (George Clooney), Mrs(Meryl Streep), and their son(Jason Schwartzman) – and their animal neighbors and friends. Mr. Fox, once a professional chicken stealer, decides to settle down with his wife after she becomes pregnant and instead take up a career in writing. After moving to a new home in the trunk of a tree, Mr. Fox takes notice in three massive fowl and fruit farms. Risking everything. Mr. Fox decides to embark on one last big job – stealing from all three farms. What happens after that can only be described as pure confusion and debauchery.As with most Rhold Dahl stories, the book Fantastic Mr. Fox works to both excite kids and humor adults. As a result, the original short story is considered a classic for many families. Though some adaptations of Rhold Dahl classics (see BOTH adaptations of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) have strayed from Dahl's dry, quirky humor, the film version of one of his best loved stories have honored this side of Dahl's story, projecting a humor perhaps more suited to adults than children, but creating an overall story that will appeal to all.This movie would likely have been impossible without the work of numerous wonderful voice actors. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Owen Wilson all provide voices in the movie, among other lesser known but still wonderfully talented actors. As a result, the voices blend beautifully into the animation. Instead of feeling like characters with a voice shoved in, the voices and the characters are one.The animation is perhaps the most appealing aspect of the movie. The script and humor works with the animation in ways traditional or digital animation could not. In many instances, the animation itself provides part of the story. By using a more traditional method, Fantastic Mr. Fox is also able to provide very specific quirks and personalities to each character, something often lost in newer animation. Adding to the animation is a muted, fall palette of colors, giving the entire film a homey, comforting feel.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely gets better with multiple viewings,"When I first saw ""Fantastic Mr Fox"" back when it was first released, I did like it, but didn't think it was amazing. However, multiple viewings since have allowed me to reappraise the film, and it has now become one of my favourite films. I think I initially expected it to be a fairly straight adaptation of the Roald Dahl original (a modern classic I, along with many others in the UK, grew up with), something I should have realised it wouldn't necessarily be given Wes Anderson's unique way of fingerprinting his films. Upon successive viewings, I realised that Anderson had simply reinterpreted Dahl's vision in his own unique, beautiful fashion, and by doing so made it Dahl-esque in other ways. Definitely recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009),"Mr Fox is a fox and he acts as such. Stealing chickens and causing trouble for the three farmers that live close to him. The farmers soon decide that enough is enough and they are going to fight back. Anderson makes a pretty much perfect animated film. It has heart without the schmaltz, it has humour without immaturity, it has vocal talent without the overacting. Wes Anderson stays true to himself, covering his usual style and themes and filling the film with his style of humour. It's quirky and offbeat, without being irritating or pretentious. A lot of the delivery is fantastic and the script itself is simply sparkling with superiority. The animation was astonishing in it's complex simplicity. I love how Anderson used a slower frame rate to really make the animation obvious. Rather than being a distraction, it was captivating. I really can't wait to watch this again.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Anderson and his screenwriter Noah Baumbauch throw in inside jokes and adult humor without being self-indulgent or crude. Great use of music throughout plus plenty of great voice acting especially by Schwartzman and Wes Anderson's own brother Eric. A visually successful film that is creatively and meticulously designed. A true triumph of animated filmmaking and Anderson becomes one of the few live action filmmakers to be successful in animation arts.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Wonderful Surprise!!,"With Wes Anderson at the helm of Director, George Clooney finds himself in yet another snatch-and-run thief caper. Only this time you'll find yourself wanting to re-watch scenes and the entire movie over and over again. Stop-motion animation will always have a soft spot in my heart for nostalgic and technical reasons. I always want to see how far they would go and they always remind me of being dazzled by them as a kid. This movie delivers in much more ways than taking you back. Filled with endless quotes and humour that will make even the most robotic viewer bubble-over.I Like Wes Anderson's movies, they always come from a different angle with what the core story is and they always have a unique human element that you can both see yourself in and appreciate. Based on a story from Roald Dahl, we join up with Mr. Fox who is prompted to change his line of work as a poultry thief when his wife, Mrs. Fox, gets pregnant. The world is very detailed and feels very familiar as all the animals interact in an almost seamless human way whilst not abandoning their animal nature. The voice talent casting is superb as all the animals seem justly matched and equally theatrical. The story is very engaging from its start but gets even more-so when Mr. Fox, bored with being and overlooked newspaper columnist decides to don bandit hats with his possum friend, Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky), for one last big job – stealing goods from the three biggest farmers in the nearby town, Boggis (Robin Hurlstone), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and Bean (Michael Gambon). This plan, and its success, triggers the three farmers to deal with their fox friend and his family, therein putting all the wood lawn animals under siege and prompting Mr. Fox to be as fantastic as he can to rescue all the animals and get the farmers off of his back. With juggling all of this, Mr. Fox also finds himself at ends in his marriage and we get some Meryl Streep (Mrs. Fox) goodness, which is always sweet. Some fun arcs keep the fluidity of the movie both digestible and add an appreciation to the supporting characters, so much so that it makes you feel that no animal was 'just there'. For example- there is Mr. Fox's son, Ash, who tries his best to prove to his parents that he's not 'different' and has his father's athletic abilities with his efforts getting challenged by the likes of his subtle, thunder-stealing cousin, Kristofferson (Eric Anderson).I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as I didn't know what to expect. It delivers in so many ways from the beautifully illustrated environment,the nuances of each animal and their respective voice actor, the humorous dialogue, the story and the surprise depth of the highlighted characters. It feels like the cast and the production crew had fun with making this movie and viewers always benefit when that happens since glee is contagious. When you realize how painstaking it must've been to add life and unique style to all the characters and make the movie not-feel-like-a-stop-motion-movie for the viewer, the whole mood gets even more relaxed and enjoyable.George Clooney shines in his role as he brings enough cockiness and confidence to Mr. Fox as you'd expect from his stint as Danny Ocean. Wes Anderson doesn't abandon his favourite call guys either; Bill Murray and Owen Wilson both have fitting parts. Another great feature is how Wes blends the movie to appeal to both adults and kids. Its accessible world is engaging enough for the young and the wit in the dialogue is very rewarding for the adults, no one is alienated. Giving the villains the British grit adds another layer to it, especially when you remember Michael Gambon's role in Layer Cake.If there's any way you can organize a group of friends to watch this gem, do so, they will be very thankful for it and the flurry of inside jokes your group would gain is priceless.Standout Line: ""He gets a bandit hat?

Love the animation...,"Over the years many tales by Roald Dahl have been adapted for the screen, both for TV and for the big screen. This is the latest big-screen adaptation of one of his works. For me, while it was quite an engaging tale I felt it wasn't made for an audience outside the United States. This is not a criticism, it just seemed to me that it had all become a little too 'Americanised' (if that's a word). The stop-motion animation, the sets and everything technical about it was very well done but I felt the characters had lost the mystique they had when I read this as a youngster. I will always now hear George Clooney as Mr. Fox and to me that's all wrong (I explain why later). Here's a very brief summary of the plot, and then some more of my thoughts.Mr. Fox loves to steal chickens, ducks, anything he can eat or drink really. Unfortunately this is a dangerous business and his wife persuades him to find a safer occupation when she falls pregnant. So he takes up writing for a local newspaper. Several years later he decides it's time they moved and so they go to live in the trunk of a tree. This affords him a great view of three local farms, owned by Franklin Bean, Walter Boggis and Nathan Bunce. Unable to resist the temptation he enlists the help of Kylie Sven Opossum and raids all three farms. The farmers aren't going to take this lying down and Mr. Fox and his family, and in fact the whole community, find themselves trapped. Can Mr. Fox find a cunning way to save the day? As usual, my contract with the Spoiler Police prevents me telling you here.I love the animation of this film, I always think stop-motion gives a very unique look and it works really well here. Although I have a slight dislike for the accents, to me Mr. Fox should be a very devious upper class English accent, but hey, you can't always get what you want as the Rolling Stones once said. Anyhow, a decent effort from the voice talents of; George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox, Bill Murray as Badger, Michael Gambon as Franklin Bean and even Jarvis Cocker who gave us a song as Petey.So, in conclusion, visually, it's a treat, I love the look and feel of the film. Plot wise, well it's based on a Roald Dhal story so you can't go too far wrong there. I liked the choice of music in the film, a couple of Beach Boys numbers were very welcome. I think if it wasn't for the voices I would have enjoyed it more, but it's worth seeing for the animation.My Score: 6.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
That film makes you wanna dance!,"I just watched that little piece of art and I am in such a good mood, like nearly no other movie has put me in! If that's not one of the best feel-good movies, you can call me a stupid fox. I'm a big fan of Mr. Anderson's works, but I was also a little bit skeptic of him doing an animated feature. But ""Hell Yeah"". Do it again! That movie is sweet, good-looking, funny, has the great dialogs and characters every Anderson film has and is simple a joy to your eye. After having been disappointed by many movies in the last weeks George Clooney really helped me to get over all those Avatars and Wild Things out there! Up in the Air and of course Mr. Fox are two movies really worth-watching. And I would say this movie deserves and Oscar! But I would say that about most Anderson movies ;).

this is cussing good,"So I watched Wes Anderson's adaptation of the book The Fantastic Mr. Fox, so is it good I say unenthusiastically yes. It wasn't great but it was good. Once again I have not read this book, but as a child read other Roald Dahl books and loved them. So why without enthusiasm, well I guess the story doesn't seem to go anywhere I guess. The end was the end, and that is about that. I liked how every ""cussing"" cus word was said as ""cus"", something cute for adults that still made the film a ""kids movie."" I also liked the ravenous eating habits as well as the animation technique. I have enjoyed all of Wes Anderson's films including ""The Life Aquatic"" (though marginally in that particular case), and I saw elements of his unique visual style translated into animation. The acting is good with an award winning cast, and the movie is very watchable for children. I am a big kid so I liked it, but I did not love it and do not think this film is for everyone out there, and think even amongst the intellectual sect there is probably much disagreement as to the worth of this film.

Has its place,"Didn't quite meet expectations but still okay I guess. Wes Anderson is definitely a director who carries specific traits to all his films and although I enjoyed ""The Darjeeling Limited"", and ""Rushmore"" wasn't BAD or anything, I still don't get the fuss over ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"" (is it the ironic surreal ""humour""? the soundtrack? Bill Murray?). To sum up Anderson's tac to film-making is simple: ""off-beat, ironic, absurdist sense of humour"". However, it often fails, and in the case of ""Fox"", the frequent (yet sparsely successful) stabs at humour arguably get in the way of what could (and again arguably should) be a whacky inventive narrative. Despite this, the film was an interesting experience - most notably because I initially persisted to attempt to view it as a child's film - when on the whole, it really isn't and it's plain to conclude from a number of conversations that it really wanted to be 'adult' and swear and talk about sex. Considering the reputation of the title's original novel, this is a reality that ultimately couldn't materialise - which is a real shame because I think the humour might have actually worked if it could. I wasn't entirely impressed by the soundtrack either sadly. If perhaps Anderson had asked Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo to write music like he has done on so many occasions already (suitably a veteran in soundtrack-writing for children's programming -repeat 'children's'), I could be claiming different. I won't say the movie's bad because honestly, it isn't really. Most Roald Dahl stories, no matter how wide a film treatment can be, always seem to wind up finishing excellent and though I probably wouldn't choose to watch this film again, it has its place.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
How the cuss did this movie get a rating of 8?,"I consider myself a movie liker. I watch lots of movies and tend to fall for the types that either bring me something new or tell a great story. I think I am open minded towards films and watch lots of 'off' type and foreign flick.Still, I couldn't get this movie. It's a kids story which does a poor job of following Roald Dahl's great children's book. Where the book had some originality and fun, it is still for children. Making a movie out of it with an A-list of voice actors gives the impression it's not for children. And to be honest, there's not much for children to be found here. There's not a lot of good humor going around - the conversations are not at a children's level and well, the story just isn't very adventurous or appealing. For adults however, there's also nothing to be found - the humor isn't good enough to keep you entertained and the story and animation itself are ... bad. This movie just has not much going for itself, apart from the voice actors, who do a great job. Adding to insult, the script is totally different from the book and doesn't do the great author Dahl justice.In the end, you're left with a movie that you expect to find at the Disney channel on a Sunday afternoon.

"Fantastic, Mr. Anderson","This delightful animated film has Wes Anderson's fingerprints all over it, which is a great thing if you like his movies as much as I do.Present are the vague melancholy and yearning for something bigger and better that so many of Anderson's characters feel in so many of his movies. They're never completely happy, because they never know exactly what it is that will make them happy, a conundrum supremely identifiable for his audiences. But what might feel like tedious existential angst in the hands of some colder and more cerebral director never does with Anderson, because he fills his movies with warmth and wit.""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is beautiful to look at and has terrific voice work from big stars like George Clooney and Meryl Streep. But the standout is Anderson regular Jason Schwartzmann, as a young fox with serious inadequacy issues.""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the best animated film I saw last year -- yes, better than ""Coraline"" and ""Up.""

I loved the cuss out of this film,"Very interesting to see an animated film by Wes Anderson, but I loved it. It is a film that both adults and kids can enjoy. All the characters in the film were excellent. You really get addicted to watching them. The voice talent was a great pick also. George Clooney was the perfect voice for Mr. Fox. Mr. Fox really had the same personality as him. Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and even Willem Dafoe as an evil farmer. They really knew who to pic for this cast. This film really brought me back to a feeling when I was younger and would watch shows animated like this in the mid day. The film gives you a certain joy and happiness in your heart and believe it or not, you feel like you need more. You wouldn't think that a film like this could make you feel excitement, but it will. You truly get an inner energy while watching. The movie is cute, funny and really has a great story. Plus there are little things that happen that make this film more original. The script has many parts when the actor should swear. But instead of swearing, they say the word cuss. So it would be something like this. ""What the cuss do you think you are doing?"" Every time that happened, it made me laugh. Also, remember that they are wild animals. So when the foxes eat, they eat all crazy like.

"Beautiful Animation And Wonderfully Witty Humour, But Terrible Pacing And A Lack Of Fleshed Out Characters","Pros:
1. The animation is gorgeous, thus producing some incredible shots as well as allowing for a lot of emotion to be shown in the animated faces.
2. The cinematography is great which allows for a plethora of unique and eye-catching scenes.
3. The editing and cutting are top-notch; this helps to add tension and suspense when appropriate for example.
4. The humour is witty and dry, but it works really well considering that it perfectly fits the persona of Mr. Fox (George Clooney).
5. The zippy score and soundtrack help give the film a lot of energy which nicely moves the scenes along.
6. There are fantastic voice performances by George Clooney, Jason Schwartzman (Ash), Willem Dafoe (Rat) and Michael Gambon (Franklin Bean).Cons:
1. The lighting is sometimes too dark, making it difficult to see what's going on.
2. The movie is somewhat incoherent in its storytelling, more so at the beginning, making it difficult to comprehend.
3. The pacing is far too rushed therefore the character development is minimal, which leaves most characters feeling one-dimensional.
4. Due to the immoral, antagonistic and hypocritical actions of the animal characters, in addition to the poor character development, it's almost impossible to root or care for them.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fantastic Mr. Flick,"""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a 2009 animated film directed by Wes Anderson. It is based on Roald Dahl book. Both Anderson's distinct directing style and Dahl's unique charm shine in this adaptation. It keeps Wes Anderson love of symmetrical shots, long takes and dry sense of humor. It likewise incorporates the unique world with grounded yet outrageous characters.This film has a distinct animation style. If you take any still frame from this movie, you will immediately be able to recognize what film it is from. The animation is a distinct wabi sabi, finding beauty in imperfection. Everything is just a little bit off. It is like they are doing stop motion with taxidermized animals.The voice acting is stacked with celebrities. But they are not cast simply for their star power, all the voices fit their animal counterpart.Not all the comedy works, Anderson and Dahl have a very distinct sense of humor. Sometimes those long pauses lead to hilarious timing, other times it is just an awkward pause. A lot of the jokes are just pointing out how strange a situation is. Some characters and plot points seem tacked on. There's a part where all the characters need to utilize their talents, and I don't know who half of them are.But as a whole, this really is a fantastic film. I admire how unique the presentation is, and how creative the characters are. This film gets a 7- StarFox.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Truly Underrated!,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is a really good animated feature, that despite its critical praise, is vastly underrated. I use this term because it made next to nothing at the box office and the audience have not been giving this movie the greatest reviews. But, this is what a Wes Anderson movie should be. A quirky tale with above-average storytelling.This is about a fox who goes back to his old ways and steals things from three angry, older men. These dastardly men now go for revenge against Mr. Fox, his family, and all his other animal friends.The voice casting works just fine. I recognized great talent such as Clooney, Streep, Murray, Wilson, and Gambon. Also, Wes Anderson's directing is solid and he stays true to the source material even though he obviously added some content.Overall, this is a great, underrated animated film. Studios should make more stop-motion films in the future. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
They think they're charasmatic.,"Bemusing feature with a very unclear agenda.It's important to shake off any pre-conceived notion of what you want the book to look like as a movie, especially if you've actually read it.But that just makes the movie seem strangely motiveless to me. They should either have changed a lot more or a lot less.What was originally just an anecdote of the small outsmarting the big and armed has now become a story of fathers and sons and proving yourself. It has heart and a lot more heart than it has wit. (Get it?)The narrative thumps along engagingly enough and figuring out what they're trying to say about bold characters provides some distraction too. The tit-for-tat *almost* clever dialogue is also something scratch your head at and moments inserted intact from the book, stick out jarringly.It's the aesthetics that really shine. If Hoodwinked is the best animated movie with the worst animation...well...the vibrant autumnal ambience and the attic-toy puppets are what really make this worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Shot for Suave, Ended Up with Dull; Stop-Motion from Half a Century Ago","Fantastic Mr. Fox (1:26, PG) — Other: Talking Animals, 2nd string, originalRay Harryhausen's Jason and the Argonauts, with its platoon of sword-wielding skeletons, came out in 1963. For the math-challenged, that's almost half a century ago. You'd think that the state of the art in stop-motion animation would have shown some advances since then. And indeed it has, if you look at the never-ending feast of delights from Nick Park's Aardman Studios, home of Chicken Run and various Wallace & Gromit features. And of course there's Tim Burton's brilliant The Nightmare before Christmas, directed by Henry Selick, who went on to use the technique extensively in Coraline.Return with us, then, to those halcyon days of half a century ago, this time at feature length, for really crappy stop-motion animation in Fantastic Mr. Fox. The story was based on a book by the estimable and unpredictable Roald Dahl, so you'd think it would have potential, but the screenplay by Noah Baumbach and director/producer Wes Anderson is pretty uninspiring. Mr. Fox (roguishly voiced by the perfect choice, George Clooney) has agreed to give up raiding the henhouse to placate his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep). But, like Danny Ocean, he's gotta go back for 1 more job — well, maybe 2, make that 3 — in the company of his amiable but dull opossum buddy Kylie.These raids understandably tick off the farmers, Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, and they retaliate against not only the foxes but all the other burrowing creatures in the vicinity, attacking with steam shovels, explosives, and a deluge of apple cider (the specialty of Farmer Bunce), apparently more readily available than plain water. Running, scrambling, some shooting, and encounters with beagles and electric fences ensue, but nobody seems to get particularly worked up over anything. Evidently Anderson was going for suave, but he just ended up with dull.All the creatures stand upright and wear ill-fitting human clothes. They speak like adults, except for the cloying convention of substituting a standard kid-safe epithet where it's obvious what any normal English speaker would have said, as in ""This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everyone."". Ugh.Other cast members who probably pulled in substantial paychecks for their efforts include Jason Schwartzman (fox son Ash), Bill Murray (badger), and Willem Dafoe (rat). In return for the savings the producers could have realized by hiring regular voice actors instead of big- name stars, they could have afforded better special effects. But what the pic really needed was another couple of runs thru the typer.Too bad. This was an effort to try something outside the mainstream, and I normally root for those, but they've still gotta deliver. This one just wasn't anywhere near fantastic enuf.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

What The (curse) !,"When I found out that Wes Anderson had a new film in the can ready for release some months back,I was jumping for joy (I've been a fan of Anderson's work for some years now,which includes 'Rushmore','The Royal Tennenbaums,and 'The Darjeeling Limited',and others). When I found out further that it was to be an animated adaptation of Roald Dahl's book,'The Fantastic Mr.Fox',I was doing cerebral back flips. Wes Anderson directs a screen play written by Anderson & Noah Baumbach (The Squid & The Whale),based on the book by Roald Dahl (Charlie & The Chocolate Factory,James & The Giant Peach,etc.). The story concerns the afore mentioned Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney),who finds out from his life partner ,Mrs.Fox (Meryl Streep,last seen in 'Julie & Julia',and currently in 'It's Complicated') that she's expecting a fox pup,in a farmer's steel trap & promises if they get out,he would renounce his evil ways & make a nice life for both of them. Problem is,some years later,he gets the old itch to go out & kill chickens & steal food. In the tradition of the 'Oceans' series,he schemes one more heist from the local farmers. Problem is,one heist turns into another & another,until things get out of control. Besides George Clooney & Meryl Streep,the likes of Anderson regular,Jason Schwartzman,Bill Murray,Owen Wilson,as well as the likes of Michael Gambon,Willem Dafoe, & even Wes Anderson,himself, lend their voices to this fun little film that despite the wave of 3D-CGI animation,instead settles for old school stop motion animation (the same kind of animation used for Gumby,Wallace & Gromit,and others),which,although not the best stop motion animation I've seen,is still worth seeking out. Rated PG by the MPAA,this film serves up some occasionally harrowing action scenes,some suggested rude talk (the characters substitute the word ""curse"" for the real thing),and a bit of smoking & drinking by the humans in the story.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
About the value of community and family,"Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Anderson's retro stop-motion animated version of the classic Roald Dahl novel, tells the story of the charming rogue, Mr. Fox who, through a series of adventures and misadventures, learns the value of community and family. It is a hard lesson to learn, however, and eliminating larceny from his life may be too big a stretch for Mr. Fox who, after all, tells his wife that he poaches poultry ''because I'm a wild animal."" George Clooney is the silky smooth voice coming from Mr. Fox's mouth while Meryl Streep voices the role of Mrs. Fox. Both Clooney and Streep seem completely at home in their roles, giving the movie even more bounce and joie de vivre.Anderson, working with co-screenwriter Noah Baumbach, connects with Dahl's sensibility but expands on the story, bringing in diversions such as the game of ""whack-bat"" and a Tennenbaum-like helping of family dysfunction. The main idea of the book remains, however, that once we are sure of who we are, we have the strength to take on even the most determined adversaries, for example, ""three of the meanest, nastiest, ugliest farmers"" in the world. When a young Mr. Fox learns that his wife is pregnant, he makes a promise to stop his life of chicken thievery and turn into an honest man - 'er fox. Fast forward two years and the reformed Mr. Fox is now a newspaper columnist and has even changed his clothes from dapper to casual.He also has a son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman) whom he considers to be slightly weird because he wears a superhero cape. Looking into the possibility of buying a new home inside a beech tree that has lots of shade, he is told by his lawyer, Badger (Bill Murray) to stay far away because that tree is too close to the property of three mean farmers: Boggis (Robin Hurlstone), Bunce (Hugo Guinness) and, the nastiest of them all, Bean (Michael Gambon). Ignoring the advice of his lawyer, Mr. Fox not only moves into his new digs but plans one last bit of thievery to show the gleesome threesome who is boss.He brings back his old partner Kylie the opossum (Wally Wolodarsky) to aid in the crime but things become complicated when his athletic cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) comes to stay with the family and catches Fox's attention. Needless to say, the mature Kristofferson who also does yoga and meditation makes Ash jealous who, like most teenagers, is somewhat insecure and eager to please his dad. Fox brings the whole family together, however, to try and defeat the mean farmers in a three-part plan to steal chickens, turkeys, and spiked apple cider, taking them underground, through tunnels, and up into the streets.A bit too quirky and snappy for younger children, Fantastic Mr. Fox is more likely to appeal to teenagers with its eclectic soundtrack that includes Burl Ives, the Rolling Stones, the Beach Boys and the Bobby Fuller Four. Anderson seems to have had a lot of fun in making the film and it shows. With the 70s style costumes and animation technique, the feeling is of watching real characters in motion rather than being drowned in a sea of graphics. Ultimately, the story is what is most important anyway, and here a subversive Dahl novel is enhanced by the even more subversive Anderson, advising us that whether we are four-legged or two-legged, we should rejoice in the knowledge of how unique we truly are.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining,"Amidst the quirky charm and creative animation that Wes Anderson always gives us, there are some pretty somber themes: the difficulty of living up to parental expectations (the perfect nephew who steals their attention is pretty funny), why Mr. Fox feels compelled to steal and thus endanger all the other critters, and the insanity of the farmers' hyperbolic response. I didn't fully connect with the story and all of the humor but it's a film that's hard not to smile over, and I liked the myriad references to other films and celebrities.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delightfully fun Mr. Fox,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is an adaptation of a somewhat famous children's book by writer Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was originally written by him). I cannot really say if it's faithful or not (apparently not very much) nor can I say how much it compares to director Wes Anderson's other works (my fan friend says you have lots of his signature touches). However, I can say that it's likely adults will enjoy it more than kids. This is a completely stop-motion picture instead of the more ubiquitous 3d computer graphics showcase. It has a certain retro vibe to it and although it's charming, often funny, you shouldn't expect the animation quality and smoothness of Nightmare Before Christmas or Coraline. The jerkiness is especially noticeable when the animals are dancing. However, the faces and the (constantly moving) fur are especially well done. Actually, I suspect the many close-up shots were used to save on the animation costs of animating the whole puppet. Most importantly, the whole movie using real puppets, props and decors has a solid ""realness"" quality to it often absent from 3d graphics.Enough about that. How's the story ? Quite delightful and entertaining with personable characters and bundles of dry and awkward humor that actually works. The running gag of the opossum making swirly eyes when he gets confused never gets old. I also enjoyed variations on the word cuss used profusely instead of the famous f word. The voice acting is top-notch and George Clooney is a perfect fit for the suave and charismatic Mr. Fox. You'll notice his voice but you won't notice most of the other famous voices unless you're a big Wes Anderson fan. The dialogue is very fine and the choice of music is surprising, appropriate and good. Fantastic Mr. Fox is pretty fantastic and because of the way it was made and looks, this might age quite well and become a future classic. Whatever you do, don't let the fact that it's supposed to be a ""kid's movie"" deter you from watching it. For interested parents, it's not overtly violent although there's poultry killing (heard, not shown) and beyond the amusing antics, it even has some morale (but doesn't hit you over the head with it).Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stop Motion at the next level.,"The unique storytelling of 2009's Fantastic Mr. Fox surpasses any stop-motion film I've seen to date.The film is funny and wierd at the same time.

About the relationship between man and animal, animal and nature and man and nature.

Wes Anderson has done it again,"Wes Anderson has done it again with this superbly crafted stop motion animation. Expertly scripted, clever and quirky, Fantastic Mr. Fox is ""cus-ing""? brilliant. Funny and accessible for all ages with a soundtrack that is spot on, you get everything you have come to expect for a Wes Anderson film - it all just works together quite perfectly. The usual big names help bring Anderson's script to life, especially Clooney and Schwartzman. Mr. Fox, his wife, son and nephew's lives take a dangerous turn when Mr. Fox's animal instincts turn him to crime as he takes on 3 farmers for their stock and they stop at nothing to catch him. It's cool, quirky and everything you love from a Wes Anderson film. Whether your a fan of his films or watching for the first time, this is a great bit of entertainment. I always thought this deserved the Oscar for Best animated feature in 2009 but was pipped at the post by Pixar's ""Up"".

Not so Fantastic,"I can only say that for whatever reasons this had little appeal to me. It is not even 90 minutes and I felt the film dragging. I liked the animation style but this only held me for so long. The story is kind of repetitive – a series of chase and hunt scenes. Also it is overly wordy – hardly a few seconds go by without someone saying something that is allegedly witty, amusing or humorous. The whole thing became rather drab with characters being constantly added to make up for the lack of a substantial story-line.It fact, overall, it lacked in emotion and was on the dry side. I would hardly say this is for children – I'm sure they would be as bored as I was.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best Roald Dahl adaptations,"Directed by Wes Anderson, who would later direct Moonrise Kingdom, it tells the story about a fox who steals food from three mean wealthy farmers. Having been fed up with the fox's theft, they try to kill him and his family and it's up to the foxes to find a way to outwit them.Having seen other movies based on Roald Dahl such as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (along with the Tim Burton remake), James and the Giant Peach, and Matilda, I finally came across this not so long ago and to my surprise it turned out to be another great film considering I remembered reading that book when I was young.The story is very well written. It was keeping up with the source material while expanding upon it. Not to mention that it has some really adult humor which is done very well it can give you chuckles and laughs. It also has some touching moments involving Mr. Fox and his family. The pacing is very good and never has a dull moment and the music score from Alexandre Desplat (who composed the music for The Golden Compass and would later compose the last two Harry Potter films along with DreamWorks' Rise of the Guardians) fits the atmosphere of the film. The directing from Wes Anderson is perfect and the editing is very sharp.The stop motion animation provides some very good visual designs and character models along with some neat expressions. And last but not least, the voice work which by far is great. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, Michael Gambon, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, and Jason Schwartzman (who would later star in Netflix's Klaus in 2019) provide some unique personalities to their own characters while delivering the comedic moments very well.Overall, after a decade has passed, Fantastic Mr. Fox is not only one of the best stop motion animated features, but it's also one of the best Roald Dahl adaptations. Such a shame it didn't do very well at the box office because this is worth recommending to others. Go check it out! :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Kids will love it, adults will ADORE it!","Wes Anderson is my hero. No, really, I mean it! I mean, look back at all the films he's made: all the way from his debut masterpiece ""Bottle Rocket"", to his elegantly poignant ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", and even his box-office flop (but critically-acclaimed) ""The Darjeeling Limited"" and all the others in between. He's a filmmaker that takes dark comedies and takes them to hilariously high and moving levels, and his screen writing (usually teamed with another excellent filmmaker, Noah Baumbach) is among the best that Hollywood can come up with. He's a man who seems not to be able to do a superficial film, and each character he creates has infinite depth and wisdom and seems much more human than any, um, Jerry Bruckheimer could come up with (even though his films ARE good, too).Whatever. The point is that Wes Anderson has surprised me beyond limits. Here is one of the masters of dramatic, depressing comedies taking a book written by Roald Dahl (one of the most whimsical and best-selling children's' novelist) and making it into a stop-motion animated film for the entire family. Impossible, you say? I used to say that too, but after watching the end result, I can declare that Wes Anderson's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" won't disappoint any adult or child this year.Most of you already know the sinopsis of Dahl's book, but in a nutshell, the film is about Mr. Fox, Mrs. Fox and their son Ash who live a somewhat poor but content life in their burrow. Mr. Fox (George Clooney) used to be a chicken thief in his day, but after meeting Mrs. Fox and putting her in danger after discovering she's pregnant, he vows to stop the adrenaline-packed life of a chicken thief and becomes instead a columnist for a newspaper few people read. Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) seems to be okay with this, but Mr. Fox is going through heavy existential problems where his spirit is at unrest and where his animal instincts overpower him. Ash (Jason Schwartzman), their son, is a depressed and sour young fox who begs for society's attention but is usually overlooked or ignored because, let''s face it, he's unimpressive.Mr. Fox buys a beautiful, large tree from his real estate agent against the legal advice of his Badger attorney (Bill Murray), and it all seems ideal at first, but Mr. Fox is very much aware that his neighbors are none others than Bogis, Bunce and Bean, the three meanest farmers around...and also the wealthiest and the ones who farm and harvest the best chicken, turkeys and apples respectively. His instincts kick in, he begins stealing again, and soon finds himself in a heap-load of trouble. But, as the title of the film aptly highlights the word 'fantastic', this is no ordinary fox! Yes, it's a children's' story, and yes, it's a fable, but as much as it's fantastic and preposterous it's profound and intelligent. Obviously, Anderson has taken the artistic liberty of adapting the story as freely as his imagination (and his PG-restrained rating) will let him. He's omitted a character or two, he's added about seven more, he's stretched the story to include many more plot twists and he's given each character a roundness and a credibility that you'd never imagine seeing in a fox, a badger, a mole, or their likes. As in previous films, Anderson deals with topics such as existentialism, nature vs. nurture, not fitting in, dysfunctional families, excess of envy and, most of all, repressed emotion which will eventually explode in sudden bouts of depressing anger; yeah, definitely NOT topics for children...but how can I put it? Anderson has managed to tone himself down without reducing a smidgen of depth to a point where the film is adequate enough for children and marvelously moving for adults. Tell me, how many other filmmakers can do this? The dialogue is pitch-perfect, as always. The cinematography is grandiose and frames not characters per se, but entire settings; it makes the viewer feel like a voyeur including him or herself into these animals' life instead of simply an audience at a movie theater. Camera positions, cuts and dolleys add comedy to the events going on screen, and the sublimely country-ish score by Alexandre Desplat make this the perfectly-ambienced film.There are scenes of raw, heart-wrenching emotion: notice a scene where Mr. Fox fights with Rat during their second encounter, or the scene where Mr. Fox gives a toast at a supermarket; these scenes take your breath away and launch your brains into a cataclysm of thoughts and opinions about a wide array of topics. Notice other scenes, like the one where Ash is working at his chemistry school lab or where Ash and his cousin Kristofferson watch a train set in their room; these are incredibly hilarious, and speak of genius in each second of them. I think that, with the obvious superiority of Disney/Pixar's ""Up"", ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the second best family film of the year.See it! And have your children see it too. Films don't get any more rewarding than this! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my Top 10 favorite movies!,"When my friend told me that this was Wes Anderson's first animated film, I didn't believe him. This is the only other film from Wes Anderson that I consider to be a masterpiece. All of his movies are great but this one really wowed me! And this is my favorite from him, and my seventh favorite movie of all time.It's the closest that a movie has gotten to looking like a story book. More-so than Watership Down. This is due to the fact that this was the first time Wes Anderson presented his signature doll-housey style. Wes Anderson was faithful to Roald Dahl's book. And it's stop-motion animation.How Wes Anderson directed this movie was extremely clever. They didn't have the actors perform in booths. They had them outside using real farming equipment, etc.The animation is beautiful!Classic songs and songs made for the film help with the tone and are used well!The attention to detail is absolutely insane!The voice acting is amazing!The production design is flawless!The humor is clever!The characters are likable and memorable.The casting choices are perfect!The story is self-contained and simple but very fun!Even though the movie doesn't take it self seriously it produces genuine emotion, which is very impressive.And it flies by!The reason why this is my favorite from him is because Willem Dafoe is my second favorite actor, even though this is Wes Anderson's first animated film, he pulled it off extraordinarily well. And foxes are my favorite animal.Wes Anderson is truly one of the best directors working today, and is one of my personal favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I don't think there's a single thing about the movie I didn't like! Of course there could be the complaint that this movie wasn't much like the book, but I didn't mind that at all and I think that it kept all the unique quality that the book had.

Stop-Motion At Its Finest,"Forced to watch this movie as part of a school project after reading the book, I was not particularly looking forward to this one. I ended up liking it, however. I have a deep respect for stop-motion animators, not only because they laid the groundwork for the mind- blowing special effects of today, but also because of the countless hours they put into their work-- and it shows here.The best part of the movie is undoubtedly the animation; unless you're a huge Roald Dahl fan, that's the reason you're going to watch this. The film also has a star-studded voice cast and an enjoyable, if eccentric, score. The film almost certainly would have won Best Animated Feature if the near-flawless Up hadn't come out in the same year. Kids should be reasonably entertained, and adults will be charmed as well.On the negative side, the film adds to, shuffles around, and changes the source material drastically, but even the most die-hard fans of Dahl will admit that there wasn't a whole lot to turn into a feature-length film to begin with. Some of the additions work, and some definitely feel tacked-on and unnecessary. The film also markets itself as being ""hilarious,"" which it is not; it is occasionally humorous at best. There are also a few glaringly obvious CGI insertions at times, which take the viewer out of the experience a bit.Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fun family film with outstanding animation and plenty to entertain audiences with for its 87-minute run-time.

Creative Story,"Roald Dahl was well known for his fantasy stories which were Twilight Zone type of tales. Mr. Fox was one of his children's books. As the name implies, the lead is a fox. George Clooney is the voice of Mr. Fox and his wife, Felicity(Meryl Streep) get caught in a trap while stealing from a farm. He then becomes a newspaper writer, and moves his family to a house at the base of a tree, despite the warnings of his lawyer Badger(Bill Murray). The tree is close to the farms of Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, three very mean and ambitious men. After Fox steals food from their farms, they shoot at him but only blow his tail off. They also remove the tree above his den with a bulldozer. They wait at the entrance with guns for the animals to come out, and nearing starvation, Fox digs tunnels to the farms and takes more food. The farmers flood the tunnels and Fox and his neighbors are forced to live in a sewer. The battle with the farmers continues and Clooney's Mr. Fox leads the opposition to the very end. The animation is excellent, and although I' m not the biggest fan of cartoons, I was amused by The Fantastic Mr. Fox.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The members family test each other in trying times and find redemption in the end, though that is where the similarities end.The cinematography is rich and colourful, very Wes Andersonish (whatever that means).

"Only one word can describe this film...Fantastic! (I know, cheesy. Couldn't help it)","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great film. I wasn't sure about the film after seeing the trailers, but since trailers for Pixar films don't really get me that excited, I knew better than to let the trailer to scare me off. Glad I went to see it. It was touching, heart-warming, thrilling and, importantly, very funny. The other people in the theater with me were laughing at several of the jokes with me. The technical work and cinematography was great as well. The characters looked more realistic than most of the CG stuff I've seen (If the next words out of your mouth is ""No ****, Sherlock, it's real figures being photographed"" I don't blame you, I'm just saying, it's great. If the next words out of your mouth is ""No cuss, Sherlock, it's real figures being photographed"" you saw the film and you're a fan after my own heart). The fur was surprisingly well done.

We liked this movie a lot.,"Quick demographic (to let you know if you will relate to my review). I am in my early 30s, and my wife is in her late 20s. We are the parents of a typical 10 year old boy and a typical 7 year old girl (and a 2 month old baby, but he doesn't exactly watch movies at this point haha). We are all fairly well educated, but not excessively literary or critical. We watch plenty of movies, but we also miss lots of movies.Okay, we really really liked this movie. At first, I was worried because it seemed a little strange in the first few minutes. I was concerned about the animation, and the colors. I have never read any book related to this story, so I went with pretty much no other expectations. The movie is excellent. The character development is fantastic, the voices and voice acting were spectacularly done. The animation was really pleasant, and their funny little touches and attention to detail really make this an excellent movie.My kids also really enjoyed the show. There was plenty of humor, and true-to-life situational humor to keep you chuckling almost all the way through the show. But at the same time, you really find yourself liking the characters, even the bad guys.In a way, I feel that the show picked up on a lot of that which was good in early cartoons (like Bugs Bunny or Wile E Coyote), but in a modern, highly entertaining way. Not that this movie resembles those cartoons at all, because it doesn't ... just that there is an element to the humor that was used in those old shows that seems to be missing in most of the cartoons these days.We all enjoyed this movie, and ARE recommending it to everyone we know.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
From Art-House To Playroom,"A pleasurable children's film sometimes over-infused with adult sensibilities, ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" gives us plenty of charm and character, as well as a sense of director Wes Anderson poking a little fun at himself as noted art-house auteur.Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a retired fowl-thief who feels rather restricted by his new life as a newspaper columnist. When he moves to a new tree with his wife (Meryl Streep) and cub Ash (Jason Schwartzman), the prosperous farms of three mean humans prove too fat and juicy for him to ignore. But a life of crime has a downside, even for a fox as fleet and sly as the Fantastic Mr. F.As a director of wit and sophistication, Anderson may seem an unlikely candidate for bringing Roald Dahl's children's novel of forest- animal hi-jinks to screen. But Anderson has always had one foot in the water of lost childhood, and his treatment of the source material is clearly a labor of love.The film also benefits from the stop-action animation employed, giving it the feeling of one of those Rankin/Bass productions from the 1960s and 1970s. The film veers occasionally into twee territory working this vibe, but Anderson's usual directorial style of static compositions and tight close-ups seems a perfect match. At times, Anderson seems to play this up deliberately, pausing on a mealtime scene for one of Anderson's pregnant pauses, followed by the characters devouring their meals in wild-animal mode.The exchanges scripted by Anderson and Noah Baumbach also reflect this congruence:""They'll kill the children!""""Over my dead body they will.""""That's what I'm saying, you'll be dead, too, in that scenario.""""Well, I'm arguing against that.""Anderson's predilection for casting more actors than he has parts is evident here, too, but it kind of works. The usual gang of suspects, i. e. Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Wally Wolodarsky, etc., all provide sterling support as various animal characters, while Michael Gambon shines particularly as Mr. Bean, the nastiest of the human farmers.It's a more overtly comical offering than you usually get from Anderson. The school Ash goes to has a sign reading ""Co-Ed, All Species."" The word ""cuss"" is used as a substitute for a popular profanity, as in ""This is going to be a total cluster-cuss for everybody."" The humor may play a bit above the heads of little ones at times, but the message of accepting one's differences as strengths rather than weaknesses is cleverly developed. As morals go, it's a pretty good one.So is ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox."" At its best, which is often, it brings out the kid in you with its easy charm and pervading sense of wonder. It's not Anderson's greatest film, but it shows why he's worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is a piece of art,"I've probably seen it five times already. It's not about the story. It's the setup, the colours, the Wes Anderson's style of shooting scenes. It makes me feel the way I can't explain. It's art.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
So calming,"This movie is one of the most calming aesthetics I've ever seen. It also feels extremely mature for a children's movie while having nothing to scare kids away. The voice acting is really good, they sound very natural yet very calming. They also show emotion through the animation instead of with the voices. The comedy is really solid it feels very smoothly and nicely done. This movie just feels good to watch it's hard to explain but it just feels so relaxed while still having so much to it both from a storytelling point and character point. The storyline and character development is also surprisingly really deep and well done. Most important changes in character and inner thoughts are done through subtle dialogue or facial expressions and it makes the movie have a lot more weight to it. The music is also really well done. This is just simply a really good kids movie that I can easily recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best movies I have ever seen!!!!!!!!,"I don't have anything negative to say about this movie, except maybe I wish I could watch more of it. I don't know why this movie isn't more popular, maybe because it isn't a kids movie, but this is the best animated film I have ever watched, besides maybe Coraline. I have never read the books this film is based on, but if they are anything like the humor of this movie I want to. I would like to say Thank You to Wes Anderson for making me believe there are still good movies out there, that can still blow your mind from start to end. Many movies that start out well but have a horrible ending, I thought this would, but it ended in a great way. This is the kind of movie that I dream of seeing, and finally my dreams came true.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"More Quirky than Funny, but an easy watch","Fantastic Mr. Fox absolutely is hard to look away from when you start, as everything about it oozes style. The stop motion definitely has a bit of a stiff feel too it, in large part due to the materials used, but every scene is so dynamic and fun to observe all the little details.I wouldn't be surprised if viewers found this films aesthetics a little bit uncanny, but it would be fundamentally different if it looked more classily cute. I personally was not a fan of some of the music choices as well, but I believe that is personal taste.My biggest and only complaint with Mr. Fox is that it seldom ever made me laugh. I never stopped paying attention, I cracked a few smirks, but the lead character especially was not as charming to me as he likes to believe he is. The supporting characters steal the show.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A old-fashioned, stop-motion animation that was a delight to watch!!!!!","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a 2009 American stop-motion animated comedy film based on the Roald Dahl children's novel of the same name.The film features the voices of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon, and Owen Wilson.Mr. and Mrs. Fox live an idyllic home life with their son Ash and visiting young nephew Kristopherson. But after 12 years, the bucolic existence proves too much for Mr Fox's wild animal instincts. Soon he slips back into his old ways as a sneaky chicken thief and in doing so, endangers not only his beloved family, but the whole animal community. Trapped underground and with not enough food to go around, the animals band together to fight against the evil Farmers -- Boggis, Bunce and Bean -- who are determined to capture the audacious, fantastic Mr. Fox at any cost.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well, maybe not fantastic but definitely pretty good","I'll preface this review of Wes Anderson's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" by stating that I'm not really much of a fan of Mr. Anderson's films. For those who enjoy his work, though, this, despite being a bit of a departure, contains much of interest.The story (based on a Roald Dahl children's book) concerns the exploits of a group of anthropomorphic animals, principally a family of foxes. Mr. Fox is a reformed thief who's grown bored of his sedate lifestyle and is hankering for one last job. However, when he formulates a plan and puts it into practise he soon finds that the retaliation may be more than he can handle.George Clooney plays Mr. Fox and, while he does a good job, I have a thing against animated characters being voiced by instantly recognizable actors. In contrast, Meryl Streep & Jason Schwartzman are more reasonable choices and they both give good readings, especially Schwartzman, who gives the film's best performance in my opinion. Apart from these individuals, the cast includes Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Michael Gambon and others, all of whom turn in satisfactory performances.The script occupies a strange middle ground between a children's story and a story aimed at adults. Given this fact, I'm not surprised that the film barely made back half it's budget at the U.S. box office. I wouldn't recommend it for kids and I expect that the adult market for animation is pretty limited. Nevertheless, the script is more literate than usual for an American animated film, so therefore a welcome change of pace.Visually, the film is a sight to behold. The use of stop-motion animation sets it apart from most contemporary animated films and I really have to applaud Anderson's direction. Musically, the film is above average as well. Prominent use is made of ""Heroes and Villains"" (The Beach Boys), ""Street Fighting Man"" (The Rolling Stones) and, for the finale, the Bobby Fuller Four gem ""Let Her Dance"". None of it makes much sense in context but it's good to hear nonetheless.Ultimately, I think that ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a well-made animated film but likely one with a narrow audience. Like Wes Anderson's other films, this one seems like it was made to appeal mainly to fans of Wes Anderson films.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar did it better,"This is a solid movie and it is more aimed at adults, i personally gave it a 7/10I have watched and read the reviews and people say this is the greatest animated movie of all time and that it puts pixar at shame in the year 2009. I am here to tell you folks that yes this is a solid film but it is not as good as pixar in 2009. The story is simple, from the beginning it is like you know what is about to happen from the start and that isn't good.But this movie alone is not better than any pixar movie from 1995 to 2009I got a little pist when i saw this on the cover of the movie ""PROOF THAT PIXAR DOESN'T HAVE A MONOPOLY ON HEARTFELT AND FUNNY ANIMATION""Wich is just wrong at every level. This movie is not better than: wall-e, up, incredibles, nemo, monsters inc, cars or toy storyBut you know its a solid 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"We continue to care for the foxes in this film, even when they do get into deep cuss","I always thought it was a delight to see a director step out of their comfort zone and direct a film they usually don't touch. Kevin Smith did with Red State, Martin Scorsese does it every film, but one of his most noticeable was Hugo, and now, Wes Anderson takes his indelible quirkiness and injects it into the pleasant animated film, Fantastic Mr. Fox.I hope everyone at some point read a book by Roald Dahl, whether it was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, this, James and the Giant Peach, or The Witches. It seems almost all children were acquainted with his books at one point or another. Authors like that become etched into school curriculum. Joining Dahl can be the late Maurice Sendak, Beverly Clearly, or perhaps, for elementary-schoolers, the author of Holes and the Wayside series, Louis Sachar.Fantastic Mr. Fox presents us with the story of Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney), his wife, Felicity (Meryl Streep), and their twelve-year-old son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox is having a difficult time remaining collective since, well, he's a wild fox. Being that the tree that live in is very close to factories run by strict farmers and Mr. Fox has urges that desperately need to be fulfilled, him and his pal, Kylie Sven Opposum (Wallace Wolodarsky) decide they should try and steal produce from their farm. This becomes a recurring habit, and eventually leads to a war between the farmers and the burrowing foxes.The film is occupies a delightful elegance in its stop motion animation. Its characters, right down to the fur on their backs, are animated with rich and inviting colors, as well as the sets they live in clearly being meticulously detailed. The style is primitive and great to look at, and provides us with a different form of animated entertainment instead of Pixar, Dreamworks, and Disney monopolizing the field.One positive is that the film doesn't become buried under its own quirkiness so much so that we care little about the characters, which tends to happen in many of Wes Anderson's other pictures. What we have is a solid script, taken a step further than usual, along with big name actors subtly providing the voices behind these characters, so as not to throw in our face what big stars the movie has, and we continue to care for the foxes in this film, even when they do get into deep cuss.Voiced by: George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Eric Chase Anderson, Bill Murray, and Owen Wilson. Directed by: Wes Anderson.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Delightful,"Delightful. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a unique animated experience with all the quirkiness you would expect from Wes Anderson. I am not the biggest fan of stop-motion animation, but this captured my attention. The voice acting was great, with George Clooney perfectly cast.The plot was interesting and there were certain moments that I enjoyed. Wes Anderson is a talented director, and in the animated genre is no different. Was this the best animated movie that I have ever seen? No, but it was still pretty solid.

One Of The Best Movies Of 2009,"I was very much on the fence whether or not to bump this to a ten or not. It is really a marvelous film to see.After just the first few scenes I knew that this was a film that I would want to see again one day based solely on how it looked and all the different things going on. There really is so much to see and it seems impossible to take it all in with just one viewing. This film has a look to it that no other movie I can think of has. It's very fascinating to look at. I love the way that the fur subtly moved on the faces of the foxes; a very nice touch.The script is really neat too. Going into it, I was not really sure how this film would come out plot-wise, but I think it really turned out quite nicely. I have said in other reviews that Wes Anderson is my favorite director right now and this film definitely has his style and wit throughout.All the characters are quite interesting as well. One of my favorite scenes was the introduction of the three human villains. It is very memorable and the descriptions used were very impactful.This movie is not realistic, nor does it try to be. Things such as the height of the characters seems to change to fit the desired situation, but that is easily forgiven.This is a great movie for everyone to check out and to use a line that almost every critic has used: it truly is fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic Mr. Fox was not what I thought it was going to be.,"Looking at the front cover of the bluray, it looked to be cute, fun and super child friendly. It's fun, definitely. Cute? Sure. Super child friendly? No no no. Yes children can watch it but the screenplay was absolutely genius, they just wouldn't appreciate it. This was hilarious. Me laughing on multiple occasions is a rare achievement for any film, trust Wes Anderson and his quirky quirkiness to win me over. This is easily one of his strongest films, both in script and technical direction. His style is so unique and inventive that it's hard not to admire it. His centralisation of characters or objects in shots are just innovative, forcing the audience to become absorbed with what's on screen. Plenty of direct address to entice the viewer which I'm sure the younger audience will appreciate. But this screenplay. Genius. Masterful. Quotable. So many nice touches like substituting curse words with the word ""cuss"". Might go over children, but damn it made me laugh. ""What a cluster-cuss"". Ha! Only Anderson could pull that off in an animation. Every character had a unique and creative personality. Mr Fox was sly and suave, his son Ash was eccentric, nephew Kristofferson was perfect in every way, heck even Mrs Fox had some personality...she's a fully independent woman *click fingers in zig zag formation*. The voice casting choices were spot on. Clooney has that suave voice that suited Mr Fox, Streep has the power behind her voice for Mrs Fox. Schwartzman was the stand out, his line execution ensured laughter from viewers...so good! The only criticism I have is the soundtrack, some of the songs just didn't work for me and I think an original score would've suited the animation better. Oh, the stop motion work was tremendous. It's a dying art, so I can fully appreciate the time spent on a project like this. Overall, this took me by surprise. Honestly. I think older viewers will actually find more enjoyment due to the adventurous script. Can't wait to watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fantastic, Warm, Funny","I've not always responded well to Wes Anderson films - I think that's more about personal preference than a fault with him - but I found this more accessible than many of his others that I've seen to date. It felt like the ideal marriage of style and medium; the precision of the animation a good fit for Anderson's trademark attention to detail, and I laughed consistently throughout the film where usually with this director my amusement tends to lag in the second half. Lovely, warm, funny.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sorry. It's not perfect.,"I feel like the only person who isn't crazy about this. There's still a lot I love, the music is fantastic for one, obviously the leitmotifs are very prominent and absolutely amazing, I know I talk about leitmotifs lots but I don't know I love them. The instrumentation is so unique with the children's choir which is a leitmotif in itself and finger snapping. Rats theme is probably my favourite and Rat is probably my favourite character, Willem Dafoe's performance is great, all the performances are great.Now I have some nitpicks I want to mention. The scene when Bean's wife goes into the cellar doesn't make sense, she starts it by asking Bean how many ciders he wants, Bean asks for two, his wife then reminds him that he had three yesterday, he changes his mind and asks for three, then his wife decides to give him two anyway. Why would she remind him that he had three yesterday if she was only going to get him two anyway, it's not like they care about being healthy or anything like that, it's just annoying. My second nitpick is about the conversation behind the mineral deposit, it's a great scene, but something Mrs. Fox says is a bit unclear. She's says ""this story is too predictable"", a line I really like, Mr. Fox replies with ""how does it end"", she then says ""we all die, unless you change"", but even if he does change everyone's going to die, Mr. Fox changing doesn't change anything in regards to death in the grand scheme of things. And finally when Boris Bunce and Bean are stuck on the roof out of reach of Spitz Bean calls and asks for a ladder, but what will that do, Spitz is still going to be able to attack them if they get a ladder or not.Anyway those are my ""issues"", well they're not my issues but they're the ""issues"" I have with the film Fantastic Mr. Fox directed by Wes Anderson. Great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Charming and Witty Adaptation that Delights the Senses,"Wes Anderson's adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" is a delightfully charming and clever film that both kids and adults can enjoy. The stop-motion animation is stunning, and the voice acting by an all-star cast, including George Clooney, Meryl Streep, and Bill Murray, is superb.The story follows the cunning Mr. Fox, who, despite promising his wife he would give up his thieving ways, cannot resist the temptation to steal from three local farmers. What follows is a hilarious game of cat and mouse, as the farmers attempt to catch Mr. Fox and his family, and Mr. Fox uses his wits to outsmart them at every turn.What really sets this film apart is Anderson's signature style, which infuses the story with a quirky humor and a distinct visual aesthetic. The attention to detail in the animation is astounding, with every character and object imbued with a unique personality and charm.Overall, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a whimsical and delightful film that captures the spirit of Roald Dahl's original book, while also adding its own unique flair. It's a must-see for fans of both Anderson and Dahl, and a film that will leave you with a warm and fuzzy feeling long after it's over.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic Might Be an Overstatement,"Pretty much exactly how I imagined a stop-motion Wes Anderson movie to turn out. The first two acts are really clever, genuine and quirky, then the third drags on forever. Anderson pulled in his usual cast of characters (really, has he made a film without Owen Wilson, Bill Murray and / or Jason Schwartzman?) but they once again pull a miracle by feeling right at home in the new characters' skins, and the new additions fit right in alongside them. George Clooney was perfect as the slightly shady, endlessly charismatic lead, Willem Dafoe has a great cameo as one of the villains and everyone else's performance seems to key off that energy. I re-watched The Life Aquatic With Zissou a few months back and enjoyed it much more on my second viewing, which is consistent with most of Anderson's movies for me, and fully expect this one to get better with repeat viewings, as well. Even bearing that in mind, it was mostly charming and truly entertaining as a goofball throwback to the old school the first time through.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unashamedly childish fun,"Wes Anderson's adaptation of Roahl Dahl's book of the same name casts aside the CGI animation of Pixar for some old-school stop-motion animation. It tells the familiar story of the cheeky Mr. Fox (voiced with the usual charm of George Clooney) who leaves his days of stealing chickens behind him to marry Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) and settle down with their newly born son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). After buying up some new property that is situated near the land of Boggis, Bunce and Bean, three farmers with a terrible reputation, Mr. Fox is tempted into his old ways. He plans the heist of the century (in fox terms) to hit each farm individually without getting a scratch, aided by his lovable-but- dumb friend Badger (Bill Murray), and eventually his visiting nephew and natural athlete Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson).When the farmers discover what Mr. Fox is up to, Franklin Bean (Michael Gambon) unites the three and plans a revenge attack on Fox's burrow. Soon, Mr. Fox has to team up with his own gang of rather hopeless animals to escape the tractors that have begun digging up their home. They also have to face Bean's cider-loving, knife-wielding, finger- snapping bodyguard Rat (Willem Dafoe). Feeling guilty for the situation he has placed his family and friends into, Mr. Fox must come up with a plan to defeat the persistent farmers.Anderson's sense of humour that has been so present in his previous films is in full flow here. Clooney can deliver a quirky line like no other actor working in cinema today and his time working with the Coen brothers have clearly paid off. Mr. Fox is selfish, cocky and obnoxious, but with Clooney behind the microphone he is a completely lovable character. The quirkiness is upped by the presence of Anderson regulars Murray and Schwartzman, whose personalities shine through the animation and give their clay characters an important human feel. Michael Gambon also has a field day voicing the sadistic and psychopathic Bean, who in his own way is absolutely hilarious.Anderson's decision to go with stop-motion animation adds a nostalgic edge to the film. The book is clearly beloved to the director, and to many people who have read this or any of the number of children's classics by Roahl Dahl. I remember reading Matilda, James And The Giant Peach and The BFG as a child in school and being fascinated and enthralled, and Fantastic Mr. Fox brought those memories back. Of course, the film's sense of humour is not in tone with the book, but the overall feel and charm of the film really captures the spirit of Dahl's books. The opening heist has Mr. Fox ingeniously navigate his way through a farmyard in the style of Super Mario Brothers. It is super- charged, throwing reason and continuity out the window for the sake of having some immature fun, and it works.Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, Anderson's two greatest films, were two of the best American comedies to come out in recent years, and Fantastic Mr. Fox adds something different and equally impressive to an already-impressive CV. It also cements his status as a director whose films you can always look forward to. The film's giddiness and unashamed childishness elevates the film, and it's nice to see a children's story adapted without the need for flashy effects or feeling the need to darken the tone. Highly recommended.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Disappointment,"I went into this film knowing nothing more about it other than it received good reviews both here at IMDb and with some other film critics I hear from time to time. I knew nothing of it being Roald Dahl and I still haven't looked up what Wes Anderson has done before. Perhaps this was my mistake.The animation was amateur, the plot either nearly non-existent or perhaps (to be fair) just far too subtle for me but if that is the case, I don't think kids will get it. The characters were annoying and mostly pretty unpleasant. The morals are also at least questionable as the lead character lies, steals, kills without expecting repercussions. When these repercussions occur, they affect not only him but all those around and he remains unrepentant.In short, I am wondering how people thought this was a good film.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Even better rewatch,"Wes cussing Anderson. After 12 years of bucolic bliss, Mr. Fox (George Clooney) breaks a promise to his wife (Meryl Streep) and raids the farms of their human neighbors, Boggis, Bunce and Bean. Giving in to his animal instincts endangers not only his marriage but also the lives of his family and their animal friends. When the farmers force Mr. Fox and company deep underground, he has to resort to his natural craftiness to rise above the opposition.I watched this movie as a kid so long ago and noticed that I don't remember anything from it. So i decided to give it a rewatch and i really didn't regret that. The movie keeps you hooked from start to finish. With a runtime of 1 hour and 27 minutes, there's never a dull moment. Whether it's Mr. Fox's daring heists, the quirky animal characters, or the clever dialogue, something exciting is always happening on screen. The film is also extremely funny. The humor extends beyond just the dialogue; it's also part of the animation itself. The characters' expressions and their interactions also contribute to the film's charm. Additionally, the animation style is a feast for the eyes. The stop-motion technique gives the film a unique texture, and the attention to detail is remarkable. Wes Anderson's signature visual style shines through, making it a treat for both kids and adults. George Clooney's voice fits Mr. Fox's character flawlessly. But the entire voice cast from Bill Murray, to Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, and many others also deserve applause.Whether you're revisiting it or watching it for the first time, this film is a delightful experience that leaves you with a smile.Score:8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of the best animated films I've ever seen,"I absolutely love Fantastic Mr. Fox! It's an excellent animated movie. From the clever comedic writing to the great casting for the voices of the characters to the masterful animation technique. Meryl Streep, George Clooney, and Bill Murray's voices all match up with their characters very well, it just works. The writing is a very dry humor, it's not obvious at all, which is the kind of humor I love, some very young children may not quite understand all the lines and the comedy in them since it's not obvious humor, but older kids and adults certainly will. I don't get to see this kind of animation a lot, but I'm so glad this well made film used this kind because it's very fascinating to look at. The film switches between the animals and what they're doing to the humans and what they are plotting to do about the animals. Young children will like the action related scenes, and the older kids/adults will love the dialogue exchanges and the clever script. 10/10 for Fantastic Mr. Fox!

Memorably Joyous,"This is easily Wes Anderson's finest film. I've enjoyed his films in the past but I never thought any of them were truly 'fantastic'! But, this one is extremely amusing, mesmerizing, and an absolute joy to watch.Much will likely be made of the quality of special effects. Yet, that will dramatically miss the point of this great film. The actors voices are perfect for their characters. But, regardless of the actors or special effects, what ultimately makes a movie rise above others (as evidenced by the greatness of the first three Star Wars films, for example, as opposed to the droll final three) is writing and dialog.The combination of Anderson's best dialog of any film he's written or directed with excellent interpretation and the great original story line from Roald Dahl and voilà - a fantastic film about a fantastic fox.This simply has not been a banner year for films. In fact, there haven't been many great movies in recent years (one wonders - did all the writers simply quit permanently?).

"Good adaptation, but not great","As many already know, the movie extends beyond the original Roald Dahl's story. In general the adaption and extensions are very good and true to the original narrative. There was definitely a certain intrigue when the movie continued where the story would be already finished. It has delivered and I still recommend the movie as watchable.The main reason why I don't give this adaptation 100% may be my personal opinion. I don't think the weird kid Ash (one of the add-ons that doesn't exist in the original story) really fits in. I happened to be fully up-to-date over the last several years on Roald Dahl due to a growing child in the family and re-reading/re-listening to most of his ""PG-13"" books. I can definitely tell you that a weird main character child is NOT typical of Roald Dahl. Yes, corky weirdness is a trademark of Roald Dahl, but it is applied to adults and kids antagonists. Thus, Ash really sticks out as a sore thumb in the adaptation and takes away from the main narrative of Mr Fox himself. All other characters and visuals are great.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
HUGE disappointment,"I am watching this as I type and can only say it is an abomination. When I was a teacher I read this excellent Roald Dahl story to my class of 8 year olds every year and it was loved by all of them, so much so that I sometimes had to read it twice to the same class within the year. My beef(s) with this film are as follows 1. This movie bore little resemblance to the book apart from the names of the characters. 2. The whole thing was americanised. 3. This was sit-com material. 4. It was boring as hell. Things I liked were as few and far between I enjoyed the sound of Clooney's voice and Meryl's too, but they should have been given a much better script. I like quirky and have no real problems with creative adaptations but this was poor on almost every level. Wes Anderson should be ashamed of himself.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mr. Fox: A Whimsical Adventure into the World of Wes Anderson,"Wes Anderson, known for his distinctive filmmaking style, takes audiences on a whimsical journey with ""Fantastic Mr. Fox."" Released in 2009, this stop-motion animated film is an adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's book of the same name. Anderson's unique blend of humor, quirkiness, and visual aesthetics is on full display in this delightful tale of a cunning fox and his adventures in the animal world.The story revolves around Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney), a charismatic and clever fox with a penchant for thievery. Tired of his current life, Mr. Fox decides to embark on a daring spree of stealing from three wealthy farmers - Boggis, Bunce, and Bean - leading to a series of comical and thrilling events. As the narrative unfolds, Mr. Fox's actions have far-reaching consequences, testing his wit and courage as he seeks to outsmart his adversaries and protect his family and friends. The plot is filled with humorous dialogues and unexpected twists, creating an engaging experience for both children and adults. Anderson's signature dry wit and deadpan humor contribute to the film's charm, making it a delightful watch for viewers of all ages. All though the jokes can be loved by all, there are some jokes in the movie that might fall short.The film's setting is a picturesque and idyllic countryside, complete with rolling hills, lush forests, and charming burrows. The attention to detail in the stop-motion animation brings the world to life, creating a visually stunning backdrop for the characters' escapades. Anderson's meticulous design choices, from the characters' wardrobes to the intricate miniature sets, contribute to the film's overall aesthetic appeal. There can be times in the film with a lot of open space and might feel empty at points but not very often.The juxtaposition of the quaint animal world against the looming threat of the three farmers adds depth to the setting, creating a sense of tension and excitement. The film successfully captures the essence of Dahl's original work while infusing it with Anderson's distinctive visual style.

Pleasantly Outfoxed,"My spouse, more than I, loves to see kid's movies. We'd seen the preview of Fantastic Mr. Fox at the theater and I groaned at the thought of having to sit through it My impression was the animation was stiff and outdated. The color was so reddish brown it seemed ""off"" as though the film was faded. Still, we eventually ran out of movies we wanted to see and ended up at this one. Boy, what a pleasant surprise! I had seen Gene Shalit review it the other day and he sure didn't give it raves. Critics don't phase me much but I was already doubtful. In the end, I can't promise everyone will enjoy it as much as we did. It depends on your sense of humor re: what you think is funny. However, for us it had at least two ""laugh out loud"" moments, spontaneous laughs where you even surprise yourself. The music, the characters, the setting, are all offbeat in a way that suits this story. I loved the personalities. The rat was hilarious and this was one entertaining movie. Kids will probably enjoy it but I can't imagine that they'll enjoy it as much as adults. You won't be checking the time on your cell phone in this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not recommended for kids,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is not a bad movie. It is a bit like Ocean's Eleven only animated, which means it is okay but nothing to get too excited about. While the movie has several shortcoming, its main problem is that it is not for kids. While many animated movies contain content for adults to keep them from getting completely bored while catering mostly for the target audience - that is, kids - this movie is for adults only and kids (and by that I mean anyone under 14) will likely get bored. The story is too complex for kids to follow and there is no real action to speak of that will get kids excited. I sum, it is an okay grown-up movie for the DVD but nothing more.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unexpected surprise from this masterpiece,"It's my first review, despite having watched a lot of movies. This movie made me finish it and go review it immediately. A movie that's less than an hour and a half long and offers all this creativity!!When I decided to watch this movie as an
evening movie before going to sleep, I was not expecting anything new from it, but I was amazed by the amount of creativity and dedication in this work. It is complete in every aspect. It is very entertaining and grabs your attention. It is suitable for adults and children, which makes it Which makes it suitable for family viewing. It takes you smoothly through its chapters and you want more, and it does not spare you anything at the end.

One more good stop-motion animated comedy,"Overall, Wes Anderson has an interesting unique style, but for some reason I only like his stop-motion animated movies! I can appreciate his movies, but I only really enjoy his puppet cartoons! Their unsurpassed humor and interesting hidden meanings resonate with my sense of beauty. I can't explain it: for some reason, the films directed by him don't reach me. And about Fantastic Mr. Fox I can say that I will rewatch this piece more than once. Maybe becouse I like this genre, i watched Chicken Run for many times in my childhood. So I think it returns me in that happy times. I especially liked the design of the animals. I would gladly mint a similar NFT! Maybe I will do so when IGUverse finally launch their application!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
a complete waste of time to watch especially if you are not American,"I was personally expecting this film as a competitor for my favorite animations. However it turned out to be a complete disappointment. I was definitely bored from the beginning to the end. There was probably some of American humor that I didn't get at all. The script was nothing special, including all the Hollywood family clichés of unhappy marriage, problem child etc. I could hardly laugh at most in a couple of scenes. I'm not an expert in animation techniques and this movie might have brought something new in that aspect however, there was not a bit of creativity in story telling especially when compared to Miyazaki animations or even Toy Story and Wall-E. I did not even understand why the director made a movie like this. I want to forget it as soon as possible.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Rohld Dahl and Wes Anderson = WIN,"I loved the book Fantastic Mr Fox, I love dry humour. The combination was just perfect, it was like what would have really happened if Roald Dahl had added all the tiny intricacy's of fox family life. This is film making at its best, no shiny bells and whistles, just take a story and expand on it and bring it to life. Roald Dhal would have been proud because he was a pretty warped man with a dry sense of humour. There was so much to see in this film, tiny details that if u blink you would miss. The hilarity of them digging and the premise of their lifestyle as wild animals is just genius and just works. Wes Anderson just tells story's how they should be told, there is a reality to his work that separates his films from all the trash that you usually watch. Its the sort of thing that wouldn't work with every film but when he gets it right it works so well. I have to give this an 8/10 for originality, style and overall humour. I will most definitely buy this on DVD and sit and watch after a night out with friends. I can't say that about many other Wes Anderson films.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Everyone is a little ""Different""","Wes Anderson's 2009 film, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a stop motion animated film that reminds us that there is nothing wrong with being different.The stop animation is nothing short of fantastic in this film because it is very fluid. Wes Anderson demonstrates how precise the stop motion picture is when Mr. Bean begins flailing his arms and knocking things from shelves, ultimately destroying his office space. However, the expressions that the Foxes are molded in to can make one feel a little unsettled, to say the least. When Mr. Fox finds out they are going to have a son he gives his wife an unconvincing grin by baring all of his sharp teeth. The stop-animation can be unsettling, but I believe that in this situation Wes Anderson is trying to emphasize that Mr. Fox is processing that he is going to have a son, so his character looks strained.Wes Anderson uses his characters and witty dialog to remind adults and children alike that it's okay to be different, no matter the context behind it. Throughout the film, characters such as the Fox's son Ashe, Mrs. Fox, and Kylie are referred to or refer to themselves as being ""different."" The animals in the film do a funny hand gesture when the word ""different"" is said or implied to emphasize that many things make one ""different."" I believe that Wes Anderson intended to remind the audience that what we feel makes us different is nothing to be ashamed about because ""different"" is never defined in this film. Being different could be approached positively as embracing your own ""self,"" which happens to be the case if you pay attention to Kylie's character.Kylie is an opossum who has primal instincts that symbolize anxiety and being different in Fantastic Mr. Fox. This opossum is introduced to us when Mr. Fox is looking at a new home and see's the handyman, Kylie. We get the idea that Kylie is ""different"" because his eyes spin when he feels the need to defend himself, or is put in situations where he could become anxious. Kylie is considered ""different,"" because he plays dead due to his species. Opossums play dead to protect themselves because they are a prey animal. Kylie could be considered zoning out or differentiating in a human versus animal context which relates to mental health and representation of anxiety in Fantastic Mr. Fox.While the target audience was intended for children, I find that Fantastic Mr. Fox can appeal to young adults as well because many of us struggle to accept what is ""different"" about us individually.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic,"Before starting with the criticism of the movie I would like to emphasize something, this movie is not like the others.Starting with the criticism, this animated movie is a clear example of how not to bore and entertain the viewer, it is fast, spontaneous, therefore totally enjoyable.Compared to many current movies, this one acts very quickly and is not boring, totally recommendable, a solid 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Patient, Kid-Friendly, Character-Driven Romp","Wes Anderson and Roald Dahl meet in the middle for this eccentric, free-spirited interpretation of an early 1970s short story. I'll admit to not being a fan the first time I saw this, years ago, but upon a second viewing (now a parent, watching it with my kids) I can better appreciate it. As I've become more familiar with Mr. Dahl since that time, I found the author's calling cards more obvious, a close match for the director's idiosyncratic directing style and obsessive attention to detail.Stuffed with small character moments and a warm, soft pace, it operates with an unusual cadence that takes time and effort to accept. The voice acting is star-studded and mostly effective, particularly George Clooney's turn as the smooth-talking lead with a taste for one last heist, though the actors do often get caught up by the constant long-winded, dry, breathless dialog. Many supporting players sound positively bored by that process. The animation fits the tone quite well, using stop-motion puppets that closely resemble a set of well-loved kids' toys, and that helps give the screen a familiar, welcoming atmosphere. Like walking through the door to your old childhood bedroom, twenty years on. It's a worthwhile alternative to today's louder, flashier fare.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, frenetic film","'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' takes Wes Anderson's quirky directing style and applies it to animation. All the classic Anderson elements are there (relentless symmetry, wide shots with tiny elements of motion, laconic dialogue punctuated with pauses, etc), but in this case, all is acted out by stop-action, animal models. The result is a great animated 'action' film – a little dark at times (as befits a Roald Dahl story), but otherwise enjoyable by all ages. Marquee voice talent adds a lot to the wandering story of a fox (and father) dealing with his family and friends, and the disastrous consequences of his compulsion to steal from the local cabal of farmers. Much of the fun is in the details, so watch closely. The music (especially the children's chant motif) and the visualisation of the most 'psychotic' of the three nasty farmers adds a lot to the pleasingly grim-lite mood of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A plain entertainment,"I enjoy the direction style of Wes Anderson and his animation movies are also different as they try to show a story in a way which is different from other directors.I never had plan to watch this movie but today, I decided to give it a watch.

The direction was good and the screenplay was also good but the ending felt bland to me. Yes, it was a happy ending but it could be more elevated. The story is to the point, it isn't dragged.Overall, it is a good children entertainment and you should try it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Typical Wes Anderson quirkiness, this time in stop-action.","Even though Fantastic Mr. Fox was a stop-action movie allegedly meant for children, you could still tell undeniably that it was a Wes Anderson production. It's fair to say that throughout the years Anderson (who is only 40!) has garnered a strong cult following (other notable films of his include: The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Darjeeling Limited). Though his movies are often offbeat and a bit funky, I think they pack a lot of heart. They give a perhaps skewed yet sincere perspective on the world and on basic human relationships. Since I'm a sucker for strange movies, I'm a fan; I have a lot of respect for his interesting, unique style and I was pleased that Fantastic Mr. Fox kept the same feel.One of the most obvious reasons Fantastic Mr. Fox is similar to his other movies, is that the same ever-present group of Anderson's favorite actors made their appearances (albeit in cartoonish animal form this time): Bill Murray as a badger-lawyer, a Wilson brother (Owen this time) as a gym coach, and Jason Schwartzman as Mr. Fox's son, Ash. These friends help make Anderson's movies what they are and I can't imagine not having them.In a similar vein, I was impressed by the number of other big names doing voices (George Clooney, Meryl Streep, William Dafoe, Michael Gambon AKA Dumbledore). This probably points to the fact that Anderson is getting a lot of street cred in Hollywood these days, as he deserves, and people are really taking him seriously. Though I'm sure everybody in LA has known he's a genius from the very beginning.As far as dialogue goes, Fantastic Mr. Fox retained Anderson's subtle humor and cool-headed/almost passive/laid-back observations of life. How can I explain this? Sentences are short and super-condensed. They are to the point. There were many quirky obsessions, like the word ""cuss."" Though naturally there was action and drama, the way the characters talk makes it seem like everything is under control. Or maybe it's that all his characters have resigned to the fact that life is life and we can't change things. Do we take it seriously or can we laugh at it? Both maybe:Ash: You should probably put your bandit hat on now. Personally, I- I don't have one, but I modified this tube sock. Kristofferson: You look good. Ash: Yeah, I do.Finally, even though it was via a new medium, the movie maintained Anderson's interesting way of shooting scenes. I may also lack an accurate way of describing it, but I certainly know it when I see it. His shots are slow and the camera stays in one place and lets the small things happen. In a way, we see things in the same way his characters talk- quiet/still.Which brings me to another interesting point about this movie: Stop-action animation. The eyes of the characters were strange. It felt like the color scheme was brown and orange, making it seem straight from the 70's. Most films using this medium are meant for children. And, although there were lots of kids in the theater, I'm not so sure they connected with this story as much as they would, say a Disney movie. I think lots of the subtleties of the dialogue and many of the jokes were lost on them.The story was amusing and felt like an old fashioned fable with a lesson involved (something the kids may have been able to pick up on): don't be greedy. Also, be yourself. So, I for one enjoyed watching this movie, quirks and all.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wes Anderson goes to extreme measures to add unsurpassed detail!,"A childhood favorite is turned into a movie masterpiece by an loving fan, Wes Anderson. Fantastic Mr. Fox is elegantly directed, animated, and performed. After many years of imagining what the film could be Wes Anderson partnered up with Revolution Studios to make a stop start animation. An ambitious fox and his family's journey that led them from a hole to the wrong side of three farmers guns is turned to a captivating story by Wes and his team. Wes Anderson goes to extreme measures to add unsurpassed detail to make Fantastic Mr. Fox a special experience for all viewers.Fantastic Mr Fox is a uniquely animated film, nothing like any other movie you have ever seen. It is made similar to countless classics using stop start animation, a technique only used by directors and animators with tremendous care and preparation. The animal figurines designed and meticulously shaped by various specialist ranging from people who designed the clothes to people that engineered the many pliable metal plates that go into the face and joints of each figurine. All of the figurines were designed and constructed the same except for the bunny and mouse, who were made custom due to the bunnies' large ears and the mices' small stature. Mr. Fox has his tail shot off by a farmer out to get revenge. His son makes a noble attempt to steal back the tail, being used a a tie by the farmer. While in the farmers there is a moment where the Ash, the son, pauses giving the viewer and opportunity to study the set. The wood grain and small trinkets scattered about are a great example. The detail shown in the house shows that Henry Selick, the animation director, did not just want the job done. He wanted the job done right.Even though the film is animated; nothing feels flat: texture and depth is added at all possible stops. The set designers do a wonderful job of adding tremendous character to all of the senses. By using tints, hues, and tones to shade and highlight the background, the animator helps provide a sense of realness to the film. For example, the animators add emotion throughout the sewer scene toward the end where all of the animals are crammed into a tight space. They do so by layering various blues, blacks, and greys symbolizing sadness and a loss of hope. The white flickering light in the halls adds a sense of false security. For a few seconds every thing is lit up, the second the light goes out the unone is suddenly a major threat. After suffering in the sewer Mr. Fox finds a grocery with a sewer opening in an isle. His family enters the store and the scene is immediately filled with bright colors: reds, yellows, white light, ect. These colors symbolize a new found sense of hope and happiness. Going from dark to light symbolizes beginning a new chapter in life. Revolution Studios did a great job making an intriguing set that any viewer can appreciate.Unlike many other directors who use personification, Wes Anderson makes an effort to add a wild spirit to a humanized natural predator. He is portrayed as a father, a husband, and a writer: not a wild animal. After being served breakfast he mutilates his food without ever glancing towards the silverware. Foxy being savage rather than sophisticated is ironic because it shows his true nature, wild and free. Nothing like the friendly and human like facade he puts on. In the next scene Mr Fox is house shopping. He is tired of living a boring life, having to crawls out of a hole every morning. Hoping to expand,Mr. fox contemplates moving in to a real, above ground house. He is led to a captivating tree by his realtor. Some of the selling points sound oddly familiar but with a twist: original dirt floors, great neighborhood, and conveniently located near a chicken farm. This wich to move illustrates Wes Anderson's urge to create a relatable scenario while the ""original dirt floors"" reminds us that Mr. Fox is an animal, a fox, sort of just a prop.Wes Anderson's attention to detail makes is clear that he cared tremendously about the viewing experience and the quality of the final product. Every aspect of the preparation and recording process was done for the same reason, to make a powerful film. With Wes Anderson and his team there is no stone left unturned.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Quirky Animated Feature,"Roald Dahl is an incredible children's author and his books are very British affairs, with a bit of his Norwegian backgrounds and legends thrown in. So it was worry that one of his novels was being turned into a American film, with an American director and cast. But fortunately it is a good film.Mr. Fox (George Clooney) is a successful hunter and poacher of farm animals and he has amazing abilities avoiding traps. But when his wife, Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) is pregnant, Mr. Fox gives up his hunting ways for his family. Two Years later (twelve fox years), Mr. Fox is bored with his life so decides to go for one last big score, robbing the three meaning farmers in the valley, Boggis, Bunce and Bean. But by robbing them Bean (Michael Gambon) leads the farmers one a hunt, doing everything they can to kill Mr. Fox and his family. Whilst this adventure and heist is going on, Mr. Fox's son Ash (Jason Schwartzman) develops a rivalry with his cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson) because of his intelligence and athletic ability and Mr. Fox ending up favouring him over his own son.The director Wes Anderson is one of the darlings of American indie cinema. He wrote and shot Fantastic Mr. Fox almost like an indie film, particularly the family drama about a son trying to prove himself to his father and a man (or this case a fox) having to fight against his nature. The way some of the sequences are shot and move reminded me of classic platformer games, particularly Sonic the Hedgehog and the undergrounds scenes showing the network of tunnels was like the first version of Worms.Fantastic Mr. Fox works as a heist film with Mr. Fox coming up with plans to rob the farmers, who is arrogant about his abilities and ignores his family because of his exploits. They is a lot of humour in the film involving the lines and dialogue and some visual gags: but this was not a film that does not have as much appeal to young children as it should have. There are still gags that children will like though. A running gag in the film is Bean giving orders over a walkie-talkie. There is a fight between Mr. Fox and Rat (Willem Dafoe) which was skilfully done when they are jumping up in the air in the darkness with lightening flashing so it was quick still images.The animation style is style and on the trailers it did look weak. But it worked in the film; the designs of all the animals and humans are detailed and I do have a soft-spot for stop-motion animation. Stop-motion allows for more real world physic and detailed characters and set designs, like the painting of the badgers. The movement is fluid, like in the platformer style sequences, but other scenes were crude and not that well done, like the digging, the flooding and the dancing looked like a student film working on a limited budget . One thing I also don't understand is why the animals are American (i.e, opossums and beavers) let the town looks like an old fashioned English town.Wes Anderson shot the film almost like a live action film, obviously directing how he knows best. It just small touches like the way the camera zooms into towards a face or the wide shots, giving the film a extra in it's cinematography.There is an excellent voice cast and both Wes Anderson and Spike Jonze with Where the Wild Things Are actually got their voice actors together and performed the film and get a more natural performance out the actors. The traditional way is for the actor to stand in a room and say the line in about 25 different ways with the director and editor picks the best version. Many of the actors in Fantastic Mr. Fox are natural comic performances and many of them had good chemistry. Clooney leads the film well and Bill Murray and Wallace Wolodarsky had a very good, funny supporting roles.Finally there is a good soundtrack in this film, with songs from the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, to banjo music and the playful score by Alexandre Desplat.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Ultimate Family Movie,"When I first saw a cardboard advertisement for Fantastic Mr. Fox at my local theater back in 2009 my eyes lit up. A bunch of cartoon animals doing something or other? Count me in! I begged my mom to take me to it, and after a lot of begging she took me to see it. My first viewing of this movie was far from critical. I merely saw funny talking animals, wearing clothes and interjecting actual curse words with the word ""Cuss"". It was good time for my eight year old self.I was only slightly familiar with the works of Roald Dahl at the time. My elementary school library only had a modest selection of his work. Neither did I know who Wes Anderson was. Im not even sure I understood what a director for a movie did at the time. However, they both came together to create a film that has stuck with me to this very day.The story of Fantastic Mr. Fox is its strongest point by far. From a child's perspective, you have a roguish fox seeking to challenge three mean farmers for a chance to recapture the glory from his youth and then him subsequently dealing with the consequences of his actions. From an adult's perspective, you get themes of legacy, mistrust and pondering the question ""What does it mean to be a family man""? Allow me to elaborate.At the beginning of the film we have the loving and thieving fox duo of Mr. Fox and Felicity Fox. After a squab heist gone wrong, Felicity reveals she is pregnant with their child. After this revelation, Mr. Fox is thrilled but is reluctantly forced to give up his thieving lifestyle to take care of his newborn. Flash forward to two years later, and we see Mr. Fox living the family man life, obviously unfulfilled. And after learning of not one but three mean, nasty and ugly farmers with goods ripe for the stealing, he wants to get the last hoorah he was never able to have.This main storyline of the film I feel is evident of a man's innate nature for striving for glory and legacy and what he would do to get it, even if it comes at the cost of his family. What will a man be remembered for when he is gone? That is the question Mr. Fox has on his mind as he approaches the ripe old fox age of seven. Will he be remembered as a nobody newspaper columnist? Or one of, if not the greatest thief of all time.Women and mothers watching the film I feel can relate to Felicity. Being the unwilling participant and victim of Mr. Fox's escapades, I feel like Felicity is a cry from women everywhere about the sometimes self destructive nature of men. Why aren't I enough? Why isn't our child enough? Do we not make you happy enough? It's a reasonable plea.Thankfully, I feel like Mr. Fox realizes this (although only after his actions produce severe consequences for him, his family and his whole community) towards the end of the movie. Sparing movie spoilers, there's two heartfelt scenes in which Mr. Fox first tells Felicity and then his son Ash that he is sorry and what they mean to him.Speaking of his son Ash, older kids can relate all too well to his character even if the dialogue written for the character is something a kid of that age would never say. A young kid who is a little bit of an oddball and idolizes the steep accomplishments of his father and sees them as standards to live to. Spurred on by the raw talent of his cousin Kristofferson, he tries to seek validation from his father that ""He's good enough"". Validation that I feel he gets both from the aforementioned dialogue and from finally living up to his dads expectations through his actions.And lastly we come to Cousin Kristofferson. A fish out of water most obviously noted by Wes Anderson's color usage, Kristofferson relates to a kids sense of belonging and feelings of isolation. And while not as fleshed out as a character as some of the others, he is still a great supporting arch of the story as a whole.All of these characters resonate with the audience, whether you share the same demographics of them or not. And yes, the movie does feel a little sloppy at the end with continuity errors and tiny plot holes. But this story, wrapped up neatly with a bow of Wes Anderson's first foray into stop motion animation and his beautiful use of colors truly is a cinematic feast for anybody who watches it, young or old. And with it also being an unofficial thanksgiving movie, I hope to one day establish a tradition of sitting down with my family every holiday season and enjoying this film with them.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not as polished as other stop-motion films, but lots of fun","(www.plasticpals.com) Wes Anderson's trademarked balance of comedy and character study shines through in this stop-motion animated adaptation of Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox. I was a pretty big fan of Dahl's work as a boy, but somehow this fox escaped me. Anderson's voice cast includes George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon, and his old mainstays Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe, Owen Wilson, and Jason Schwartzman. Despite the big names the film never feels like a Hollywood product thanks to its distinctly hand-crafted look, which eschews the near-CG perfectionism of recent stop-motion films like Coraline.From the first trailer I saw, I felt something about it was a bit off. The anthropomorphic animals' matted fur twitches from the animators' unseen manipulations, creating the effect of a taxidermist's nightmare.This slightly disturbing quality isn't as much of an issue once you settle into it, but is somewhat cringe-worthy in close-ups. That said, the animators were given free reign to push the boundaries of cartoon physics and speed, resulting in highly energetic scenes. Unfortunately, the illusion is broken in a few of the film's scenes due to a lack of fluidity.The story is a charming one. When he moves next to the farms of Boggis Bunce and Bean, Mr. Fox can't help but break a promise to his wife never to steal again. His escapades don't go unnoticed by the farmers, who will stop at nothing to take revenge. Meanwhile, Mr. Fox's son must deal with an unwanted rival in nearly all aspects of life when his talented taller cousin comes to stay with them. The farmers go nuts, all hell breaks loose, and soon all the animals in the area become threatened.Of course, many hilarious hijinks are had throughout, not to mention when Mr. Fox rallies the rest of the animals for one final showdown, winner take all. More so than most animated films, I feel like this one can be enjoyed more by the adults in the audience than the children (judging from the howls of laughter in the cinema).It's a classic, funny tale and great fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fantastic Mr Fox,"Vivid colors, story and characters.This is one of my all time favorite animated films, every scene pays such attention to detail it just makes every moment worthwhile. The story is amazing, perfectly paced, engaging and gives an understandable and genuinely interesting backstory. Alongside the amazing backstory is creative unique music tying everything together creating this harmonious atmosphere which is just a pleasure to watch. Every character plays a role and adds a bit of themselves to the story, whether it's the wonders of Mr Fox or the temper of the farmers everything is intertwined. The film conveys how instinct stays with you, you can't help it, it's a part of you, but it also shows how sometimes embracing instinct is the key to living a fulfilling life. The farmers Boggis, Bunce and Bean represent humanity, how they destroy nature and their cruel ways of doing so, the film shows how their selfishness and ambitions inevitably lead to their downfall. I also really enjoyed how the movie showed family, the upsides and the arguments but also the connection. Overall a superb masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nice Wes Anderson stop-motion movie,"Great Wes Anderson film. The ambiance, color palette, humor, framing, and star-studded cast we've come to expect. It's well paced with loveable, semi-relatable characters and charismatic animation. On my watch through, I was satisfied with how well loose ends tied themselves up. Not everything is explained up front, but the important questions are answered exactly when they need to be.It's not a profoundly deep film, though it does touch nice sentiments. Ultimately, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a lovely stop-motion / animated film that executes with the Wes Anderson film we've come to expect. Nice, chill watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly good,"I'm not gonna lie I saw a clip of it on titoki and thought it would be an interesting watch. This movie blew my socks off, there was so much thought put into the movie, there wasn't a single frame in the movie that wasn't absolutely stunning. It was a 9.6/10 overall, top 10 in my movies of all time. The voice acting is beautiful and the messages in the movie are not just basic and they require a little thinking to really understand, I love the dynamic between the son and the head fox, I love the growth of it throughout the movie, and the jealousy of the cousin and little fox. It is a clever film meant for all ages. Very good.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
well that was an... interesting movie to say the least,"But i enjoyed it for what it was worth. Its derinitely very unique, but in a way that kinda works. For the most part at least. Im not gonna spoil anything here, but i liked how the characters were all realistic and well flushed out, the animation was a bit stilted and left a little to be desired, and the dialogue was... interesting. One compl;aint i have with this movie is how it games tonal whiplash a lot. Like one minute the characters will be having a normal, relatable conversation, and then immediately after theyll do something silly like viscously wolf down a plate of food. Its just too quick to make it feel like a natural transition sometimes. For the most part, the characters all had very natural and realistic conversations, and i liked that aspect (when it wasnt immediately followed by something silly). The character ash was extremely annoying in the first half. Hes the typical edgy emo kid with no redeeming traits. Sure he does go through a ""character arc"" midway through thr movie, but it just feels like the writers just pulled that idea out of their cuss. There wasnt really much buildup or anything, they just had him say ""aw man im a jerk."" also the way the movie ended felt a little unconclusive, cant really say it in detail without spoiling it but it feels like they kinda left some things in an unsatisfying way.Overall though its definitely a unique experience. I would recommend it just for that alone. There were a few parts that left a little to be desired, but it outshined in other aspects as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fun Little Excursion,"Watching Fantastic Mr Fox can be a bit jarring at first. Its on the surface a Wes Anderson movie with puppets. Once you sink into it though and you enter the imaginary world its a blast. Its great to watch a film that appeals to adults and kids and isn't dumbed down. There are actually some parts that may freak out or perplex some children, but on the whole its very accessible to all.George Clooney is likable as the conflicted Mr Fox, who just cant stay out of trouble, Meryl Streep puts in a solid performance as Mrs Fox and Bill Murray is his usual droll self as Badger, Fox's lawyer. Jason Schwarztman is also memorable as Fox's emotionally strained son. Anderson regular Owen Wilson makes a cameo and his vocal inflection is actually perfect for this form.Having not read the original book I entered this with a fresh perspective, my friend who has read it numerous times still enjoyed it. It serves as a fun ride on its own and a nice progression in Wes Anderson's career. A great start to the 2010 film year.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Wes Anderson should make a box-set of his films and title it:  ""Movies to Slit Your Wrists To""","Note to parents or anyone else who likes upbeat ""feel-good"" animated movies: This isn't one of them.This isn't for kids.Hell, it's not even for most adults.The problem is the quirkiness of the story, the dry humor, and the drag-on-forever plot. All of Anderson's films (see Royal Tenenbaums & Life Aquatic especially) can be called ""quirky"" or ""odd"". They are not ""feel good movies and I've not watched one of them where there wasn't a character that suffered from severe depression or some other psychological problem of some sort. This character-type, coupled with The Fantastic Mr. Fox's animation, made for a mildly creepy blend & a barely watchable hour and a half. Wes Anderson doesn't know how to MAKE a happy movie. He doesn't know how to do anything other than make films that seem to propagate the same formula: create awkward films that make the viewer uncomfortable, fill it furthermore with depressing, cynical scenarios of family & social dysfunction and try to market them as ""humor."" Wes Anderson should market a box-set of his films and title it: ""Movies to Slit Your Wrists To""... For the love of Pete, this guy needs therapy and a good bottle of antidepressants! I'm not sure why there seems to be a strange group of people who ENJOY this kind of dark, cynical, depressing comedy. How anyone on earth could find it ENJOYABLE to sit and watch a group of characters loathe their lives, deal with awful bosses with subhuman social skills, & family dysfunction is beyond me. MOST normal people go to a movie to ESCAPE those kinds of things and ENJOY themselves! Why ANYONE would want to spend $8 - 15 to sit and watch the same kind of depressing situations on screen that they are forced to deal with in everyday life is ludicrous to me! Clooney adds little depth of character with his voice-over for the self-absorbed, kleptomaniacal Mr. Fox, & the ""dysfunctional family routine with the quirky emo kid(s) that the father doesn't appreciate"" sub-plot was already overplayed in Royal Tenenbaums. It's tiresome. I'm sick of seeing it in so many movies in the last few years, it's nauseating -- from Little Miss Sunshine to Horton Hears a Who, to this movie.In all honesty, the movie was so boring & unenjoyable to me that I literally have it stopped in the middle and have been entertaining myself now by writing this scathing review.How I rated it: VISUALS/ANIMATION: 5 I liked the style, but it would have worked better in a ""happier"" movie.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: 2 WHAT character development? CASTING: 5 EXCELLENT casting choices with Clooney, Bill Murray, & Meryl Streep but HORRIBLE script.SCRIPT/DIALOGUE: 4 The cleverness of the way the characters ""cuss"" at each other was noteworthy, but why bother with censoring the swearing when the movie's tone is so adult-oriented in the first place? PLOT: 2 Ugh. Nuff said.MOVEMENT OF STORY: 2 You'd need Ex-Lax to get this moving faster.ABILITY TO GET YOU HOOKED & KEEP YOU INTERESTED: -5 Boring. Drab. Depressing.ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO RELATE TO CHARACTERS: 3 GREAT if you like depressing, self-absorbed characters.OVERALL GRADE: D",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Peculiar, yet wonderful","I didn't know what to expect when I sat down to watch this movie, but it was delightful and different. The humour took some time to get use to, but it was like a well told story book from when I was a child. Up was down and down was up and even though nothing made sense, everything did. The story progress along nicely and once it was finished I was left with a pleasant feeling inside.Though this movie is clearly targeted at a younger audience, it is definitely something the whole family can enjoy. The clever use of the word cuss, makes for some great jokes and keeps it interesting for older audience.In parts this movie often gives you more questions then answer, and everything it does defies common reason, but this only adds to the overall charm of the movie. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Just another dead rat...,"A fox plans a food heist against a trio of livestock farmers.This is a very strong animated feature that feels distinctly Wes Anderson.The story has a simple premise and is very character driven. Mr Fox is portrayed as a loveable rogue and voiced perfectly by George Clooney. This character has an easy charm and reassuring presence throughout an enjoyable arc as he reminds us to stay true to ourselves in the face of oppression.Supporting Mr Fox are several humorous characters voiced by well known actors such as Meryl Streep, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Bill Murray, Michael Gambon, Jason Schwartzman and Brian Cox.All the above is all done with Wes Anderson's eccentric humour as he expands and Americanises Roald Dahl's source material.The animation is excellent and for me it is the most enjoyable stop-motion feature created outside of the great Aardman productions. Additionally it has an entertaining soundtrack including Jarvis Cocker and numerous recognisable tunes.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Fantastic Movie That Deserved A Fantastic Sequel,"After the movie, Disney's Robin Hood was released and before Disney's Zootopia and DreamWorks' The Bad Guys was released I watched one of the best-underrated stop motion movies that I wished that I should have watched in theatre.Fantastic Mr. Fox is absolutely the most underrated movie to watch.

But I really like Christofferson. A special white fox with a lot of talent that he has which really makes Ash the son of Mr. Fox jealous.The stop motion animation is absolutely appealing to the eyes, it's very crisp to see how good the animation is and It's amazing to see how most of the handsome, beautiful, and cute anthro characters are in the movie. Especially the white fox named Kristofferson he is such an adorable-looking character and of course some of their animated crushes who watched this movie as a kid or a long time ago.In closing, I would absolutely one hundred percent want this movie to get a sequel.

"A vastly underrated quirky, funny, perhaps even slightly profound animated film","Wes Anderson's very unorthodox take on Roald Dahl's classic Fantastic Mr. Fox really shows what animation can do. Here, fabled director Anderson, known for his hipster-esque style and dry humor, portrays the story of a fox who, going through a mid-life crisis, decides to get back into his old line of work and start stealing chickens again. Though the story is simple, the aesthetics and overall emotional appeal of the movie is astounding.Some might scoff at motion-stop, but the animation really does fit well with the film. The world it is set in is charming and colorful, and the movement of the characters is realistic when it needs to be, and cartoonish when it doesn't. The whole barrage of stars that lent their voices for this film is pretty impressive—George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson. These actors portrayed their respective characters very well, making their lines sound natural and lifelike. From Davy Crockett to the Beach Boys, this film also features an eclectic, yet appropriate, range of songs.I found Fantastic Mr. Fox most memorable for all of the little things. Every gesture, every facial expression, every under-the-breath comment from one of the characters adds to the film. In just about every scene you can find something interesting going on in the background, things you probably won't notice the first run through. The movie beckons you to pay close attention so you can truly get all of its emotional undertones and quirky character nuances. These little things may not ultimately contribute to the overall story of the movie, but that's not a bad thing. It's refreshing to see a movie that includes these unnecessary details that adds depth to the characters and environment (even if they are puppets!). In fact, I found these characters to be more lifelike and relatable than those in many live-action films. The chemistry between them is great, and even casual, seemingly unimportant conversations among these woodland creatures left me chuckling (""No you're not. You're disloyal.""). Though a dry and somewhat awkward comedy, it can also be touching or even profound at moments, making it a very enticing film indeed.Though marketed as a children's movie, it is obvious that this film has something for people of all ages. For anyone a fan of Wes Anderson, Roald Dahl, or animation in general, I wholeheartedly recommend this vastly underrated film. Anderson is off on the right foot for this genre, making me await any animated film he hopefully comes out with next.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A curious but well-executed pivot for Wes Anderson.,"There's a point in a famous director's filmography that may make you scratch your head and wonder why they pivoted into something so different. Hindsight is always an interesting way to see how the change in genre or form eventually brought on the full realization of the director's style. For Wes Anderson, his previous films had begun to develop into his distinctive style, but Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) seemed to cement its aesthetic for all future Anderson movies.Hearkening back to the original stop-motion effects from the early years of cinema, Fantastic Mr. Fox is full of frenetic energy-partly from the fur covered creatures voiced by plenty of famous actors. These aren't clay molded stop-motion models like something from Aardman or Laika. Instead, there's a sort of jointed stiffness that is played to great effect by Anderson's love of straight lines and centering on the frame. That Anderson would eventually return to this form in Isle of Dogs (2018)-along with smaller stop-motion bits in his other films-shows how influential it was in defining what a Wes Anderson film should be.Dialogue has always been a particular high point in Anderson films, and this is no different. Sure, the fast-talking characters may have lines that will go over kids' heads, but the adults will definitely get a chuckle from. However, the kids are not necessarily there for the witty banter. The kids will like the animation of these silly little creatures, and the chosen medium of animation lessens some of the violent impact that comes with the constant battle between a fox and the humans he's trying to steal from. And even if I don't consider this Anderson's best film, it definitely put him on that path.A curious but well-executed pivot for Wes Anderson, I give Fantastic Mr. Fox 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sometimes we are just another dead rat behind a Chinese restaurant,"When I see movies, I simply shoot for story's that seem worth telling and one's that seem to be told well. I don't give much thought to the genre or target audience of the film. Thus, I was initially surprised to see several children in the theatre for this movie until I remembered the source material. By the time the end credits were rolling, I wanted to ask the kids in the theatre whether they enjoyed the movie or not. I couldn't help but wonder how I would have felt had I seen it when I was 7, 8, or 9. It would have had an odd effect on me, indeed.This is not a traditional animated film, even if it does use one of the more traditional forms of animation. It is not always straightforward and direct nor does it even try to keep the senses fully satisfied during every second. In fact, the soundtrack can be very quiet at times with only simple, low level foley effects added in to what would otherwise be silent stretches with no music to dictate the emotions with. I can imagine that I probably would not have enjoyed it as a child, because my taste was limited to what fulfilled my superficial expectations.But kids should be taken to see this just so they can experience something different, yet in a familiar format. There is a lot that's expressed with these characters. Much of the narrative deals with finding one's identity. Mr. Fox asks:""Why a fox? Why not a horse, a beetle, or a bald eagle?""But nevertheless he is a fox, and in his attempt to live up to his desire of being ""fantastic,"" he does what he does best and hatches up a master plan to steal from some rather mean farmers who in turn seek vengeance. This gets not only Mr. Fox, but the surrounding community running for their lives. Meanwhile, his son deals with insecurity after the arrival of his perfect cousin.The script is witty, at times hilarious, and layered and Anderson makes nice use of the photography. His quirky direction is fitting to the main idea presented: we are all different, but ""there is something fantastic about that."" We have our abilities and inabilities and I suppose we can change how we feel about them. In the end, we just are who we are and do what we do and sometimes it might mean that no matter what we do to redeem ourselves, we are just another dead rat behind a Chinese restaurant.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nothing short of entertaining and fun,"I remember seeing this film in theaters. It sticks with me to this day and is my favorite film. I quite literally cannot say enough good things about Fantastic Mr. Fox. Maybe it's not for everyone but Wes Anderson really breathes life into the animated film genre. It's mature yet youthful. It's quirky and witty but not goofy. Ultimately, I feel like this film is timeless. Hard to believe it came out over a decade ago. Everyone's performance is outstanding and the casting is immaculate. This is the quintessential autumn film for me, personally. If I show people Fantastic Mr. Fox, I'm showing them my heart, my sense of humor, and love for animation. It just never gets old to me. If I could thank everyone involved in the creation of this film, I would. It gives me great comfort. Roald Dahl has much to be proud of.

A Delightfully Clever and Witty Stop-Motion Delight,"Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox Is a wonderful stop-motion film. This film was based on a classic children's book by Roald Dahl. With gorge Clooney voicing Mr. Fox, He does an amazing job capturing Mr. Foxes' witty personality. Anderson Does a clever job capturing the essence of Roald Dahl's story. Throughout the film there are many instances where Wes Anderson beautifully demonstrates this with the playful animation alongside their humorous dialogue performed by Gorge Clooney and other amazing voice actors. This film explores many universal themes such as family, ethics, and human (or rather animal) nature.Anderson expresses Dahl's book while still retaining all of its originality. Each of the characters are full of charm and personality, straight from the pages of Dahl's book. The characters' dialogue is very expressive by using many examples of wordplay and irony to give the story more emphasis. Fantastic Mr. Fox has a fable-like quality to it as the film explores themes of greed and morality. Throughout the film Mr. Fox wrestles with his own temptations to steal and trick alongside with the obligations to support his family. The film explores these universal themes in playful yet tragic ways.This film is beautifully shot using stop-motion. Each character's movements are meticulously executed to create an organic feeling of the world we are brought into. Anderson's incredible attention to detail in the backgrounds and playful arts and crafts style animation give plenty of life to the movie's atmosphere. The autumnal color palette paired with the storybook setting pulls the audience into Dahl's world.Around the middle of the movie, the animal community tries to change and start surviving without having to raid any farms. This is the slowest part of the film, but the pace soon picks up again once Mr. Fox devises a plan to get revenge on the farmers who wish to take his life, the showdown of animals vs humans.Overall, Fantastic Mr. Fox is an excellent movie that anyone watching will enjoy. The movie's amazing story, visuals, humor, and voice acting make a fantastic film. Fans of Wes Anderson will enjoy this movie despite it being his first animated release, and those who have read Roald Dahl's work will be impressed by this adaptation of one of his works. Fantastic Mr. Fox was indeed a fantastic film.Using the criteria of writing, visual style, pacing, entertainment, and accuracy of the source material, I have provided positive and negative evaluations of Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr. Fox. I used the characters and plot as my critical criteria. Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great film that I recommend watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Modest, lovely, entertaining","I came to this with an open mind and had none of the misgivings that some others brought with them.I know there are people out there who knew 'The Fantastic Mr. Fox' in book form, but I'd never heard of it, and I'd read a lot of Roald Dahl, particularly the short stories. The film's setting is clearly Home Counties England, somewhere between Reading and Cheltenham, but the half-Norwegian Dahl was such an Americanized writer that I never really thought of him as really English, so I had no problem with the American actors who played the animals.The charm of the film is in its unpretentious sets and its refusal to engage in grand themes. That movie-trailer scene of Clooney/Foxy looking at the stars and wondering why he's a fox and not a badger--that seems to be joke about all overwrought film scripts. The film ends with a dance in a supermarket--what could be less pretentious or more open-ended? I do feel it is a shame that more couldn't be done with Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. She has nothing to do but stand around and be the wary, censorious wife. Most of the other characters are variants of the Wes Anderson stock company we've been looking at since 'Bottle Rocket,' and that's fine with me, but it makes the characterization flatter than it needs to be. The most exciting character is Willem Dafoe's rat, who never gets a chance to develop.Still, it's all very pleasant and technologically interesting, without ever hitting you over the head with techno-innovations and philosophical pain. That's charming enough in itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A magical blend of fairy tale and family drama.,"If you are to invent a story about a fox family surviving all the crude farmers in the world, would you also invent a nursery rhyme for it? Of course you will. But the awesomeness in this simple story comes from many other things.The weird, slightly exaggerating human portraits plus the fairy tale set-ups and everything already gave this story an exotic touch. Having George Clooney and Meryl Streep dubbing the Fox couple certainly dumped more grown-up ingredients into it. After so many years of Wallace and Gromit or Coraline, you might just become picky about production values of clay animations. Try to sit through the first minute realizing it's not as polished as other technically-excellent animations, and it will reward you a lot more. Seeing the twitching movements and little mannerisms of Mr. Fox in classic songs is really one-of-a-kind enjoyment. simply put, you don't really need much brain to enjoy it, but you certainly need more sensibility to fetch everything intended.One thing good about fairy tale is you don't really need to explain why the protagonists are robbers, and why do they kill chickens, and stuff like that. Down to its core, it's still a very heart-warming family drama. For the record, if you don't want your little boy to adapt a crime career like Mr. Fox, you'd better sit through this fantastic movie with him because it's gonna render some great sweet family talk!Go to see it! 9/10 for heartwarming fun!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Possibly the Perfect Family Movie,"I don't do this very often anymore but I feel this review needs to be written.Let me start off by saying that I'm a big Wes Anderson fan. I've seen every movie with the exception of two until today which leaves me with just Isle of Dogs to watch next to catch up on all of his works.Everything about this movie is perfectly done. It's a very difficult film to critique negatively and even in the scenes where you can see the reflections of the guys doing the stop motion photography in the windows, it fits just fine. Again, everything was done well. You have the proud and highly successful father stifled by the responsibility of practical adulthood, the mother with a past, a child of seemingly little significance but incredible mental resilience but is relentlessly mocked and ignored, a relative child that is perfect at everything that gets virtually all of the admiration from the world in every moment, and a character that seemly exists purely to break the 4th wall in every scene. You also have a wonderful cast of supporting characters with their own clearly defined traits and skills to aid in the progress of the story. As the story progresses each character experiences growth in a realistic way; friendships are formed, fights start and end, disagreements about decisions arise, and neighbors quarrel and makeup. Throughout the film we see the characters battle through adversity and go from being distant neighbors in the wide open country to close friends packed into the urban setting. As they become physically closer they also become more reliant on each other and more recognizably part of each other's lives in a positive way.The animation was done flawlessly, the actors chosen to play each role were chosen perfectly, the acting was immaculate. The way that swearing without swearing was written in was one of the best gags I've ever seen in a movie because as a kid you're just hearing them say the word ""cuss"" without being able to fill in the blank; as an adult you know what they've said and more or less hear them say it only to have to remind yourself that they only actually said ""cuss"". This is a movie that anyone can sit down with anyone else of any age and it's going to be safe and fun but it'll have something for everyone. Even when CG is used, it is used properly as an effect to enhance rather than the core of the animation in the film. It seems like they did everything in their power to do everything as a practical effect. And in today's day and age of doing everything in post, that's a huge plus for me.I've gotta say, I think this is the perfect family movie.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Utterly charming and entertaining,"Wes Anderson's adaptation of Roald Dahl's book is clever, audacious, and a lot of fun. Shot using stop animation, this one-of-a-kind movie has the elegance of both The Nightmare before Christmas and James and the Giant Peach with the quirkiness you'd expect from an Anderson film. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray lend distinctive voices to a witty, delicious script.Mr. Fox (Clooney) is an unrepentant thief until he makes a promise to Mrs. Fox (Streep) that he'll quit for good (after he informs him that she's pregnant) if they escape a farmer's trap. They do, and he makes good on the promise, moving the family from their underground home to an isolated tree near three vicious, desperate super farmers. But it's not long before Mr. Fox is pining to pull off One More Job, which turns into several more jobs, with the help of Kylie the opossum.However, the three farmers aren't your typical placid farmfolk, they're vengeful jerks, so after Mr. Fox makes off with much of their birds and cider, they vow revenge, which includes using a backhoe to remove not only the tree but also a huge chunk of the earth.There's also an interesting subplot involving Mr. Fox's son Ash (Schwartzman), who feels that his parents think he's worthless and that he can't possibly compete with the super-debonair Mr. Fox. Ash is at that awkward age anyway, so dealing with his famed dad isn't easy. Then, on top of that, Ash's cousin Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) arrives for an extended stay, and he's perfect in virtually everything. So poor Ash can't measure up to his dad OR his cousin.What makes this movie really work, though, is the magnificent animation style. We've all seen those old Rankin-Fitch Christmas classics, right? This is sort of like that, only even more stylized and fluid. The film was shot at a rate of 12 frames per second, rather than the standard 24, so that viewers could really see the actual stop-motion animation process itself. And the result is that the movie feels more organic, more natural, and more poetic.A Wes Anderson movie is usually oddly endearing anyway, but this one is exceptional in its uniquity. The set pieces are dazzling (for example, the hair on the humans is from actual human hair, from the movie's crew), and the backgrounds are meticulous works of art. Neat trivia: Mr. Fox's study is a faithful recreation of Roald Dahl's garden hut, where he wrote most of his beloved books.It's fun seeing Clooney in a role he's best suited to anyway, the devilish rogue. (One gets the feeling sometimes that he'd really like to be James Bond.) Mr. Fox is certainly not without his flaws (need for spotlight, need to be right, delusions of grandeur), but his heart belongs to his family and to the other woodland creatures. The characters are nuanced just enough for kids to grasp their intentions and attitudes while not being too simplistic for adults to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Like pure liquid gold.,"I just finished watching this movie, and I must declare it...almost perfect. I love the animation style, the color choices, the almost-touchable textures, and thoroughly enjoyed the story itself. What didn't I like? Thankfully, there are very few things I disliked; but my major bone to pick was sadly one of the casting choices. For some reason (maybe I'm just too familiar with him), hearing George Clooney as Mr. Fox himself just didn't gel with me. I just couldn't accept this voice coming from that character, and it was rather hard not to see the person over the puppet. Perhaps if I was younger and had no real idea who Clooney was, it may have set better. In any case, that's really the only serious issue I had with the film itself. The story itself is nothing short of brilliant; it really does have something for everyone without being stupid. It's one of the few ""family"" films lately that has the 'nards to toss a bit of grimness and real darkness into the mix.Mr. Fox's actions DO have very severe consequences, not only for his own family but everyone around him as well. The ending itself is rather ambiguous and somewhat poignant, which suits the tale well.This is a rare and fleeting beauty of a film, see it while you can, and add it to your collection when it comes out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A film that's nostalgic in many terms and terrific technically.,"A film that's nostalgic in many terms and terrific technically.This is an animated stop-motion film and one of it's kind in today's world where there is a huge amount of technical brilliance. Stop- motion animation is one of the oldest techniques as old as Alice in wonderland in 1903 and even much before that. This film adopts the same technology and adds up a lot of speediness to make the stop motion to look real animation. So technically it is great.The content is fun, but there is a strong script over a not so strong story which is an inherent ingredient of Wes Anderson film. Had there been a stronger story, this would have been more wonderful. The voice over is stupendous and the dialogues are well written too. Above all, the humor is subtle and yet hilarious.Music by Alexandre Desplat is worth a mention as it adds a lot of weight to this film. It's a great score and gels well with the film,Wes Anderson can take a simple story and make it more than a worthwhile watch and he proves yet again with this. The art direction and the colors used are great and made the film an treat to the eye. The characterisation is one that you would find in a typical commercial film. There is a hero, a heroine, a sidekick and a villain. Together, there is a family too. So this is a perfect stop- motion family entertainer I would say.I loved this for many reasons and thanks to Anderson for bringing stop-motion back. Big thanks for his wit and sense of humor that are displayed generously in the film.A 4/5 to a great stop motion animation film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic Mr. Fox is...well...fantastic!,"There have been many of Roald Dahl's books brought to the movie world. We've had movies such as James and the Giant Peach, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, The Witches, The BFG and now Fantastic Mr. Fox, which has proved to be quite the diamond. The story is brilliant which is to be expected since it's based on a Roald Dahl book, the animation is bright and colourful and is simply superb as it uses the original classic stop motion animation. The voice acting has no faults and the characters were beautifully written and a lot of fun to watch. It's guaranteed to leave you grinning from ear to ear after you finish watching it.When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I must admit I did have some doubts but after putting them aside and watching the movie, I could see I had nothing to worry about as this is truly a classic animation for children and adults to watch. The humour involved in the movie is great and timed perfectly. It surprised me as well because, and I don't know if this is me but, the animation looked choppy and kind of slow yet when watching the animation, it was nice and smooth and ran perfectly. Almost everything about Fantastic Mr. Fox was near enough perfect to how a family animation should be. However, nothing is ever perfect and I doubt I'll ever see a perfect movie. Having said that, this movie comes pretty close to being the perfect family movie. I really do recommend this movie to everyone as I have yet to find a person who didn't fall for the charm of Fantastic Mr. Fox. This will definitely keep the whole family entertained and adults and children will adore it. I thank the cast and the crew for bringing such a classic story to life and making it fantastic.Read more reviews on: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

You keep waiting for a stroke of brilliance that just never comes.,"I have no idea why viewers at IMDb have given this movie an 8 out of 10.Well, that's not quite true. I do have an idea why. But it's not a good reason.There's a tendency in our society to rate things really highly that are different. Well, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is certainly that. Different.That's about the best I can say for it.When you combine ""different"" - which in this case means:* stop-motion animation* deliberately dull color schemes* a mostly-incoherent plot* and quirky attempts at humorwith many of the major characters speaking in extremely familiar voices (such as those of George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray and Willem Dafoe), you have a recipe for a runaway success. By ""runaway success,"" I mean that this movie somehow managed to recoup its $40 million budget.Yes, the only thing more astonishing than the fact that this plodding, (in my opinion) artless film cost $40 million to make is that it grossed more than it cost.I normally try not to give away the plot in my reviews, but there's not much worry about that with this movie. It's a looong 87 minutes.At one point I had to go and retrieve my 7-year-old son (who LOVES movies), because he had wandered away for lack of interest. It looked like something worth watching was actually about to happen. I regret that I did not allow him to go on his own way.To give them credit, they certainly tried to be ""original."" Their approach was to go a bit further than most such films in incorporating themes more relevant to adults and older teens, such as marital conflict, teenage identity crisis, flipping real estate, the sexual reputation of Mr. Fox's wife, and so forth. The result is an awkward mix of soap opera and animated action that isn't quite suitable either for children or for adults. (Interestingly, two of the three reviews immediately before mine, both from people who LOVED the film, said almost the same thing!)The good points of this film include some good voice acting by familiar voices, and some decent music.My 12-year-old son, by the way, concurs with my assessment of this movie. His review: ""The animation is pretty bad, and there wasn't really a plot. All they did was run around in sewer pipes and get shot at all the time. Definitely a one-time-view only.""Both of us (independently) also drew comparisons to the infamous Superbabies 2: Baby Geniuses. In fact, my son stated that he would rather watch the latter, as ""it actually has a plot line.""If you appreciate a movie that's different really just for the sake of being different, then you'll probably love this film. Otherwise, I'd give it a miss. Honestly, I was kind of sorry I rented it. I had in mind to rent a good family movie, and since this one was PG-rated, animated, and given a vote of 8.0 out of 10 by IMDb viewers, I thought it would be a good choice. But it really isn't a good family film, for the reasons stated above.Also, even though the film substitutes ""cuss"" for all profanity, I must admit squirming a bit when Mr. Fox sighed, ""This is gonna be a total clustercuss for everybody."" I could just see one of my kids asking me, ""Dad, what's a clustercuss?""In short: This movie was highly-rated for the exact same reason Barack Obama was elected President: It's different from what we're used to. Unfortunately, in both instances, we can see that different doesn't always mean worthwhile.Oh, and I see the first person to rate my review rated it as ""not useful,"" probably because he or she loves this film (or Barack Obama, or both). The review is what it is: an honest assessment of this movie by someone who has seen hundreds of films (if not thousands) and has reviewed 50 of them (!) here on IMDb. It tells you specifically why neither I nor any of my family liked ""Fantastic Mr. Fox.""I recognize that mine is (obviously) a minority opinion, but I don't really see how that makes for an ""unhelpful"" review. What it should tell you instead (especially when you go through additional reviews and see other 4-and-5 star ones besides mine) is that while lots of people love ""Fantastic Mr. Fox,"" it certainly is NOT for everyone. There are actually a fair number of us who simply don't agree.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Amazing for all ages,"This is actually my second time seeing this, before I start my review for this film I want to type out how I saw it last time. I went over to a friends house for a sleepover. I must have been 9 or 10, somewhere around there. We sat on his bed with his Mac Laptop and watched this film. Years have gone by and scenes from it still stick with me. After seeing The Grand Budapest Hotel I thought that maybe Wes Anderson hadn't made any other great movies. I thought that this was probably just an ok film that I had just loved as a kid. Boy was I wrong.I'll start with the characters. All, and I really do mean ALL of them. Are incredibly compelling. The main 6ish mainly but even the side characters are all interesting and unique in their own way. I remember seeing Ash and Kristofferson as a kid and thinking Ash was just a dick. Now that I'm older I can appreciate their relationship so much better. Kristofferson, or who I will from now on refer to as Krist. Is obviously much more mature then Ash. However, he is still a minor. Probably on the younger side of his teens. So while it may seem like he has his life together when he starts sniffling I felt for him. It's not easy being a kid and sometimes it's all too much. Ash also is just a kid, one that is living in his father's shadow when suddenly someone comes along and is better than him at everything he has worked so hard on. Ash feels different and like his goals aren't achievable and he struggles with that throughout the whole movie.Fantastic Mr Fox, or just Foxy. Is also cool. Clooney was probably the perfect cast choice for the role. The only other actor that I think could have done an amazing job would have been Tom Cruise. His arc and story is basically a dad ageing out of his glory days of heist and crime. So when he tries to relive what he did before he causes the lives of his family and friends to be put into jeopardy. Obviously he is the protagonist so he has to be a hero at some point but they really show peoples anger towards him quite well.The sound design in this film is also great. The score has a whimsical charm to it that really makes it pop and stick with you after. It perfectly encompasses how you feel like as a kid when you're playing as a spy around your house or something like that.Hats off to Wes Anderson. Every set piece and effect looks spectacular in stop motion. The cinematography also looks phenomenal and the way the camera moves around the world really feels true and like an actual real-life shot movie. The movie also leaves some things up to your imagination. Specifically how humans perceive foxes. They understand they're incredibly intelligent but they also still refer to them as wild animals and try to kill them in inhumane ways. There might be a deeper meaning to this but I don't want to try and pick the film apart to fit a meaning.Finally, I want to discuss the core message of the film. It dives a bit deeper than ""follow your dreams"" and ""be yourself"" it sort of lands somewhere in the middle. Saying something akin to, be yourself to the best of your ability, but also never stop trying to achieve a goal. Try new things whenever you can. Even if someone is better then you at them or even if you think you'll fail. You may be able to achieve your goal in a way you didn't think was possible before.Overall. Please watch this film. It's great for literally all ages. If you're a kid it's cool flashing imagery and characters. If you're a teen it can help if you feel like you don't fit in the world. If you're an adult you get to appreciate what an amazing film is.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Fantastic Mr. FoxWithout foxes, British aristocrats would have to chase peasants through the forest. And while treeing a serf with bloodhounds does sound brilliant, their pelts rarely fetch more than a farthing.Luckily, foxes do exist. Furthermore, they're quite the characters, as revealed in this stop- motion animation adventure.Years after he promised his wife (Meryl Streep) that he wouldn't steal, Mr. Fox's (George Clooney) animal instinct compels him to spearhead nightly raids on nearby farms. Unfortunately, his actions land him, his family and their animal friends in a war against three local farmers.Based on the book by Roald Dahl and directed by Wes Anderson, Fantastic Mr. Fox is an imaginative film brimming with terrific characters, set designs and wry vocal performances from Anderson mainstays, like, Bill Maurry, Jason Schwartzman and Owen Wilson.As for the stealing prowess of foxes, don't make me laugh.

Fantastic Mr. Fox,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is a masterpiece of cinema. I do not indulge in many Wes Anderson films but this however is an exception. It gives hope to the future of stop-motion and will hold up forever. The cinematography is absolutely phenomenally creative and beautiful throughout as well as the lighting and use of stop-motion elements. Everything is stop motion, from the smoke to the water; you would never notice. It is all of the small details that happen simultaneously that make it feel so real. The cast brings so much emotion to the characters and George Clooney and Meryl Streep do a beautiful job playing a fox that is both civilized and (wait for it) a wild animal.The chapter names as well are a nice reference back to the book.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

But Clooney, Streep, and Schwartzman just seemed to be reading their parts.While based on a children's book, the movie is not something I'd want a child of mine to see. It's too dark and even, at times, violent.If you are reading this to decide if you want to watch this movie, use the 90 minutes to do something fun, like scrubbing the grouting the shower.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Wes Anderson's Gleeful Stop-Motion Animation is No 'Fox Paw'!,"Wes Anderson's cool quirks and characteristics follow him into the land of stop-motion animation with Fantastic Mr. Fox, an eye-popping, hilarious adaptation of the Roald Dahl children's book.It's the timeless tale of Mr. Fox (George Clooney), who has enjoyed a life of doing what foxes do best: prowling for fowl. A prologue finds the dashing rapscallion and his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) raiding a poultry farm. After they get ensnared by a trap, Felicity announces that she's pregnant, and our plucky fox finds himself trapped in a different sort of cage: parental responsibility. Mr. Fox, after promising his wife he wouldn't thieve anymore, settles into a humdrum life as a newspaper columnist. But he can't suppress his natural friskiness for long.In an attempt to reclaim some thrills and escape the daily doldrums, he plans ""one last heist"" (we've heard that before). The mark: a dastardly trio of farmers - Boggis, Bunce and Bean, whose delectable deposits of chickens, ducks and cider are too delicious to deny. After Mr. Fox makes a mockery of their security by plotting daring - and quite humorous - night raids of their farms, the trio combines forces and goes on the offensive to kill their furry nemesis. The critters burrow deep into the Earth and capture the attention of local media. As the farmers amp up their machinations to bring an end to their clever rival, the animal community is dragged into this war of wits and survival, as Mr. Fox tries to find a way to save his family and friends.As the voice of Mr. Fox, Clooney gives a wry nod and sly wink of a performance, while Streep slips so easily into the vocal role as his stern but loving wife, you don't notice her presence. The entire cast, that also includes Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, seems to be having so much fun you cannot help but imagine them sipping martinis during the voice recordings. While the performances make Fantastic Mr. Fox enthralling and overwhelmingly heartwarming, it's the film's splendid, old-fashioned stop-motion visuals that will win hearts. Wes Anderson's team boundlessly, buoyantly fill each frame with fine flourishes. Each intricately orchestrated frame feels like a gloriously animated page of a picture book. Landscapes resemble carpet remnants and fire extinguishers plume what looks like cotton candy. The adorable animals and the gorgeous environment displayed in the film seem like the felt patches of a children's book that are intended to be caressed against your cheek and held close to your chest. It not only looks scruffily beautiful, but it's hilariously off-balance, warm-hearted, perfectly composed and detailed and casually but meaningfully acted. This last feat is again the result of Anderson's inscrutable perfectionism.The film incorporates all the quiet, improvisational style, dry humor delivery as found in Anderson's cinema, but combined with the proletarian fluidity of the animation; the result for audiences is a gleeful trance-like holiday. Wes Anderson's stop-motion animation is perhaps the purest distillation yet of his nerveless twee cinema of quirk.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fox Hole Puppetry,"Wes Anderson never tells traditional stories and never in a traditional manner. Since he entered the artistic world with ""Bottle Rocket"" in 1996, he treated us to accessible fare (the likes of ""Rushmore"" or ""The Royal Tenenbaums"") and bits that are a little harder to swallow (""The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,"" ""The Darjeeling Limited""), constantly keeping it entertaining and whimsical. So who better to discard CGI imagery and take one big step back to good ol' fashioned stop motion animation in order to tell Road Dahl's classic story (with a few liberties taken in the script)? George Clooney's recognizable voice is ideally cast to bring sly Mr. Fox to puppet life, and Meryl Streep, sounding a little restrained, is a pleasure as his wife - that would be Mrs. Fox. Long-time Anderson regulars (Jason Schwartzman, Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody, and - yes - Bill Murray) lend their voices to all sorts of critters. The story eases along fluidly with wryly funny - but not sitcommy - dialogue, and the scenery is so stunningly beautiful that you tend to forget how many hours of work must have gone into this little gem. Yet it all looks so deceptively simple.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Mr. Fox on film,"I had read this amusing short story by Roald Dahl (author of The BFG, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and other works) about a highly intelligent fox that steals fowl from farmer neighbours for his family. Additionally, I have a fine admiration for foxes. I had seen the new ""Mr. Fox"" animated film two Fridays ago.In the film, Mr. Fox, a newspaper columnist living in a den with his wife Felicity and son Ash, decides to move into a tree house. However, his lawyer, Mr. Badger, warns him against buying the property due to the presence of three mean, rich farmers near the area: Mr. Boggis, a chicken farmer; Mr. Bunce, a short and stout farmer; and Mr. Bean, a lean turkey and apple farmer. These farmers are so mean that local children sing a limerick taunting them. Despite these warnings, Mr. Fox and his family move into the tree house. A week after the move, Felicity's nephew Kristofferson visits while his father is ill. Ash, who has a keen interest in sports and seeks his father's approval, participates in athletic competitions. Meanwhile, Mr. Fox and Kylie, the opossum building superintendent, steal produce and poultry from various farms without his wife's knowledge, while three enraged farmers are out to get him.That's all I could tell you, folks; you will have to see the film for yourself to see how it ends. Overall, I really enjoy this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Anderson masterpiece of craftsmanship and direction.,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is easily the best animated feature of 2009. It should be rewarded with an Oscar nomination (and is every bit deserving of a win) even though Pixar's Up (2009) could land the coveted statuette based on popular votes. Adapted from the beloved Roald Dahl children's book of the same name, the film tells the story of Mr. Fox and his sneaky scheme to steal poultry, especially chicken, from three nearby farms run by three nasty, detestable humans with a collective mission: to kill Mr. Fox and his family.Director Wes Anderson who is well-known for films such as Bottle Rocket (1996), Rushmore (1998), and The Royal Tenenbaums (2001) is one of the key American filmmakers of the 90s to revive the low-budget independent offbeat comedy. Even though much of his works remain under-appreciated, Anderson has a loyal following claiming that he is one of the great filmmakers of our time. While that might be exaggerating it a fair bit, Fantastic Mr. Fox shows us why he is on course to being judged as such.Fantastic Mr. Fox follows the stop-motion tradition of the Wallace And Gromit films, and refutes the argument that brilliant animated films can only be made by Pixar. Anderson's obsession with detail and his mastery of mise-en-scene also means that the film is far from 'kiddish'; on the contrary, it can be seen as quality art. While children may enjoy the visuals and the odd dose of behavioral humor (e.g. how the foxes consume their meal or how they dig themselves out of trouble), parents who are forced to tag along are far more likely to appreciate the authenticity of the character and set models used, and the themes of 'family', 'responsibility', and 'collectivism' which reverberate with quiet resonance throughout the film.There is some superb voice work on show here with George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. Supporting voice talents include stars Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, Michael Gambon, William Dafoe, and Owen Wilson. An 'ethnic' influence is evident in one of the characters here whose obsession with yoga and its meditative properties recalls a certain 'spiritual' Schwartzman in The Darjeeling Limited (2007), Anderson's previous film about three brothers on a bonding trip to India.Fantastic Mr. Fox also explores the important theme of domesticity versus the wild. Mr. Fox has a lovely family and he dotes on them. In short, he lives a comfortable life in his big house under a tree. But more often than not, he succumbs to his animalistic instinct by 'hunting' for food from the farms. He enjoys the temporal satisfaction of being a wild animal, or in this case, a sly, scheming fox. In a key scene, Mr. Fox has a fleeting encounter with a black wolf. Even though suppressed by a psychological fear of wolves, he admires from distance the dark beauty of the creature, its freedom to roam the lands, to hunt, and its fortune to avoid the tepidity that is domesticity.An Anderson masterpiece of craftsmanship and direction, Fantastic Mr. Fox very much assures itself of a spot in my top ten films of 2009.GRADE: A (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Adorabibble,"So it turns out that Wes Anderson's unique rhythm and wry sense of humour is a natural fit for stop-motion animation. Indeed, after a few minutes you mostly forget you're watching an animated movie as there's little difference between this and Anderson's other films. His signatures are very much at home here and really feel alive in this new environment.It's quite refreshing to watch an animated film that doesn't rely on puns and slapstick humour. The characters are interesting and the tone was so low key that even the more ridiculous elements have a soft landing. It's a children's movie where actions have consequences while also featuring better heist planning than Ocean's Eleven. Remarkable.As film scores can make or break an animated film, it was critical for first-time Anderson collaborator Alexandre Desplat to not only deliver a quality animated score, but to reconcile that with Anderson's style. Desplat manages to do both and, not surprisingly, went on to work with Anderson on Moonrise Kingdom and The Grand Budapest Hotel.In the end, Fantastic Mr. Fox is not so much a movie that makes you feel like a kid again as it is a children's movie that's grown up. But in many ways, as a reluctant adult, that suits me better.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful Film,"Roald Dahls written work has taken on a life in the form of film. His stories are often darkly comedic and occasionally find themselves bordering the morbid. But that is the beauty of Dahls storytelling, he does not flinch from the notion that children can be adult and adults can be childish. Nowhere has this been more evident than in Wes Anderson's adaption of Fantastic Mr Fox. The film dives into what it means to be a father and husband, and the relationship of his family, and also explores issues of class struggles. Wes Anderson presents the film to his audience with his old-school stop motion animation, it's beautifully portrayed. There is a constant use of warm colours which were used to depict the humans and animals in the film, the colour scheme is also involved with the characters and their costumes. Anderson also uses wide camera shots, to make the movie easier to watch, while using the rule of thirds, having the most important element in the middle of the screen. Wes Anderson has a flawless filming style and a beautifully shot film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Anderson Should've Done Animation All Along,"There are many criticisms towards Wes Anderson films, mainly, that they are pretty to look at but do not have much beneath the surface. To that I respond if you do not see anything beneath it's because you are not looking. Fantastic Mr. Fox is like many of Anderson's past endeavors: The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and The Darjeeling Limited. It's centered around the importance of family and what you will do to protect them.Mr. Fox is fantastic, as his wife and his children, but being fantastic sometimes isn't enough. Tired of the inertia of daily life Mr. Fox steals from the top three farmers in the area in an effort to reclaim some of that, ""pure wild animal craziness"". Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) seeking a responsible husband to take care of her and her children wants no part of his coop-raiding days and seeks an end to all of it. Unfortunately Mr. Fox does not heed her advice and Boggis, Bunce and Bean launch an all-out war against Fox and his family.George Clooney was perfect casting for Mr. Fox, the suave, sly and often persuasive head of the Fox family who realizing he is reaching up there in years decides to just be what he is - a wild animal. Uncharacteristic to most of Mr. Clooney's roles, however, is the emotional vulnerability he lends to Mr. Fox. Despite the smooth polished exterior he has created, Mr. Fox is not all that different from his introverted son, Ash.Anderson's latest brings back some of the fun of Rushmore that Darjeeling lacked and it shows. The earth tones used to create the home of the characters evoke a warm, friendly feeling and ground the story in a way that sometimes The Life Aquatic did not. It really is a pleasure to see stop-motion animation revived and done so well.Led by an excellent voice cast headed by Clooney, Streep, Schwartzman, Dafoe and Murray(see 9, this what an actual ensemble animation film looks like) each character is fleshed out effectively to avoid cardboard cutouts.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Unique quirky animated film starring a fox!,"""We're all different. Especially him.

Fantastic Mr. Fox is a really unique type of animated film. It's stop-motion and it wouldn't be the last time director Wes Anderson using stop-motion. Isle of Dogs uses the same technique (look forward to seeing a review of that soon). This film also uses a lot of wide shots throughout its runtime. I'm not complaining since it helps create and how ""fantastic"" this film is.Voice actors give great performances as their characters. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Murray, the list goes on!

To be avoided at ALL costs,"Appalling ego-induced carelessness from director Wes Anderson, betrayal of the great Roald Dahl, and just sheer stupidity are present in the worst adaptation of Dahl's work since the abominable 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' (1971).Those sensational chapters from the delightful children's story are simply glossed over quickly and emotionlessly.Instead, the enthusiasm has gone towards the pathetic and most unnecessary additions. It has also idiotically been filled with adult American sit-com-style humour – one can hardly think of anything more inappropriate for a Roald Dahl children's story. Such a sickening amount of time is wasted as numerous failed attempts are made to be sharp, witty and funny.The results are very lifeless and cynical and share 9's problems with narrative and audience.Yet despite all this it is somewhat enjoyable, and one cannot hate it entirely.This is most likely owing to the honest, home-style animation, which is by no means perfect as the work characters' facial expressions are downright awful, but it is definitely the best thing on offer here.Or perhaps it is the novelty of having a voice cast of well-known and well-loved actors – George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Michael Gambon... – but sadly most of them are underused, miscast, or just simply don't deliver.Bottom line: avoid this at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Best movie you'll see for this Holiday Season.,"A story about two foxes, Mr. & Mrs. Fox who once had a living in stealing chickens from a farm. However after escaping from a trap, Mrs. Fox told her husband that she doesn't want to steal chickens anymore due to the risk of getting trap became higher than before. Mr. Fox ending up agreeing with his wife that he'll find a new line of work in order for them to start a family. Some years later, Mr. Fox is now a newspaper writer for a column that's not very well received in the paper. Mrs. Fox spends her time doing scenery paintings. They both ended up having a son who tries to become an athlete but is too short to be fitted for sports.Everything seem good for Mr. Fox & his family, only with the exception on his career as a newspaper writer and the fox hole they're living in. So he goes to a real estate agent to check out on a tree that is on sale. The reason being is that it's next door to three big time farms owned by Mr. Boggis, Bunce, & Bean. All three of the farmers don't tolerate with wild animals or carnivores that steal their profits. Mr. Fox asked his lawyer about it, but his lawyer says it's not wise to live next to three wildlife hating farmers. However Mr. Fox ignores his lawyer's advice and has his family move in. While keeping it a secret from his wife, he plots out three plans to steal from each of the three farmers their profits. As it's in a foxes's nature to steal chickens and anything else that's editable. However messing with these three farmers would mean trouble to Mr. Fox and anyone who's connected with him. The farmers on't rest until Mr. Fox is shot and stuffed with cotton. But pretty soon, the farmers will learn that you should never try to out smart a fox.I never read the book, but I gotta say I really enjoyed this movie. For Wes Anderson's first animated film, I love the idea of the whole film made in Stop Motion Animation instead of the now commonly done CGI. That's one of the reasons this movie stands out more than the recently released animated films. I also love the story, action, & character alike. I've seen Wes's other films so I knew this movie was going to have some great moments and at least one memorable quote. Just like what was presented in his previous films. Also it has an all star cast along with people who have worked with Wes in the past.If you're looking for an animated movie that looks better than Planet 51, then Fantastic Mr. Fox is the other choice. Cause this movie is something that both kids and adults will enjoy together. To me it's a movie I'll definitely watch again and again.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Boggis, Bunce and Bean","How can we not love stop-motion animation! I am such a fan of Wes Anderson and this amazing movie. It was the first of his films that I ever watched, and I was admittedly a child when I first viewed it. That doesn't stop me, however, from thoroughly enjoying it now as an adult. Once again, the story is told in a captivating way that can hold the attention of all age groups, while investigating heavier themes. And c'mon, the cast?! Out of this world.

Extremely Unique and Funny,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is a very funny, wonderfully-looking movie with a stellar cast.First of all I love how the film portrays these animals. They live like humans, they are intelligent, but there is still a hierarchy between people and animals. The writing most likely includes some of Roald Dahl's original sentences, which were beautiful to hear, but Wes Anderson and Noah Baumbach also made a very good job writing new dialogues and monologues. I haven't read the original, but this version is unbelievably funny.I don't know much about animation in general, but I know this is stop motion.

Really funny and at times touching.,"For a debut in animation, Fantastic Mr. Fox delivered more than expected. The voice cast was top-notch, the humour was sophisticated and the story quite unique. I don't know about the book it is based on, I only review it as a movie.Mr. Fox's longing for old times when he was on top of the game of stealing chickens really gets him and his fellow animal friends into trouble with the farmers who deal with it in a quite brutal way to be honest, but the execution of the story with the humour added makes the ride very enjoyable.The music was also very well composed and added much to the atmosphere of the rural setting and the different situations the main characters end up getting themselves into.I especially liked the subplot of Mr. Fox's son and nephew. That part was one of the major reasons this movie also has its heartfelt moments and an uplifting message about teamwork and that being is not a crime.Immensely enjoyable with an appeal to both kids and adults.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic Mr Fox?.......Not so fantastic,"As a child I loved this book along with Little Women and the full set of Narnia books. I was interested in seeing it, sadly I was met with an abomination of a movie that really had little relevance to the book at all.It is sad when a classic British book such as Fantastic Mr Fox is Amercanised as this has been. They could have made it classically British by using English actors to do the voices, they could have kept the story faithful by adhering more closely to the book. But, they didn't. Instead they have used American actors and gung-ho music to make it more like an over-the-top adventure movie with some poor attempts at humour. It's obvious the market they were aiming at and does not take a lot of thought to figure it out.If Roald Dahl had still been alive I do not think he would ever have allowed this film to be made, let alone released as no real justice has been done to the book at all. A real shame. Do yourself a favour and read what is a really great book. Whatever you do, avoid this heap of junk of a movie at all costs.I've given it 1/10 because you can't go any lower.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
An enjoyable family film of theft and responsibility.,"""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is rare in modern cinema, being filmed in stop motion animation. Using stop motion sets it apart from other recent animated features that rely more on computer images (CGI) this choice adds to the effect of the adventures of a fox that tries to fight against his own thieving nature. ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" effectively presents the whimsical nature of its children's book (written by Roald Dahl, best known for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) roots with the choice of animation technique. The theme of responsibility and honesty are common in children's stories but are effectively packaged. The hero being well intentioned but flawed (if not almost entirely careless) character makes the film accessible to the whole family without being overly pushy in delivery.Vocal casting is overall well done, but at times it can be annoying and cliché for an animated feature. George Clooney lends his voice for the role of Mr. Fox adding a feeling of ""smooth"" cockiness while maintaining the ability to garner the audience's sympathy when needed. The voice of Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep) carries a tone of ""responsibility"" while at times being demanding in nature (and irritating in its constant seriousness). Jason Schwartzman's typical role choice of an awkward socially inept character is a good fit for the role of Ash (the son of Mr. and Mrs. Fox). The most surprising vocal talent in the film is Willem Defoe's character of the psychotic French accented, Rat.Animation techniques used in this film are reminiscent of cartoonish, technically sophisticated Ray Harryhausen, offering smoother movements and better character integration with the backgrounds. From a technical standpoint the style very effectively matches the story, sound effects are comedic and appropriate (Mr. Fox's whistling seems to be borrowed from Donald Sutherland's character ""Hawkeye"" Pierce in ""M.A.S.H. (1970),"" which was also used more recently in ""The Losers (2010)""), lighting is appropriate for mood, and the effects are suitable to the films fantastic nature.The awkward humor and overall style of ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is similar to Wes Anderson's other films ""The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)"", ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)"" and ""Rushmore (1998)"". It's hard to point exactly what the similarity in Wes Anderson's movies is, but those familiar with his past films will notice it in this one as well (many actors in Anderson's previous pictures also appear in this one). In all, ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is an enjoyable film of an impulsive fox and the prices he and others must pay for his actions. Despite some of the occasional annoyances from some of the vocal talent (this is personal taste), delivering the themes of delivery responsibility and friendship in an effective and enjoyable manner makes it worth watching at least once (even to just see modern use of stop motion). And perhaps the greatest message of all is not about stealing squibs or seeking adventure but about remembering to dance.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a refreshing breath of air!,"I had no idea what to expect when I saw this movie, and I've always been weary of claymation so I didn't actually think I would love this movie as much as I did. It was pretty spectacular and seriously underrated! George Clooney's iconic voice lends much personality to his character even when he was being a bit monochromatic or sarcastic. There are scenes in this movie that are still at the top of my favorites list and whenever I get a chance I try to show this movie to as many people as I can. This movie is mainly for adults rather than children, but I'm guessing children could be entertained by it too. I loved the way they skirted around swearing by coming up with a unique way to do it and my friends and I love quoting it around kids and parents, who aren't sure what to make of it when it happens. There is a particular scene where a farmer loses his temper and to this day it makes me fall out of my chair laughing. The wolf at the very end almost makes me lose it too. I highly recommend this movie if you're looking for animated movie that is more suitable for adults, you'll be pleasantly surprised!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Anderson strikes again,"When a director whose films have taken on a steady fan base decides to change direction with an entirely new genre, it's a risky move. None as risky as Wes Anderson's latest work Fantastic Mr. Fox, his animated feature film debut. I can't think of any filmmakers going behind the camera of an animated film having been this successful in live action.Well, his risk has payed off and I am confident in saying that Fantastic Mr. Fox is one of the year's best. It is based on the classic children's book of the same name by famed writer Roald Dahl. It's the story of a fox who gets the idea of stealing from three of the meanest local farmers: Boggis, Bunce, and Bean. It has been many years since I have read the book, but it was an excellent read when growing up.When I saw that Anderson was making this film, I was as anxious as ever. Then I saw the trailer and all my worries went away. Anderson is able to transfer his style to animation flawlessly. His use of tracking side shots, symmetric division of the screen with his characters, colorful sets, and his amazing soundtrack with both original tracks and carefully selected tracks from other artists like Burl Ives, The Beach Boys, and The Rolling Stones.Rather than just getting a bunch of big name actors in a sound studio one at a time, Anderson devised a system where he actually the recorded the actors acting out what their characters are doing. Be it eating, rolling, or digging, the actors performed their actions along with their lines. The film features some of Anderson's stars from other films like Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Wallace Woldarsky, and Michael Gamdon, as well as two important lead performances by George Clooney as Mr. Fox and Meryl Streep as Mrs. Fox. I love the casting Anderson chose for each character. I don't think it could have gone any better.Anderson uses stop animation wonderfully here. It gives the characters a certain edge to them and it makes them wacky enough and serious enough so that kids and adults can enjoy the whole production. It's rated PG and I think that parents will agree that some of the film just isn't for kids, and that is not a knock against the film. I just don't think kids will really get what Anderson is trying to accomplish here. It's not too graphic or inappropriate but some of the humor is a little over their heads. No worries though, kids will love it and will not be harmed by it in any way.There is so much to enjoy here. The clever writing, the beautiful sets, and the, I hate to say it, fantastic story, all add up to an impressive film that shows Anderson is a filmmaker capable of doing whatever he wants. Perhaps a black and white, silent film starring only dogs. On second thought that might be right in his wheelhouse. I have to think of a real challenge for him.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A cussing great animated movie.,"Wes Anderson's direction provides some of the most beautiful and intelligent scenes not only in the history of animated movies, but movies in general. Each shot is so well thought out and purposeful that it feels more like watching a piece of artwork come to life than an actual film. The voice acting is brilliant from Clooney and the rest of the gang and the score is the cherry on top of this unique animated near-masterpiece. 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

This might just be Nostalgia Talking,"This might just be nostalgia talking but I absolutely love this film, this was my favourite movies as a child and it still is now.

The voice cast is all A listers, Clooney and Meryl Streep are the main characters, and the entire movie is one of the most enjoyable viewing experiences I've ever experienced.I could keep rambling on about this film for hours but I hope I've managed to get across how much I love it.

Not so fantastic....,"So far, Roald Dahl's stories have made a successful transfer to the big screen. This film could be said to have horribly ruined that positive trend. James and the Giant Peach, another Roald Dahl story, was brought to life through the use of stop-motion animation as well back in 1996. Similar to the way that Microsoft took a step backwards by upgrading everyone to the inferior Windows Vista, director Wes Anderson lets this film take a plunge by getting a high-definition camera and taking half the pictures that a fluent stop-motion film would require. This results in staccato movements that distract the audience and sap all the potential magic that could have been in the film. Indeed a lot of mistakes are made in the film. Whatever cleverness that Dahl may have originally written into his story is ruined by the director's idea of an alternate ending and overall an apparent carelessness to the way the film was constructed. I'm not saying the film is complete garbage, some parts do stand out, hinting at how good the original story may have been. But somehow even the clever parts, like the characters saying ""cuss"" when they intend to swear, becomes distracting and even unfriendly towards younger audiences when you realize that the swear it's replacing is the ""f-word"", just shy of them saying ""mothercusser"". Probably the worst stop-motion film I've ever seen, The Fantastic Mr. Fox is in no way fantastic and should be left alone.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Whimsical Charm, Foxy Fun","Fantastic Mr. Fox is a delightful gem that captures the quirky brilliance of Wes Anderson in all its stop-motion glory. From the moment the film begins, it's clear that you're in for a visual treat. The meticulously crafted animation brings a unique charm to the story, with each frame bursting with rich details and vibrant colors. Anderson's signature style-symmetrical compositions, dry humor, and eccentric characters-translates perfectly into the world of talking animals, creating an experience that's as whimsical as it is visually stunning.The witty dialogue and clever banter keep the story engaging, and there's a light-heartedness to it all that makes it incredibly fun to watch. However, I do have to admit that Anderson's distinct style might not be for everyone. The film's quirky pacing and offbeat humor can be a bit alienating if you're not already a fan of his work. Some of the jokes may fly over the heads of younger viewers, and there are moments where the story feels more like an excuse for Anderson to indulge in his stylistic tendencies than to drive the plot forward.That said, Fantastic Mr. Fox is a wonderful ride for those who appreciate its unique approach. It's a film that oozes personality and charm, with enough heart to make you smile from start to finish. Even with its minor flaws, it's a fantastic example of how animation can be both artistically ambitious and thoroughly entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cussing beautiful,"It isn't the same to watch the movie as a kid than as an adult; It's even more funnier when you grow up and you understand everything. A thing that made me laugh inside (I never laugh) was when the Mr Fox, during the last step of the robbery, rejected his son but invited his nephew.(PD: I haven't watched this movie as a kid, I watched it for the first time 3 days ago and I already watched it 2 times, one time in Spanish and another in English with captions, and it's more amazing and quicker the second time you watch it: So many details, you won't get bored. I don't know how is to watch this movie as a kid, but my 10 years old sister enjoyed it.)The animation isn't the common Pixar thing that you see everyday, but I LOVE IT. It's the perfect stop motion, every character has its own personality and they look cussing beautiful. It's a dead but freaking cool style, harder and more expensive to do than a 3D itself movie, and some people hate it because it's just... (Waving hands crazily) Different.The moral of this story can make you to change by different ways.
For example,
If in the real life you're the mad and unperfect cousin of someone, after this movie, you'll regret about yourself and start to improve.

Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009) - What a Fantastic Mr. Foxy-Fox! He's Just Dre-amy!,"The wonderful stories of the late Roald Dahl, from ""James and the Giant Peach"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", and ""Matilda"", have been adapted in plenty of film adaptations. You know, at first, I didn't think that a ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" movie was a good idea, until I saw the ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" movie, it's actually pretty cool. Based on a popular children's novel of the same name, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" stars George Clooney giving voice to the title role as Mr. Fox, a fox who steals food each night from three mean and wealthy farmers, 'Boggis, Bunce, and Bean'. The farmers had enough with Mr. Fox's antics, and they try to kill him by digging their way into their home, without knowing that the foxes are hiding underground, and they have to live without being bothered by farmers. Aside from Clooney's hilarious and excellent voice performance, the rest of the cast includes Meryl Streep as Mr. Fox's wife, Jason Schwartzman as Ash, the son who tries to become an athlete, Bill Murray as Mr. Fox's lawyer, and Owen Wilson in a short performance as Ash's school coach. It is ""movie magic"" to watch these actors bring voice to these colorful characters. Wes Anderson seems to be the perfect director for this movie, he's always been known for making such strange and whimsical movies that fall on a dysfunctional yet satisfying level. The writing is sharp and believable, the characters are funny, and the animation is pretty impressive. The jokes are pretty cocky, and there are moments when you chuckle or cringe. I will say that is a pretty entertaining movie with sharp characters, smart writing, beautiful music, and impressive animation. Although this movie is weird and cocky, it's totally worth your time. The whole family will love it, even adults. If you're a little kid who adores the books by Roald Dahl, or if you never read the book, this is still a pretty fun movie that will totally fool your senses.

"A great movie with great acting, beautiful animation and, of course, Wes Anderson's brilliance.","What differs Anderson's movies and non-Anderson's movies is a specific style of portraying characters and scenes. In Fantastic Mr. Fox Anderson does it brilliantly, yet again. The devil is in the details, how exactly one character says a line, with what intonation, what level of volume, what pronunciation of certain words, all of these are parameters which influence a speaking scene in Anderson's movies. What's especially refreshing is seeing all those elements put together in an animated movie. Animation is really well done and the scenes are beautiful. The story is interesting, fun and plausible if you suspend some belief which lowered movie's grade by one point in my review.

Unoriginal and boring.,"I had some high expectations about this movie, seeing it had been nominated for a lot of awards and such.Though when I started watching I was disappointed within the first few minutes. Barely nothing happened and the moments that were apparently meant to be exciting seemed to lack something. I can't recall a single moment of the film that had me excited. I guess that might be because of it's lack of originality. It felt like I had watched the entire movie many times before. There was absolutely nothing about the buildup, the turning points, the conflicts, the characters nor the ending that I had not seen before. It's like the whole concept was just copied and pasted off a hundred other movies!Apart from that the humor had a very low standard. 9 out of 10 jokes were incredibly poor. The messages this movie try to send are of course good, but nothing new.What's the point about making a movie that practically already exist? Lack of talent, ideas and effort I guess.

The performances are pretty good, there's a lot of subtlety in the voice acting in a lot of scenes. The thing it's hard to grasp when watching this movie is the weird, unsettling mix of family comedy and slightly dark humor. It's not exactly a simple ""animals vs humans"" story. The main character is a predator, a thief, a mischievous creature reformed by his family life. Alongside him there's his unsatisfied teen son who envies his more likeable cousin, his patient wife, his neighbors. There's a pretty obvious social subtext about an underclass rebelling, about ""selling out"", the need for adventure. There's a lot of mixed emotions in the characters actions and reactions, a cheerfulness that sort of hides (or cures) a deep existential angst among all of the characters. I personally wish that these darker tones were developed a little bit more instead of being just a slight aftertaste, but otherwise this movie is a perfectly nice, fun, colorful and thoughtful adventure.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Humorous Yet Beautiful Movie,"I am an enjoyer of most Claymation films and Wes Anderson movies with a bit of humor in them. The time put into Claymation films interests me and I often enjoy older films like this one. I specifically remember watching this movie with my dad when I was around 10 and laughing over the quick, witty humor in it. The movie gives off a very comforting autumn vibe that I enjoy and oftentimes has beautiful fall landscapes in the backgrounds accompanying the characters. The unique humor really stands out to me as in the random references to the characters' animal instincts coming out for comedic effect. I loved the scene where Mr. Fox and Clive were arguing and then suddenly started growling at each other like animals. I think the only downside to the quickness of the movie is that it can be hard to follow at times with the scenes changing rapidly. I also think that, as a younger viewer when this movie came out, specific scenes came off as creepier to me. I remember the scenes where Mr. Fox would smile with his wide eyes and teeth that made it uncomfortable to look at. A lot of Wes Anderson movies are similar in the way that they are put together. There is always a specific type of humor used that fits perfectly with each movie. Fantastic Mr. Fox is similar to The Grand Budapest Hotel in the way that they are both shorter movies, under 2 hours, have similar humor, and both have very eye-catching scenes with vibrant colors. Its wacky humor matched with the beautiful scenery make for a very enjoyable watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
What a fantastic film!,This movie was fantastic because it give more details on the story to surrender ourselves from harm and giving us protection on ourselves on what we do in our lives like fox and human being on what they do.The people work so hard on making a stop motion film this is almost look like the movie called Isle of dogs they really have a good animation graphics. I LOVE THIS WES ANDERSON when it comes to animation films.I don't really much slang words on what they are saying in some parts but the soundtrack was so good and entertaining to viewers to anyone in their own age of making movies like this. When movies these days it doesn't look the same as they make movies right now but their movies they really good at.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Return of a great stop motion animation film,"It's the return of stop motion animation and I loved it, it's a shame this film's hard work didn't pay off at the box office though. Okay so the story is about a Fox family Mr.Fox(George Clooney), Mrs.Fox(Meryl Streep), and their son(Jason Schwartzman), Mr. Fox a retired thief for livestock who wants to return to his greatness of being a thief. And in order to do so, he plans to steal from the 3 farms that is occupied by 3 different but dangerous farmers. And soon the farmer go on a all out war with Mr. Fox and a war between them begins. The actors voice fit right in with the characters and didn't have any complaints about it, I also enjoyed the style of humor that was in this film. The stop motion also adds to the quirky personalities of each characters and the story is even well written and enjoyable. The movie simply shines.8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

What a waste of time and money,I watched this movie with my 3 children my fiancé and my mother. We managed to stomach about 40 minutes of it before we gave up. This was one of the worse things I've ever seen on t.v. screen.My children and fiancé watched the trailers for this at the mall as part of there testing program. The kids thought it looked like a cool movie but didn't get what it was about and neither did my fiancé. Apparently the previews were the best part of the movie a few seconds of cute charters were about all any of us could take. The animation may be descent but overall this was mis advertised as a children's file and overall a horrible movie.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Identity of Fantastic Mr. Fox,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is directed and co-written by Wes Anderson, and it stars George Clooney as Foxy Fox, Meryl Streep as Felicity Fox, Jason Schwartzman as Ash, and Eric Chase Anderson as Kristofferson in a stop motion animated film. The film is about Foxy Fox who's an expert in stealing stuff from humans alongside his wife Felicity. He gave up on robbery for their child, but years later, three farmers moving into the neighborhood caused Foxy to go back on robbery, only to realize that he got more than what he bargained for. In this theme, it tackles identity as Foxy Fox doesn't quite get himself figured out about what would be the best life for him to finally relax and just settle. He didn't like the ideal life of just living in a home relaxing because it makes him feel poor. So when he started robbing the three farmers after moving to a different location, he was very energized and felt alive when doing it at the cost of breaking his promise.Another character that's also going through an identity issue is Ash, Foxy's son. He wants to be just like his dad when it comes to playing the same sport that his dad was in and even wants to join his dad in stealing food from the farmers. Ash also doesn't know how to make a connection with his dad because his dad himself hasn't been trying to make a connection with his son himself. Ash also wants to be like his father so that his father can be proud of him but doesn't have the capabilities to be just like his father. With Foxy saying to his wife that his son is different while making hand gestures, it can be a symbol of going through puberty. Ash goes through a lot of emotions easily that he couldn't quite figure out himself of what he's going through on the inside. When Foxy says that towards his wife about their son, it's shot in a way that shows the disconnection Foxy has with Ash to where he doesn't know how to communicate with him. There's another scene where Felicity Fox has a talk with Ash where it's up and personal towards him to help him understand about feeling different. It's shot in a close-up position where you see her face looking at the viewers that feel personal and feel like she's also talking to the audience that it's ok to feel different.In American Beauty, Lester, played by Kevin Spacey, was just going into conformity even if he was completely hating himself for what he's doing because it's what he's used to. So when he had a sexual awakening when he comes across Angela, played by Mena Suvari, he is now doing the things that go into nonconformity. He feels alive and founds his sense of identity for what he truly is and what was wrong with him with his life and creates a bit of a new identity for himself. Everybody has their moments of trying to figure out their own sense of identity that want to be like someone else. So with Fantastic Mr. Fox, viewers can easily relate to this amazing coming-of-age film that gets people connected with the characters with such depth that everybody of all ages can enjoy that shows that anyone can be just themselves that's different.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fantastic like the Fox,"All in All a very good movie. The pictures and the art of the movie are very well made, also the animals are all in the same steel and fit perfectly in the setting... also the quotes (especially from the main character) are very concise. You can see from the camera ankles that it's a Wes Anderson movie, what makes it for me as a still young W. A. Fan even better. All in all for me a 8,65. The only thing that wasn't perfect is the logic at some points but it's a movie with speaking animals and more, so I also would say a movie like this don't has to have a completely realistic story. Is my first review and also in English.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The music choice is amazing and I have the entire score downloaded on my phone. The Beach Boys? Bobby fuller four? It's incredible. This film portrays so many emotions: feeling like the scapegoat, trying to live up to everyone's expectations, trying to mask your fear and anxiety, loving someone who's not good for your safety, acceptance, unity, love, and family. Every character is unique and you can feel what they are feeling in real time. This is a must-watch for anyone who feels ""different""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Well Done and Loads of Fun,"I watched Fantastic Mr. Fox years ago, and only recently watched it again. The high scores gave me high hopes, and it fulfilled most of my expectations.The art and stop-motion is great. It's fantastic to look at, the the stop- motion is spot-on. The scenery itself is enough to leave you wanting more.The plot is, although feeling rushed at points, well-paced in the end, as you realize how much there is to cover. It's unpredictable and interesting to see where the adventures of Mr. Fox takes him and his family. The new events that occur as the movie progresses don't drag out the movie at all, but I feel like it would have benefited from a longer run time.The movie is quite quirky and has plenty of exaggerated scenes throughout. These scenes, although unrealistic, fit well into the universe of Fantastic Mr. Fox, and really add to the whole experience.My only complaint is that it often blatantly gives in to movie clichés that really bothered me, and as much was I wanted to call it fantastic, these scenes distracted from it. Nevertheless, I loved everything else.Overall Fantastic Mr. Fox is a heck of a lot of fun. It's well-paced, beautiful to look at, and quirky. Unfortunately it suffers from following the formula, which really distracts from the creativity of the rest of the film. Nevertheless, the movie is worth your time, and is a must-watch for any movie lover. If you did somehow dislike it, then that's really too bad. If you do enjoy it, then we're in agreement. I highly recommend you checking this one out if you haven't already.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pretentious, Dry, and Unbearable","I went in not knowing anything about this movie and I walked out in an half hour knowing everything about it. It was one of worst movies I've ever seen. I'm a generally a nice person but if somebody told me they liked this movie, I would probably never talk to them again. Anybody who likes it throughly is most likely to have an extremely dry, hermit type personality. I'm gonna also include that they think they are pretty intelligent too, just like the self-centered fart bags who do the voices for the movie. I know everyone has different types of humor, some people may not even like mine, but that's okay; I don't think this covers any range of humor though. This movie is as flat and dull as Wes Anderson's mind. Go in and get ready to walk out; it's best to get your money back too.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I liked it the first time, loved it the second","Utterly odd and unique in the best way. Sweet, funny, breezy stop motion animation film based on the Roald Dahl novel. It's always delightful, and very well voice-acted by the likes of George Clooney, Meryl Streep and Michael Gambon.A fox/father decides to settle down, stop stealing chickens and become a respectable newspaperman, but hitting a mid life crisis the part of him that longs to steal birds can't be denied one last big heist, which leads to ever more dire (and funnier) consequences.I liked the film on first viewing, but found I loved it on the second. First, for film fans, or fans of Anderson's work, it's hysterical how he has translated his personal style, both visual and character, to animation. This looks and feels like his other films in a way that is by itself an absolute crack-up. But more important it turns out that Anderson and Dahl are a great mix, with Dahl's great imagination taking Anderson's cock-eyed view of life, and expanding it to a broader canvas. In the end, while populated by puppet animals, this is as human, touching and funny as almost anything Anderson has done. It may be too sophisticated for little kids, but any child advanced enough to enjoy Dahl's books (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, etc.) should have a grand old time, along with their parents.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

From the wolf scene (all those who already watched the film will understand what I mean)to the ending 'war' scene ,all scenes which were not in the book, it is an innovative and outstanding achievement to all those involved. All those who read the book know how almost impossible it was to write a screenplay for this movie but this team succeeded with flying colours.Thank you for showing me that movies can still be an art form where originality is still somewhere to be found.

Most people found it rather odd I was comparing this film with blockbuster hits. But oh well.

Best Animated Movie Ever,"I originally watched The Fantastic Mr. Fox back in 2012 with my family, and as a toddler at the time, was enthralled by the beautiful stop motion animation, charming voice of George Clooney, and that snapping rat that makes an appearance. After this initial watch, I abstained from seeing it entirely until 2020 when I revisited Wes Anderson's animated masterpiece. Once I came back though, I fell in love.I love this movie. Everything about it from the animation, to the casting, and even the character design makes me enjoy this movie more with each watch. Wes Anderson does an excellent job making this movie rewatchable, and really hits on allowing this film to be enjoyed by all age groups. The star-studded cast in this film really adds to the story, and even smaller roles like Willem Dafoe as Rat and Eric Chase Anderson as Kristofferson shine and add to the feel of this film. Wes Anderson's stop-motion style is amazing, and the array of colors in this film add to all of the other elements that make this movie wonderful.

Wes Anderson's animation competently deserves the adjective in its title,"Wes Anderson's stop-motion puppet show, adopted from Roald Dahl's beloved children novel, has evaded from me for all these years, again, I'm not an avid animation fan and particularly into children's fare, but this winsome gem can nimbly edge into my Top 10 film of the year.Mr. Fox (Clooney) used to enjoy his adventurous life as a food-stealer with Ms. Fox (Streep), but now he is a suave columnist, they have a son Ash (Schwartzman), and lead a quiet life living underground. Nevertheless, as a wild animal, Mr. Fox cannot reconciled to the quiet life which Ms. Fox urges him to hew to, he purchases a new tree house regardless of his lawyer Mr. Badger (Murray)'s persuasion because three meanest human farmers are living nearby. Later Mr. Fox's teenage nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) comes to stay with them, whose athletic bent walks away with Mr. Fox's commendation and leaves a gauche Ash pale in comparison.Recruiting an opossum Kylie (Wolodarsky) as his aide, Mr. Fox plots one-last-raid to the three farmers' respective lands on the sly, which ultimately provokes the farmers' vengeance, lead by Franklin Bean (Gambon), the meanest of them all, and endangers other species as well. Together, animals need to use their instinct to fight back and Mr. Fox must retrieve his tail which he has lost in an ambush, now becomes a fur tie wearing by Bean as a victorious token and rescue Kristofferson who is captured as a hostage.With all the animals sport an American accent whereas the evil humans with British accent, Anderson chirpily brings the mischievous pettiness into the film's autumnal palette, the story has its whimsical focus on retaining one's natural disposition and a correct upbringing every child should receive. Visually speaking, this animation has its quintessential Andersonian opulence, its symmetrical and miniature frame arrangement promisingly augurs his auteurist consummation in MOONRISE KINGDOM (2012) and THE GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL (2014). So is his characterisation of the assorted anthropomorphic critters, mostly foxes and rodents, and the only villain among them is Willem Dafoe voices the rat, Mr. Fox's nemesis. When Mr. Fox and his cohort meets a wolf on their way, he must overcome his deepest fear since his inherent phobia of wolves, and Anderson lends the story such a philosophical angle of exhortation, throws in conspicuous adulthood sophistication onto the family-friendly template.For those who anticipate a more dramatic showdown, Anderson doesn't accommodate itself into a traditional story-unwinding, the film doesn't end in a thorough and edge-of-the- seat payoff, alternatively, Anderson blasé care-freeness finishes this endearing tale with a ""we want it more"" note. The cast is pretty fetching, it is Clooney's first voice performance and he is plain fitting, but a quite despondent fact is that Streep can only pair with Clooney as a couple in an animation, in the world of live-action, it will never happen, not in a billion years. All in all, it is rather dismissive to category Anderson's work as a cartoon for kids, it competently deserves the adjective in its title and is a steadfast stepping stone for Anderson's propitious standing in Hollywood's hierarchy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Far From Fantastic, but a bit of a hoot!","Fantastic Mr. Fox had it's British elements torn from the roots, butchered, Americanised, and in result of this we get to see the laziest stop motion displayed in cinema history. If you watch Nick Park's work on Wallace & Gromit, there is so much charm because of the attention to detail. This really does look rushed, and when ever there is a adventure or action sequences the camera cuts miles back so you can only just make out the card board cut outs. Wes Anderson could argue it's for effect, but perhaps all the budget went into it's divine A-list voice cast that there was just no money or time put in it's appearance. It doesn't look cute, in fact at times it's almost disturbing. The voice cast are fine here, the only problem is that there is just no need for these big names. Someone 10 times cheaper than George Clooney could have pulled off Fox's vocal chords with out breaking a sweat. It's just one massive marketing technique. The only voice actor here that was so vital to the film is Jason Schwartzman, his delivery is where the movie get's its greatest comedic injection.Having said all this, this isn't particularly a bad movie at all. It's really well write and the dialogue is charming a very witty. Never laugh out loud hilarious, but it keeps the viewer much more interested, seeming so there's not much else to fall back on. The plot, although taken from the novel, still isn't great, but things do pick up in the last couple of acts and as annoying and frightening it may look, it is still entertaining. It's adult for kids, to kiddie for adults, Mr. Fox really can't settle a target audience and really can't hold a worthy contender for the Best Animation Film.Overall: Far from fantastic, but it's quirky, cooky and a bit of a hoot.

A Cuss of a Good Film,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is a thoroughly enjoyable movie.I am a big fan of stop motion animation, but that medium is not universally enjoyed. This is one of the best stop motion movies I have ever seen, and it is clear that a tremendous amount of effort was put into it.Stop motion is a difficult medium of filmmaking, with each frame needing to be individually posed which can cause movement to appear unnatural. However this film manages to avoid this at most points. The places where flaws are most noticeable are also scenes in which it is intentional. It's clear a great deal of care was put into this movie with each model being beautifully detailed and even somewhat informative of the characters personality.The camerawork is surprisingly good for a stop motion movie and feels as fluid as a traditional movie. The great camerawork coupled with the lovely scenery work together to create a movie that is visually stunning for a stop motion film.Despite the great detail to the visuals, the best aspect of this movie is possibly the writing. The plot is fairly straightforward, with the main characters having at least some form of development. In this case the simplicity works well, as it provides a means for the character motivation and development.The movie is accessible to all ages, and works well as a family movie, but unlike many movies of that type is not simply a children's movie. The movie handles many concepts (which other family movies may shy away from) in a charming way. For example: the word ""cuss"" is used in place of any potential harsh language. As someone who doesn't like the sanitization of children's media, I actually felt this was a great substitution. Rather than remove the effectiveness of swearing in language, the substitution makes it acceptable for younger children but not boring for older audiences. I was actually quite impressed by the balance achieved between media for younger audiences and older audiences.One of the strongest aspects of this movie, is its accessibility. Most people could find something to enjoy in this movie, but in the most genuine way possible. Many movies which try this end up lacking direction or become annoyingly predictable, yet Fantastic Mr Fox does not fall into this trap. This is achieved through the family dynamic, which is both believably complex yet easy to understand.Ultimately this movie offers an enjoyable family experience, and its family status does not cheapen the experience for watching it outside of the family setting.Final score: 96/100",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Extremely intelligent family movie,"While Fantastic Mr. Fox is quite definitely Wes Anderson's most commercial film so far, it treads the line between Hollywood and art-house surprisingly well, and manages to be an extremely intelligent family movie in the strictest meaning of the term - a movie to be enjoyed by both children and adults, each on a different levels. Kids will enjoy every minute, and adults will enjoy it more because they'll understand it more (watch Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are for a failed attempt at achieving that very balance). With terrific voice talents and wonderful animation, this is one of the most truly enjoyable films I've seen in a long time, and at this point I'd like to point out that I didn't use the word 'fantastic' once in this review; I'd like a reward please.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Fantastic Mr. Fox""","Wes Anderson's ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is a different breed of animated film. It bares a disarming emotional maturity coupled with a sweetly mischievous cartoony vitality that both renews my faith in Anderson as a director and reaffirms 2009 as a hell of a year for animation.Things were admittedly getting rocky between the indie auteur and I. ""The Royal Tenenbaums,"" the perfect nexus of Anderson's flamboyant cinematic technique, borderline obsessive-compulsive art direction, and satirically bourgeois humor, was proceeded by two films with all the technical and artistic flare of his best work, though his families of dryly depressive characters, often portrayed by a stock catalogue of recycled actors, began feeling increasingly redundant and masturbatory. His follow-up to ""Tenenbaums"" was ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,"" a puzzlingly defended film distinguished by breathtaking visuals, smarmy caricatures, and unrepentant vacuity. 2007's ""Darjeeling Limited"" surpassed that film in substance, but Anderson still felt like he was running on fumes, incapable of a single wholly original character or relationship. For his grandiose symmetrical photography and audacious camera-work, the guy could be a dead ringer for Kubrick if his stories were up to snuff. Anderson needed a change, and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is everything he and his audience could have hoped for.It's not just that the film revels in gorgeous traditional stop-motion claymation, rich with its tactile textures and charmingly rippling fur, or the magnanimity of the miniature set-pieces, or backdrops lit with the deep auburns and siennas of perpetual sunset. ""Mr. Fox"" has a story, and a pretty good one at that, courtesy children's author Roald Dahl, adapted for the screen by Anderson and Noah Baumbach. The director's meticulous perfectionism actually feels more at home in the world of animation, which from inception presents the heightened reality he strives for. The dolly shots and intricate sets suddenly service the storytelling rather than primp Anderson's aggressive showmanship.But contrary to what the exuberant color palette and genial clay critters might suggest, ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is not really a film geared to young children, though they'll no doubt appreciate it for the animalistic silliness and amiable pace. Rather it's the subtext, Mr. Fox (George Clooney) and his midlife crisis, which will resonate most with adults. The film has a surprising amount to say about our own animal nature through the anthropomorphizing of its critters, who will frequently drop their civilized countenances to hiss or snarl or gobble down food, but which somehow makes them feel all the more relatable.Case in point, Mr. Fox gives up his danger-prone life of killing chickens to raise a family (taking up a more pedestrian gig in the field of--gag!--journalism), but finds himself drawn back to his life's modus operandi for 'one last big score.' Dahl and Anderson are not afraid to portray unpleasantness, nor do they gloss over the fact that Mr. Fox does some not- especially-nice things to the birds he catches. The film never talks down to a potentially younger audience, and the difference is immediately refreshing when compared to children's films that are merely content to cast nasty creatures as pleasant surrogate humans.""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" is the deepest animated movie of the year, and I think the best, if only by a hair. ""The Princess and the Frog"" is a serious contender as well, though being a fairy tale, it often doesn't pack the punch or offer the rewarding surprises Wes Anderson's film does. It actually shares more in common with Spike Jonze's ""Where the Wild Things Are"" than this year's Disney, Pixar, or Dreamworks efforts. ""Mr. Fox"" is more effortlessly charming and poignant that that commendable film, and holds its own among the year's best live action as well. It's a film that pairs adventure with a markedly fresh family drama, tenderness and love with the unpredictable and the untamed.In short, it's a wild animal.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Fantastic Mr. Fox Review,"I am finishing up reviewing every Wes Anderson film and this is one of the easiest 10/10 ratings I ever had to give.Fantastic Mr. Fox is a perfect example of Wes Anderson's fun loving, darkly comedic style. This film is a beauty to look at, each character and setting is beautifully lit and presented in a perfect frame. It really goes along with the source material that Roald Dahl created years ago.The comedy which is something that Wes Anderson excels at it at top notch, I laugh at every single joke, whether it be supported by the quick whip pans or smash zooms or just great delivery of dialogue, I am on the floor laughing. The acting is also a great element in this film, George Clooney and Meryl Streep shine as the Fox mother and father, you feel they are real, even though it is an animation.Speaking of Animation, this films stop motion is revolutionary. It is perfect, it also is the perfect kind of medium for Wes Anderson's tightly constructed atheistic. The movements are funny and alive, and the way they create these worlds feel large but, also comfy and homey.All these things are great but, what stands out is Wes Anderson's ability to bring heart and a message into the film. It talks about growing up, making your family proud, and trying to find your own way. The film will touch everyone from age 1 to 100.An amazing masterpiece 10/10 and 5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An animation style all it's own, and to back it up, great characters.","Wes Anderson has been criticized for his works being too slow, and not funny enough, and for a variety of things. Like all of his other films, this is unmistakably a Wes Anderson film through and through, with offbeat characters, and quietly funny scenes, and subtle character development. This movie is quite subtle in the jokes and in a lot of lines, so children may or may not understand different parts of the film to be funny, but even if they don't they'll be dazzled by the odd, but amazing looking animation.Mr. Fox (George Clooney) has to give up his life as a chicken thief once he finds out Mrs. Felicity Fox (Meryl Streep) is pregnant. Two human years later he's working as a newspaper columnist to feed his wife and his not so athletic son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman). Mr. Fox, being the wild animal that he is, grows tired of his mundane life and along with his buddy Kylie (Wallace Wolodarsky), he begins robbing farms again, which angers three farmers who are dead set on killing Mr. Fox. Meanwhile, Fox's athletic nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) moves in and makes Ash jealous. Chaos ensues throughout.This movie's animation style is a style of it's own. It's stop motion animated, and has that extra dimension because of this, but instead of making all kinds of wide sets to put the characters on, everything is flat. This movie at times resembles a traditionally drawn cartoon, because of it's flat animation. That sounds like a bad thing, but it is actually very unique and great to look at. The sets and the characters and everything just look amazing.Character development is subtle...especially to kids. It will definitely either be very subtle or fly over kids' heads altogether. One scene Ash in mean to Kristofferson because he's jealous, and they bond silently over the running of a toy train. It's a sweet scene, but again development is quiet and implied. Another scene (not giving away any spoilers here), where the simple response of a creature after a long speech is to raise it's arm in an agreeing manner, is also quiet but meaningful.Problems with this movie range from some bouts of ""humorous"" dialogue that aren't overly hilarious, to strange character quirks that have you puzzled until the end, but it's still a well done, original and entertaining family film. Director/writer Wes Anderson did a good job writing like himself but keeping the Roald Dahl touch in there.My rating: *** out of ****. 90 mins. PG for fake cussing, drinking and smoking (Yeah, that's right, movies are rated up for smoking now!)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Roald Dahl must be spinning in his grave over this travesty.,"Roald Dahl must be spinning in his grave over this travesty.The quality of the actual animation is pretty good if unfortunately corrupted by ludicrous Americanisms that simply do not fit with the character of the animation, unfortunately nothing else in the movie was even close to good, the casting was wrong and completely altered the characters, in fact it has very little past the names of the main characters in common with the Roald Dahl book. The one star is purely for the animation, the animation is possibly worth more than that, but the rest of this disaster drags it down. Sadly the much loved original story has been utterly destroyed, by what has to be one of the worst screenplay rewrites ever!. To sum it up truly awful.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic,"Wes Anderson returns this weekend with another Roald Dahl book, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar. My timing on seeing Fantastic Mr. Fox for the first time is believe it-or-not, purely coincidental. Talk about clairvoyant! This is Wes Anderson's first attempt at animation, and like Isle of Dogs, this is the medium in which his quirky, kaleidoscopic view of the world really comes alive. This is a gorgeously created animated movie, and it's painfully hilarious. You will laugh more times than you'd might expect, especially as an adult. I'm not convinced that this was made for families at all, but it's a beloved children's novel and though Wes Anderson typically caters to a mature audience, he honors the gentle roots of the story. What's better is that Fantastic Mr. Fox seems entirely self-aware that it's a Wes Anderson movie and knows how odd it's supposed to look and feel. In that sense, it goes for broke in absurdist humor and keeps upping ante from scene to scene. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Wes doesn't do enough of these!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Anderson just Wes as if we are good friends, and we are.. in a sense). i would say that Mr. Fox was a kind of middle ground between early Wes and, i don't know, mature Wes? i guess so. his mature style started to grow its roots with The Darjeeling Limited then grew into Fantastic Mr. Fox, got stronger with Moonrise Kingdom and peaked with The Grand Budapest Hotel. and Mr. Fox is so important in this journey i think.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

a great story abounding with odd comedic touches and a spark of melodrama thrown inbetween,"Don't even try to deny that 2009 was the year of animation. This is another great animated movie that happens to invigorate its director's career. Based on Roald Dahl's classic, Fantastic Mr. Fox infiltrates Wes Anderson's trademark quirky blend of humor into a gripping narrative. While the material might be too snarky and sophisticated for children, adults should enjoy Anderson's refreshing approach. The movie's look is pleasantly off-beat, yet imaginative with superbly designed characters and sweet ingenious action pieces. The truly extraordinary world created on screen is incredibly detailed and resonates with Anderson's style very well. Apart from being a sheer delight to watch, Fantastic Mr. Fox stands as a great story abounding with odd comedic touches and a spark of melodrama thrown inbetween.

Whimsical & Charming,"Mr. Fox promises to settle down and help raise a family, but it conflicts with the truth he is trying to tell Mrs. Fox about himself. The truth is that a fox cannot be happy without a chicken in its teeth. A fox courts danger, hunts prey, outsmarts other predators and has thrilling adventures. This is what a fox is good at. The promise and truth collide as Mr. Fox returns to the wild, carefree days of youth. Worse yet, a trio of vengeful farmers threaten to wipe out an entire community of animals to catch a fox. The animals look to their individual strengths and differences in order to survive.This whimsical, charming and brilliant stop-motion feature is delightful from beginning to end. Each frame is a treasure in terms of artistry, revelations of human (and wild animal) nature, intriguing themes and characters, wry humor, compelling stories and more. There is more going on than appears on the surface. The conflicts are as interesting and revealing as the resolutions. George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson give voice and life to Roald Dahl's characters.

Best comedy of 2009!,"When I first heard word of Wes Anderson adapting one of Roald Dahl's books I of course instantly was both interested and concerned. Being a Houstonian I have always felt inclined to support the work of Houston-born writer/director Wes Anderson.Thus far I've enjoyed his dry sense of humor; kind of like an Americanized version of British humor...but it is also very adult, sophisticated humor, so I couldn't imagine him doing a family movie.After seeing the movie I have one thing to say...Fantastic Mr. Fox certainly is FANTASTIC! Wes Anderson has made one of the best films of 2009; one that is just as good as his other movies, if not being his best yet! Everything, from voice-actors, to the use of stop animation: this film is perfectly balanced in what is certainly the best comedy of the year.How did Wes Anderson pull it off? Well, he honestly didn't make this so much as a kid's movie as he did make another entry in his series of odd-ball comedies- only this time cutting back mature subjects to a PG-rating. What results is a very mature comedy that doesn't resort to cheap gimmicks or slapstick for laughs (though there is a bit of slapstick for those kids who won't understand the humor in Anderson's dialog).The story centers on Mr. Fox (voiced by the always entertaining George Clooney), who is the foxiest fox who ever foxed. An expert chicken thief he likes living dangerously...that is until his lover (voiced by Meryl Streep) becomes pregnant and demands that they settle down. After getting caught in a fox trap he agrees to her terms that if they survive he shall never steal again.Two years later (which is far more in fox years) the couple is living in a hole with their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzmen). Mr. Fox is a newspaper columnist, who is fairly certain no one actual reads his column and is now upset that he won't amount to anything (like his father) so he decides they must move out. His choice is a tree, but this tree happens to be located next door to the three meanest farmers the animals have ever seen. His lawyer, Badger (voiced by Anderson regular Bill Murray) tries to talk Fox out of his choice home, but he won't hear it.After moving to the tree they are joined by their nephew Kristofferson (voiced by Eric Chase Anderson) who quickly becomes Ash's center of jealousy. Kristofferson is perfect in just about every way, spending his time meditating while practicing yoga, being naturally gifted in sports - everything Ash wishes he was.But while those trivial matters go on Mr. Fox can't resist the call of the wild, and with his opossum building superintendent, Kylie (voiced by Wallace Wolodarsky) plans a return to his dangerous life of ""cussing with"" the farmers' heads. At first this starts as simple crimes, but soon the farmers declare war against Mr. Fox and the entire animal populace! It becomes the job of Fox save everyone from the farmers' wrath...which he caused!There's also a great (not to mention HILARIOUS) bit involving Willem Dafoe as an insane, finger snapping rat-henchman under the employ of the farmers, but I wouldn't spoil that for the you! You'll have to see the movie to get what I'm talking bout.Fantastic Mr. Fox of course differs from its source material, but for what it is Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great comedy. I say ""comedy"" instead of ""animation"" or ""Family"" movie because its values really are more comedy oriented than they are trying to entertain an entire group of people. In fact, the theater I saw this movie in was full of kids under the age of 10 and very seldom did any of them laugh: the humor was just way over their heads, and I won't hold that against them.For adults and mat kids over the age of 10 or so Fantastic Mr. Fox is a fantasy comedy full of whimsical characters that will leave them chuckling, and quoting its ingenious script long after they've left the theater. Parents can also approve of the film's message of ""everyone has their own individual talents,"" be it thief, landscape artist, or demolitions expert.It won't stand up against a movie like Pixar's Up in a 'Best Animated Feature' contest, but then again I doubt it was even trying to. What the movie does is set out to be a sophisticated comedy - something that is rated PG, but is just as good as any comedy directly aimed at older audiences. Fantastic Mr. Fox is rated PG but is more adult and sophisticated than this year's smash hit The Hangover.Fantastic Mr. Fox truly is the most fantastic movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A very human, animal story","I don't generally like slow motion movies, but I really loved this one. Not just the animals, but the scenario was a piece of art: always giving you the feeling of an eternal autum.
What I think is also remarkable about this movie is how it combines the humanization of the animals characters with their wild nature. These two natures are always in balance in this movie, so the spectator doesn't forget that while acting just like humans, they don't stop being wild creatures. This film reminds you that even if we live in a civilization with many rules, we have dreams and deep desires that we must satisfy. That is something that every person needs to do at some point of their lives, and that is what Mr. Fox does.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Colored, fun stop motion","Mr. Fox is a fox who has a family and is now bored with his life and wants to return to hunting by stealing livestock from three local farmers. Unlucky, the three farmers are now attacking Mr. Fox and its environmental community.Fantastic Mr. Fox is a film with an interesting story combined with a game of color dominance from Wes Anderson's work. Fantastic Mr. Fox has interesting stories and conflicts and it's fun to see how the animals try to save themselves from being chased by humans. Sense of humor is also not separated from this film. It's just that the dialogue is presented so fast that it is rather difficult to catch the message conveyed. The film's fast tempo also provides a bit of an obstacle to enjoying this film.Filled with famous names such as George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Bill Muray, Owen Wilson is able to provide a voice that has the soul and emotion of every character he plays.It is Wes Anderson's trademark to play colorfully.

Something for everyone,"2009 was a great year for animated movies - first the excellent ""Up"", now this sweet, beautiful, feel-good movie.Wes Anderson, director of such modern classics as Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore, takes a Roald Dahl novel, and makes a superb movie out of it.Funny, witty, perfectly-paced, the plot and direction are spot-on. The animation is great and the choice of actors for the voices was inspired. George Clooney as Mr Fox is suave and sophisticated yet impishly naughty. Meryl Streep adds gravitas and motherly concern as Mrs Fox. Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, ever-present in Wes Anderson movies, are perfect for their roles as the kid fox and the wise-cracking badger- lawyer, respectively. Even the minor parts have major names: Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe and Michael Gambon plus Jarvis Cocker (lead-singer of Pulp, in case you didn't know) as the folk-singing sidekick of one of the villains!All this, and then Wes Anderson's customary perfectly-chosen rocking soundtrack.It may be animated, but this isn't just for kids - it has something for everyone.

Fantastic Mr. Fox,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is a quirky, fun, and feel good stop motion movie and delivers a engrossing story but even more so it's a stunning piece of art. Wes has his style, and it shines even more in stop motion with increased freedom. Though I do think it could've been more playful at times.Visually there are just so many shots here that feel like you're looking at a painting. The cinematography is incredible, and it holds up due to the choice to not overuse CGI, of which there is only one shot or so. The interiors, the characters, there's details to enjoy everywhere.Characters/props/design. Incredible, the three 3 farmers are my absolute favorite. So much character, but also charm. Honestly.. I liked the foxes. But I loved the design of the humans. I kept wishing for more scenes with them, the town scene was the cherry on top. The interiors are stunning, the opening scenes with the three farmers, typical Wes but also so perfect for this movie. It just manages to encapsulate so many things, capture so much detail, at a quick pace. The foxes are great too of course, the clothes, all lovely. I can go on but there's nothing bad here. It's all fantastic.Music was nice, very fitting and light/happy tones. Some similar/same tracks that I've heard in previous Wes films. Which was slightly nostalgic. But also made this move stand out a little less. I wish it had a more distinct sound to go along with it.Voices are really well cast. Clooney has that lovable warmth. Schartzman was great, I loved his line delivery. Murray was good as always and standout was Dafoe with the Rat. Really fun scenes.

Wes' Idiosyncrasies Animated,"Not since ""Bottle Rocket"", ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" have I enjoyed Anderson's work. The animation is captivating. The plot revolves around a fox who breaks a promise to his wife and continues to raid three local farmers for chickens because it's his natural instinct. The farmers decide to unite and put an end to the culprit once and for all which endangers the fox's family and friends. At this point the fox's natural instinct for survival kicks in and he cleverly sets out a plan to save his loved ones. This movie is clever, witty, quirky, heartwarming and insightful. It contains all of Anderson's idiosyncrasies. I believe Anderson is asking why do we act on some of our natural human instincts? Why can't we resist and be willing to change? I do enjoy all of his works, this is a fun filled joy ride and ranks at the top of his masterful artwork.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A brilliant adaption and a film that is, dare I say it, fantastic","Wes Anderson is an interesting figure. Maybe you've heard of him, maybe you haven't, but one things for certain: his works are amazingly unique. Sure, films like The Life Aquatic lack the coherence of other works such as Moonrise Kingdom, Fantastic Mr. Fox (hey!), and The Grand Budapest Hotel, but even at his worst, it's easy to find at least one thing to adore about his films. Now enter Roald Dahl. A prominent writer of books for Children (although, they do certainly still hold appeal to those older) who sadly passed around 2 decades ago, his style is a perfect blend of quirky. The way he tells his stories is so ingenious, and the same could be said about the characters that inhabit those little worlds. A Roald Dahl adaption by Wes Anderson is not something I realized was a match made in heaven until I saw Fantastic Mr.Fox, which, like the first word of it's title, is a kids film that should not be ignored.Wes Anderson is a mastermind when it comes to cinematography, and surprisingly, the same could be said about his hand in Stop-Motion Animation. The environments here are amazingly done, and the tone they convey is so perfect. It may be a quirky, up-lifting piece targeted at the little ones, but each location oozes atmosphere in a charming way. The presentation is nothing short of amazing, and, as typical with Wes Anderson pieces, melds so well with what happens on screen that it doesn't become a part of the movie you don't really notice, it essentially becomes a key point to notice when viewing. The animation on display is also outstanding. Puppet movement is never chunky enough for you to laugh at it for the wrong reasons, but the puppets themselves are silly enough for you to laugh at it for reasons that display just how much fun everybody invested had.Enough about the style, what about the substance? First off, the performances. There are few performances that would crumble a movie should they not be in the final product, and there are few examples that stand out to me more than George Clooney as Mr.Fox. His voice work matches up with the animation so well that I struggled at moments to envision him hunched over a microphone recording the lines given to him. Every line is said with attitude that fits deeply with the character, the enthusiasm and emotion is present to a point where it is no longer just a man pretending to be a fox puppet in some studio, but rather, a man who IS a fox puppet (as weird as that may sound). As for the rest of the performances, also amazing. I never heard a voice that I thought didn't match up with what I was seeing, and everybody in the cast seemed to enjoy what they were doing just so much. I never quite heard a voice that sounded weak, droopy, and bored.And then there's the writing. In my opinion, this is one of the best Wes Anderson films, even if it wasn't technically filmed in the traditional sense. The script, which he wrote with Noah Baumbach, is filled to the brim with charm, humor, and fun. The lines never came out as cheesy to me, and anything that might come remotely close is great, regardless. The real question that remains in a potential viewers head for an adaption, however, is simple: 'how faithful is this to it's source material?'. The book itself, which I haven't read myself in many years, is amazing, and though this film does add bits and pieces to that already established narrative, none of those bits and pieces never seemed to find a way to mess with what should be amazing. Dahl's quirky charm is almost on point with Anderson's, which works wonders as anything not originally there certainly feels like it could have been.Maybe a 10 is too generous, (I don't always see a fault where there are some, after all) but I really do think that Fantastic Mr.Fox is an excellent gateway to the works of Wes Anderson, one that excels greatly as a film itself. It's animation is, in layman's terms, brilliant, and it's perfect presentation fits that quite well. It oozes charm, and it's performances, especially that of Mr.Clooney, are notable as well. It's a brilliant adaption and a film that is, dare I say it, fantastic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Boring Mr. Fox,"I only gave it two stars because they did a decent job with the stop-motion animation. I won't compare it with the Roald Dahl book which I never read, but it doesn't make a difference, The movie was charmless and so bland and boring I bailed after twenty minutes. I doubt even little kids would enjoy this.So what happens? Mr. And Mrs. Fox are at a farm, first conversing, then stealing a squab from it. Then Mr. Fox sees a trap and gets curious and ends up trapping himself and his wife in it. Then all of a sudden, two years pass (no explanation of how they got out of the trap) and they have an adolescent son, then they have a young cousin visit when his father is ill. In the meantime, Mr. Fox got a job in the newspapers and they move from their old hole into a tree home, even though they are located near disreputable farmers.My description makes the movie sound more interesting than it actually was. Where there should have been laughs and/or excitement, there are none.

Is's all been done before, and this movie really shows it.The animations was good, and some of the jokes were funny, but it was predictable. The story is not driven forward by anything, and the plot is to loose to be captive.

"Boring, unfunny and inappropriate","I haven't read the book that this movie is supposedly based on but I was looking for a family movie and the many highly rated reviews convinced me to try this. The animation is well done; it's a pity that the rest of the movie isn't very good.The story is an Americanized run-of-the-mill heist story, pretty dull and uninspiring. It's hard to understand who the target audience was; the story is made up of (among other things): marriage problems, references to Mrs. Fox's mating behavior, planning a heist, and other adult topics. The characters cuss by using the word ""cuss"" that seems innocent on the surface but once ""cuss"" is being used in the context of cuss words, it just becomes a cuss word itself. Definitely not something that I'd want my kid to watch but it's also boring and uninteresting to me - if I want to watch an action movie, I won't reach for this one.I like George Clooney in general but his bored ""Ocean's Eleven"" voice is badly miscast and is a net negative for the movie. The other voices aren't significantly better even though the voice case is decent.The whole thing is unremarkable - the animation style could've been used to make an interesting, funny movie but this one isn't it. I'd suggest looking for something else.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Quirky stop motion adventure,"I used to love reading Roald Dahl's stories when I was a kid, so this stop motion version of one of his favourite works intrigued me. Also, I'd never seen a Wes Anderson film before, so I was eager to see what all the fuss was about surrounding this maverick director.My feelings about FANTASTIC MR. FOX are mixed. There are many elements of the original story present and correct here, but at the same time the story has been muddled and become very Americanised. I don't mind the fact that the animals have American accents (George Clooney et al) but I hate the intrusive pop music that keeps playing on the soundtrack in order to evoke emotion - I always despise films that play this cheap trick.The heart of the story - humans vs. animals - is a good one and there are a lot of funny and quirky moments, but other parts of the film left me cold. The characters of the young foxes are played by a couple of adult voice actors and the effect is a distinctly odd, and slightly creepy, one. Still, it's not all bad, and it's hard to dislike a film that utilises so much stop motion as this one does.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Strange Film,"I really can't imagine who liked this film, that it has such a high rating. My grandson watched for about 5 minutes before he went back to playing with his cars. I lasted maybe 20 minutes, before I turned it off. The animation is really weird; all jerky and something about it was just creepy. It made me uncomfortable, and looked like some kid made it in their basement. The story itself was boring and uninteresting. George Clooney sounded okay, Owen Wilson sounded odd, could hardly recognize Bill Murray, and Meryl Streep sounded like she was half asleep. Couldn't recognize anyone else, but they all sounded pretty bored. Don't waste your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic movie. Until,"Fantastic movie. Until around the time Wes Anderson starts adding up his ""fantastic"" ideas to the original story from the book (which is around the time when the animals start digging in the middle of the picture). There are also some major changes even from the get go, but that first half is really something both enjoyable and clever. But then this out of ordinary and interesting stop motion picture goes down the drain, turning into yet another boring and somewhat stupid animation; with a climax (of this stupidity) in a form of jumping a fence on a motorcycle, by using a ramp that was placed there apparently for no logical reason. Yeah, let us just turn this movie into shallow action comedyAfter witnessing that jump scene, no sane film enthusiast should dare to speak of this cinematic endeavor in terms of having a proper script. But than again: what else can you expect from Wes Anderson, that ""artistic"" writer-slash-director?",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
why is it americanised?,"Roald Dahl was British why was his book so horribly Americanised? Everything was so far removed from the book, everything that made this book great was it's British-ness that was erased from this ""movie"".And what was with the unnecessary scenes that were supposed to be funny? Maybe this is what constitutes as funny in america? And the unnecessary dialogue, and big words especially that coming from the once ""fantastic"" Mr Fox. This is supposed to be a film for children. NOT existential tossers.If you want your children to be bored longer than necessary which is about an hour and thirty minutes then, do NOT watch.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable but overrated,"Neither fantastic nor a flop, Wes Anderson?s infringement on Nick Park?s (?Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit) stop motion animation territory presents an uneven mix of elements. Extrapolating from Roald Dahl?s children book the film mixes some concepts the kids will find confusing (Felicity Fox announces she is ?pregnant? twice and Mr. Fox has an ?existential crisis?) with elongated frantic chase scenes, many in tunnels, which eventually get tiresome for the adults. Mr. Fox kills ?Rat? on screen in an extended scene but during his killing of squabs and chickens the camera demurely looks away. Ultimate both constituents will find the film entertaining but unmemorable. There is a lot to like here, however, Clooney is pitch perfect as the self-centered Mr. Fox and Willem Dafoe dials up his trademarked brand of creepiness to the extent that you are happy to see the end of Rat. Anderson?s detailed set decoration lends a needed air of realism but his animation skills are not in the same league in terms of rendering characters attractive and endearing as Nick Park. In short, walk but don?t run to see it with the kids and be prepared to do some explaining.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
More for adults than kids,"Having read the Roald Dahl book with my kids, I was looking forward to seeing this film.The movie has a lot of good points: the animation and creative details in the sets are fantastic. Clooney and Murray are both very funny - I thought Meryl Streep was pretty flat. A lot of the visual gags and the witty, modern script is funny for adult viewers.I have 2 beefs with this movie: 1) It strays very far from the tone and conception of the book. Probably any attempt to turn a short children's book into 90 minutes of screen time requires lots of padding, extra characters, story, and scenes. The characters are all turned into hip modern (sub)urbanites. If you haven't read the book, this won't bother you.2) This film is marketed as a kids movie, or at least ""family-friendly"". Unless you're comfortable with a lot of transparently-veiled swearing, you may conclude (as I have) that this movie is not for family viewing. As stated in the parent's guide, ""Instead of using profanity, characters say sentences that would contain a swear word, but the word is replaced by the word ""cuss"". What is not stated is that not 5 minutes goes by in this movie without a swear replacing ""cuss"" for f*** (apparently Anderson has an infatuation for the f-word). Also, the characters use the same tone and inflection as if they were really swearing - ""What the cuss!?"" ""cluster-cuss"", etc. The ratings board was really asleep at the wheel giving this film a PG rating with all the transparent swearing going on. Ruined an otherwise good movie for me.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
I just don't know?,"It's interesting to see the treatment that this story has been given. I think that if I'd been making it, I probably would have gone more along lines of 'The Snowman' (1982) and 'Father Christmas' (1992), but that is purely based on the small fractured elements I can remember of it from my childhood. My Mother used to keep reading after I fell asleep, so I probably missed quite a lot of it.It also seems quite unusual for it to have been made with stop-motion animation, especially when you consider when it was released. The style feels quite old fashioned in a world of CGI, but I wish there was more of it. Give me more Wallace & Gromit! Make Bob The Builder, Postman Pat and Fireman Sam proper again!I can't wait for viewers and filmmakers alike to realise that everything has balance and that their is room for all animation styles. The Oscars will have to have categories for Claymation films, Cartoons, CGI and Stop Motion because there will be so much variety and they will all be good and the world will be a better place of happy kids films with morals!Other than that, it's really not quite the way that I remember it. It's definitely got Wes Anderson's stamp on it and I don't mind that at all. There are some very clever bits, funny quirks and oddments and the characters personalities have all been carefully thought out, not to mention the superb voice acting from a stellar cast.It is quite cute in its way, if a little radicalised, but I just don't know how I feel about it.They have modernised it well and I like the way they say ""Cuss"" instead of actually cussing, but then there are also some slightly scary elements too, especially Bean, played too brilliantly by Michael Gambon.I think perhaps that like a lot of Wes' films, you need to be in the right frame of mind to watch them and with the right company. When I first watched 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' (2014) with friends I was in hysterics, but on its second viewing with the Mothership, it didn't seem to hit the same notes.Maybe this one would be more fun if I was watching with a younger audience, although mature would never be a word that I would use to describe my Mother or her filmic tastes.As I am in turmoil about my thoughts on this film, it has made it hard to score. It is almost in a category of it's own and certainly difficult to compare to the collection of films that I have on my list.I know I don't hate it, but I can't confirm that I liked it either, it's a tad Marmite like that.502.02/1000.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A delightful and charming film,"Fantastic Mr. Fox was a very delightful and charming film. It is a film that perhaps young children will not understand or be interested in, but it has a lot of intelligence put into it. The voice performances were fantastic, as was the animation. At times though I could not help but admire the film more than enjoy it, since I thought that at times I was not entertained by it so much. But since it has some very quotable lines and upbeat music unlike any other animated film, props have to be given to it. I have only seen three animated films, this, Up,, and Coraline, and cannot rank any of them. To me, any of them are worthy of winning the Best Animated Feature Oscar, and I do hope they all get nominated. Overall, a pleasing film.",,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic Mr. Fox,"Wes Anderson creates another film, that did poorly at the box office, but was a fantastic film. The film comes off weird, but a couple minutes in, you'll be loving the whole vibe. The oddness of the characters, the animation, and the music all gives it a tone that you think would be off putting but is one of the most refreshing takes on a movie in a while.Mr. Fox (Clooney) promises his lovely wife (Streep)that he will stop stealing, in light of getting caught red handed. George Clooney, Meryl Streep and small parts from Anderson usual's, Murray and Wilson make up the extraordinary cast. The characters are unique and develop throughout the film. Mr. Fox is a animal trying to find freedom from his boring, monotonous day, and Badger is a hot-headed lawyer. The writing is top notch, and never gets boring, and the music is perfect for the movie. There is constantly ambiance noises (they recorded voices outside in a forest) like birds and crickets. But best of all is the animation. The whole film is brought to life by this. I can not express how great this was, and previews don't do it justice.The film has a deeper meaning (every one has an animal in them) and you will not leave the movie unaffected.",,Anonymous,Animation
What the cuss is going on here?,"This Roald Dahl film was a ""truly"" entertaining film to watch. The animation was a spectacle and truly captures the works of Wes Anderson. The Fantastic Mr. Fox examines takes you into the world on a clan of animals all in a stop motion animation flick. The facial expressions and attention to detail was superb and original. The lighting of the film along with its animation brings out the characteristics in each of the animals. The close ups and spot light effect on the animals were fun and detailed. The world of Fantastic Mr. Fox brings you to an intelligent and clever set of animals that are quite sophisticated and hold various careers. George Clooney is the main character and is the reason for all the good and bad results for his friends and family. He yearns to be wild and untamed but is restricted by society. George Clooney has such a unique voice that warms you up and wants to like him. This smooth talking fox moved his family to tree in a more dangerous neighborhood, not taking advice from his lawyer, Bill Murray, the Badger. What makes it dangerous is the location to Boggis, Bunce, and Bean, the local farmers to the area. Facing hardships and greed, Fox tries to make a better life, steals from the farmers and gets his clan in and out of trouble. His nephew comes over when they are movie into the tree fox. Kristofferson ends up being captured trying a risky move of his own and Fox sets up a rescue mission that involves surrendering himself to the farmers. The three farmers set up an attack but the collaboration of the animals make a brilliant plan to fend off the humans. Fox, Ash and Kylie the Opossum dip and dive to rescue Kristofferson. With the karate that Ash learned from his more athletic and charming cousin, he uses his new skills to save him. Throughout the movie Fox is witty and fearless but admits to his phobia of wolves. The scene was enjoyable to watch because it proves that Fantastic Fox and the humanly clan of creatures, were all still ""wild animals."" This film really touches on the comedy for children and witty humor for adults. I could definitely see this being a pure adult film where as kids could not appreciate some parts of the film such as the argument between Fox and the Opossum. ""A Titanium Card? Says Mr. Fox: ""How did you qualify for this?"" Kylie says ""I pay my bills on time."" The adult humor makes you think and in my opinion kept me into the movie.",,Anonymous,Animation

Retains The Essence Of The Book,"An exquisitely crafted, gorgeously photographed & splendidly scripted adaptation of Roald Dahl's children novel of the same name, Fantastic Mr. Fox is an enjoyable, entertaining & endlessly exuberant delight for viewers of all ages, and employs its stop-motion animation in ways that only adds to its quirky flavour.Co-written & directed by Wes Anderson (known for The Grand Budapest Hotel & Isle of Dogs), the film retains the essence of the novel despite few modifications in the script and Anderson brings the fantasy world to life with sublime vibrancy & emotional precision. The images are rich & vivid like a finely stitched tapestry.Art direction team makes sure that the set pieces & character designs are in sync with the source of inspiration. The radiant camerawork, warm colour tones & apt lighting further enrich the visuals. Editing leaves out what it can do without, and unfolds the plot at a breezy pace.
