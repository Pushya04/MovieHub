Vintage Spielberg,"I've noticed quite a few reviews here from book fans complaining that the movie wasn't true to the novel. As a fan of the book, let me just say that's true but it's fine. The overarching story is the same. The fact of the matter is with a nearly 400 page novel packed full of pop culture references, some things would have to be cut to make it onto the big screen. Partially it's an issue of length. Partially it's just the reality that the planets were never going to fully align to allow use of many of the properties from the novel. Yes, I loved the 2112, WarGames, D&D, Joust, et al references from the novel as much as the next person, but still I felt that Spielberg captured the wonder and fun and the story of the novel accurately, even if he did so using different references. The are actually some things I even think were an improvement from the book, especially the way they re-imagined I-R0k. The bottom line is, if you're a book reader, just take this movie for what it is, an alternate version of the story, written by the same person who wrote the novel.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great movie but different from the book,Pretty good movie visually and even though the changes from the book are obvious but they don't spoil it. They are changes that have to be made so it translates well on to screen.The comedy in the film is charming and not over the top. It fits in well with the film.The visuals are awesome. There are so many Easter eggs and references from pop culture it's unbelievable that they managed to add so many. It'll take a long time to spot them all.Overall I'd say this film is definitely worth a watch.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Welcome back Spielberg,"Spielberg remains to this day one of the most misunderstood film-makers of his generation. He has been labeled both a peddler of popcorn and a saccharine manipulator (Those who say the latter have clearly forgotten Alex Kitner erupting in a geyser of blood in Jaws, exploding Nazi heads, the horrors of the Holocaust in Schindler and the river of corpses in War of the Worlds).There are two Spielbergs. 
There's the man who makes somber, academy award winning dramas (Empire of the Sun, Saving Private Ryan, Munich, War Horse, Lincoln etc). Then's there's the 10 year old playing in the sand box (The Indy films, Hook, Jurassic Park, Tintin etc). What I enjoy most about the 'Berg, is how he can zigzag between disparate genres. 
But after a stretch of SF films (A.I, Minority Report and War of the Worlds), I was looking forward to a return to the free wheeling fun with Crystal Skull. It turned out to be an uncharacteristic dud that despite the boffo box office, proved to be deeply unpopular with fans of the series.This made me cautious about Ready Player One. Had Spielberg lost his touch? 
I was wrong. This may be one of the most visually amazing and effortlessly fun films I've seen in a long time. I have not read Ernest Cline's novel, so fans of the popular novel may have issues, but I rarely read the books before seeing the film.The cast are great. Tye Sheridan are Olivia Cooke are the standouts. Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg are fun in supporting roles. Alan Silvestri's robust score is one of his most memorable. I miss John Williams, but it's still a great score. Longtime 'Berg collaborator Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is beautiful. And it's the only film where you'll see a DeLorean chasing a T-Rex on the big screen. That image alone is worth the ticket price. 
 
He never went away, but it's nice to see him back playing in the sand box.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Near future, virtual reality rules.","My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library and found it thoroughly enjoyable, even though we are grandparents and far removed from the virtual reality, gaming crowd.This is a Spielberg movie, and even though this story is unique it has many of the movie-making elements he used in such movies as ""E.T."", ""Raiders"", ""Jurassic Park"", ""A.I."" and more recently ""The BFG"". Imaginative cinematography, interesting action, and a really killer of a sound track. That alone makes it a worthwhile viewing.There is also a good story going on. It is Columbus, Ohio in 2045, it is somewhat dystopian and many have turned to a virtual reality existence in something called Oasis. It is a form of escape, it allows one to avoid dealing with real world issues.Upon the death of the creator and owner of Oasis it is announced that the winner of a contest, finding obscure clues in Oasis, would be given Oasis and complete control of it. So the story becomes a contest between a few dedicated gamers and a big corporation using its resources to win the contest.The key gamer is Texas native Tye Sheridan as 18-yr-old Wade, who in virtual reality goes by Parzival. He is helped by British actress Olivia Cooke as Samantha who goes by Art3mis. His intention are honorable, he realizes that people need to get back to reality, to connect with each other rather than gravitate towards virtual reality.The movie is really well made, and even though it is long at 2+ hours it never wore out its welcome.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ready Player One: Considerably better than I expected,"There seem to be two camps as far as Ready Player One is concerned, those who have read the books (Who tend to dislike the movie) and those who haven't (Who tend to like the movie). I'm in the latter group and am very thankful for this.When the trailer came out I was unimpressed and didn't get onboard with the hype at all, yes I was impressed with all the pop culture references and characters but I figured it would be all flash and no substance.Thankfully I couldn't have been anymore wrong, Read Player One has plenty of substance, emotion and charm and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.Set in a near dystopian world where people use a virtual reality world called the Oasis to escape their lives it tells the story of one player and his efforts participating in a competition that with decide the fate of the entire universe (Oasis).The plot if fantastic and very well handled, the movie looks like a billion dollars, the cast did a decent enough job and the pop culture references though thick and fast didn't overwhelm the movie like I feared they would.From Overwatchs Tracer, Streetfighters Chun-Li & Ryu, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Iron Giant, Chucky, Freddy Kreuger, Mortal Kombats Goro, Gundam, Mech-Godzilla, King Kong, and countless more I being a big ol'nerd really appreciated this. Combined with the incredible mostly 80's soundtrack it's a sight to behold.The movie wrapped up nicely and went in directions I didn't expect, I'm suitably impressed and would love to see more.If it's very different than the book I understand peoples anger, for me however this was fantastic.The Good:Looks amazingSolid plot and deliveryPop culture references are charmingThe Bad:Honestly nothing springs to mindThings I Learnt From This Movie:I'm still not impressed with GundamPeople CAN swear in Spielberg moviesOld Simon Pegg looks like a tall hobbitArtemis is the offspring of an elf and a porcupine",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Instant Classic,"I honestly didn't think that Spielberg had another crowd-pleasing actioner left in him. For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?This film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the ""real"" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.I have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out ""form of a gundam"" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky (""Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky"" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).But to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.The characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare.And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to
write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Ready, set, go in the oasis","Watched 'Ready Player One' as someone who got a lot of pleasure out of the book and who loves a lot of Steven Spielberg's previous work. Despite it getting a fair share of criticism from fans of the book, that there were also enough good things said about it from critics and that many of my friends said it was worthwhile persuaded me enough to see it.'Ready Player One' left me with a mixed view (or just slightly above). As a book adaptation 'Ready Player One' is severely wanting, having lost what made the book so special. As a film on its own, which is how it will be judged by me being a much fairer way to judge, 'Ready Player One' is quite decent though with faults. It is nowhere near being one of Spielberg's best, a distinction he has not hit for a while (though for me he has not sold out), at the same time it is not one of his misfires either. To me 'Ready Player One' is a middling effort.Starting with its good merits, 'Ready Player One' looks incredible. One of those films where one is truly immersed in a world filled with a non-stop sense of wonder. The Oasis depiction is rich in wonder, adventure, vibrancy and imagination, the cool factor is also high. The special effects are pretty spectacular. Alan Silvestri provides the best score in a Spielberg film since 'War Horse' (and one of the best in the past fifteen years or so), providing a lot of energy and thrills.Nostalgia is rife with inspired cameos of numerous significant cultural characters, like the 'Jurassic Park' dinosaur and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and even more numerous cultural references, highlights being the 'Back to the Future' Delorean and the Overlook Hotel from 'The Shining'. There is enough wit and intrigue in the writing and the story has many instances where it is fun and laden in thrills, the chase scenes especially. Particularly standing out is the one switching between real world and the Oasis. Spielberg delivers on the spectacle, the world building and the visual style.Although not complex or subtle, the characters are engaging enough. Olivia Cooke is very appealing and shares charming chemistry with Tye Sheridan. Simon Pegg is great fun, while Ben Mendelssohn has a whale of a time as the villain and Mark Rylance beautifully and terrifically provides the emotion and soul that is not quite there elsewhere.However, the story does tend to be lacking. There is just too little structurally in a very long, too long even, running time, no matter how many cultural references there are. With trying to take on a lot, character depth and development are sacrificed in favour of spectacle and nostalgia. Luckily those are done well, but one does wish that the characters were more interesting with the lead character in particular not having much growth.This does affect somewhat Tye Sheridan's performance, shining in the chemistry with Cooke but elsewhere it's somewhat bland and cold. The script does have wit and intrigue but it can also be exposition heavy, and it is here where the writing feels rambling, unnatural and clumsy. There are aspects of Spielberg's directing that comes over well.Unfortunately, what doesn't is the complete command of the material and giving the film enough soul and emotion (Rylance cannot bring those qualities out all on his own, no matter how well he did them). Some of the messaging is heavy-handed and the finale is far too overly-sentimental and where the sketchiness of the character development and overall depth is most betrayed.Overall, diverting and entertaining enough but was expecting more. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Sorry nerds, this is for the rest of us.","Its hard for me to believe all of the one and two star reviews for this film on here from people who are obsessed with the book. In fact, I even heard similar comments from people in the theater after the movie ended. One girl was actually complaining that she disliked it for the same reason she can't watch Game of Thrones, because it's not faithful to the source material.Well I'm sorry that your trip out of your parent's basement wasn't as satisfying as you hoped, but for the rest of us who haven't read the book and are not obsessive video game or pop culture fans it was a great movie. There's enough references for everyone to enjoy the story, but not enough to confuse the majority of the audience.The visual effects are stunning and while the story may be wrapped up a little too neatly, its still a stunning tour de force from the best director in the business.This was a great film with an excellent warning about the overuse video games and virtual reality. Definitely one to see and if you want more, than go read the book.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The book might be better, but the references work better on screen","Ernest Cline's fast-moving novel was a treasure trove for pop-culture junkies, but the endless references work better on the screen.The year is 2045; the place is Columbus, Ohio. Our hero, Wade Watts, fills in the details while climbing past his grungy homes of his town, ""the stacks,"" where trailer parks are piled on top of each other sky-high. Things are so miserable in Wade's world, everyone escapes to play in an immersive virtual reality game known as the Oasis. Its founder, James Halliday is worshipped like a god until his death some years before. However, before he left the mortal world, the creator left behind a series of games that would reward the winner with the prize of the keys to his virtual kingdom.The book was a fast paced adventure that took its time to geek out on all of the 80's pop culture references but the film doesn't do that. . Spielberg doesn't have Wade (the titular character) talk audiences through it, and he doesn't spell out the references, he just quickly stamps down the Delorean in the middle of a action sequence and then continues onward. Fans can pause it frame by frame and analyse it thoroughly looking for the flux capacitor on the dashboard, checking the plates, and scanning for extra bonus material. Even to people who've never seen the Back to the Future movies and aren't vibing on the connection, the car doesn't need explaining. It's just a sleek piece of visual energy, one breathless element among dozens of others. That's why the movie works better than the books in terms of visual style and nostalgia.The thin plot and the not so well done shallow characters make the film to be just a pop culture reference filled visual treat. Several plot holes( If movement is required to move an avatar in the game, how do people play in the Oasis while standing in their living rooms?) and a non-existent character arc makes it a fun, but a tangible watch. They're all already heroes, the big bad is evil from start to finish.The story's breakneck speed, it's never ending references, make it a fun, exciting watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Virtually brilliant with Easter Eggs a plenty.,"Of all the Spielberg films of recent years - and possibly with the exception of ""The BFG"" - this was the film whose trailer disconcerted me the most. It really looked dire: CGI over heart; gimmicks over substance. I was right about 'The BFG"", one of my least favourite Spielberg flicks. I was definitely wrong about ""Ready Player One"": it's a blast.The film is fun in continually throwing surprises at you, including those actors not included in the trailer and only on small print on the poster. So I won't spoil that here for you (you can of course look them up on imdb if you want to: but I suggest you try to see this one 'cold').It's 2044, and the majority of the population have taken the next logical step of video gaming and virtual reality and retreated into their own headsets, living out their lives primarily as avatars within the fanciful landscapes of ""The Oasis"". You can ""be"" anyone and (subject to gaining the necessary credits) ""do"" anything there.The Oasis was the brainchild of a (Steve Wozniak-like) genius called James Halliday (played in enormous style by ""Actor R"") and supported by his (Steve Jobs-like) business partner Ogden Morrow (""Actor P""). The two had a big falling out leaving Halliday in total control of the Oasis. But he died, and his dying ""game"" was to devise a devious competition that left a trail of three virtual keys in the Oasis leading to an 'easter egg': which if found would provide the finder with total ownership of the Oasis and the trillions of dollars that it is worth.But the game is not only played by amateur ""gunters"" (egg-hunters) like our hero Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan, ""X-Men: Apocalypse"") and his in-Oasis flirting partner Samantha (Olivia Cooke, ""Me and Earl and the Dying Girl""); there are big corporate game-hunters involved like IoI (that's eye-oh-eye, not one-oh-one as I assumed from the trailer) who fill warehouses with combinations of nerd-consultants and professional game players to try to find the keys before anyone else. Which hardly seems fair does it? Ruthless boss Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn, ""Rogue One"") and his tough-as-nails hench-woman F'Nale Zandor (Hannah John-Kamen, ""Tomb Raider"") really couldn't give a toss!What follows is two-hours of high-octane game-play and eye-popping 3D (it is good in 3D by the way) that melds a baseline of ""Avatar"" with soupçons of ""Tron"", ""Minority Report"" and Dan Brown novels. But its a blend that works.I was afraid as I said that CGI would squash flat any hope of character development and story, and - yes - to be sure this is 'suppressed' a bit. You never get to really know many of the 'pack' members to any great level other than Wade and Samantha. And exactly what drives the corporate protagonists, other than ""corporate greed"", is not particularly clear. What gives the film heart though are the performances of ""Actor P"" and (particularly) ""Actor R"", who again steals every scene he is in. For their limited screen time together, the pair bounce off each other in a delightful way.I have to make a confession at this point that I spent the whole film thinking ""Miles Teller is way too old for the part of Wade""! Tye Sheridan (who I think *does* bear a likeness!) is actually much more age appropriate, and is fine in the role. But the star performance for me, out of the youngsters at least, was Oldham's-own Olivia Cooke, who has a genuinely magnetic screen presence. She is most definitely a name to watch for the future.Almost unrecognizable in the role is the woman of the hour Letitia Wright (""Black Panther"", ""Thor: Ragnarok"") as Wade's inventor friend Reb.The story, although simple and quite one-dimensional, in the main intrigues: there is nothing like a Mario-style chase for keys to entertain when it is done well (I am so old and crusty that in my day it was ""Manic Miner"" on a ZX-Spectrum!).And there's not just one ""Easter Egg"" in this film: the film is rammed to the rafters with throwbacks to classic pop-culture icons of past decades, and particularly the 80's.... the film could have been subtitled ""I Heart 80's"". Some of these are subliminal (Mayor Goldie Wilson anyone?), and others are more prominent but very clever: ""The Zemekis cube"" and ""The Holy Hand Grenade"" being prime examples. This is a film that deserves buying on Blu-ray and then slo-mo-ing through! The nostalgia extends to the music by Alan Silvestri, with occasional motifs from his most famous soundtrack!For me though, the highspot of the film though is a journey into a recreation of a classic '80's film which - while a scary sequence, earning for sure its 12A UK rating - is done with verve and chutzpah.Although a little overlong (2 hours 20 mins) and getting rather over-blown and LOTR-esque in the finale, the ending is very satisfying - roll on Tuesdays and Thursdays!Spielberg's recent films have been largely solid and well-constructed watches (""The Post"" and ""Bridge of Spies"" for example) but they have been more niche than mainstream box office draws. I firmly predict that ""Ready Player One"" will change that: here Spielberg has a sure-fire hit on his hands and word of mouth (rather than the ho-hum trailer) should assure that.(For the graphical review, please visit bob-the-movie-man.com or One Mann's Movies on Facebook.

A feast the eyes and a story straight out of the Spielberg playbook,"Keys hidden in a VR game world unlock the fortune of the inventor of the OASIS and control over it, so a group of kids must stop a shady Corporation getting the prize.Like ET crossed with Willy Wonka, Ready Player One is Spielberg back to classic Spielberg - the kids are fighting off the big bad business boss while trying to win the grand prize of a tech giant's fortune and control of the OASIS, a virtual reality world used by most of the planet's population to escape the horrors of their everyday lives. The tech giant in question is the socially awkward but big dreaming James Halliday expertly played by Mark Rylance in a Brian May wig (originally Spielberg wanted Gene Wilder to play the role before his untimely death in 2016) who lived pop culture references and so made all the challenges (all different to the ones in the 2011 book by Ernest Cline) based around his obsession with 1970s & 80s pop culture.Characters including the Iron Giant, Harley Quinn, MechaGozilla, Chucky, Lara Croft and King Kong all make an appearance alongside references from games like Overwatch, Pitfall, Mortal Kombat, Joust, Street Fighter II, Bioshock, Battle Toads and Mass Effect and more than enough film nods like Back to the Future, Alien, Saturday Night Fever, Robocop, Monty Python & the Holy Grail, Jurassic Park, Beetlejuice, Terminator 2, Mad Max and Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. The amazing thing is that the constant search for these on-screen glimpses doesn't distract at all from the story and, in typical Spielberg fashion, the action and narrative are married perfectly with one never overshadowing the other.There are a vast number of audience-made lists out there on forums documenting as many references as they can and there always seems to be one they've missed. It never ends. From the big ones (like an entire sequence set in a particular film which was completely missing from the trailer, so you'll get no spoilers here) to the little ones (like a briefly-mentioned artefact that turns time back by 60 seconds called the Zemeckis Cube, so named after the Back to the Future director), they flash by for you to either catch and enjoy or miss and never know that that was Freddy Krueger being punched in the balls by Duke Nukem.Best Quote: ""I mean ... it's nothing less than a war for control of the future.""",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An Entertaining VR Movie that Ignores Real-World Problems,"If you are just looking for a fun movie with expertly directed action sequences, wow moments, and beautiful effects, this is the movie for you. If you are the type of person who cannot help but analyze every movie you see, Ready Player One will cause you some problems.Spielberg is a master of wow moments. He knows how to capture characters in moments of awe, and he knows how to make the audiences respond with dropped jaws and bewildered expressions. That's why the guy is one of the most financially successful filmmakers of all time. Watching this particular film of his makes it easy to see, even if you weren't already aware of his reputation, that Spielberg works the camera like few others can.That said, this movie is not perfect.The premise, at least on its surface, seems wonderful. A teenage boy (Tye Sheridan), named Wade Watts (because it sounds like a superhero's alter ego) in the near future plays an ultra-version of a virtual reality game to escape his grim real-world existence. Everyone in his world does. And we can see why. The VR world (The Oasis) is awesome.Wade spends his time obsessing over a contest in The Oasis left behind by its now deceased creator. The winner of the contest claims a kajillion dollars (or something like that) and control over The Oasis. With a prize like that, Wade is obviously not the only person trying to win.So, one day he meets a girl who uses the player name Art3mis (a charming Olivia Cooke) and joins her group. Together they try to win the contest before the evil company does and puts ads in The Oasis (which doesn't seem that bad). Then blah, blah, blah. You can imagine how this all turns out. If not, great, you'll be surprised.This all seems fine and fun until you dissect the movie even a little bit. The message the movie sends is that this is all about friendship, which is total BS. Friendship is important, sure, but in this world, there is more at stake. Wade and much of the country live in terrible poverty, and a couple mega-businesses control the state of everything. It's a miserable reality with problems that we see today, except amplified by 100.It's irresponsible and insulting that the movie pretends that this future world will be okay as long as The Oasis doesn't have ads. People still live in poverty. The world is still in shambles.What I'm saying is, the movie has a problem with stakes. The stakes of this future world are enormous and dire, but the movie chooses to ignore them. That doesn't sit right with me.One other issue, and this one is minor, is that this movie seems like it's made for kids, but it makes a bunch of 80s nostalgia references. Does that make sense? I don't think today's 14-year-olds care about Duran-Duran.Even looking past the social blinders this movie chooses to wear and the confusing nostalgia choices, the third act drags horribly. I spaced out for a good ten minutes and didn't miss a thing.In spite of all that, this movie has moments of ecstasy. If you are going to see, and I'm not sure if you should, see it in a theater. If you can avoid analyzing the movie and simply enjoy it from a pure entertainment standpoint, you may love it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Virtual Virtuosity,"""Ready Player One"" was first a sci-fi novel written by Ernest Cline, published in 2011. Warner Bros. saw so much potential in this novel, they bought the rights for its film version a full year before it was even published. Cline adapted his own book into a script, with the assistance of veteran screenwriter Zak Penn. With Steven Spielberg signing on to direct in 2015, this film had all the ingredients for a blockbuster film.It is 2045. Wade Watt was an orphaned young man who lived in the ""Stacks,"" a dystopian slum neighborhood in Columbus, Ohio. Like everyone else at that time, Wade spent his days going inside the OASIS, a virtual world where people can do anything they desire. As his avatar Parzival, Wade wanted to win the game challenge left by the late OASIS inventor James Halliday -- where anyone who can win three keys leading to an Easter Egg hidden somewhere in the OASIS will inherit full ownership of the Halliday's invention.I first saw lead actor Tye Sheridan in 2015 in two thematically diverse films like ""Scout's Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse"" (MY REVIEW) and ""Dark Places"" (MY REVIEW). He then made a strong impression as the young Cyclops in ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" (2016). His role here as Wade Watts is bound to launch this young 21-year old actor into super-stardom. Although half of the time, we see him as his avatar Parzival, Sheridan ably carried the whole film on his shoulders in both the action and drama components of his role.His group of friends in the OASIS were a diverse bunch of very skilled video game geeks. Lena Waithe played Helen Harris, whose OASIS identity Aech was a musclebound male techie and Wade's best friend. Win Morisaki and Philip Zhao play Japanese gamers Toshiro and Akihide whose avatars were samurai Daito and ninja Shoto respectively. Olivia Cooke played Samantha Cook, a rebel activist in real life and Wade's cyber crush Art3mis virtually. Although the book does not have a follow-up, it does not seem impossible if we see this group again in a future sequel for further adventures of The High Five.Mark Rylance was not easily recognized in his unkempt long-haired geek make-up as the eccentric James Halliday, the timid genius who developed a virtual world to escape the loneliness of the real world. Simon Pegg played Halliday's only friend and business partner Ogden Morrow, who later became estranged due to their divergent philosophies.Veteran character actor Ben Mendehlson played the main antagonist character Nolan Sorrento, CEO of the Innovative Online Industries or IOI, manufacturers of virtual reality hardware. He hired an entire army of virtual warriors in order to win Halliday's Easter Egg in order for IOI to gain control of the whole OASIS. There was so much subtle tongue-in-cheek humor in his portrayal of a ruthless character. T.J. Miller stole scenes as virtual mercenary i-R0k whom Sorrento hired to do his virtual mayhem.This film was so much fun to watch with all the pop culture references that abound in it. You'd need repeated watching of this film to catch all those little juicy details hidden in the scenes and the dialogue. You will see King Kong, Mecha-Godzilla, Gundam, the Iron Giant in all their glory, and catch glimpses of the Batmobile, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tony Manero's disco moves and many more.The musical soundtrack was steeped in 1980s pop songs, beginning with Van Halen's ""Jump"" from the opening scene, and citations of a-ha and Duran Duran. There were rich references to 1980s movies with mentions of names like John Hughes, Ferris Bueller and Buckaroo Banzai. Parzival's car is a DeLorean from ""Back to the Future."" There was entire elaborate segment dedicated to a tribute to the horror classic ""The Shining"" (Stanley Kubrick, 1980), in what is probably the most fun part of the whole film.Watching a film like this in 3D IMAX is very much worth the additional ticket expense. The computer-generated world of OASIS really came alive three-dimensionally for the audience as they are drawn in and immersed into what is practically what the characters were virtually seeing and experiencing in their heads.From the 1970s all the way to the 1990s, Steven Spielberg had given us some of the most engaging adventure films of all time both by young film fans and old -- ""Jaws"" (1974), ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" (1977), ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981), ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" (1982), ""Jurassic Park"" (1993). It is only now that Spielberg had again handled material that showed that he still had that magic touch when it comes to directing these types of films, making them connect with audiences of all generations. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Quite worth watching...,"I had very little expectations for this movie, especially since the ones I know who watched it said that it wasn't all that spectacular. Well, I got the chance to sit down and watch ""Ready Player One"", had the time to spare, so why not?I must say that I was surprised with the result of this movie, because it was actually rather entertaining. Sure, it had a predictable and generic storyline, but it was still entertaining enough for what it was.What really blew me away was the special effects and CGI. This was definitely spectacular, and there were so many details. I love the overwhelming amount of familiar characters that there were to be seen throughout the entire movie. There were so many pop culture characters and obscure characters that only true nerds of movies, gaming, comics, etc. would recognize. It was especially awesome to see Jason Voorhees and Spawn make appearances as avatars in the movie as well.There was a good flow to the movie and it kept its upbeat pace all the way to the very end, and that made for some entertaining stuff.I will say that the movie is worth watching again, not for the story or the special effects, but for picking out familiar characters used as Oasis avatars in the movie, that would be quite a task.All in all, ""Ready Player One"" is definitely worth taking the time to sit down and watch. And it had a lovely morale as well, and that being that people need to live their lives in the real life and not in an online illusion of a world.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Relies heavily on empty nostalgia and pop-culture references but lacks engagement and a solid story of its own.,"'Ready Player One (2018)' should have been called 'The Pop-Culture Movie', since it is so chock-full of blatant references and call-backs to media, from the eighties and nineties in particular. It seems as though this over-reliance on pre-existing material, along with its recognition and nostalgic value, is the driving force behind most of the narrative, being that the flick itself doesn't capture the spirit of the films it intends to ape, and so often calls out by name to cringe-worthy results, but instead shoves in reference after soulless reference in a vapid attempt to prey on its audience's ability to recognise things they've seen before. This 'nostalgia vampirism' is meant to evoke memories of better films and have those emotions transposed onto this one, though it only succeeds in the former and reminds you how much you'd rather watch any of those than this. It's evocative of the larger issues that plague the flick, those being that it doesn't have any real stakes or ability to engage on its own and also treats its audience as rather dumb and forces expository dialogue down their throats at every opportunity. The on-the-nose exposition is honesty some of the most intense and grating I've experienced in some time. The feature does have some nice visual effects and I care about the digital 'avatars' as much as any of their real-world counter-parts, though only to a certain degree, but so much is happening that it it's hard to register at times due to the odd colour palette and heavily contrasting character designs. It doesn't have a cohesive aesthetic, to say the least. It does have a good score by Alan Silvestri, though, and some of its allegorical undertones certainly ring true. It honestly doesn't entertain me, though, despite all its visual splendour and things that should appeal directly to me, and that really tells you all you need to know. For all the throw-away movie references, where is the fun of 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)'? Where is the wonder of 'E. T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982)', the suspense of 'Jaws (1975)' or the excitement of 'Jurassic Park (1993)'? In other words, where is Spielberg? 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Absolutely Fantastic,"Geeks rejoice. Spielberg is back to form!! I was privileged to see Ready Player One last night and I still can't stop smiling about it. It's very strange to feel this energised after a film and I've not felt like this since Avatar. I can honestly say with hand on heart that for me, that was the best cinematic experience I've had in years. Oh my God, it's a wonderful piece of filmmaking. Not only are there so many references to geek culture including films and TV shows we all love and hold dear but the overall story, pacing, character development, FX and score are simply perfect. Spielberg is in total command here and flexing his muscles. There's many imitators to his throne (remain nameless) but no one can touch him when he's doing what he does best. There's not one single scene in RP1 that felt flat or shouldn't be there and everything flows so perfectly the 2 hrs and 40 mins flies by. I'm still smiling over one scene that made me lose my mind. Lol.

Best Video Game Movie Of All Time!! Thank You Steven Spielberg!!,"NO SPOILERS - I promise.BEST VIDEO GAME THEMED FILM OF ALL TIME &
AN INSTANT CLASSIC FOREVERLet me first off state that I have not read the book prior to seeing this film.However, I enjoined the film sooo much that I am now interested in buying the book so that I can see the difference between it and the film adaption.This movie is full of nostalgia! You feel like Marty Mcfly in Back to the Future - going back in time, only in this case - a journey filled with absolute nostalgia of pop culture from the 80s and possible some early 90s.The entire time you can spot references or so called easter eggs throughout the entire film. You get that feeling of being a kid again and reliving your childhood (if you grew up in those times) on a roller coaster ride! The nostalgia is not just other things you see throughout the film but also from some of the lines the characters in the story use, their gestures, and even clothing apparel! Not to mention, the music!!! What a great choice and what better than using Van Halen's ""Jump"" in the trailer to let you know you're about to step back into 80s!The film displays beautiful vivid colors of non stop special effects and the action is very consistent without long dwelling scenes of nonsense found in other films. You feel like you're enjoying an absolute retro filled vibe through the movie yet it doesn't feel outdated at all - it feels modern and current with the times! It's like Tron meets Wreck it Ralph w/ a small touch of maybe say The Wizard!The film was an awesome refresher to all the recent most disappointing films in Hollywood, and that old school still has a great touch of simplicity but also powerful creativity that many film makers could learn from today, a message to film makers today - when you over complicate films or stories you tend to lose a lot of quality in the fun factor. The film is NOT overly cheesy and doesn't make you cringe or soo bad its good in examples of other films like ""The Wizard"", ""Super Mario Bros"", ""Street Fighter"", ""Dead or Alive"", ""Pixels"" or ""Double Dragon"" etc. No, this film got it right!The only thing I will say is that it did feel like they could have elaborated on some essential things that are missing from the book that people have mentioned but hey, the film is only roughly 2 hours, its not enough time to cram all of that. I could name hundreds of other films that have come out recently over the last couple years - including this year, that are absolutely terrible with plot holes, long dragging needless scenes and didn't make the best usage of a film's time.But this movie: READY PLAYER ONE did a great job in managing its time among scenes because they spent more time on the things that people wanted to see!!Not to mention, the film has a great message that its trying to get across and that is explained at the end.I enjoined the movie soo much that after seeing it the first time at a standard showing, I decided to watch it a second time in I-max! Yes it was worth paying more to see it again on the big screen!! I took my gf and she loved every bit of the film!Hope you guys found this review to be helpful!GO SEE IT!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
'Ready Player One' Review: High score for Spielberg,"""Ready Player One"" brings back the fun Steven Spielberg with an old-fashioned, effects-laden adventure where the world is often more important than its characters. Still, this world is guaranteed to entertain fans of nostalgia both young and old, even if the older crowd will find the basic plot formulaic and predictable.The film is sort of like how ""Tron"" was back in 1982 if you replaced the made-up characters and environments with those of actual pop cultural icons. The future setting of the film is so displeasing that the majority of the population has chosen to enjoy their time inside the OASIS, a virtual reality video game where you can basically do anything or be anything. The socially awkward creator of this game James Halliday, now deceased, has left a three-step challenge that if completed, will grant the victor access to control the OASIS. The story follows Wade Watts and his friends on a quest to complete the challenge before an evil corporation that is bent on seizing control of the OASIS through the completion of the challenges and turning it into what would essentially be a pop-up ad heaven (or hell, depending on your perspective).""Ready Player One"" is a great visual experience first and foremost. The use of nostalgia feels more as a means to be realistic rather than a means to capitalize on one's childhood. There are plenty of moments that are just there to be pointed out as Easter eggs, but it never distracts from the core story. The adventure inside the OASIS is fun and immersive in the classic Spielberg sense with the balance of seriousness and humor being on point. The film also does manage to throw in good messages and satire about society being obsessed with trying to escape the real world, often at the consequence of losing touch with the things of true value in the real world. The best example of this is the idea of teenagers developing a ""relationship"" online despite never seeing each other face to face. As one character quotes, ""You only see and hear what I want you to."" The message is also pushed via Halliday who chose to devote so much time to his own pop culture safe space, that he lost a close friend and a chance for love in the process. So in a sense, pop culture does serve an actual purpose. Still, purpose or not, it is very gitty to see so much on screen at once. I particularly jumped onto the fanboy train once the heroes entered the second stage of the challenge, which involves navigating a certain popular horror film which I shall not reveal.This is definitely a film for kids, who will likely walk away with this ironically becoming a nostalgic part of their own childhoods. Adults will also have a lot of fun, but as an adult, I can't help but notice some things. For one, there really isn't much to the core plot. Outside the OASIS, things are pretty basic. The human characters are mostly just base level and, oddly enough, are overshadowed by the colorful avatar counterparts. The plot of an evil corporation, an underground resistance, and the inevitable revolution of little people vs elites has been done time and time before and sadly the film does nothing to mix up that narrative. The story goes pretty much where you expect outside of the visual package that is unique to ""Ready Player One's"" style. The characters aren't bad and all the actors are great, but only two really walk away with memorable depth: Watts's love interest Art3mis and OASIS creator James Halliday. Also, the exposition was very heavy at the beginning of the film. While some was necessary, there did come a point where I felt the voiceover narration from Watts was going overboard.Most of this is just nitpicking as none of that ruins the overall fun factor of the picture. The world of the OASIS is worth price of admission and some good, timely messages do manage to speak through without feeling preachy or political. The fact that the nostalgia feels like it has an artistic purpose really impressed me, but I can't deny I will likely indulge into more viewings just to find all the pop culture Easter eggs I likely missed...for fanboy satisfaction.Recommended.

Game mountain,"Which is what ""Spiel Berg"" means translated from German into English. I guess there is a joke in there concerning the movie too. But back to this one and a first confession: I have not read the book, so my review but more importantly my rating are ""free"" from any knowledge or background of that. Of course I am aware of many of the references in the movie, being a gamer myself, but also a massive fan of movies.Even so, I could not spot all of them and I'm pretty sure many out there have the same ""problem"". So if you want all of them, you probably have to watch the movie again. It might not fit in well with some of the story elements (very cliche), but it will help to keep an eye out for the references. Although for some you may want to google and find out when they come up (blink and you'll miss them).The movie itself is well made, but you knew that with Spielberg on the helm.

So close to being something special but so Disnified that it never gets there.,"The concept is very interesting. A number of potential elements of future society are introduced, but never really explored. That is sad, so much could have been done to explore those plot lines.The special effects are first class and top of the line.The villain is very weak and his motivation is rather implausible, the villain is so tired and cartoonish that it takes a great deal away from the movie. It's too 2 dimensional to even root against the villain. The romance aspect strait out of a Disney animated movie. So that's a wash as well.The action mostly takes place in in the virtual world but real world/virtual world, it's well done and compelling.The acting is solid, though no actor could mumble some of the lines without needing a shot of something after as they are so corny. Lifted almost directly from Disney flicks.So this is a great movie for a 10 year old. Could have been a landmark movie for everyone if it hadn't been formalized, Disneyfied and bottled for commercial consumption. Ironically personifying the villain in the way such a great script idea and the spectacular efforts of the special effects team were so mutilated.

"Some of Spielberg's Best in Years,","Ready Player One is a terrific film with a very well written plot and an immensely talented cast. The film is truly like no other, establishing a very beautiful and unique spectacle from the get go, creating a virtual reality world that we get so entranced in that we often forget its fictional. The animation is truly beautiful and believable, the many references to pop culture were very entertaining, and the film's overall message is immensely heartwarming.One thing I will say about this film that dropped from a potential nine to an eight for me was a major lack of character development. No one, even Wade, are given enough scope for us to truly care and be concerned for their well being. While I was in a complete trance at all the action sequences, that was more so because of how beautiful it looked rather than supporting the characters.While they may be underdeveloped, the cast all still make a terrific show of their characters. Tye Sheridan is very effective as the lead, Olivia Cooke is a great love interest, Ben Mendelsohn steals every scene as a cliched video game villain, Lena Waithe is a hilarious best friend, Simon Pegg is completely transformed in to this role that is greatly different from who he is, and Mark Rylance annihilates as Halliday, a role he really immerses himself in to.Immense fun from beginning to end. Action packed and heartwarming, Ready Player One is a solid adventure that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good Sci-Fi or family film.A group of hardcore gamers search for clues to unlock the creator of their virtual reality world's fortune.Best Performance: Mark Rylance",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Spielberg Adventure Film,"As a lover of Spielberg, I had high expectations for this film, and to be honest, I was not let down. Ready Player One tells a simple yet captivating story filled with interesting puzzles, pop culture references, and great action sequences. I enjoyed how the story felt like an adventure that had components similar to a quest in a video game such as collecting items, solving puzzles, and overcoming obstacles. I think this was a smart choice since it made the notion that the Oasis was a video game much more believable. I also really enjoyed the action sequences in this film. I am not the biggest fan of action movies, but I thought this film shot the scenes tastefully. The racing scene and the large battle near the end of the film were two of the action scenes that really stood out to me. There were not a whole lot of quick cuts and blurry visual effects, proving that Spielberg and his team put time and effort into those scenes.Many people seem to have complaints about the film's use of pop culture references, some even calling it ""Super Smash Bros: The Movie."" I would disagree with many of these criticisms. I felt as though most of the references did not distract or take away from the film. Sure, there were moments of, ""Oh look there is..."" but overall, I did not think that I was constantly being taken out of the experience. I also think that it is realistic that everyone in the Oasis is some sort of licensed avatar. Look at games like VR Chat today, all the people running around in that game are using a licensed avatar. In my opinion, I enjoyed the references (minus the terrible line about Twitch streams) and thought it was a unique experience seeing all of the pop culture icons on screen at the same time.Even though I enjoyed the film, there were some definite issues I had with it. The first issue I had, which seems to be a popular criticism, was that the characters did not have a ton of depth. You got some brief backstory on some of the characters, but mostly the motivations for the actions were brushed over rather quickly. There were many times I craved for backstory or relationships to be more developed such as the relationship between Wade and his aunt, what happened to Wade's parents, and a few other plot points. Another issue that I had with the film was that the initial 15 minutes felt very expositional. I understand that the film had a lot to explain to setup the story, but I think it could have done a better job in the beginning of showing instead of telling through narrative exposition.
Ready Player One had some issues, but overall, I think it was an enjoyable film. The quest-like plot structure along with some interesting surprises made the film a captivating and fun experience. I would recommend this film to people who enjoy action adventure films, video games, and/or science fiction.The Good:Fun adventure storySome interesting surprisesGreat visual effectsExecution of action sequencesThe Bad:The shallow depth of most charactersA great deal of expositional dialog initiallyMentioning Twitch...",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not Spielberg's best, but still decent","READY PLAYER ONE is the latest installment in visionary Steven Spielberg's ever-growing collection of stories. While not his best work, it is still worth at least one watch.The movie itself is not terrible. For crying out loud, it's Spielberg we're talking about! He only makes good films and not-so-good films. That being said, this particular film had a balance of good elements and not-so-good elements. One of its weakest elements was that it did not offer enough surprises. This is especially odd because that has been Spielberg's job for more than 40 years. The good news is: it's not his fault. Rather, it was the writing that was more at fault.Before getting into how basic the overall writing was, it is fair to say that the storyline was somewhat passable. Taking on a similar tale to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, this story follows a worldwide competition to win ownership of the entire virtual reality world. One of the problems, however, was that it was only the VR world that seemed to be at stake. There was almost no connection to the circumstances of the real world, causing a lack of emotional depth to the story and making it difficult for the audience to relate to the conflict. Another problem was a lack of explanation as to how the world became such a desolate wasteland by the year 2045. This is a plot point that is barely explained in the beginning and should have been expanded more or somehow tied into the conflict that occurs in the video game.On top of this, the screenplay consisted of far too much expository dialogue relating to the cultural references that appear every so often. It may be a good method for avoiding any confusion from any one without knowledge of video games, but does the audience really need a history lesson every ten minutes?Keep in mind, this is all coming from someone who has never read the book. And it's certain there is a reason for the story being told the way it was. However, just as a wild thought, what would have worked better is if the story revolved around adult players and if it was more humorous without becoming raunchy. This would allow the adult video game community to relate to this film even more, since they already seem to enjoy the 80's references.The cast in this film is a mixed variety in terms of talent. Some of the great performances came from Olivia Cooke, Simon Pegg (as always), Mark Rylance, and Ben Mendelsohn; all actors who held such presence in the moment and breathed life into the motives of their characters. One of the actors who lacked those qualities was Tye Sheridan, who played the main protagonist. Unfortunately, he seemed to only pretended to take his role seriously by channeling feigned euphoria as part of his character, instead of carrying a down-to-earth charisma like Cooke did. As a result of this, his performance was not believable enough and, ultimately, did not carry enough weight throughout the film.One strong element of this film was its production design. Calling back to Spielberg's work on The Adventures of Tintin, the visual effects offer a remarkable view of a world that has never been seen onscreen before. Beginning with a riveting vehicle race featuring King Kong himself, it makes one wonder why Spielberg has never directed a movie based on an actual video game.In short, READY PLAYER ONE may not be the best film in ages, but there is a lot about this film that simply works. One will be able to find a good a time in being taken on a visual journey and may even get a kick out of some of the pop culture references. Or if one is curious to go through Steven Spielberg's extensive filmography, this is a worthy title of looking into.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Going Outside is Highly Overrated,"Steven Spielberg still has it! If you are looking for an original, entertaining and just plain fun movie with a lot of reference from the 80s, go ahead and buy this movie.

Game on,"Steven Spielberg has been inspired by James Cameron's use of 3D in Avatar as this is a film worth watching on 3D, with set pieces that are ready made for 3D viewing.Spielberg has also gone for a popcorn film full of cultural references to the 1970s and 80s. If you are a vintage arcade geek, a gamer or love 1980s film, this is the film for you.You can glimpse Batman, Robocop, the Tardis, Chucky the doll, King Kong. There are references to Back to the Future, Star Trek and Spielberg sends a affectionate note to one of his idols, Stanley Kubrick.Set in 2045, the world has gone to pot and the population immerse themselves in the virtual world of the Oasis. In Columbus, Ohio; Wade Watts is living in a hell hole called the Stacks with his aunt. He finds a key to an adventure left by the late designer of the Oasis. Wade with his virtual friends have to race to against a ruthless corporation to gain further keys which gives the winner the ownership of the virtual kingdom.The characters are thinly sketched, Wade does come across as naive, displaying a person who has spent more time in a virtual world than real one. The plot is straightforward, nothing very much deep here.Spielberg has infused the film with lots of fun and action. However at times it is too simplistic. When the police show up at the end of the movie, you do wonder where they were for the rest of the time as the bad guys seem to have the real world all to themselves.

Spielberg gets back into the game with one!,"4/1/18. Saw this in the theater today in 2D and worth seeing on the big screen. If you are not a gamer or not still in your teens, then all the visuals may be a bit over-stimulating and overwhelming. Really, no wonder kids can sleep or calm down these days! Anyway, Spielberg paints a very dismal dystopia in which everyone escapes into a virtual world known as Oasis because reality is just so bad. Rylance is the creator of Oasis and upon his death he promises wealth,glory and control of Oasis to the person who can solve his puzzle and win 3 keys to his kingdom. That's the basic premise. Spielberg is back in the game with this movie. He has managed to make a movie that is appealing to the Post-Millennials and well as the Millennial and Generation X. However, Baby Boomers will definitely enjoy all the references to pop culture from the last 40 years that only people who have been around for decades can really appreciate.

Only Barely Resembles Novel,"I can't imagine that anyone who read and liked Ernest Cline's dazzling novel could be satisfied with this film adaptation of it.Which is odd, since Cline co-adapted the screenplay. Maybe he wanted to avoid the trap of the movie never living up to its source, so he decided to take the thing in an entirely different direction so it would be harder to compare the two. In any case, what lives on the screen resembles the novel only in the barest of outlines. Gone is the cleverness of the novel and its geeky reverence for 1980s pop culture. In its place is a soulless attempt to recreate one of those adventure movies from that decade, like ""Goonies"" or ""Back to the Future,"" but without the sensibility to pull it off. Again, very odd given that the director of this film, Steven Spielberg, practically redefined the adventure sci-fi movie. But he feels like the wrong match for this material. The movie is like watching a movie about 80s nostalgia made by someone who doesn't feel it and is trying to manufacture it based on a guess as to what it might feel like.Mostly the film is just visually overwhelming.

I think it's that in this film we see societal escapism and honestly that feels real and maybe hits a little too close to our real world.This movie does a great job at being entertaining and light-hearted while also directing the viewers to have a serious look at the world around them and asks them simply to be apart of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Get Ready For Ready Payer One,"I have recently seen the latest Spielberg movie, and it measures up to greats like E.T., Jaws, and Jurassic Park. Ready Player One is a movie about a virtual world called the OASIS whose creator, James Halliday (played by Mark Rylance) has died. In his will he creates a quest for control of the OASIS, which Parzival (played by Tye Sheridan) had devoted his life to winning. The quest is entirely 80s themed, and is absolutely great.
All of the actors did a great job playing their roles. One of the best was Mark Rylance. He did an exceptional job as James Halliday, and the somewhat crazy man he was. Simon Pegg, who played Ogden Morrow, did a great job being annoyed at the weird kid always wasting his time. 
I loved all the 80s references in the movie. The music was amazing, as well as all of the cameos. Although I was upset at how much it changed from the book, it was still just as good, if not better. The best scene was the final battle, by far. 
I think that the moral is overused, yet important. It teaches that reality is more important than a game. Although it is necessary, it doesn't need to be in every movie and book a child ever reads. But, unlike most movies and books, it is subtle with this moral, and it does a good job of saying it's message without full out calling video games evil, like most movies incorrectly say.
You will like this book if you were a teenager in the 80s, or even a teenager nowadays.

All of the music is some of the most well-known 80s music ever, and all of the videogames are immortalized legends.

"Incredible Surface Value, But No Depth","The immediately noticeable feature of Ready Player One is the CGI and incredible visuals throughout the film, but this is used to blind an audience from an overall storyline which is so-so. The 'gameplay' is entertaining, and the number of references and Easter eggs are enough to make a nerd squeal, but this is ultimately the biggest draw. The story outside of the Oasis is a little lame, the bad guys are hardly sinister and it's difficult to feel that passionate about consequences of actions when you know the worst case scenario is the characters can't play a game anymore. In the context, that is a major outcome, but to a real life audience it's something you cannot connect with.The Shining sequence is brilliant and by far the best part of the film. The treasure map style plot at least moves swiftly, but again, everything outside of the game is a little too convenient. The lead also develops ridiculously strong emotions for a stranger but has no ties whatsoever to his only blood relative. It's just a little disjointed.Ultimately though, the target audience is anyone seriously into gaming or just a little nostalgic, others may find it all a little dull or stupid. References and outside characters are a boost of fun and the storyline is coherent, but the only outstanding elements of Ready Player One are the visuals.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Nerd's Nerd Film,"Ready Player One is quite possibly the biggest ""nerd's nerd film"". What I mean by that is that sure the film can be appreciated by the general public, but there's no question that the large part of the population that goes to see it won't be able to truly appreciate the ins and outs of this Easter egg filled movie. Dozens and probably even closer to hundreds of hidden gems fill this Sci-fi feature helmed by one of the all-time greatest directors, Steven Spielberg. If there's ever a film you wish you could pause, zoom-in, and rewind while in the theater, it's Ready Player One.There is of course, the disappointing element of the film you have to get over, which is that a good chunk of the film (maybe 75%) is in CGI. Once you get passed the fact that the characters you're supposed to grapple onto, and the environments they inhabit, are entirely fake, then there's not much stopping you from having a blast. I thought the performances by Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, and Ben Mendelsohn were all very good, and in Cooke's case, great. The effects and cinematography were about as good as you're going to get without going over budget. And the script was above average.However, the real journey you go to the theater for is the mystery, easter eggs, and the surprises. Boy were there a ton of them here. There's one particular scene, which was somehow not spoiled by any marketing or journalist, that is one of the coolest film sequences I have seen in quite some time. And Spielberg really does a nice job of appealing to the older generations as well as the newer generations. What a ride this film was.8.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
FANSERVICE - the movie,"A pretty dull movie that has an un-engaging mystery at it's core, done by people who obviously never played a videogame in their life.Everything here is window dressing beginning with the 10. 000 cameos of franchise characters, the half-baked love story, an ending that resembles E. T., or the useless references of movies like The Shining (which has nothing to do with videogames but who cares).Another thing that really stood out is when the love interest says she's ugly in real life and of course they cast a beautiful actress in the role and give her an oversized mole.

"I wish Spielberg will keep doing this sort of films, few are equal to him when fantasy is running wild","Must admit, I stopped watching Spielberg's ""based on a true story"" movies long ago, shortly after Empire of the Sun, which I found so melodramatic I could hardly stand it. On the other hand, though I didn't see all his fantasy movies, I usually love'em, even when many don't (I just love Hook to pieces, despite some minor faults).
 
But lets stick to the movie at hand. It's a visually stunning story taking place mostly in a virtual universe, that is - in a movie - since that's what a well made movie really is. So in a way it's a movie about movies, filled with many inside jokes for movie buffs, or if you want to call it as they do in the movie - filled with easter eggs. The story is told superbly, this was always Spielberg's strong suit. The pace is just perfect, the movie runs for more than 2 hours without a single dull moment. Roles are well written, performed very professionally by all, though I must single out Ben Mendelsohn who really shines as the lead villain of the movie.As a rule the movie adheres to the laws of the universe in which it takes place, so it makes sense inside the virtual world we're watching on screen. And as far as I'm concerned this is one of the best fantasy movies I've seen in a long while, and I did see most of the recent ones. I'll rank it in my top three or four of the last two years, but don't hold me to a strict time limit, it could well be one of the the top five of the last five years or so.

"""A place where the limits of reality are your own imagination.""","This visual overload, loosely based on a book, is a fun watch. The CGI is good and the story is OK. What overwhelms is the sheer number of visual references to other movies, TV shows, and computer games. There is a sentimental retro theme, which blends well with the artful hi-tech.The story mostly takes place in the ""OASIS"", which is a Virtual Reality with portals to various games. One can spend time simply exploring, but that isn't covered (aside from a mention in the introduction).This is not a deep film; it relies mostly on spectacle to entertain, and this works surprisingly well. The club dance-floor scene is inspired and arguably the highlight of the film. There's also decent comic relief sprinkled throughout.I give this seven (7) stars; it's not completely satisfying, but it is rewatchable.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not the story it could and should have been,"I wanted to give this movie 4.5 stars but sadly that isn't possible so I am rounding down.When I first heard news of the synopsis of the movie being leaked and that it was vastly different from the book I hoped they fixed some of the issues the book had. Because even though the book is fun, for it being a book focused on people that actually lived through the 80's it lacks serious depth. I graces the hard issues but never really tackles them (what does being alive mean? Online vs Offline live? What is romance?).Going into this movie I had hoped they would touch on some of these issues but right from the start things go wrong. It is easy to harp on this movie for not following the book, but at best 2% of the book can be found in this movie. Wades origin story is off. All the challenges have been altered. All he hard hitting moments of sacrifice and taking risks removed. What you are left with is a watered down ""spectacle movie"" that doesn't make much sense.Aside from that most of the actual 80's references have been cut. Instead we get pop-culture references (Halo, Gears of War, Track mania, Golden EYE). I can sort of understand why, because they wanted to make it PG13 and the PG13 wouldn't get text based games and 80's references, but it takes away from the entire identity of the book.The acting is alright although I can't help but feel they completely wasted Simon Pegg's talent. It actually took me a while to even notice he is in the movie all together. All he is is a bland English voice over. A real shame as he normally adds a lot of character to his characters.Visually the movie is fine. The world outside the Oasis mostly follows the books. The world inside the Oasis is crisp and well rendered. Animations are fluid and facial animations are spot on. This is one of those movies where the 3D is completely tagged on and didn't add anything to the experience however.Overall I can't praise this movie. It's few clever changes are not enough to save it from mediocrity and the few nostalgia moments will hardly excite the real ""nerd"". Had they follow the book this movie would have been, like the book, a solid 7/10. As it is now I can't give it above a 4.5/10 in good conscience.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best movie this year so far,"The visuals in this movie are amazing! With the movie relying heavily on CGI the visuals needed to be good and thankfully they were great. The film is completely different from the book. Almost to the point where they could be seen as too different things. Thankfully it isn't a bad thing. The changes are made simply because the things that happen in the book would not translate well on to screen well at all.There are a lot of references in the film but they are not thrown at you every two minutes. I see some reviews saying that there are too many references but I honestly think the could've put more in. As soon as ""Jump"" by Van Halen started at the beginning of the film I squeeled with delightReady Player One surprised me. When I saw everyone saying Black Panther was the greatest Marvel movie ever I got hyped. Then I saw it and was disappointed. When I heard everyone saying this was a great film, I was worried that the hype would get to me and I would be disappointed again.

An exercise in excess held together by soullessness,"I think Spielberg's lost his way recently. This move is absolutely empty without the pop culture references it reaps upon, without an ounce of subtlety no less (If I want to watch The Shining, I'll watch The Shining. If Spielberg really wanted a highlights reel of The Shining pasted onto his movie, he should be learning to have some restraint). Hollow story, no characters, no emotion, terrible CGI that is reminiscent of current pre-rendered cutscenes (which is pretty accurate but extremely lazy. It would've been nice to see some effort and creativity), hazy and exhausting action sequences, and a hackneyed message about being a gamer and how electronics are bad and should be used in moderation.

A great topping on a mediocre dessert,"RPO is a movie about a very possible future, where rich dominates poor, and VR dominates reality, but also about the power of belief and friendship and love, which is supposed to be more valuable than money and fame.This is a simple premise that could've been given substance, if they focussed more on characters, their background, and their development. Instead, the movie focusses on effects and a lot of cameos. The effects are amazing, the action is pretty entertaining and the cameos from games, movies and superheroes are very recognizable and funny if you lived in the 80's and/or 90's.But after the 1st half, the cameos are no longer surprising, they become gimmicks. The action gets repetitive, and the acting becomes flat. The message becomes too obvious, stretched out and in your face. The movie loses its momentum especially because the lead bad guys seem unmotivated and two dimensional. The movie could have been so much better, if only they invested more in the characters and their motivation. Great effects can not inflate that which is flat. And that is exactly what this movie becomes, after the 1st half.That doesn't mean that the movie isn't entertaining, if only you care enough about the many cameos that might make this movie worth watching a 2nd time, and play beer games.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Ready Player Wonder,"It's clearly overlong. The cute characters tend towards one-dimensional, some of the soundtrack choices are dull and the dialogue could have been sharper.

While the movie adaptation may disappoint some of the fans of Mr. Cline's book (understandably), those interested in pure cinema will find a genius working at the height of his powers creating an entire believable fantasy world on the canvas. Spielberg's unparallelled technique always guides the eye in the right place even in the film's most frenzied moments. Raoul Walsh once stated that there is only one correct place for the camera, and Spielberg understands this - even when he is orchestrating one of his jaw-dropping tracking shots.RP1 is a ride. It's the most fun you can have at the movies right now. The whole movie is such a tidal wave of cinematic wonder that the actors will not get much attention. But it is a nice cast.

Pure Spielberg Magic,"Jam-packed with overwhelming nostalgia & countless references to pop culture of 1970s & onwards, Ready Player One marks Steven Spielberg's return to the genre he single-handedly revolutionised with his sweeping cinematic vision and presents the cinematic game-changer in sublime form as his latest is another larger-than-life extravaganza.The story of Ready Player One takes place in the year 2045 where people regularly visit a virtual reality universe called OASIS in order to escape the desolation of their real lives. The plot revolves around the contest that was announced after the death of OASIS founder, the winner of which will inherit the full ownership & control of the virtual universe.Directed by Steven Spielberg, it's been a long time since a film of his has been this fun, adventurous & freewheeling. Infused with a sense of warmth, wonder & magic that only he can provide, Ready Player One sets its premise by giving an overview of the fundamentals of OASIS with speed & clarity. Every frame is a pop culture galore yet Spielberg makes sure that his film has its own identity.Production design team brings OASIS alive in meticulous detail and the navigation through it is smooth & effortless. While the first race sequence offers an adrenaline high & jaw-dropping thrills unlike anything in recent years, one particular standout is the film's tribute to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, ingeniously recreating the setting, mood & atmosphere of that horror masterpiece right down to a tee.Cinematography operates the camera with kinetic flair for scenes set in the OASIS while events taking place in real world are drenched in cold, desaturated palette to further reflect the dismal world its inhabitants are living in. Editing isn't perfect when it comes to interweaving the drama unfolding in two worlds but the pacing is terrific. 
Instead of Spielberg's long-time collaborator John Williams, we have Alan Silvestri composing the score and he does well to fill up the void.Also worthy of mention are its spectacular visual effects without which Ready Player One wouldn't exist. And as always is the case with a Spielberg film, every VFX shot is exquisitely refined, seamlessly integrated & never feels out of place. Coming to the performances, the cast consists of Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Mark Rylance, Ben Mendelsohn & others, and though there are no standouts, all of them do well with their live-action roles as well as their respective OASIS avatars.On an overall scale, Ready Player One is an endlessly captivating, entertaining & satisfying sci-fi adventure that effortlessly succeeds as an awe-inspiring ode to the genre that cemented Spielberg's own legacy, a heartfelt love letter to cinema, and one nostalgia trip that you may want to revisit again n again. One of the finest films of the year so far, Steven Spielberg's latest is pure escapist bliss in every sense of the word and a cinematic gem for anyone & everyone.

THIS WAS NO GOOD,"Do you like the 80's? Do you like video games? Do you like being pandered to until you want to vomit? Well this would be the movie for you. This movie is less of a movie and more of review of all pop culture of the last three decades. One of the most blaring issues is the onslaught of huge plot holes that are never addressed to any extent. For example, despite the fact that this virtual environment has people playing from all over the world, it just so happens that all prominent characters are located in the same area. It also just so happens that, despite the characters not knowing the other players past their online avatars, immediately recognize each other in the real world. Trust me when I say there are much larger more absurd examples but they contain spoilers so I will refrain from mentioning them. Speaking of characters, the development of each one is a two dimensional paper cutout that does not go beyond ""The protagonist is good"", ""The bad man is bad"", and ""The girl is a girl"". There is no example of any earnest emotion a character displays or lasting impact that a character must persevere through, even when life altering events occur. This movie focuses more on throwing as many pop culture references on screen as it can than it does on presenting the plot effectively or developing any of its characters. I am disappoint.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Very 1980s adventure coated with 2018 effects,"In Ready Player One, though having lots of exposition, Steven Spielberg delivers a wonderfully thrilling first third, but soon afterwards fails to keep the pace and lets the story to gradually succumb to over-reliance on characters and plot twists that were common in 1980s but look sorely outdated and tedious in 2018. This as such is largely in purpose as the story wants to be seen as a tribute to pop-culture - for some reason meaning the 1980s' culture only - but it doesn't make boring the audience any less acceptable. The last real highlight is a magnificent scene in the Shining's hotel.The plot follows characters in the virtual reality and in the real world, jumping back and forth. Action involving the actual people is often poorly staged. Plot rushes from one place to another without much logic. Characters come and go as they please, and it is later difficult to remember what actually happened. The big end fight in the virtual world appears to be staged only because a big end fight needed to be at the end, having no logic, reason or real feeling and bringing nothing new to the long series of purposeless end fights in expensive blockbusters.Hit and miss, and increasingly a miss towards the end, Ready Player One is still a reliable Spielberg that probably will entertain younger audiences more than those who actually remember the 1980s.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Video Game Adaptation Directed By Spielberg ..... This Is My Dream Now!,"If there is any director who can make a successful and really the first great video game adaptation, he will be, of course, Steven Spielberg. The most thing I was worried about in Ready Player One is if it will be a mere thrill ride filled with many pop-culture references rather than it will be a movie with a good story. It turned out that I was right, but only about the first part. This movie is an epic adventure that will mesmerize all nerds and geeks, but it will also satisfy the real cinephiles who seek a movie with a smart and original story. In fact, this movie's story is really powerful and thought-provoking. I found myself engaged with the story and the characters, and also busy as much as the characters as if I was putting the pieces of the puzzle with them.The performances are good, but the movie didn't rely and focus on the dramatic aspect as much as on the adventure aspect. For me this isn't a problem at all, because the movie should be experience it as an epic adventure, like Avengers: Infinity War, not as your typical movie experience.That being said, Ben Mendelsohn as the villain, Nolan Sorrento, gave an awesome performance, and the character itself is very compelling, and it could be the best depiction of a clumsy villain I see in years. Unfortunately, The beta villain, F'Nale Zandor, is a pale character, and Hannah John-Kamen made this character even worse with an over-the-top performance. I felt that she was trying so hard to be like Gazelle in Kingsman The Secret Service, but she is far from Sofia Boutella wonderful performance.I think using the narration to set up the story fast wasn't a good decision, but looking at the full half of the glass, that made the fun begins early, so this kinda a half issue.The movie looks great, and the visual effects are breathtaking. Most of the movie is animated, and the animation is very beautiful and looks like the animation that has been used in video games rather than in animated movies. And that fits perfectly with the theme of the movie. Ready Player One definitely should be nominated for the Oscar for best Visual Effects, for best Sound mixing, for best Sound Editing, and I hope it will be nominated for best Animated Movie!Ready Player One is my second favorite movie of 2018, but it's hands down the most enjoyable movie I've seen this year, and one of the most enjoyable movies I've watched in my life.I still can't believe how this Overlook Hotel sequence has been shot..... no...no... sorry, I forgot it's a SPIELBERG film!(9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

All your review are belong to us.,"I was able to attend a Cineworld preview of the film a couple of weeks before the official release.Wade Watts (Tye Sheriden) lives in a slum high rise in the future dystopia. He, like the rest of the world, escape their daily struggle to live in OASIS, a virtual reality universe where everything and anything is possible. However, there is battle for control of OASIS, pitting its ideological members against a cynical and murderous corporation bent on monetarising the virtual playground.Of course the plot, source novel and even Stephen Spielberg have been secondary in the run up to the release of ""Ready Player One"" as all have taken a back seat to the discussion about the thousands of licenced properties that inhabit the world of the OASIS. Some commenters have found this wave of nostalgia that the films advertising brings to the fore nauseating, so I am happy to report that, in my opinion, the film mostly manages to walk the line between the smart references and endless ""look at this, you used to like this"" moments pretty well. Occasionally they are forced, ( I recognised the bike from Akira, you don't need to literally tell me it's the bike from Akira - and if people don't recognise it, then telling them ""it's the bike from Akira"" isn't really going to mean anything to them), but mostly they are either made integral to the plot or on and off screen so fast they are simply background. It's a film that will reward pausing the film at home, and trying to spot exactly who is who and what is what at a later date.But, apart from the endless cameos what of the actual film itself? It's pretty good, it's a bit patchy and some bits work better than others. Naturally when adapting a novel, even one as superficial as ""Ready Player One"" at lot of the depth has to go. The struggle of the real world is probably the biggest departure, and the idea that people live, work and go to school in OASIS and not just use it for entertainment. There are other changes to make the film more cinematic, gone are much of the sections of the book where Parzival progresses in the Easter Egg Hunt by playing Atari games and they have been replaced by an car race, that opens the film, and a section of the film that is comfortably the films best - set in recreation of the Overlook hotel from ""The Shining"". Whilst talking about that scene, I'm pretty amazed that the film will get away with the 12A rating, based on the horror elements in that scene, some parents might be better seeing it themselves first, before letting younger children see it.Performance wise, the film is a bit all over the place. The two leads, Tye Sheriden as Wade and Olivia Cooke as Samantha/Art3mis are OK. Although over 50% of their performance is vocal / motion capture, their best work is done when they are out of OASIS though. Lena Waithe too, is much better in the real world than when inside the game. Mark Rylance gives another great turn as James Halliday, the creator of the game, he portrays the shy, melancholy nature of the man, without ever slipping into too much cliché. Simon Pegg is less effective, ok playing the younger Ogden Morrow, but struggling when saddled by old man prosthetics. I should say, I saw the film in 3D... which I normally would try and avoid as I find the glasses blurs the action rather than enhancing it... but ""Ready Player One"" always looked clean and crisp, probably the best I've ever felt with the gimmick. 
Enjoyable whilst it lasts ""Ready Player One"" is a fun ride with some excellent parts. I suspect that come the end of the year it'll likely be pretty forgotten, let alone in a Spielberg career retrospective.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Could have been a cult classic, but instead it's an insult to an amazing book,","If you haven't read the book, then this will be a nice fun film to watch with retro references, adventure, and a look at a world where everyone lives on VR.If you have read the book then prepare to be left bemused, gutted, devastated and downright disappointed at what a mess that Spielberg has made from an amazing geek fest book into a mundane movie for the masses.This movie could have been an absolute cult classic of a dystopian future with some amazing insights as to what a future society of Virtual Reality users would look like. But this movie has not only decided to skim over the details of the technology and how far integrated it is in every day life, not only forget building the characters story line and gradually introducing them, but instead has taken the basic story line, along with the characters and then a few key points, throw them in the air and where ever they land write a completely different story in between and Hollywood the hell out of it with absolutely no loyalty to the book. I can not even begin to list how much is missing that would make this film make more sense.In fact this movie should NOT even have the honour of the title Ready Player One, instead it should be called GAME OVER, it is an insult to the book in every way possible.If you are thinking of watching this movie and not read the book, then do as it is probably not a bad film but make sure you read the book after the movie and not before. If you have already read the book, and loved the book then I would not recommend going to see this as it will just infuriate and give you high blood pressure.

"Often exhilerating, but caves into formula","I haven't read the book, so am reviewing this purely as a film. Its technically incredibly accomplished - amazing CGI, a packed, detailed screen most of the time, and the 3d is brilliant (particularly the VR scenes, the real world seemed flatter/duller which may have been intentional for the same effect as Tron Legacy). The sheer dizzying vibrancy of the VR world and all its references is often joyous and refreshing.But as time goes on (and theres a lot of it) I found myself craving some substance, some humanity, some depth, character and originality which doesn't materialise. All the references to Back To The Future make me kind of wish I was watching that instead - how much more loveable the characters are in that. RP1 descends into the same formula as every other mass-market movie - evil baddie, endless destruction, slick invulnerable CGI battles, good guys in great peril, etc etc that drags on a little too long. By the end I was glad it was over, and it had lost my earlier affection. Afterwards it started dissolving fast, without much staying behind. Great entertainment, but I feel like it could have been so much more. Maybe I've been spoiled by Black Mirror.If BTTF was made now, I'm sure Biff would be a megalomaniac evil time-lord trying to destroy the spacetime contiuum, and there would be an extra hour tagged on where Biff teams up with the Libyans to destroy Hill Valley with endless CGI bazooka missiles.One thing I'll say in RP1s favour is that there is an amazing setpiece (the second key) that had me smiling so hard it was worth the price alone.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Mixed feelings,"The movie resides mostly on bringing nostalgic feelings to its audience. 
If you were not here in the 80s and 90s and were never much into games, comics nor anime; then this movie will make absolutely non-sense to you.
If you did, then you will enjoy seeing the mash-up of a bunch of characters and vehicles known to you.
Other than that, the story is just 'meh'. At the same level as a Transformers movie and far from being anything original or anything you were not expecting.Visuals are impressive but sometimes too dark to catch everything that is happening in the screen..
But unfortunately that's mostly it. Feels so empty for a Spielberg movie.

Great Family Movie,"This movie is a must see for family. I first off never read the book, but I am part of the generation this movie is referencing toward. I had an Atari 2600, Intellivison and Colecovision. I was one of the geeks that would spend weekends playing D and D. I was into anime, cartoons and science fiction. But as with all of us, we all grow older with family and responsibilities. That said, I convinced my wife (who was never into Sci-fi or Fantasy movies) and my 12 yr daughter and 9 yr son to see this movie with no prior pre-conceptions. The result was that we absolutely loved it!In the movie the CGI graphics were amazing, my kids were glued to the screen watching all the action and effects. There were never any slow or boring parts in the CGI world. Caution: The part looking for the second key might be intense for younger kids (mine just closed their eyes). All the numerous characters and 80's references my wife and I found definitely gave us nostalgic smile and laughs during the movie.The seamless action and story of the characters in the real world was actually riveting and it felt the long movie run time went by fairly quick. I thought all the characters fitted well and not once did my family groan about a character.I know there has been some negative reviews by people who are comparing it to the book (just like the movie ""Enders Game""). However, if you look at this movie as it is presented to the viewer, it is a fantastic movie! My family could not stop talking about it the last few days. I really enjoyed the ending with the final general message that Spielberg is relaying, where true life and happiness comes from. That powerful underlying message was something my kids took out of this movie, besides the absolute great storytelling.If you have kids, I strongly recommend you take them to see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

In Spielberg we trust,"Steven Spielberg is a director whose name is synonymous with Hollywood blockbusters, having played such a big part in pioneering what they are in film today. Take a look through his back catalogue and you'll see Spielberg has delivered some of the most revered blockbusters of all time. Ready Player One sees Spielberg jump back into the sci-fi fold and it's safe to say that he well and truly feels at home delivering plenty of thrills and spills.When it's revealed that James Halliday (Mark Rylance), the deceased creator and owner of the OASIS, a virtual reality world where people can live out their wildest fantasies, has left three challenges for all players to participate and gain total control of the OASIS as well as his entire fortune, it falls upon Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) a.k.a. Parzival in the OASIS to solve how Halliday's past holds the key to their future. He faces a race against time though in the shape of Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), a corporation man hellbent on getting his hands on both the fortune and control of the OASIS.It's so great to see Steven Spielberg back in the genre of sci-fi, with some of my favourite films of his including Jurassic Park and E.T. coming from a genre he clearly thrives within. The idea of Ready Player One is one that would light up the eyes of a director like Spielberg, what with it's vast virtual world and array of pop culture references (including works of his own), and it's one that he takes full advantage of, delivering a film full of explosive spectacle and pulsating action.Spielberg is my favourite director and I've always been amazed by the sense of adventure he creates when crafting his films. Within the OASIS of Ready Player One, Spielberg delivers some of the most visually stunning sequences I've seen in a long time, made somewhat more spectacular by the impeccable visual effects on show, handy when a large portion of the film is set within the OASIS. The visuals combined with the kinetic energy of the action make for such a feast for the eyes and, even when there's so much happening on screen, nothing seems to get lost in the background.This was the worry going into Ready Player One; that all it would be is just a mishmash of pop culture references that ultimately amount to nothing. While the story might be quite basic and there doesn't seem to be much room for any character development, the references are used in such inventive ways throughout, the highlight being an incredibly entertaining sequence that sees Spielberg toying around with proceedings at the Overlook Hotel, proving that he still knows how to make us all jump. Kids could be left mentally scarred mind.Coming to the performances, Ready Player One features a cast who all help maintain the film's energy to varying degrees. Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke are certainly actors who have very bright futures ahead of them while Ben Mendelsohn showcasing why he should be the go-to-guy for villainous roles in future projects, his turn as Sorrento here being one of the film's high points.While Ready Player One may not be Spielberg's greatest film, it provides a near two-and-a half hour experience at the cinema full of immense fun. It'll be interesting to read the source material however, for now, I'd advise anyone to just buckle up and enjoy the wild ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fun, popcorn movie! Read the book as well though!","I get it! It's not a page for page recreation of the book, but that's what happens in adaptations.Cline wrote the book, and helped write the script. In college i learned that the most important part of adapting books to scripts is telling the linear narrative.How do we get Wade from point A to point B while keeping as many elements of the book without it being obtrusive on the narrative.In this respect, the film nails it in spades 
It's Spielberg at his most creative. He directs in a world full of possibilities and wonder that serve as eye candy while the story thrusts us into this dystopian Ohio.In the end, it's a fun, escapist film that reminds those of us of a certain age how great are childhoods were, with literally 1000's of pop culture references.But read the book along with seeing the movie, to round out the whole narrative.Both are excellent!!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Given that there's too much detail in the book to fully convey in a movie, and that movies are rarely better than the book version of the story, I was pleasantly surprised by Spielberg and the writers' interpretation. Yes, there were many parts of the book omitted, and scenes added that were not in the book, but the end result was a highly entertaining movie! It was a great ride from start to end, and the core of the book is well represented in the movie.

80s references a plenty,"REVIEW - READY PLAYER ONEI was very fortunate to have been invited to see an advanced screening of this film before it's world premiere so I must just say that the following is my own personal opinion.During the summer of 2017 filming for this film took place in and around Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter and Spaghetti Junction so this film as with Kingsman (which was filmed on Colmore Row) was of particular interest.Tipped to be a blockbuster of a film in parts I can certainly agree, I predict it will do well at the cinema but for me the film was split, let me explain.Rated 12A here in the UK the film is intended for children of 12 up and accompanied by an adult and generally the film could have got away with a general 12 rating except for one quick scene involving a very famous doll which comes to life and the human swearing (which was a shock).The story was interesting enough without being too complicated, the general level of acting was OK but for me as I've said by far the only reason to go and see this film are for the parts inside the oasis!For us adults there are references of the 80s both films and games and for the other audience members just the sheer pleasure of witnessing such an impressive visual computer generated world, truly amazing! But because it seems to me) most of the budget was spent on this then the real world sequences suffered.Don't get me wrong, the film is very enjoyable and I intend to watch it again on DVD or streaming when its released just so I can pause it and see even more of the 80s film and game references.Rating 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
not for me but the 3D was stunning,"Took me a while to see this one but my wife saw it on a plane and said it was okay. I waited so long because the further we go into Spielberg movies the less I do like them. They are more ane more into a Disney fairytale. But when my father-in-law presented this on 3D to watch I did give it a try.Starts off rather good with a lot of action going on, espescially the race with all those features that you will recognise when you are into gaming. But once that was over I didn't get a grip on this flick. It just didn't got my attention. Don't get me wrong, it isn't that bad but it isn't vintage Spielberg for me.But they also told me to watch in in 3D because it do adds and I agree. Due computer animation they were able to exaggerate the 3D effects. They were stunning. Especially when they are in the virtual world. But again, I will forget this movie rather quickly for a Spielberg flick.But teens will love this and gamers will love this, that I can assure you.Gore 0/5

I was ready,"Ready Player One was a brilliant movie about the impending digital future. The main setting was The Stacks in Columbus, Ohio 2045. Scratch that. The main setting was a virtual world called the Oasis; Columbus, Ohio was nothing more than the derelict real world that the main character, Wade, lived in.In this not-too-distant future there is gross overcrowding and real life sucks for just about everyone. No worries because just about everyone escapes this reality to a virtual reality called the Oasis. The Oasis is a virtually limitless digital world in which you can do just about anything and be just about anyone. It is the great escape.The founder and creator of this world died and left behind an Easter egg that--if found--makes the finder the sole owner and operator of the Oasis. Oh yeah, and they inherit the company worth $500B. No biggie. Of course everyone wants to find this Easter egg but the race for this Easter egg has real world consequences when a rival company will stop at nothing to win.One thing that made the movie fun and cool was the fact that they were in a virtual world. That's not new or unique but it made the CGI less obtrusive. Because they were in this virtual world you fully expect everyone and everything to look digitally generated which allows you to rate the graphics from a video game perspective as opposed to a movie perspective.Looking into the overall theme of the movie it was a bit sad though the movie never emitted a somber tone. People were happier spending their time in a virtual world being different people, different beings, different objects as opposed to being themselves doing things in the real world. There is very little that is sadder. The movie Surrogates with Bruce Willis explore this same theme in a different manner.But going back to RPO (that's Ready Player One, not the football term run-pass-option), I couldn't help but feel sorry for everyone in the movie as they frolicked around their digital paradise. They're lives were so inextricably linked to their avatar and the Oasis that virtual losses made them react demonstrably in real life. That is quite scary!The truth is we may not be too far from that as a reality. As it is we spend a lot of time in a digital world. Whether it's video games, social media, or other entertainment we are dominated by the digital world. So how big of a leap is it to have an ubiquitous virtual universe where everyone co-mingles? Your brother is in China, husband in Afghanistan, kids in college... no worry, strap on your VR glasses, put on your VR suit and meet with them on the moon, or middle earth or wherever. It could happen. But for now we'll settle for an exciting movie about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Surprisingly good film that's got Spielberg written all over it.,"Ready Player One is based off Ernest Cline's book of the same name, and boy what leverage to draw a movie upon: this movie is like Spielberg's love letter for all-things pop-culture related; there's callbacks to Back to the Future, King Kong, AKIRA, Mad Max, Batman, Legend of Zelda, Star Wars, Sonic the Hedgehog, Atari, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, The Iron Giant, The Shining, Monty Python: it's crazy how many references there are in this video game love-letter of a film.Ready Player One is a rollicking good time at the movies, and has a very 80s-esque charm and vibe to it that Spielberg single-handedly helped create during the milestone-decade. Sure the film's got a tonne of spectacle that may be too much for some, but for me all the references helped tie the backbone of the story: it's a story of a fanboy who's observing the world through a digital lens built upon generations of fandom and world-building, and wants to make his life-inspiration (James Halliday) proud.If you're a lover of all-things gaming, cinema, television and comic-books indiscriminate of genre, Ready Player One is the film for you.

"Its not for everybody, but if its for you, then damn, what a time you will have.","Full disclosure. I've never read the book. I am an avid gamer. I love RPGs. I love pop culture. I love Superheros. I love Anime. I grew up watching many of the references in this film. From the moment I saw the first trailer I was hooked and intrigued how this would play out. Would it be as shallow as it looked? Would it fold under the weight of its own ambition? Would it be played seriously or fun?Going in blind but hopeful was probably a blessing in disguise. I really didn't know what to expect. I've long stopped trusting reviews (he says, writing a review) for our experiences of what we see on screen are so subjective, it doesn't really matter what other people think or feel or (allegedly) what they are paid to say. It really only matters what a movie does for you.For the first time, perhaps ever, I felt the movie was written just for me. The geek in me cracked a smile from the very first scene and it never left. Yes, the pulp culture references were cool, but it was more than just a painting where you point out the cameos.As a commentary on where we are as a society and where it could go in the future, it was interesting to see the widespread adoption of VR. Some of the themes are already happening, others not too far away. The question of ""why do stuff in the real world when you can do it better in the online world"" is one already being asked. There's a great montage of the real world inhabitants doing a wide range of activities in their own houses, looking absolutely ridiculous but not giving a damn.The actual mechanics of the Oasis plays out like a cross between facebook, Warcraft, multiplayer first person shooters - basically anything that we have online. There really isn't a game there other than freedom and the hunt for the easter egg. You just try and gain as much stuff and experience to level up, whilst paying in real world money to get better gear and weapons. Pretty accurate as things go.The main plot for the control of the Oasis and the hunt for the Easter Eggs is as simple as anything in Lord of the Rings. But its the journey we go through, both in the Oasis and the real world where the paradoxes are expertly played out. There is subtle touches that may be missed (the Oasis, where everybody goes to be social, yet nobody knows your real name), the deception of everything (you have a best friend, but you don't even know what they look like), the battle against the corporations who want to use the Oasis for advertising (ring a bell?) against those that just want to keep it free. These and more themes are constantly questioned but never really explored in any detail - they are background hints served as world building as to not distract from the spectacle of the action.And what action. For once, a trailer hasn't spoiled the best bets, there are entire acts of the film that are simply mind blowing. The balance between real/oasis is almost perfect, and constantly the witty script had me smiling and laughing.But...and it is a but...the reliance on pulp culture means its not for everybody. What I found hilarious, others may just stare at the screen in confusion. Its a toure de force of previous films and characters from all walks of life, across multiple genres and brings in RPG techniques that many people may not fully get.But if you do get it, then boy, do you get it. An outstanding achievement in film making, and to be honest, one I never thought we would have the pleasure of watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Will Spielberg bring back that lost art of making a good Matinee movie?,"It's easy to dismiss RPO the movie, it's a lighthearted and predictable adventure aimed for families with a sprinkle of oddities and hard sci fi concepts here and there but never going very deep. But that's ok because the movie does not aim for high art but for pure entertainment, and it delivers.It's funny all those book fans giving crap to the movie but forgetting completely that was Ernest Cline himself that adapted his story to the screen! And I'm glad they changed it because as a movie a faithful translation of the book would be terrible, there is still a lot of telling and explaining to the audience, which is often a bit annoying but thankfully not very long, the many pop culture references are still here but organically used both as a world building tool or as plot devices that blend with the narrative and not become more important than the movie itself and only for that alone I must say this is a sucessful adaptation even if not a perfect package. And If you are invested in the universe you can still read the book and fill the gaps the movie left, they compliment each other.The characters are very much archetypes, but still charming enough to invest in their journey, there's a certain naiveness that makes Ready Player One feel like an 80's movie made with today's technologies and sensibilities, i was surprised that Spielberg, at the age of 71, could still speak to a modern audience like this although the good old men still comes out with a slightly patronizing but valid message ""kids, don't waste too much time in the virtual world"" because as older people (I'm 45) we know that this is some time we'll never get back.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Whoever finds them will be the next heir to all video games. There is also a parallel story with a fantastic universe created in the future. Where everyone can enter the Virtual world while in the 'real world' we have a dystopian reality where everything is practically destroyed. A boy without resources is determined to obtain this inheritance.Different audio references, music and tributes complements the film . Spielberg stated that it is definitely not a masterpiece, but it is certainly a movie for family.Made to be viewed in 3D with mind-blowing special effects that I really don't think you can appreciate on a small screen. Due to the amount of special effects in the middle of the film they stopped filming to start developing them and in that space Spielberg made the film The Post, with Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

There are (sometimes quite big) differences between the book and the film, but the latter does an excellent job of capturing the spirit of the original.

1980s pop culture easter egg hunt,"Well this is the perfect ""Father and Son bonding over a movie"" watching experience. Dad will catch most if not all of the 1980s and early 1990s pop culture and video game references, blasted in quick repetition. Son will enjoy a story based on his favourite pasttime - complete with all the trappings of modern on-line gaming, pay-to-play, cheating, hacking, and corporate privacy issues. At least Daddy will remember a simpler time before video gaming turned into the morally ambiguous swamp. And yes, that leads us straight to the plot of this story, with it's ""Willy Wonka"" inspired moral. Nice and predictable, sugar-coasted, and unsurprising.Having never read the book, I have a feeling that it was more dystopian and darker than what we see on screen. The pacing of the movie goes so quick that anyone not well versed in videogaming lore is going to be getting lost really quickly in the dialogue while trying to understand just what in the heck is really going on. That said, the correct market segment had to be targeted, so here we are with a Spielberg directed romp through the video game arcade with a group of teens.Sadly that aspect of it is probably going to turn a lot of more adult viewers off, but hey - there's some serious CGI chops being shown off in this movie. Why then, does it remind me so much of Avatar? Maybe because it feels like I'm watching someone else play a video game? The film tries to bootstrap itself with real stakes and suspense, but the cartoony world makes it all feel unearned.This is box-office fodder and it doesn't take itself too seriously. Just as well then, that I couldn't either. It was an entertaining easter egg hunt spotting all the 1980s pop references, but I also feel that the story doesn't really get out of it's pixellated two-dimensional treatment of the subject matter and into fully rendered 3D when it had every reason to do so. We're stuck in the Chocolate Factory when in fact we need to be in the Matrix. Is reality the only thing that's real? Well, what if it's not? Will the people of this movie put down the game long enough to rebuild their real world? Will the computers running the virtual reality sim have their resources switched to running protein folding simulations to discover a cure for cancer? This movie has no answer.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent Interpretation of the Book,"The movie is not the same as the book in many ways, but the screenplay was done with Ernest Cline fully involved - so if it is OK with the author then that is fine it is the Author's right to do what he wants with it. Besides which American movie studios have totally misrepresented actual historical events to the point of sillyness in film it seems a bit ludicrous to castigate a movie about a VR world and game for not being ""true"" - laughable really. As for the actual movie it was brilliant, well scripted, pacey, just the right mixture of every aspect of making a proper action movie by the numbers, which Mr Spielberg, as always makes look effortless. As a child of the 70s / 80s and a gamer I loved everything about the movie, I still have a working Atari 2600 console and a PET and a Dragon stashed and a Commodore 64 stashed somewhere, and some games. The cultural references in the movie were and are an integral part of my life and work ever since. So for me this movie was a blast from the past and hugely enjoyable. Not Oscar materiel but then neither was Star Wars or Back to the Future, and look what boring rubbish did win top awards in the 80s - Driving Miss Daisy was one - seriously! My point is that Ready Player One is about gaming and computing history and pop culture underneath the story, so it does not really matter about the story I loved it for the sheer joy of trivia that is important to millions of the original geek generation I was, and still am, a fully paid up member being displayed. Lastly the one thing as a kid I used to dream of was a fully immersive VR gaming system, as did probably everyone else my age into arcade games, and yes it did start with Adventure and The Atari 2600 and now I have Occulus Rift - so this move may turn out to be close to the truth in 2045.

Tron+ Gamer= Ready Player One,"One thing's for certain, I'm glad I waited till this was on demand. I knew about the book but had no interest in reading it because while I love playing video games, it's not something I'd like to read about. It's kind of like a novelization of a movie centered around a sports team. With that being said, the movie was better than I thought.The CGI is very well polished and detailed and I liked how the Oasis was illustrated. Outside of the CGI, the story was severely lacking in both characters and plot.The bad guys are so stereotypical it's annoying. They show no other degree of personality outside of being the typical cutthroat corporate types. The good guys also lacked any degree of human emotion outside. Outside of playing in the Oasis, there was little at stake for the main cast. The movie centers on straying away from online media but it touches base on this notion very lightly. In truth, the movie is really about how many pop culture references can you cram in a 140 min runtime.I'm on for nostalgia if it actually compliments the ongoing story set in the present. RPO sort of treats nostalgia like an excited four year old kid who can't stop pointing and shouting at his favorite pop culture icon from the 80s.As for the plot of the movie, it was all right if not too predictable. The final battle felt bloated and could had easily been shaved in half its runtime. I was too busy checking my watch than actually watching that scene.This is a great movie to watch if you're bored.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"No Masterpiece, but fun trip down memory lane.","Spielberg provides a film that marries 80s pop culture nostalgia with a VR gamer's delight. Set in the dystopian future, the movie is half real world and half computer generated (sadly, not quite up to par for 2018 technology). The legendary director weaves a coming of age tale that has the underdog battle the corporate Big Boss.The story itself does not waiver too much in terms of overall story arc, nor does it have much of a twist. However, there is enough here to keep gamers and children of the 80s & 90s entertained, and manages to do it PG13.Is Spielberg back on top after this performance? Not quite, but its barrels of fun and a shift back to form from the visionary that created JAWS, ET, and Jurassic Park.Recommended in 4dx seats.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Easter Eggs,"It's good to see a sci-fi movie where the writers actually did some research - did their homework.
First, a comment on the main complaint from low rating reviews about it not following the book. Movies and books are different mediums w/different ways of presenting/emphasizing their POVs. And, every retelling of a story will change it, often for the better.The CGI, action, dialogue were so overwhelming it might require seeing twice to appreciate it all. The mostly '80s music wasl spot on - must have been a good decade for music. The subtle cameos by Chucky, Railgun, MechaGodzilla, Wired Magazine, a Gandalf typecast were hilarious.My only negative is the over emphasis on teen heroes, teen stereotyping and subsequent romance all to attract that large paying demographic.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A pop culture reference heaven.,"<WARNING: MILD SPOILERS AHEAD>Ready Player One is one of my most anticipated movie of 2018. I mean, King-Kong, T-rex from Jurassic Park, The DeLorean, and many more all in one movie? Sold. I was born in 2001. I'm 17 years old now. I wasn't supposed to know all these old references considering my age, so why I'm excited for a movie filled with mostly 80'-90's pop culture? It's because I grew up with them. I grew up with Mega Man, Street Fighter, and many more. I don't even watched The Iron Giant yet! (I'll watch it, I promise). But nevertheless, the hype is unbearable to me. The hype just get even better when I found out that the movie is directed by the one and only Steven Spielberg. This movie can't go wrong, right?At last, the wait is finally over. Totally worth it.For starters, the cast are great! Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke and Bel Mendelsohn really did a great job as Parzival/Wade, Art3mis/Samantha, and Nolan Sorrento respectively. The supporting cast did a great job as well. Simon Pegg, Mark Rylance, and T.J. Miller stood out for me. They really did a good job as Ogden, James Halliday, and i-R0k (though I don't really buy the latter as a bad guy).The visual effects are stunning! Everything looks stunning and mesmerizing. The action scenes were frantic and fast, yet we still be able to tag along. The music really stood out for me. Alan Silvestri's score is both loud and exciting, and makes all the action more intense and more impactful.The pop-culture references... There's sooo many of them, so multiple screenings required for you easter-egg hunters. And these references, they all felt necessary to be there, and some of it actually took a big part of the story. I lost count of how many times I genuinely ecstatic to see some of the pop culture reference that I recognize appears on the screen. Chun-Li, and the Hadouken from Street Fighter, the Akira bike, Tracer from Overwatch, the Spartans from Halo, Chucky the Killer, etc. You name it, you got it. The best part? A player summoned a Gundam in Japanese during the big battle against Mechagodzilla (reminds me of Mako from Pacific Rim).However, this movie isn't perfect. There are some issues I had with the movie. There's really a lot of exposition; people telling us the story, rather than moving along with the story. This happens a lot of times, and It bogged down the movie a bit. Some of the references were shoehorned in some scenes that I thought was unnecessary. And finally, the ending isn't satisfying in my opinion, needs something more than that.Overall, I really enjoyed Ready Player One. It was worth the wait, and is currently one of my favorite movies this year. I do hope they make a sequel, but considering that the author of the book is currently writing the sequel, I don't think that we're gonna have one soon. Go watch this movie at a theater near you as soon as possible. 3D viewing is recommended for even more appreciation to all the work that's been made.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A product of the Hollywood machine,"Ready Player One is a decent book. It has some flaws, but overall it works as an '80's nostalgia trip and a good read. Ready Player One is a bad movie in terms of being a movie, an atrocious adaptation, and fails even as a vehicle for '80's nostalgia. There are more easter eggs, shout outs, and throwbacks for people born in recent years than there are for people who grew up in the 1980s. The plot is as formulaic as anything ever produced by Hollywood. It is distinctly and safely structured to be everything the audience has ever seen before, to the point that the end result is dull. A good adaptation will keep what works and fix what doesn't. This movie changes everything regardless of its functionality, and the result has so many gaping plot chasms and is so devoid of charm it's a wonder if Steven Spielberg and company wanted to make this adaptation at all or if they were being forced to fulfill a contract they signed in years past. After having seen this on the big screen, I wish I had waited for it to come to Netflix.

This Game Couldn't End Soon Enough,"I wanted to like Ready Player One, but I didn't.I really wanted to like it because it soothed my ego to believe that a legend like Steven Spielberg could deliver a massive hit like the ones he produced during my childhood, any time he wanted too-and he may have (the box office has not come in yet). The only difference is, I did not feel that cinema magic he is known to deliver while watching this film. If anything, it felt more like watching Michael Jordan when he joined the Washington Wizards as a ball player. Sure, he was technically proficient at the job, but it was not the same as the Chicago Bulls era Jordan. That is what this Spielberg movie felt like-a movie that should have given up sooner. And at 2 ½ hours long, you'll understand what I mean.Ready Player One is based on the 2011 sci-fi novel about a teenager named Wade Watts, who lives in the futuristic, dystopian slums of Columbus Ohio. It seems everyone in the world is hooked on a virtual reality simulator called the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation) where people can engage in all types of simulations to satiate their needs and desires. Now hidden within the simulation is an adventure quest called Anorak's Quest-a challenged bestowed upon the gamers in the OASIS by one of the creators of the simulation-James Halliday. Winning the search will lead to immense wealth (trillions of real world dollars) and actual world ownership of the virtual reality world known as the OASIS. That's a hell of a prize and Wade is determined to win it. What die-hard gamer wouldn't want to go for such an award? Even better, what corporation wouldn't try to capitalize off that opportunity? Luckily, Ready Player One answers that question in the form of our antagonists-an evil, faceless corporation named IOI (Innovative Online Industries).IOI's CEO-Nolan Sorrento-and his army of virtual reality indentured servants, who look like futuristic Planet Fitness customers, all work tirelessly to defeat the challenge. Seems like a pretty cool concept, right? I get why it was made into a movie. Now, I have no exposure to the source material, so I'm reviewing it solely as a movie, but the setup for Ready Player One is excellent. It's the midpoint and conclusion that are brutal to dredge through.The film opens with the same spectacular car race you've seen in all the trailers, and it's as thrilling and nauseating as any scene you've ever seen in a Michael Bay movie. Which is odd for Spielberg because he's a master at showing action in a discernible way that maintains the intensity without vomit inducing editing. From that scene, Wade readjusts his strategy and figures out how to win it and secure the first of three keys to winning Anorak's Quest. He also shares the secret with a competitive gamer he's enamored with (Art3mis), and a small circle of players (Aech, Daito, and Shoto) who form his gamer squad. Aech (aka Helen Harris) is a giant black male avatar with Neanderthal and cyborg features whose indeed a woman in the real world of this film. This wouldn't be a problem for me if all of Aech's companions weren't given beautiful avatars while Aech's is horrific in appearance. Is it a statement of Aech's self-worth as written in the book-perhaps-but that same message could have been delivered without reinforcing offensive Hollywood stereotypes about people of color that have existed since the dawn of cinema. The character is portrayed by real world actress, Lena Waithe-a fellow Chicagoan and Columbia College alum like myself. To see such a talented woman represented this way is disappointing and I would think Spielberg would know better. But I digress. It's on to the second act, and this is where things seem to improve before falling flat. In the second act, a scene that plays homage to The Shining is one of the best moments in the film, but after that, the cat and mouse chase between our hero gamers and the hokey villains at IOI drag on far too long and in an incoherent manner. I wasn't remotely bothered like I usually am to have to take a bathroom break during the movie (and I was assured I didn't miss a thing when I did).Ready Player One's biggest problem isn't the visuals-Spielberg and his team nails that. It's the lack of character development. There was never a time I felt vested in the fate of these characters. Even the characters are dismissive about the stakes in their lives. Wade's family is killed by the CEO of IOI, and his expression of grief is as short-lived as a gamer whose avatar dies at a crucial point in the game, but they get over it quickly because they know they get to keep playing the game. The attempts at humanity are muddied by Halliday's cryptic musings about love and life, and the characters in the game never seem vested in saving the lives of their avatar companions. That's because there are no real world stakes like there were in the Matrix where if you died in the real world, your avatar died as well. Well, there are stakes, just not stakes you care about, like the loss of all the coins they've collected. That's how empty Ready Player One is. Human life isn't valued in this film. Neither is humor because it's quite stale. All that matters in Ready Player One is the goal of winning the game. That seems contradictory to Halliday's original intent for the OASIS-valuing life over winning the game.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I never thought I'd turn off a Spielberg movie without finishing. A first time for everything.,"I made it through a little more than half an hour. I couldn't take any more than that. It made no sense that everyone in 2045 was obsessed with 1980s pop culture. Buckaroo Banzai? Give be a break. Kids today have no clue what that movie is. The idea that it would be the favorite movie of a kid in 2045 is ludicrous. It also made no sense that state of the art 2045 computer graphics look like 2018 graphics.More importantly, it was just BORING. I didn't care about a single thing on the screen.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Action Packed, Visually Inventive and a Beautiful Celebration of Pop Culture","Ready Player One is another in a long line of movies that's going to invite some strong opinions. Based on the best-selling novel by Ernest Cline, the movie isn't restricted by the source material and decides to go its own direction. I can hear people already getting upset but stay with me, what they decided to put on the screen is an actual improvement. Cline does a great job in the book in bringing in cryptic and familiar references alike, but you should be able to recognize all the major references in the movie. As someone who enjoyed the movie, I think its going to help the movie reach a bigger audience.Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) is a protagonist that doesn't defy expectations but is familiar enough to be accessible. He's the underdog hero that's down on his luck, living in Columbus, Ohio in 2045. Wade is living in a trailer park where each unit form ""stacks"" to save space. As Wade tells us through the opening narration, reality became so bleak that the focus shifted from trying to solve the world's problems and instead trying to find ways to escape them. The OASIS became that escape, it's a huge virtual reality universe created by James Halliday (Mark Rylance) and Ogden Morrow (Simon Pegg) that allows you to experience anything. At the start, we see that James has passed away and has left his controlling interest in the OASIS up for grabs in the form of an Easter egg hunt. 3 challenges in which you win 3 keys, and no one has beat the first challenge yet. Wade and his friends Aech (Lena Waithe), Sho (Philip Zao) and Daito (Win Morisaki) compete for it fulltime and with the inclusion of Wade's crush Art3mis (Olivia Cooke). Standing in their way is Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendhelsohn) the CEO of IOI (Innovative Online Industries) and his army of employees/indentured servants. Nolan's vision for the future of the OASIS clashes with Halliday and Morrow's vision, he doesn't see a paradise, he sees potential for ad revenue and microtransactions.So, if you're looking at the summary and it sounds like it might be a little too obscure for you, there's plenty to enjoy with Ready Player One. With most of the movie taking place in cyberspace, we not only spend plenty of time with Wade in Columbus, but we spend most of the movie with Wade's avatar Parzival in the OASIS. The movie relies a lot on CGI graphics, but they look fantastic. I was so immersed in each world the movie decided to visit, from a fiery molten wasteland in Planet Doom to surfing waves. To sell the plot, the visual effects needed to be top notch and the artists behind-the-scenes were up to the task. This was compounded by the jaw-dropping action scenes. If you've seen the trailers, the first challenge is an unbeatable race with unique challenges. I was blown away by this sequence, I couldn't believe that someone like Spielberg helped create it. It would have been easy to just do the same old thing but he and his team (including screenwriters Zak Penn and Ernest Cline) came to work and made something worth going to see.Even though a lot of the movies goes through the avatars, all the actors and actresses still get time to bring something to the table. Tye Sheridan is decent as Wade, he's playing the bright-eyed optimistic hero that's a little too naïve. There were times where he sunk into the part but other times he was too plucky to buy. The supporting cast picked up the slack, Olivia Cooke was strong as Art3mis, her character is less abrasive in the movie and it gives her a chance to show her natural chemistry with Sheridan. She's a hero in her own right and Cooke does a great job. Lena Waithe was just as good as Aech, her character has some twists that could have been difficult to handle but she handles them capably. Ben Mendelsohn does as much as he can as Sorrento, he's not the most captivating villain. But Mendelsohn is a veteran at being menacing and he brings his creepy demeanour to play. Mark Rylance is a frequent Spielberg collaborator and there's a reason he won an Academy Award. Simon Pegg was also a welcome addition, you're always happy to see him.Ready Player One isn't a flawless movie but I could get around most of the minor problems. I found the choices for the score to be really on the nose, from using We're Not Going to Take It as the hype song before the battle to Stayin' Alive as the club music, I would have picked something a little less obvious. It was also hard to buy into some of the movie's more emotional moments. Some of the dialogue between Parzival and Artemis is cringe-worthy. There was also an effort to smooth out the rougher parts of Cline's book, his vision of Wade's reality was a lot darker and this version of the future was pleasant by comparison.This movie is a triumph for Steven Spielberg, even if it borders on being hokey in small bits. I couldn't believe that an established veteran director delivered such an energetic and fun movie that fires references like one of the characters handling a minigun. This might upset the diehard fans, but I am among the faithful and the departures they take boost the material instead of detracting from it. I can't imagine that even if you haven't seen most of the included properties, you won't find something to enjoy or laugh about. With the number of obscure nods and winks, just by sheer volume, the odds are something that will hit. I recommend this highly and I would happily go to the theatre to experience Ready Player One again.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An incredibly beautiful representation of MMORPGs (and video-games in general),"This movie is incredible in so many ways !First, it takes place just 10/20 years from now, in a world that is so close to what we can imagine : virtual reality with believable technology (we already have VR headsets, and game consoles are going right in the direction of the other VR tech of the movie which is toward a complete VR feedback), cities expanding with people pushing their real life and body in the background, companies way too powerful.
As for the virtual world, it is so much better than Jumanji : avatars, weapons, references to Minecraft/Halo/..., and an incredibly precise understanding of the reasons why gamers play !I had the impression that the scenario was carefully planned, like the quest that the movie caracters are following : the action is quite basic, but the morale is really strong and really underlines how interesting it is to go beyond the rules and to be honest. It is rapidly clear what the movie wants to teach us, but it is so well done that you won't feel bored !
Basing the movie on the Easter Eggs was an incredible idea, as it is one of the key things we do while playing : searching for glitches, bugs, hidden menus, discovering new places, etc !I'm no expert, but the CGI felt really great, probably because it was of the same level as the best current video games.As for the acting, I think it was well played even if it isn't breathtaking, the 11 yo guy was a funny caracter (even if the real underraged players are usually more annoying and not so grown-up). But it is entirely sufficient for this movie, as it takes place in the virtual world most of the time.So if you want to have a great time, this is a really good movie !

Even So-So Spielberg Is Fun,"The supermavens were complaining this was a terrible adaptation of the novel a couple of weeks before any of them had seen it. Being a mere human being (at least, that's what I try to convince my neighbors, even though I think they're catching on), I expected I would enjoy it, but would reserve any decisions about its inherent excellence until I had done something unheard of in the critical community, to wit, looked at it myself.It was a big-budget high-tech thing. Tye Sheridan lives in a slum 20 years hence, but his real world is a virtual one, created by Mark Rylance. Mark has died, and has announced that his shares in his trillion-dollar corporation and control of the virtual world will belong to whoever completes an in-game quest. So Tye and assorted friends get involved in in-game and real-life strife, because other big companies want the money too.The novel this was based on had some serious points to make and it looks to me that Spielberg came down more heavily on the entertainment side of the novel....but certainly didn't ignore the reality of it. It's not a deep movie, but Spielberg likes to turn out the occasional money-maker too, and given the somber and thoughtful The Post, he's entitled to a little impeccable fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A fun, colorful action romp. Not much more.","I have not read the book so I can't touch on how the movie stands up to that, but as far as a movie by itself it was passable. A large portion of the movie is told strictly through animation and CGI, and it stands up well and doesn't intrude on the story. The story however, does run into a lot of fundamental problems that might have attentive viewers rolling their eyes.Without engaging too heavily in spoilers, there are what the narrative tries to tell us are supposed to be romance scenes that are either completely laughable or difficult to watch, and basically goes from slightly interesting to basic cut and dry fairy-tale rather quickly.If you're a parent, you can probably take your kids to enjoy it and you'll be able to sit through it (as long as you're okay with the oddly liberal usage of swear words that feel thematically strange in the context of what seems like a family friendly movie) and your children will have fun with the action scenes, CGI and any pop culture references they might recognize.However if you want to go into this movie seeking any sort of depth outside of what is just another CGI filled popcorn movie, maybe you'll be disappointed.

Not for non-gamers,"I've not read the book and most negative reviews appear to come from those who have read the book. I would've thought by now, that people would know that it is very rare film can live up to or better a book. So never go to the cinema, switch on the TV etc. expecting a dramatisation of a book to be as good... a book as time to slowly build something, it is time to develop characters, it can be as quick or as slow as it wants. A film has to pack everything into a short space of time and hold the audience's attention while doing so. 
However, this is really a film for serious gamers. If you've never wasted 5 whole years, literally 24/7 in a game, building up online friendships and virtual relationships with people you've never met or unlikely to ever meet and been part of a gaming community... then you will not fully appreciate some of the nuances in the characters of this film and will be unable to bypass the pop culture references. 
I was tempted to give this 10/10 just for their reactions of meeting their rl selves. I will never forget the moment when my guild revealed their true voices in Teamspeak for the very first time. The first moment when you find out who is a block called Chuck living in their mother's basement, who is genuinely female, who is an adult, and who is a child. It was the funniest thing that I've ever experienced in online gaming... especially as nearly all the female characters were played by men, and all the male characters were played by women. And then when you actually meet fellow gamers for meets ups etc. It is a mindblowing experience... perhaps not as much these days as it was in the early days before the likes of Teamspeak, Ventrillo etc. 
So if you don't have that gaming experience, you will probably not enjoy this film so much. Similarly, I think if the book is one of your all time classic reads, then you might be a bit disappointed too. But if you've got the xp and willing to suspend the book... then this film is a blast... the pop culture stuff just adds or takes away depending on your perspective from the gaming experience. 
Give it a go... seems like it is going to be a love or hate film. For me, I enjoyed the ride, and made me log back in for the first time in a couple of years... to a fanfare of 'hey wb... long time... where have you been?' etc. But I've got rl to live now... so it was nice to catch up with ppl again, but unlikely to drag me back 24/7.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Colorful Road To Nowhere.,"Ready Player One (2018).Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.Parzival (Tye Sheridan) must locate three hidden keys to save the Oasis from ruination and control by Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). Parzival teams up with a group of unlikely allies - but will their combined skills be enough to save the Oasis?Director Steven Spielberg (A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, Close Encounters Of The Third Kind & Minority Report) with writers Zak Penn & Ernest Cline deliver a film that is high in visual spectacle but low in plot. The story of Parzival is not unique or original, but that is not where the fault lies: The problem is that the reason for the film's existence is utterly lost amongst the plethora of digital Easter eggs hurled at the viewer. Somewhere amid all the cavorting game avatars, and after the opening act, Ready Player One just starts to exist on its own with no clear relation between the actors' actions and the theme of the movie.The script puts very little meat on the bones for the actors to work with, and despite their considerable skills, they are all left playing versions of themselves in an endlessly fascinating digital world.The CGI is amazing, and the movie is fun in a very retrograde way, but the depth of the message is ultimately lost amid the renderings.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not the book but a great long-lasting fun movie.,"Right off the bat, i read the book and it was a real fun thing. Its IMPOSSIBLE to fill the details of this rich book into a movie. I was biased and expected the worst when i saw this book adaptaion the first time. Surprising to me, i really liked it. Ernest Cline co-wrote the screenplay which made sure that the overall story was still legit to the book. I hated the CGI in the beginning but you quickly get used to the style and makes sense as the story goes and you get sucked in. I have seen this movie three times now because its an easy story and promised fun to get sucked in like in old Spielberg classics. We know the stories, we have seen the films but we still watch them again and again. Funny enough, because of the book, this movie makes a lot of Spielberg references ans makes even more sense that none other than Spielberg directed this pop culture reference movie. Definetly a recommandation for an easy fun movie night.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"So messy and boring, very disappointed.","This is by far the messiest half and half human actors animated with cartoon characters film, so messy like a nightmare. What we got in this movie are randomly assembled figures, characters, scenes and settings from many many sci-fi and animation cartoon movies. It's like a cook who's gone crazy so he put all the overnight leftover with some newly cooked food and throws them into a big wok and pot, mixed them together without thinking. So when you eat the mixture, you just don't know what's what but you can see so clearly that most of the stuff scooped on your plate are things you've already disposed long time ago.This is a very hollow and childish film that might be only good for the teenagers or those who refuse to grow up or still live with their parents even they are already 30 or 40 years old. This is also the busiest film I've ever seen, but it's so hollow, so pointless, so formulaic and cliche'd, with poorly executed quite uninteresting scenarios and storyline. You just felt numb after it ended, you felt nothing, like a bystander watching a clueless farce.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
great action adventure after school special,"It's 2045. Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) is a 17 year old orphan living with his aunt in the trailer park stacks in Columbus, Ohio. The world is obsessed with the virtual reality world of OASIS and Wade spends most of his time there as his avatar Parzival. The late founder of OASIS, James Halliday (Mark Rylance), left his company shares worth half a trillion dollars to the winner of a contest he designed. The first to find an egg after retrieving three keys is set to control OASIS with his shares. After years of lack of success, Wade and his OASIS friend Aech are some of the remaining Gunters obsessed with solving the impossible game. They are opposed by corporate head of IOI and Halliday's former intern, Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), with his army of worker gamers called Sixers. As they continuously play the first challenge, Wade is joined by intriguing avatar Art3mis (Olivia Cooke).I'm not reading the book and I don't think it matters. There are some nagging issues with the underlying concepts. It's in need of a few tweaks. There are some greatness from master director Steven Spielberg but it is a flawed movie. There is no denying that it is a visually sensational action adventure. Spielberg's skills are superior although this movie is a bit of a modern references scattershot. Like Goro turning into Alien, it's a lot of recognizing familiar iconic images without it meaning anything. The only truly compelling reference is The Shining. The characters are allowed to spend time in the place and it ends with a compelling lesson. That's the only well written story arc. All the rest have some sort of flaws.The first test relies on a random quote from a lifetime with little overall meaning. It would be more likely to come across the solution by accident. After years of failure, somebody should be driving off the track. Just by a process of elimination, a Sixer would have driven in reverse once. As for Sorrento, he is both omnipotent and ruthless. He's willing to kill. He has massive computer power to track down anybody. After capturing Samantha, the obvious move for him is to torture her for information on Wade and all his friends. After killing one, killing more is no hurdle. It's like Sorrento's character arc went back a step. He needs to kill off the five and tension could be build by killing them one at a time. I was perplexed by Daito and Sho's first inclusion but at least, I thought that they would make good plot devices or at a minimum, cannon fodder. The last thing I thought that they would be useful is as a real world Scooby gang. As for Wade's speech to rally the OASIS world, it should have happened sooner right after IOI blow up the trailer park. I kept waiting for Wade to call in an avatar press conference where he exposes his real identity and IOI's murder spree. Also, there is Samantha's god-awful ugly face. Yah, right. It's played up so much and yet it's only a Gorbachev birthmark. It misses a big point about that issue. She could easily cover it up with heavy makeup. Another thing, is Sorrento's big evil plan about pop up ads? Recent developments at Facebook show what actual damage to the social order looks like. This is kiddie writing by comparison in imagining the worst case scenario. In many ways, that's the problem. This could have been a deeper social commentary but it is mostly trying to be a fun videogame story. The final lesson is to go out and smell the flowers. It is the easiest and cheesiest of after school special. That's the level of the script.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not bad, but not great","Visually, this movie was great. Spielberg and Co did a great job at making the Oasis come to life. Obviously some of the physical items had the animated edge to it, but that works because that is what the Oasis is all about!My issue lies in the plot itself. I didn't mind the changes from the original book plot - after all, watching video games and movies being played out is not exactly exciting on the screen. However, a lot of the characters major development arcs are cut out or significantly altered. Keeping spoilers to a minimum, Wade's brain wasn't there, and while that let Art3mis and Aech shine, it was eliminated their arcs as well. The plot just kind of kept walking, trudging through what could have been (and was in the book) an engrossing story, but spent more time on how pretty it all is. Halliday may have had something right - what we see on screens is great, but reality is still better.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not great compared to the book but still a good film,"So I just went and saw the film Ready Player One.
Having read the book, I hoped that a film might be made of it as it seemed like like an excellent story.
Then fairly recently I saw the advertisement for ready player one, which I recognised by the stacks and thought that it seemed similar to the the book. 
lo and behold it was in fact a film based on the book.
Unfortunately I must emphasize that it was a film based on the book rather than a film of the book because a lot of things were chopped out, things that I belive are the raw make-up of the story.I don't want to spoil the film for others so to be blunt I believe the film is only a shadow of the book both in story and in meaning.
I would still see the film as it is fun and interesting but if you were the kind of person that finds a story ruined to be very disappointing I wouldn't necessarily recommend seeing the film however if you have not read the book or do not mind a story change then the film is definitely worth a watch.
If the movie of the Last Airbender was a zero and Harry Potter was a 10, I would place this as an 8 on the scale of book to movie conversion.Unfortunately everything seems rushed despite large chunks of the story being omitted, a mini Love Story that locks at self-employed before the films even halfway through, a plot line that removes tragedies and replaces them with overly convenient situations simplified for the masses to be able to understand.
The book worked well because it had a lot of meaning that a geek or someone technical could understand and take pleasure in understanding but the film was spoon feeding.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why Disney keep doing this???,Steven Spielberg has clearly lost it. I used to be such a fan of his films but I have to admid his films are now dull and boring.This CGI style of movie is really sad.,,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
CGI dazzles but the movie's characters lack depth,"""Ready Player One"" (2018 release; 140 min.) brings the story of Wade. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Columbus, Ohio, 2045, The Stacks"", as we get to know Wade, a 17 year old living with his aunt. Wade, like many, spends a lot of time in a virtual reality world called the Oasis. In the Oasis Wade is known as Parzival. Before long, we learn that Halliday, the deceased co-creator of the Oasis, has left an Easter Egg hidden in the Oasis (and along with it, ownership of the Oasis and a half trillion dollars), which can be retrieved upon collecting three keys. The Oasis avatars are keen on finding the treasure, and that includes shady characters from IOI, a competitor of the Oasis. Who will find the Easter Egg? What becomes of Wade/Parzival? At this point we're 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: let me admit right upfront that if it weren't for the fact that this movie is directed by Steven Spielberg, I doubt that I would've gone to see it. Spielberg is perhaps the leading director of the last 40+ years, and I will always respect what he does/give him a chance. This is the big screen adaptation of the novel by Ernest Cline, which I have not read (and hence an in no position to comment how widely the movie diverges from the book--if at all). The movie is at its essence a nostalgic trip down into the 70s and 80s, when simple(r) computer games ruled (Atari, etc.). Long stretches of the movie play out entirely within the Oasis, and hence are purely CGI. And I'll admit it: these are at times dazzling, and always entertaining, sequences Check out the initial car race in Manhattan, with King Kong at the gatekeeper of the finish line. And with that, we are also on a treasure hunt of pop culture references, the likes of which I cannot recall having seen before. Sure, other movies have dabbled into that as well, but surely no movie has the sheer amount of them that ""Ready Player One"". I caught quite a few, but I'm sure there are tons of others that I simply didn't have the time to see. (Apparently the production team spent several years negotiating to get the licensing rights for all of these pop culture references.) My favorite sequence comes when Parzival and his friends find themselves in the setting of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" while looking for a clue to the next key. Sheer fun! However, once we are back in the real world, the movie suffers from poor character development. The movie's characters lack depth in every which way, and hence I have no emotional attachment or investment in any of them. In that sense, the movie is really just eye-candy, nothing more, nothing less, and I believe that a tighter edit of the movie (cutting its running time from the current excessively long 2 hrs. 20 min,) would've benefited the movie too. The movie features a ton of great music, both as to song placements (with lost of classic rock from the 70s and 80s) and the original score (courtesy of composer Alan Silvestri).""Ready Player One"" opened wide on Thursday (after previews on Wednesday evening). The Thursday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (but by no means sold out). As the end credits started rolling, the audience burst out in a spontaneous applause. Don't get me wrong: I liked ""Ready Player One"" for what it was, a nostalgic trip down into a simpler video gaming era, crammed with so many pop culture references that it will take several viewing to catch them all. But in the end, watching the movie is like watching a video game, literally. I encourage you to check out ""Ready Player One"", be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Does justice to the book,"The book is a love letter to the 1980s, filled with references and puns and that nostalgia for the time when ""it was all a game"". It would have been very difficult to capture it all in a movie, but this film managed to get the gist of it. If there was anything that I didn't quite like was the chemistry between Tye Sheridan and Olivia Cooke, which wasn't. Oh, and the ending... Tuesdays and Thursdays... right.Imagine a world where anything is possible and an epic quest for the keys to the kingdom. Complete it, and you will be the king. Lose and the villain will get to have it all and corrupt it after their own corporate image. A true hero's journey to find friendship, love and everything else. The perfect combination of 80's nostalgia and young adult movie. And directed by Spielberg, probably the only person who could convince all the rights holders to borrow their characters for this film that shows (briefly) King Kong, Jurassic Park, Mechagodzilla, The Iron Giant, Prince Goro, Alien, the Back to the Future DeLorean, Chucky, The Shining, Halo and so many others.Bottom line: it's not nearly as good as the book, but it does it justice.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Superficial entertainment by Spielberg.,"Ready Player One is based on the Ernest Cline novel of the same name, however the film adaptation is largely different to the original novel. In the year 2045, the world is a dystopia. There is no place for humanity to go, only the OASIS. The OASIS is a virtual reality video game that allows the player to create their own worlds and experience adventures of your deepest imagination. When the creator of the OASIS, Halliday (Mark Rylance) dies. He leaves behind three keys to secret easter egg which are hidden somewhere deep within the OASIS. Any player has the opportunity to find the easter egg and if they do, they inherit all of Halliday's riches and full control of the OASIS. One of the those players is Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), a down on his luck teenager who lives in a gigantic trailer park with his aunt. His opponents are the evil company known as IOI, run by the devilish Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). I was incredibly excited for Ready Player One. The trailers were fairly vague on the story and characters. However they showed off some amazing references and characters from the 1980s. I was hoping to see another gem in the realms of E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Raiders of the Lost Ark or Jurassic Park. I hoped that this film would bring back some of that Spielberg magic that I thought was missing in his latest films. I left the theatre satisfied but still yearning for more and not in a good way. The positives first, the action scenes in this film are amazing. They are incredibly thrilling and brought me back to my childhood memories in which the DeLorean from Back to the Future could go up against King Kong. Whenever action hit the screen, the film started to pick up and it was incredibly entertaining and thrilling. One segment in particular was fun, in which the main characters visit a famous film set (won't spoil which). The main story itself was also interesting, where Wade and his virtual friends delve deep into Halliday's life and backstory. Halliday even though his role is extremely limited was by far the best character of the whole film. The idea that perplexed him to create the OASIS is incredibly fascinating. However the rest of the characters really did let me down. Tye Sheridan is a very talented actor, however there are very little emotional grounds that his character Wade hits. I was extremely disappointed by that, a mid act twist really lost me and my connection with his character disappeared. The writing for his character was very basic and I was disappointed by that. Same thing can be said about Ben Mendelsohn as the villain. His character is very similar to Director Krennic from Rogue One. Mendelsohn is always great as a villain, however they are often underutilised and uninteresting. This is why I enjoyed so much in Darkest Hour as he really played against character. The rest of the cast also feels a bit generic and mediocre. The themes feel a little hamfisted (particularly through Mendelsohn). I enjoyed many aspects of Ready Player One, the special effects are simply incredible. One of Spielberg's best looking movies. The score by Alan Silvestri added adrenaline to the story and felt right at home with the subject matter. I thought the story was interesting, but it felt a little thin as I guess Spielberg and the screenwriters wanted to make room for more movie / game references. The characters are underutilised especially Wade Watts. I would definitely recommend a viewing for fans of movies and video games. This can be incredibly entertaining on a superficial surface level viewing. A overall fun and thrilling adventure that could've used some better writing and characters but one I can certainly see myself watching again.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very different from the book but very fun movie,"Full disclosure, when I saw the movie in the cinema the first time (actually the first two times) I hadn't read the book.

That being said, I think actually I prefer the film!I'm glad I hadn't seen any of the promo posters (other than the main one with the whole cast) or much of the trailers, which I'd say avoid (along with looking at the cast list), unless you want a couple of surprises spoilt.It's fun, fast-paced and exciting, and I was immediately won over by the 80s music on the soundtrack.

In the book, the story is driven by visual detail that celebrates a distinctive period in pop culture that was largely defined by the director; it was ready made to be turned into a movie that should and easily could have been far better than the book. What a sorry twist that such a poorly written book was turned into such a poorly directed movie. Maybe the licensing was just that impossible?

Joyful spot-the-reference adventure.,"It has been ten years since Spielberg last went full blockbuster (Indiana Jones 4) - his effort in the last decade predominantly spent on Oscar-bait historical dramas - so it's a delight to see him back in gleeful popcorn mode. Set in Columbus, Ohio circa 2045, this pop-culture adventure follows the pure-of-heart Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) as he searches for the ultimate digital Easter Egg within the OASIS, a virtual world that has all but replaced the real one. Adapted from Ernest Cline's cult-classic novel of the same name, the script is a labyrinth of references to movies and video games that progresses at such a fast pace there's barely a chance to realise just how banal the follow-the-clues plot actually is. There are so many winks and nods it's impossible to catch them all on a first viewing, but the standout by miles is a lengthy sequence that pays homage to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining. It's completely unexpected, but remarkably funny in a heartfelt way. The opening set piece is an exhilarating car race with crazy injects (T-Rex! King Kong!), however the action slowly decreases in excitement until a climactic battle that is disappointingly uninventive, save for the fact that we see Disney's Iron Giant in combat. The visualisation of the OASIS is a tad off-putting too, the in-movie virtual world consisting of almost-photorealistic characters who occasionally suffer from the uncanny valley effect. Some may argue this is intentional, but it's distracting nevertheless. This isn't close to reaching top-tier blockbuster-Spielberg, and at 140 minutes is waaaay too long, but Ready Player One is a joyful spot-the-reference romp that offers up enough to put a smile on your face.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A fitting revival of the virtual world movie,"There has been many movies about virtual reality, the most obvious place to start would be Tron. I started my teenage years in 1980, so I was literally there for all of the attempts to make film and TV ""virtual world"" material, and yes, I saw Tron on its first release. There have been many since then, Tron laying the ground for the TV series and films that came from there on. Most of them never really hit the spot, they were either too much of a clone of Tron, or too far from the virtual reality world to be classed in it's league. Whatever the case, they were largely poor imitations of the grandaddy of all of them. Ready Player One breaks that mould, a fitting tribute to the original idea, referencing many if the greatest movies of all time within the story which adds to the fun and effortlessly breaking away form the virtual reality to anchor you to the real world action. I don't often give 10/10, but this really does deserve it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Potential without full effect,"Ok, so no film can truly live up to its source material and should be judged on its own basis. That said, this movie inspired by the book of the same name has all of the fun pop culture references, special effects, and future tech to be a really fun movie. But it fell flat for me in execution of its ""plot"" . The future never seemed as dystopian or bleak, which in turn made there less distance for the heroine to emerge from. Character development felt rushed and confusing. (Why do I like these characters?) Even a cursory following of the source material would have provided a solid path for the film to build on. I guess it's par the course for most blockbusters, but it didn't have to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ready Player One (2018),"Lets face it, Steven Spielberg has been streaky in the past few years. I absolutely love some of his earlier stuff. Jaws, Jurassic Park, E.T., are just some of the titles that I love from him. Even some of the work from the 90's like Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan are excellent. I did like his last effort (The Post) which was a solid politically based news drama. I wasn't overly impressed with the marketing or trailers for Ready Player One, but Spielberg's name being attached meant I was curious. At the very least I expected to ride that nostalgia wave that I feel a lot of others wanted to experience as well.The film is set in the year 2045. The world is vastly different and everyone is immersed in a virtual world named the OASIS. The protagonist Wade uses his virtual character and enlists the help of a team to find a hidden easter egg in the OASIS. The creator of the OASIS has hidden three keys that lead to the egg and the one who completes the challenges to earn the egg will take over the creator's fortune and also control the virtual reality world. The CEO of a corporation named IOI is attempting to gain control of the egg himself, thwarting Wade's quest.This has to be one of Steven Spielberg's most ambitious and toughest films to make. The film is heavily computer animated as expected, and there is so much on screen. There are plenty of references to pop culture of the past. You will see movie and video game references everywhere; you are bound to miss many of them because some come and go quick. Licensing to use these characters must have been hell but it was done nonetheless. Visually the film is nice, some of the computer animation might be distracting but its still fun to look at.I do think the film is overlong and drags quite a bit in the third act. I know the film is following a literary work so its hard to criticize some of the plot holes or advancement of the plot. I don't feel like the side characters were as fleshed out as they could have been. The film gets too busy making references and delivering action that it kind of loses its heart. I did however really enjoy the entire segment with The Shining, fairly brilliant stuff.I was also disappointed with the soundtrack. I wanted more 80s nostalgia in term of music. For example, some of the songs used in the trailers could have been utilized but isn't done so. The film isn't always smart and some of the pop culture references feel ham fisted and tacked on but I feel like the film was better than I thought it would be. I'm actually pretty infatuated with Olivia Cooke at the moment. She's quite a talented actress having recently seen her in Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, and Thoroughbreds. I want to see her in everything.This film isn't touching some of Steven Spielberg's very best but its a better film than what we've been seeing recently from the filmmaker. its certainly a better film than The BFG and War Horse. Overall, visually it provides actions and a lot of references but suffers a bit as the film wears on. Still, its an entertaining watch, which is really all I was asking for from Ready Player One.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Has Spielberg lost all his marbles?,"Or another greedy and nasty wife took over while keeping him in induced coma? Happened to him before :-) so I'm not kidding at all.Remember how people were spitting on Michael bay over the ""Transformers"" ? Well, he turned out to be a total artist compared this - don't know even how to name it. His game-like sequences had actual purpose and integral place in the story (which did always exist, despite delusional naysayers).This thing is one colossal nothing in comparison. When I want a video game a fire up an Xbox. If something is declared to be a movie I expect a movie - not a copy of someone's YT recording.Someone please help wake up Spielberg from that coma repo his wife is keeping him in. Pretty please :-)I stumbled upon this just by looking around to see what else has Hannah Kamen done (quite legendary ""killjoy""). Shouldn't have clicked on it, but what can you do when your mice gets faster than your neo-cortex ?

Ready Player One lacks a solid story but excels as pure escapism at the movies.,"Breaking the post Oscars lull is Spielberg's Ready Player One, a Sci-fi action-adventure throwback to not only the golden 80s of cinema, but also popular video games and music of that era. In fact, there are so many references in rapid succession that if you blink, you'd miss a few. That's not saying the film is perfect. For a project assembled with layer after layer of pop culture references, including the movie magic of Spielberg's yesteryears, Ready Player One lacks a solid story. Also, what should be a thoroughly nostalgic experience at the cinema is overladen with visual effects just because the studio (own Amblin Entertainment) can afford it.Still reading? Good, because despite some blaring faults, the film is still watchable thanks to a few terrific moments that hold everything together. Now imagine stepping into a virtual world where you can be whoever you want to be. Thanks to our current and rising addiction to social media forums, the film predicts that by 2045 much of humanity will live in isolation but connected through virtual reality. Called the OASIS and linked in via VR headsets, anyone can do pretty much what they want, and accordingly reap benefits or face the consequences. Staying alive and rising to the top of the leaderboards often require expensive power-ups and upgrades in both the OASIS and the real world. Which is where we meet Wade Watts, the underprivileged teen protagonist who dreams of winning the ultimate prize - a glowing Easter egg that comes with immense fame and fortune in both worlds. But getting there is the ultimate challenge, especially when Wade has to compete with villainous corporations in addition to the A-Team, King Kong, T-Rex, Freddy Krueger and Lara Croft to name just a few. 
 
With the Easter break round the corner, Ready Player One is perfectly placed as an understated pun in itself. But in blaring its trumpet, the film tries to be the mother goose of golden Easter eggs with references to several cinematic 'events', the pinnacle of which is a fantastic tribute to a classic horror film. It's gets heavy handed from there, and because we are looking at photorealistic CGI characters, the film turns out to be more animation (albeit in ultra-high definition) than live action. While that's not such a bad thing, watching this for nearly the entire length of the film can get rather tedious. The teen romance that begins to take shape midway doesn't help either and neither is it required.Yet among all the frantic action and chaos, Ready Player One has a nuanced message about the disintegration of society and everything that's joyful about real human feelings. As Mark Rylance's James Halliday, founder of the OASIS puts it, ""As painful as reality is, it's the only place you'll get a good meal"". That's an insignificant line in the film if you don't stop and understand what it means. Ponder a bit and it's clear that we wouldn't need any form of escapism if we were all living in a perfect world. But reality bites. We know it and that's why we invented escapism. The movies have always been an escape, and despite the lack of any relatable character, the film more than makes up with social commentary that stings. The fact that the film is set in the future but made to look like the past only cements the notion that while the future is blank, the past has many fond memories we can always escape to. Without really trying hard, that's all this film tries to be. And who better than fanboy number-one to take us back, to the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fun, but missing a bit of heart","'Ready Player One' is based on the 2011 book by Ernest Cline (he co-writes the screenplay here), and as with all novel-to-film adaptions, the movie's not quite as good. Ironically, it feels like there's more action in the book! That being said, this is still a Spielberg sci-fi epic, with plenty to see and experience. It's a conglomeration of 'The Matrix' and 'Avatar', with people in 2045 essentially living their lives in a virtual reality world (the ""Oasis""), created by Halliday (Rylance) & Morrow (Pegg).Wade (Sheridan) is the unlikely hero, trying to win the 'game', which is a mix of 80s/90s video games and other TV/film references/characters - you could spend the whole movie glimpsing/placing cool things: 'Back To The Future', Gundam, Halo, Ninja Turtles, Iron Giant, Tron, etc. This is fun, but often makes it feel like quantity over quality. Has some good songs, but I would've liked more. Helping Wade against the evil Sixers/IOI, led by Sorrento (Mendelsohn) is Artemis (Cooke) and Aech (Waithe) - with Sho (Zhao) and Daito (Morisaki) thrown in near the end for good measure. There's not much character development and it's hard to care too much when they spend most of their time as cartoonish avatars in the Oasis.Plenty can be inferred from this bleak future, where everyone is disconnected from reality and humanity, instead spending all their time online - pros and cons both ways. The ending is satisfactory, but I feel like we needed more time in the real world, especially with the secondary characters, especially Pegg and TJ Miller. It does differ from the book in a few areas, but it is great to see a lot of it realised on the big screen - the battle at the end is quite spectacular and the car races suitably chaotic. It's good, without being exceptional.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A well put-together, but casually terrible piece of work","So. I'll say this much. Looked at purely on a surface level, this is a pretty okay modern action blockbuster. Spielberg knows how to put these things together in a way that's entertaining. It only really drags during one insanely overdone endless battle sequence.All the same, I really don't like this, for a handful of somewhat interrelated reasons:The story of this thing is really just ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" with technical bells and whistles and an endless stream of pop culture references. That isn't necessarily a problem. The elements grafted onto the familiar story could add some thematic resonance absent in the original story. They don't.I don't buy this film's virtual world. To be clear, I'm not griping about whether it's technically possible. Clearly it's not by modern standards, but maybe it will be some day, but I don't think a story like this is obligated to stay inside the realm of technical possibility anyway.What I don't accept is that this is a world that people would spend time in and that it would make it's creator rich. Setting aside all the superficial wish fulfillment elements the film throws at you constantly, what I see is a world where there's a constant threat of not just death, but effectively perma-death, even if you're just sitting in a dance club or something. What I really see in most of this film's big sequences is a frenetic, unplayable mess that would constantly be throwing away even the smallest amount of progress anyone made.Why do I harp on this? Because I don't think that the movie has any interest in actually engaging with it's setting. There's no thought of what anyone is actually getting out of this world. There's no consideration of how anything is monetized, so how owning it could be worth anything. There's no real thought put into why Ben Mendelsohn would be the villain here aside from the fact that he's ... oh no ... corporate and played by Ben Mendelsohn. The worst thing that the people can think of Mendelsohn doing is putting ads in the game ... you know, attempting to monetize nostalgia??? (The irony has escaped them I guess)The film's biggest sin is not attempting to engage with why any of this nostalgia might matter to anyone. It vaguely suggests that perhaps it's more than a little sad the sum total of Mark Rylance's existence reduces to some 80's movies and some vintage video games, but all of these suggestions are thrown away pretty quickly because they'd really highlight that this film has nothing to say about what role these things may have actually played in his life. It ultimately just retreats to the mild admonition that maybe you should get out more, but you know ... after you've bought all the stuff this film has thrown at the screen.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Spielberg makes an exciting call home again.,"Steven Spielberg's world has always been virtual realities of adventure and nostalgia, from King Kong and T Rex toIndiana Jones and ET to Close Encounters. Once again in Ready Player One he goes adventure- fantastical into the gamers' world of the virtual where a hunt for an egg can be Easter's annual hunt or a serious search for happiness among goggles and graft. This film is solid Spielberg, not great Spielberg but with enough pop-cult allusions to please even the most fervid geek.Young Parzival (Tye Sheridan) is the likeliest gamer to discover the three keys that will win the Easter egg and the vast Oasis empire, which has enslaved the world to games, and my Columbus, Ohio, in 2045. More like ""mesmerized"" because the world of trash and piled-high trailers or ""stacks"" is what the virtual gamers like him are hoping to escape.No need for me, at least, to see how our civilization, and my precious city, is in danger of enslavement by smart phones. Just look anywhere in public to see the absorption technology engenders to the exclusion of old-fashioned socializing.Recently I was a visiting professor at a high-end college classroom. As I walked in 10 minutes before class, every one of the 13 students was on a smart phone. Very depressing image about a time I used to cherish as an undergrad to gossip and schmooze face to face.It's not difficult to figure out Spielberg's game of warning us all about our consuming games and more universally, smart phones. Yet that acclaimed director keeps his childlike fascination with the complexities of family and love, as Tye, like us, finds there's no place like the home and love, the latter the most real place on earth. Although the film misses the intimacy and poetry of his greatest hits, it provides enough adventure and sentiment to please the general public.Great director Spielberg can dazzle with graphics lovely to behold and still juxtapose those fantasies with real world shenanigans, bad guys and all. You'll want to find a zero-gravity dance hall right after the movie; Spielbergean sentiment will have you do it with your best love, not some virtual fantasy.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Fun!,"Based on Cline's 2011 novel of the same name, Steven Spielberg's 'Ready Player One' is a fun watch, that sees the versatile director flex his talent for a summer blockbuster yet again. Although largely imperfect, this bid-budgeted Sci-Fi Adventure is never out of breath or visual bedazzlement.'Ready Player One' Synopsis: When the creator of a virtual reality world called the OASIS dies, he releases a video in which he challenges all OASIS users to find his Easter Egg, which will give the finder his fortune.'Ready Player One' is about video gamers & I'm certain video gamers are sure to enjoy this ride. The story here is basic, with an earnest protagonist (Tye Sheridan) who must fight against an evil villain (Ben Mendelsohn, in fine form). But, Spielberg is up for the challenge & he delivers entertaining sequences. I'd like to single out the sequence involving the Stanley Kubrick Horror Classic ""The Shining"". Its truly a terrific sequence, that captures both, humor & rush. Also, the visuals are to die for. 'Ready Player One' is a pure visual dream.Now coming to the flaws, the biggest problem with 'Ready Player One' is that it lacks soul. While its definitely a fun watch, this story lacks soul and also hardly has any characters that you actually feel for. And thats where the Writing lacks the bite. It goes all-out in imagery & action, but its out of considerable depth. Its all great to look at it, but there isn't any genuine emotion here to feel.And yet, 'Ready Player One' isn't low on its marks. Its very much, a watchable & at times, hilarious film, that delivers a bang for your buck. Screenplay by Zak Penn & Ernest Cline is up for the bets, but lack of emotional depth take away some of its glory. Spielberg's Direction, as always, is well-done. I mean, he just gave us the terrific 'The Post' 3 months ago & now a popcorn entertainer with 'Ready Player One'. Now that's range! Janusz Kaminski's Cinematography is top-notch, as ever. 
Michael Kahn & Sarah Broshar's Editing is finely done. Alan Silvestri's Score is lovely. And oh that nostalgia of the 80's music! Art & Costume Design are perfect.Performance-Wise: Tye Sheridan shines in the leading-role. The actor brings a certain likability to the part & stays committed throughout. Olivia Cooke is a Stunning leading-lady & a delight to watch. Lena Waithe has her moments. T.J. Miller is very funny. Simon Pegg is decent. But its Mark Rylance as the deceased creator of the OASIS, who steals the show.On the whole, 'Ready Player One' is imperfect, but never not worth watching. Go in and have fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Another potential classic wasted,"I never knew steven spielberg though i watched most of his movies and i was amazed to know that he directed saving private ryan (one of the classic war movies).

I felt that mostly everything in Ready player one had no purpose or message and it was just another show of visuals or action scenes( which were splendid by the way)
There was no meaning to the format of the tournament. No meaning to kira's character. No meaning to the rebellion. and much much more. I kept waiting for a moral or transformation but all i found was a bad ending and dissapointment.
the movie had absolutely no character development and below average dialogue. It makes me sad that a book rated 4.3/5 became such a movie.

Classic Spielberg,A world within a world. Haven't we seen that somewhere from Christopher Nolan or even Disney's Wreck it Ralph? It may not be an original idea on the surface but the execution of it is very original. Packed to the rafters with nostalgic cameos for viewers of varying age groups. The creator of a virtual world leaves behind in the event of his death an Easter egg hidden within his digital world that contains the rights to the hosting company lock stock and barrel. Users of this world have competed with each other and a corporation to discover the whereabouts of these hidden secrets and the pot of gold that awaits to become the owner of the worlds largest company. In a battle of morals versus corporate greed Spielberg is at his very best with lavish special effects that conversely are clearly CGI effects rather than striving to hide the seem between reality and computer generated.

"Imaginative and fun, though lacks an emotional core","In the grand scheme of blockbuster filmmaking, you could definitely do worse than Ready Player One. It boasts plenty of style, imagination, and dazzling visuals and Spielberg lends his experienced hand to stitch everything together in kinetic fashion. It's worth a recommendation on the strength of its best set pieces and its sheer exuberance. On the other hand, the movie also feels somewhat ungrounded and overblown. Its glaring issue is that the characters largely fail to anchor the movie and give it the emotional core that it needs. They're serviceable, but lacking in depth nearly across the board and the lead, in particular, does not carry the film too well. It also suffers a bit from the Speilberg schmaltz factor, mainly in its resolution. Still, it's a fun, mostly well-directed film that stands out in a sea of generic blockbusters.3.5/5",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brilliant 80s nostalgia with relevant social message,"I left this movie feeling an incredible glow I haven't felt in ages. On the one hand the movie is jam packed with references to classic 1980s TV shows, computer games and movies, while it also has some very meaningful social commentary about the dangers of escapist entertainment relevant to the social media obsessed world of today. It is rare to find a movie that so seamlessly integrates the past with the future. Add to this was great characterisation, a well rounded and intriguing story and some satisfying special effects, it is hard to imagine how the movie could be any better. Also worth mentioning is how well it balances a love story with plenty of high energy action sequences. It has clearly been made with tremendous respect for the book and the 1980 source material it references.

More than meets the eye,"In the seventies, women were into sharp-dressed revolutioners. In the eighties, athletic types became more and more popular. Throughout the nineties, ideals became more material and people with beautiful and fast cars would attract people. Nowadays, geeks are all the rage. Twenty years ago, those people were outsiders because of their chubby features, big glasses and strange beards and because they spend most of their free time in front of their consoles in their parents' basement, wearing Mario Bros. shirts and drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos. Today, these outsiders have become trendy because of their chubby features, big glasses and strange beards and because they spend most of their free time in front of their consoles in their parents' basement, wearing Mario Bros. shirts and drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos. Sometimes, this world is a strange place. In order to understand more about this stereotype and pimp my trendy knowledge, I decided to give Ready Player One a shot.I didn't expect much but got a very rewarding surprise. Ready Player One avoids stereotypes as opposed to my somewhat exaggerated yet quite accurate introduction. This movie could have focused on great-looking main characters who are destined for each other. But this isn't Divergent. The movie could have been overacted with overtly dramatic emotional ups and downs portraying immature teenagers. But this isn't The Hunger Games. The movie could have overwhelmed us with eye candy in form of massive flashy special effects without any depth. But this isn't Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. The film could have had a quite emotionless plot without any interest set in a stereotypical dystopian world. But this isn't Ghost in the Shell. The movie could have felt quite stretched with its ambitious running time of one hundred forty minutes and included vapid lows throughout the middle section. But this isn't Blade Runner 2049.Ready Player One is better than all the movies mentioned before. The two main characters are grounded and sympathetic which makes their love story surprisingly credible and emotional. The acting performances are balanced as the characters are sometimes overwhelmed by emotions but often have to use their intellect to solve problems. The only moment when the movie overwhelms us with flashy colours is in the first five minutes to briefly introduce the virtual reality of OASIS but the rest of the movie doses special effects very well as the movie balances calm and intellectual moments with dramatic and vivid passages. The plot centered around a massive treasure chase might not be revolutionary but includes numerous clever references to pop culture of which I particularly liked the setting of The Shining, the nod to Mechagodizilla and the allusions to progressive rock veterans Rush. Moreover, the movie has several interesting messages such as the fact that nothing is as magic as our own reality. I also liked the side characters, especially the unique inventor of OASIS who reminds me of a mixture of Olaf Schubert and Tommy Wiseau. Finally, the movie didn't waste one single minute and was entertaining from start to finish thanks to an already interesting novel this movie was based upon, outstanding scriptwriting efforts and very solid directional work.In the end, I can only recommend watching this movie at your local theater. You don't need a distracting, expensive and headache-inducing 3D version at Cineplex though, just go along with the old school 2D version in your small local cinema. It would suit the message and intention behind the novel and film much better. Now I can realate much more to geeks with their chubby features, big glasses and strange beards who spend most of their free time in front of their consoles in their parents' basement, wearing Mario Bros. shirts and drinking Mountain Dew and eating Cheetos.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An Easer Egg of Easter Eggs - A Wonderful Movie,"When I originally saw this as a ""pre-production"" title and that it was going to be made by Spielberg, I knew I had to see it. Upon watching it, I was not disappointed. Now, as with every movie, there were some downsides. The classical hero who meets the love of his life and they become boyfriend/girlfriend is definitely one of my top groaners in movies. It is so typical and many, many movies are developed around that scenario. That being said, this movie had so much more in it than that.We can start with the references. Not only do I like to watch movies to find their references to other works of production, but I love to see what Easter eggs get planted. With this movie being about an Easter egg planted in an ultra-VR setting, I absolutely went nuts finding references and eggs. To name a few references: Doctor Who, Star Wars, Godzilla, Zootopia, just to name a few. There are truly hundreds of references and nods to other movies hidden throughout this feature film. I know I haven't noticed or picked out all of them, but I sure do enjoy doing it.My favorite thing about this movie was all the real-world video game truth about it. Today, you see both kids and adults playing games online for real money. Not only does this film portray a dystopian future, but I think it portrays a future that is not too far away and not too far off from reality. There is also some video game history thrown in here. Both old and new games are played and referenced throughout the movie.
The reference to the game Adventure which contained the world's first hidden feature, which coined the term ""Easter egg"" was a huge plus for me. As a young kid, I remember watching other people play these games or hear them talk about them. I never did play them, but I know the classics were some of the best games ever made.Overall, I really enjoyed this film. I especially enjoyed one of the main points behind it. ""Reality is what is real."" This sentence I hope wakes people out of their addictive online gaming habits and brings them back to the real world. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy references and Easter eggs. There's just so many. Again, great movie, highly recommended, and hope for another just as good someday soon!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg returns but like before?,"The most spectacular Spielberg (Indiana Jones or Jurassic Park) returns filming and narrating masterfully.
Although there are many problems that I can give you, it is the abuse of references to popular culture, which should be in the background, which bothers me the most.
A functional casting in the worst sense, with a protagonist is anti-charismatic.
I should delve deeper into the themes proposed by the film because as it is proposed is simple and flat, sending an almost toxic message about the world of videogames. You should leave so much nostalgia and tell a decent story.
Anyway, it's a good movie with its pluses and minuses.

Hits and misses....from a failed matrix clone.,"This was a very long animated mostly action videogame flick which could have been a lot better but instead due to the lack of an actual plot failed big time.
 u can say this was a failed matric clone.

 Yes....even Charles lee ray made an appearance in this mess.on the positives the music was great if u are in your....50s......40s.........and the visual effects were great BUT it suffered from long animation videogame action scenes.all in all a weird movie which had it's moments but it will never be a classic and it will be forgotten in time.GRADE // C (cause I love the 80s music)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just Fantastic!,"I watched this movie expecting to be very disappointed. What a surprise to find i was totally delighted and enthralled after less than 20 minutes!
This is Spielberg at his best. The story, the visuals, the cast, the wonder, the magic...
I loved all the pop culture references and almost whooped and punched the air when The Iron Giant appeared! Then there's the Dolorian, Godzilla, The Overlook Hotel sequence, Robocop, Alien, even ""f*****g Chucky"" and sooooo much more.
This nostalgia has been criticised by some reviewers, but trust me it's totally relevant to the virtual world that has been envisioned in this movie. And what's so wrong with a bit of nostalgia anyway!
This is a completely thrilling movie. A shining example of how a popcorn movie should be. The actors performances are perfect in the roles they play, particularly Tye Sheridan & Olivia Cooke.
There is also a warning to all game players out there for a very possible future. As wonderful as Virtual Reality may seem - it's not REAL - so be careful what you wish for!

"Visual masterpiece, albeit very formulaic","This is by far one of the most impressive spectacles I've ever seen, the level of detail in the animation was honestly fantastic. It also takes place in what is more realistic of a future than it seems on the surface, as the future of entertainment will be enhanced immersion, and ultimately sugarcoat the overly complicated world.The Harry Potter-esque game is thematically brilliant, and adds gravity to the main questline, where we were introduced to the main character's love interest, which started with the badass girlboss trope, and unfortunately followed the other trope of manic pixie dream girl, both of which obvious to experienced viewers. There were other strange cliches throughout the film, from comically stupid bad guys to ""diverse group of heroes equally win"", which has been done a million times before. Additionally, they were not very creative with how the first key was found if you apply critical thought to the series of events, as it's completely unrealistic that nobody would drive backwards. In general the movie doesn't take into account how many people there are in the world, and will be by 2045, though they really nailed the eSports predatory competitive gaming organizations, adware, and as discussed prior, the possible future of video games.The confines of PG-13 made points in the movie incredibly awkward, such as the sexual scenes where they neither went all in nor held back. Likewise other parts of the movie can't decide if this is a dystopian sci-fi or if real life is truly cartoonish. This again goes back to the lack of focus, likely due to chain of command and many writers, and the overall push towards broad appeal causing it to be more like a case study on the psychology of entertainment rather than the inspiration of a single writer's universe.So, despite it having some of the best CGI you will ever witness, it is unlikely to leave a lasting impression or create fans out of most who watch it, simply because it is a product meant to be consumed above all else; the equivalent of asking Chat GPT to write you an easily liked movie script.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Fun, dumb and more fun! It may look like a kids movie but if I'm honest, unless you're over 30 and have played a lot of video games in your day, this movie may not be for you. I however, fit that category. I thought it was unique, exciting and great fun. I wouldn't care if I never saw it again but I still enjoyed myself. There were some eye rolls here and there story wise, but in Spielberg fashion, the acting and directing was great. Mark Rylance and Ben Mendelsohn killed it. So good. The main hero characters could have been recast in my opinion. They were good but nothing special. Now the Visual Effects were insanely amazing. An impressive visual spectacle with movie and video game references galore. And I mean GALORE. Like almost too much haha! Sound design of Spielberg's team was flawless and impressive yet again. Music was good but not great. Not too many memorable themes but still helped tell the story. Oh and one more thing I have to mention, the fight choreography and how it was shot was amazing! Wasn't too much of it but it was noticeably great. Compared to say, Black Panther where is was choppy editing and CGI cartoon feel.

It was only at the end that I realised the reason for my lack of satisfaction - it's a kids' film. Packed with fast-paced action, massive, noisy set-pieces, giant robots and gibbering jargon it assaults the senses almost without a pause, but sadly the story is wafer-thin and there's little of the superb 'family feeling' that we normally see in Spielberg movies.
There are a few good references to older films and classic computer games but let's face it, anyone can do that. So, impressive as the spectacle is (the CGI is quite something), ultimately for me it is a 'one time only' movie, never to be watched again.

Kids will enjoy it,"Ready Player One is pretty much all style, no substance. The graphics and set pieces are incredible while the actual story, themes, and world building are below average (I haven't read the book). Overall, it's a solid kid's movie but fails to elevate beyond that.For positives - the animated scenes / set pieces were truly great (worth seeing for these alone) and in my opinion the heavy reliance on pop culture franchise references ended up being more endearing than groan-worthy (although it straddles the line at times). To be honest it was pretty fun trying see how many references we could identify.On the negative side - pretty much everything else is subpar:The storyline and world building suffer from massive and obvious holes (fatal for a sci-fi property)The ""real world"" scenes are mostly terrible - fueled by both bad acting and the most glaring plot holes being related to the real world side of the movie. In addition the failure to think through major pieces of the story / world undermines the movie's (in my opinion vapid and borderline nonsensical) attempt at critiquing capitalismI found the movie unsuccessful in resolving its main theme (""live in the real world""). The characters still seem to essentially derive all their life meaning from video games and pop culture, which is quite sad.My recommendation if you're looking for something with actual substance is to follow Superman's instructions from the movie and pick-up a copy of War & Peace.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not only for gaming geeks,"I've been a collector of retro video gaming for a long time now so I couldn't be more pleased with this movie where it's filled with references to that era. It's like being brought back to the eighties but then in the future, very strange. Strange but good because Ready Player One is a very entertaining movie and it's well made. Going back and forth from the real world to the virtual world, it all worked smoothly. The story isn't even far fetched as you see how it is now, with most people addicted to their gadgets. I can see this future happening. The cast in the real world was good even though they don't play the major parts. The major parts are mostly virtual and are inside the game. It reminded me a bit of Tron, a movie that blew my mind away when I was a kid. But Ready Player One is so much better, so if you're a fan of that kinda of stories you will like this movie. The fictional characters are legion and even if you're not a gaming geek I'm sure you will recognize some. Steven Spielberg did another good job coming with a totally different movie again.

A fun ride* (asterisk = but it could have been better),"This book was basically a giant (and entertaining) adventure in nostalgia. And the film was fairly similar. Of course, the book was better. And I do not say that because they changed things (you have to) or because books are usually better (they are). The issue here: the book fades over the second half when the conceptual novelty wears off...the film starts so fast that it fails to establish the characters all that well in the first place. So while the adventure is fun and the references are great, that lack of exposition leaves you caring less as the story goes on. The concept was still inventive and the story still worked, but the stakes would have been higher with more complex characters and more developed relationships. Also, Cline's preachiness in the hands of Spielberg leads to this movie trying just a BIT too hard at points. Shocking, right?

Spielberg plays a VR game,"It's been a while since Steven Spielberg's last meeting with the science fiction genre. After directing a version of 'War of the Worlds' in 2005 with Tom Cruise in the lead role, a film that I liked but was kind of 'destroyed' by critics, Spielberg seemed to have broken away from science fiction, at least as director. The comeback took place recently, in 2018, and Spielberg seems to want to prove with 'Ready Player One' that he manages to keep abreast of some of the most advanced achievements in gaming and virtual reality technologies, while going back to the cultural roots of his generation, to the early period of the data screens culture, the '70s and' 80s that paved the way for today's and probably tomorrow's visual culture. Spielberg used to divide his productions into 'films' and 'movies'. The latter are more immersive experiences, for the pursuit of which it is good to supply ourselves, as spectators, with large portions of popcorn. 'Ready Player One' belongs to the latter category.The story takes place in 2045 in a somewhat post-apocalyptic world, in which a large part of the planet's inhabitants escape the desolate reality around them by plunging into a virtual world, in which each earthling has an avatar through which he/she lives his.her parallel life. The creator of this world, played by Mark Rylance (returning in a Spielberg film after the formidable role in 'Bridge of Spies') leaves at his death to mankind, as the ancient oracle, a test that allows the one who solves three problems to master the virtual universe for better or worst. Spielberg creates a film in which fans of virtual reality games will feel in a familiar world but in which also find their place characters from comics or retro games. The heroes are children and teenagers, the favorite heroes of a filmmaker who aspires to a permanent age of innocence but also of questions, the courage to fight for what is right and the curiosity to explore and expand the limits of knowledge. Spielberg's mastery lies in the fact that he manages to convey an optimistic message and guide his young and very young actors in an interesting cinematic way, avoiding what I call the 'Disneyzation'.We witness as spectators 140 minutes of continuous action, which will satisfy the fans of action movies and will generate, I believe, quite a lot of toys, gadgets, and sets for the future rides in theme parks. The story, based on a novel by Ernest Cline, is not terribly original but is enriched with elements of mythology and sprinkled with references from the history of video and computer games that will be enjoyed by those who were kids in the '70s or' 80. It is obvious that Steven Spielberg also joyfully immersed himself in the production, creating a visual experience influenced by VR, action games and comic book characters. The more serious message of 'Ready Player One' would be related to the parallelism and interaction between the real and virtual worlds, an interaction that takes place in the mind and soul of each of us. Anyone who has had a VR experience knows that even physiologically you need a few seconds, sometimes more time to readjust to reality. But what if VR is no longer just a game, but an alternative to real life on a planet that has become almost uninhabitable, and if it is extended to society as a whole? Spielberg avoids answering these questions with the tools - still essentially escapist - of action movies. So let us take our popcorn and enjoy this 'movie'. The more serious questions remain unanswered, and perhaps they will be addressed in his future films.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The clumsy exposition scenes really grated with me; it's a bit of a pet peeve of mine, but Spielberg usually manages to make them a little less obvious than they are here.
It honestly felt like I was watching a run-of-the-mill 80s action flick at times, the number of times I moaned 'of course', 'obviously' or 'really??' at the screen.Having said all the above, the CGI was excellent and the premise fairly engaging (if ultimately a little childish) which, on balance, dragged the whole affair to just above average for me.Grab some macaroni to go with the chees, or butter for the corn if you're going to watch.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

150 minutes watching people play computer games. Seriously.,"What's the point in leaving a review when there are already a couple of thousand out there? Well, this has a very high rating, I guess most of those reviews are positive, and I'd like to register a little warning for anyone looking for one.In a grim future dominated by a single online game, the game's creator has hidden a huge real-world prize, with clues to find it. That idea is good, but nothing else is, and even this brings a problem, placing all the action inside the game - there are hardly any real-world scenes. Therefore the viewer spends 2.5 precious hours watching other people play computer games in which the worst that can happen is 'game over'. Serious gamers would surely sooner be playing than watching this.There are references to gaming history, but far more to film and other aspects of pop culture, most of them very dated, and possibly tedious for younger viewers. OK, we all know Millennium Falcon, but how many people know what 'Valley Forge from Silent Running' is?So what's so bad? Everything. There's no plot beyond the idea itself. It's way way too long for something with no plot. The characters are boring, partly because the acting is poor across the board, especially bad-guy Ben Mendelsohn who sleepwalks through. The original score is horrible, loud and intrusive. The dialogue is flat, dull and rarely funny. The direction is patchy with long sequences of sheer tedium. The FX, which dominate the movie, are same old same old, with nothing to surprise. And finally: in this future world where, supposedly, everyone plays this game, how come the adventure features a bunch of guys (with one token, fashionably feisty woman serving as love-interest) versus, you guessed it, a bunch of guys (with one token black-leather clad woman in a tiny part, presumably for the benefit of male viewers who like women in black leather)? A third female does emerge late on as a kind of (hugely predictable) joke/surprise in an even tinier part, but basically this is sexist crap for no reason.Spielberg has made good films but it's been a long while. I haven't seen all his work, and wouldn't want to, but this surely must be the worst. Maybe he should go back to WW2 so he wouldn't have to bother with female characters at all.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Says a lot about Spielberg,"Leave it to Steven Spielberg, I suppose, to make a futuristic dystopia set in a time by which he may very well be dead to, despite excising most references to his own films, be all about him and the late 20th and early 21st-century pop culture he helped create. Those pop-culture references range from uninspired to obtuse--I mean, the Iron Giant is turned into a ""cold war"" gun that does nothing but fire. The CGI animation has the look of virtual-reality video games, so it authentically looks ugly. And, the story--the puppy love, supposed social commentary and all--is as simplistic and oblivious as usual. Spielberg wouldn't know poverty anymore if his Cincinnati youth went to the Hollywood future and slapped him in the face with it. ""Ready Player One"" is a picture much more concerned with the legacy of a dead kazillionaire entertainer with a library dedicated to how his art is egotistically about himself--a creator of juvenile fantasy worlds, à la Spielberg.Yet, this man knows how to make a spectacle. It may not be ""Jaws"" (1975) made in a computer, but, boy, that camera does some marvelous twirling in this simulacrum. For all the action scenes, I think the disco dancing might be the best part in this respect. Once the movie gets beyond the introductory over-exposition and gets his requisite daddy issues out of the way, the plotting isn't too bad, either, with the standard fantasy quest of keys (this is really starting to remind me of ""E.T."" (1982)) and whatnot providing a solid narrative structure.The most brilliant thing in ""Ready Player One,"" though, and reason enough to reservedly recommend it is ""The Shining"" (1980) sequence (in the book, I'm told, the film was ""Blade Runner"" (1982)). This is Spielberg's cinematic philosophy in a nutshell by way of a Stanley Kubrick film. Moreover, instead of just the usual film-within-the-film reflexivity here, where the inner film is within the outer film proper--kind of how the Iron Giant, King Kong, etc. make appearances in the virtual reality that is within ""Ready Player One""--the outer picture, by way of already entering the video-game inner ""film,"" enters the film that is within itself. Both are within each other simultaneously.Nominally, this inner-and-outer film is Kubrick's, but it's all about the movie's surrogate Spielberg's experience of having seen it in his younger days. Inside the Overlook Hotel that is within a virtual cinema, too, it may have the superficial appearance of that sophisticated and perverse horror film, but it's all PG-13 juvenility. Note how the typewritten pages become nothing but another stupid clue (or key) for the keys. How the twins and blood from the elevator becomes an excuse for some stupid adventure. How even brief nudity is exhaustingly avoided. And how the entire point of the reflexive exercise is for nothing more than sappy and trite unrequited love.Oh, yes, the children will learn to defeat the evil corporation so that they may maintain the status quo of the current controlling corporation--but Tuesdays and Thursdays off.

"A jumbled mess of scatter shot images, bad ideas and horrible directing","Keeping this review simple:
1. Almost all of the scenes in the Oasis look AWFUL. Either cartoony or incoherent. There may be a million ""cameos"" but I could barely pick out more then 3. Every thing is dark, colorless and blurry. Action scenes are impossible to follow.
2. The acting is terrible and wooden all around. Forced jokes (literally no one in my theater laughed once) with bad delivery. 
3. It's like it was written and directed by someone who talked to someone who sorta read the book like 10 years ago. Maybe 10% of the book is in there. If you have a favorite part of the book, it ain't in this movie. None of the details that made the story cool or make sense at all appear in this film.
4. The story and dialogue seem like they written by a 12 year old. Boy meets girl, 10 seconds later boy loves girl. Girl pushes him away, 10 seconds later girl loves boy. Boy says lines like : ""Fanboys know haters!""
This movie was a genuine P.O.S. from writing, to acting, to directing to effects. I hate to say, but it did not have a single redeeming quality. And FYI - the Iron Giant is in like 3 minutes of the movie (2 minutes of which already appear in the commercials).",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A well done homage to the pop culture.,"Ready Player One is the return of Spielberg with his work as director, and does not disappoint with his new delivery. A quite entertaining film with moments dedicated especially to pop culture, especially gamer culture, I think that many characters, especially young people, will especially enjoy this work for its enormous amount of direct and indirect references to this genre.The movie is designed to entertain pleasantly, it achieves it with its fantastic special effects, incredible sound design and special soundtrack to activate that nostalgic sensation. With a simple story and a premise without over-complications, the film does not fall into a large number of holes or over-saturation, does a good job presenting itself as it is. A tribute to the world of entertainment.Very entertaining, it is fantastic to admire the incredible action scenes, although if I had to highlight the bad points, well, I would say that this is a film without real motivations, we do not get to feel a great attraction for the characters, each seems to represent an archetype already established without new samples of originality, the creativity of the film lies with its visual presentation, not with its characters which end up being simply averages. Perhaps the only character who really enjoys both the performance and the background story is the creator of the OASIS, which appears a few times, but each time is an emotional sensation that feels like a direct message to the audience. Unfortunately, it doesn't appear too much and the rest of the film is with the main characters which are not bad, but not very good either. Also, it reaches a point where the film is very dependent on references to video games, movies or the like, denoting a sensational overuse for it. Despite this, it is quite fun, entertaining and with excellent special effects, very good for entertaining us.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Game on!,"In spite of the hype, I walked into ""Ready Player One"" with a certain level of apprehension. Given the source material (likable in its own right), it's easy to expect a movie adaptation to crumble under the weight of its own references. But what Spielberg does here (and it's to his immense credit) is tap into the adventure movie escapism that's really at the core of this thing.Don't get me wrong, you have to work for it. The first act is pretty much all setup and cumbersome world-building, sweetened by dazzling effects. And I'm pretty sure the wealth of easter eggs are there to ensure repeat business (or at least give the pause button a workout). But it's actually what goes on in the real world - the interactions between the characters - that makes this so fun. The effects in this movie are impressive, but I found myself taken with the little touches here and there. It's when Spielberg and Alan Silvestri riff on themselves that calls to the movie fan in me. And there's an unexpected heart to these characters and this world that'll have me coming back.It's a rare example of a movie living up to the book and standing on its own.

Ready Player One 2018 Review,"If you like pop culture you're bound to enjoy the majority of this film.The story was great and was pretty enthralling, but I did feel as if it dragged on a little too long.None of the acting was anything to write home about and the majority of characters are mildly forgettable. Our lead, Tye Sheridan, I found to be especially dull.Good god the writing and script is terrible too, it's laced with cliché gamer nonsense that will, and already has aged terribly.However I loved how when the characters were in the Oasis it would literally feel like a huge long video game cinematic, and when you returned to the human world it felt more grounded and less colorful.Other than that, this was pretty good.

4 values of film,"Artistic Value: The film styles reinforce the online gaming culture by showing that gamers who play online can meet people who are either in a different country or in the same country by inviting them to a party chat on the game system they use and inviting them to join their lobby on a certain game if that they both play and play whatever that game features together, they also reinforce the need for a game that has the same features as seen in the movie.Entertainment Value: It's a pretty popular film especially among gamers like me because not only is it solely based on a video game but it has familiar characters from other games like Tracer from overwatch, a group of Spartans from halo, and the toads from the game battle toads, all of which were seen in the trailer for the movie.Educational Value: People might change their perspective on how the view gamers and how they think that gamers don't have any friends and are antisocial when in all reality gamers are more social talking to their friends online then they probably ever would be in real life and that they might be talking to people on the other side of the world and they might have a close enough relationship with each other that they will want a closer friendship or a stronger relationship.Literary Value: The characters are part of the plot because they're all trying to reach the same goal and yet the story is deeper mainly because of the game featured in the movie like the level of money and technology it took to make a game as huge as that.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Dull, boring and overall bad.","With stilted dialogue, bad acting, a predictable plot and sub-par special effects, Ready Player One feels like another bland, boring action movie like Black Panther, yet the movie somehow manages to be worse. It's lead character is painfully bland and uninspired just like everyone else in the movie. The dialogue is stilted at best and cringeworthy at its worst. The only redeemable quality of this movie is the concept of the oasis, but somehow the movie manages to mess that up to, leaving the first 15 or so minutes of the movie to explain the viewer its history and purpose, yet the world doesn't feel real at all, the characters visit 5 or so locations in the oasis, making it feel small instad of the huge universe that it should be. The performances are either terrible or mediocre, even Simon Pegg manages to be mediocre. Every character (with one exception) is one dimensional and bland, especially the main lead and the antagonist who have no motivations for anything they do and are extremely unlikeable and un-relatable. Overall Ready Player One is a boring, dull action movie, with little redeeming qualities and a predictable plot. 2/10",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't listen to the negative reviews! This movie takes you back to everything great.,"I never read the book but, I also never go in expecting the movie to be just like the book. I go in knowing full well the limitations of time and technology that goes into making a movie. Nowadays though, that has been a big blur as technology has caught up quite a lot. 
So with that in mind go see this movie and it will take you back to your first video game experience and your awe and wonder of how technology has come up in the world. From Pong to today's hyper real gaming systems. It will also take you back to the first great movie that put you at the edge of your seat waiting to see what comes next. This movie certainly put me on edge more than once. Also remember the first time ET met Elliot and you said to yourself, Aliens are cool and friendly. Or the time the DeLorean from Back to the Future first sped up to 88 MPH and you thought wow!!! how cool. Or remember the great on-line game you played and you met all kinds of cool friends from all over the world, and you actually met some of them and have been friends since then.
This movie is that and a whole lot more. This is really all new stuff with a bunch of old stuff mixed into one. The references are too numerous to mention or count but you will have a blast each time you recognize one of them.
Go see this movie for the pure fun of it. The pure enjoyment you will get from seeing all your favorite movie and game references. Go see it with lots of friends or family because you will be talking about it for a long time to come. I predict this movie will make the top 10 all time movie greats! but, if not I don't care because it will be engraved in my memory as one of them.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Recommended,"Let's start with the bottom line: This is the most enjoyable Spielberg movie in the past 15 years. Notice I wrote ""enjoyable"" and not ""best"". It's still a kids movie - the plot is simple (it's about literally looking for a MacGuffin - an Easter egg), stuff is spelled out, spoon fed to the audience and repeated twice (even the secret of the 3rd challenge is revealed twice!), so don't expect anything smart. However, it's visually stunning and I regret watching it in 2D because it seems to be the only movie since ""Avatar"" to be worth watching in 3D. Sound is also impressive.There are tons of pop culture references and for us 80's kids, this is a delight. I bet the kids watching this will miss many of those references but for us they are obvious and straight in the face. And there's one big gem in the middle of the movie which I won't spoil, so I'll just say that Kubrick fans will have a blast - I don't know if it's part of the original book but i'm quite certain it was a treat for Spielberg to handle.With references to movies, songs and games appearing almost every two minutes, I have no idea how they could have afford it - I know it's a blockbuster movie but still, the royalties were probably huge (unless the studio owns the rights).The music was an obvious Alan Silvestri work. I thought perhaps it was John Williams trying to imitate Silvestri because it's a Spielberg movie and there were so many 80's references, but checking the credits, it's really him.Mark Rylance was brilliant as Halliday and I honestly didn't recognize him until checking the IMDB credits now. I also didn't recognize Simon Pegg.Aech's voice was terribly miscast (but there's a reason for that, revealed later).All in all, it's a fun movie. If you're an 80's kid and if you liked ""Avatar"" and/or ""Wreck it Ralph"", you'll enjoy this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Very very very disappointing :(,"If you liked the book, then you will probably want to walk out of the theater. This is the worst book to movie adaptation I've ever seen and I'm really not exaggerating. I'm so disappointed. I was so excited about this and it let me down in every way except visually. Take everything about the novel and change it to something less interesting and cheesy and this is what you get. A wonderful modern throwback novel full of creative nostalgia and incredibly compelling characters that gets so mucked around in Hollywood movie filth that what you get on the big screen doesn't even remotely resemble the novel at all.

"Soulless, and dominated by typical ""eye candy""","Especially during the first 30 minutes, I was feeling this movie has no soul... it's lifeless and looking awful. Then it engaged.

If you like action films, the last hour will perhaps satisfy, but IMHO the meager plot became just the usual excuse to show what computers can do. For me, it was tedious and pointless. The characters weren't further developed. One could surmise the outcome. The conflict between reality and virtual reality really wasn't explored. The '80s memorabilia and shout-outs to a vast number of sci-fi stories may delight, but it's all pointless really. The best part was when the movie was over.

Not to mention other references to other films. The plot is also reasonably unique and somewhat flows.However the downfall is the childish and unnecessary love story between the two main actors. This did not work at all and it was nauseating to see Wade close the doors to the lawyers to kiss the girl in what was a very childish and unneeded scene. A lot of teenagers and amateur film goers might have enjoyed it.

Has anyone got a time machine to help me go back and save myself from having to watch this movie.,"While this movie is full of cinematic wonder, that is really where the magic stops. Spielberg sadly took a great book, ripped off the cover, and stuck it on a completely different story.There is no drama, no tension and largely not a lot a story. He did the same thing to Jurassic Park.I was truly disappointed. It started out so well, and then it spun out of control. The only reason I didn't walk out after the first half-an-hour was because I'd taken a friend and it would have been rude to storm out and leave them sat alone. They only came because I'd raved about how great the book was, and how great the movie was going to be.My friend was largely confused, and all I could do was apologise for wasting two hours and twenty minutes of their time.This travesty was made worse because Empire magazine had said that it was a close fit to the book. Shame on Mr Cline, who wrote the book, and also wrote this script. I can't believe an author would do such a spectacular hatchet job on his own material (maybe the blood rushing down the hotel corridor came from all the fans who committed suicide when the saw the prescreening).I wanted this movie to be so much more than it was. And I have no doubt that anyone who is ignorant of the book will find it amusing. But they really shouldn't think too hard otherwise they will spot all the inconsistencies. Like how artimus has the landline numbers for all the five players when they are all keeping their identities secret.Sadly I don't own a working delorian with functioning time-travel to enable me to go back to yesterday and tell me to not buy the tickets.This joins the only other movie that I will never watch again.

This is not the book.... at all!,"The movie is an adaptation from the book of the same name. The writer himself Ernest Cline is created as one of screenplay writers which suprised me. This movie... has nothing to do with the book.I expected a few changes, that's normal considering the amount of references to pop culture in the book and how licensing works for movie adaptations. Thing is even the plot, characters and end message were changed.This went from a coming of age story, a boy learning that escaping to ""his oasis"" is not the solution. You have to fight for what you want. sacrifice everything for those you care about. There is also a message in there regarding the dangers of corporate takeover of the net, seven full years before the net neutrality issue came up.What does this one do? The challenges are changed completely. The characters that he meets along the way and is united with them against a common enemy are his buddies from the beginning. Even the lesson changes to simply... the power of friendship.That's it. Oh and gaming is for the young that love to play not corporate thugs, who fund their development and market them in the first place.To me this is such a childish plot it's barely a six star movie however because of all the nostalgia they throw at you and the epicness of the final battle I'm adding one extra star.

"Great Movie, Lots of Fun.","Review:
'Ready Player One' is a science-fiction-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg. It is based on the Ernest Cline novel of the same name.
While watching a bunch of Spielberg movies both old and new, this one sticks out to be one of the better new ones. With CGI being what it is today, and with Spielberg being the creator of multiple fan favorites, they could get away with lots in this movie.
The film takes place in 2045, when humanity uses the virtual reality software called the OASIS to escape the desolation of the real world. Orphaned teenager Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) discovers clues to a hidden game within the program that promises the winner full ownership of the OASIS and joins several allies to try to complete the game before a large company run by businessman Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn) can do so.
The cast all around is great, but Tye Sheridan are Olivia Cooke are the standouts for sure. They have great chemistry together both romantically in the real world and when kicking ass in the OASIS. Mark Rylance and Simon Pegg are fun in supporting roles as well.
I was a little concerned that since this movie is mostly CGI, that the story may get lost in the crazy world that was created. I don't believe that is the case at all. I think they blended the world perfectly and told a story worth watching.
Overall, I will be revisiting this movie soon. Anybody who loves Spielberg's direction and storytelling will love this movie.

Easter egg hunt with goggles,"Greetings again from the darkness. While there is a massive target audience for Steven Spielberg's return to fantasy adventure filmmaking, I am most certainly not part of that esteemed group. Although I very much enjoy throwbacks and tributes, I haven't touched a video game controller in 3 decades, and of course have not read Ernest Cline's popular novel - the source material that inspired Mr. Spielberg to veer from his recent heavy dramas (the exception being THE BFG). Still, being a movie lover, I couldn't help but be intrigued by the project.
Seemingly a match made in Virtual Reality heaven, we get one of the premier fantasy filmmakers joining forces with a screenwriter (Zak Penn) who has had success with comic book adaptions, and a bestselling first novel from a geeky author. Fascinating to watch, the film plays like Mr. Spielberg's $175 million personal toy box.There is a story, though one could argue it exists solely for the purpose of pushing the visual FX envelope. A Steve Jobs-type guru named Halliday (Mark Rylance) designed a 3-part contest of skill and strategy with the grand prize being full control over OASIS - a virtual world that allows the players to be anyone or anything they desire. Since Halliday's death, most people in this dystopian future of the year 2045 spend their waking hours immersed in OASIS. Some use it as an escape from their bleak lives, while others are attempting to solve the mysteries of the 3 keys.Set in Columbus, Ohio, which we are informed is the fastest growing city in the world (why??), there are two factions vying for the grand prize: true gamers/gunters and megacorporation IOI being run by corporate villain Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn). Tye Sheridan (MUD) stars as Wade Watts, whose avatar is Parzival, one of the more thoughtful characters. Olivia Cooke (THOROUGHBREDS) plays Ar3mis, a rebel gunter (egg hunter) out more for revenge than victory. They are part of a group of misfits who label themselves 'High-Five', even though Parzival gets left hanging every time.Near non-stop action and relentless pacing result in a whirlwind of lights and colors and visuals that are mixed with more 1980's pop culture references than anyone could possibly catch in one viewing. As a primer, you should brace yourself for a key role from THE IRON GIANT (1999), as well as various appearances and nods to TRON, BACK TO THE FUTURE, Freddie Krueger, Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY, the Holy hand grenade (Monty Python), the infamous Big Foot monster truck, a speeding DeLorean, the 1960's era Batmobile, that hideous A-Team van, Christine from CHRISTINE (1983), John Hughes, King Kong, BEETLEJUICE, and a personal favorite, Buckaroo Bonzai. It's also a kick to see the Rubik renamed Zemeckis Cube. The most stunning sequence for this old geezer was the virtual recreation of Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING (1980), especially the focus on Room 237. It's these kind of nostalgic injections that prevent it from coming across as an overblown CGI spectacle with VR goggles.Others in the cast (more time as voices than real people) include Lena Waithe (""Master of None""), TJ Miller as a bounty hunter with some of the film's best one-liners, Simon Pegg as Halliday's former business partner, and Phillip Zhao as Sho. Surely you've figured out that this one isn't about the cast. OASIS is where your imagination rules and Easter eggs are driving plot lines. Alan Silvestri takes over the music from usual Spielberg collaborator John Williams, and delivers one of my favorite references (and one of the oldest) in the film - Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971). Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski must have been exhausted by the time filming was complete, though we can't always tell what was filmed and what was created in the lab. Spielberg is a master manipulator when it comes to nostalgia, though we can't help but wonder if he is making a statement with this being the next evolution as our society becomes ever-more-involved with their phones and personal devices. At least maybe some kid will leave this film with a greater appreciation of research.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The cast was really good and fresh and the story was really well scripted.As a gamer I really enjoyed the way the film adapted that in to the action as well as the nostalgia of many easter eggs in the form of references and scenes from the past.It is a great film and I think you will enjoy it so give it a watch.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fresh movie,"Ready Player One is one of the best movies in 2018!
So many reasons to be... 
The first reason is it has a lot of Easter Eggs that I was amazed to see in one movie.
The second reason is that the story and the way to tell are new and cool.
The third reason is the cast, the cast was good in the VR mode, but it was not that good outside of it!
The fourth reason is the CGI, it was fine as a movie in 2018, but as a story-line in 2045, it wasn't that good.
But it wasn't mistake-less, it has some drops too!
The biggest one is that the voices weren't fitting on the Players in the VR mode.
And the way Samantha escaped from her cage, wasn't really convincing!
I totally loved it... And quickly it has been one of my favorite movies!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The amount of CGI and graphics will never be a disadvantage with genius director,"I think it wasn't an easy idea to produce a movie with approximately 60-70% of it CGI or graphics, to be honest I was a little afraid before watching this movie because of this amount of graphics and also I was worried because the idea of this movie talking about video game and of course it something needs a young director to be familiar with this subject, but Spielberg impressed everyone as usual.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg's new entry of childlike wonder and nostalgia,"Ready Player one captures some aspects of the wonder of game and fully utilized the sense of 80s nostalgia in a way that none other than Steven Spielberg would be able to. The film delivers a brilliant message about the purpose of gaming and perhaps an extended metaphor to life much like the way in which many of Spielberg's film presents big messages in relatively simple yet heartfelt and genuine narratives.Perhaps none other can helm such a project and not make us seem like a completely bloated film filled with attempts of selling the 80s nostalgia for commercial success.However, inspire of these praises to the film it does seem lacking in some areas too. I personally did not see the development of the characters or the sentimental values that characters hold, even though as previously mentioned Spielberg does manage to deliver that sense of genuine emotions and themes. It's just that in many cases these aren't delivered through the characters themselves.While simple but effective is often Spielberg's calling card in this case many of the story beats were predictable and thus unimpactful. Much like the recent ""BFG"" which manages a good ideology but lacking in complexion and further intrigue.While the many references were certainly enough to have fans dig through frame by frame for ages there also just was this sense of underuse and lack of purpose of these characters. In other words they just seem to be there, of course it is impossible to fit all of this into the span of a movie but perhaps that is exactly why this was an absolute challenge for any director to take on.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Ambitious, but failed","The movie was supposed to combine the audiences for younger and for older people. Gaming references and ,,twitch'' and other similar mentions were there to entertain younger, gamer, audiences while ,,Rosebud'', the famous ending from Citizen Kane, and Shining scenes were initially there for the people who have a longer experience with cinema. Spielberg tried but didn't succed combining this to make it a good movie. The romance in the movie also backfired making it exceptionally boring. Action scenes were good at the beginning but it got slower and slower.All in all, it might be good for your kids, and perhaps people in the future will like it, but now I do not recommend it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A Return To Big-Screen Spectacle, But Not Spielberg's Best","At the heart of this adaptation of Ernest Cline's 2011 novel is a fairly simple premise: the real world sucks, but a virtual reality world called the Oasis allows people to forget about reality for a little while. For Wade Watts (Tye Sheridan), that concept is enough. But there are others who want the Oasis for themselves, and still others fighting to stop them, with virtual consequences spilling out into the real world.The mainstream appeal to this film, at least based on the advertising alone, is the nostalgia vibe that permeates this film, like so many other films and TV shows these days. And this is certainly a reference-laden film, what with the main character's vehicle of choice being a certain time machine.However, aside from all the references is a story of a struggle between the little guy trying to keep a good thing going and maybe improve on it for the benefit of the people and an evil corporation who sees only profit in their world, and will do anything to claim the throne.The key lies in the storytelling, and for the most part this film actually manages to tell a well-paced story that gives just enough technical details to keep you going but doesn't bog itself down in minutia. Though the film does sometimes go out of its way to indulge in a reference, most of the time sticking the landing, the fact is it comes dangerously close to going overboard in its treatment of pop culture references, especially if the same fact is repeated several times in the span of a few minutes.The main disadvantage of this film is when it leaves the virtual world and enters reality. We as the audience bond to the virtual avatars of our main characters, and beside the villain, who we see more in the real world than the virtual, we see relatively little of our protagonists in the real world, which is a good thing sine the actors and actresses, though competent, really don't engender any lasting connection between character and viewer.Overall, I would say this film is best appreciated on the big screen, but probably not at full price. Be prepared to do some Googling if you didn't live through the 80s.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Get ready for some action! ;),"When I saw the trailers, I completely underestimated the movie's relevance. This film leads you into a mix of virtual reality and reality. First I thought, this is maybe the first time I will be disappointed by a Steven Spielberg movie. But I had a feeling, that I should give it a try ... and I did. That was a very good decision. It's definitly a movie for the big screen because of many opulent pictures - there is much to see and admire. :)It's the story of a VR-Mogul, who invented the ""OASIS"", a VR-world, where everything can happen. All the world joins the Oasis for mostly the whole day. But the maker is gone and want's to pass the Oasis posthume to somebody who is worthy, someone who is responsible. So the whole world starts to hunt three special easter-eggs from the owner, and solve riddles to become the new owner of the Oasis, as the main character does. There are also a few sidekicks that make the story very interesting.""Ready Player One"" is a very fluent told story about the dangers of being online all the time without a raised indexfinger. This movie is all about the chances one can take and friendship, to team up with friends and covering friends. With it's 2 hours and 20 Minutes, the movie was so stuffed with action sequeces that make sense, but not only that. Over the whole movie there are hidden hints from the 70's till today, many strong pop & rock-songs from the 80's, and many allusions to earlier games and Anime-Characters. The audience is bombed by hints and things, that let us remember earlier times, when we were young. And now our kids do the same. So it's a perfect movie for modern families. :DIt's for fathers and mothers, who played with game-consoles when they were kids. It's for kids, who will love this version of online-world and friendship-story. So the whole family can discuss the dangers of being always online without demonizing the online world we have today. And I can say that I was perfect entertained over nearly the whole movie. So why giving it only 9/10 Stars? It has one mediocre logical error in a key-scene that catches the eye. I can't tell what it is without spoiling. If that wouldn't have happened, i would have given it the full 10 Stars. I like the message of the movie. :D",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Probably the best movie for Nerds.,"So I just watched this movie. It's a combination of sci -fi, action and adventure. Film was directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tye Sheridan.
Movie takes place in USA in the year 2045. Reallity is not very pleasant so the humankind spend almost all time in VR. This VR is called Oasis and it's actually just a game that became something more. People work in it, play in it, just anyhing.
Plot of this movie is that creator of this ''game'' and one of the richest humans on earth dies. And because he doesn't have any successors, he desides to give all his money and controll over Oasis to winner of competition. This winner have to find something like easter egg in game. Story by it self is not something ground breaking but that doesn't really matter.
I found this movie really gripping. Effects in it are spectacular. And I love the animation of Oasis.
I think that this is a film made for geeks and nerds. I don't want to say others can't enjoy it. I just want to say that nerds like me will enjoy it more. Thats because in every scene is a lot of references from comics, serials, games and more. For people who won't get them, this movie may look average. But if you are even a little interested in any of these things, you will probably love it. Spielberg made once again a masterpiece.And one last thing.

One Level Above Mid,"The plot falls short especially with the main group of protagonists, who remain underdeveloped and stale by the end of the story. Like it's quite obvious Daito and Sho exist purely for Chinese audiences to fawn over. Would it really have killed them to develop either of these two characters even a little? On another note, the villain is perfect for the world being built with this story. He's a gd cartoon character with insane yet understandable motivations. I love how they handled him in the movie.But I must say, the visual effects are indeed stunning. It could have been used on better writing, but despite the runtime that can drag, this is an overall fun time especially if you ignore the way the video game world works, because the more one analyses it the more frustrating and in disbelief I was left. It's obvious they had to take some liberties in making characters act totally different from what nerds IRL would do if this story was real, like how the main character was the first to hit reverse at the start of the first big race. Yeah right, but I'll let it slide.I find it hysterical how seamlessly Spielberg managed to craft a grand-scale video game epic that manages to be kick ass despite its many faults while simultaneously conveying to impressionable younger audiences that reality is more important than any digital fantasy, the caution one must take when engaging in online relationships, and the importance of touching grass.

"The best video game movie ever created, but nothing like the original book","Now let me start off by saying that I am a massive fan of the original novel by Ernest Cline. It is one of my most treasured pieces of literature, and as a gamer, it appeals to me on pretty much every level.This next segment is important: before you walk into the theater to watch this movie, you have to remember one thing: THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING LIKE THE BOOK. Only about 15-20% of the original story is present here in Spielberg's adaption, so if you were hoping for a 100% accurate recreation of the book, I'm sad to tell you that you won't find it here.Is the book better than the movie?
Yes, in pretty much every way. The clues are way harder to find, more thought out, requires the main character to also find something called ""Gates"" which has been entirely scrapped for the movie and it has a way more pressing atmosphere of risk and defeat. It's, in a way, more realistic. So if you enjoyed the movie, I HIGHLY recommend you to go pick up the book, as it is simply a better and more detailed experience.Now, is the movie still good?
Yes. Yes it absolutely is. The visuals are stunning, the audio is well put together and the story is relatively easy to follow and immerse yourself in, even if you're not a gamer at heart (like a lot of us are).
If you are a gamer, you're definitely going to appreciate all of the references Spielberg put in this. Whilst watching the movie, I made it a point to try and spot as many references as I could, but that turned out to be impossible, as there is simply too many to catch all of them in only one viewing of the movie. But I'm pleased to report that the references I did catch definitely satisfied me and even made me laugh at times.Summary:
Ready Player One is a one-of-a-kind adventure that pretty much has to be experienced by anyone who calls themselves a gamer, or is interested in any form of gaming or pop-culture. With amazing visuals and jaw-dropping action, the movie is pretty much just a lot of fun to watch.

A Film about Pop Icons by a Pop Icon,"The notion of pairing a film about Pop Icons with a Director who is himself one (not to mention creating much of the iconography within the story-line) should, in theory, have resulted in either something grand or a fascinating disaster. But, as with much of Spielberg's work over the past decade or more, it ends up landing softly in between.The plot is pretty simple even with all the high tech diversions. In the future (2045), an eccentric Game Developer Halliday (Mark Rylance, fine as always) has created the ultimate VR world where we are told millions chose to spend much of their 'waking' hours - Oasis. When Halliday passes on, he leaves behind the ultimate 'Easter Egg' - solve three clues, and you can inherit the rights to Oasis. Halliday is like a kinder, friendlier combination of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg (complete with elbowing out his co-founder Morrow (Simon Pegg). Our young hero Wade (Tye Sheridan) and heroine Samantha (Olivia Cooke) use their knowledge of Halliday and Oasis to try and decipher the riddle. Coming up against them is a generic corporate baddie Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn).Of course, a film like this isn't about the plot as much as it is about the visuals and effects, and, ever the pro, Spielberg has assembled a talented team to pull those off admirably. His long-time Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski shot as much of the movie on film as feasible, but, with all the CGI parts were digitally captured and rendered. I saw it on 70mm film and it looked very good even if a movie about VR isn't the best usage of the medium. And, of course, much of the joy/task of watching R.P.O. will be a game of 'Spot The Pop Culture Reference'! Many of the images are so densely packed that it is impossible to see them on all in one viewing. This is one Blu Ray/Stream that will re-watched over and over by many.There is fun to be had with R.P.O. even if it never truly takes off. The cast is game. The concept is understandable, and the payoff is suitably well delivered. But, without being ageist - this is very much a film from an older man's perspective. All the 80s and 90s references are explained as being from Halliday's childhood, but, it certainly doesn't help make the movie seem any less an exercise in half-baked nostalgia. Would kinds two decades from now really find pop culture artifacts from 65 years earlier to be the hippest thing on earth (and, in the case of Harryhausen's Cyclops - nearly 90 years)!?? A few more nods to the 21st century would have been nice. Couldn't the bland white middle-aged evil Sorrento have been a woman? A minority? A robot? But, this plays very plays like a movie that could have been made in the 80s if CGI technology had existed. As one friend said, it's like a Spielberg 80s movie - not one he Directed, but that he produced -- i.e. BACK TO THE FUTURE, THE GOONIES, *batteries not included etc.. Instead of his usual composer John Williams, we get Zemeckis fave Alan Silvestri who contributes another of his 2nd rate Jerry Goldsmith-like scores.READY PLAYER ONE is a decent diversion. Spielberg is such a master that even when he outright fails (B.F.G., HOOK), his professionalism never allows them to be truly awful. And, maybe, that's a problem with his more recent work. If you don't take big risks, you rarely achieve greatness. R.P.O. isn't bad, but, it's oh so safe.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
even worse than the book,"The book being a horrible piece of fiction, but quite profuse in its imagery, a movie seemed like a really good chance to build on its strengths and try to round the story and the characters into either a decent movie for kids/young adults or a good sci-fi product.disappointingly, the only thing that remains is the imagery (watched it as IMAX 3D, I imagine lots get lost with any other version) and a hint at the end about a very different movie focused on Halliday (which could have been but is not).
Mark Rylance and Olivia Cooke have good performances, even when their parts do not lend themselves to that. for the rest of the characters, there is simply not enough entity to build anything. maybe this was meant to be a larger movie at some point (a better one too).everything else is a fiasco, with a not well developed 2nd act, a therefore lazy 3rd act, and plenty of rolling eyes moments. comedy is interspersed here and there and references are thrown around like some people use cheddar on salads: just because it's there in the fridge and what the heck, let's use all of it. that's a problem with the book as well, but at least the book operates as a window into the mind of the writer (meta-interesting, not interesting itself). here it seems just an attempt to make it more palatable to audiences of all ages, without really trying to provide any consistency.6 because, hey! it is movie kind of coherent and some sequences are actually entertaining, maybe even worthy of another watch. just not the movie as a whole.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Visual masterpiece loaded with a cornucopia pop culture references,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. It was such a delight to watch. Only Steven Spielberg can deliver such high quality. The race sequence in the first half of the movie was out of this world; best animated one I've seen for sure. The special effects were top notch. 
The pop culture references man, if I write about them, it'll be an entire separate 500 word article; and I just got like half of them. The video game ones kinda went over my head however I got like 90% of the movie references. 
The story for me was a little too long. Not enough time was spent on character development and it felt rushed. Things happen too quickly between the characters which defy normal conventions. 
That aside a major part of the movie is really engaging. If you're a movie buff who is into sci fi movies, this is the one you cannot miss.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Visually one of the best movies I've ever seen,"This movie is a perfect example of why I like sci-fi fantasy movies. The story was almost entirely unpredictable (I didn't read the book), and even though I didn't like some parts of it, the rest more than made up for that. This might be the best movie I've ever seen in terms of visual content. There is an amazing variety of different things to see.If you aren't sure whether or not to watch it based on reviews... my opinion is that you should always give a movie a chance if it has at least one positive review and you think there's a possibility that you'd like it. Different people like and dislike every movie, so you may as well figure out for yourself if you like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

So much cgi,Okay I know the movie is set in a virtual world so jam packed with computer animated visuals I couldn't help but think why didn't they just make the whole thing an animated feature?

Philip K. Dumb,"I love Spielberg - he made four of my favorite movies of all time - but file this one under his ""missed opportunities"" section.There was a great premise buried deep behind this, a cyberpunk quest with intriguing philosophical elements. The execution is juvenile, clunky and masturbatory though. What's truly baffles me is how set-pieces are visually busy and tiresome: it is, in a word, tawdry, which is astonishing for Spielberg.This CGI MacGuffin hunt feels more like a barrage of MMORPG trailers than Blade Runner. Pity, really.5.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Spielberg's back, but for the worse","2/4I got the pleasure of seeing Spielberg's first ""crowd-pleaser"" in over a decade in theatres. The veteran director is characterized by works spanning the 80s and 90s, and his name was recognized by both buffs and casual movie-goers alike. Now, he's the center of attention again with his comeback: Ready Player One.I enjoyed it for what it was, but I was very disappointed. There were many plot holes, and (for me) many questions left unanswered. As far as the book, I haven't read it and can't criticize the story itself.The special effects are the best I've ever seen in a Spielberg movie. He truly brought it to life in a unique way. Another theme prevalent in the cinematography was dimming the colors in scenes not in the OASIS. Also, the background was blurry whenever Parsival and Art3mis we're together in the OASIS. I thought these were very nice touches. The nostalgia, however, was as abundant as it was obvious. (especially The Shinjng sequence) It called for a far more subtle, less in-your-face type of throwback. In addition, the references could be very forced or out of place (the race at the beginning with the T-Rex and King Kong). In short, it was tired and overbearing.Our protagonist, Wade, is a resident of Columbus, Ohio in the year 2045. He lives in a ghetto known as ""The Satcks"" (trailers stacked on top of one another) in a world so filled with problems that all anyone does is escapes reality. This is done in a virtual world known as the OASIS. Halliday, the creator of the OASIS, made a contest to find an Easter Egg. Whoever found it would gain control over the entire OASIS. While this isn't a drama, one can't help but wonder what exactly these problems are, as most of what you see outside of the OASIS is the small trailer park community.In the OASIS, Wade is among the elite, which is the opposite from his real-life status. This is where his best friends are, in this virtual world.
In the OASIS, you never truly know what's going on. You have to fill in way to many blanks, because the OASIS feels like more of an unfinished concept. Also, since most of the movie takes place here, in this mystery world, the blanks become plot holes rather rapidly.
Secondly, since the movie jumps between Earth and the OASIS, the character development aspect felt lacking. It's a shame, these were relatable characters, and you'd want to know them in a deeper, more complex level. Instead, it felt like the 2 hours that they were on screen equated their entire life-span.The OASIS is where Wade's entire life is, except for his tough-love aunt and uncle. One definite negative was the light-hearted manner in which the movie took into account their death. When Wade learned his ""stack"" was going to blown up by the IOI, he called home to have his drunk uncle pick up the phone. When he doesn't listen, the stack toppled over and they both die. The scene cuts, and there is no sign that Wade is conflicted emotionally (as would be the norm) until almost half an hour later. He confronts the perpetrator with a very weak blow: You killed my mother's sister! This is another example of weak character development. Spielberg should have established emotional connection between the characters. On the contrary, Halliday was overly developed compared to much more pivotal characters. These proportions ultimately felt shallow.The IOI felt more like a government agency than a private organization. It gave one missable scene of clarity what would happen if they found Halliday's Easter Egg. The OASIS under the control of the IOI would be flooded with subscription fees and micro transactions. Considering they killed everyone in Wade's stack and practiced forced labor, you think they would do a bit more?This movie doesn't resonate with you the way Jurassic Park, ET, Jaws, or Indiana Jones did. It feels like Spielberg's last goodbye to the movie industry, in which he did so much good for. At the same time, this didn't feel like Spielberg. This movie is more in the spirit of Linklater, only more haphazardly crafted. This movie is proof that Spielberg has another epic movie in him. As opposed to reliving the 80's, he only reminisces them.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fun, geeky wish-fulfilment","Based on the book by Ernest Cline, though not following its plot closely, Ready Player One is set in a dystopian future where environmental and societal breakdown has led to widespread poverty, with rich and poor alike escaping from grim reality into the OASIS, a Second Life-like virtual reality created by reclusive genius and cyberpunk Willy Wonka James Halliday. Halliday has died, and announced that the inheritor to his company and vast wealth will be determined by an ""Easter Egg"" hunt following clues he has hidden within the OASIS. Our hero, Wade Watts, is an orphan who lives with his aunt in a slum of stacked trailers, and spends his free time in the OASIS as ""Parzival"", an egg hunter, or ""gunter"", one of the die-hard seekers of Halliday's clues who spend their time combing through details of his life and the pop cultural artefacts he loved in the hope of solving Halliday's puzzle. The film follows Wade as he makes progress, makes friends despite his initial determined unclannishness, falls in love with fellow gunter Art3mis and battles corporate greed in the form of Innovative Online Industries.The references to the 80s nerd culture of Halliday's childhood sit more lightly in the visual medium of the film than they did in the book, which I suspect is a good thing. I was puzzled that a book that, like the film, seemed so clearly targeted at today's teens spent so long on nostalgia for the products of the era of my own childhood. The OASIS looks fab, and the dystopian futuristic ""real-world"" is quite nicely depicted too. The film has things to say about the climate crisis, monetisation of online spaces, the community of fandom, the balance between real and online life, and how people can construct different identities online but still build real relationships. None of these things are particularly sophisticated, but they're important topics for our times and it's good they're raised at all. And while I could wish that the central romance was a bit more complex than cool, pretty, apparently female online avatar turns out to be a front for a cool, pretty, real-life girl, albeit one with a bit of a hang-up about a birthmark, this film is fun, geeky wish-fulfilment and I'm not going to begrudge it.(As a postscript, watching this film did get me investigating online whether there were any plans for an adaptation of Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, a book that Ready Player One in some respects reminded me of, but which I much preferred. It appears that there is a possible Prime series in development, albeit one that looks to be moving very slowly. I will keep my fingers crossed!)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great escapism and fun,I really enjoyed this even though the plot holes and practicalities of a literary work of fiction don't always make much sense in the final stages of the story. Loads of pop culture/ 80's references which were fun to spot. It felt like it was made with real care and was an interesting take on a near future. Liked the casting and Mark Rylance was excellent as the enigmatic creator type character. Even better than when he plays Flop in Bing!,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is a movie worth watching once that is a 10/10 for animation and a 5/10 for storyline and ending.,"Ready Player One (2018) is a movie my wife and I watched on HBOMax recently. The storyline follows a futuristic world that looks really different from the world we know. They play video games in suits where they can experience and feel everything. One day a tournament starts where the winner wins a lot of money and can potentially unlock an Easter egg that provides ability and access to components of the game and information no one has ever seen. The young man will put everything he has into winning to better his and his family's life. He meets a young lady in the game with similar ambitions where they can learn from each other. This movie is directed by Steven Spielberg (Jaws) and stars Tye Sheridan (Mud), Olivia Cooke (Sound of Metal), Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead), T. J. Miller (Deadpool) and Lena Waithe (Queen and Slim). The storyline for this is very interesting with fantastic settings, characters and circumstances. The animation was out of the world and very well done. I loved how they included everything from cartoon characters, action heroes and horror movie elements. The acting was solid and fit the characters well. My biggest complaint would be this movie was probably 20 minutes too long and many scenes were dragged out, especially the ending which seemed to have 2-3 conclusions on top of each other to the point the movie got painful. Overall this is a movie worth watching once that is a 10/10 for animation and a 5/10 for storyline and ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Good Spielbergian fun, even if slightly unremarkable","As with many, Spielberg is one of my idols in filmmaking. I defend him against many of his detractors as he has consistently made some of the great ""popcorn munchers"" and some wonderful historical dramas that have truly stood the test of time. That being said, it has been a while since I loved a Spielberg film (his double whammy of Catch Me if You Can and Minority Report in 2002 being his most recent greats). His films since then have been relegated to ""good"" or simply ""passable"". Even films like Lincoln haven't really stayed with me as much as Spielberg's earlier works. Sadly, Reader Player One has fallen into that category. That's not to say it's a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed it quite a bit. However, it's a flawed film in which many of its elements could've been drastically improved upon. 
As someone who read the source material, the many changes to the book didn't bother me too much. The novel did give me mixed feelings overall anyway. On one hand, the child in me enjoyed reading references to pop culture that I love. On the other, it suffers from an overabundance of ""nostalgia porn"". Those who enjoyed the novel might be disappointed that so much has been changed. Those who didn't might enjoy the film more. For me, I did appreciate the changes as it made it more exciting for someone who has already read the book.
The biggest problem with the film are the characters. None of them are bad but they don't stick with you at all. All the actors do good enough jobs, but we never really feel their plight enough because they're very poorly developed. Without spoiling anything, there's a moment in which the protagonist Wade suffers a terrible loss. Yet, we don't feel anything because we don't care about him enough. The characters are mainly a catalyst to get to the next exciting set piece. Since we don't care about them though, it makes the action less exciting. Halliday is the most interesting character, but Mark Rylance is underused. His relationship with Morrow (Simon Pegg) is one of the most compelling but we don't see enough of it to get invested. The movie suffers from an insane amount of exposition in the first half an hour. Whilst it is nice knowing how the Oasis works, this time could've been better spent developing the characters, especially Wade. On a side note, Simon Pegg also suffers from the same syndrome that Benedict Cumberbatch suffered in Doctor Strange, that of ""Iknowyourebritishsojustbebritishdonttrytobeamerican"" syndrome.
However, the film is an absolute visual treat. I would've liked to have seen the Oasis have a seedier side more akin to Spielberg's A.I but the world does look amazing. All the set pieces are well crafted, with one standing out as Spielberg's finest since Minority Report. Despite my issues with the characters, after the exposition heavy first act, the pace for the film really picks up and its 2hour20 minute runtime speeds by in a flash. Despite my issues with the pop culture heavy centre of the novel, I did enjoy seeing many of the references to past pop culture icons, especially how they were used in the final battle. And even the typical, Spielbergian schmaltzy ending did tug at my heartstrings, delivering a positive message for this technology-based generation.And finally, a question for Spielberg? Spielberg, or at least his films. He delivered both the highest grossing film and film franchise of that decade in the form of E.T and Indiana Jones. Yet, Spielberg was already a well-established director before this. Is the need to adapt something so based around 80s pop culture a way of Spielberg attempting to revisit and capture what made his previous films so adored by millions? Is this Spielberg's attempt to become relevant again? I am unsure, but it seems as if he is returning to his roots as a ""popcorn"" director rather than the historical, ""Oscar baity"" filmmaker that he has become recently.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A different film,"I was very excited for this film, it being one of my favourite books of all time but I have to give it 1 star for the main reason that Spielberg has ruined this. The premise is exactly the same but he has lost the whole 80's culture from the book, all the references and jokes. They have squashed it right down and lost the feel for it. The film would have been better as a trilogy. Would have made more sense and more money for the studio. The way the keys were ""found"" were a joke, any modern pop culture reference that is popular just now he threw in there for no reason at all and threw in a kiss for the love story side of things.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Spielberg tries to do a Spielberg-tribute film and can't quite pull it off,"Like the TV series Stranger Things, Ready Player One is suffused with nostalgia for the sort of movies Steven Spielberg was making in the 80s; big fun movies with spunky kids and cool special effects.Set in a dystopian world where people escape the grim real world for an exciting virtual one, the movie resolves around a virtual-world search for keys that will grant ownership of the entire enterprise to the finder. The hunt is undertaken by amateurs like protagonist Wade and by a mega-corporation with hundreds of gamer employees. Who will win out win out, the plucky teen or the resource-heavy corporation? (Hint: it's a Spielberg movie.)The movie is full of 80s music and movie references, but the movie never makes clear why (it wasn't until I read a plot synopsis of the book that I understood it's because the virtual-world's creator was a big 80s geek) nor , with maybe one exception, makes the 80s integral to the plot.The script is frustratingly lazy. The first brilliant thing Wade does is the sort of thing someone would have done by then anyway. After a major crime, there's no investigation and no one even calls the police, yet the movie never establishes a world where people would react that way. While the competition between Wade and the corporation is portrayed as of great consequence, the reasons it's so important are vague, forcing the movie to rely on the CEO being horribly evil. In a scene that particularly aggravated me, Wade sends out a call for help to a world even though it's never been established that anyone understands the stakes or even that there are stakes. Spielberg is too experienced to make a movie that simply assumes everyone in the film knows everything the audience does.Yes, there are exciting special effects, and I probably would have enjoyed this more on a big screen where I could fully appreciate the crazy mix of avatars, but a movie has to be more than it's special effects. And outside of an intriguing performance by Mark Rylance, there's not a lot outside of the effects.Also, there's just a lack of ... something. One of the film's most notable set pieces takes place in a virtual Overlook Hotel, and while it's cute, it feels a bit wan. I think the actual 1980s Spielberg would have done it so much better.And that's a lot of the problem. Spielberg is an old man whose best recent movies like Bridge of Spies and War Horse are from a mature director. Spielberg is simply the wrong person to make a Spielberg tribute film.While I hate movie reviews that talk about the different movie that could have been made, I would have been more interested in a movie that considered the way in which escaping to a virtual world would cause people to let their own real world collapse. It's such an obvious take that it feels like the movie is purposely not pursuing it because they want to keep things light.And yes, they keep things light. This movie is as light as air. It is pure fluff. For all its grand scale, it is a very slight movie. But a perfectly watchable one.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wanted to like it....,"Ready Player One plays things extremely safe. While I haven't read the book, I get the feeling some of the artistic elements were lost in it's translation to a modern era film. What I mean by that is that it takes away your ability to be imaginative when everything is shown visually. It has some fun action and effects, but is totally unoriginal. Furthermore, it has A LOT of pop culture references that people seem to like, but none of them have any purpose and to me, they take away from it's identity.
The story is simple and entertaining enough, though it doesn't have some plot holes and non sensical moments. Characters are pretty two demensional and writing is a little flat.
Overall it's an average movie, but there's another thing:*this is a rant*
I want to talk about the message at the end of this movie; it just annoys me and feels out of touch. When you say ""reality is the only thing thats real"", what exactly do you mean?? When you say that, you raise the question, ""what is real?"". Most of this movie takes place inside the Oasis. Are the lessons these characters learned and the things they acomplished and the relationships they formed ""not real"" then?! If you say yes, then then thats pretty dumb because all you're left with is the message ""don't spend your whole life playing video games"" which is hilariously ironic. You're telling me the guy who invents a whole virtual world because he seems slightly autistic and dose'nt fit in socially says that that experience isn't real, wtf😂!? What are they trying to say? .
Let me tell you my opinion: Virtual/gaming experiences CAN absolutely be real. My definition of ""real"" experience is one of genuine substance and growth. The right types of games and other media absolutely do grow us as people. It doesn't matter if they didn't occur in the physical world. We could have learned things, felt emotion, or in the case of online gaming, met people, worked together, learned to negotiate, coordinate, stratigise. How is that not real? If you think I'm over interpreting this message, but what else does can it mean?

The most important game of his life,"I have to marvel at the computer graphics that Steven Spielberg used in creating

of playing these games hours on end is totally lost to me. My ignorance of these
matters makes it hard to follow the plot in something like this. For instance the
Matrix series. I've watched those films and I haven't reviewed them because I'm
not sure of what I watched. This was a bit better.In 2045 the world is really a rotten place and folks like young Tye Sheridan have retreated into their own cyber world called The Oasis. It's where with

cyber friends once again as they all compete looking for prizes in the cyber
world called Easter Eggs. Get three and he's a winner.Sheridan does meet his friends again in the cyber world and in the real one.

The romance between the lead characters seemed forceful. Despite the actors doing a great job, I think it's some chopped up reel on the production house floor that may make us feel it is forced.

"Ready For Action, Visuals, and Nostalgia","Robbie K back with another review and tonight it is on movie I have been looking forward to for a very long time. The latest book gone pop culture, tonight's film is all about the references (and merchandising) as the world seeks out an adequate video game movie to come to life. So, let's get started with a slight alteration to the style, as I review:Title: Ready Player One
Director: Steven Spielberg
Writer: Zak Penn
Original Author: Ernest Cline
Starring: Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben MendelsohnLIKES:Acting: Let's get this like out of the way (as most won't care). The cast of this highly CGI world is on point in regards to making their characters come to life. Sheridan in particular does a lot of the heavy lifting, balancing the geek, leader, and vulnerable roles all into a nice admirable package. Cooke has the edgy, heroic nature down, a virtual Wonder Woman who combines brain and skills to deliver the sassy goods to the group. These two have wonderful chemistry together, two leaders who incite a rebellion of imagination, accomplishing it with grace that many young actors fail to deliver. Ben Mendelsohn makes a good villain as well, a corporate wannabe who has only the eyes for cash and lacks the brains to go with the brash.World Creating/Visuals: No surprise here, Spielberg's team invested a lot of time bringing the world to life. Ready Player One's visuals are stunning, taking the imagination of Cline's book and making it pop to life on screen. The various planets all have dynamic visuals to bring each one to life, with exciting, pristine villas grounded by the rugged battlefields of volcanoes. The real world of a future dystopian society is nicely created with their settings and with direction meshes well with our heroes' journey through the cyberspace. And as for the characters themselves, the team managed to recreate the various pop culture references in fantastic design but adding its own twist to correlate with the movie. The heroes have that video game feel, immersing you further into the virtual reality setting as if you were part of the rebellion.The Action: The trailers promised action, and by George did it deliver... on most of the movie. Ready Player One starts strong with some action-packed sequences where racing and FPS/Third Person battles reign supreme. The theater shakes with the intensity and brings a promise that the rest of the movie is going to be just as fun. The rest of the sequences semi-deliver on this promise, primarily the final battle that has some incredible parts. Nonetheless, Spielberg's department did a bang-up job bringing the rush that video games bring, primarily the selling point for seeing it in the theater.The Nostalgia/Reference Hunting: However, the biggest selling point for me was the thrill of hunting down all the cultural Easter eggs/icons that they paid a fortune to portray. My eyes were busy seeking everything crammed in this movie, trying to see which 80's icons made the cut. While 80% are video game references, you'll find various movie, television, and song references shading the oasis, most cleverly brought in to bring life to the scenes in a meaningful way. I'll admit, the replay value of this movie comes in trying to track down everything hidden, like the Easter egg prize they are all seeking. The key demographic of this movie is going to be the fans, nerds, and gamers, as their eager eyes will enjoy seeing their favorites come together to battle the corrupt evil at hand.DISLIKES:The Lack of Challenge: Let's get this settled, the movie is not the book, and to be fair a movie about the actions of the book might have been duller to the general audience. However, the movie could have taken a page for challenging puzzles and cultural integration, because it didn't quite execute this component as well. Most of the quests for the key were diluted compared to brainteasing nightmares of the novel, that could have involved more research and diving than what we got. In addition, some of the solutions were a little more like backdoor cheats than true solutions to the impasses at hand.Character Development: I agree again with my fellow reviewers that the character development suffered a bit as well. Parzival and Art3mis get some decent backstories and growth, but the other characters are sort of thrown into the movie like hamburgers on a flat top. They have those moments that sizzle, only to quickly become fully cooked and dropped back into the background. Even worse, the legendary skills that were boasted in the book/movie are not really delivered for our supporting cast, such a shame really. Not the worst character use, but also not what I had expected.More Action: Surprise, surprise, Robbie wants more action. Ready Player One's scenes are incredible at times, almost as if we have visors on our heads and living the game. The problem for me is... they were too short at times and didn't feel complete for me. I didn't feel this too much until near the middle of the movie when the film hit a slow snag and could have used one or two battles to liven it up. However, the biggest thing I wanted, was seeing the millions of dollars of references used more than the fleeting glances we got. The moves done were cool but watching Parzival and crew work together with the iconic game crew rather than background noise would have been nice.I-ROk: This character wasn't utilized much in the book, so seeing him mentioned in the credits was a surprise. Sadly, they didn't do much with this character, to the point where he was almost not needed. The gaming community knows about epic hunters, villains, and rogues, but this movie failed to deliver on those grounds, instead getting a sarcastic flop. While the main villain was expected to be a rather incompetent jerk, his prized mercenary should have had a little more bite to back things up. Perhaps then the epic climax might have worked a little better, well that and maybe foregoing the van chase at the end... that wasn't needed as much.The VERDICT:Ready Player One the movie is not the book, and the purists who want that book to real life are going to be disappointed with the changes that were made to liven it up. However, Spielberg's take on the film works in regards to action, visuals, and giving us the ultimate finder book of geek references. While the story needed some more wit and character development, the main tweaks needed to be using more of their merchandizing, more of their characters, and pushing their villains to be more. Had these elements been more explored, it would have given this movie more of the finesse it was looking for. Still, this adventure deserves a theater run given the special effects.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.5

another masterpiece of Steven Spielberg,"A great movie needs a great story and Ready Player One has it. If you add to this astounding CGI and tons of well known characters from popular movies or games then you will obtain an amazing movie. Steven Spielberg, who is already renown for E.T. (1982), War of the Worlds and Jurassic Park series - I mentioned only couple of his Sci-Fi movies, took the Earth again by surprise in 2018. The movie script is good too although some people complained that the book is better. Also Ready Player One has a powerful message for it's addressing one of the problems that humankind has it right now: people spend to much time in VR or on social media.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great film,"Just seen an a preview and thoroughly enjoyed. Haven't read the books and only knew a little about the film. Would definitely recommend watching in it 3D. Great special effects, bit of humour and a great film. 2hrs 20 mins so a long waych but doesn't drag at all",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg fantasy fueled by nostalgia. A blast of pop culture powered sequences.,"A whimsical slice of sci-fi adventure. Reasonable acting and the polished visuals we all expect from Spielberg. I suspect I would have given it less stars if I wasn't fond of the 80s and 90s childhood experience. For better or worse the film draws extensively on childhood tropes and memories of that era. I think it would be a solid film without that notstalgia, but if that is your flavour of childhood wonder, you'll really enjoy Ready Player One. The acting overall was okay. The villain was vanilla and I am not sure the script gives the emotional range needed for the protagonists to shine. What the film does do right though is that it is emmersive and fun. Oasis is believable and the rules of this not so far away future internally work, well enough at least. The visuals are pretty and can go way over the top without being disruptive to the flow and tempo of the movie. It spoils little to say the movie is basically watching an 80s video game unfold. This combined with a thorough PG tone maybe limits the film's emotional pay off but I think it just made it more fun. This is movie that did fun well. A worthwhile watch and highly recommended for anyone whose inner child craves a flash back to their favourite 80s and 90s nostalgia.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Intense CGI Done Well,"This was cool at the cinema in 3D. I love the world created within The Oasis, the CGI is at times intense and beautifully rendered. The giant mix of characters is really cool, I wish there were more - like the X-Men, Terminator, Aliens and Predators, etc. The Shinning scene is one of my favourite scenes, it's funny as hell. I can't wait for a real VR experience like this.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazingly fun adaptation,"First of all, why is there so many reviews here only complaining about the movie being very different from the book? I don't think there has ever been a movie adaptation of a book that doesn't change the source material. Even though this movie is, admittedly, one of the more different adaptations I have seen, did you guys really expect it to be exactly like the book? Anyways, Ready Player One is an experience I enjoyed immensely. It's not perfectly written, but the action, editing, and special effects make up for it's flaws. The large amount of references and in this movie work even better on the big screen than they do in a book, in my opinion. I honestly feel that most of the changes from the book were necessary to help the story translate better into a movie. Overall, this is an extremely fun movie that I definitely recommend, especially to kids at heart and fans of the book. (Well, ones that are fine with the movie being way different.) The book was better, but this wasn't bad either. I would totally watch this again.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Good one time watch,I've not read the book so cannot compare with it.

Ready Player One is one of Steven Spielberg's best films in decades,"Ready Player One, a Steven Spielberg adaptation of the sci-fi novel, is an action film that takes place in Columbus, Ohio, and a virtual playground called the Oasis. The film follows Wade Watts (played by Tye Sheridan) as he searches for an Easter egg hidden by the creator of the Oasis, James Halliday (played by Mark Rylance). VR-obsessed humans in the real world are on the hunt for the Egg, which could grant them control of the Oasis and wealth. The fast-paced action keeps the film exciting, with the corporate villains led by Noal Sorrento (played by Ben Mendelsohn) aiming to control the Oasis for money. Wade initially joins the hunt for the love of the game and admiration for Halliday, but his knowledge of Halliday is his biggest asset in finding the keys. This leads to Halliday becoming one of the most interesting characters in Ready Player One, even if he is already dead. The performances in Ready Player One are strong, with some awkward emotional close-ups on Sheridan and overly stiff Hannah John-Kamen. Character animations and voice acting are spot on, with some muddled audio mixing causing lines to get lost in the fantastic score. The movie features explosive car chases and shootouts, making some big action moments unforgettable. Visual effects are impressive, playing with scale, movement, gravity, and time seamlessly. Spielberg uses the full extent of unmatched creativity in a largely animated movie, with careful camera placement and clear communication of every part of the Oasis, making it feel like a fully-realized character of its own. Ready Player One is a brilliant movie that uses pop-culture Easter eggs to create an iconic setting and introduce a character who has never seen it before. The movie combines familiar elements with its own uncertain world of creative action, making it both satisfying and exciting to watch. The horror sequence is built on a successful cameo, which is important to the plot rather than a one-off gag. Most of the other cameos serve no purpose other than getting easy laughs or a proud nod from someone who might recognize them when others don't. Examples include Batman's Harley Quinn acting as someone's player avatar, a fictional weapon being used during a fight, or just a throwaway line of dialogue. While the movie is charmed by its pop-culture references and pseudo-pride at growing up with nerdy interests celebrated in Spielberg's movie, it seems that the real world is not properly established. The movie's fast, smooth, and satisfying experience resembles some of Spielberg's earlier works like Jaws or Jurassic Park, without the building sense of dread. Ready Player One is a film that focuses on the world of Oasis, a dystopian society in 2045. However, the movie neglects to explore the real-world aspects of the Oasis, such as the addiction to the technology, the income generated within the Oasis, and the effects of this extreme tech obsession. The set design and art direction are impressive, but the plot often returns to the real world, leaving the viewer underwhelmed. Characters' backstories are mostly background decorations, with characters like Wade Watts serving no purpose and not contributing to any arc. The movie lacks depth and development, valuing teamwork and people for who they are in the real world. However, the movie is genuinely funny from start to finish, with jokes that never linger too long. One of the movie's biggest successes is its ability to avoid taking itself too seriously. It hits cheesy territory a few times, but mostly knows how to make fun of things the book has been criticized for taking too seriously. Some of the best jokes are made by cutting between real-world events and how they influence the game world. The use of physical comedy, even when animated, ties neatly into the action-packed hero's journey, keeping Ready Player One moving at a thrilling pace.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another good movie from Spielberg,"A gorgeous fantasy action movie from Spielberg, which in itself is almost a big reference. The idea is interesting, its implementation is at a height, which is what the fans needed, the film touches on many important topics for talking about society and human life.It looks in one go - dynamic and not meaningless.The characters open up gradually, because here we are put in the place of main character, who does not know what his comrades look like, and in general, many people here know each other from the game, and not in reality.Of course, I advise you, this film made a great impression on me, not a masterpiece - but a very high-quality creation.My Rating : 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pretty great but had some downs,I loved the start of the movie. I thought everything was set up so well and everything made me really excited for what was to come. However as the movie progressed i felt like the plot became a bit of a mess. I felt like it was all over the place because they had so many characters and so much was going on at the same time. I loved the characters that they had though but i believe they over did it and it couldve been simpler and better. The oasis as a whole seems very cool and i loved the graphics and all of that associated with it. Most of it was fine however that plot ruined it a bit for me.

Love this movie,"Ready Player One is an absolute masterpiece, and I absolutely love it! Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film perfectly blends action, adventure, and nostalgia into a thrilling cinematic experience. The visual effects are nothing short of stunning, bringing the vibrant, immersive world of the OASIS to life in a way that feels truly epic.The story is engaging from start to finish, with Tye Sheridan delivering a fantastic performance as Wade Watts, a relatable and determined hero. The movie's balance of heart-pounding action and a deep love for pop culture makes it a joy to watch for both gamers and movie lovers alike. Every scene is packed with Easter eggs, iconic characters, and references, making it a dream come true for fans of all things pop culture.What truly elevates Ready Player One is the sense of adventure and wonder. Spielberg's direction perfectly captures the spirit of the source material while adding his own magical touch, making the movie not just visually spectacular but emotionally resonant as well.For me, this movie hits all the right notes-action-packed, visually stunning, and full of heart.

"An ok trip down memory lane, but nothing new","Yet another video game nostalgia movie. This time we have a virtual world and the world is a ugly place so everyone plays. Nothing new, its been done before in movies, anime, and books. A group of kids hunt for an easter egg inside of the most popular game on the planet (or so it seems). They have to outsmart, and outwit adults and big corporations as they search for the magic egg that gives the finder control and major ownership of the game. We have kiddie romance, murder, and all sort of stuff along the way but that is about it. I laughed exactly once during the Terminator 2 scene but honestly, the movie was not funny and the CGI action was not particularly impressive if you are a gamer already.

The quests for the keys follow different puzzles/mini-storylines, and there are other changes. The changes do not take away from fundamental enjoyment of the story - it is a fun trip down 80's memory lane. I had the sense that Ernest Cline and Steven Spielberg purposely made the changes to be able to reference even more 80's trivia that appealed to them and any movie fan. If Cline could have included every trivia reference that he had probably wanted to include, the book would have been twice as long. He was able to play with these other 80's memories by working with Spielberg. Finally, this movie is reminiscent of the original Spielberg movies we grew up with - fun times!!!

I'd like to add I read the book before seeing the film and my friend saw the film before reading the book and we both came to pretty much the same conclusion, both the book and the film are fantastically entertaining and neither devalues the other, this is partly because pop culture is by its very definition so vast and diverse that it would be extremely rare for any individual to have both understood and enjoyed every reference made in either the book or film so both mediums have something for everyone, also, given some of the books content and structure it's plainly obvious why it could never have survived the transition to the silver screen intact, time constraints are a big factor and the budget required for the film is another huge one. Maybe the biggest reason for it's successful transition under its unusual circumstances is the collaboration between the author of the novel and director of the movie in writing the screen play together, probably always on the cards given they are both capable, seasoned screen writers but undoubtedly played a big part in its success.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Adventure With A Lot To Say,"Yes it wasn't 100% faithful to the book, but boy it was quite an adventure that had much to say about our current times. You should know the plot by now, if you don't, watch the trailer. I went into it thinking it was going to be another questionable book movie, but I was pleasantly surprised to see how much it had to say bout our society and humanity. Other than the obvious one of our interest in video games because of our disappointing lives. But more than that it discusses things like the use of micro-transactions that ruin peoples financial situations, why we cherish friends or significant others even though we only know them on the internet and have never met them, and many other things. So this is classic sci-fi in the sense that it has something to say about our current society and culture.And about the inaccuracies to the book, there weren't to many, and I won't elaborate so I wont spoil anything, but honestly the inaccuracies didn't really take away from the film like many other times in book adaptations or remakes. The special effects were obviously beautiful and I was visually dazzled the entire time. The problem with most CGI orgies like Marvel movies and many others, is they lack the story to make it great, and thankfully this film did not fall into this category. It retains spectacular visuals while still maintaining a good story to keep you at least mildly engaged. I came for the visual effects, and left with a surprising feeling that it was much more than that. Some of the humor in it was hit and miss, some I laughed at, and some I rolled my eyes and felt it was lame, but again it doesn't take away from the experience.Would definitely recommend it, even to purists who read the book.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Ready Player One - Its good, and that's okay.","Steven Spielberg is one of the biggest directors in Hollywood. He has made numerous films ranging from Jaws to Jurrasic Park.

The creator died and said whoever found his Easter egg after collecting three keys will inherit his fortune.

An Entertaining film but with a few little issues,"Overall, Ready Player One is a fun and entertaining watch. The visuals are stunning and couple that with the various pop culture reference that are present throughout the film and you've got a recipe that sure will satisfy audiences.

Also there are too many cheesy and OTT moments that spoil the momentum of the film. But this is a decent film that I may like more on a second viewing.Quote - 'She wanted to go dancing, so we watched a movie.' - HallidayRating - 3.5/5.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A credible Science Fiction Epic,","Ready Player One: It opens with a washed out filter scene of stacked mobile homes and portacabins. 18 year old wade Watts (Tye Sheridan) descends by rope from his aunt's home, passing many people in VR goggles gaming away. This is a society without hope, pollution, climate change and economic crashes have produced a dystopian world. Wade's parents died in the aftermath of a cataclysmic cyber event when many systems failed.The only escape is through the online VR world, OASIS. Within that universe there is a game Anorak's Quest, invented by the late creator of OASIS, James Halliday. The goal is to find three keys and thereby win the ""Easter Egg"" which will earn the winner half a trillion dollars and full ownership of OASIS. Wadeis Parzival in the game and has friends and fellow competitors such as Samantha/Art3mis (Olivia Cook) and Helen/Aech (Lena Walthe).But there is also Nolan Sorrento (Ben Mendelsohn), the CEO of Innovative Online Industries, who seeks full control over the OASIS. IOI is a video game conglomerate and manufactures most of the VR equipment used to access the OASIS. Sorrento has amassed an army of debt-indentured gamers to seek the keys.Similar to Blade Runner in some aspects, run-down cities, economic/environmental collapse but differing in an absence of androids and most of the action occurring in VR. There are many cultural references, ranging from the gamers having to fight King Kong and Jurassic Park style dinosaurs to the Iron Giant battling Mechagodzilla.There is also a game sequence set in The Shining where , Aech encounters the Twins and is drenched by the blood filled lift.Coin earned in the OASIS not only allows gamers to build equipment and artifacts in VR but may also be used in the real world. Being killed online has serious consequences in both worlds as it reduces the gamers status and holdings to zero. ""Dead"" gamers even attempt suicide.The evil IOI Corporation looks somewhat like the Scientologists. Slave-labour gamers in it's Loyalty Centres whilst planners/researchers wear suits and ties. It's Security Chief (Hannah John-Kamen) is suitably ruthless like a higher level SeaOrg Hubbardite. Evil and cruel but not pantomime villain depraved.Steven Spielberg has directed and produced a credible Science Fiction epic, scripted by the novel author Ernest Cline (with Zak Penn) with many filters and hues by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski.

"A movie that manages to collect most of the pop and nerd culture from the 80's, until today","I did not read the book, so unfortunately I cannot compare the source material to the cinematic adaptation.The CGI sequences were really well made and as a fellow gamer, I have to say that were really immersive and it seemed to be really watching people playing. OASIS is stunning: the art direction is really good, locations are very well made, fights scenes are intense. This is exactly what I was expecting from a movie of this kind. The story is intriguing with interesting plot twists that will mix together the virtual and real words together. Even if the plot is not the most original one, the way it is narrated is different than the average Hollywood action movie. ""Ready Player One"" manages to collect references to pop and gaming culture, starting from the 80s, until today: more or less 40 years in one single movie.After many attempts from Hollywood to create movies inspired from video games (like Resident Evil), that failed miserably, this one seems to be the real first movie related to games that aims perfectly to the objective: be entertaining, funny and have a good story.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Movie Review: Ready Player One,"This is definitely a Spielberg film which is probably it's biggest strength. In the 1st act Spielberg shows fantastic understanding of makes an action sequence exiting as well as how how to successfully use the references that are scattered around the film. The 3rd act is ""pure Spielberg magic"" as the poster reads and it does have the unique feeling of watching Spielberg at his best. My problem however is with the 2nd act, this is a long movie and it feels it length due to some very long scenes of characters talking within the real world. These real world scenes are handled well enough but compared to the incredibly action packed and existing scenes within the OASIS they drag and are honestly quite boring at points. Much like the tone, the performances are also uneven. Stand outs would be Olivia Cooke as one of the players within the OASIS her performance being genuinely charismatic and likeable and Ben Mendelsohn as a the corporate bad guy. The weakest performance in my opinion has to be from T.J. Miller whose performance seems based solely on the fact that you are already supposed to like him and for me his whole thing is getting pretty old. Overall this is an entertaining enough popcorn flick. It's not one to think too hard over and there are some genuinely entertaining scenes. The references are pretty fun if you like that kind of thing (some personal favourites involved nods to Child's Play, The Iron Giant and The Shining). It's definitely uneven but it's still fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Near Perfection. As Wonderful as Free Guy if not Better,"Movie Review: Ready Player One
The film ""Ready Player One"" is a Stephen Spielberg film. Apparently, he's still got it. He stated that this film was one of the hardest to make out of all his films. It does have tens of thousands of special effects and digital wizardry. An entire virtual world shows up on screen and you feel like you are living inside the world's coolest video game.I totally loved the film ""Free Guy"" which also has a virtual world complete with artificial intelligence, and a great story in the real world and within the virtual world. Free Guy is one of my favorite films of all time, mainly because it is much more than great sci fi, it is super funny.People who loved Free Guy kept comparing it to Ready Player One, saying both were equally great, so I finally found the time to see it. It is free on On-Demand via TNT, but that version comes with commercials. To ensure nothing got edited out, I rented it from WB in order to see it complete and commercial-free. I am sure some of the film's sensual scenes were removed on the TNT version.What is great about the cast is that they are not overly beautiful or perfect-looking people in real life. They are attractive but in a normal, average way. The cast is also about as diverse as it gets, as pretty much all ethnicities and racial groups are represented by the good guys and heroes. On the other hand, all the avatars in the film are radical and cool.The movie has super-bad bad guys along with super humane everyman good guys. The film makes you cheer at times, and cry at others possibly. It also has a near-perfect ending.Although two hours and 20 minutes long, it never dragged and my attention never waned. Every scene, every dialogue seemed necessary and forwarded the plot. The script was flawless.The film is based on a famous novel which I have not read. It might be fun to read the novel after seeing the movie, and not vice versa; as readers of the book thought the movie was not nearly as good.The best thing about the movie is that it contains references and visuals to all the games, monsters, superheroes, and TV Shows and Movies of yesteryear, the 70s, 80s, 90s along with providing the music from all those decades. In the film, there is Batman, Godzilla, King Kong, Chuckie the Doll, and dozens if not hundreds of other characters and visuals. In fact, the film needs to be seen two or three times to take it all in as they throw the kitchen sink at you often.I would say that Free Guy was a lot funnier than this movie, but Ready Player One was more thrilling and suspenseful, and more of a roller coaster ride; but actually, they are both equally perfect.Check out Ready Player One on Comcast On Demand in the free movie listing, but choose to rent it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

As a movie: Great job; as an adaptation: Great Crap,"As a person that read the book AFTER watching the movie adaptation, I was not that dissapointed with the film.
The book was incredible and in my opinion far better than the movie, but this doesn´t means that the movie wasn´t good just not in the same way that the book.
The film misses lots of details that were in the original READY PLAYER ONE and the main plot that even though I know it isn´t always possible to recreate the book, i think that Spielberg had a lot of resources that he did not use; whith and argument as ashtonishing as the book has with lot of juicy parts that he coud have included.
I read the book because I thought that the movie was really great, when i finished after two days of intense reading i watched the movie again and i couldn´t see more connection with the book than the names of the characters and the main idea. Despite the fact that the movie has a lot to be jelaouse from the book, it is not a bad film is just that after you read the book you don´t see where the movie came from.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spielberg Magic with the Novel's Vision,"Although I loved the book, one shouldn't judge the two because they are different in their own right. With Ernest Cline writing the screenplay, his vision for Ready Player One is still preserved and, with Spielberg's help, is simply modified to fit a wider spectrum of audiences. If you decide to watch the movie (which I highly recommend), be ready for changes made, yet despite them, just embrace the pure magic that this movie has created, and the Ready Player One essence we've come to love will stay majorly untainted.Visually the film is stunning, and I think it might be a step beyond what we have seen for visual effects in movies up to this point.This movie is very important because it bridges the gap between the video game world with modern culture in many different ways, and by replacing some elements less-suitable for the big screen like the Joust match or the angst-filled search for the keys, the movie became much more enjoyable for a wider audience.About the issue of non-80's culture being added into the movie, it might displease some but it is necessary for the newer generations to visually relate and connect with the movie in similar ways that the previous generation can connect with the 80's references.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ready Player One,"A good film yet underwhelming film saved mostly by Spielberg's direction and fine performances by Olivia Cook and Ben Mendelsohn.

"Mostly enjoyed it, but I also wasn't overly thrilled.","'READY PLAYER ONE': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new sci-fi adventure from director Steven Spielberg, and based on the book (of the same name) by Ernest Cline. The film is set in a future where virtual reality is commonly used to escape the depression of the real world. A very skilled teenager competes to win control over the virtual universe, with the help of his new friends, while an evil businessman desperately tries to win control over it too. The movie was scripted by Cline and Zak Penn (who also co-wrote such other blockbuster sci-fi flicks as 'THE AVENGERS', 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', 'X-MEN 2', 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND' and 'LAST ACTION HERO'). It stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance. The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also expected to be a hit at the Box Office as well. I mostly enjoyed it, but I also wasn't overly thrilled.The story is set in the year 2044, when most of the planet's population lives in poverty. They escape depression by doing most of their daily activities in a virtual reality world, called the OASIS. In this world they can be whoever they want to be, but when their avatar dies they lose everything they have, and they have to start over with nothing. The creator of OASIS, the late James Halliday (Rylance), has left behind a game challenge, in which the winner gains complete control over the virtual reality world. A corrupt businessman, named Nolan Sorrento (Mendelsohn), will do anything to win control. A teenager named Wade Watts (Sheridan), and his new rebel ally friends, will do anything to stop him.The movie has elements of classic Spielberg adventure films in it, but it also lacks a lot of the heart and magic that made those movies so special. Spielberg tries to recapture those strengths in this film, but he's just not able to ever do it. The effects are pretty cool, but they also make the world and characters of the movie seem very distant. The characters also don't seem very developed or truly relatable. Still, technically speaking, the movie is pretty visually flawless , and it's also a lot of fun to see all of these classic movie and video game characters in one film together (but you get that just from watching the trailer). The third act is also really long and uninvolving for the most part too. I liked the film overall, to an extent, but it definitely doesn't live up to Spielberg's greatest work.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Mr Cline...WHY?!,"MOVIEGOERS: If you read the book READY PLAYER ONE I can't recommend seeing the movie , but if you do I'll see you in the comments lamenting with the rest of us...Mr Cline: I read your book from cover to cover, loved it, and greatly anticipated the movie. Watching READY PLAYER ONE was difficult because the storytelling felt rushed, most of the 80's references are missing, there are gaps in the plot, and MAJOR characters roles are changed, the screenplay barely resembled the book and it leaves me wondering how you thought your readers would enjoy this vastly different storyline. I respect the process of adapting a book for the screen. It's hard work and not everyone will agree with what you keep and what you cut. It's hard to understand what you did or let Spielberg and Penn do to the movie. The disparity between what I saw on screen and what I read in your book was shocking. I was slack jawed and left scratching my head the whole 2 hours and 20 minutes because I couldn't keep up with all the changes!I am assuming that getting the rights to use all the 1980's music and movie references from the book would have been exorbitantly expensive, even downright impossible, but why make a movie that drops out so much of what made the book great? It's like you rearranged the furniture in a comfy and familiar room, then shut off the lights and placed the characters inside to fumble and trip all over the place.I feel so sad saying I dislike the movie because I had high hopes!P.S.

Just to be fair,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Ready Player One. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of video games most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Parzival's optimistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from the video game series Final Fantasy, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Ready Player One truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Parzival's existencial catchphrase ""You're full of shit"" which itself is a cryptic reference to Activision's video game epic Call Of Duty. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Steven Spielberg's genius unfolds itself on their theater screens.

A Sarcastic Romp Through Virtual Reality,"Watching Ready Player One is like stepping into a neon-soaked time machine set to the '80s, with a generous sprinkling of futuristic gadgetry. Directed by Steven Spielberg, this flick whisks you away to a dystopian future where people spend more time in a virtual universe called the OASIS than dealing with their real-world problems. And let's face it, with the way things are going, I wouldn't blame them.Our hero, Wade Watts, aka Parzival, embarks on a quest to find a hidden Easter egg within the OASIS left by its eccentric creator, James Halliday. It's like a digital scavenger hunt on steroids, with pop culture references coming at you faster than you can say ""nostalgia overload"". The OASIS is a CGI wonderland, filled to the brim with iconic characters, vehicles, and landscapes from every corner of geekdom. It's like a geek's dream come true, assuming their dream involves dodging virtual obstacles and battling evil corporate types. But beyond the flashy effects and endless references to '80s pop culture, Ready Player One does have a heart buried beneath all the pixelated madness. It's about friendship, courage, and the importance of disconnecting from your digital life once in a while to actually live.Sure, the plot might be a tad predictable, and some of the characters feel like they were pulled straight from a video game cliché handbook. But if you're looking for a fun, action-packed ride through a virtual wonderland with a healthy dose of sarcasm thrown in, Ready Player One might just be your ticket to geek paradise.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Only reality is real,"One of the biggest problems of this kind of video game movie is that I can't feel nervous in this process.

Several clues are found by patting the head. A group of talented players who have won the starting line in the beginning have no imagination in the plot. I think if we don't have these one or two hundred eggs to distract the audience, the movie will be called a brainless idiot, right? Eggs will bring some fun to a movie, but if the movie itself is an egg, I don't know whether it should be called cleverness or speculation.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Points for degree of difficulty,"Like ""The Girl on the Train"" and any Dan Brown book exactly what makes Ernst Cline's novel excellent makes for a just decent cinematic experience. The novel engages in dense and luxurious world-building and an intricate puzzle-box plot which unfolds degree-by-degree. By necessity of their compressed run-times, movies need to get through the set up (unless you are M. Night Shyalaman whose films constitute mostly setup). The medium limits the plot points to only a few switchbacks (again unless you are M. Night Shyalaman and you put all your switchbacks into a one big reveal). The limitations present headwinds that Spielberg takes a mighty swing at slipping but with limited success. The film's key draw, as you would expect, come from Spielberg's immersive and imaginative visuals and not from the rushed plot or flat performances. The motion picture also provides nostalgic value to those of a certain age through dozens of visual references (""there's 'Bigfoot', the king of the monster trucks back in the 80s!""). In short, to misquote the immortal words of the Gin Blossoms, if you don't expect too much, you might not be let down"".",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Press Start to Continue...,"Steven Spielberg's new nostalgia laden flick ""Ready Player One"" hit theatres this past weekend and I was there. If someone is going to whip up a nostalgia flick, who better to do it than the 'Berg himself? He is the REASON for movie nostalgia, having churned out a string of 80's hits including E.T. (1982), Poltergeist* (1982), and Gremlins (1984), amongst others. Ready Player One, in my humble opinion, did not disappoint.Set in 2045 in a dystopian Ohio, Ready Player One follows the story of Wade Watts, a teenage gamer who spends most of his waking moments (like the rest of society) in a virtual world called the OASIS. OASIS is a virtual game world created by eccentric gaming pioneer James Halliday, touted as the new ""Steve Jobs"". The story gives us the back history of Halliday's creation, and how it started as a passion project, quickly to become extremely successful and then threatened by corporate greed. Halliday then passes away, but before doing so, offers a challenge to OASIS users - find the three keys using ""easter eggs"" left behind by Halliday himself, and the kingdom is yours.Enter Wade Watts and his band of merry misfits, a series of friends he plays along with in the virtual world, knowing them only by their virtual avatars and pseudonyms. Combine a journey for the keys, teenage heartstrings, a corporate villain, quirky comedy, nods to nostalgia, eye popping visuals and a mind blowing homage to Stanley Kubrick, and you've got the thrill ride that is Ready Player One.While I find the overuse of CGI trying at times in newer movies, it fits here due to the subject matter at hand. You can't have a virtual world like this without CG, and the production team did a great job of flipping between reality and the virtual world, while maintaining continuity. I did see the movie 3D and I think it worked nicely to pull the viewer into the story - it was used properly and didn't feel gimmicky at all.Story wise, there isn't much new here formula wise - you'll see what I mean when you watch it. I think the producers understood this and added some elements of mystery that work quite nicely. In some respects, you are playing the game right alongside the characters, which is fun and thrilling at the same time.Overall, Ready Player One is a fun family film that earns it PG-13 rating for some mild sexual references and violent video game action scenes, but is definitely worth the experience (and will be joining my movie library). 8/10.*yah yah Tobe Hooper blah blah",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Not only does The Shining NOT have anything to do with 80's culture, and is NOT featured prominently in the book like ""War Games"" and other 80's movies, it also has NOTHING to do with Gaming.

Amazon Prime.Ready player one had been in my watchlist for a long time when I finally decided to watch it. Having my friends always glorified how awesome the film is, I shall say that I was not disappointed.We have a futuristic setup in which VR has replaced the reality of life, where most of the people from kids to elders are invested in a game, that has a challenge, that when completed by one of the players, comes up with an enormous amount of wealth and power. The stakes are at high and results in a rigorous battle between the corporates (who would love the sieze the game) and the common men (who are passionate about the game).Ready player one didn't blow my mind in any way but rather I would say it a well crafted feel good film. It is fast paced, has diverse characters, the animators have done an incredible job and of all the above, the plot and the screenplay make sense and are pretty solid.All the factors that would make a film interesting and loveable are all here. There are no reasons on why you shouldn't watch the film. Go for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Book better/ Movie is a cartoon,"Like everyone else who read the book, I was very disappointed. Things were changed that didn't need to be. The movie itself was okay but was at least half a cartoon, so be ready. Someday someone will remake this movie following the book.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Willy Wonka and the internet.,"This really is an action packed, spot the movie reference version of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
Dead eccentric James Halliday leaves three keys hidden in a massive virtual world. The person who gets all three will get an 'Easter egg' giving him or her the right to control the Oasis.
The Oasis is the virtual world everyone escapes to in a desolate future. Meet Wade Watts who is our Charlie Bucket. Along with his rag tag group of fellow players, he will race the greedy and corrupt corporation run by Nolan Sorrento to control the Oasis.
It's an unchallenging action film that is eminently rewatchable because of the ludacris number of pop culture cameos. From King Kong to Knight Rider, from the Cyclops from the Ray Harryhausen Sinbad movies to Monty Python via Halo and Akira, you could spend days watching this to spot the references.
Fun entertainment and while not particularly challenging it's definitely worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Steven Spielberg can handle any subject,"Steven Spielberg is the real hero of this movie. One might think his recent movies are not up to date or not trendy enough, but those doubts are squashed.Cons:
I felt that the story/narration is a bit underwhelming. What started as a classic, eventually the movie fell short.Pros:
A virtual reality film with decent acting. A must watch, at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Superficially made adventure with some nice action sequences,"The biggest problem this movie has is the following: it's been made for the audiences younger than twenty, but heavily relies on culture elements many in that age group won't be able to understand or notice. Acting, characters and story are forgettable - overall, they lack that characteristic Steven Spielberg charm. I didn't get drawn into the movie, didn't feel as the part of the adventure.Of course, there is some romance, but it's been done rather superficially, not surprisingly since there lacks the character development. It seems to me that story writers couldn't figure out which characters to put emphasis on and develop more fully since OASIS and real world are on screen alternately. Visual effects are among the best I've seen.If you only want to see a two hour adventure without expecting any level of sophistication, go and check it out, especially if you have 4DX cinema near you.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Imperfect perfection,"The master of playing the heartstrings of nostalgia does it again. I wanted to immediately watch it again after 10 minutes in. Can't wait to own the Blu-ray but is a must watch on the big screen. I could pick it apart and fill in a few holes in the storyline but would rather enjoy the time traveling escape I just experienced. I can see this as a movie that people would dress up as their favorite video game characters to attend. My only regret is not doing the D-Box seats, perhaps next time! I could see where this could be hard to follow for inexperienced gamers but it touches so many genres and generations that it shouldn't stop anyone from finding joy as they watch. This movie is a energetic masterpiece that sparks the imagination.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Long but good,This movie was really cool and my surround stereo system loved it. It was a bit long and could have been tightenes up a bit.Olivia Cooke is a dime piece in this.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty but awful,"The only reason I can't rate it lower is because it is visually very impressive. The story is forced, dragged out, overdone, cliche, creepy and just poor.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Really good movie nice concept,I wouldn't spoil it for anyone but it's a really great movie I enjoyed every bit of it. The whole concept was really good. A must watch,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Exceeded expectations,"The movie was much better than I have expected. It had solid continuity, the thread of the story did not break, and although it was long - I was not waiting for it to end, just wanted more and more.The characters were well developed, and it was both interesting to see them ""in game"" and in real life. There was quite a good balance between the two as well.Although I thought the movie would appeal more to the younger audiences, I found out that older viewers (e.g. parents) enjoyed watching it too. It's defo one of the movies to be re-watched one day.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Superb fun,"A superb family action adventure movie full of spectacular special effects and tons of video game and pop culture references. Exciting and thrilling, but also heartwarming and comical thanks to the great cast, likeable characters and moral messages. Entertaining throughout, the plot initially seems a bit simple as it follows video game logic, but there's a lot more to it and with something always going on, it's never boring. It's not perfect - the villain is a bit of a letdown and it drags a bit at the end, but it is a visual treat and relatively topical with the ever growing and ever-changing gamer culture.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It May Be Too Long, But It's Loads Of Fun","Come to this with no history or attachment in relation to the novel, and only knowing that a lot of people didn't seem to like this. My own reaction was that it was terrific fun - a total blast. It's too long - overblown - but it looks fantastic, and it's hard to imagine many directors other than Spielberg making this story vaguely coherent and thrilling. The self-referentialism and pop-culture winks are probably too much, but still in a fun sort of way. There are pretty obvious points being made here about tech, big corporations and too much screen time; they're obviousness,, as well as the sense of the film having its cake and eating it in that regard, do not invalidate that it manages to be both fun and have something to say as well. Too much, but I think it's a cold-hearted soul who finds nothing here to enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
