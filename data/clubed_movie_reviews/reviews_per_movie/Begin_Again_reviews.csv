Keira can sing!  Nice feel good movie about music making today,This is a feel good movie about musicians making an album. Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley play producer and song writer who team up to make a demo filmed all over the city. The songs are pleasant and the characters are sympathetic and likable even Hailee Steinfeld as Mark's daughter. There is a nice dynamic between the characters which makes the movie enjoyable to watch. There is almost as much music as a musical but it doesn't feel much like a musical.Who knew Keira could sing so well? She doesn't have the most powerful voice but her singing is musical and right for the type of songs. Mark looks suitably scruffy for the fallen on hard times composer. Nice cameo by Ceelo Green and Adam Levine who sings quite a few songs.Movies like this are pleasant and uplifting to watch - if you want a break from action or violence of summer blockbusters.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Terrific songs, good acting, a nice tonic for troubled times","I was a big fan of ONCE - I did not see BEGIN AGAIN when it first came out and only recently watched it and I loved it. One must be in the right mood for this winning, open hearted film - it can be easily passed over as sappy or sentimental but I thought the story of two damaged people meeting each other at just the right time - to be there to help one another - is very well done and Knightley and Ruffalo are wonderful together. But what really makes the whole package work is the fantastic songs - many people were involved with the writing of the music - including Carney the writer-director but the main person behind the songs is Gregg Alexander - a very underrated, very talented musician who was the band The New Radicals in the 90's. He has a way of writing catchy melodies and Lost Stars is a marvelous song - I think my fav scene though is when they are on the rooftop and crank out that song w/ Ruffalo jamming with his daughter. Brought a smile and a tear. I'm a sucker for Carney's films because I also loved SING STREET!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't judge a book...,"John Carney is one of the few people working in movies today whose next work I am always eager to see. Along with a few others such as Richard Linklater, he has proved to me that you can take a premise which has been explored many times before and view it from a different perspective to create something that feels original and fresh. His previous work 'Once' did this and is among my favourite films.Suffice to say, when I saw the trailer for Begin Again it simply did not grab me. My first worry was that it looked 'too Hollywood' (read as 'cliche and predictable movie churned out to make money with little care or thought for the story it is telling'). I felt a little worried going in to see the film that somehow Mr. Carney had fallen foul of the big producers, making sacrifices to the story in order to get some 'names' into it.However, around 20 minutes in, my hopes returned and I knew it was going to be special... and it just got better from there. the film builds on the story and characters as it goes on, making me care about them, showing me things I had never seen before in similar movies and above all, making me think. As the credits rolled, I was wiping my eyes, partly from the wonderful soundtrack but mostly because Begin Again is a magical film. It still has the 'spark' that I felt in his previous pictures, a huge amount of love, passion and care that has brought it into being - not just a half baked idea thrown out there to pay back impatient investors. The soundtrack, performances and well-crafted script took me on an emotionally rewarding journey, leaving me feeling inspired, uplifted and a little nostalgic for times gone by. yep, I am gushing, but it really is going to be hard to beat for film of the year for me.Between the scenes, I also loved how it discreetly touched on some important issues with throwaway lines, addressing things which people take for granted these days: 'Music is for the ears, not the eyes.' and 'don't dress like you are easy' being two of them. Image is so ingrained into art these days, the majority of people all seem to judge a book by it's cover without looking inside. And the same could be said for this film too. On the outside it looks like yet another generic, manufactured Pop Idol... but if you sit down and watch it, I think you will be pleasantly surprised that it has something profound to say and says it well.Thought provoking, life affirming and highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Intelligent, Entertaining, Warm and exciting.","""A movie about modern advances dismantling the art industry as we know it by replacing the high-paid middle-men with IT, bringing artist closer to audience."" Doesn't sound like a thrilling blurb, but this movie brings the story to live with incredible writing, great music, wonderful performances and a brilliant vision. Just like in ""Once,"" this not-love-story side-steps the romance plot Hollywood usually uses like a crutch and focuses on the struggle and triumph or artistic endeavor. (most mainstream stories end with the message that the only happy ending ends in breeding. This tale recognizes the value of humankind's other creative capabilities.) Not that the film's all esoteric and above family. There are all kinds of emotional wounds we suffer in this life, in our families. Rather than a sub-plot focused on starting a family, this story's sub-plot focuses on both growing strong after a family fails (harder) and on repairing another failed family (hardest).And that's all below the point.Music! What wonderful music they used in this film, from the soundtrack to the original performances. The way they bring the performances and the creative process to life - the pain, the joy, the failures and triumphs - is just thrilling. This is the kind of film that will make you want to get up and MAKE STUFF. And then put it out there because you can. You don't need the middle-men anymore. You don't need the industry.To create is the highest expression of humanity and so, perhaps, making art (like this film) that inspires creativity in others is yet a step above.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"A charming, largely effective twist on a tale that's been told many times before.","You've seen it all before. Strictly speaking, Begin Again doesn't have the most original of story lines - movies, specifically romantic comedies and sports movies, have long built their predictable happy endings out of opposites attracting, spinning tales of Disillusioned Person A finding inspiration from Disillusioned Person B, and vice versa. The fact that this film comes with added original music isn't even that much of an innovation - writer-director John Carney did the same thing in Once, his own much-beloved musical romance from 2006. But, for all that, Begin Again remains appealing because it refuses to settle comfortably into any one genre. Funny, dramatic, romantic and platonic, the film navigates its cast of characters with much skill and tenderness.Dan (Mark Ruffalo) is a mess: once a groundbreaking executive of his own indie record label, he's floundering helplessly in a life he no longer recognises. He's alienated his wife Miriam (Catherine Keener) and teenage daughter Violet (Hailee Steinfeld), and his partner Saul (Yasiin Bey a.k.a. Mos Def) has just fired him. Musically-inclined Greta (Keira Knightley) isn't having all that great a time of it either: she moved to New York with her boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine), but he's too busy having his head turned by fame and other girls as he hits the big time. When Dan hears Greta singing in a rundown bar, he resolves to make music with her - even if no one else believes he can do it.When examined in its broadest strokes, Begin Again isn't anything special. There's never any doubt that this story will turn out well, that its protagonists will help each other move out of their dark romantic pasts. Its deliberately quirky-cute plot veers frequently towards the corny and predictable, as Dan and Greta set about making the indie-est of indie albums, guerrilla-style on the streets of New York. Of course they'll meet like-minded, kooky people who help them achieve their goal. And yes, Dan will find a way to bond with Violet in the process, just as Greta figures out just what she wants (or doesn't want) from her relationship with Dave.But Begin Again is a far better film in its details, largely because Carney lavishes a lot of thought, love and hope on his characters. Dan, for one, grows as the film does, the layers of hurt and anger shrouding him and his bad choices slowly peeling away to reveal the damaged soul hiding beneath. There's even something unexpectedly rich about the interaction between Greta and stereotypical bastard boyfriend Dave: he is every bit the jerk he appears on screen, and yet, Carney lends credence to their relationship with some genuinely emotional moments, anchored by a song she writes for him (Lost Stars). Greta's time with Dave, Carney seems to suggest, is not wasted, even if her trust in him might be misplaced. That's an unusually complex thought for a film that's so apparently slight.The way the film ends, too, comes as a welcome surprise. Unlike the more vapid rom-coms for which it might be easily mistaken, Begin Again chooses to focus on a deeper kind of love story. The love that Dan and Greta eventually share is of a pleasingly unique kind - a connection that isn't romantic or, at least, not purely so. They are also friends and kindred spirits: relationships that typically get short shrift the moment a guy and a girl are placed in the same scene together.Having scored a hit with Once, Carney can now afford big-name Hollywood actors. Fortunately, he also chose A-list actors who have quite enough skill and charisma to make the hokier parts of the script work. Ruffalo again manages to lend Dan, a generally rumpled mess of rage, his own innate charm and sweetness. Even at his most reprehensible, Dan - in Ruffalo's hands - feels more like a lost soul than an unforgivable one. Knightley makes up for her less-than-arresting singing voice with her most sympathetic performance in ages. James Corden turns in an amusing performance as Greta's hapless panhandling friend Steve, although Keener - a fine character actress - is robbed of the opportunity to lend Miriam more depth (especially considering a revelation that comes later in the film).Better in its execution than conception, Begin Again is an amiably tough-minded twist on a plot you've seen a thousand times before. The film never really reaches spectacular heights, nor does it re-invent the wheel. But it's a smart, sweet and mostly very effective take on a story that could have been a hundred times more predictable and cloying. That, in itself, is quite the achievement.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Really a pleasant surprise - delightfully not full of cheese!,"I was expecting a cheesy film. I am not into musicals so was hesitant to commit to this film, in a theatre. But, I was pleasantly surprised. I find some of Ruffalos work, like Now you see me, to be hard to sit through. I did not dislike that film, but I hated his performance. Part of it was how vapid the character was. In this film it is the opposite. He is charming, roguish, creative, and delightful to watch. Quite frankly I did not think Knightly was up to this either. Was I ever surprised. She was great. Well written, well directed, and very good overall. In these days of Hollywood losing its edge, and producing more and more low quality, derivative work, it is refreshing to see a film like this one. And I did not even need to use my earplugs. Transformer this film was not. Thankfully.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Loved this movie!,"A few years ago, Mr Shullivan & I went to New York and booked tickets to see 'Once'. Absolutely loved it - the show and the music! We then watched the movie version directed by John Carney - and it was great as well! When we happened to see a clip for 'Begin Again', with John Carney directing, I asked Mr Shullivan to get us this movie to watch at home - and I have no regrets!Enjoyed the music during the film (and we even watched the bonus features on the DVD and I asked Mr. Shullivan to get the soundtrack!). And the music stayed with me even after the movie. I was pleasantly surprised on how much I enjoyed Kiera Knightley's singing as well as her acting performance. And I thoroughly enjoyed both her version of 'Lost Stars' and Adam Levine's!Mark Ruffalo's performance as Dan was great - he showed the range of emotion you'd expect in the part he was playing - a jaded, down in the dumps record executive who gets a turnaround through the movie by his chance meeting with Gretta (Keira Knightley's character).Loved the opening sequences of the movie - showing the same scene from several different character's perspectives - but especially Dan's - when he re-imagines Gretta's song with added instruments and enhanced arrangements. Unique & riveting!And finally, loved the album and film concept of taking it to the streets of New York - very enjoyable and very real!I will want to see this movie again! And any other John Carney films!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
For the love of music.,"I don't love movies that are about music bands. I always get bored of all the scenes where a supposed artist is on stage singing a song to the masses and everybody sings along as if it was a hit, but the song is absolute rubbish. That in itself is enough for me to stop watching a movie.Surprisingly enough, in this movie, they a did a pretty good job with the songwriting. Some of the songs are quite enjoyable, and they make the story a little more believable. But hold on! What story? A girl who gets dumped by her emerging star boyfriend meets an exec guy from the music industry who falls in love with her singing. And they both spend the whole movie recording her songs around NY city to release an album at the end. That's it....if anything else happened, please let me know.I normally take points away for the music, in this case I give points for it. Without the music it would be a 4...",6.0,Anonymous,Music
If music be the food of love,"Once again, Carney wins me.I'll let the other reviewers introduce you to the characters and the plot, I'll just say this -- for me, this is a perfect movie. It took hold of me from the start, took me down to the depths, up to the heights, and never let me go until the last frame. Perfect execution: casting, performances, writing. The actors just nail it, especially Knightley and Ruffalo, though I would have liked to have seen more done with Catherine Keener.I rarely watch movies twice, but there are people I want to share this with, and I ordered the soundtrack as soon as I returned home.How will they finish this, I kept thinking toward the end.

Music Over Substance,"This movie has some great musical scenes, which are the film's best asset, but also the problem.The plot's not that substantial, relationships ending/beginning, with discussions about selling out in the music industry. Nothing new here. Things always perk up when the music starts.Everyone seems to play music really well without any apparent rehearsals. All the characters are cool and have a great rapport with one another. No one's shy about dancing. Could I call this anti-realism?I almost felt someone took a porn script, substituted music for the sex, and made this film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
From the start,"Can a song save your life? Or a film about it? The former question is what the movies title originally was going to be. But lets get back to Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, both of whom are exceptional in this. There is also Adam Levine (he plays sort of a version of himself or what the general public thinks of him and he's doing a great job too) and Catherine Keener.Put this cast together with a really good script, that actually avoids quite a lot of the typical romantic comedy clichés. You genuinely don't know where this is going. It might have to do that this is first a movie about music and then about human love. So it's love for music first and then the rest. It doesn't mean, it doesn't love it's character though. Quite the contrary! They are very nicely drawn, which makes this a very entertaining watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
a splendid date flick for hipsters in the built-up areas,"From Irish director/writer John Carney (also the of the indie dark-horse ONCE (2006, 8/10), BEGIN AGAIN is an urban symphony of NYC, stars two bankable names of Knightley & Ruffalo.Originally titled CAN A SONG SAVE YOUR LIFE?, which is more literal to describe the chance meeting between Dan Mulligan (Ruffalo) and Gretta James (Knightley), Dan is a damaged good, with the usual trappings, a middle-aged man abandoning himself to alcohol, separated with her wife Miriam (Keener) and distanced with their teenage daughter Violet (Steinfeld), once a promising executive of an indie record label, but now he is just fired by his business partner Saul (Bey) in the presence of Violet. It is the worst day of his life, and he is seriously considering to end his own life until he watches Gretta performing her own song in a bar, he is immediately attracted by her unsophisticated frankness in her music, and decides to sign her (although this is not up to him and he brings her to Saul to see if they can reach for a record deal).For Gretta, the day they meet is assumed to be her last day in NYC, the next day she would fly back to Britain, her homeland. She has experienced a breakup with her long-time boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave Kohl (Levine), who has become a big shot in the city and cheated on her. When Saul is hesitate to sign her, Dave proposes a crack idea to live-recording an entire album al fresco, they recruit a band and then record songs in an alley, on a rooftop and various other locations. The two grow closer and a budding romance is appositely honed up when they share each other's personal play-lists while wandering on the street, yet, Carney calmly puts a stop in this corny route through Gretta's realisation that it would only be a fling between them, and obviously Dave is still hankering to reconcile with Miriam and they should be a happy family. Meanwhile, Gretta also needs to figure out the mess with Dave, who is remorseful for his wantonness and intends to win her back after Gretta leaves him a song in his voice-mail. After witnessing Dave's live performance of LOST STARS (Oscar-nominated!), which is written by Gretta, in front of an enchanted audience, she finally has the epiphany that she cannot be a part of Dave's new rock star lifestyle, a painful closure seems to be the right thing to do.Finally, their album is accomplished, but Gretta opts for an alternative distribution circuit, she decides to sell the album in 1$ exclusively through internet, and it turns out to be a smash while Dave and Miriam reconnect their romance. Although the success of the album is a bit implausible and only can happen in a fanciful mind, otherwise the original soundtrack would become a much more sought-after commodity, apparently, one must love the soundtrack to take this film as a guilty pleasure, nevertheless, it is definitely a soothing experience to see Knightley in her most relaxed state against an always-unobjectionable Ruffalo, and it is a splendid date flick for hipsters in the built-up areas - we are all lost stars, a speck of dust within the galaxy, trying to light up the dark.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A refreshing film ...without explosions?,"I knew virtually nothing about this film - hadn't even seen the trailer - when I drug my wife to see it last night, and we were both very pleasantly surprised. The characters are drawn in such a way that they are both like-able and relatable. In the end, the film builds emotion with the audience not by means of incredible stretches of the imagination, but through a gradually reinforced empathy. I have seen all the summer blockbusters, and the single largest failure in most of them is that they create shallow characters that the audience does not care about.The dynamics used in this movie cause an engagement in the audience that is necessary in ANY film for it to be great. This one is not to be missed in the CGI-filled summer.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

For the music lovers.,"3 1/2 out of 4 stars.John Carney is back with a new musical. His 2006 film ""Once"" is one of my favorite films of all time and I was interested to see where Carney would go next. Watching the trailers for ""Begin Again"" didn't give me much hope for it, but just enough for me to go out and see it. I enjoyed it much more than I expected though.""Begin Again"" is very similar to ""Once,"" except Carney has a bigger budget and famous movie stars. It deals with Dan and Greta (Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, respectively) who after being cheated on by their former boyfriend/girlfriend meet up and record some songs together. Ruffalo is great as the down on his luck, charming, but often drunk, music producer Dan. Knightley also has a solid performance. Adam Levine does a good job of being a jerk and James Corden is hilarious as Greta's busking friend Steve. The films has themes of love, fatherhood, and the way we use music in our lives.""Begin Again"" is for all the music lovers out there who enjoy creating music. The movie is filled with characters whose religion is music. Look at Dan's car and how he has a music cable hung up on the mirror next to a cross. There's a great moment when Dan listens to Greta perform for the first time. What is just a voice and guitar slowly grows into something much bigger and beautiful. The soundtrack is more poppy compared to the folk songs in ""Once,"" but they are nice to listen to.This film is the movie you kind of have to be in the mood for to really enjoy. It can be predictable and sappy at times, but it does it well. If you accept it for what it is, you'll enjoy it. ""Begin Again"" is a musical treat this summer that will leave you wanting to listen to more music and maybe even creating some of your own.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Keira Knightly shines, but otherwise it's a poor imitation of ""Once""","This is a mixed bag - Keira Knightly, as always, brings a charisma and warmth that make almost any movie worth experiencing. Sadly, it is only her warmth and charms that kept this movie afloat through what was a lot of straining and over-efforting with pieces that did not quite succeed. The pieces were poorly done, and did not really fit together into a coherent and fluid narrative. The fails are three-fold:1) The music. This might be just my taste, but I found it lame and flat. And rather than showing a mastery of music that takes us beneath the veneer of ""pop"" and commercial product we are continually sold, the writer displayed a shockingly superficial grasp of the art form. For example, when the Keira Knightly and Mark Ruffalo characters discuss the music that inspired their lives, instead of introducing us to a wonderful and delightful new paradigm of music we may not have been familiar with, all the script did was halfheartedly mention a few stiff and silly clichés.2) Ruffalo's character's behavior was really just a clown show. A fine actor, he was given a series of set pieces as if from a TV movie - and was ACTING bits of the drunken has-been on the verge of rediscovering his family and his integrity and his career, rather than someone actually living that, or doing that. His over-wrought histrionics were, therefore, clownish - unconvincing. One was completely unmoved at those empty displays of ""emote-by-the-numbers.""3) Hailee Steinfeld and Catherine Keener were both rather wasted. Hailee is a very young Oscar nominee with a bright future, but her character's story arc didn't go anywhere. Her character had no spark, nothing that really set her apart as anything specific or meaningful. Similarly the older but equally appealing Catherine Keener also didn't have much to do. Aside from expressing a few standard ex-wife and ""mom"" concerns (she played Hailee's mother), her character didn't do much in the story. Certainly in both cases both of the women were under-used. Both of those otherwise talented and brilliant female actors could just as easily have not been in this movie - and no one would have noticed their absence, their characters had such a teensy impact. And that is the fault of the writer/director, not the actors.As the movie wound down to the final act I had an inkling that this was a limp attempt to rip-off the really great indie movie ""Once."" Except this did not have the spontaneity of ""Once,"" nor the artistic musical sense of that movie. I was shocked to read, later that night, that this movie was written and directed by the same guy who did ""Once."" That is sad - he aimed for a repeat of his earlier success, but completely and utterly failed to capture any but the most superficial resemblance.He would have been better to have steered clear of music and any other similarities to ""Once,"" and made a movie about welding. Or beekeeping. Or something. It could only have been more interesting, more authentic, and more satisfying than this clunker.Overall it was really a ""4,"" but the otherwise talented cast made it a ""5"" (even though they bombed here), and Keira Knightly's good vibes made it a ""6"" (even though her movies are usually 10s).",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Sweet film set in summertime is a Surprise Delight.,"Watching Begin Again reminds us so much of summertime in New York City that you are almost transported, but luckily you get to skip the hot garbage smell.Begin Again is a sweet little film about redemption and staying true to yourself, all set in the vibrant city of New York, where music and location are integral characters in the story.Dan (Mark Ruffalo) used to be a top music executive, but personal problems and a lack of a 'star' has caused him to slip in reputation at his label. Unceremoniously released, he goes on a binge to drown his sorrows, which leads him to a bar in the East Village where Gretta (Keira Knightley) is performing. To him, she sounds like gold. Gretta is very resistant in signing to any major label because she refuses to compromise her art. Also, her long time love and songwriting partner Dave (Adam Levine) recently got a record deal and then everything changed for the worse. From this encounter, Dan and Gretta collaborate to create the music he knows she has deep within her raw talent, and in doing so emerges the powerful transformative ability from music.Begin Again manages to hit all the right notes (Don't hate me, I couldn't help it!) in being a sweet summer film perfect for a light watch on a summer evening. There is something sentimental without being obnoxious and I do believe it comes from the writer/director John Carney's own love and appreciation of music. There is a striking adherence and devotion to music, composition and authenticity that resonates throughout the entire film which can only be possible thanks to the film's creator.As a film about music, songwriters and performing – all the actors involved do a super job, especially Keira Knightley whose singing ability was a virtual unknown prior to this film. Begin Again focuses on the underground alternative/indie scene which is supplementary to her soft and possibly unsure singing style. James Corden who plays Steve, Gretta's old schoolmate and only friend in NYC, is a breath of fresh air in every scene. His energy and innate ability is captivating and his character is a nice antithesis to Adam Levine's contrived douchiness as Dave.So if you find yourself longing for summer on a cold winter night or in need of a delightful film for a casual one-time watch then Begin Again is your girl.Please check out our WEBSITE for all the REVIEWS of recent releases and indie films!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
What did I do to deserve this horrible movie?,"I'm a big fan of the movie ""Once"" but ""Begin Again"" was so bad that I think I have to go back and watch ""Once"" just to make sure it wasn't also a horrible movie. Wow! John Carney really crapped the bed on this one. Mark Ruffalo, who I have always liked in the past, phones in a terrible and clichéd performance. While I can't claim to have been a Keira Knightley fan, I never really hated her but I will probably never sit through another one of her movies after this one. I can't imagine what all of the people who liked this movie saw in it. Really. I can't. It actually makes me wonder if the positive reviews were all written by a paid PR team. This movie was THAT bad. Some highlights: horrible music, clichéd dialogue, repulsive acting, that guy from Maroon 5 sporting a beard, Keira taking a hipster bike ride through NYC, the end of Ruffalo's previously stellar career, directed like an NYU film school project, horrible music, spouting off about ""bad"" and ""commercial"" music but every song in the movie was commercial garbage, the cliché line ""you can learn a lot about someone from their play-list,"" ... I can't keep going ... I just can't. My recommendation, stay far away from this movie. My rating, two thumbs up the writer/director's dark cleft.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Entertaining, creative and good characters","First, I love that you put the song, Thinking About Your Love, by Skipworth and Turner, in this movie! I've always loved their songs, beat and talent. Great choice. The original music was also quite good! Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightly were great, as well as his wife, Catherine Keener, who is always great, and the daughter, Hailee Steinfeld. I love the whole idea of the movie. I could imagine it was fun from the moment John Carney wrote it and set about making it in to a movie. The idea for an album is too clever. Toying with love interests also kept the movie intriguing as did the creative process that was always at work, throughout the movie. My number one judge of a good movie is did it hold my interest and this movie definitely did. I think another way of putting it would be, did the movie seem like it did not seem long, whatever the length of the movie, if it didn't seem long, then it worked, because you lost track of time by being drawn in to the story and characters. Great story and movie! I definitely recommend people go see it and hope it catches fire, because it's much better than most of the movies that are out this summer.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The music in our lives,"I was a big fan of the group the Frames and was very excited when I learned about ""Once"" directed by John Carney and starring Glen Hasard both members of the Frames. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but it had an almost documentary like feel to it. Begin again for me was a statement about how music affects our lives and how different songs can take on different meanings for all of us. For my wife and myself , Ben Folds the Luckiest has a special meaning in our relationship, to most others, it is just another song.I loved how Begin Again opens with a rather banal sounding song being sung by Kiera Knightly in a small nightclub as Ruffalo stands enthralled. Then for the next 15 minutes we discover why.The movie uses music in that way several times and I felt it really worked. Your enjoyment of the film will probably be greatly determined by what you think of the music. I happened to love it. Even that banal song soon takes on all new meaning. The entire cast is great and Ruffalo certainly delivers one of his strongest performances.I have not seen Words and Pictures. My limited knowledge of the film is that it might have a similar theme when it comes to music in our lives. This is a little feel good movie. The kind of film that is a welcome respite in Summer blockbuster season. Last year we had the Way Way back to fill this niche. This year is is Begin Again.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Simply overrated,"Another film about music production, and it's not as good as others of its genre. The song choices and acting are merely OK, but the notion of the love of music is just romanticized.Do Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo even love music? Because I just can't feel their passions in their acting. In the plot, music seemed to be the emotional outlet for the character (Gretta). But when this is portrayed in Knightley's hollow acting, her usual pretentious smirk, make me feel that she loves music just because it's cool. In short I think she faked her love of music.And practically, Knightley can't sing. She fakes it but she just can't. Her voice is so flat and her acting is disappointingly pretentious. Ruffalo is doing a better job but his decadent face always reminds me of Hulk.I love Adam Levine though, but I really think that the songs in this movie are B-graded. The original soundtrack of this movie would not be worth-buying.",,Anonymous,Music
good but not as great as Once,"Dan Mulligan (Mark Ruffalo) is a drunken executive of an indie record label. He headed A&R at Island Records for 2 years before starting his own label Distressed Records with Saul Byron (Yasiin Bey). However he has been down and out for years. He's separated from his wife Miriam (Catherine Keener) and estranged from his daughter Violet (Hailee Steinfeld). He gets fired from his own label and then he sees Gretta James (Keira Knightley) performing at a bar after she's pushed onto the stage by her friend Steve (James Corden). She had come to NYC with boyfriend Dave Kohl (Adam Levine). Dave became an overnight success after his music got onto a movie. He cheated on her and they broke up right before that night at the bar.Writer/director John Carney fails to relive the same magic as his big breakout 'Once'. It would be a disservice to dismiss this movie for failing to jump that high bar. It's hard to capture magic twice especially in a similar fashion. My first opinion as I watched the movie is that Dan is from another era and Carney is past his due date. Then it turns out that Dan is actually coming from another era. His character quickly grows on me. Keira Knightley is a great actress but only an adequate singer. On the other hand, Adam Levine is the exact opposite. They're both good enough at their weaker sides to make this movie work. Their scenes together are good with Keira doing most of the heavy lifting. Keira's singing is weak but the group production is able to pump her up. James Corden adds a little fun.

"Lovable , amazing soundtracks , the casting is proper.","lovable movie ,, amazing Casting ,, the songs, the directing , i already started downloading the soundtracks . so the movie started in two separated paths ,one for the singer (Gretta) and one for the producer (Dan) two different perspectives that led to the moment they met... so that was a nice touch. the plot was so real,it seemed like it really represented the music industry.-. honestly tho, Keira Knightley's laugh is mad ,, it's magical with her little tilted tooth,, gosh she's gorgeous ;) the ending was also unpredictable ,, loved the way it was wrapped up. overall, it was a really good movie. and being nominated for the music at least was justifiable.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Bottom then up,"What does one need when hitting rock bottom? Someone else who touched bottom too.A disgruntled music producer is going through the worst day of his life, having been fired from the company he founded as well as realising he is not doing a great job as a father also. In an already half intoxicated state he walk into a bar and he hears an unknown singer; suddenly he has hope for the future.It turns out that the singer that impressed him was in the doldrums as well, having just split up from a long term boyfriend.This chance encounter leads to a collaboration, thus filling them with a renewed sense of hope for the future. The obstacles are many, the means pretty much non-existent. Still, two people with nothing to lose will find a way and pull few strings to make it happen.Whilst I can see why it has delighted critics and audiences alike, I do not quite share the prevailing enthusiasm. Don't get me wrong, the main thrust of this (two people who hit bottom trying to pick themselves up) was relatively effective, it is just that a lot of time was devoted to the main characters internal conflicts as opposed to getting a stronger sense of beginning again.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I'm full of light!,"I can't believe two things about this movie.First, I can't believe such stories are still possible nowadays and there are people, who want to tell them and do that great. Light, sunny, heartwarming--you just live along with the characters, while watching it. You smile, when they smile, you feel sad, when they have a tough time, and you enjoy the energy and passion they put in making the album wondering around New York. I'm simply disconnected from the outer world until the very credits. :)And the second thing I can't believe about this movie is how I could not run into it earlier. Eight years had to pass before I held upon some unfamiliar modern musical story. And in a few moments I already knew, that I got another one for my personal Rewatch List.The lovely Keira Knightley, the wonderful Mark Ruffalo, the amazing James Corden, the magical Cee Lo Green and, of course, Adam Levine, who played his role pretty convincingly. :)))In short, I'm amazed with this story, actors, music, and the New York City itself. It's not a blockbuster, but it's much better, because this is a story about oursevles and our efforts simply to be happy in our lives, with our families and friends.My love to each and every one who made this movie possible. Thank you, guys.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Begin Again is a modern day, soul-arousing comedy that tells a tale of two lost souls, who stumble across each other and create music together.","'m a big fan of Keira Knightley. I love her in period drama's such as Pride and Prejudice and The Duchess.I think the essence of the film was delivered well by the cast. Mark Ruffalo, who plays an eccentric ex-record executive added fun to the film. I wouldn't say this film gave Keira's best performance but she was still enjoyable to watch. I thought that the music was lovely and Adam Levine's voice was as always, astoundingly beautiful. As a singer/songwriter, it definitely reminded me how much music feeds souls like mine and it made me feel like I wanted to randomly busk in the middle of the cinema just for the love of it! An enjoyable feel-good and inspiring film to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Beyond dire,I came to this film on the back of the reviews which in retrospect must surely have been written by people associated with it. It is that bad. The basic premise is okay; hardly original and inspired but with the right screen writer and an alternate leading lady (one with some credibility and appeal) it might have been moderately entertaining. But sadly it has neither. The storyline is way beyond predictable - I defy anyone not to work out the ending by half way through. Keira Knightley is hideously miscast and the others just limp along with a limp script. The music is also incredibly lame. If you are looking for a film with music as its backbone head for the wonderful Rudderless and give this sorry mess a wide berth. One star is generous.,1.0,Anonymous,Music

Effortlessly charming and delighting.,"Never thought I would love this so much, but when I found out the director also did Sing Street, I mean c'mon now it makes sense. Once is on my wishlist as well now and I'm gonna need to see that movie sometime soon. This film worked for me all the way through because I was delighted by, mostly, the performances of Keira Knightley, Hailee Steinfeld and Mark Ruffalo. They all brought so much soul to their characters and I was always interested in the story due to that. The story itself is great too. It is simple but it totally works and feels completely natural and honest. Begin Again is just lovely and I think I might even watch it a few more times over the years.",,Anonymous,Music
"Movie is OK, soundtrack is GREAT!!","I love good musical movies, and like the idea of a star being given the chance to be a star storyline. This type of movie has been done countless times, most often they seem to fail and fail miserably. This one has a lot of redeeming features, namely the soundtrack. To say the music is good is an understatement, and if you are trying to decide if this movie deserves your time or money, it does but mostly for the music.It's really obvious that Keira Knightly can't play the guitar, she can carry a tune through, as her singing is decent. In fact all the actors hired to pretend to be musician are just that, actors, not musicians. Mark Ruffalo's daughter in the movie can't even hold a guitar pic right, all of which makes this disturbing, why couldn't the producers/directors at least hire musicians to play musicians? Wouldn't that add some authenticity to their movie? With all that said, if you can look beyond what I previously said, this is an enjoyable movie. It's very predictable, the acting is very weak, the storyline is equally weak, but it is a feel good enjoyable, life is good type light-weight movie that I recommend, mostly because of the exceptional supporting soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Awfully fake for a movie about authenticity,"FINALLY gave in and watched the movie Begin Again. The soundtrack promised that it would be disappointing, but still I hoped for something that vaguely resembled Once... Alas, Begin Again is a movie that makes big claims about ""real art"" but understands ""art"" about as much as a shoe. The one thing it does have in common with Once is that Carney ripped the beginning line/melody of Hansard's ""All the Way Down"" (""you have broken..."") in the song ""Like a Fool."" When I saw that they gave Glen Hansard some ""writing credits,"" the only thing I could imagine is that they were forced to pay him retroactively for this line that they stole because Hansard's music has nothing in common with the music in this emotionless movie. Why is Knightley singing like a cute little bird even when she is supposed to be singing an ""F- U"" song to her ex? The whole movie made me extremely annoyed, though I wanted to like it - the beginning scene that felt forced (look a girl can play a guitar - isn't that super original?), the 0 chemistry between Ruffalo (a usually fantastic actor) and Knightley, the scattered plot with weirdly timed flashbacks, and the constant message that this movie was supposed to be about authenticity when it was decidedly fake!!! Don't bring in a Maroon 5 singer if you want real music. It boggles my mind that John Carney wrote this script after writing Once. The only explanation I have is that Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova provided the heart to Once whereas neither Ruffalo nor Knightley had the knack for music to do so for Begin Again.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

"Good story about musicians and a producer, but will probably appeal only to music lovers","Begin Again was fairly enjoyable but I think only musicians and music fans will be able to identify with it. Greta, a budding songwriter, moves to New York City with her boyfriend and songwriting partner Dave, who has just made it as a musician. His affair with a producer leaves her reeling and she contemplates leaving the city. One night at a bar, she is spotted by Dan, a struggling record label executive who offers to sign her on. She refuses at first, not wanting to compromise her musical independence, but changes her mind the next day. They meet Dan's partner, who is unimpressed but agrees to reconsider if they can provide a demo tape. Dan pulls together a team of musicians, and they record an album at various locations around the city. Dan and Greta help each other face their respective personal problems and the film ends with them both making a fresh start.Songs and various ideals in music (e.g. staying true to the original emotion/intention of a piece) play a large part in driving the plot forward and shaping the characters' actions. Not being deeply into music myself, this was something I couldn't really appreciate, but I can imagine that those who are will find the film appealing. None of the songs left a deep impression either. Nevertheless, I think the story has a ring of truth to it. We see three different music industry types: fiercely independent musician who hates commercialisation (Greta), artist willing to compromise his music for popularity (Dave), plus visionary and resourceful label executive (Dan). The acting was pretty good all round and I was pleasantly surprised to find that Keira Knightley can sing. So while the movie probably is good, I think it only appeals to people who are really into music.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

How is this movie getting decent reviews?,"Everyone who scored this over a 6 should send ME $1 (inside movie factoid) for tricking me to sit through this contrived snore fest.

If Keira flashed one more knowing ""this is my sexy money shot"" smirk, I was going to lose it. My wife thought the movie was decent and she walks out (seriously....10 minutes in to award winning movies she gets up and walks) on 9/10 good movies we attend. She's the barometer of reverse taste.

Whole more than the sum of the parts ... it works,"In spite of a number of structural and script flaws, this tasty little gem works as well or better than any half-dozen ""feel good"" films that wandered out of Hollywood in the last few years. Recommended.(One example: a key script point is when one of the characters leaves a ""voice message"" for another which is actually an entire song. There isn't a voice mail system on the planet which would accept that length of message. Another oddity is the casting of Hailee Steinfeld as a statuesque 14 year old teenager, a casting choice made all the stranger by the fact that she was 17 at the time of filming and looked like she was in her late 20s. In fact this actress, who played the lead in TRUE GRIT at age 13, should have a patent on looking older than she is.)The good news? Much the same way that John Carney's script emphasizes vision as the key ingredient for a successful song, his own vision is more than enough to compensate for some of the strangeness here, and the film works very much in the style of those classic British comedies of manners we don't see much of anymore (a la 3 Weddings...) Other notes for the die-hard fans:* Knightly and Ruffalo spent much of their careers making other actors look good. Nice to see them get a chance to make themselves look good* Wow. Who knew Adam Levine could act? Fact is, he is a natural and comes across better here than as a judge in that infamous show. Can't say the same for Ceelo who is just as uncomfortable as an actor as he is in reality TV* is there an award for best integrated closing credits? Not talking bloopers here, but scenes that run in the credits which actually complement the film ... best I have ever seen ... if all closing credits were this good, viewers would stay to the very end",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Beautiful music, lovely story, shallow characters","I enjoyed the movie, mainly because of the music, the soundtrack is awesome. The story is there for the music. The story is the background for the music, the reason for the music, since this movie is about song writers and producing music. It is a fun story, engaging, but not real. Either things go real downwards or so they say, or upwards. When upwards, everything goes so smooth. The characters are so one dimensional, no real human interaction, no emotions, even though they mention real heavy staff, but none of it really gets into the movie.

Uplifting!,"Begin Again (2013)
I saw this hidden gem recently. Very occasionally a movie comes along which uplifts our spirits while being practical and not preachy. This is not a love story but a movie about love and music. There is so much music in the movie yet not a movie about music - it's about people who appreciate good music.I loved the original songs, it was so relatable and comes scattered across the movies length. Both Mark Ruffalo as an alcoholic down-and-out music producer and Keira Knightly as musician songwriter who hasn't realized her full potential did an amazing job - and she sings!!!Lovely cameos from Adam Levine as a popular singer. CeeLo Green as himself and James Gorden as a struggling musician - what a wonderful surprise. The ever wonderful Catherine Keener as Ruffalo's divorced wife was just apt and very true to role. Hailey Steinfeld Violet (who I am beginning to be a serious fan of) - Such heavy talent at such an young age. She did a brilliant job in True Grit when she was even younger (acted with stalwarts 3-4 times her age) and still made a mark.There is a scene in the movie where everyone comes together and while weighing options just all of a sudden decide to shoot songs in iconic New York places - It was so extempore and so real. There is another scene where you relive the same moment from 2 different perspectives and one from Mark Ruffalos view was - in many ways the ""woah"" moment for me which makes believe there is still magic left in movies..The song ""Lost Stars"" was a nominee for best original song in Oscars that year and Keira can sing - quite impressive!At the end I was amazed on how my mood changed for good. It wasn't the laughs, wasn't the music or the complications of the protagonist's love life; it was a gentle reminder that there is no perfection in life - if we don't give up on love and ourselves - there is a rainbow waiting. And that my friends is what I love in a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Serviceable story, technically decent, but falls short","I really tried to like this movie. It had all of the elements of success: a great cast, excellent production, and a solid premise.However, it just couldn't win me over and ultimately fell flat.The biggest beef I had with the movie, and admittedly this is a very subjective matter, is that if you're going to make a movie like this, the music must at least be good. I don't consider myself to be a music elitist; I can appreciate most forms of music. However, the music (presumably) written for the movie is bland and quickly forgettable. I'm not sure what scene the music is trying to appeal to, but it seems to me like all of it was written by committee, being as generic and inoffensive as possible, all the while having no real melody.The story also suffered from poor writing in several spots. Plot contrivances abound, and the end of the movie is equally puzzling and underwhelming.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

"""This is not Gerry Maguire"" but is a nice film about music and relationships.","Film opens in a bar. A shy girl, played by Keira Knightley, sings a song. In the audience is a strange looking man played by Mark Ruffalo. The film goes back in time to see how they got there. However, this is not one of those films that starts with the end scene, thus spoiling all the suspense. Here the flashbacks are done well, and cleverly, to quickly bring the viewer back to the bar, and the start of the film. Now we learn why Mr Ruffalo's character looks strange, and why Miss Knightley's character is shy.Mark Ruffalo looks very grizzled and he seems to have got his brash New York character down to a tee, despite not being a native New Yorker himself. Miss Knightley plays well the idealistic song-writer from out-of-town.The plot revolves around them getting together to produce some music. This reviewer was a little concerned that there may be too much music in this film, however this turned out to not be a problem. There are perhaps four major music scenes, one or two of which felt, to me, ever so slightly, too long. However, knowing that the film was about music, I merely gritted my teeth, very gently.Earlier this year, this reviewer saw Miss Knightley in 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit' and although playing against Kenneth Branagh, Kevin Costner and Chris Pine, she more than held her own in scenes, some of which were exciting, and some sweet.Miss Knightley prepared thoroughly for her role in 'Begin Again'. IMDb quotes her as saying she was taught guitar by her husband but that it led to disharmony in the relationship. In an interview, Miss Knightley says that she learnt all her lines prior to shooting, but when filming started, Writer/Director John Carney decided to do a lot of improvisation. What were lines, and what was improvisation, is unclear. Certainly the early singing scenes seem authentic and it must be hoped that the sweet-voiced Miss Knightley does have her songs released, in reality, outside of this film.John Carney directs well. The film is meant to be low-budget, but it looks good. It has an almost documentary feel, especially in some of the music scenes. This is conveyed by the camera-work. Small hand-held cameras seem to have been well utilized to give an authentic look. There are none of the dreadful dizzying spinning shots that some directors think are needed to give an authentic documentary look. This is all achieved by the way the cameras are used. There is a street-guerrilla-look to the filming that fits in perfectly with the theme of street-guerrilla music-making and thus gives it authenticity.The main stars are also supplemented by a good supporting cast. James Corden convinces in his role as another musician and the scenes between him and fellow Brit Miss Knightley seem very natural. Mr Ruffalo too has some great scenes with Hailee Steinfeld and Catherine Keener. Again they seem authentic and believable. An early scene with Mr Ruffalo and Miss Steinfeld is one of the funniest in the film. So there is some comedy too, in this film about music. There is also nice interaction between Miss Knightley and Miss Steinfeld.One of the main themes of the film is relationships. Miss Knightley plays a character who seems very sensitive, perceptive and empathetic. Thus through her, we the audience can quickly pick up the vibes and follow the plot. Mr Ruffalo, last year also made 'Now You See Me', in which he played a hard-boiled detective hunting down some bank-robbing magicians, however his character did have some charm. Here too, in this film, Mr Ruffalo gives us charm with his native New Yorker character, who also has a more realistic gritty bad-boy side to him as well.This film about artists at work, and their lives and loves, is one that surpassed my expectations. The relationships were dealt with in a realistic way and the comedy and the music were both pleasant. Perhaps not a rom-com, this is though a nice film, that is both emotional and entertaining, as well as making some comment on current music trends.A good film which surpassed my expectations. 10/10.Warning: Film contains beards. Advice: Stay to see the end-credits.",,Anonymous,Music
Pleasant Film,"John Carney's Begin Again is a nice little somewhat ""feel good"" musical set in New York. The film features some very good performances and the songs are also memorable and well written.Begin Again tells the story of Greta (played by Keira Knightley) and her boyfriend/college sweetheart, named Dave (played by Adam Levine of Maroon 5 and The Voice making his feature film debut), who are songwriter partners. Their relationship hits a rocky road when Dave lands a major deal in Los Angeles and strays away from Greta, leaving her on her own. She is discovered on an east village stage by a washed up divorced record label executive named Dan (played by Mark Ruffalo), who takes to her talent and tries to make her a name. As the two begin their collaboration, they run into some problems along the way.There are some clear character arcs in the story as well. Dan, for example, goes from being an unlikeable drunk who is a disgraced and fired record producer, to having his job back, as well as improving his relationship with his daughter. Similarly, Greta goes from being a love-struck songwriter with no real ambitions to being an ambitious songwriter/singer who can clearly think on her own. The stories of these two characters parallel each other well. Other character arcs include Dan's daughter, Violet (played by Hailee Steinfeld), who seems to have limited screen time (disappearing after the first ten minutes and not reappearing until an hour in), going from an angst-ridden daughter to discovering her talents for playing guitar. While Dave, Greta's lover, goes from being an ambitious songwriter/singer to understanding just what fame is doing to him, in a story-arc that is almost like the opposite of Greta's.The acting in the film is very good. Mark Ruffalo has gained some weight, and is showing his age. When he talks to Knightley near the end of the film and says ""you know nothing"", he delivers that line with such energy and force, it is terrific. Keira Knightly herself comes off as rather bitchy at the beginning of the film, but by the end, she develops into a finer character, even if her performance at times can feel emotionless. Hailee Steinfeld, as Ruffalo's daughter, is wasted and brings nothing to the table. Similarly, Catherine Keener is wasted as Ruffalo's ex, and her character is treated like your typical divorced nagging ex-wife. In his major film debut, singer Adam Levine has a nice voice, but his performances are, at times, bland, though his scenes with Knightley do show good moments of acting. Additionally, of note in the cast are Mos Def (under the alias Yasiin Bey!!!) as the owner of the record studio and Ceelo Green as a character named Troublegum, as a performer (basically playing himself).The songs are really nicely done. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when Knightley and Ruffalo are walking down the streets of New York and they manage to incorporate ""Luck Be a Lady"" by Frank Sinatra in a way that gave me a feeling of happiness and excitement. The majority of the original songs are written by Gregg Alexander and Nick Lashley (director John Carney himself contributed to two songs, including ""Like a Fool"" which has to do with trusting people. Knightley herself has a nice singing voice (having been trained by a voice specialist), and songs like ""Lost Stars"" and ""A Higher Place"" are good and having meaning. There are many good performances, even if some of the characters exist solely for the purpose of having real nice songs played. Given Carney's previous film, Once, one should probably not be surprised, as that film also dealt with music.Begin Again has a very pleasing tone to it. The songs, along with the character arcs, contribute to the films overall style. Definitely worth checking out.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Begin Again,"Never before in the entirety of my life have I ever advocated for a romantic drama movie let alone a musical drama. But I guess an exception had to be made when I came across Begin Again.The film begins with a shot in the bar of Gretta (Keira Knightely) reluctantly performing at an open-mic night. Gretta an independent and tough singer-songwriter who's coping from a recent heart break catches the eye of Dan (Mark Ruffalo) an out of work record label executive.A chance occurrence brings together these two lost souls for a musical journey that takes them through every street and corner of the beautiful New York City. Director Carney does an exceptional job in creating a wonderful medley that lasts throughout the film.In one the scenes Dan says, ""One of the most banal scenes is suddenly invested with so much meaning! All these banalities - They're suddenly turned into these... these beautiful, effervescent pearls. From Music."".Well that's exactly what happens. Carney takes a simple scene and brilliantly transforms it into a melodious performance.From the very beginning of the movie you'll find yourself tapping to every tune and singing to every lyrical poetry. As you take this wonderful joy ride you'll find yourself completely immersed in the lives of these two damaged characters and their journey to help each other out of their despair. Carney takes you on an emotional ride which is surprisingly uncliched.Ruffalo plays the character of a middle aged train wreck in the most subtle way possible. Knightley's stunningly soulful voice will bring a definite smile on your face. There is an unusually surprising chemistry between the two which makes this journey even more creative.To be very honest I didn't have any expectation and unsurprisingly thought it would be your next door clichéd drama. But obviously I was proved wrong. Carny uses your basic girl meets boy formula but then intelligently deviates away from it to give you a creative musical drama. I realise I may sound like a broken record, but it's simply to emphasize the impact this had on me. So whoever made it to the end this review do check out the movie and let me know what you think. Until next time.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Slightly Interesting,"This is the story of two aspiring musicians in New York City. Unfortunately, is isn't very well-written. Writer/director Andrew Carney, who also created Once, just isn't a good writer. The on screen talent is there; Mark Ruffalo, Kiera Knightly, Adam Levine, but film is a collaborative medium. The footage of the lower East Side of New York City is probably this movie's best feature. It recalls Manhattan. What can you say about a movie that makes these three actors look their worst and puts them in a series of not very believable situations? We are supposed to believe that you can put Kiera Knightly in a small club and have her perform a song but people will not look at her because she isn't wearing makeup. You'd have to get someone with much worse bone structure to make that even believable. We are supposed to believe that Mark Ruffalo is a successful music industry figure who wants music to be free. That's not what they were known for. Supposedly Kiera Knightly objects to wearing makeup to the point that she'd rather fail in her profession. It's not like someone asked her to dress up like Rihanna. The things the characters are supposedly fighting for seem less than believable, or even necessary.You hear a lot of music. Unfortunately, it is vapid and forgettable. This makes the plot even more unlikely. Supposedly there are issues about musical integrity. That plot line just doesn't work because the actual music is vapid.I saw this movie because it was the only thing in the theaters that would appeal to a grown up woman in months. I guess is was better than not seeing a movie, but not as good as a good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"A very good film, IF you don't mind continual cursing.","I'm not quite sure how to write 10 lines about a film without containing any (spoiler) information about it. I thought this was a very good film. But there is a good reason for giving it an 'R' rating. I find it really hard to believe that relatively normal people, such as depicted in the film, would speak with continual cursing using the worst of words, as though it was the way they always speak in normal conversation. I definitely would not want to be around anyone who talked like the characters in this film do, just so much fun and games with every other words the dirtiest curse words possible. Other than that, I thought it was a very good story which kept me totally engrossed. I liked all the actors and characters and the music, and would definitely 'like' to recommend it, but would never in a million years recommend it to anyone at my church, or anyone with what I consider to be normal morals.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Very enjoyable film!,"As I am writing this Lenoard Nemoy died. Just as Star Trek took us to imaginary space continuum, this film takes us to space continuum of New York music scene. I would say non existent scene, because I never cool people like that when I lived in NYC. Although, I did live there for a short period of time, may be times have changed.I truly enjoyed this film. I enjoyed cool, casual plot. I enjoyed the music. I enjoyed cool, casual acting. I really succeeded in relaxing while watching this film. That is a rare occurrence for me, since they make tense and visual effects filled films these days. These relaxing, art oriented film are more rare these days. Too bad!

A fresh and heartwarming New York summer ballad,"If you are looking for a feel-good movie, you have found one to see. It's a movie about friendship, about failures and new beginnings, about solidarity, about second chances, about life. It's also about love, and what I liked most was the total absence of trite sentimentalism, which would have ruined the meaning and sense of the story, where feelings are never made explicit, but simply flow along with the music played and sung in the corners of New York. And what new, what else can be said about this unique city?: still full of hope, full of life, still the place nurturing the dreams of men and women, and even where an album can be recorded en plein air. I liked the warm and heartwarming atmosphere and the settings, I also liked the songs, which are never obtrusive and manage to communicate how music can shape and even change people and things. As far as acting, Mark Ruffalo really steals the show, thanks to a strong and biting performance, Keira Knightley does her good job as an actress and as a singer, as well. On the whole, a truly enjoyable, fresh picture, making one feel like being there",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Tale of Music & Redemption...,"John Carney's 'Begin Again' is a wonderful, heartwarming Tale of Music & Redemption. The film balances between music, love & also humor, admirably, while the performances, are fabulous.'Begin Again' Synopsis: A chance encounter between a disgraced music-business executive and a young singer-songwriter new to Manhattan turns into a promising collaboration between the two talents.The characters in 'Begin Again' are in search for redemption & they all the achieve that, through music & the rhythm of life. Their journey, as people or as characters, is at times saddening, but extremely heartwarming, as well.Carney's Screenplay blends human-emotions with music, ingeniously. Carney's Direction, on the other-hand, is simplistic. Cinematography & Editing are flawlessly done. A Special Mention for the melodious music throughout.Performance-Wise: Mark Ruffalo & Keira Knightley, both of whom are yet awaiting a much deserved Oscar in their shelves, deliver sparkling performances. Ruffalo is natural to the core, displaying love, frustration & ambition with effortless ease, while Knightley is a delight. She expresses each & every emotion, so beautifully. Also, the on-screen chemistry between the two, is exciting. Catherine Keener is fantastic. Has Keener ever delivered a bad performance? Hailee Steinfeld is nicely restrained. James Corden is first-rate. Adam Levine is alright.On the whole, 'Begin Again' is a GEM. Two Thumbs Up!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Cliché with Good Acting but Mediocre Music,"Mark Ruffalo really shines in this one, which is why I gave it a six. While the rest of the cast is competent, it's really his movie. The plot is utterly predictable, but the chemistry between the protagonists restrained but smoldering (the result of which is the only intriguing guesswork in the film).But this is a film about MUSIC. Almost all of which is terribly lackluster but for one scene. None of it would I put on and give my full attention to. None of it grabbed me -- it played like pablum, seemingly crafted not to offend anyone. I found it really quite dull.Come on! A film about music should have great songs. Sadly, in this effort, there are none of those, IMHO. Where was its ""Falling Slowly?""Watchable, sweet, and forgettable. Too bad. with the right music, I could have forgiven its flaws and really enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Farewell to Music: 'Begin Again' a Heartbreaking Masterpiece,"""Begin Again"" is a story of music, love, and loss, told with an understated yet masterful direction by Carney. The film captures the gritty beauty of New York City, and the performances by Knightley and Ruffalo are both delicate and devastating. The film's use of music is achingly beautiful and adds depth and emotion to the story. The film tells a story of a struggling musician and a record executive who discover each other and fall in love amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. The performances by the actors are raw and powerful, capturing the complexity of the characters' emotions. The story is a reminder of how fragile and fleeting love and music can be, but also how it can be used as a source of hope and healing. It is a film that stays with you long after the credits have rolled. A farewell to music and love, ""Begin Again"" is a true work of art.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not another Manhattan movie?,"No, the danger is not over. There are more films from that area coming up, which for some reason often inspires comedy. Here we meet the producer who has drunk his business away and is fired from it. We also meet the English girl, who is not impressed by anything and certainly not her own song- writing.Much of the rest is foreseeable, the contrasts of those two have been seen many times before, the conflicts too and the good humor. But Cinderella stories never seem to get out of fashion.But we are waiting for a warm Detroit comedy. We'll have to wait, I guess.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Aren't we all Lost Stars?,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. The music, the acting, the story, it's all great. Like listening to music, this film is something a person needs to experience for themselves to fully appreciate it
The film follows two characters, Gretta and Dan, who are both down on their luck. Dan is a music producer who has lost everything. Gretta is a singer/songwriter who was dumped by her now-famous boyfriend. However, everything changes when Dan hears Gretta, and he convinces her to make an album with him. I won't spoil anything but the themes of love and human connection being represented in music is so powerful. However, the film really makes you think about what really matters in life. And the way the music complements the plot and the writing is simply amazing.
In addition to this, the casting is perfect. Keira Knightley blew me away the first time I saw it. Not only is she an amazing actor, but her singing voice is simply stunning. Adam Levine is also a great singer and adds a lot to the film. To top it all off, Mark Ruffalo gives a performance worthy of an Oscar. He might not sing, but he really establish the emotion of the film, and his relationship with Kerria is so sweet. Hailee Steinfeld, who was rather young when this was made, also gives the film an extra element as she illustrates what it is like to be a kid in a broken home situation. And even though I'm not his biggest fan James Corden played his part perfectly.
In the end, this movie not only has a great soundtrack but also a compelling story about human perseverance. And if you ever feel like giving up or just need a good pick-me-up, watch this movie.
""Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies

"Begin Again isn't just your typical romantic comedy, it's rather mature.","One of those rare films where the two lead characters actually don't hook up and live happily ever after. The Hollywood glitz and generic script have been brushed aside to create a refreshing romance full of musicality. A songwriter and music producer have the worst day ever, and by chance meet at a bar to which they set out to create an album. Pointing swords towards the bland pop music of today, the film's theme of authenticity and originality is prominent in every scene. Not just in the music, but also in love. Greta discovers her rock star boyfriend is cheating on her and rejects her for fame and fortune. Dan struggles adjusting to modern music (which he pretty much detests...I can see why!) and is fired from his job. So yes, a bad day indeed. Then comes the third act which overcomes the boring romantic comedy formula by not falling in love! No long kiss in the rain, just one genuine heartwarming stare of kindness and admiration. An absolutely charming film, I must say. What does help is the music. It's pleasant to listen to and will probably be downloading the soundtrack. Boasted by vocals from Adam Levine, James Corden and Keira Knightley. Emotionally charged and full of reflection. A very unusual cast though. Knightley and Ruffalo are electric, charismatic and pretty much perfect. Then we have Adam ""Your Sugarrrr...Yes Pleaseeee"" Levine who can actually act, but most importantly can sing. Followed by Cee Lo ""Forget Youuuuu"" Green who should've had way more screen time. James Corden, Hailee Steinfeld and Catherine Keener are just underused which is a shame because they all felt so natural. The script on the whole was decent, a good combination of wit and humour to keep the atmosphere light hearted. The more emotionally involved scenes may not be executed brilliantly, but I'm sure if you have some emotion you will feel connected to the moment (not me...I'm heartless). Also admired the non-linear narrative structure in the first act. An infectiously feel good flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Once Was Enough,"You can get so far ahead of this picture, you may have to go to the corner for snacks and back to let it catch up. If you don't see a plot development coming, they will sing a song about it. Don't worry. I have a soft spot for movies about music and musicians who triumph although the music is undeniably terrible. And it is. Keira Knightley, I assume, does her own whispery, little girl singing and the acting is in the mumble, behavioral style which is sure-fire to glaze your interest in most any of the characters. We are told much was improvised. Much like the music that was not written because no one here reads music or can compose. Songs are ""written"" in diaries or on crumpled pieces of paper lending them ""authenticity"" in this type of sing spiel. Mark Ruffalo gives the film some weight and humor, as he always does, but he's wasted in this less than middle-brow pawn to the pop music industry. Knightley looks anorexic and actually seems to lose weight during the film and developed a prominent under bite by the end. James Corden has enough to do to show he could be a major film actor with the right script. Cinematography shows New York's lower east side at its seediest. Catherine Keener, as fine an actress in films as there is, gets the thankless ex role.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazed.,"This is the first time that I've seen this movie. I just finished watching it and I've been sitting here mesmerized ever since. See, I was all mopey and upset over life drama and I went to amazon to find something generic to help me fall asleep.Well, I'm still awake. And I'm still pondering the entirety of this film. I absolutely do not want to give away any spoilers, but I absolutely want to share this beauty with the world. It just got everything RIGHT. The daughter. The execs. The bonds. The lack of depression and drama in the middle. I kept hoping that everything wouldn't fail and be destroyed and that things would actually go okay for people. And I was not only impressed, but I was not let down. Everything went how it should. Yes, there were tears and resentment and anger. But there was this coming-of-age thing and an enlightenment thing and an aha! thing and an I get it thing. I'm blown away. The sweetness and tenderness of this movie stole my heart. I believed every single actor every single time. The little moments were so right.That look between Mark and Keira. That single second in time is my favorite I've seen. Because they chose correctly. And it was brilliant and beautiful and real and honest. Ahhh.I indeed loved this film, but I have to give it 9/10 stars because I'm nitpicking on two things that shouldn't even be looked at as negatives. Kind of like a, ""if I MUST find SOMETHING wrong..."" scenario. One is that I thought the kids being involved in the one scene (I'm trying to leave out spoilers) seemed a tiny bit forced to me. Like an episode of Glee where everyone comes together to spontaneously sing a bit too well. It should have warmed my heart but I just felt awkward for them. Sorry. Hate me. The second was that I didn't think Dan's daughter should have been a child prodigy so fast. I wanted more of a back story and for her to be shy and nervous and screw up a few times and then she could learn her ultimate passion for it. I loved her relationship with Greta. I just wish we saw a few more minutes of her evolving before she was evolved.All in all, I am keeping this special film in my pocket for the future. It was truly a feel-good movie, but it was so much more than that. It made me cry at the sheer goodness of it. The music, the relationships, the little things. I loved it all. I wasn't sure why Keira had to dress like she was a middle aged woman in the 90's at times, but she made it work so well.Basically what I am saying is that I adored every second of this. I'm going to go to sleep now.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Wonderful! Nearly as good as Once!,"John Carney's follow-up to the enormously popular Once is really pretty similar to Once. This might have annoyed me if it hadn't been a few years since Once, but I didn't mind that much at all. The music isn't quite as good, and he's mostly working with Hollywood stars this time instead of musicians, but I ended up thoroughly charmed by it. Keira Knightley, playing the up-and-coming singer/songwriter trying to get over her recent heartbreak, is just luminous. She is just so damed lovable and sweet. She has a pretty good singing voice, too. Not something you haven't heard before, but it's nice. Mark Ruffalo plays the down-and-out record producer who discovers her. As cliché as the two parts may be, the actors add a lot of personality to them and they come off as real. The film also co-stars Hailee Steinfeld and Catherine Keener as Ruffalo's daughter and ex-wife. Musicians Mos Def, Adam Levine and CeeLo Green also co-star (Levine is the only one who is a decent actor; he plays Knightley's ex-boyfriend, who's becoming a mega-rock star). As I said, the songs aren't quite as good as the ones in Once. They are a lot poppier. But I wouldn't say they're any less heartfelt. The film may not have a ""Falling Slowly"" level song, but the one Knightley sings as a voice message to Levine is almost as good.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Record Company, Schmecord Company","6.5. A quaint film for the music lover, thought not as quaint as the title, which is about as evocative as a tumbleweed. Still, the film celebrates the joy of music and a certain indie spirit as likeable characters converge to record an album using only their wits and personal resources.Highlights are the songs, which may not be everyone's style, but are sweet and melodic and sung by Knightly. Mark Ruffalo stands out as the has-been producer desperate to resurrect his career. James Corden and others seemed under-utilized in terms of comedic potential of an ensemble (think Hugh Grant's friends in Notting Hill).It would have been nice to see more cameos from the industry, especially in documenting its manufactured nature, as well as Knightly being challenged with stardom. Will she go down the same path as Adam Levine, etc.? Of course, her final decision regarding the album is intended to answer that question, but seeing it in action would have been much more entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Great Surprise,"I really didn't expect much from this film. I figured it might be a bit of a side project for Ruffalo and Knightley while they were both more concentrated on Foxcatcher and The Imitation Game. The inclusion of Adam Levine in an acting role also rang alarm bells.However, I could not have been more wrong. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this film. The relationship between the two main characters is brilliant but the real star relationship that I enjoyed was the re-connection of Ruffalo's character to his estranged daughter (played brilliantly by Hailee Steinfeld). The two of them capture a very accurate attritional relationship between an angsty teen and a failing father.This is a lovely, feel-good, indie film that gives us an insight into a cross section of the music industry. The film is so well cast that these characters really gel and you can feel the differing relationships between them. The film does all this without falling into classic rom-com stereotypes and disengaging the audience.It is so refreshing to see a film genuinely explore character relationships without feeling the need to force any romance story lines.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Rough around the edges but thoroughly charming.,"It's been a while since Irish filmmaker and bassist John Carney has graced the spotlight. 2007's low-budget Once was a real treat and earned itself a thoroughly deserved Oscar for its memorable song ""Falling Slowly."" It feels like Carney's trying to repeat the magic here with an Americanized but not-much-bigger-budget version with Begin Again with A-list stars Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo. They're a welcome here as their screen presence overcomes clunkiness in the production. Too often does the photography feel sloppy and unplanned with illogical blocking and no texture. But Begin Again isn't a film concerned with looks, it's all about the music and the artists.After struggling with an inexplicable nonlinear structure, feeling obligated to give us backstory whilst being overexcited at getting to the meat and indulging in that first in its prologue, it finally finds its stride. With our protagonists paired and the concept taking the reigns, it's pretty easy going stuff to just witness happening after such a slow pace, though it still gives us backstory to other characters. In fact, you end up dreading the inevitable downfall and sincerely hope the landing isn't too harsh after the hardships we tread through with them before. The music here is nothing particularly special, but it has an authenticity and a heart that shines through. It may be on-the-nose, but it adds so much to the characters and atmosphere to the air. Such great moments such as the performance on the rooftop when Hailee Steinfeld joins in the band.Knightley is radiant and tender, with only a few misteps where she slips into clichés that don't suit the character. Ruffalo's rugged nearly-homeless feel meets groans initially, but he rubs off on you and becomes the film's firm backbone. Maroon 5's Adam Levine sounds alarm bells at first but he's actually okay, performing music that's closest to his roots when his band was actually listenable. At least he's self-deprecating in the role making him somewhat endearing. British comedian James Corden is the antidote to any ills the film may have though. Begin Again may be rough around the edges and flawed, but it's a thoroughly charming film with a big heart. Its emotion works, but really it's mostly nice to see films of this topic. It may not exactly be Inside Llewyn Davis but it's more therapeutic company.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Lovely Song,"I walked out of this movie feeling like I was young all over again! When Dan's ears picked up in the bar, I was in perfect sync as well. The tune was pure magic and you would never know that Greta was anything other than an inspired writer. What I love most about Americans is their unbelievable entrepreneurial spirit and this is in evidence in spades here. I remember reading an autobiography about Twyla Tharp, a famous choreographer. She said something to the effect that ""those who the gods seek to punish, they give infinite resources"". This is the theme of this movie and why sometimes even if you are at the bottom of the barrel, it may be the best place to be from a creativity point of view. I loved all the characters in this film, they felt totally natural. Keira Knightley was a perfect Greta, unaffected and innocent. Mark Ruffalo was also very believable, someone who life had dealt many terrible hands, but rises about it all putting all the misery behind him and grabbing the riches of life in the present. Violet was a great guitarist, CeeLoo Green made me feel happy and Steve was the friend everyone wishes they had. Right on.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Attention Music-loving New York freaks! A good film you must watch!,"Begin Again is what you would call a ""good"" film. just good and nothing more. The story of a chic British girl with a unique music talent and a messed-up but somehow genius New York music producer filmed with a cool ""New York"" theme will amaze any one with a keenness towards New York. You probably have seen a lot of ""New York""s in this review so far, but this is how New Yorkish the film actually is! Of course if like me your utopia is New York then you would be just fine, but the emphasize on the city theme might actually wear the rest down.The gathering of good and some great songs in the film with just a brush of style and chicness of characters might just be what you need to watch this film; but surprisingly it has more to offer! The insights given on relationships might be one of its strong suits. Take the father daughter relationship portrayed in the picture; It is not following any of the clichés you are seeing in the films these days, It's actually quite more realistic and believable.Begin Again is a story about second chances. without getting into details, (but of course you can get this from the title, duh!) you are going to see a different take on a lot of things where you haven't seen much before and I think you are going to be wooed that way.I am sure no admirer of this picture would want to read these, but the film has some flaws also. The desperate film references made in the beginnings of the film mixed with the ""Lost in Translation""-like vibes it's trying to send is actually not working. Add this to the plot holes you're easily going to figure out and it might actually lose some marks! Hats off to Keira Knightley, but I can't think of Mark Ruffalo as the cool hip hop or punk or pop music producer, he is more of a Justin Bieber kind of a guy to me!But all in all, I would say this sentence one more time: Begin Again is a good film and I think a lot of New York freaks or music lovers are going to enjoy a film like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
An odd couple make beautiful music together by going a different path their own way!,"""Begin Again"" is one of those heart feel type movies that after you watch you will feel refreshed and uplifted. True it's a drama that blends emotion and starting over in life when your down in the dumps, but hey a lot of people have had to do that at some point or the other. Set in New York city it follows the life of Dan(Mark Ruffalo) who's an alcoholic and a washed up past his prime music executive. And Dan has plenty of problems he's divorced from his wife Miriam(Catherine Keener)and even though he has a daughter he sees this little miss Violet(the up and coming Hailee Steinfeld)is a head strong and easy sexy colored bra wearing young lady who likes to march to her own beat. Anyway by a chance encounter Dan meets Gretta(Keira Knightley)who's a young singer who's going thru a struggle after her now famous boyfriend has left her to sing on the big stage. Soon it's evident that Dan sees talent in Gretta and one by one beautiful music is made together the tunes are different and maybe low key yet it strikes a winning note thru emotion and love.

"Sweet, but Unspectacular,","Begin Again is a good movie with a well developed plot and a talented cast. Mark Ruffalo is, without any doubt, the saving grace of the film, he delivers a truly pure and honest performance, delivering a very vulnerable, tragic character that we do feel for and support as the plot progresses and his character grows.I will admit, I was expecting something more original and fresh from John Carney, the visionary writer and director behind Once and Sing Street. However, I could not help but feel an overabundance of studio involvement in this film, there was something holding it back from being different, something preventing it from standing out.Keira Knightley is quite bland in this film, I do generally enjoy her as an actress, but I feel she did not manage to play a normal person. She suits a strong female lead, such as in Pirates of the Caribbean, or a quirky female, like in Seeking a Friend for the End of the World, but I was never convinced by her as a normal, ambitious, conflicted human, and her chemistry with Ruffalo simply felt forced.Had potential, but lacking in originality. Unfortunately dull, Begin Again failed to sweep me away, worth the watch if you are looking for a good romance, but do not expect anything phenomenal.A chance encounter leads a male and a female to feel reinvigorated in their careers by collaborating with one another.Best Performance: Mark Ruffalo",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Jump on the train, and take it with All of The Beautifully Hurt People in Begin Again. I've recommended it to many. I bought it. I've watched it so many times, and then I don't, and then time passes, and it pops up again, and I watch it, thinking I'll get bored, only to find myself looped into it all over again, like it's fresh and new, and the spiral of watching it again and again, Begin's Again.

"A light, enjoyable and well made rom-com","John Carney's Once was a low budget film with a lovely message, a message that subsequently saw the film become a success the world over, an Oscar winner for Best Original Song and now a tale adapted into a stage musical, so Carney's next high profile venture was always going to be judged somewhat in comparison to his hit but thankfully Begin Again can be easily recommended despite not hitting the high notes of that Once did.It would be hard to defend Begin Again from those that call it a little naff or sugary but it would also be hard for them to say it's a film that has no charm for this tale is one that will bring a smile to your face if you let it and has a message within it that no matter how many times we see it portrayed is still relevant to us as humans. It's interesting that Carney has once more set his tale around music and where Once soared in its tunes Begin Again merely entertains in this stake and it's more than likely due to a less experienced singer in Keira Knightly being at the helm rather than esteemed talents like Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová but it's not to say the leads in this tale are any less engaging.While Knightly struggles to convince as a singer/songwriter she has some fine moments in her non singing parts, her Gretta a likable presence when she could've quite easily become a grating one. The star of the show here really is Mark Ruffalo however who continues to produce quality turn after quality turn and while he may not get the recognition as some of his counterparts there is little doubt that his one of the most consistent actors in the business today with his miserable yet not undeservedly so record label owner Dan another of his fine creations. While singers Adam Levine, Mos Def and Cee-Lo Green don't add much to the overall tone of the film other supports from Hailee Steinfeld and James Cordon do fine work but other than Ruffalo the best character here is by far New York city itself with Carney capturing the metropolis in one of the finest ways in recent memory, it truly does feel like a living breathing member of the cast.A feel good movie that does exactly what the doctor ordered, Begin Again is something we've all seen before but it's something done with enough flavour of its own that it's by no means ever tedious or intrepid and with some likable characters and a story that thankfully plays out exactly how it should by avoiding many a cliché. Quick, breezy and effective, Begin Again is middle range movie making at its most recommendable.3 outdoor recordings out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Once"" twice: does lightning strike again?","""Begin Again"" (2013 release; 100 min.) brings the story of Greta (played by Keira Knightley) and Dan (played by Marc Ruffalo). As the movie opens, we find Greta reluctantly going on stage in a small bar venue to play a song, urged on by a friend. By complete coincidence Dan, a veteran of the music business, is in the audience, and loves what he's hearing. We later learn the background of how these two characters ended up in that very place, as things have not been going as planned (and I'm being mild). Dan tells her he wants to record an album with/for her. Along the way we get to know the side characters (Dan's wife and 14 yr. old daughter--both estranged from Dan), and Dave (played by Maroon 5's Adam Levine), Greta's boyfriend who has just hit the big time. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: as a general matter and contrary to apparently many other reviewers, I did not ""fall"" for this movie like I did for ""Once"", writer-director John Carney's previous tale of romance and music. In fact, when it comes down to it, this movie is nothing more that a re-imagined ""Once"", set in a different city and with different leads, but in the end it is nothing more than a variation of what we've already seen. Lightning does not strike again: as sincere and moving and impossible Once was, as contrived and unoriginal and self-evident Begin Again is. There are still a couple of great scenes in the movie, reason I'm giving it 5 stars out of 10, and which I cannot describe in more details so as not to give away anything.And then just when you've think you've seen it all, comes the ending of the movie. Wow, just wow. The irony of it all. (For more details, please see my comments in the movie's discussion threat here on IMDb, under ""The Ending (spoilers obviously)"".",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Sweetly real and positive,"I only saw it because MArk Ruffalo was in it. He always brings great things to each role. I was expecting nothing from the movie, but maybe some good songs. It was refreshingly low key and real. To be perfectly clear I am not a musician and don't know the intricacies of singing/recording. I just enjoy music and listen to a lot and know the sounds I enjoy, So it may be not great singing/music, but I enjoyed it.Love movies as well and this was very good. I loved every part of it. The acting was straight on as was the plot. There was no giant twist at the end, which I am grateful for, but the ending was surprising. Kiera's voice was surprisingly pleasing, or, at least unexpectedly. The plot and story lines were straightforward, but they threw some time- line change ups to make it interesting in the beginning.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Total harmony between music and film, and smart too","How is John Carney the only filmmaker who knows how to make a contemporary musical? The ""Once"" filmmaker recaptures some of that film's magic in ""Begin Again,"" a more mainstream approach for a wider American audience. With a team of terrific songwriters and a top-notch cast, ""Begin Again"" is a welcome reminder of why and how much we love music.Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo star as a singer/songwriter and indie music producer, respectively, who both meet one night after the worst day of their lives. Ruffalo's Dan is an alcoholic separated from his wife who gets fired from the music label he built and Knightley's Gretta was just dumped by her rising music star boyfriend, Dave (Adam Levine). Dan is convinced Gretta's the one who can turn his fortunes around, and the two take a chance on each other and endeavor on a recording project that defies traditional music industry practice.So much of ""Begin Again"" rides on the music. The primary trio of writers, Gregg Alexander (lead singer of The New Radicals), Danielle Brisebois (writer of Natasha Bedingfield hits ""Unwritten"" and ""Pocketful of Sunshine"") and Nick Lashley craft accessible but definitively indie acoustic pop tracks that create both moments of emotional introspection and total feel-good vibes throughout the film. It's the soundtrack that really allows the film to soak in and become so easy to enjoy.That's why Carney's story works a little better than expected. The relationship that evolves between Dan and Gretta is a little strange and awkward, but both characters start at the bottom of the barrel and undergo personal redemption as they continue to collaborate; the music proves to have a transformative effect on their lives. Carney is fascinated with the way music impacts those who make it, and how it can literally change people's feelings and influence their actions. It's this reason that he also understands the role music plays in a film, that a film and a story can become something more in a symbiotic relationship with the music rather than a relationship in which one is clearly second to the other and merely complements it.Ruffalo and Knightley are also the right kind of performers to help achieve the synthesis of story and song. They bring such soul to their roles. Ruffalo's strength has always been hard to pinpoint, but in ""Begin Again,"" authenticity emerges as his strong suit. Dan is deeply troubled, but also hopeful and intensely passionate. Ruffalo helps ground the movie with his performance, bringing something raw and dramatic to a film that could've been a breezy musical romance in the wrong hands. Knightley too is terrifically cast. Gretta is a true artist repulsed by fame, who loves music in just the purest way a person can. If she were too much of a flashy Hollywood actress, her character wouldn't have been as credible.That's a stark contrast to Levine, who in his film debut plays the antithesis to Gretta, a man too swept up in the fame and spectacle of performing that he loses sight of (what Carney believes to be) the truth of music. As a the writer of radio hit pop songs with little substance and a TV personality, Levine's superficial persona (as soulful of a guy as he might truly be) helps create the dichotomy of the music industry as Carney sees it. A Cee Lo Green cameo also has a similar effect, though in his character's case, he helps to fill out Dan's back story. So these music stars do more than simply pad the cast in order to drum up interest in the movie.""Begin Again"" has a lot to say about music and the industry; Carney does not separate his beliefs from the story. The music is truly the main character and the antagonist is anyone who tries to manipulate it from it's most authentic form: the raw, earnest expression of human emotion. This belief dictates a quite a bit of the story and ultimately what happens in the film. Carney's not the kind of filmmaker who will simply wrap things up in that cheesy escapist romantic comedy way. So those looking for total musical Hollywood bliss might not totally understand ""Begin Again,"" but for the artists, music-lovers and creative types, it's a thoughtful film that's almost impossible not lap up.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Excellent film on many levels,"I haven't reviewed a film on IMDb in many years, but Begin Again has so much to recommend it I had to weigh in. This movie is the definition of a pleasant surprise, with excellent acting, surprisingly good music, and a plot that doesn't give in to the typical Hollywood ending. I watched this with three couples, all 40+, and everyone loved it. It also ignited a robust and lengthy conversation about the deeper meaning of the plot... which is an almost certain sign that the film hit an emotional note with its audience.Spoiler alert! The climactic scenes leave us with a somewhat ambiguous ending, especially as it relates to the relationship between Gretta and Dave. Dave's interpretation of Gretta's song seems to make it clear to both that their differing musical visions leave them ultimately incompatible... and it appears they both recognize this. But looking at this film from a different angle shows that it also serves as a powerful metaphor for the different directions that are tearing at the music industry today, with Dave representing the high powered star making machine that emphasizes profit over artistry, and Gretta representing the indie style artist that believes that music should remain the driving motive, with the internet disintermediating the cost-laden, hit-focused legacy music industry. In the final scene at Dave's concert, they both realize that they personally, as well as the direction of the industry they each represent are both violently incompatible.No one vision of the industry is clearly right or wrong, nor is there a singular interpretation of what happened between Dave and Gretta. But it's that ambiguity that makes this such a compelling story in the first place. Make up your own mind, or just watch this for what it is... a well acted, interesting story backed by some really good music. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Loving glances,"Begin Again is a sweet movie about the fragility of love. How it can be there one moment and gone the next. Gretta (Keira Knightley) and Dave (Adam Levine) were bound together with the struggle to make it in the music world and mutual infatuation. Suddenly Dave makes it and moves on while leaving Gretta behind. In comes in Dan (Mark Ruffalo) and sees potential in her music. Dan has his own love troubles and dealing with a stagnant career as a music executive. Dan is the ultimate ""Mr. Nice Guy"". Lots of loving glances and creative innocence is experienced on the big screen and this tale is about self discovery and the complexity of dealing with change. Regardless of what life throws at you, you got to believe in your dreams and move forward because in the end it all works out. Overall it is a feel good movie of the normal lives of regular folks who are struggling to make it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Such an infectiously authentic feel-good film!,"Carney proves that tackling familiar story and using tons of clichés are the last things that should be concerned about as long as the film is made with self-awareness and immense passion; and that Mark Ruffalo is capable of fleshing out his character quite readily, that Keira Knightley is capable of singing with a voice so pure it goes straight to your heart and that they both, surprisingly, have a rare dynamic. He also proves that films cannot only be seen, but also listened to.(8.5/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Sing a Song of Love,"This film is recommended.Its title is doesn't say much, almost seeming like a sweet afterthought but a necessary means of identification without any real meaning. That too sums up the movie, Begin Again. This low- budget independent film charts the meeting of two mismatched lovers who never appear to be soul-mates. It's as if their only connection is the song, which also is the only driving force in this semi-love story.Dan (Mark Ruffalo) is a washed-up music producer whose life has seen better times. He is estranged from his wife and teenage daughter. Gretta (Keira Knightley) is a soulful songwriter, newly heart-broken by her recent break-up with her successful musician boyfriend. Dan and Gretta meet and join forces to record a live musical album. They begin to bond and sort out their personal demons.Begin Again tries to avoid predictability at all cost, but its non-predictability becomes its main calling card. The film has a nice soundtrack, filled with lovely original music. (Especially memorable is its theme song, Lost Stars.) Were that its screenplay had the same insight and passion. The script by the director, Jim Carney (Once), lightly touches on some character development but rarely delves deeply with their self-destructive behavior or dramatic situations: Dan drinks heavily and behaves erratically, but has that special gift of spotting new talent. Gretta lacks confidence and doubts herself as a performer, never wanting to ""sell-out"". As written, both characters remain sketchy and come to terms with their issues matter-of-factly.Begin Again relies heavily on the actors to supply the missing ingredients. Fortunately, Carney has cast his film with top talent. There is an underlying chemistry with Knightly and Ruffalo. The actors bring the needed believability to their roles. It is in the film's quieter moments that their relationship shines, words not said, the actors' pauses and subtle stares, their boding during the film's improvisational musical scenes. This is where the film connects with the audience. (Ms. Knightley does some fine vocalizing too.) Strong support is also given by James Corden, Hailee Steinfeld, Cathleen Keener, and Adam Levine.Can a Song Save Your Life? was the original title of the film. Perhaps a more apt name could have been Can a Song Save Your Movie? The answer is yes, especially with its two charismatic leads serenading moviegoers. Begin Again is worth a listen.

"Beautiful movie, for every music lover out there and lover of charming movies","I loved this movie. I went to see reviews and was astounded that some gave it less than 7, so I had to make my first IMDB review. This movie is so charming, dialog is realistic and story line is so well executed. This is a movie about friendship, family, love and of course music. Relationship between father and daughter was well done. Keira acting is perfect, her and Ruffalo's chemistry is palpable. You fall in love with every character in this movie, no matter how small. Usually I am not a huge fan of Corden, but in this movie he was amazing as a good friend of Keira's character Gretta, anyone would wish for. I understand this movie is not for everyone but if you like slow, charming movies, see this one. Songs were lovely in this movie, especialy their arrangment but I must say I'm not a big fan of Keira's voice, she isn't after all a trained singer and you could hear that. I think that aspect could have been better. But other than that, lovely movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Summer music in the air,"Quickie Review:Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a record label executive is forced to quit his company after being unwilling to compromise on the integrity of the music he produced, for higher sales. Meanwhile, Gretta (Keira Knightley) is a young songwriter cheated on by her college sweetheart Dave (Adam Levine), who is consumed by his new rock-star status. Gretta and Dan meet each other by chance, and the two of them become partners to produce an album to the sounds of Manhattan. Begin Again is a charming little movie about redemption, friendship, and of course music. It is filled with likable characters, witty dialog, and is in the end an uplifting story. While I can't say the movie is original, the chemistry between Ruffalo and Knightley alone was enough to make me enjoy it overall.Full Review:The director of Begin Again, John Carney, had previously directed another music focused movie called Once, which I really loved. So for that reason, I was excited to see his latest work. While it doesn't live up to his previous film, Begin Again is still worth a watch.The stand out performance for me is Mark Ruffalo. From the first scene it is obvious that his character Dan, is not exactly well put together. He is lazy, messy, an alcoholic, also he comes late to meetings and has damaged relationship with his daughter and separated wife. Yet it is his passion for music that shows that there is much more to this man. And he feels the same way about Gretta, that there is a talent that he sees in her that must be shown to the rest of the world. They find a kindred spirit in each other as they work together on the music album. An aspect I love about this movie, is that it is not a love story, or at least in the typical romantic movie sense. Carney could have taken the obvious easy route and just made this a romantic story of Dan and Gretta. Instead it focuses on all the other relationships the two leads have with the supporting cast. In that sense the way the story deals with love between characters is pleasantly charming and unique because it can't be easily labeled.As it is music oriented, I should of course comment on that. Just like movies, music is very subjective, so I won't say that everyone will enjoy the music in this movie. I personally like indie rock so Begin Again soundtrack was a perfect fit for me. If it so happens that you don't enjoy such music, I can at least assure you that the actors involved have a good voice, of course Adam Levine is no surprise in that matter. I should mention though that Levine surprised me with his acting talent. He is no thespian, but he was very natural in his delivery, so props to him.My main problem with this movie is that I feel like I have seen this all before. There is very little risk taken, and you know exactly what is going to happen. So it ends up being that the whole entertainment factor lands on the characters and the dialog. Thankfully, these two aspects is where Begin Again excels and saved the movie. If you are looking for a smart, charming, summer feel-good movie, this is the one for you.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Pleasant but insubstantial.,"I was late to the party on this one. Begin Again had a 'blink and you'll miss it' release and I did. It's not hard to see why: though it is warmly entertaining, it is, ultimately, flimsy and unmemorable.Written and directed by John Carney, whose biggest hit to date remains 2006's Once, Begin Again shares a similar theme: a couple making music and discovering themselves.Gretta (Keira Knightley) accompanies her musician boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) to New York when he signs a deal with a major record deal. But while the world glows for him, Gretta soon finds herself the first casualty of his new-found fame and wandering Manhattan alone, but for the company of old friend and busker, Steve (James Cordon). By chance, she is thrown together with disgraced record label executive Dan (Mark Ruffalo) and, astounded by her raw talent, he signs her up for a quirky musical collaboration around New York City.And therein lies my biggest issue with Begin Again: Dan is astounded by Gretta's talent, I wasn't. Yes, it is pleasant, her singing is easy on the ear and her lyrics are several ranks higher than the Cheeky Girls, but she's no Leonard Cohen.Like Gretta's musical output, Begin Again is twee, easy and simple, it is moving wallpaper that doesn't cause any offence. We've seen it before, we've enjoyed it more and last time around, in Once, Carney didn't dilute it. It strikes me that Carney has poured this one out to satisfy the teeny audiences who were told they should have loved Once but just didn't get it.Knightly is fine, Ruffalo is as good as ever, Cordon is slightly less over the top than usual. The plot is simple, the father/daughter subplot is obvious, everything is laid out very carefully for the audiences that need life explained fully for them to understand. Begin Again is all just a little bit plinky plonk, it is obvious and idealistic and, particularly in the instance of the family dancing sequence, plain embarrassing.I love the idea of a group of musicians recording an album in the open around New York but there has to be a far better way of presenting it to the world.Pleasant but insubstantial. Begin Again? Please don't.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Mark Ruffalo,"I have not seen all Mark Ruffalo's movies, but his performance in this is brilliant. Sometimes, the value of a movie is based on particular exceptional parts as a genuine representation of a not so unusual real life character. Even if the role itself is boring as a movie script, Mark has managed to surpass the so called reasons of his behavior based on the scenario and let us embrace the scenes as they were happening in front of our eyes. The rating is so high for his effortless mastery on this film.PS: I am not a fanboy of Mark Ruffalo, so maybe he has better acting momment that I am not familiar with, but I am glad that there are really good actors who can have a level of excellence in common roles and not in role-of-my-life movies that the characters are made to intrigue.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I might even compare it to a Kubrick movie for its use of music as a mood- setting character. KK has never been more raw, honest and winning, Ruffalo always nails it and Corden takes his first bow! The establishing scene where Ruffalo first encounters Knightley and imagines her simple, acoustic song in the hands of an experienced and talented producer is thrilling and sets the enchanting tone for the rest of the movie.

"""Begin Again"" is ""Once"" again but better","I loved this movie. From beginning to end, a smile rarely left my face. OK, so it's essentially a remake of ""Once"" (2007) with the same writer and director (Irishman John Carney) and the same story (a man and a younger woman from another country meeting in a major city of the guy's nation and uniting to create unconventional music). I actually enjoyed ""Begin Again"" more than ""Once"". The earlier film was shot on an almost non-existent budget with camcorders, whereas this one has a decent budget and much more professional production values; I think New York is snazzier than Dublin (I've been to both about half a dozen times); and Mark Ruffalo as the guy and Keira Knightley as the girl are much better actors than ... (exactly - who remembers them?).The movie has a smart opening with beautiful Knightley as the British singer- songwriter Gretta giving an open-mic performance of one of her songs before meeting charming Ruffalo as a washed-up American A & R man Dan before the film backtracks twice to show us how each of these very different characters came to be at this place at this time. In a similar fashion to my wife (who can view a room and mentally refurnish and even redesign it), Dan can visualise how Geta's song would come over with full backing musicians and a revised arrangement.The songs - written by Gregg Alexander of New Radicals - are good, but it is Knightley who is the surprise. Although she is married to a rock and roll player, she is outside of her comfort song here, but she learned to play the guitar for the role and sings well (as indeed she did in ""The Edge Of Love"").",,Anonymous,Music

I watched it again recently and I still feel the same.,"Music changes life ... ordinary and warm stories, I like the ending very much, because the male and female protagonists love each other because of music, there is no stereotype, but they return to their own trajectories and continue to move forward. I feel that Keira Knightley is particularly suitable for this role. She also wears beautiful clothes, and she is particularly attractive every time she smiles. I especially like her taste of acting, ""Pride and Prejudice"" will always be my favorite movie to watch her movies. I like the character of the heroine of this movie too! Even if the scumbag comes back, it is over, and the communication with Dan is only this step. Dan actually played the Hulk! I have never found it before! He plays such a nervous uncle! The songs in it are also a must listen to my music library before! Sure enough, there is still a dream, and the process of realizing the dream is really happy!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Settle With Music,"Begin Again tends to take things light and easy, despite of its harsher first act. It introduces its main characters falling down from their careers as they face the unfair reality of the music industry. Dan seeks for actual good music but the production keeps on feeding everyone the awfulness of modern mainstream because the mass would sadly swallow it no matter what, while Greta has gone to a typical celebrity relationship which won't last that long (apparently). The first thirty-minutes or so pours out the worst until they immediately find the solution to get up again. The plot sometimes move too simple, but what consists in those scenes however bring a real heart to music which easily makes the audience sway from some of its obvious flaws.Some might expect some commentary since the beginning keeps poking fun of today's popular music, but it didn't took that long. Instead of petty satires, it rather makes music as a way of expressing their various feelings. Their problems may be solved far too easy which makes the steps of the journey feel kind of underwhelming, but how they define their affections towards the music deeper than what the storyline was trying to suggest. The lead characters are given some genuine personality which makes their bonding moments wonderfully down-to-earth.The direction contemplates and perfectly follows the rhythm of the playing songs at the scenes. The songs are fine, few might be considered as memorable but they are all appealing anyway. Keira Knightly isn't known for singing, but she nicely carries her character's emotions through it, also of course at the acting. Mark Ruffalo manages to be all likable in his redeeming washed-up producer role. The rest of the cast also brims some life in their background.The risk of ""beginning again"" is probably too little, basically because passion to music could easily find the end of the tunnel of their sudden misery. Its eventual sheer positivity can be both a good and a bad thing. The good side is it stays true to what it is wanted to say. But still, they're still burdened with some heavy personal issues that doesn't get enough consideration, but whatever I guess. The sub-themes and all; it still delivers its message sincerely and it can be quite a charming thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

A great soundtrack and good performances make up for the story's flaws,"Begin Again tells the story of a hapless music producer at the end of his rope and his discovery of a broken hearted indie musician who has raw talent and a bit of a mouth on her. Starring Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley, Begin Again has no shortage of talent both on and off screen but the film's story is a jumbled and incoherent mess told in very jolting ways that almost seem as if they were meant to confuse the audience. Written and Directed by Once's John Carney, the film suffers from narrative flaws much like his previous film but has enough charisma to carry us through to the finish line. Begin Again has the look and feel of indie just with a big budget cast and Adam Levine doing the soundtrack. It is really well done in regards to the look and feel of the film but it has a hard time telling its story and becomes muddled in its third and final act which almost crumbles the film if it wasn't for Ruffalo and Knightley. Like I said, the performances in this film are actually really good considering it is packed full of pop stars. Levine does a fine job playing himself in this film, a pretentious musician with a voice unlike any other. Cee Lo Green makes an appearance but ultimately feels more like a plot device than an actual real character in the film. Mark Ruffalo as Dan is a blast to watch, he is a complete jerk but in a way that you can't help but love him. His fast paced way of telling it how it is between clove cigarettes and sips of a flask is nothing short of enjoyable. Carney's screenplay is an absolute jumbled mess and if it wasn't for the excellent soundtrack and montages that accompany the music, I'd probably give it a lower rating. The characters are well written, the dialog was outstanding but the overall structure of the story is poorly done. Carney has a hard time with transitions here, and his editing choices are questionable to say the least. Hard cuts in the middle of scenes, and sudden jumps in time make for a very jumbled experience that could have been saves if it was just edited with a bit more finesse. Despite this, it is still a fresh take on the musical genre and does resemble Carney's previous film Once but this film has a bit more of a lighter feel to it than that. Overall, Begin Again is a jumbled mess saved by two great performances from Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightly along with an awesome soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

All Playing Together Like One Big Happy Family,"starred in films that were a bit more meaningful than this load of trash. Anyway, didn't the Partridge Family already cover this material in 4 seasons and 96 obnoxious television episodes featuring an annoying family performing in random venues as well as their garage? Don't the Cowsills get any credit here? At least the Archies were a cartoon band and didn't tarnish their acting careers like Ruffalo and Knightley do in this dreadful production. The guitarist twanging a collection of sour notes containing multiple special audio effects to hide the actual proficiency of musical talent made me cringe.

I suppose this was a way for the everyone in the production to let loose and have a good time but it felt like having to watch a bad episode of The Monkees again and again. Hopefully this film and all the worn out conventions and superficial heart rending plot devices will take a nose dive with this so we never have to view this kind of entertainment ever again. At least the neck stubble and self importance of Adam Levine were offensive enough to let us see him for what he really is.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

A Song Can Change Your Life,"I'm big fan of Mark Ruffalo and i wanted to watch this movie for so long, but i thought it would disappoint me.

The Magic is in the Music,"I was changing channels, there was nothing playing on the other station. So I literally had no idea what I was getting into, or what I had missed.Oh look, it's Mark Ruffalo ordering some bourbon in a bar. He doesn't even care what label. He looks like he doesn't care when he last changed his underwear. His ears perk up as a pretty singer begins her song. He's immediately rapt while he drunkenly stands before her, waving arms about. We hear what he hears: a violin plays, drums come in, a guitar plays while she sings. Now he has a reason in his being, he is inspired.After her song is finished, they converse a while. It turns out he's a disgraced A&R producer who has hit bottom and he wants to bring her music to life. She's naturally skeptical, but he manages to convince her. And in a moment of clarity, he tells her of his idea of how to bring this about.There is a kind of sadness in this movie, where everyone has had their rock-bottom moment, but participation in the project lifts everyone to a new level. The music is heart-felt. The performances by the cast are right on and enjoyable.Here's hoping you enjoy this as much as I did.",,Anonymous,Music
"The song is the cake, icing and cherry on top","I think it's safe to say we were all pleasantly surprised to hear that Keira Knightley can sing. It was what attracted me to this film in the first place. The songs were just incredible. Every single one of them. And the story was well, a near perfect feel good. But ultimately, the songs was what made an otherwise very good feel good into a near perfect one.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
6/10,"Quirky, light-hearted and simplistic to a fault, despite screaming to be likable and sweat the movie ends up being a light mess that had me actually a little angry when I thought back about it. All the mistakes it mad were easily avoidable, but it fell into them and became an average romantic film, instead of being something particular.For every positive point I think about ""Begin Again"" a negative immediately takes its place and even though it isn't what I wanted because I really wanted to like this movie, that's the way it went down. I have to point out that despite all the flaws I'll list ahead I had a kind of good time, especially because of the music that had really high production value and quality and surely because of the comedic aspects of the film; it definitely had success in making me laugh. So, the film starts out fairly strong, it never ever had me hooked or really interested in any of the characters, but the first and first-half of the second acts had a really good flow to them. Unfortunately after the movie hits a little over mid-way point is simply starts to crumble down piece by piece and gets what could have been a 7.5 to a 6. It becomes overly sentimental and messy, but moreover the more the film goes on the more it approaches the world in a totally surreal way and keeps trivializing reality with a light-heartiness that became annoying. Most importantly, ""Begin Again"" is a total failure in fact of clichés. It chooses to avoid the one that could have worked and uses the totally wrong and out of context ones.Now to the cast: the first thought that came to mind when I read the cast list was ""wow, impressive"" and they certainly are and all used in good ways, no one has highlights but no one has weaknesses and they all contribute to th . Except for one. Many have talked about the two leads' chemistry. Whist I may mildly agree that they work together well I thought that Keira Knightly was totally miss-cast. I am not a Knightly hater, I actually think she really has some acting chops, but from frame one of this movie I never bought her as her character until the end. It's not really because of her performance, which isn't anyway extraordinary, but I really didn't see her fit in this role. On the contrary Mark Ruffalo was very good and worked really well, even if the material wasn't top notch.I think this could have been a much better movie, but still it had its moments and fun.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Exploring the highs and lows of the music industry,"Begin Again explores the fictional New York music industry, highlighting themes of love, fame and the impact of music.First to the plot. I appreciate the non-linear storytelling in the first half of the movie to show the character's paths and how their pasts lead them to this bar where their worlds change for the better. The music written and delivered in this film is top notch, with Adam Levine delivering great vocal performances that uplifts the quality of the movie. There are a few character connections and past moments that are left for the audience to guess, but if you can get past the desire to know everything about the characters, you'll enjoy this film wholeheartedly.Mark Ruffalo delivers a genuine performance as the lead, and is by far the stand out. Keira Knightley is great, and it's good to see her outside of costume dramas for once, her singing isn't half bad either.The film definitely has that family film feeling that'll leave you appreciating the time you took out of your day to watch it.

Good performances elevate this slow story,"When compared to Once, the incredibly high bar set by the director in his feature debut, Begin Again seems quite disappointing. It lacks the intimacy and unique atmosphere created by once. But When compared to other films out there, begin again is more than serviceable. It is naturalistic, realistic, and even has its own unique atmosphere created by a well filmed New York at night. The lead performances are good and they seem genuine, as if Knightley and Ruffalo are just being themselves. The story is also well crafted- it avoids the usual pitfalls of having the two leads eventually kiss and make out, for in real life, non- romantic relationships do exist. But ultimately I think like Once, the pacing here is too slow for my taste. The movie takes almost a full hour just to explain the backstories of our two main characters, and in the end the story here, like the story in Once, is perhaps too slight and not substantial enough. Sure, these simple, straightforward stories make very compelling, naturalistic films, but they lack the rhythm which I am used to. Begin again is a very good film which I don't like but can recommend- it's not my cup of tea, but I can see a good number of people liking it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Expected Better! 5/10,"Review: This is a sweat movie about a down and out alcoholic, music producer who hears a song in a bar and gets inspiration to make the singer famous. After getting turned down by his record producer, partner Mos Def, he decides to cut the album on the streets of New York with the help of a band, who works for free. The storyline did seem a bit jolly for my liking, but the performances were great by the whole cast, especially Mark Ruffalo. Each character brought something different to the project which made it a watchable film, but I did feel a bit empty at the end. Knightley's singing was quite impressive for a first timer, but her annoying grin and posh English accent became a bit tedious after a while. The director tried to bring some depth to the characters which all went out of the window once they went on the road, which was a shame. Anyway, it's worth a watch but it won't go down as a classic. Watchable!Round-Up: Maroon 5's lead singer, Adam Levine was a great addition to the cast and he seemed to burst into song with ease, even though it was his first starring role. Cee Lo also put in a good performance but I didn't understand why his friend started beat boxing for no reason. All the way through the film you get this tribute to New York, which I have seen in many Woody Allen and Martin Scorsese movies. Personally I think it's the stars that brought in the audiences, more than the concept because on paper, I don't think that this  movie would have worked if the director brought in some B actors.Budget: $8million Worldwide Gross: $64million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there road movies about a record producer who makes an album on the streets of New York with a first time singer. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Totally loved this,"I must be one of the few people on the planet that doesn't like Keira Knightley as an actor. But in Begin Again she's just brilliant to watch. She keeps the grinning to a minimum and the singing simple and unforced. Must be the director telling her to ease down on the acting and just keep it relaxed.
The story is about a burnt out but talented music exec who discovers what could be a new singing sensation. He's right of course but it's the journey they go on that makes this film such a joy.
The idea of discovering musicians these days is pure fantasy and the film can be seen as a comment on the terrible state of the music business. But it keeps things light and fun and the love story that bubbles under the surface plays out effectively but thankfully keeps the cliche to a minimum.
The part of the music exec must have been written for Mark Ruffalo as he is perfect and authentic.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Charming and surprisingly unsentimental romcom defies genre expectations,"Charming and surprisingly unsentimental romcom defies genre expectations. Keira Knightly plays a NYC songwriter who's just broke up with her singer boyfriend, Maroon 5's Adam Levine who cheated on her. While feeling down, a friend drags her to a small venue where he's performing and pushes her onto stage where she's discovered by a down on his luck record producer, Mark Ruffalo. The easy romcom path would either have Knightly and Ruffalo falling in love or would have the two learn and grow from each other and then find happiness with their respected partners. Instead, the film plays against conventions and it's quickly apparent to the audience that writer/director John Carney wants to make a much more realistic story of love, forgiveness, and redemption, where at the end of the day everything is not all neatly wrapped up in a bow. Knightly and Ruffalo appear more as real people dealing with real situations than your typical romcom characters. Their sincere performances bolster the strong strips and this realism of their characters and emotions give the film an earnestness that's missing from similar stories. ""Begin Again"" is also a celebration of music. From the heartfelt lyrics Knightly pours into her songs about her relationships or a magical moment early on in the film when Ruffalo listens to Knightly play a song on an acoustic guitar in a bar to an indifferent audience while he imagines added layers of drums, piano, guitars, and strings, seeing in his mind (along with the audience) what the song could become. The film is greatly helped in that this story of musicians, songwriters, and producers features songs that are actually good. These songs were written by Gregg Alexander and Glen Hansard of The New Radicals (""You Get What You Give""), and they are full of feeling that perfectly capture the pathos of the characters while at the same time are actual catchy tunes. There are also excellent supporting performances by James Corden as a fellow struggling musician friend of Knightley's, the always great Catherine Keener as Ruffalo's ex-wife, and Hailee Steinfeld as his moody daughter. Overall, ""Begin Again"" is not an earth shattering film, but it is a genuinely heartfelt story and celebration of music that really sneaks up on you with its earnestness.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Candid but Bland,"This movie shows how the two main characters, Greta and Dan, become to be able to ""begin again"" through the music and the inspiration they share with one another. Both characters had been hurt by their old ""love"", but this becomes a turning point for them, through a series of coincidences. This lets both of them to find their dream again and overcome their past.The overall aura (of the city and the music) and the insight that the movie permits is remarkable, although, I wish that the story and the characters should have been developed further. Some people even say that the movie is only a series of music videos that lacks detail in the construction of the plot. This makes the movie quite boring in some parts that don't have music. However, it didn't bother me so much, since it had a short running time, and the movie was enjoyable for the most part, including all the heart-warming songs and a great ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

everyone can learn how to pretend to play and instrument - except these guys,"Super easy to watch, the only problem is that it is a movie about musicians and the love for music, but the actors didn't even know how to PRETEND they were playing - or singing. The plot has its potential, it is a very pleasant story to watch when you don't want to think much neither have that wasted-time feeling. The attention to the details could have made this movie a lot better. In some scenes, the actors appeared to be playing the guitar when there was no guitar in the song, for example. Notes all wrong, I felt bad for the bassist's attempts. The times Keira's character was clearly not singing also bothered me. Still, I enjoyed watching it and I found myself fond of Adam Levine's voice - which has never happened before. In general, this could have been a better movie. The production is good, the photography is OK, the plot is very fine. Please, actors can learn how to pretend how to play an instrument, you just have to ask them to do it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

'Begin Again' Review,"If you love movies about music, filled with original songs from beginning to end, then you'd love ""Begin Again."" Mark Ruffalo plays Dan, a record producer who gets fired and lives estranged from his wife and daughter. Greta, played by Keira Knightley, is a musician who just said goodbye to love. When Greta's music attracts the ears of Dan, they decide to make music together, recording live sessions around the city of New York.It's a comedy-drama movie that promotes second chances, tied together with original songs.

Hidden insight in a rom com shell,"I almost didn't get to see this movie, missed it the first time round due to it's terrible name and marketing, and that would have been a loss to me because it's a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining movie about the art and pleasure of creativity. There are some brilliantly insightful and well presented scenes in this movie that are to do with how creativity happens and they really click with people who do this stuff, which is a rarity in cheesy ripoff Hollywood who would rather sensationalise simplify and adapt for dramatic value every true story and experience out there. In particular the scene where Mark Ruffalo's character imagines the production of a raw song rings exceptionally and insightfully true. I loved it, and his delivery is fantastic for it, as he buzzes of each imagined part he introduces. I loved the concept they gave the album, The movie isn't perfect but the delivery manages to gloss over the cliché boardroom meetings and hip hop star for laughs bits, the credits ending bit raises a bunch of complex issues it has no hope of dealing with in the space of the credit roll, But the bristly character deliveries ring true, due to the improvised dialogue approach, and the music is really really good, much better than we should expect for a movie about making music rather than a fully fledged pop album. And the movie was fun, in a time when every other movie is dark and depressing. This wins on so many levels.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Amazing film about the struggle to maintain our personality and moral code!,"What a brilliant vibe! Would you like to watch an emotionally rich and powerful story discussing sensitive human aspects with spikes of realism on a wallpainting of wonderfully romantic cinematography? Look no further! Very few words can do justice to the feeling you receive from viewing this film. At the end of it all, I felt justified, tears running down my eyes which I tried to conceal. It builds up so fully, colorfully and intensely like a great relationship that you never want to let go. Hate, anger, rage, confusion, sorrow, despair, agony, pity, compassion, hope, enthusiasm, humor, playfulness, groove, admiration, contentment and JOY, all depicted in such vivid and vibrant manner.The movie bursts with the scent of life and the living. It is a ""young"" movie and a movie about youth. A youth that is most and foremost idealistic. In refusal of sense and reason this mature and yet stubborn youth fails to abandon its true cause. Bringing forth a revolution of disarming honesty, pervasive directness and relentless provocation.Keira Knightley embodies a musician who has recently broken up with her boyfriend, also a musician who has reached the doorstep of commercial success and fame is affecting his character and life choices. She urges him to stay true to himself and manifests her faith in his good nature even as he betrays her somewhere along the line. Keira is struggling inside whilst every now and then radiating with confidence. She juggles to keep it all together, like women do. In the end she finds balance in her inviolable moral code. Her performance is peacefully astounding.Mark Ruffalo is spectacular. He delves so deep into this character I can argue that his performance is palpable. He peculiarly reminds me of Al Pacino in taxidriver (dont ask me why!). Perhaps it is the richness of his portrayal or the motion of Mark plays a lover of music, spent music producer and tormented family man who finds himself in the verge of losing faith to himself and others as he randomly comes across Keira performing in a bar as a favor to her friend. Purportedly he has a gift for discovering talented musicians. The magnificent blend of Mark and Keira that follows you will have to enjoy for yourself. Mark is set on a flaming, forceful and fulfilling orbit around Keira, borderline flirting with Keira who becomes his muse. Most crucially, they express their passion and turmoil in a zealous, heartfelt musical project validating their worth.Most excellent supporting performances from a prominent cast (Mos Def,Catherine Keener, James Corden, Hailee Steinfeld, CeeLo Green) and the remarkable directorship of John Carney endow this feature with a spontaneous and original ambiance. I likewise particularly enjoyed the photography even though on occasions it adopts some clichés.Begin again is beyond any shadow of doubt a film I will be watching again and again... :D",,Anonymous,Music
A love song to music,"Rather than a musical (where characters burst into sung dialogue) this is a movie about music: its very nature, it's creative spark, the bastardization of commercial music, how music elevates the mundane or just the magic of music to crystallize a moment. This is a love song to music. It is also a love song to New York. The story telling is all over the place because character arcs are not the point of the movie. There is some solid casting choices, nonetheless, and I'm pretty sure that Kiera Knightley, Mark Ruffalo (and, maybe, Adam Levine or a fledgling Hailee Steinfeld) were the hooks for the film. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Light Drama}",7.0,Anonymous,Music

A Total Delight,"I suddenly realised at the end of this movie that I had been sitting for the bulk of the two hours with a huge grin. Fortunately I was at home and not in a cinema. And that grin came from the fact that I had spent that time watching a real feel good film and yet one with a great storyline, beautifully drawn characters and lashings of heart. And of course lots of good music. All the performances are first class but the lead duo of Keiry Knightly and the sadly under rated Mark Ruffalo and the non physical relationship that they develop make this movie special. Because of the writer this will be compared to Once but if you didn't like Once, which I didn't, don't be put off.

Musical Serendipity,"Dan used to be an maverick indie record producer and family man. However, time and luck turn against him in both aspects of his life. Greta is an idealistic singer-songwriter whose musician boyfriend Dave went astray when he gets entangled with the glare and trappings of commercial fame.Dan and Greta meet each other at the very depth of their depression. But this fortuitous meeting would bring about a chain of events which may lead to a mutual reversal of fortunes for these two free-spirited individuals. Will these lost stars align once again with their collaboration?These backgrounds of the lead characters are reminiscent of writer- director John Carney's breakthrough 2006 indie film, the delicate ""Once."" The story was also about musicians who led sad lives until they meet and click musically. The storytelling was propelled by the beautiful songs they sing. In ""Begin Again"" though, Carney's first Hollywood film, the setting is upgraded from suburban Ireland to New York City, and the cast is upgraded to A-list stars.Mark Ruffalo perfectly captures the broken character of Dan, gruff exterior and deep-set cynicism. However, he has this goofy charm that makes you actually root for him to dig himself out of his hole. He seems to have genuine chemistry with all his co-stars, a rare quality.Keira Knightley started so well in her career, but lately her talent has not been given the right roles to shine. Greta is such an awesome character for Keira, who I am sure no one even thought could sing so well. Everything she sings here I liked and I would like to hear over and over. Beautiful songs all.Adam Levine plays the erring boyfriend Dave well considering this is his first major movie role. His singing was of course flawless in very catchy songs like the centerpiece tune ""Lost Stars"", which is this film's answer to ""Falling Slowly"" from ""Once"", certainly a contender for Oscar Best Song as well.James Corden plays Greta's best friend in New York Steve. He provides the comic relief very subtly, a very nice guy. Catherine Keener plays Dan's ex-wife Miriam, who made the most of her little screen time. Hailee Steinfeld plays Dan's confused daughter Violet. Cee-Lo also has a marked cameo as one of Dan's former successful talents.Like ""Once"", ""Begin Again"" is a film that is simply so refreshing and delightful midst all the big and noisy summer blockbusters. The story does not seem so original, that is true. However again, the unbelievably effective cast and the beautiful musical soundtrack both uplift the common story into a much higher level.

Wow! Love this movie. Total surprise.,"First off given the subject I expected the usual type of plot, find talented shy nobody and make them a star. So cliché and overdone, but I knew it was better than that from the festival reviews I read when it made the circuit. This movie has a very natural feeling to it. They did not overdo anything. That alone makes it amazing to me. They did not pull any cliché punches. Other than maybe Adam Levine's character is a jerk after he get's famous, but they even pulled that back in a way that felt realistic to me. Love Adam Levine's version of Lost Stars. I found out it was written by Greg Alexander, formerly from the New Radicals and Danielle Brisebois! Remember her, former child star? Well I have loved songs from both of them over the years, so I was happy when I found out they wrote this song. The acting was very good. Even the smallest parts seemed to be so well cast, like a group of kids who get pulled in to sing on the street. I am not a big fan of Keira Knightley but she did a very good job here and also she has a pretty good voice. It was effective. I pretty much love Mark Ruffalo in anything. James Corden did a great job as the friend. One thing that came through the screen was they all actually seemed to be having fun. That was nice. This movie was also so refreshing, no sex, no offensive stuff and about 4 swear words total. How rare is that? One of the best movies I have seen this year. Really a true feel good movie without clichés and stupid plot lines. Great job everyone. I hope you win best song at the Oscars so more people will go and see the movie. The little movie that could.

Her smile is really appealing and her delivery of the dialogue was superb as was the subtlety of her evanescent facial expressions. I liked the assertiveness and gentleness of her character too. Mark Ruffalo was excellent too, and the chemistry between the two that was really engaging. Keira is married to a real life rockstar. Her authenticity might have been enhanced by real life experience. I hope that was her singing because it was really good. She has total star quality and although Ruffalo was great too I could not take my eyes of Ms Knightly, not just because of her beauty but because of her acting skills and the clear projection of her voice. This movie is worth seeing and there were no guns, thank goodness. There was no violence either and very little bitterness. All this is very refreshing. Thanks to the people who made this entertaining show.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
CineSketches_Begin Again (2013 Hollywood),"Size and Scale: Fits All! 'Must Watch' in a theater while you pay for friends and family! Home collection too! 10 on 10!CineScope: One of the best Hollywood musicals of recent times. Very successful / talented Dan's (Mark Ruffalo) career is nose-diving along side a troubled marriage, making him alcoholic. Gretta (Kiera Knightly) who has devoted her teen / young life for her boyfriend's career but who has cheated on her. It's about Dan and Gretta's struggle and then beginning again successfully in their respective lives with unparalleled passion and conviction.BFB (Bang For the Buck): Must watch for the songs, for songs Kiera sung and enacted on screen, for Mark Ruffalo's drunkard but a very passionate song producer. For the wonderful chemistry between both of them and for lots of beautiful tracks that will last in your memories forever.My High! Incidentally both are songs: 1. Song 'A Step You Can't Take Back': Cut 1: At a bar Gretta was pushed by her friend to sing this even though she is not prepared, and she sings beautifully w/o any supporting instruments. Cut 2 – Dan in the audience at the same bar, the very moment, heavily drunk, having a great ear for the music, immediately picks up this song, and starts composing it adding and orchestrating various instruments IN HIS MIND. Directorial marvel! And he thus sees a Superstar in Gretta 2. Song 'Like a Fool': Comes at an emotional turning point in Gretta's life. Just the light bass guitar, subtle keyboard and Kiera Knightley's soft but very sad voice and equally deep portrayal of emotions. Unforgettable!ScreenEsha Speaks: At least 2 Oscar nominations and most likely a win at 2015 Academy Awards. 1. Mark Ruffalo: Best Supporting actor 2. Best Original Background Score 3. Best Original Soundtrack from one of the above 4. Kiera Knightley: May be for the Best ActressYo & U......",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Pretty solid,"This is a pretty solid film all around. The performances are solid, the music is solid, the writing is solid. But none of its aspects are truly outstanding though, and when compared to the beautifully moving Once, it pales in comparison. Once was just more heartfelt, more realistic, and the music is in a league of its own. Still, it's not right to just compare it to Once, even if it is similar in superficial ways. This one blends in more elements into the story, including their personal problems and it also ventures into more mainstream-levels. I wouldn't say that this is a must-see by ay means, but it gets the job done. Recommended.",,Anonymous,Music
"Impressive, inspiring, such a impression","I strongly recommend. I never wrote review before but after watching ""Begin Again"" I had to do it and it tells how I'm impressed by the film. Every single song in the movie is like a ""food"" for ears, for sure will be listening to them every day. This is the type of film with soul that you won't find nowadays. I heard about it when it got out but I thought it wasn't that good and didn't want to watch but the day before I heard the soundtrack and I was amazed, especially ""Lost Stars"".

Just go with the flow and let life inspires you to create,"Begin Again is refreshing, sincere and realistic. I think in certain ways it is even better than Once. Original, authentic and spontaneous. It just flows so naturally and captivating that you are just sucked in and want to experience life with the cast.Mark Ruffalo is great. He is very good at portraying an overworked underdog. Here he plays the role of Dan, an award-winning record producer going downhill in his career because of his personal problems triggered by his divorce. His ex-wife Miriam (Catherine Keener) is also in the music business. As for Keira Knightley, it is probably her best – natural and not too pretentious as her previous work. Still, she could have toned down a little more in some scenes. In this movie she is Gretta, an amateur sing-song writer comes to New York from England with her boyfriend who signs with a big record company. But as fame and the music industry consume him, she painfully realizes their fundamental differences.The best part of the film is the theme/story: how people create music to express emotions and share, not necessarily for fame or money, which easily get in the way of pure artistic creation. On another dimension, it also traces the production and distribution channel of the music business which has evolved into mass participation and authenticity (backup singing or street kids, guitar from the daughter and ambiance) with the popularization of digital technology and the internet. Then we, as audience, also have the same access to creation and sharing. It is also a big slash to marketing and packaging which tend to focus on the looks and images and ignoring the core of the music – the emotions it represents. Of course the third layer is how music bring seemingly love/marriages/relationship together and/or tear them apart.The movie opens with two heart-broken, frustrated and lonely people's encounter through original music. Greta's first song touches on being alone in a city which exactly show how both of them feel at the time. The way she presents herself reflects the rawness but authenticity of her work. So is her advice to Violet (Hailee Steinfeld), Dan's teenage daughter on how to dress to express herself as a real and confident person.The use of imagination and free flow of ideas flows fluently throughout, I especially like the first scene of the imaginary band and production to go with Greta's song.The movie is inspiring in the sense that everyone one of us can be an artist and create, as long as we do it from the heart. And do not worry about making money, because it will come along the way as long as we do a good job.Lots of sincerity and definitely a wakeup call to push us to focus on what is really important in creation and expression, as well as in chasing our dreams and in interacting with our loved ones. Rich and real in music, emotion, relationship, creativity, confidence and go with the flow. Just sit back and enjoy it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Rich, Full, and Complete Film","I'll cut to the piece. I don't like mellow film. I like it when explosives blind my eyes, and fancy action captivates me. Yet for some reason, when I sat in the theater to screen this film, I could not help but send chill after chill down my spine.It's not one of those films that awkwardly fuse performance and film (in the way that the storyline is insignificant over the performance - namely the StepUp series). Every song, every lyric, every melody blends in naturally with the flow of the story, and the emotions of the characters are so detailed. The acting is perfect, but so is the atmosphere in each scene.I can't say that I have one favorite movie, but if I had to choose, it would definitely be this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Pleasant Surprise,"Whether or not you're a big music fan, I think Begin Again will be an enjoyable watch. It's actually not what I thought it would be. I expected more of a sappy romantic comedy with a whole bunch of music plugs for famous artists. Sure, there are a few of those, but it never takes away from the film in general. Plus Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo have great chemistry together.Ruffalo plays a washed up alcoholic record label manager. He has had his fair share of family issues and career obstacles but he has enough friends to keep him around a little longer. Knightley plays a woman grieving over her the recent break up with her boyfriend (Levine) and just hopes people hear her songs the way she hears them. The chance encounter between the two at the bar sparks an unlikely friendship and many cool songs. They decide to start a band that records their songs independently and outside in New York City. It's a pretty cool idea to have all the ambient sound in the background which gives you a true city life experience. Apparently it is Knightley singing in all these songs which is good to hear, though most have been edited in the studio. I think it would have been even better if they filmed and recorded these songs ACTUALLY outside during production of the movie. It would have given it such a natural feel to it.The film goes back and forth between Gretta's rebuilding of her life since her break up, and Dan's trouble reconnecting with his daughter and ex-wife. I liked this approach, but I do think it would have benefited more if it focused on the band and the relationship between Dan and Gretta. I didn't find the Adam Levine story to be interesting at all, in fact I think it was a pretty poor effort. But when you break the film down and realize it does what it set out to do, which is telling a story about two people who need new beginnings in their lives. It's a sweet and harmless tale that most people can enjoy.+Fascinating idea+Chemistry between our leads+Feel good film+Catchy songs-Could have actually recorded outside-Levine's storyline7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
... somewhat a musical in disguise,"Haven't counted the total number songs in this film, but once you get into it a bit, it seems as if one is almost always playing. Not that it's a bad thing, for in fact, the music is one of the better parts of the movie. The story's consistently straight-forward not leaving much to get deeply involved with, and the acting follows along and pretty much gets the job done without problems (these are after all some well know names, with lots of productions to their credit). Have always liked the leads, and here they work the script as best they can. It's overall a decent way to spend an hour and forty-five minutes.. and in addition listen to some fairly decent tunes.. (some being much better than others).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"innovative, insightful, visionary, perceptive","Dumped, broke, fired, punched, dreams crushed, drunk, estranged from loved ones, no place to stay, cheated on, alienated and/or alone, the main characters of this film, Greta and Dan, are both extremely down on their luck. Yet these two who wear their hearts on their sleeves and bring life to those around them, in their own unusual ways, encounter each other by chance. They begin to work their odd magic on each other. From the innovative, insightful, visionary, perceptive and independent director of ""Once,"" a film I enjoyed immensely, I was again – much as I tried to resist high expectations - transported to a romantic, musical, surreal realm. The alluring pulse of the music, beautiful scenes from the streets of New York, the unexpected twists and turns of the story, the evident chemistry between Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo, interesting dialogue, and naturalistic shots that provided the feeling that I was a part of the film rather than merely watching it, delighted and charmed me to no end. This film is more than a musical, emotions are communicated through songs that come from the hearts of the characters. Keira and Mark are astounding. Keira breaks up with her boyfriend in a look, and pulls it off. A film for the humble and supportive people who, when they fall down, have others who take the opportunity to pile more troubles upon them.

Full of music,"The making of the movie is interesting. The way everything flows has a bit of niceness to it. The songs are good too. One surprising thing is that Keira Knightley's singing is not bad at all. Although the same thing can't be said about the acting of Adam Levine. I think that's the only downside of this movie. It seemed rigid almost all of the time except when he was singing(i guess that's not a big surprise).Most of the music lovers would enjoy this. I must mention one thing too...the story has a huge amount of similarity with the movie 'Once'. So viewers who have seen that movie wouldn't find this idea new.To summarize....its a good movie with decent music in it, definitely very enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Surprisingly lovely,"I was a bit shocked that I liked this movie as much as I did, if I'm honest. I adore Mark Ruffalo in anything, but am not particularly enamored of Keira Knightley, as her performance often comes off as a little 'brattish' and unsympathetic to me. Also, the idea of her as a singer kind of rankled for me, as I felt as if the role could have been given to someone with genuine a musical background rather than an A list star who just happens to be able to sing.That said, I was bracing myself for hating the 'music' part of the movie, so was pleasantly surprised to discover all of Gretta's songs were wonderfully written, quirky and delicate rather than poppy over-produced crap that would have been incidental to the plot. I adored the idea of music recorded with a background of city sounds, and loved seeing how the 'band' formed so organically and the individual characters of the musicians. That part felt very real for me, and was massively entertaining to watch.Ruffalo's enthusiastic, weathered Dan was a warm, sweet-hearted lead, who just unfolded like a flower as the movie went on; starting out as a slightly unsympathetic stubborn jerk and ending as a man who'd discovered the joy of life. I loved that the moments of tenderness between him and Gretta never moved into romance, but instead realistically portrayed the very special connection made with someone who helps you grow and change. My heart ached during the scenes when they walked the city at night - sharing Gretta's playlist - because to meet someone like that and share such a special evening is a moment that sometimes only happens once in a lifetime.Such a touching, joyful film and one most musicians I know would love.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Sentimental Comedy Overwhelmed with Unmemorable Tunes,"Sometimes you just know when a film isn't for you. This is not the same experience as watching a ""bad"" film, with deficiencies of script, characterization and directorial technique. The issue centers over questions of taste: what viewers expect from a film and what they are actually presented with.This is certainly the case with John Carney's BEGIN AGAIN. The plot is straightforward: Brit expat Gretta (Keira Knightley) has a long- term relationship with Dave (Adam Levime) which crashes on the rocks when Dave is catapulted to stardom and has a brief fling with publicist Mim (Jennifer Li). Gretta meets accidentally with washed- up producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) in a New York bar, and after an iffy start, the two of them agree to produce a do-it-yourself album of Gretta's songs, with the help of amateur musicians, Dan's daughter Violet (Hailee Stanfield), and some of Dan's acquaintances in the music business. The plot is an old one, a recycling of the ""Let's Put on a Show"" genre historically associated with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland musicals of the Thirties.The leading actors try their best with a shallowly-written script, but nonetheless Ruffalo's Dan comes across as someone entirely responsible for his own decline due to impatience and a fondness for alcohol. Knightley's Gretta is a passive figure, although apparently a talented song-writer, and she really cannot sing.Yet the potential for character-development is set aside in a film with far too many unmemorable musical numbers for its own good. On several occasions viewers yearn for the singing to end and the plot to resume.There remain one or two incidental pleasures: Carney's use of New York locations communicates something of the city's infinite riches, although we could have done without the clichéd sequence in Times Square. James Corden rehearses his familiar role of a bouncy best friend (in his pre-LATE LATE SHOW incarnation).",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Musically divine,"John Carney the director who bought us the beautiful musical ""Once"" back in 2006 has offered a true piece of romantic movie again that touches the senses. And it's filled with breathtakingly mesmerizing music one after the other and the charmingly graceful performances by Keira Knightley and Mark Rufalo. And when all of those combined with a lovely storyline that sinks right in to fans heart how can a movie like this ever go wrong. And by far this is one of the best musical filled comedy dramas I can recall.When Dan (Mark) a talented yet beaten up by life music agent desperately looking for new talent to get his life a jump start, accidentally meets Gretta (Keira) a beautiful girl with a voice he was looking for. But convincing her to sign up to do an album was challenging enough for Dan as Gretta is about to leave town with a broken heart.No doubt that pinnacle of Begin Again is its music. Five minutes down the movie it throws out a wonderful track that instantly grabs the viewer. And this moment becomes the central point of Dan meeting Gretta where it is visited couple of times via different story lines making its presence stronger. Starting from this song and the opening sequence the movie quickly yet steadily evolves in to something serenely beautiful and so does its music. The two key roles has their own independent story lines running alongside which fuels the main plot and the director has managed to beautifully blend everything together.However Begin Again is bit far from reality though it covers its faults with a dramatic cloak and its charming performances and music. But to enjoy this movie the absolute reality factor is not something that's really required. And honestly compared with often seeing cheesy romantic dramas that pops up like mushrooms these days Begin Again is a modern wonder.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Leaves you smiling,"When considering the elements that make up Begin Again, it's apparent that this could have been a disaster. A heartwarming tale featuring Keira Knightley as an under-appreciated singer-songwriter, plucked from obscurity by a washed-up music executive who hears something special when he accidentally catches her only live performance in a New York bar? Keira Knightley singing? James Corden as Keira Knightley's acoustic-guitar-strumming best buddy? The guy from Maroon 5?Well it is quite heartwarming actually, and it largely works. Much of this can be put down to Mark Ruffalo's relentless likability even when playing flawed characters. Reminiscent of his recent performance in 'Thanks for Sharing', his character's renewed enthusiasm for music is genuinely infectious and therefore believably so in the context of the film. Knightley's singing is fine, though it hardly stops you in your tracks, while the songs are generally good enough to feasibly convince as minor, middle-of-the-road hits. There are various subtexts regarding the music industry and its relationship with artists, among other things, but these always feel secondary to the life-affirming central story of a pair of people helping each other to pursue what makes them happy.Begin Again leaves you smiling, and that's the measure of success for this type of film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

However, the story is not bad, good. But not excellent. Why I say this is that I barely the detailed points of the movie; what is the character's name, what happens between the two main character etc...

"Not exactly boy meets girl, but sort of like that","Begin Again (2013/II) was written and directed by John Carney, It's a movie with a fairly basic plot--struggling, formerly great music producer (Dan, played by Mark Ruffalo), meets young, inexperienced singer-songwriter (Gretta, played by Keira Knightley) and the magic begins.What makes this more than just another summer movie is the great acting--from the two leads, and also from Hailee Steinfeld as Violet, Dan's daughter, and Catherine Keener as Miriam, Dan's estranged wife.Also, I've never understood what a record's producer brought to the team. Here, it was clear to me that Dan could listen to a young singer playing her guitar, and hear in his head what she would sound like with full musical accompaniment. That's a talent that he had, and others didn't.Another highlight for me was the concept of avoiding the cost of a studio by recording an album outdoors in various locations across New York City. It's one of those ideas where you say, ""It's so crazy, it just might work.""We saw this film on the large screen at the Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It probably will work better on a large screen than on DVD. However, it's worth seeing, so if it's not playing locally, watch it any way you can.

Feel-good music biz movie,"Writer-director John Carney's Begin Again (trailer) is a music business movie that pushes the questionable idea that Talent Will Out—in this case the talent-spotting talent of Mark Ruffalo as an out-of-luck music producer and the singer-songwriter talent of, unexpectedly, Keira Knightley. Knightley is less believable than the scruffy Ruffalo, but this is her least self-conscious performance I've seen. The music-making partnership between them could easily devolve into cliché, but I'm glad to say it escapes that trap, as they set up shop in various outdoor Manhattan locations to record the tracks of her possible breakout album. Meanwhile, he defends her potential to his former recording-company partner, enjoyably played by Mos Def. Both lead characters are separated from their significant others—Knightley from her success-obsessed boyfriend, played by real-life music star Adam Levine, and Ruffalo from his wife, played by Catherine Keener in too small a role.

A movie for musicians without too much unneeded emotional substance,"Rolling Stone continues to praise pretty much any movie out there that revolves around the music industry (most likely due to its slow departure into oblivion). This particular movie gets it right in a lot of ways though. The perspective of the musicians is true to life and the written music was nominated for an Oscar: it's some of the best songs written for a movie since Almost Famous. The recording scenes are inspiring and the musical energy is palpable to the audience.As far as the rest of the movie goes, it's has warmth and truth in the relationships with great performances--suffering mostly from an inexperienced, yet decent, screenplay writer: it is obvious that this movie was written by a musician and not a novelist.This movie is great If you're looking for a romantic comedy that's easy to watch and isn't over sexualized to make up for the lack of drama.

"A truly worthy love letter to New York, Romance, Music, and Second Chances.","This film, to look from a distance, seems like your usual dime a dozen ROM-COM. All the tropes seem to be in place, just waiting to be ordinary, forgettable experience. Just like all the pop songs that use the same chord progression as ""Pachelbel's Canon in D"". Though, just like some of those songs, a little personality will turn it from generic, to the song you hum in the shower.The film introduces you to its leads in a very interesting way. Which hooked me right away. You are then given context to the night of their serendipitous meeting. Seeing the events that placed both of them in the same venue at just the right moment as to have, what could be, a life changing moment for them both.It is filled to the brim with music. Most of which is very enjoyable, if not a little more Pop than my personal taste. Which is fine, there isn't a sour note in the whole film.All of the actors are used to great effect. Which is impressive with the number of real greats it contains. Keira Knightly is instantly likable here. Her character always seems to have the right intentions if not the best execution. Mark Ruffalo, like always, shines as the washed up music producer/record label executive. Waiting to regain his life after a series of failures. Adam Levine, well, seems to play a different version of himself, only much less likable at times. Kathrine Keener, isn't in the movie enough. I think most people will agree. I like her a lot and she is always fun to watch. She does what she does better than anyone else, in my humble opinion.Each story is granted the time it deserves, without staying overly long with any single person. You really get to understand and relate to all the character motivations in the time given. Even when there are deviations from the usual or expected, with some of the relationships. You know exactly why those things happen and understand the reasons, behind those decisions.All in all, I really enjoyed this film. I have seen many a film that fails at what this story attempts. Yet it really does nail it. It is about dealing with the unexpected derailment that life seems to drop on you. Giving examples of how to pick up the pieces and get back on track. It's a good thing then, that the first song we hear is about finding yourself in the subway without direction.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

However, Begin Again is a carefully composed musical drama, with infectious earworms and emotional moments spread throughout the movie accordingly.

can dan and gretta help each other?,"I had already seen carney's ""sing street"", which was good! He seems to like writing about the music industry, and how people get into the biz. Dan (ruffalo) is the head of a record company, but doesn't like where things are headed. Or maybe he's just run out of ideas. So they ""let him go"". At a chance meeting with gretta, a musician in a small club, dan really likes her sound and her style, and wants to work with her. All very ground up, since his old studio doesn't want anything to do with it. A couple references to ""a star is born"", which had already been remade several times. How many compromises will dan and gretta have to make? Or will they be willing to make? Gretta is stubborn, and her principles are more important to her than making money.

A waste of good music and a good cast,"Having enjoyed John Carney's previous film to this 'Once' I was intrigued to see how he was going to top it.The resulting film sees him trying to replicate the idea of a lost guy being saved by a woman and some music, but moving the action to the US.And sadly much of the charm gets lost in translation, with the almost home made quality of 'Once' being left behind.Levine and Knightley form an unlikely double act and are well supported by Ruffalo, but although the music is good, the story is flimsy and too reliant on swearing to be entertaining.I've read lots of reviews of this film that call it 'charming' and a 'must see'. Sadly I can agree with neither. The only good thing is that Carney more than made up for this mess with his next film 'Sing Street'.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
An uplifting music based treat,"(88%) A real nice surprise, as I was originally in two minds to even go and watch this, but I'm very glad that I did as this is very likely to be the most uplifting film of the year, and if not, then it's certainly at the very least one of them. It's such a sweet-natured, charming watch that's structured as well as the songs performed. And if ever a movie that's worth a cinema ticket price for the sound quality alone, then it's this one, as the crappy speakers on a modern flat screen TV aren't gonna cut it. Mark Ruffalo is hands down perfect in this, he couldn't be any better, and Keira Knightly really does a fantastic job in expanding her range, and not only through her fine acting performance, but in actually being a pretty decent singer/performer too. I loved the location work with so much of it shot on real New York streets, as the surroundings worked their way into the film perfectly. As far as modern-day romantic comedy dramas go that push through pure genuine happiness without the need to use cheap Hollywood gimmicks, or any over-use of syrup; that's both funny and realistically dramatic, this really is a wonderful, music-filled and joyful treat of a film that's a perfect tonic when you're feeling down. A pick of the year for me without a doubt.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
John Carney knows his job,"This is my favorite movie, the most inspiring movie ever. I like the spontaneous acting, looking so realistic. I love how Dan watches Violet, i like how friendship between Gretta and Steve is shown, love that scene when Gretta react when Den says ''she is English girl''.I love how Dan deals with his life's problems.. Den is a key character in the movie, so lovable person. A songs in this movie was amazing, one of the best movie soundtracks ever. Every actor in this movie is well-chosen, there is no space for mistakes.

Good but WAY too long,"Believe me: I LIKED this movie. BUT! -- it was just FAR too long. This movie was 1 hour and 44 minutes; they could've EASILY cut it down to 1 hour and ten minutes and without losing any plot points.Watching this movie was like watching a soundtrack of a movie. The music was good but......could something happen now?! -- PLEASE?!? (...in the words of Judge Smails in Caddyshack..) ""...well?...we're WAITing!.....""The end also left me unsatisfied. I won't include any spoilers so I won't go into detail, but I felt like the end was a bummer.Overall, enjoyed it. But again: too long.

That music though!,"-Begin Again, which actually came out earlier in the year, is about a music producer who's job and marriage are ruined, when he finds a talented musician, who doesn't want to make music, who's relationship is also ruined. They become friends, make music, and learn how to work hard to fix their relationships and, well, begin again.-So as this type of film goes, I would directly compare it to Chef. It's redemptive themes are great and inspiring! I really enjoyed it! -The story is very good. It was very original, to me at least, and I enjoyed that they didn't end up together like cliché would ordinarily dictate. It also gives an insight as to how the music industry can carry an emotional burden with it.-The acting was very good! Keira Knightley is GREAT!! Mark Ruffalo does a good job, but he has a few moments where he overacts. The girl from True Grit is in it and she does a great job too! (Maybe better than Mark)-It has a pretty realistic and uplifting tone to it, and it is well paced.-There is not a lot else I really have to talk about, so I guess I will mention the best thing about it, which is the music. I loved the music. Keira Knightley is actually a really great singer and the original songs in it are just wonderful! Lost Stars, the film's theme, might just win an Oscar.-Content: It is rated-R for some moderate, but realistic language.-So, Begin Again is a very down-to-earth film with a positive message and great music! I did really like it and I will say it is totally worth checking out! Because of the music, a great ending, and the themes that work soo well with the song, I would actually give it a high 7.5. Even if you don't watch the film, listen to Lost Stars!!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Found what I was looking for..,"This movie is such a breath of fresh air after so long. Ever since watching the legendary Almost Famous, I have been on the lookout for similar movie. Although I would never say this movie will even come close to accomplishing what Almost Famous did, nor is it along the same lines, but for me its a celebration of good music. It echoes some of my thoughts on what has happened to the music industry today and on some level, struck a cord with me, hence the high rating.I think the casting is perfect, I don't think Scarlett Jo would have been able to pull off the heartbroken song writer look because lets face it, who would leave her?! The music is definitely refreshing but what really got me hooked was that first 10-15 minute sequence when the first song is shown from Ruffalo's perspective and he adds some background instruments with his mind and somehow the song becomes 15 times more awesome!Its definitely a feel good movie and will leave you with a pleasant taste in your mouth no matter what kind of movies you like. But I have a feeling this will be only highly appreciated by only certain kinds of people, but i personally hope it becomes a permanent member on the list of movies about good music.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Just form a band to Begin Again,"I have to lead with Keira Knightley sings really well!! She played an angel of a character and made the hard decisions many significant others have to make. Mark Ruffalo gets into the music too and he likes to call women Babe, a lotalo. I like the way he put the pieces of the song together by adding one instrument at a time. That was pretty neat! Supporting cast carried their weight really well. Thank you British guy for the lighter moments.Every movie seems to have a lesson or two. I learned music is cool, especially when walking around New York. Recording labels are not really needed any more. And, CeeLo makes an exceptional rhyme all the time.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I was very surprised how much I enjoyed this movie.,"I had heard about some parts of the plot, so I was expecting this film to a lot sadder than it turned out to be. Ruffalo and Knightley portrayed a music producer and folky songwriter who pleasantly were never romantically involved, but built a wonderful friendship instead. These two actors displayed this story very well, along with a few celebrities that I didn't expect, such as Adam Levine, James Corden, and upcoming actress Hailee Steinfeld. The director, John Carney, made a good use of many different angles and transitions in the film. There was a variety of uses for the cut transition, but most of them had the effect of making you feel like the scene was real. It cut forward in time, yet in the same scene, and that allows the audience to feel like the scene hasn't truly been cut. The transitions weren't the only thing that made this film feel real. The actors portrayed their emotions and the situations in a way that made it not seem planned out or scripted. This was what I loved about this movie most; that I hardly felt like I was watching a movie, but that I was living the journey with these unique characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Clichés avoided,"I am a big fan of movies in which the writer and/or director do not make the easy/clichéd choice. I can now add Begin Again to that club.The plot is simple even if little optimistic. Gretta (Keira Knightley) moves to NYC with her long-time boyfriend (and song-writing partner) when the boyfriend is signed to a big label. Of course, the romance does not survive the newly-found fame (ok, that was a clichéd choice but I can live with that). Gretta now has to find her own way, without her partner (romantic and song-writing). Her discovery by a down-and-out music label exec (Mark Ruffalo) (ok, another cliché) allows her to grow and to get her own chance to sign to a record label. But Gretta makes the unexpected choices regarding romance, recording, and her future (hence the membership to the non-cliché club). OK, you can see some of these choices coming but may not actually expect the characters to go through with them. Kudos also for not allowing the close-knit relationship between the two leads to develop into romance. Platonic relationships do exist and the film recognizes that.Good dialog, good use of NYC for making ambient song recordings, and good acting all- around (including a credible job by Adam Levine of Maroon 5 as the jilting boyfriend). A special treat also for fans of the world of struggling musicians.This makes me want to add director John Carney's prior work, Once, to my queue of movies to be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
WOW,Beautiful film from all points of view that tells in a beautiful and full of emotions the life of a record company that is turned upside down by his latest and youngest musical discovery: a girl with boundless talent and light-heartedness. The film entertains a lot even without anything extraordinary happening and manages to make the viewer become attached to both the singer and the discographer enormously. The film manages to describe in a beautiful and exhaustive way the encounter between a very talented but never considered singer and a person who has now given up and takes refuge only in alcohol and manages well to tell how these two people improve each other.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Will Make You Fall In Love With Music All Over Again,"Dan: That's some song you got there. I promise you it could be a big hit. Plus you're beautiful.Gretta: I'm sorry, what's beauty got to do with anything?This is the first exchange between Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley's characters in this story about flawed lives intertwining with a backdrop of music. This film centers around Gretta (Knightley) a young singer-songwriter who is new to Manhattan and Dan (Ruffalo) a music-business executive who both meet each other at pivotal moments in their life. Gretta who recently broke up with her rising star boyfriend Dave Kohl (Adam Levine) and Dan who had recently split from his partner lean on each other. With a little bit of help from her friend Steve (James Corden), who steals certain scenes with his witty humour. (Side note: James Corden will be making his mark on Late Night by replacing Craig Ferguson on The Late Late Show soon).Begin Again questions the music industry as a whole, while showing you someone who is a sellout and one who is in it for the love of music. There came a point when it was no longer about the art form, but about the money that could be made. The industry will check you up and spit you back out again given the chance at an extra buck. Dan and Gretta butt heads on this topic many times throughout the film. Dan wants to make Gretta into a hit maker while she just does it for her own pleasure.This film will make you fall in love with music all over again. The film may be about life and relationships, but this feels like a love letter to music from writer/director John Carney. Songs written specifically for the film show the depth of music and is used as a way to communicate and express one self. Knightley's soothing voice backed by a great melody will make you want to hear it over and over again.If this film doesn't get a nomination for original song it should receive acting nods for Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo. Ruffalo's performance as a alcoholic finding his way to become a good Father is mesmerizing, while Knightley's performance is one of her best. Two actors who you would never think would go together, have an onscreen chemistry casting agents only dream of.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Melancholy With Music,"This is Mark Ruffalo's movie. He is always good but in this film he's great. Keira Knightley is very good in her role, but it plain and simple is Ruffalo's picture. There's some good music in this one, both old and new. Knightley has an adequate voice but not a strong, pure sound by any means. Sufficient for this film and the songs she sings. But make no mistake, she won't become a super star recording artist, let's put it that way. Watching and listening to the creation of music, and viewing the possibilities come to life in Mark Ruffalo's character's mind is fascinating. Adam Levine's voice it entirely too high pitched for my taste but for fans, I suspect he's fine for them. All in all, it's a pretty good, musical movie. And refreshing to see something that's not just another trashy, vulgar movie, the type of which we seem to have way, way too many lately.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Make sure you like indie music,"I'll forever be in love with Keira Knightley, and she has great versatility. When you see her in a period piece, it's as if she were an old portrait come to life. When she acts in a modern movie, it's inconceivable she could ever fit into a historical setting. In Begin Again, she's a struggling indie singer who gets discovered by Mark Ruffalo (also incredibly versatile), a music producer with an exceptional imagination. My favorite scene is when Mark first sees her perform in a nightclub. She's singing along with her guitar, and as he listens, he imagines the potential of her song. One by one, different instruments are added, and as a rhythm section, harmonies, and counterpoint are combined, the audience hears what he's creating in his head. The look on his face is incredible. And who knows; it might have been the twentieth take!Begin Again is a movie about the indie music scene. If you like opera (or even regular songs that require a good voice), you won't like it. Mark comes up with the idea of making New York City a part of the soundtrack to Keira's songs. They run around the city and record in different areas, picking up street sounds, ancillary people, and even the subway. You can't do that! Your songs will sound horrible! But, in Hollywood-land, it's supposed to be cool and ground-breaking. With a jackhammer in the background, it will be ground-breaking. Anyway, it's a harmless movie that is entertaining the first time you watch it. Just make sure you're alright with indie and modern pop music. Adam Levine, James Corden, and CeeLo Green are in the supporting cast. My mom's an opera singer, and she was cringing through this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Feel good movie of the year,"Very pleasant film starring Keira Knightley as Gretta, a Briton leaving in New York. She has just separated from her rock star boyfriend and writing partner Dave (Adam Levine), and is about to return to London, when she is asked to perform impromptu by his friend Steve (James Corden) in a club. Down and out producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) happens to be there at the time, and is entranced by her performance and tries to sign her for a record label headed by his ex partner Saul (nicely played by rap artist Mos Def). She is initially reluctant but finally goes along.Though marketed as a romantic comedy, it hardly follows the ""boy meets girl"" formula. Knightley sings many songs in the movie, not all memorable (I did like ""A step you can't take back"" which is included in the movie's best scene, as Dan imagines Gretta's acoustic performance accompanied by a full rock orchestra). Knightley usual charm is the major driver of this feel-good movie, though most performances are fine. Also with Catherine Keener and Hailee Stanfield, as Dan's ex wife and daughter. There is a great scene after the final credits you should wait for.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Music makes all of it magical. It's basically like love. Makes everything around us much brighter and more beautiful. I recommend this movie to every music lover out there. To every listener. To every passenger of this life who hasn't yet found either love or the joy of being part of the music. To every soul that hasn't got the chance to sing yet.

Lovely sound tracks. Gifted me an impetus to live on through the challenges in life. I thank 'Begin Again'.,"It's really about music, and how our lives are influenced by the music that we love. You know what kind of person he or she is when you listen to their playlists.I personally listened to all the soundtracks from the movie before I watched the movie at the theatre. If movie soundtracks are one of the key criterion that you are conscious with when judging the quality of a movie just like myself, I would definitely encourage you to do the same. 'Begin Again' has one of the best soundtracks that I have ever encountered. Every song has its message, and a story. (I'm not saying every one of them were my taste though)Here is a brief summary of the message that I got from the movie: Take on the punches you must take, and move on to the next moments of your life. You never know whats ahead of those brutal punches.The sensation after the movie was enormous. Harmony of those warm hearted messages and simply amazing sound tracks was more than enough to make my day. I do go harsh on movie reviews and I do admit being a strong critic, but this movie is worth the compliments.I thank 'Begin Again', for endowing me courage to take on the challenges, as well as momentum to proceed on to next 'steps that I can't take back'.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Like a good song you can't wait to hear again!,"'BEGIN AGAIN': Four Stars (Out of Five)Musical romantic comedy flick written and directed by John Carney; who also wrote and directed the critically acclaimed 2007 Irish musical 'ONCE'. Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley star in the movie (Knightley also did all of her own singing) as an alcoholic music executive and a singer/songwriter who collaborate on a music album; they record all live over the summer (in New York City). It costars Hailee Steinfeld, Catherine Keener, James Corden, CeeLo Green, Mos Def and Adam Levine (in his film debut). I found the movie to be really entertaining and emotionally uplifting as well.Ruffalo plays Dan Mulligan, a recently unemployed music label executive who lives in New York City. Dan is separated from his wife, Miriam (Keener), and hasn't signed a successful music artist in seven years. He also has a teenage daughter, named Violet (Steinfelf), and is an alcoholic, due to his depression. Knightley plays Gretta, a singer/songwriter who recently broke up with her longtime boyfriend, Dave (Levine). The two moved to New York because Dave was signed to a record label. He quickly let the success go to his head though and had an affair with a music label associate. Dan discovers Gretta playing one of her songs at a bar, in East Village, and immediately thinks she's the person who will help him get out of the rut he's in. The two soon decide to produce an album together.I like 'ONCE', a lot, because I really like the music and think the movie was filmed beautifully. I like this film for the same reasons; the music is great and the film looks amazing. It's also just a cool feel-good movie. I really enjoyed it, a lot, while I was watching it. Like 'ONCE', it's not a film I'll take a lot away from but it's still a really fun time at the movies. It's also one I look forward to seeing again, like a good song that you can't wait to hear again!

Watching it reinforced the theme that letting go and saying no are equally important in a relationship.Foremost, the music and lyrics are so mesmerizing that I couldn't help but listen to the soundtracks right after. The two versions of Lost Stars by Keira and Adam evoke the feelings of different stages of a relationship. Strongly recommend listening to them back to back.It's tempting to reconnect with someone who was once in your life, especially when they become a promising star. Gretta couldn't resist to find Dave at his performance, but she learned her self-worth and she wouldn't allow a person who hurts her profoundly to walk back in her life. She also understands what truly makes Dan happy and sometimes, love is about supporting someone's happiness, even when it means letting them go.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Flop 50 (rental),"I pick this one for Keira and it was a good opportunity to test my theory that actual American movies are totally disconnected with their audience (explaining that they are so bad!)In short, the American movies offer today a restricted choice of characters: either Law, either Criminals, Either Vigilante, Either prestigious elite (doctors, lawyers, and entertainment). So this one belongs to the last category being a meeting about a new artist and an old famous producer, and it's not even a biopic! So who's really care about that? How many relatives of friends have you got with an album career? Zero, like me, so really I can't enter this movie and I'm already bored since the beginning!After, we have the complete track: the writing session, the session, the recording, the video, the live performance, all this with the same really poor songs and it's just excruciating!If that was not enough, the movie adds the usual rebel teen because the parents split (see JP3 for example) and as expected, it's poor drama, fake feelings and lost timeAt last, the movie shows clearly how America evolves for the worst: teen dress like prostitutes, parents look like bums, young wear beards and don't want to work much and homes are slums!!

A Different Kind of Feel-Good Movie,"If you're in to see this movie with hopes of getting a deep story of how things will progress, then you're clearly watching it for the wrong reason. From the trailers itself, it was obvious that the film will have a simple plot, yet holds a promise for a successful soundtrack. The real challenge for the filmmakers was to make this simple plot an enjoyable one, and they pretty much nailed it. The technique they used to show how the characters' paths meet, from their individual stories, is underrated. And while it teased our romantic hearts into thinking there's a love story to be expected somewhere along the way, I commend the fact that the writers didn't give in to the demands of romanticism which could have possibly categorized this as a romance film, when it clearly isn't supposed to be. Another underrated fact about this film is that it shed some light on how the music industry transforms different artists. When applied in the real world setting, this film speaks volumes of whom artists let themselves become when fame hits them.The music in this film is what brought it to success. If you're gonna judge it based on the story, then look into the background stories that inspired each song to their fruition. Watch this and see that the songs you'll find here are magic, and are sure to linger in your heart.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Music will connect people,"In the beginning, I expected it would be a typical success story of a singer-songwriter, who seemingly had trouble in the past and tries to ""begin again."" But as she is encouraged to come to the stage and starts singing with her guitar, I thought ""It's not for me..."" Maybe the voice of Gretta, starring Keira Knightley is great, and lyrics are touching; however, the melody is a little bit plain. Audiences in the film feel the same way, and there is only sparse applause after the performance except for one guy - he puts a full smile on his face and stares Gretta on the stage.
Suddenly, the focus of the camera moves to the guy, Dan. He used to be a talented music producer but loses his fame, property, job, family bond and almost nothing left. When he listens to Gretta's song, however, without hope at the bar, the story truly begins. While Gretta's performance, Dan sees musical accompaniments such as a drum, piano, or violin in his mind; now her plane song turns into much more emotional, attracting, and even breathtaking music!
As the story goes on, we find both Gretta and Dan is connected by their experiences of being betrayed by an important person, but I think the most attractive part of this movie is how two of them encounter led by music. The storyline is little bit typical, but I really like how various music in the film become the bridge for people with feeling of lost.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

for music lovers,"Begin Again is a film by John Carney, the creator of the phenomenal Once (2006), which has again set foot on its familiar ground music.

As it happens, at the moment of total emotional distress Dan accidentally hear Greta sing and feels the energy. The main difference between Once and Begin Again the use of flashbacks, the most famous are certainly the two from the first third of the film that seeks to explain how this is to their ""fatal"" encounter occurred. Musical numbers are creatively designed to the streets and more remote areas of New York overlooking the example.

Just SPOT. ON. In every way possible,"Let's just get this straight: there are those of us who've are or have been extreme fans of live music, me myself since my early teens. And once you get back to your house, to your apartment, to your relationships and to your life as you know it, after being on the road in one way or the other... if you could wish for one thing to be intertwined to your everyday emotions, it would be the way you feel when you experience someone pouring his or her heart out in the form of music.There's no accurate way to fully explain the sensation of experiencing live music, as an expression of your emotions in any specific moment when it makes it all just seem real. When a building filled with unique characters find themselves connected to one another in a, by looking at it from a distance, rather cheesy and yet f*cking wonderful way. You just can't get it down in text, or rather, I can't.But you know what? This movie actually, and I'm still positively surprised and stunned while I'm writing this since it came rather unexpected, this movie has actually got IT! ""Begin Again"" manages to get the scenes that are about recording, and about sharing and experiencing live music, to feel utterly real in a sense that simply blows you away.Sure, there's a fair bit of cliché hiding out not far from the surface of this movie. And sure, I must admit, the scenes where you find the characters sitting by themselves could have been better. As a matter of fact, the lack of situations where the actors actually scrutinize themselves could be a little bit excruciating from time to time.But even so, I feel obliged to state this: ""Begin Again"" manages, even through some of it's shortcomings, to capture so much of the life that IS live music that it even works fairly well as a substitute for being out on the road. And that, my dear friends, would be enough for me to recommend this gem to anyone with a soft spot for live music.I dare you not to check this soundtrack out afterwards.

The movie opens to Gretta (Knightly) reluctantly performing a song she has composed on the insistence of her friend in a bar.Although the lyrics are beautiful the song fails to impress the crowd except for Mark, who appears electrified by the song. This scene is replayed again from Mark's perspective after a recap of his day which seems to have been one continuous downwards spiral till he stumbles upon Gretta singing in the bar.The Song is replayed this time with all the background music and acoustics as imagined by Mark and how the songs get instantly transformed must be seen to be believe...This scene will be again be replayed from Gretta's perspective after a recap of how she landed in this bar after with her breakup with her longtime boyfriend and music sensation.Lots of good performances, and songs follow, making this thoroughly enjoyable till the end..",8.0,Anonymous,Music
must see this musical funny trip with a bit of everything good,"this is great . mark ruffalo was good in avengers , particularly at the end after credits when iron man narrates him as if he is a shrink . in this movie , he talks crazy ideas like free music , open recording. his relationship with daughter changes when he gets involved with music he seeked. keira knightly looks exactly normal with a lovable face not by looks but once you see her experiences . music industry working for money and degrading (popularising) artist's idea. there are people who steal songs and are incurable . music heals human relationships . keira breaks up in an innovative way . the pace of movie is wonderful . all conversations are so natural . there are good guys who are supportive . a series of events which trigger a meeting between stagnant music producer and unambitious singer . there is lot to think . most of all , keira with her natural smile makes scene adorable .",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Unique, fun, and brilliant","The characters are the beauty of this film. I'm shocked I haven't seen or been recommended this movie earlier... absolutely brilliant cast and film. I am not one to listen to movie soundtracks following, however, this movie changed me. I cannot wait to play these songs. The music, which is an absolute 10, does not overpower this film as it is equally entertaining.I think my favorite part of the film is that they are very subtle with the relationships. For once, I did not have a wave of emotions pounding in my face with a new drama every second. This film is foundationally unique. A couple of broken musicians setting out against all odds to produce and entire album from scratch. Really enjoyed the bits of fun among the crew, emphasizes the appreciation for new and fun art. This movie stays within its boundaries and just like the music, does not get lost in production.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Review Begin Again,"Begin Again follows Greta (Keira Knightley), a young woman who travels to New York to pursue her dream of becoming a professional singer. But when her boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine) joins a contract with a major label, He abandoned her and headed towards a better future, Greta. Both in love and struggling with being a singer in a restaurant. But with her talent, the underdog producer Dan (Mark Ruffalo) becomes interested. When the two got to know each other, It also produces something more than working together. And it will change their lives forever.As for the story, the chapters of the characters are quite easy to understand, not much hidden, but most of them have quite a lot of tears, and combined with the romantic love between the heroine and the heroine's boyfriend, we understand the mood of the character. And more in Which made me think of another movie, A Star Is Born, but Begin Again is more comedy than A Star Is Born, which has a somewhat darker plot.As for the music for this movie, I think the soundtrack of this movie is really good. It makes me feel like we're really going with the characters, and there's also a song that Adam Levine sang again, I think it's awesome. A lot of the song Coming Up Roses - Keira Knightley in the movie reminds me of the beatles.When it comes to the location of the movie, I think the director of the movie has chosen the location that is very suitable for this story, giving the impression of a pop star chasing dreams in a very busy city.The camera angles in this story are very natural, making it feel like a musical movie or a documentation movie about musicians.I think the movie is suitable for people who like the genre of musicians looking for their dreams or the love of creating music, or people who like to listen to music and may like it. Because this movie is not a musical genre that is similar to the movie la la land, let's try to watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Groundhog Day: The Bad Musical,"Begin Again has a story telling problem. Instead of telling a linear story it jumps back in time without warning or explanation half a dozen times and you get to painfully rehear the same bad song that opened the movie over and over and over again. But unlike Groundhog Day it is neither entertaining, romantic or funny.I have no idea where the ""comedy"" is in this movie as I never laughed once. There is literally no romantic story in this film anywhere to be found. Keira Knightly and Mark Ruffalo have absolutely zero chemistry but don't get me started on the worst fake beard I have ever seen on Adam Levine.No movie featuring original music integral to the plot has ever done well because the ""original"" music is always bad and Begin Again continues that tradition. You would think the producers would hire seasoned professionals to write the songs but instead they opted for former members of the no hit, no wonder ""New Radicals"" short lived (2 years) late 90's band.You know the music in a film is bad when the ""sell-out"" version of a song Adam Levine performs are a soundtrack's highlight. Now to be fair Keira Knightly can surprisingly sing which is why I am adding two stars to my review but it is does not save the hipsterish droning soundtrack I frequently fast-forwarded through.As with so many Hollywood films this one is filled with an artist profession trope (musician) who of course has the tired discussion of ""selling-out"" and being true to the art blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Sometimes you have to accept the reality that people like Bob Dylan may have been good song writers but were horrible singers and the best versions of their songs were refined by better musicians and producers.Movies about music always inject the writer, director or producer's crappy playlist of songs they try to expose people to not understanding that most of these songs failed at the time they were released for the same reason they do now. They never want to accept that the majority of people think their taste in music is just bad (which it is).This film tries so hard to be hip, diverse and apologetic for liking some popular songs that it came off cringe inducing at times. Musical taste is subjective to each individual so unless you are going with well-known hit songs you are just going to lose 90% of your audience, which is why I believe they initially gave this a limited release and it wound up bombing at the box office coming in ranking a dismal 126th for 2014.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Keira Knightley is impossibly adorable,"Totally fun movie. Both leads were great, but Knightley was exceptional -- talented, friendly, clever, funny, and of course beautiful.Given the large age difference between Ruffalo and Knightley I wouldn't have expected such warm chemistry between them, but there was.The rest of the story follows about what you'd expect for a romcom, maybe a few small unexpected shifts.Totally worth a watch. You'll feel good afterwards.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
It works in quiet ways,"Mark Ruffalo is great as a down and out music producer, a believer in independent music and co-founder of his own label, but who loses his job because of his excessive drinking. He's divorced with a teenage daughter, and feels her (and his ex-wife's) disrespect for him grow as he sinks to rock bottom. The scene where he stumbles across Keira Knightly, an aspiring young singer-songwriter performing solo in a small bar, and in his mind adds the music which could accompany it, is very nice; she thinks she's bombed based on the tepid reaction from the audience in the bar, whereas he sees her talent and begins pursuing her. Her boyfriend is Adam Levine, who has already become a successful artist, though they fight when he steals one of her songs for his album. It's a scene played quite well by both of them.The movie has a nice soundtrack, including ""Coming Up Roses"" by Keira Knightly and ""Lost Stars"" by Adam Levine. Knightly is good as a singer and Levine and CeeLo Green (in a smaller role) are good as actors, and Hailee Steinfeld, Ruffalo's character's daughter, is a solid young talent. The movie has an authentic feel to it, with shots in New York City's subways and streets that I enjoyed. It moves towards an ending which is mostly predictable I suppose, but in a heartfelt way, and with a few digs at the music industry along the way. It's not a masterpiece or anything, but it works in quiet ways.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great Movie, Made well and Good Acting","Let me start by telling you that John Carney has done an amazing job of this movie. The little details all came together to make such a good production.All of the acting is this movie is really, really good. Especially Mark Ruffalo who plays a very interesting character. Even Adam Lavine of Maroon 5 plays his character very well. Which, to be honest I wasn't expecting. I would like to see him in some more movies and he is well suited to the part he plays in Begin Again.The soundtrack is great and has some all time classics in it. I won't say too much but, if they release a soundtrack to the movie I would recommend buying it.Overall I would recommend going to the cinema to see this film as it has a good story line, some great acting and it is thoroughly enjoyable.Please keep an eye out for my other reviews. I am going to watch Hurcules on Friday night so, I will be reviewing that over the weekend (Or Monday).",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Sing everywhere.,"Begin again. Sing everywhere. A magnificent musical drama from director John Carney in which the duo of Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo showed themselves perfectly. The film itself shows what kind of love for music there is and that sometimes because of this you even have to choose between your loved one and this music itself. Stunning views of New York from the subway to the roofs of buildings, a pleasant summer atmosphere and beautiful music - all this makes ""Begin Again"" an excellent movie for evening viewing. What else is worth adding is the main character's excellent taste in music. The End.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Feel good portrait of a debuting singer/songwriter. Terrific music score. Great acting by Keira Knightly and Marc Ruffalo.,"Makes me feel good watching AND listening to this movie, because the story is so uplifting AND the soundtrack is just terrific.The story is about Keira Knightly struggling as an unknown singer/songwriter, who didnt even realize she has got talent, untill a famous (has been) producer (Mark Ruffalo) discovers her extra oridinary singer/songwriter skills. This story is what every young artist dreams of. In between a heart gets broken and mended again, so there is a bit of budding romance as well. Yes, this story might sound a bit corny, but it is portrayed in such a gentle, endearing and uplifting way, that your heart must be of stone when you wont get moved by it. A crowd pleaser, of the best kind...The end credits mention special thanks to Bono and everyone at the factory in Dublin, which is the home base for most of the U2 recordings.Although neither Bono nor U2 does appear in this movie. The son of Marc Ruffalo, called Keen, does appear in a small cameo role as one of the 4 streetkids who are asking for 5 dollars and a cigarette in return for their silence during a recording in an alley where they were playing.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
.shyt.,"Number 1- the synopsis of this movie is a lie, right off the bat. Keira Knightly is far far far from ""a young"" songwriter. So my initial thought was an actual laugh out loud/LOL... Number 2- I hate having to use so many backslashes and point forms in a review. Number 3- complete shyt! .point.blank.period. Ruffalo is clearly taking ANY roles he is offered. I don't understand how these types of movies, in which there have been a stupid amount of the past few years. Somehow they keep being made. They are as bad as the freaking sequel epidemic that has been happening with the action/superhero flicks.

How to begin again for the losers,"The chemistry between the drunker and the lost star leads to the unexpected gorgeous picture. When they listened to the song list sharing one apple mobile phone, I believe they have finished combination in music. Yep, I bet they will make love sooner or later. Thank god they don't make it in the movie. The girl still cried in the live house on her ex-boyfriend's show as he catch the essence of the song she created for him for a valentine's gift. However the satisfaction forced her to leave but not to join him on the stage. And then she picked up another way to establish her new album. It's not traditional as the way they made their album. Great joy to watch the movie as I even couldn't sit the chair peace but dance with the music and the revival of the drunker and the lost star.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A solid musical drama that takes us through the creative process of an artist,"""I just think you have let your troubles get in the way of your entire life.""There is no doubt that music has a deep influence in our lives, and there is no one who expresses this better in movies than director John Carney, who has returned to the musical drama genre after his success in 2006 with Once. Begin Again is sort of a love letter for musicians and aspiring musicians as well, reminding them about the importance of not selling out and remaining authentic. This is a big part of the dramatic narrative and Carney, a former musician himself, reminds audiences that music is personal and has a different meaning for everyone. This isn't your standard rom-com because the screenplay is written in such a way that you never can fully anticipate what direction it's heading. Rather than centering on a love relationship it focuses on a work collaboration between people who are passionate for music. Somewhere along the way they got their hearts broken and lost their motivation, but a coincidental encounter brought these two characters together and set them in the right path once again. I fell in love with these characters and found it hard to resist this feel good film. The chemistry between Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightley was special and charming. This film may have flown under many people's radar, but it is one that is worth checking out. There are plenty of authentic and funny moments while the dramatic elements are also engaging. The cinematography might not be the best we've seen, but the rich characters and charming score make up for it. Begin Again is a joyful and genuine film that pulls at your heart strings without ever feeling manipulative or clichéd.The performances are a huge part of the success of this uplifting and cheerful musical film. Mark Ruffalo has been on quite a role lately and once again he plays a rather flawed character in such a way that he still manages to remain likable for the audience. This lost musical producer seems to find his way when he encounters Keria Knightley's character in a bar one night. Knightley is fantastic as well and I felt her performance to be impressively genuine and authentic. Every scene she shared with Ruffalo felt real and the dialogue was never forced. The natural chemistry between these two is something you don't run into very often. I would go as far as saying that Knightley's performance is one of my favorite of the year. Adam Levine gives a solid performance playing this self absorbed rising star. He is a better singer, but that doesn't mean he can't act. Hailee Steinfeld has grown as a mature actress, but she has always been a force to reckon with ever since her outstanding performance in True Grit. Most Def and Catherine Keener also have solid supporting roles. Everything about this film is charming and hard to resist despite the fact that it remains small and unimportant. It's simply a feel good movie that pays homage to the influence of music in our lives, and lets us in on the creative process while at it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Positive reviews are fake?,"Guys, guys, guys... The movie was about recording a LIVE ALBUM in public - cool, right? Except the music was clearly - really, obviously - recorded all in a studio and heavily developed. Total fakeness. The definition of a lie. If the film had ANY credibility, they would have sung the real live concept album as depicted in the film.On a deeper level, the story is about overnight success. Which is NOT what real musicians - who are dedicated to their art - go through. No money. No success. Hard work. Refining the craft and honing their talent.This movie a betrayal of music and the artists who make it, not a celebration.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"It is not quite ""Once"" but still a remarkable musical","Carney's ""Once"" is one of the best musicals ever made and as such it sets a standard that is hard to live up to. ""Begin Again"" while clearly the weaker work is a great follow-up in spite of that. Like ""Once"" it strips the musical form down to its minimal trappings to focus on the simple power of music. The soundtrack is a nice blend of some classics, and a lot of great indie pop songs that works well for the characters. (If I have one complaint it would be the music is a bit too conventional). Knightley had a surprisingly soulful singing voice that makes the film very pleasant to listen too. The gimmick of recording in various locations around New York city allows the film to have a small sense of spectacle that fits well with Carney trying (and succeeding) to blend the ""Once"" template with a more traditional Hollywood musical.This desire to blend the two forms, as well as Carney's concern with selling out, echos throughout the story. It is a re-configured ""A Story is Born"" (that eternal Hollywood myth) in which a formerly great musical producers who hits rock bottom-professionally, personally-meets and shepherds a younger woman songwriter who, also, has had her share of personal failures. Unlike ""A Star is Born"" the two do not form an erotic relationship. And the film's conclusions around the tensions of art and commerce are less dire and more humanistic. More to the point, the plotting re-configures the musical tropes to be engaging and it was surprising to see how the the various parts fit together. I just like how this film bridges the gap the conventional Hollywood musical and the far more intimate ""Once.""As previously alluded to Knightley is quite good in this. She is very charming, and embodies Gretta's raw talent but also her raw pain. But to me the standout was Ruffalo. He is utter mess that gets cleaned up in this film. It may be his best career performance.Great companion piece for ""Once.""",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Notes Of Redemption,"As Laura Nyro wrote, ""Nothing cures like time and love."" This delightful story written and directed by John Carney has that as its central theme.Dan (Mark Ruffalo) has a day from hell, where all his ""debts"" come due. He gets fired from work, his car fails, and he feels disrespected by his daughter, who he rarely sees. He seeks solace in a bottle---his usual tonic---and is at his lowest when he encounters a wonderful sound.Gretta (Keira Knightly) is similarly depressed. Her visit to the states is about to end. She had invested all her energy (creatively and romantically) in a man (Adam Levine) who betrayed her, and now she longs for home. Her busker friend, Steve (James Corden), drags her into a club where he is singing, then forces her to sing one of her own songs.The following scene, where Dan unexpectedly encounters Gretta's music, is central to the story and it is the best scene, imaginatively rendered two different ways to demonstrate Dan's point of view.The film revolves around making music and the joy to be found in that. Fortunately, the cast is musically strong.The narrative flows easily, never feeling like it was shaped to fit a preconceived structure or a prototypical ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

great romantic movie,"The movie ""Start Over"" is not wildly inventive. In fact, it is quite the opposite. However, Knightley and Ruffalo are so enjoyable to watch that it was incredibly easy to come to terms with any of the film's shortcomings. Even though the pop music genre is not my favorite, the songs are pretty good and fit the movie very well. The movie ""Start Over"" is just easy. Although the movie doesn't resemble real life one bit, it doesn't matter because it's just good. Note: I still can't figure out if they were just being nice, praising Hailee Steinfeld's guitar ""solo."" Really recommend everyone to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Pulses with Uplifting Life,"Carney's Once was a pleasant little surprise that bordered on being revelatory, with sweetness and beautiful music oozing out its ears. Begin Again doesn't fall far from that tree. It's a love letter to the power of music, during the mundane and the striking alike. Are its songs as immediately beautiful as Once? No, but at times that's the point: the instant gratification of pop music versus the idealism of art. Throughout its many highs and fleeting lows, Begin Again pulses with uplifting life. The framing is wonderfully inventive, starting on the night that Ruffalo and Knightley's characters meet and then jumping back to tell us how each of them got there. It's like a movie and its prequels rolled into one. Despite a couple of hurky-jerky scene cuts, the editing and pacing is pretty great: heartfelt and truly unique, with some super fun performances. Corden has a breakout role as the comedic relief BFF, Steinfeld authentically captures precocious teen-dom, and Ruffalo is always a pleasure. His character in particular is a case study for how to show and not tell, specifically in an early and hilarious scene of him listening to demo tapes. Begin Again wears its heart on its sleeve throughout (the subtle cinematography, the effective musical themes, NYC as a character), but sometimes when you wear your heart on your sleeve it can be overbearing. All the sincere goodness in the film is slightly marred by cheesiness, yet not overwhelmingly so. It overcomes these faults with slight and firmly planted romance. Begin Again will raise your spirits without pandering to your expectations.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Great music story,"7.9 stars.You really can't go wrong with this cast of actors. Although I would never imagine a movie with this mix of so very different personalities, they converge to tell a story that is very endearing and fulfilling. Just look at the cast, how do you put this group of people together and make an orthodox and mainstream film out of it? Make it a music theme, that's how.I'm not going to go into the plot too much, I'd rather comment on how this story makes me feel inside. It's a love story, not necessarily love between two people, but more about love between music and humans bunch and how it evokes joy and fulfillment in the lives of several broken people. They come together because of music, and they depart whole again. Beautiful film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A less romantic Jerry Maguire with great music and a perfect ending. I really enjoyed and recommend this.,"""Forget the demo, let's make an album."" Dan (Ruffalo) is a music executive who has fallen on hard times. His marriage is falling apart, his relationship with his daughter is strained and he drinks too much. After his drinking goes too far he loses his job and ends up at a bar wondering what to do next. When Gretta (Knightly) steps up to the mic both of their lives change for the better. Much like the movie Words and Pictures judging by the cover I was expecting a cheesy romantic comedy that has been done over and over. Much like the movie Words and Pictures I was wrong. The best way to describe this is a music version of Jerry Maguire without the love story aspect. I really like how the movie shows what is happening from more than one persons point of view. This also shows what is wrong with most of the music executives today, focusing too much on a single song rather than the artist. My favorite line of the movie is when Gretta tells Dave that his recording of the song she wrote got lost in the production of it. The movie itself is OK, a little generic but the acting and the music really make it great and I recommend this if for no other reason than for the music and the amazing ending. Keira Knightly does all her own singing and she is actually really good. Overall, a less romantic Jerry Maguire with great music and a perfect ending. I really enjoyed and recommend this. I give it an A-.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"""Lost Stars"" won awards for a reason","Begin Again is a warm and happy Indie music video lasting nearly 2 hours. Nothing about that is bad in the slightest. This film features the best acting I have seen from Mark Ruffalo in his career (closely rivaled by Spotlight in my personal opinion) and you learn to really care for his character. Keira Knightley is also the best I have ever seen her, and has a much more beautiful voice than I expected from the Pirates of the Caribbean star. This film also features some passable acting by Adam Levine of Maroon 5. He was not the greatest actor in the film by any means, however, he holds his own remarkably well. The only negatives in this film for me was the cameo of a certain celebrity musician that solves several problems from afar for our heros in the film. This felt somewhat cheap to me, as the crime of convenience is one of my biggest pet peeves in cinema. At the end of the day, the strength of this film is the remarkable soundtrack. The music in this film is spectacular, and if you love music and movies ""Begin Again"" is worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Refreshing Fun,"I really liked this movie. The music was good as was the acting. I usually like Mark Ruffalo's laconic style, but heh, in this movie he talked a plenty! Not really a fan of Keira Knightley; I thought she was horrible in 'seeking a friend for the end of the world' - I didn't believe in her character - but in this film? Knightley was really good in my opinion - I liked her and felt I understood her. Good work by all. My husband loved Adam Levine's voice (we don't know anything about him or his songs before - gonna check him out now). So, all in all a worthwhile and enjoyable experience, modern and not really Hollywood blockbuster style romcom at all. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A good movie with excellent soundtracks,"This movie is based on a music artist and a music producer, how they meet each other and ultimately healing each other's life(through music). In all this movie has excellent soundtracks and out of hundreds of MUSIC movies out there, this movie set apart from all of them. Although the story is a bit predictable, but a must watch for everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Big Fan,"I recently just watched this film and I love it. The music, the acting, the story, it all just works so good together. Mark Ruffalo's character is a rebellious music executive who is on the brink of losing his job and has no interest in the boring music of our time. He is looking for a new sound. Keira knightley is a musician who is suffering from a bad break up and is on her last leg living in New York. The unlikely Duo meet in a dive bar where Ruffalo is convinced that Keira has the sound he has been looking for. The two embark on an epic journey creating music and adventuring through the city.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
How to make a music movie without making a musical,"Gretta (Keira Knightley), a talented musician, after her long-time boyfriend Dave (Adam Levine), a singer, betrays her, meets Dan (Mark Ruffalo), once a successful music producer now in decline, and starts to sing & heal herself. Together they'll put a band together & sing in NYC streets to make a record.Despite the obvious romantic landscape, this film is about music and how it can heal broken hearts & souls. Everyone here needs to go on with their lives and put behind them trouble times. I loved all the songs here, and I think that it would have been great a real life collaboration between Adam & Keira, they're both really talented and love music.This is how a movie that celebrates music should be, not like a musical, but more about the impact of music on our lives.So I deeply recommend watching ""Begin Again"" if you want to enjoy music or feel alive again after hard times.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
...all about integrity,"A totally non-hollywood film with a light touch and a depper theme: artists integrity. A hardly recognidable Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo are visibly having a good time as are the many hip hop and other music types, often playing parodies of themselves. Maybe a bit slow on take-off, but relaxing athmosphere alle the way and great music to be heard, from Steve Wonder to Frank Sinatra.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A musical feast,A musical feast. A must watch for music lovers. The film shows the tussle between an artist's intrinsic love for music and the commercial interest taking over the purity of music from him/her. How giving a hit becomes more important than making real music. vivid representation of making of an open album with so many sweet lovely songs . Awesome Keira steeling the show with her natural acting and amazing voice. I never knew she can sing so well. And Mark has given such a natural performance. The movie also touches on some other issues like free music vs music companies making money from commercialization of music that sometimes may be detrimental to the music itself and for the artist too. A pleasant and uplifting experience. Its all about music!,8.0,Anonymous,Music
Finding Lost Stars!,"Begin Again is an original drama about finding who you are and in the process, finding a lifelong partner who can figure out that same task. In this film that question is posed against the background of music and wonderful performances. I loved the gritty tone this film gives off. The film features more of a raw sound as we explores the lives of our characters. This film may not be the best film to be released in 2014, but it's one of the more soulful films. There are some good songs, including ""Lost Stars,"" which is beautifully sung by Adam Levine of Maroon 5 fame.John Carney's film is about a record label executive in New York City, who is struggling to keep up with the changing music industry and is in the midst of struggles with his estranged wife and daughter. While drunk at a nightclub, he is turned on by this woman named Gretta, a songwriter who broke up with her long-time boyfriend. Dan wants to sign her to a deal, but after some initial hesitation, Gretta finally agrees. Together, they embark on a journey that will change the world of music.The acting is actually quite good. We all know what a great actor Mark Ruffalo is and I think he is perfect as the man who is struggling to live life the way he wants. The main surprise is Keira Knightley. Nothing against her as an actress, but I did question her role in a film based on music. Well she can actually sing. She's no Aretha Franklin, but she can hold her own. Adam Levine does a good job as Gretta's ex, and I liked his interpretation of ""Lost Stars.""Overall, Begin Again is a solid movie that takes place in the New York City music scene. It's not the greatest movie, but it's still a captivating one. The film has a gritty soul and a heart, so I can appreciate the tone of the movie. I also liked the one scene where Ruffalo imagines a band playing during Gretta's acoustic performance. That took some good skill. A solid movie about finding your true self and your true soulmate.My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Good ole' romcom!,"What can I say? Mark Ruffalo - brilliant! Keira Knighley - same as always - excellent acting, believable character and wins over the hearts of the audience. Adam Levine - he's just Adam! It's kind of what I thought Adam was like anyway, a sweet mixture of confident, arrogance and tortured artist.The best thing about this film is the script. It's so cleverly written and a true delight to watch. A great mixture of two talented young people, one who becomes romanced and engulphed in the music bizz and then the seedy, selfish record labels and how they conduct their business. The film is topped with the undertones of romance and self discovery which really takes the audience on a journey, never mind the fact that the music is catchy and enjoyable.I'd say, add it to your watch list and make some time for this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Begin Again - Yes, Please Do!","I wonder how many people who paid good money to see this came away wishing they had known better. Some cleaver visuals can't make up for a labored, swear fest script and hammy performances... by people we know can do better - that is, if given the right ingredients. We've seen and heard it all before but thankfully, better than we are saddled with here. This may suit the 'music' followers or the genre obsessed but might prove highly torturous for many others.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Begin Again - brief,"Two broken souls meet, help each other stand, then run. Both are bruised artists, victims of commercialization over integrity. Keira Knightley plays the dumped girlfriend (and songwriter) of singer boyfriend, who is catching fire. Mark Ruffalo pitch perfect as music exec, once edgy, once influential, now living in failure. Exquisite location filming in New York as the two record, guerrilla style, in subway, in Central Park, in alleys. Music is quite good, by the way. Knightley sings her own. Her voice, somewhere between twee and shoegaze, is well suited to her character and songs. Not a love story, but a tale of redemption. Great date film, nevertheless.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great and enjoyable film about what makes life worth living,"Love this film for the performances, all of them, the sense of NYC, and, above all, the music. My favorite film of 2013 without question.Beyond the fine performances -- to be expected from Ruffalo, Knightly, Keener, Steinfeld, and Mos Def -- we have some very good work by Adam Levine and stellar music. And the English best friend chap who steals his scenes.It's a film that withstands repeated viewings -- look out for the macho tea scene -- and that begs so many great questions about love, life, art, work, children, marriage, confusion and everything that makes being on the planet worthwhile.Some will say it's a love song to NYC -- no doubt -- but for me it's a love song to music. Be on the lookout for the brother with the comb in his hair, jamming. Love love love him and any scene he's in, playing his instrument and doing this thing, brings the film from great to on fire.And Mark Ruffalo? Please, let's be sensible and give this man the Oscar he's deserved for many years now.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Feel Good Movie With Wonderful Music and Great Relationships,"This film was very uplifting and enjoyable. I love the direction they took with the music, being a movie about music you kind of expect it but I still want to mention it because it definitely stood out to me. I loved all of the band members they brought on and how much fun they had making music together, and Hailee Steinfeld made a great addition too. Knightley's friendship with Steinfeld was a lovely little extra I wasn't expecting but worked really well.I confess that I liked both of the leads before even watching this film but to see them together and their chemistry was really wonderful. They're a bit of an odd pair but you can see how they can come together and just work. It's a very feel good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Ludicrous casting,"This film could have been great with a more believable female lead than Keira Knightley. Instead of casting an actual musical talent for the role of the rough diamond discovered by Mark Ruffalo's producer-character the makers of this film thought theyd better cast a 'box office actress' who absolutely isnt a good singer and SO not a believable shooting star singer/musician, and so the film looses you from the very beginning. Mark Ruffalo always gives a film weight but there is too much cliché in the story-telling here.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Wonderful, Quirky Film","I saw this film flying from Italy to the US and absolutely fell in love with it. I love Mark Ruffalo and Keira Knightly in this film. The energy and MR's quirky delivery makes this just a fun and moving film to watch. I'm just a new huge fan of Mr. Ruffalo and I really think Keira Knightly delivers a moving and very subtle performance in this film. For anyone who is an artist or considers themselves an artist, staying true to why you are in this business is a really tricky thing.This film explores this and asks the question of every artist, ""why are you doing this?"" Also it explores how every complicated it is to maintain healthy and strong relationships in a business devoted, it seems, to an abundance of butt kissing and star making. The fact that the main character, in the face of potential stardom, chooses to remain true to her art is a testament to the craziness of the entertainment business. Remaining true to your art can mean remaining poor! LOL! It's an odd thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A tribute to music and love,"Keira Knightley, an artist for whom I have so much love and respect, and Mark Ruffalo an actor I've been watching with a lot of confusion. I was more curious about the mix, than the movie itself. With a trailer not giving away much, and a Adam Levine I can't trust with acting, watching this movie was a choice I made actually to find sleep. But what a good surprise! Begin again is a tribute to good Music. Dan (Mark Ruffalo), a producer who's fed up with the lack of consistency and depth in today's music, struggles to convince his business partner of his point, and decides to just quit. In a hopeless try to drown his pain at a bar, finds Gretta (Keira Knightley) singing with a guitar the exact music he's been looking for. At this point It may seem like a classic boring scenario where a producer discovers what's going to be the revelation of the year, sign her, they sell millions and win awards, but it's not. It's more than that, it's not even close to that. It's the quest of finding oneself, falling in love again with people that matter, and paying a tribute to good Music. I talk about Music with a real band playing drums, violin, cello and piano. The music full of love and joy and magic of the enchanting Frank Sinatra, that Michael Buble and Norah Jones tried to save for our pleasure, and that we're dying to listen to today. As a bonus a very sweet OST.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellemt,"I was totally blown away with this movie and its beautiful music...the acting, the premise of what music really is and what the industry destroys...I loved this movie and watched it 4 times.....never do I do that...its bringing relationships back again and the hope of what could lie ahead when your world falls apart....perfect picks for the cast..I could watch it again right now ..Adam Levine and his vocals were over the top...Kera Knightly was such a wonderful surprise with her vocals...Mark Ruffalo was as always amazing...this man can act in any role....he is amazing and once again nailed this character with such compassion as a father, husband and musician...I HIGHLY recommend that anyone reading this review watch this fabulous film....I was so moved by it and most likely will watch it Again and be moved once aGAIN...LOST in the music and these characters which we all can relate to.

Dreamy! Lively!,"I saw the poster intro of this movie and immediately knew that I would love it. And guess what. I more than loved it! Keira Knightley is so beautiful and raw and spontaneous. I loved her expressions and fell for her (I already had couple of times). Mark, Adam and Hailee also were brilliant. And the songs just ups the ante and were phenomenal. I am just short of words. Loved the rawness of the story, the dialogues and again Keira's expressions (again). All in all this movie is worth watching and will make you feel dreamy, drooling and long for someone.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Good songs?,"Really? I can't believe that the music portrayed in this movie represents the outstanding level required to reach success. Repetitive songs, unemotional lyrics, filled with cliches one after another that act as punctuation in a story, equally cliches crammed, until the predictable ending (not before the equally predictable troubles that seems fatal). Keira Knightley is the girl that knows-it-all; Ruffalo is required (in the movie!) not to act as Jerry Maguire, which is PRECISELY what he does! One scene after another, you are drawn to the same, old, idea that all is possible if you work hard enough, producing awful songs meanwhile.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not ""Once"" unfortunately","The thing about ""Once"" was that it was total magic: you literally watched the music and voices BECOME something. This time around, Carney assembles a way more accomplished cast with way better production value...but the magic is missing. Ruffalo does his very best, but the premise and the core song are a stretch. ""Once"" worked best when the music played, and this one works best when it stops. It is not awful, but it is not great either. There are plenty of great Ruffalo performances out there, so find another one.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Smells like fake sweat,"Ugh this was so horrible. No wonder music is dead. The plot, the songs, and the stupid fillers, we got so bored waiting for something to happen.

Cringy,"It's pretty raw for my taste. Mark Ruffalo plays a disaster of human being destroying himself and pissing off everyone around him. Per the story he's been at it for 5 years and when he's hit absolute rock bottom he happens to hear Keira Knightley timidly play one of her songs at a dive bar. He's smitten as he believes he's found his next great musician. Not a pop star, mind you, but a great musician.Anyways, I found the film very difficult to watch for the first 30 minutes as he is such a train wreck of human being. And you can pretty much see most things coming as the film plays with time to bring all the characters up to a specific point. K. Knightley's Greta has been dumped by her destined to be super-star boyfriend (amusingly play by Adam Levine) and goes along with Ruffalo's dream that she is destined to be a success. Various uncomfortable scene follow as the predicable story continues.This is not my kind of film. I just don't get into realistic portrayals of misery, but I guess others do as this seems to be popular with most commentators.I would recommend watching something with more joy in it, although it probably won't have such a stellar cast as this film.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Absolutely fantastic storyline,"Although the storyline and the acting was fantastic, for me it was addicting and right up my alley, but...but... the language for my taste, it had way come away, way too too many f-bombs, it took away from the classiness of the movie. You don't need swear words ever other sentence to have a movie unless you can't come up with a scrit so u use f-bombs as a the filler which is what it always sounds like, they couldn't think of what to say so they plucked in an f-bomb.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Really cringey,"This is one of the most terrible films I have seen in quite a while. The songs which are supposed to be so good are blatantly awful commercial love songs with zero emotional content, the musical equivalent of a crayon drawing of a flower in a pot with a happy sun and maybe a bird flying in the background. In other words, completely inane garbage. Knightly's acting is a travesty -she goofily smiles her way through most situations. Her singing and performing are so boring and cringe inducing at the same time that it induces mild panic. I could feel my mind rapidly beginning to melt in my skull with each new song, so I was forced to fast forward through the music, or I feared my ears and mind would never be the same. What could be worse than her song, why of course the music of Adam Levine, which is also featured heavily throughout. The premise of this is complete fantasy, that a sensationally great songwriter would write rote, idiotic three chord songs with generic melodies, and be poised for stardom if only a record company will realize the genius of utterly terrible music. How does she live? No job, no place to live, no money, she just eats artistic integrity? I wanted to hit myself in the head with a hammer about 10 times while watching this. Ruffalo is good, Keener is good, of course, they always are, but neither should have agreed to do this film. The best part by far is the on location background of NYC, which is at least real and interesting.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
This is kind of movie that gives you a smile,"The movie 'Begin Again' is an American musical comedy drama released in 2013. John Carney who had a huge success through the movie 'Once' directed and wrote the whole movie. The story was partly inspired by his own experiences as a musician in a band. Adam Levine of Maroon5,Keira Knightly and Mark Ruffalo are the leading actors. They began filming in July 2012 in various locations around New York City. It is a great movie showing the beauty of the city with music.An independent songwriter 'Gretta James'(Keira Knightly) moves to New York because her boyfriend 'Dave Kohl'(Adam Levine) gets a contract with a major music company. However, Gretta gets dumped by her boyfriend so she moves out right away. Later on a formerly successful record label executive 'Dan Mulligan'(Mark Ruffalo) being fired from his job encounters Gretta in a bar and asks her to make an album with him. They produce a street band and start singing and recording in the streets of the city to make their own album together.Begin Again was filmed in several locations that show the distinct characteristics of New York;By the lake of Central Park, a rooftop overlooking the Empire state building, China town, and the subway. The city is like a huge character of this movie. Every time the band starts playing music in the street, a number of the camera angles shows various scenery of the city that you couldn't have seen anywhere from other movies. It includes the realistic sounds of the field, so it gives an impression of traveling through the city. John Carney elaborately made an effort to show the beauty of New York so he actually traveled the city to decide where to do the filming. Also, the soundtrack of the movie is great. As the director is famous for his previous music drama, he portrays love and the feelings of the characters through music. All the songs are very appealing and were very popular for a long time.New York is known as a big dreary city but in this movie it changes to a very peaceful place through the music. The music stuck in my head so I couldn't get over the warm feeling that comes from the movie. This is the kind of movie that gives you a smile and puts you in a good mood.",,Anonymous,Music
Review Excerpts,"Knightley and Ruffalo are nicely natural as the increasingly idealistic musos who discover that a song can save your life, their streetwise story mutating into an anti-establishment fairytale with added exhaust fumes.-- Mark Kermode, The GuardianGreta may not be the new Joni Mitchell, but she becomes a sort of Good Witch of the West Village. She not only revives Dan's career, but also sparks his reconciliation with estranged wife Miriam (Catherine Keener) and bitter teenage daughter Violet (Hailee Steinfeld). This would be preposterous if not for the vivacious Knightley, an irresistibly watchable force of nature ever since Bend It Like Beckham. The music industry, like girls' soccer, can't help but be overwhelmed. Benevolent Greta teaches Violet about boys and clothes, and even enlists her to play a guitar solo. The girl holds back for nearly the whole song, apparently intimidated, but then just in time picks up her guitar and nails it. It's a moment that, like the movie itself, is both laughable and sweet.-- Mark Jenkins, NPRMoney and ambition constitute an awkward subtext in ""Begin Again."" Gretta has strong, not entirely persuasive opinions about authenticity and integrity, which Dan, at once a dreamer and a hustler, both mocks and respects. The film's ideas about how musicians make their living are more than a little disingenuous. The bright line it wants to draw between passion and commerce is perpetually blurredDespite the unaffected acting, the characters are less individuals than axioms, and their relationships are carefully graphed to yield predictable emotional results.-- A. O. Scott, New York Times.",,Anonymous,Music
A positive story,"This film tells the story of a record executive who has fallen out of favour, and a woman whose singer boyfriend is having an affair. Their chance encounter in a bar sparks the start of a journey that helps both of them to get back on their feet.The plot is a positive one, as everyone gets something positive out of the bad night they initially had. Mark Ruffalo gets back into the music industry, Keira Knightley gets to make an album, even the wife and the daughter of Mark Ruffalo gets a great outcome out of the experience. I like the songs in the film, but I get the feeling that there are really too much singing scenes. It was as if I was watching an extended music video. I think they do not really have to play the whole song every time, a snippet will help the soundtrack sale already.",,Anonymous,Music
