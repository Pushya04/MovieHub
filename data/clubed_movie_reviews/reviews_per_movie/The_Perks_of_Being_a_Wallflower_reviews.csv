We are infinite,"Greetings again from the darkness. Brace for gushing. Last evening I attended a screening that included a fascinating Q&A with writer/director Stephen Chbosky. It reminded me of how personal and intimate and observant and incisive a well-made film can be. A well written script is so refreshing, and an exceptional script can be truly breath-taking. Mr. Chbosky takes the unusual step of directing his own screenplay based on his own novel (a 1999 bestseller), and he left me stunned and enthralled.The popularity of the novel would typically make the film version a disappointment for its fans. Not so this time. Mr. Chbosky remains true to the spirit despite the need to edit for the sake of continuity and brevity. The key characters spring to life thanks to the efforts of four strong performances from young actors: Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson, The Three Muskateers) plays Charlie, Emma Watson (Harry Potter films) is Sam, Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin, City Island) is Patrick, and Mae Whitman (Arrested Development) is Mary Elizabeth.If you have read the book, you know the story ... you know the characters ... you know the themes. If you haven't read the book, I will spoil nothing. The brilliance is recognized only as you get to know these characters and slowly uncover their stories. What we discover is that, regardless of our age, we recognize these characters from our high school days. We know the introverted, observant Charlie who so desperately needs a support system. We surely recognize the attention-starved, lacking in self-esteem Sam who is the epitome of ""We accept the love we think we deserve"". And we all knew a Patrick ... the flamboyant one who sheaths his pain with an over-the-top act of public confidence. What Chbosky does is shine the spotlight on these characters to ensure that we really SEE them this time.The themes reminded me a bit of a darker John Hughes film (that's a compliment). There were also pieces of two other really good films: Stand By Me and Almost Famous. The formative years of a writer determine the depths to which his or her work will reach later in life. Admittedly, the film is substantially autobiographical, so when Mr. Chbosky says it's a personal story, we begin to understand the foundation of his remarkable writing style.""Welcome to the island of misfit toys."" When this line is spoken, we realize that most every high school kid has thought the same thing at some point. These are painful and difficult times and as Mr. Chbosky stated, we should encourage kids to fight through this stage and get on to the next ... then able to find their true self. Clearly, the film made a strong impact on me. My favorite reaction to a movie is profound thought, and this one caused this in waves. The decision to release as PG-13 was wise. There is no excess of profanity or nudity to divert attention from what really matters ... the characters. I can think of no finer compliment to a writer and filmmaker than to cite them as the cause of my internal discussions related to their film. My hope is that you have the same reaction.

Saw this at TIFF 2012,"Saw this movie at TIFF and after watching the trailer was thinking I was going to enjoy this movie. Those expectations now are so very low, this movie is amazing. It speaks on many different levels of being a teenager, dealing with death, loneliness, and how awkward it can be trying to fit in. I haven't seen a move like this in a very long time and was very refreshing. The highlight of the film for me at least from a acting stand point is Ezra Miller really funny, but very heartfelt at the same time. Don't get me wrong the whole case is amazing (Emma Watson was perfect for this after HP) but Ezra really stands out. Stephen Chbosky really cared about this book, and it really shows in this film. Him Directing and writing his own book was a amazing idea.It's going to get many comparisons to a John Hughes film, and rightfully so this movie is heart felt and just amazing.I will definitely being seeing this film again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An homage to youth which takes the kids' problems seriously,"High school films devoid of archetypes are few and far between, and the same goes for high school films that don't adopt a goofy approach. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an exception in both categories, and still it is every bit as enjoyable as the most audience-friendly films in this subgenre. They key, I suspect, is that the director is also the screenwriter and the novelist behind the book upon which the film is based. His name is Stephen Chbosky, and he takes the problems of youth every bit as seriously as John Hughes did in The Breakfast Club in the 1980s. Based on his 1999 novel of the same name, his script is full of care for and understanding of these kids, and he's able to transfer the literary quality to the screen without making it feel contrived. He also seems to be a real actors' director, giving his wonderful cast time to blossom and develop together. There's an undeniable bond and unity between particularly the trio Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller, and rarely have teenagers come across as more human and real than they do here. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a homage to youth, and a really enjoyable one at that.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not Just a High School Movie,"Went to an advance screening expecting your usual ""shy kid in high school learns to stick up for himself"" sort of feel-good drama. This movie is so much more than that - I was truly blown away by the mature themes and moving characters. Mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol... I think the writer/screenwriter/director said it best in the Q+A after when he said it was a film that looked at the emotional aspects of that point in life without being sentimental. I really cared about these three teens - Charlie, Sam, and Patrick - and their story never felt cheesy. Just real, and moving, and touching. Go see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best of 2012 so far.,"I had the pleasure of seeing Perks Of Being A Wallflower at Arclight Cinemas in LA yesterday and it was definitely worth the one hour drive.The story is very simple yet complicated because of how much goes on. But the way it unfolds is beautiful and sad, sometimes all at once. While it has its funny moments, it also manages to go through dark topics as well such as homosexuality, drugs and death. Stephen Chbosky handles his story very well, never feeling like it's being forced but rather it flowed nicely and carefully.Directing wise, it was shot very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of Pittsburgh and during intimate scenes between the characters. You could not get anyone better to direct it other than the author himself because this is his book. This is his vision so he knows exactly how it goes in his head and we can see throughout the film, just how much his vision has truly come alive. The result is both engaging and satisfying.Same thing with the writing. The dialogue is very honest and beautifully well written. It was very fun to quote along with the movie. Not just the writing but the overall tone of the film reminds me a little bit of John Hughes' work. Adapting a epistolary book into a film is incredibly challenging but Mr. Chbosky did a fine job of translating it into a film.The musical score is done by Michael Brook who's also responsible for Into The Wild, another favorite of mine, and he did a very good job. In fact, one of the scores made me cry because of how it emotionally resonated with the scene it was fitting in. The soundtrack is awesome. Along with Mr. Chbosky, Alexandra Patsavas, who's also the music supervisor for The OC, did a great job of picking out the songs and treated it as if it were a mix tape.Logan Lerman, my god, he did a masterful job as Charlie. The character literally jumped out of the book and made its way onto the big screen. Logan's performance blew me away. He did such an amazing job portraying the embodiment of Charlie through his expressions, his emotions, his movements, everything! So perfectly cast. The last 10 minutes of the movie alone is awards worthy because it really shows how talented he really is. I fell in love with his performance. So perfect in every way.Emma Watson did a great job playing as Sam. She is very beautiful and charming. As for her American accent, I thought she did an okay job. There were times where you can kind of hear her British accent slip in and even though you notice it, it's nothing distracting and it didn't really bother me. But you have to give her credit for trying her best and she truly did. I enjoyed her performance very much.The second standout of the film is Ezra Miller! He plays Patrick, a gay character who's not afraid of who he is and Ezra portrays him amazingly well. I've seen almost all of his work, and he's becoming a great actor who's very rare in the sense that he's brave and daring in contrast to the roles he has previously played. He steals every line and scene he's in, becoming the comic relief. But even so, Patrick has his own personal problem and this is where Ezra Miller proves once again just how great of an actor he is.Everyone else in their supporting roles all have their moments. Nina Dobrev, who plays Candance aka Charlie's sister, did a good job. Mae Whitman as Mary Elizabeth was hilarious. Adam Hagenbuch as Bob was great. Erin Wilhelmi as Alice, Johnny Simmons as Brad and Nicholas Braun as Derek were all fine.The rest of the cast: Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott who play the parents as well as Joan Cusack who plays Charlie's Doctor were all good, despite having little screen time. Melanie Lynskey did a very good job as Aunt Helen. Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson is awesome. He's also a standout. Paul Rudd in general is a very likable actor and again, he doesn't have a lot of screen time either but he still manages to play his part memorably.What makes the cast so special is the chemistry. Everyone got along so well and you can tell that they're very comfortable with each other and you feel convinced that these people are really friends. It was absolutely perfect.I love this movie. It's amazing. And I'm not just saying this because I'm a die-hard fan of the book. It has a great script, great cast, it's well directed, awesome soundtrack and undeniable strong performances. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower may not be the most faithful adaptation but the spirit of the story is still there and it does great justice to the book. This is one of the best coming of age movies I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Being Infinite,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is another story about a simple guy living in a cruel life of high school. The difference is he's not ought to save the day, wants to lose his virginity, seeking to be popular, or revenge on his bullies. The story is about a shy kid who wants to get along with people and can't wait to leave high school. Behind it is the genuine pain and emotion of the characters which makes it more than just another story about teenagers. Stephen Chbosky tells his own story on screen pretty well and the performances are quite excellent. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is often heartbreaking, charming, and wonderful.Charlie is palpably just another teenage protagonist, but he is not one of those who tries to prove everyone who mistreated him wrong. His goal is to get away from being anti-social and be like anyone else in high school. We may have heard a story like this before, but what makes this one extraordinary is when it mostly depicts the darkest aspects of their lives. Expressing the most heartbreaking truths about these teenagers. Knowing their problems easily makes it reasonable for us to care about them. The romance is rather credibly lovely than a mainstream claptrap. In the joyous moments, it's pretty delightful and plays a quite nostalgic soundtrack.The film gives the actors some nuance. This is probably a good thing for Logan Lerman. He usually plays the simple charming guy in movies. Since he's good at those, he adds some credibility to Charlie. Emma Watson is likable enough as Sam. The best among the three is Ezra Miller. One might hams it up for Patrick, but Miller gave the character a genuinely wonderful personality.The director and author, Stephen Chbosky, didn't try anything else than to bring his book to life. He tells it straightforward on screen with plenty of strong, effective emotions. The cinematography is bright and beautiful enough. The tunnel scene has the best shots. While the soundtrack is too conspicuous, the music score is noticeably melancholic.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is best if you can actually relate to the lead character or have experienced the struggles of being an adolescent. When it's not depressing, the film goes to those blissful moments that make us remember the good times in high school. Overall, it's a great film. It's a film adaptation that replaces the cliché mainstream swagger with some painful realities and simply let the audience understand the whole point of it. In the end, it's quite a remarkable film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Exceptionally Infinite,"Stephen Chbosky has taken his exceptional novel and made it an extraordinary film. As the opening credit rolled I was impressed with the quality of the cast including Emma Watson, Paul Rudd, Kate Walsh, and Dylan McDermott. And to top it off, Joan Cusak is there as well.This is a story of coming of age and coming to terms of a boy entering high school and adulthood. Freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) almost by accident becomes friends with Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson). Soon he is hanging out learning about the ins and outs of being a teen. But there is something that is left unsaid, is it about his last best friend or his aunt.Chbosky must have been blessed by John Hughes. Not only capturing this timeless story with every word and sight, the film's soundtrack blows me away. Not many can take a book of such depth and keep the heart and soul of it alive, but it happened here. Go to the theatre and see it. Check out the book and read it. But most of all, Stay Infinite!",,Anonymous,Romance
"Young Cast Give Amazing Performances, Great Soundtrack, Emotionally Moving","I absolutely loved this film - specifically the acting, music and even at times the cinematography. Steven Chbosky captured the spirit of the book and the characters magnificently - Ezra and Logan give exceptional performances that deserve major credit. Emma gives a strong performance as Sam - you can tell that she really understands the character, however she does struggle a bit with the American accent. Not to worry - she's in Bling Ring next year and will have improved by then, she does a great job of finding her ground and portraying a troubled yet lovable and wonderful teen, at times her actions speak much louder than her words. Logan is phenomenal at every aspect of Charlie - awkward, unsure, emotional, honest - he gives an amazing performance. Ezra is hilarious but not gimmicky, and can flip to a somber tone at a moment's notice and have everyone spellbound. Also great performances from Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev and Johnny Simmons. The young cast is truly the heart of the film and are all really great. There is a lot of humour, emotion, honesty, everything it needed, and also an excellent soundtrack to back it up.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Well Done,"I just saw the movie at the Pgh premiere and it was amazing. I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed because I loved the book so much. The movie is very true to the book. A few things have been omitted or changed but it doesn't change the mood of the story. I think the casting choices were spot on. Emma Watson has a scene in which she tears up and cries and it was amazing. I also appreciate how Chbosky made the parents thoughtful people, unlike most teen comedies. I am definitely going to see this movie again because there was so much to take in. Very well done.It's also lovely to see my hometown as the backdrop. Pgh is a beautiful city and coming out of the Fort Pitt tunnels into the city is an experience that isn't quite captured well enough in the film. It's still a powerful scene and I teared up watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
And those perks would be...???,"I'm not sure. I wanted to like this film, but I felt like I'd seen it all before elsewhere and better. The narrative is a little too crowded for it's own good - and no one gets full attention, though all deserve it. Unlike some, I think the script might have benefited from being set in a specific time and place (it is, 1990's Pittsburgh - but it is never stated). Like so much of this MTV book of the month selection, it tries to be universal instead of specific - even in it's characters. Joan Cussack is billed, but her role amounts to two scenes at the VERY end of the film, so (although she's no 'star' attraction) you spend most of the time thinking ""I thought Joan Cussack was in this?"" But I guess this film is meant for a generation who doesn't know Joan Cussack, is texting during the credits, and doesn't know Pittsburgh, and wasn't alive in 1990.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Chix Chat on Film Review: Not your typical teenage angst tale.,"The Perksas it were, was a bit of a marvel when discussing what teenagers have to contend with. Anyone that decides to see this film expecting a run of the mill high school drama or teenage angst tale will be pleasantly surprised at the depth with which this story delves. This adaptation of Stephen Chbosky's novel seemed to take the difficulties facing one young man embarking on his high school journey through one extreme situation after another. I could visualize a totally different version of this tale of misfit toys being played out where all is right with the world and Charlie (Logan Lerman) is the most popular freshman in school for the simple fact that all his friends are seniors. The immediate infatuation that Charlie had with Sam (Emma Watson) was no surprise, what did surprise me was the challenges that she and her step brother Patrick/Nothing (Ezra Miller) had to endure. Even I started to get annoyed as the school year progressed and the running 'Nothing' joke persisted. It's always surprising when a story focuses on well to do young people whose lives would be expected to mimic a fairytale. This story gives insight into the fact that some young people have the same if not even more struggles than others and having money can't really fix that. I found it interesting that there was no clear indication in the story as to the school year, even at graduation there was none of the typical 'Class of '92' or whatever to show how proud of their time graduates are. It may be that Mr. Chbosky wanted to steer clear of associating the story with a specific year, but it was obviously the early 90's when the primary mode of sharing and exchanging music was via cassette. I recall so very clearly the good old days when the 'mix tape' ruled. I have to say that I liked Emma Watson as an American teenager, she can cross the pond and put it down any time. Yes there were a few moments in her dialog that she sounded like Hermione, but this role did a great deal to paint her in a different and mature light. I am not drawn to tales of the human condition unless there is a deep truth to be gleaned from the story, so if I had to say the moral of the story is It would be 'you gotta have friends'. This story worked because of what the three key characters gained from getting to know each other. I give it a green light.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cliché,"Mostly a trite and clichéd high school picture. Logan Lerman is miscast as a moody high school freshman (who looks like he' at least 16) who befriends a group of seniors (Ezra Miller, Emma Watson and Mae Whitman chief amongst them) who help him come out of his shell. That's not too unbelievable, but it becomes increasingly silly when Whitman becomes romantically involved with him, and Stone, on whom Lerman is crushing, would probably be game if she weren't already involved. This plays out like a fantasy, not reality. If you've ever been in a high school as an adult the maturity difference between freshmen and seniors - Hell, freshmen and sophomores - is hugely pronounced. Even among alterna-kids, no 18 year old girl is going to even think about dating a 14/15 year old. I couldn't quite get over that, but that's hardly the only flaw. Ezra Miller is definitely the stand-out. His homosexual character is a bit cliché, but I was happy that they actually weren't afraid to give him a sex life (though not graphic, I'm surprised it didn't land an R-rating because of it).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautifully blossomed wallflower,"Stephen Chbosky's 1990s-set very young adult-oriented book is brilliant, being funny, touching, insightful, thought-provoking and relatable. Hearing that Chbosky also directed and screenplay-adapted, as well as being attracted by the involvement of Paul Rudd and Joan Cusack, expectations were high...and although the book has more depth to the characters and situations those expectations were met.'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' may not break new ground and it may be clichéd, which may be reasons enough for people to hate it, but considering the main target audience and being based around coming-of-age, teenage angst and high school life these were inevitable. Nonetheless, 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' did a great job making an emotionally varied film that will resonate with most people of all ages and gender.It is much more than just another high school/teenage angst film, and is a believable depiction of coming-of-age, friendship and hidden torment that makes one nostalgic and remember the fun and difficulties of school life. It's not flawless, some scenes and transitions like the blackouts end rather abruptly, it occasionally descends into schmaltz like with the past flashbacks and the Charlie and Mary Elizabeth relationship while charming is rushed and makes Mary Elizabeth less likable compared to the rest of the film.However, 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is beautifully shot and clearly loves the scenery. The music is suitably melancholic and the choice of songs infectious and nostalgia-inducing especially David Bowie and an excerpt of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' in one of 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower's' most entertaining scenes, that made me love that film all over again and captured the immense fun, wildness and danger of seeing it in theatres with an audience.Chbosky adapts his book admirably, not everything is included which is not unexpected due to it being an adaptation and not every detail can translate to a just over an hour and a half film. The spirit however is there, there are funny moments, thoughtful moments, insightful moments, inspirational moments and poignant moments balanced beautifully. For a film director debut, he also does a more than competent job, actually very impressive and puts directors who did it for years to wildly variable success to shame.When it comes to the story, it is not perfect in execution but made me care for the characters and their situations and made me laugh, smile, cry and inspired in equal measure. The daring ending is shocking and brought tears to my eyes and credit is due tackling such mature themes with sensitivity and never preaching. The characters are compelling.Logan Lerman has never been better and being a fellow shy introvert in school it was easy for me to relate to him, while Emma Watson (even with the variable accent) gives one of her better non-Hermione Granger performances and overall. Mae Whitman shows strong comedic chops and Ezra Miller is a real standout on a flamboyant and hilarious role.Not that the adults are less good. A long way from that, even with less screen time. Paul Rudd is particularly great as the teacher that inspires Charlie the most, again having had an inspirational teacher in school and an even more inspirational head of department at music college that also resonated with me. Joan Cusack only appears at the end but she is very good at being sympathetic yet firm. Again Melanie Lynskey has very short screen time, but she also excels at making us hate her for being the catalyst for Charlie's torment. Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott have very little to do but fare well too.Overall, an excellent film that blossoms beautifully despite its faults. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Overrated,"This film is about a shy high school misfit who becomes a cool guy after two seniors taking him under their wings.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" tells a story of a shy guy who blossoms socially as he develops friendships with two step-siblings. It involves the typical American high school life; with experimentation in sex and drugs, experiences with dating, fights and bullying. I can see how a lot of people can identify with the characters and events in the film, and hence ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" gets such a high rating. However, I think it is overrated. I thought it was a plain coming of age drama. It doesn't push that many boundaries, and there is nothing new. The story is not particularly captivating, and in fact the subtle subplots (involving flashbacks) can be confusing. My friends and I did not agree with the positive critics and the high ratings.",,Anonymous,Romance

An affectionate and likable teen drama,"American high-school movies. Yes another one. In tackling the pitfalls and plateaus of adolescence, many films have fallen along the bad side of cliché, however it's important to remember that like every genre (well, nearly) it has had its successes; for me, John Hughes seminal The Breakfast Club instantly springs to mind, along with others such as Pretty in Pink, Mean Girls and Clueless. Fortunately, The Perks of Being a Wallflower takes a decent stab at falling into the same category as these films; and while it doesn't scale to their heights, it's a surprisingly likable coming-of-age drama.Based on Stephen Chbosky's 1999 bestseller on the same name (he also writes and directs here), the film concerns freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) as he experiences difficulty at home and school. However, he falls in with a group of seniors, including Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), who show him what is to be a ""wallflower"". He encounters depression, suicide, drugs, alcohol, homophobia, love, heartbreak, David Bowie and The Rocky Horror Picture Show.I was sincerely taken aback by the fact that Charlie did not annoy me; too many high-school films and TV shows nowadays centre of smart- mouthed, wiser-than-their years teens, so it was refreshing to have one relatable and natural. This is mainly due to Lerman who delivers a sincere and engaging performance. While Emma Watson shows clear evidence of a career beyond Potter. However, it's Miller who's the standout; after holding his own with the brilliant Tilda Swinton in We Need to Talk About Kevin, he doesn't disappoint, despite being saddled with the 'flamboyant gay best friend' role.Chbosky's direction is nothing to marvel at and the script not one of the year's best, but overall, to quote South Park's Deapartment of Interior Security Guy, it's ""fine, just fine"". A sweet, enjoyable and honest look at those years we'll never forget.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Perks of Being a Wallflower has perhaps the most realistic touching of teen relationships depicted on film,"When one watches a movie about high school life, one doesn't always expect realism especially if the characters are nothing but stereotypes of jocks, cheerleaders, and nerds, or geeks, to use the more current term. But The Perks of Being a Wallflower, based on a popular novel whose author also wrote the screenplay and directed the film, seems to accurately capture what it was like during the late '80s/early '90s to be offbeat and withdrawn and to still manage to have some fun despite troubles with family, social conventions, and the discovery of one's sexuality during the painful adolescent phase. The young people picked to play the main parts are all good at what they did here, but Emma Watson-previously best known as Hermione in the Harry Potter series-is really a standout as the troubled-but-determined Senior named Sam whose friendship with the lead Freshman character named Charlie (Logan Lerman) is perhaps the most touching of the relationships depicted here. I really loved the way things happened in this movie, so on that note, I highly recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sets a new benchmark for what the coming-of-age genre can accomplish,"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" redefines the classic American coming-of-age story. Writer/director Steven Chbosky has raised the bar on the traditional adolescent drama, with an emotionally-charged narrative infused with just enough bold strokes of joy and heartbreak to set a new benchmark for what the genre can accomplish.Based on Chbosky's own novel of the same name, the movie is about growing up in a tough and unforgiving world, yes, with its requisite lessons on overcoming obstacles. But it also touches on tragic notions of loss and grief, rarely explored in coming-of-age films with such mastery.Chbosky has said that if viewers take away one message from the film, it's that ""you are not alone."" This seemingly simple thought can't come at a better time, as bullying and its often devastating consequences have dominated headlines in recent months.The book's premise is deceptively straightforward. 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) keeps a diary of letters addressed to someone real or imagined. ""Dear Friend,"" each entry begins, as he recalls his tumultuous high school days, celebratory one moment, heartbreaking the next, but always poignant and full of promise. The movie brings Charlie's writing to life, with a charming cadre of schoolmates (and the occasional peripheral adult) taking the stage as Charlie stands in the spotlight. It's an ideal structure for a narrative as free of boundaries as the promising world of the adolescent. Charlie is everyteen, we've all been there, or have we? The Perks of Being a Wallflower wanders down paths seldom seen on screen, into surprisingly shocking territory that challenges audiences to open their hearts.The indie look and feel of the film is undeniable from the start. Single-point lighting is used effectively as a plot device. Charlie's face often appears split down the center, one side brightly lit, the other in soft shadow, mirroring his conflicted soul and sense of confusion, trapped between two worlds. Light falls gently on him when he's serene, more harshly in moments of crisis. The darkness hides the secrets he deftly keeps to himself as the narrative unfolds.Audiences of all ages will be able to relate to the 80s modern rock soundtrack -- evocative songs you undoubtedly know and love, spanning generations from Boomers to today's teens. Sound design is brilliantly orchestrated with action timed perfectly to the music cues. Michael Brook's original score is appropriately minimal. Nothing needs to be underlined here in a story that has no filler or room to breathe. Not a frame is wasted on extended character development or conventional transitions in this visualization of Charlie's nonstop roller-coaster of a diary.Andrew Dunn's stunning cinematography patiently engages the viewer, eschewing the hand-held shaky cam style so prevalent in the genre. His use of slow motion dolly shots brings us, literally, into Charlie's world. The boy's fear and sense of unease is heightened by intense closeups that reveal the bittersweet emptiness in his eyes. There's a lot more going on in that youthful head than he allows those around him to see, but even he isn't aware of it. We are but voyeurs, watching, examining, trying to make sense of Charlie's vulnerability and confusion.Editor Mary Jo Markey's loving hand allows us to embrace the plot's twists and turns without skipping a beat. The pace is calm but deliberate, and it's clear that Dunn, Markey, and the rest of the production team are as devoted to Chbosky's vision as a boy experiencing his first romance. You only have one chance to get it right.Chbosky has unquestionably assembled one of the most talented young ensemble casts in recent memory. As Charlie's love interest Sam, 22-year-old Emma Watson dominates the screen with the maturity and wisdom that only a polished veteran could bring to the role. Nina Dobrev, Julia Garner, and Mae Whitman are the free-spirited girls who surround Charlie and attempt to bring him to life. Their performances shine with an authenticity that is clearly rooted in passion for the material. On the male side, Johnny Simmons portrays football jock Brad, whose enigmatic personality figures prominently in the story in ways which will be left to the viewer. Nicholas Braun and Reece Thompson are standouts in support and much-needed comic relief.As Charlie's would-be best friend Patrick, Ezra Miller is shockingly brilliant as a gay-go-lucky teen who lives life as if every day is his last. His joie de vivre is infectious and vacuums the pain out of anyone who comes near.But ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" primarily rests on the shoulders of Logan Lerman. As Charlie, his ability to play down to 15 (he was 19 at the time) owes itself to a physical transformation he brings to every role -- in this case, widening his eyes and keeping an expressionless face that projects puppy dog innocence. His posture, walk, and pattern of speech all serve to underscore Charlie's youthful vulnerability. However ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is remembered, wherever it stands in the pantheon of coming-of-age pictures, Lerman's authentic characterization of Chbosky's semi-autobiographical protagonist should stand as one of the most iconic adolescent portrayals of our time.Some films are intensely personal, and that's as it should be. Art should move you, and you bring your own life experience to the table when considering it. ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" was so much more than I imagined. I expected to be moved but I had no idea where the film would take me. Whether or not you will be similarly affected is something you'll need to discover for yourself. I think you will.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good but a bit scary to this old fashioned father.,"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a good movie. However, as a father of two girls in college, watching this film is a bit tough for me, as I WANT to assume that real young people don't do drugs, stand up in fast-moving cars, have sex, or, well...have sex. But I also know this naive and although I would hate for younger teens to see this movie (as it might give them a sense that they should grow up too fast), it IS a good film. Far from perfect,...but a good film.The film is about a very insecure and withdrawn young man entering high school. He doesn't fit in and knows it. However, surprisingly, he does soon get taken into a small group of friends--friends who are seniors and mostly have a lot of hangups too. It takes place over this single year of high school and ends when the older friends go off to college.The film has a very smart script. Sometime, perhaps a bit too smart because too often the kids come off as a bit hipster-ish and too glib. But it is very enjoyable throughout and quite poignant--and deals with some VERY tough and complex topics--some of which are rarely ever addressed. While I don't think the movie is as wonderful as most (since it's in the IMDb Top 250 List), it is quite good and excellent for an audience 16 and up...well, perhaps 17 and up.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A little masterpiece, incredibly touching","I never read the book this film is based on. It was never on my radar to watch. It wasn't a film I was even planning to see. And guess what? It turned out to be a gem of high proportions.Now, the cast here is all wonderful, and the three leads all work perfectly. Miller and Watson are great, and the former has some really great scenes that would definitely put him in my Supporting Actor line- up. But the real star here is Logan Lerman. I don't have any say on how he portrayed the character in the novel, but what he did here amazed me to no end. His ability to reflect so many of his characters' past with such simple glances is incredible. It would have been so easy to make the silent-type lead teenage boy feel lazy or uninspired, and even in a lessor actor's hands it could have felt that way. But Lerman is mesmerizing from start to finish, never once hitting a false note or detaching himself from the emotional weight his character is living under. This is one of the best teenage performances I've ever seen, and as of right now easily the best performance of the year. Granted, I haven't seen most of the awards contenders, but this is truly incredible stuff and Lerman has enormous talent that I really hope carries him through a long and successful career.These kinds of films are always hard to navigate exactly. It's kind of hard to not fall into clichés or stereotypes. At first glance it seems like there's nothing that makes this stand apart from other films of this kind. Granted, I don't watch many that are under this specific genre simply because they never seem like anything out of the ordinary. So to be as moved by the film as I was, for it to have emotionally touched me the way it did is a huge surprise. Technically this isn't some high achievement, but there is no other film as emotionally rich this year. The characters and story lines all work in marvelous ways. I can't even say that some of it wasn't familiar territory because most of it verges on what we have seen before. And it's not perfect, some of the dialogue at times is a bit clunky, some of the plot mechanics. But it all comes together to create what is to me, a deeply, deeply personal film. I connected with the characters in ways I forgot were possible. There have been many great films in recent years, but I don't think there's been one that has reminded me of who I am as a person or who I was, what my life has been like, what life in general is like, this much. I always dread sentimentality, and if anything I am easily put off by any kind of emotional manipulation. But this is the only film in a long time that really was trying to be as emotionally investing as it could be, and one that never hit any real false notes when it came to the emotions it stirred in me.I've always said that as great as any story lines or characters are in observing a film you've seen, the art of film is ultimately a medium of feeling, just like any other art form. And this is why I haven't mentioned, really, any of the plot. Being able to talk about how it made me feel is enough, and this is a film where the emphasis on the word ""feel"" is all but deserved. This is a small gem of a film, but as rich of an experience as one could hope for. The best film of 2012.",,Anonymous,Romance
It doesn't get better than this.,"I kinda wish someone had warned me about this film, and at the same time, kinda happy I had no idea what was coming. If I had known exactly what this film was about, I may have been slightly reticent to go see it by myself, but I think I would have been equally as embarrassed to have seen it with other people.Why? Because five minutes in, the film managed to grab hold of me on an emotional level like no film has done in decades, forcing me to fight against tears tooth and nail right through until the credits began to roll. And I am not exaggerating. Not even remotely. And I just barely won the fight.With that in mind, I'll keep the details to a minimum, but I warn you, if my words move you to see this film, you may want to go in prepared (or wait for the DVD), although little could have prepared me for such a beautifully honest and gut-wrenching film.Charlie is a loner. He had a best friend, but that friend is gone. He's about to start high school, but just doesn't quite fit in anywhere. A brilliant student with a complete lack of social skills. That is, until he finds every ounce of courage he has to speak with Patrick. And suddenly, he is introduced to a world of people kind of like him. People who don't need to question him to understand him.He found a band of wallflowers.I was well-aware that this little indie-ish film had been extremely well-received by critics, and has managed a moderate box office. However, what piqued my interest is the fact that, as Oscar murmurs pick up strength and sail from whispers to rumbles, critics after critic have randomly called this movie out of left field as a film that should up ""for your consideration."" All I could think was, ""Wow, really? A teen movie is THAT good?"" Well, without hesitation, I can say with all honesty that it is really that good. I will go as far to say that it may just be the best film I have seen all year.Much of the Oscar whispers focus on two things: the flawless script by Stephen Chbosky (who adapted the film from his own epistolary 1999 novel of the same name and also directed) and Ezra Miller. After a phenomenal turn as a tormented teen in last year's exquisitely disturbing ""We Need to Talk about Kevin,"" Miller's Patrick is indeed an incredibly memorable young man, playing a teen held back at school with skin that has become so thick, he is not a victim of the torment of his peers, but has instead learned to embrace it. Emma Watson, in her first post-""Harry Potter"" starring role, is stunning as Sam, in terms of both her physicality and her acting, the beautiful young woman who is trying to put her past behind her and find her place in the world. But, in my humble opinion, the bulk of emotional gravitas radiates from the film's rising star, Logan Lerman. As the conflicted, unstable and completely lost Charlie, Lerman's performance is nothing short of revelatory. With every look, awkward touch and utterance from his mouth, he is like Michael Cena stripped of sarcasm and overloaded with brilliance and emotion.And while their screen time ranges from actively supporting to mere minutes, even the secondary roles, played by Paul Rudd as ""that teacher"" that some of us will remember and cherish forever , Kate Walsh (""Private Practice"") and Dylan McDermott (""American Horror Story"") as Charlie's parents, and Mae Whitman (""Parenthood"") as one of the wallflowers, add to the incredible emotional complexity, lending this film such an unobtrusive air of honesty and genuine feeling that to not be deeply moved by the story as it unfolds before you is practically inconceivable.If you have always been the pretty one with the perfect grades or the perfect job, the popularity, and attention focused on you, maybe you won't quite get it. But for the majority of us who have ever spent time wondering where the hell we fit in in this world, whether it be back in high school...or right now...keep the Kleenex close. If this film does not move you to your very foundation, make you think of where you have been, maybe where you are, or worry about what your kids might be silently going through, I don't know what else would.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is such an acutely executed film, it overflows with authenticity thanks to extraordinary performances by an almost implausibly perfect cast of young talent. If the AMPAS voters fail to take notice, it will be a shame, not just because nothing else hit the big screen this year like it and it deserves the extra recognition, but because an entire generation or two (or three) should take notice.Yes, it is THAT good. In a world where we need to assure our younger generation that ""it gets better,"" parents, teachers, wallflowers? Please, take notice. And grab the Kleenex. You've been warned.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Coming of Age director?,"Weird. I love coming of age films, but I thought this one was a self-conscious embarrassment, riddled with eye-rolling clichés, platitudes, and cartoon characters with no depth. In an apparent attempt at ""seriousness"", every troubling subject known to man was thrown in -- suicide, mental illness, sexual abuse of children -- but just thrown in, superficially, with no understanding or depth. Grossly sentimental. This feels like a coming of age film made by a coming of age director. There are many fine coming of age films that are authentic: Rob Reiner's Stand By Me, or Running on Empty, two wonderful examples. I cannot understand the overly high ratings of the viewers on IMDb for this one -- usually anything over 8.0 is a winner. I give it a generous 6 for a few good scenes and occasional good acting. Don't bother.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best teen dramas,"This movie impressed me in a way that I didn't really expect. Unfortunately I haven't read the book but I want to do it as soon as possible. From the first moments when Charlie started to write his letter I felt a strong empathy for him. I recognized myself in his way of seeing life, his fear of the others...and of the whole world actually. He made me remember my own fears from the time when I entered high school. I'm also a ""wallflower"". I'm the one who always keeps quiet, observes and understands facts. Logan Lerman's character made this movie so worth watching for me.I found myself even in his mental illness too, because, after all, it is a symbol of the ""ghosts"" which haunt each of us, the drama that lies behind our appearance. I think every teenager in this world should see this movie! It presents all the forms of anguish, anxiety, queerness and peculiarity that take over us. This story was made to show us that we're not alone! and that we're not some creepy aliens!I'm only 19 but at the end of the movie I felt so very old! It made me want to stop the time and remain there...at that moment when Charlie had finally touched the apogee of this adventure called adolescence!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
We accept the love we deserve,This is my first review and its brief. I do not understand the need for lengthy reviews. After watching this four times in six days i felt compelled to give my own ten pence worth. I've never seen a film like this where i have loved all the characters. The cast are brilliant and story moves along at a nice pace. The soundtrack is amazing. I love movies and its very rare that one comes along like this that works on so many levels. I am not usually one for this sort of genre and came close to taking this back before actually watching it. I am so glad i did not. Its going to be a very long time before something tops this. This is a feel good movie with some disturbing undertones. If you love movies and want something that moves you emotionally then this is for you.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Beautifully Made and Acted Movie,"A lot of people try to pin Perks as a coming of age movie. It is very much that, but it's also a whole lot more as well. A lot of its themes, such as how the friends who get us through tough times are to be treasured, translate to any age.Chbosky has very successfully translated his incredible novel onto the screen, preserving most of the critical elements loved by millions of fans. You can tell this movie was deeply personal for him, and it shows in his direction, locations and in his screenplay. Although Chbosky had limited directorial experience, I was impressed.This was truly an actor's movie, and the casting was perfect all the way through. I thought the three leads all did equally well in their respective roles. They were all amazing. Many seem to think Ezra Miller did the best of the three; while he perfectly brought the lively, charismatic Patrick to life, and played a perfect balance between being outgoing and reflecting some deep inward hurt, I didn't think his performance was any better than the other two. He actually had the easiest role to play. Logan Lerman was absolutely brilliant as Charlie, an extremely difficult part to do well. Logan perfectly captured the deep awkwardness, uncertainty and thoughtfulness of his character, as well as the emotions raging within him, from his tortured memories to his aching crush on Sam. As a viewer, you form a deep bond with him.I find it surprising that Emma Watson seems to get the least kudos. She had the most to prove, burdened with the doubts about acting ability (fair or not) that seem to go to actors from blockbuster franchises. There should be no more questions about whether she can act outside of Potter, as she did Sam spot on. I thought Sam was the most enigmatic character in the book, and Emma wonderfully captured all the deep nuances of her character. Just from her facial expressions and presence alone she hinted at Sam's internal conflicts and self doubts, and is believable as the girl Charlie would fall heavily for. All the cast seemed realistic as close friends, and there was some great on-screen chemistry , particularly between Emma and Logan, that will at times bring on the tears.Regardless of your age, there's something here for everyone. It's just a plain good movie. The amazing thing is that Emma Watson apparently had to go from studio to studio begging for a few dollars to get this amazing book made into a movie. Even after turning out extremely well, it is still playing in far fewer theaters than some of the less than stellar ""mainstream"" Hollywood offerings.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Prepare yourself for a extraordinary movie experience,"Has there ever been a moment in life when you look back at your high school life and reminisce on old memories whether they were good, bad, or embarrassing? I know I have. I guess that's how I felt this way about trying to survive high school and to find our hopes and dreams about who we'll be when we grow up, much like Charlie in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". I recently read the book and I can definitely relate to most of the situations that Charlie went through as well as anyone who has read it and seeing that the film has come to life thanks to Stephen Chbosky (the author of the book, as well the screenwriter and director), he discovers the human heart, the first chances you have in life and a chance to break away from all the pain, whether if you're an outcast or a popular kid. Set in Pittsburgh in the early 90's, both the movie and the book does follow Charlie (Logan Lerman), a 15-year-old kid starting high school for the first time. He is terrified about it after the loss of his two favorite people years ago and before high school started. Feeling lonely, depressed and ostracized by his peers in high school, he makes friends with Patrick (We Need to Talk About Kevin's Ezra Miller), the gay wild child and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson, in her first major role outside the Harry Potter series) who welcomes Charlie into ""The Island of Misfit Toys"" and tells him that it's okay to be himself. As the movie goes on as well as the book, Charlie happens to write to his unnamed friend about his first experiences while hanging with his new friends, having a crush on a certain someone, getting some help from his English teacher, Bill (Paul Rudd) and gaining some perspective from his family, including his sister Candace (Nina Dobrev). But he has a dark secret that could possibly haunt him forever. It's amazing to me that ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is one of those rare movies that gets the tone, feel and look right. Chbosky does a great job of streamlining his 213-page book into a 103-minute movie, editing out certain moments but remains faithful to the story. And if you're a true fan of the book, some of the moments from Charlie's point of view, including the tunnel and Rocky Horror scenes are beautifully re-created on screen. And if you love the music in the book, one of the songs from the book (""Asleep"" by The Smiths) is actually in the movie, so, find a chance to listen closely when you see it. The performances in the movie are amazing. They felt very real to me. If you look at this movie and tell us that the performances are not real to you, you need to have your head examined. These would be people I would've loved to hang out with in high school. Lerman is remarkable as Charlie, experiencing a lot of joy and emotions in many ways, including a heartbreaking scene that's reminiscent of Timothy Hutton in ""Ordinary People"". Miller steals every scene he's in and he brings humor and heart to a kid who likes being who he is, but has a few wounds that needs to be healed. And for Emma Watson? Oh, yeah, she captures Sam beautifully in a way that people will understand that she is no longer Hermione Granger. She also carries a very good American accent and it's an incredible performance. This is one of the best films I've seen so far this year. It's a high-spirited drama that's funny as hell, enchanting, heartwrenching and breathtaking. Not to mention that it carries a lot of reality of what high school life is like and how you can just live in the moment when you get a chance. It captures all of that brilliantly. See it to believe it and spread the word, this is a movie that you won't forget. Prepare yourself for unwavering emotions, hilarious humor and a chance of finding hope with ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", a true American teenage classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming Gem of a Picture,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012)*** 1/2 (out of 4)High school freshman Charlie (Logan Lerman) is having problems making friends but that all changes when he meets Sam (Emma Watson), Patrick (Ezra Miller) and their group. Soon Charlie finds himself experiencing all sorts of new adventures but the past is still there to haunt him as he tries to make sense of his world. This is based on Stephen Chbosky's best-selling novel and it's a rare case where the writer also gets to not only do the film's screenplay but also direct. I will admit right up front that I've never read the book and I never even heard of it until I saw the trailer for this movie. After viewing this film it really makes me want to read it because as a film this thing is actually very touching and rings very true to life. I thought the three leading characters were some of the best written and most memorable to come out of a teen film in a very long time and thankfully the screenplay pays just as much attention to the supporting characters like their friends to even Charlie's parents. The screenplay here is certainly one of the best of the year and I really liked how it could be dramatic one moment, sad the next and then funny all in the matter of seconds. I think this is why it rings true to real life and it also doesn't help that you get so many memorable performances. The three leads are certainly terrific with Watson coming off the best as the charmer. A lot of credit also has to go to Lerman for being able to handle such a wide range of emotions. Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott, Kate Walsh and Joan Cusack all do great in their smaller roles as well. Horror fans will also get a kick out of seeing Tom Savini in his role as a shop teacher. THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER is certainly a clever, smart and well rounded picture that works on many levels. I can't say if it's better or worse than the book since I haven't read it but this film is clearly a winner.",,Anonymous,Romance
Young Cast has Heart,"Charlie Kelmeckis (Logan Lerman) is a loner high school freshman with dark secrets. Luckily, unusual seniors Sam (Emma Watson) and her gay stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller) adopt him into their circle of friends. Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) takes a liking to him and English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) takes an interest in his work.The group of friends have amazing chemistry. They give a sense of true friendship off-camera, and it shows on camera. The only minor observation is that Logan Lerman seems a little too old to play a High School freshman. He is suppose to be 3 years younger than the rest. Logan Lerman gives a great performance but sometimes it's harder to see him as that much younger. Emma Watson also gives a credible performance as a sweetheart, but she's missing the damaged core that the story implies. Ezra Miller has wonderful charisma.First time director Stephen Chbosky adapts his own book to the big screen. He does a surprisingly good job for a rookie. But at times, he seems to miss the big moments. Charlie suffers from blackouts, and sometimes the movie suffers from the same. Songs often ends abruptly, and some scenes are missing its big payoffs. There's a scene where the boys grab him into the bathroom, but he doesn't show any consequences. I get the sense that a more experienced director would be able to see the missing bits. Charlie goes nuts in a fight but the movie holds back the big money shots. The movie has really dark places to go. The tone starts off as a charming, cute coming of age movie. I think a brutal scene early on would set the movie off in a darker direction. If it wants to go there, it needs to start earlier. Overall, it's a heart breaker and a good effort for the first time director. The young cast gives an exceptional performance.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Smooth and Deep,"Skeptical, critical, reflective, profound, subtle, jovial, there are several adjectives that can identify this film. We follow the story of Charlie an extremely shy, friendless young man with apparent psychological problems who has to deal with the adversity of being a freshman in high school. We quickly meet Sam and Patrick, two brothers who start to positively change the life of our main character. What seems to be more of a teen comedy, becomes, in fact, a film with problematic and deep themes and characters.

Emma Watson clearly has potential and put in a good shift.

Very good,"I went into watching 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' without reading the book 1st so I didn't know what sort of story to expect. The rating of the film was high but I was still a bit skeptical as to whether I would actually enjoy this, I'm glad to say I did like this film.The story is well written and the acting is very impressive. Logan Lerman as Charlie was the main character, he had some problems and he played his role very well, he seemed like a completely believable character who you really feel for. The rest of the cast were also good, especially Emma Watson. Having seen a lot of her in the Harry Potter movies, this was the 1st time I've seen her in anything else. She made the change with ease and her American accent was believable I thought, she really did show just how good of an actress she is.It has a serious side to it and some of the flashbacks are a little uncomfortable to watch. The way the friendships are developing is realistic and quite heartwarming. You really feel attached to the characters and maybe can relate a little to them, they are all extremely likable in their own way. I also liked the soundtrack for the film.Overall it's a very enjoyable film that I would recommend to anyone who wants a good drama.8/10.",,Anonymous,Romance

Hits home and then some,"Stephen Chbosky's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" may not be an original film dealing with high school ups and downs, but it could very well be a very strong addition to the genre. It marks a great directorial debut from Chbosky, who also wrote the screenplay which is based on his own novel. It is always a pleasure to see an author/novelist have the freedom to express his own material in a different medium, and do it so professionally.The film centers around introvert Charlie and his struggles during freshman year in high school. Charlie is struggling with making new friends due to personal tragedies which affected him negatively. This may not be new, but in the hands of a lesser director, could make it worse. Chbosky knows what he is doing and fine-tunes his actors to fit his story the way he wants it - raw and real. True to introverts, this movie and Chbosky really get what they're thinking and how they can cope with friends, bullies and tragedies. Chbosky understood the themes and his actors understood the material very well, so this film is not the usual teen film.The three main actors shape themselves around their characters perfectly. Logan Lerman is great as Charlie in a performance that is emotional, subtle, withdrawn and quirky in places. He really can get intense at moments too. Ezra Miller, who terrified us in ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" last year, turns 180 degrees and delivers a likable, hilarious, often touching character in Patrick, who is half the key to Charlie's quest for friendship. The other half is the lovely Emma Watson as Sam, Patrick's stepsister and Charlie's first love. Watson, in her first attempt to shed off her ""Harry Potter"" image is witty, charming and cute, and still manages to give out a heartfelt performance. She's the kind of pretty girl that all boys like to see, and give guys like Charlie hopes and dreams - and possibly save them, too. Other actors in the movie of note are Mae Whitman as Charlie's first date, Kate Walsh and Dylan McDermott as Charlie's parents and Nina Dobrev and Zane Holtz as Charlie's siblings. They sort of fade into the background once Charlie gets with his friends, but they're there when Charlie has no one, like all families should be. Oh, and Paul Rudd as the likable literature teacher. Makes you want him to be in your class one day.Chbosky does not stray from the roots of realism. Even though the film may tread familiar teen movie ground as desirable as it should, Chbosky firmly plants this movie's feet into the realistic ground. This film struck a personal chord with me, too. It really touched me as I am an introvert as well since high school, although not as serious and intense as Charlie, I feel him. Some scenes were pleasant to watch, some scenes were intense and brought back many unwanted/awkward memories, and other times it had me thinking even further.The fact that this film contains mature themes of suicide, homosexuality, drug and sexual content, and still be given a PG-13 rating is nothing short of a miracle. Bottom line is, if you're a teen or an introverted young adult, make sure this movie is on the top of your watch list. This is a great teen film.Overall: 84%",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Too Cute to Be a Wallflower,"This film is full of attractive young actors portraying high school kids, seemingly from affluent families based on their ""secret Santa"" gifts. Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, is a freshman with a great deal of sadness in his life because he had a favorite aunt, played by Melanie Lynsky, whose life was a tragedy; and a best friend who committed suicide.In fact, Charlie, while intelligent and loved by his family, seemed to be oddly normal for a kid with such a long history of mental problems, for example, ""seeing people."" I was confused as to why Charlie's sister, Candace, snubbed Charlie at school knowing how lonely he was, as compared to how loving and concerned she was at home. Also, the relationship between Sam and Patrick was not believable. How likely is it that two step-siblings would be equally quirky, empathetic, the same age, equally fashionable, compatible, and hang out together? Ezra Miller was amazing, and had too little screen time. In fact, I found myself unsympathetic to any of the characters because, other than Charlie and Patrick, all those kids seemed to have a good time all the time. The character of Mary Elizabeth just seemed like a different version of Sam, because the actresses playing those characters favor each other enough to be related.The script seemed very dis-jointed, as if the writer didn't want to delve too deeply into any one subject. The flashbacks to Aunt Helen were distracting, and the little boy actor who played little Charlie wasn't as cute as the grown up Charlie. The parents all seemed very uninvolved with their kids, and didn't seem to have a purpose. The film did explore the issue of being a gay male teenager and being betrayed by the poser, but only briefly.It seems like the theme of misfits finding each other has been done before and has been done better. And one lingering question I have is, if Charlie had been in therapy all those years, why did he only remember repressed memories when he entered his first year of high school? and then, why did he race for a kitchen knife the first time he's left alone at home, and if he's that unstable, why wasn't he locked up? It just seems like the writers thought they would just throw mud at a wall and see what sticks, but nothing too deep. And that whole issue about what song was playing as they drove through the tunnel drove me crazy.Lightly entertaining. Great performances by Ezra Miller and Logan Lerman. Joan Cusack's 3 minutes of screen time was reassuring.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Inifintely Amazing!,"I originally heard about the existence of ""Perks"" from news articles stating that Emma Watson would be in the movie (I'm a huge Harry Potter fan!) I read some of the book summaries and thought it sounded interesting, so I decided to read the book. I absolutely fell in love with it! Ever since, I had been wanting to see the movie, and had been upset at finding out it wasn't coming out near me in September. Finally, this past Friday it came out by me, so on Saturday a couple friends and I went to go see it. Overall, it was an incredible movie. They did leave out certain aspects from the book, but they were mostly parts that I could take or leave anyway. They kept the main parts in, as well as all of the best lines, which I greatly appreciated. The ending almost made me cry; it's just so powerful seeing these things I've read about come to life. Logan, Emma, and Ezra were amazing, as well as the supporting cast. Emma's accent was somewhat detectable in certain parts, but even so she portrayed Sam so well. And Ezra was by far the perfect Patrick, flamboyant, loud, and proud of it. Logan put so much emotion and heart into Charlie that I just wanted to reach through the screen and hug him. He truly was great. Anyone who loves the book as much as me will not be disappointed with the movie. In fact, if you're like me, you will want to see it again the second the credits roll! I know one thing's for sure, as soon as ""Perks"" comes on DVD, this girl is snatching a copy quicker than you can say ""Slut and the Falcon""!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012) - We are Infinite!,"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is definitely a movie that almost every teen and adult can relate to. It can bring back the beloved and nostalgic teen-hood memories of an adult, and while at the same time, showing a realistic tale of the every-day life of a teenager in high school to those who can understand the hardships of being a teen. ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is definitely one of the best movies of the year. Logan Lerman, from ""Percy Jackson"" fame, delivers one of this year's most fantastic performances as Charlie, a shy and nervous young teen, with dreams of being a writer, while not having the greatest childhood, who's about to start his first day of high school. He sees himself as an outcast from the other kids, and he's afraid to make any friends, until he meets and befriends two seniors, Sam and Patrick, played respectively by Emma Watson of ""Harry Potter"" fame, and Ezra Miller of ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" fame. They accept Charlie as one of their own, and ask him to join their group of ""misfit toys"". We now get a heartwarming tale of teen-hood, friendship, surviving through high school, living your life, and growing up in this wonderful coming-of-age teen drama. Based on a critically acclaimed novel of the same name, the book's author, Stephen Chbosky, has both written and directed a film adaptation of his own novel, and it just pulls off beautifully. You can tell that all the hard work has to be credited towards the director. It was his responsibility that the movie just has a great look and style, and it has a great realistic tone, while it never falls to being dull. Delivering one of the best scripts in recent memory, this movie is just filled with clever and witty dialouge, while at the same time, giving the audience some intense realistic moments, some that can make you laugh, or some that can make you cry. Thanks to the hard work of the writer, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" never feels as just a simple movie, while rather feels more like a realistic and truthful portrayal of teen life and behavior. As for the performances, all three young actors: Lerman, Watson, and Miller all delivering a fantastic chemistry that just shines on screen, and each actor delivers a great performance one after the other. The gorgeous Emma Watson is great playing the down-to-earth character of Sam, while Ezra Miller delivers stand-out comic relief as Patrick, the incredibly neurotic and charismatic step-brother to Sam. But, it's Logan Lerman who deserves a Best Actor nomination, for his performance as Charlie. As we learn in the film, he hasn't had a great childhood, from not communicating a lot with his family, and still trying to go through the death of a close relative. That makes Charlie seem the ultimate outcast at school. We actually feel the pain and hardships that the character goes through, and we as the audience, are always on his side, supporting him through the stages of his teen life. It's a golden performance that is truly one of the best I've seen all year. The unstoppable supporting cast also features some minor, but great performances from Paul Rudd as the English teacher with a heart of gold, and Melanie Lynskey, seen in flashbacks, as Charlie's deceased relative. This is a film that everybody, in almost every age, from adolescence to adult-hood, can find something to relate to. This is a film that will show audiences a beautiful coming-of-age tale of being yourself, staying with your friends, and trying to live in the world around us. Seeming perfectly similar to a John Hughes film, from ""The Breakfast Club"" to ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"", ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a truly original and realistic teen flick that audiences all over will enjoy for sure! ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", in my review, ""A beautifully original, and truly remarkable coming-of-age tale of adolescence"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A nostalgic, emotional crowd-pleaser for anyone who's gone to high school or ever felt alone","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" will be a relevant book for a long time, and consequently there's nothing dated about Stephen Chbosky's unique coming-of-age story now that it has finally hit the big screen so many years later. Anchored by strong performances from its leads and a powerful sense of poignancy, ""Wallflower"" is a thoroughly meaningful and enjoyable film.To come clean I've never read the book, but when an author tackles his own work as both writer and director, it can sometimes spell disaster. When adapting their own work, the creators of original source material either fail or succeed beautifully; either they can't do what needs to be done to their baby in order to make it suitable for film or they completely understand how to translate their work. Chbosky appears to have hit upon the latter.As a director, Chbosky's strength is capturing the nostalgia of his story, the emotions in particular from the unadulterated mirth to the sad, sad loneliness. With such talented blooming actors at his disposal, the film becomes all about them and we can't help but identify with them.The world of ""Wallflower"" is stereotypical high school, but somehow, even though countless films do the same thing, ""Perks"" feels authentic. Maybe its the setting of Pittsburgh, the king of blue-collar cities, along with the early '90s setting. Regardless of when you went through this phase of your life, there's something so identifiable in the way this film presents it.Charlie (Logan Lerman) is one of those protagonists that we all identify with too, and that's ultimately what makes this story powerful. We all have times when we feel like we didn't fit in, when we were ignored, when we felt like no one noticed us. And because Charlie wants to have friends, he isn't afraid to put himself in situations to succeed socially, we like him a lot. He's not the kind of loner who spurns the world around him.We meet Charlie upon his first day of high school. It's rough to be a freshman and Charlie has no friends. None. Everyone he was friends with as a kid has spurned him in some way and his best friend took his own life the previous spring. He's afraid to do anything to stand out, to embrace what makes him special. Fortunately, he puts himself in position to meet Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson), two seniors who don't fall into any clique other than their self-described ""misfits"" label. They are sweet, genuine people (as characters and the actors playing them) and they embrace Charlie. We come to love them in a vicarious way, for reaching out to Charlie as we ourselves would like to.Another part of what makes ""Wallflower"" a great story is that while we identify so strongly with Charlie at first, we eventually come to learn more and more about him and to the point that we can't even truly imagine what it's like to be him. We both pity him and come to admire him all the more for having a strength we're not sure we could ever have.The bulk of the film showcases their adventures, along with Charlie's growing affection toward Sam and his relationship with other friends in their group. Every little scene evokes something keen, namely what we loved about being in high school. Drama and serious issues crop up too, but with them comes the implicit understanding that these were the problems we faced in high school and even if we would do things differently now, that's what we probably would've done then.Not enough praise can be given to the trio of Lerman, Miller and Watson for bringing those feelings to life. Lerman is brilliant when it comes to portraying Charlie's introversion and communicating the mess in his head that we don't fully comprehend until the end. He should drop the Percy Jackson act and find more indie projects.After seeing ""We Need to Talk About Kevin,"" I thought I would never like Miller, ever, and always associate him with that terrifying title role, but he nails the courageous and flamboyant gay best friend, embodying the stereotype and then subverting it. His line delivery cuts the tension at the most ideal moments and he's the most lovable part of the movie by far.Sam is the weakest of the main characters, the girl next door with a troubled past that likes all the wrong guys. We're given her very much as Charlie sees her or any lonely teenager with a crush on the one he thinks he'll never get sees her. Watson, however, does a nice job keeping Sam's fragility with her at all times. When she's happy, it's an emotional breakthrough, and we get more of a sense of her character on the inside in spite of what the script gives us.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" doesn't break ground ground from a cinematic or storytelling perspective, but it does what it does — chiefly appeal to the emotions — as good as any movie out there.~Steven CThanks for reading!

An Earnest And Emotional Coming Of Age Tale,"The movie is written and directed by Stephen Chbosky, the very same person who wrote the amazing book of which the film is an adaptation of. It's a unique situation, given that it's entirely his vision and artistic integrity no matter how many changes there are between the two mediums. Not that there's anything to complain about between the two; the movie surprised me in just how heartfelt and genuine it came across and while it (of course) wasn't as powerful as the book, it still ended up being the most earnest and emotional coming of age film I have ever seen.The beauty of it all is in just how well it captures the human state of becoming 'someone', no matter what we think we should be or what we're afraid of. In this case, it's more about what we're afraid of people learning about ourselves. In this case, our characters come from very dark, abused and broken places and somehow it manages to inspire and give hope to the audience.While this is not a movie for the faint of heart, nor is it for the general 'popcorn crowd', it is absolutely a quintessential film experience that should be shared by those who want to grow, learn, and most importantly, understand others.The film does a phenomenal job of capturing the positive and life defining influences of friends, literature, music and love. The cast could not have been better, although, I do feel like Emma Watson dropped the ball on having the inner turmoil that her character required. Something that may have been done better by someone with more acting experience but nevertheless I have no real complaints at all. The small roles by Paul Rudd, Tom Savini, Nicholas Braun, and Joan Cusack brought a tremendous amount of weight to the film; all were exquisite.Don't be afraid of anything!Do yourself a favor and get your hands on this quick read. Then see the film. You'll thank me later.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Dramatically Moving, Visually Beautiful.","The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, being a book before hand, had a lot of hype coming from all of it's fans' worldwide. I personally had read the book before hand. I had a small amount of doubt towards Logan Lerman knowing that the last starring role that I had seen him in, was Percy Jackson And The Olympians: The Lightning Thief, which was not as good as the book. But lets face it, the book is almost always better than the movie. Anyways, this case was different. The movie touched my heart, it made me feel like I was actually in high school with Charlie, Sam, and Patrick. As if i was reading the book all over again, Very pleased with the come out.

"Decent, but didn't give Alexander Rhodes enough screen time","Alexander Rhodes clearly added an entirely new dimension to the dynamics of the film; a depth which simply cannot be achieved without an actor of outlandish quality and soul-crushing maturity such as himself. His portrayal of his character was taken straight out of the Shakespearean tradition, and was executed with the precision of a seasoned actor. At times, there was semi-sloppy camera work, and the shading was detectably off, but this, of course, cannot be blamed on Mr. Rhodes. He cannot be held accountable for the incompetence of the directors and camera crew. It is outrageous that he didn't receive more screen time: he essentially made the entire film! All in all a very respectable film, but this was in all honesty a product of Mr. Rhodes' ability to connect with the viewer, locking us into a trance of awe and wonder.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"An imperfect but touching, thought-provoking film about discovery, sexuality, friendship and betrayal.","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a strange little film that will likely divide audiences before they even reach the cinema. Writer/director Stephen Chbosky has a ready-made audience from his source novel and has credibility as the creator of TV series Jericho, but as a director he has just one previous big screen outing: 1995's little seen The Four Corners of Nowhere. In front of the camera there is little in the way of star power though both male leads have some impressive films on their CVs: Logan Lerman has ably supported bigger names in the likes of 3:10 to Yuma and starred in Percy Jackson and the Lightening Thief while Ezra Miller positively chilled the world as the titular sociopath in We Need to Talk About Kevin.So it falls to the biggest name amongst the principal stars, Emma Watson, to woo the audiences. And therein lies the division. Watson has physically appeared on the big screen in nine films prior to this, eight of which were as Hermione Granger. If you've never watched a Harry Potter film, your only cinematic reference to date is a brief appearance in the fine My Week With Marilyn. If you're one of the countless millions who have watched the wizard series you'll either recall her acting ability evolved from 'not terribly good' to 'passable' or you're still under fourteen years of age.The first thirty minutes of The Perks of Being a Wallflower verge on arduous, largely due to Watson, playing Sam, the older woman to Lerman's Charlie. She tries so damn hard to act, to be noticed, to be American, to earn our respect but succeeds only in looking like a child who has raided her mum's wardrobe but is ten years too young to carry it off and ten years too old to still look cute. For thirty minutes I watched a film that barely warranted two stars and I groaned inwardly at the thought I chose this over Anna Karenina.Then something happened. Or rather, nothing in particular happened but Watson relaxed into Sam, The Perks of Being a Wallflower found its feet and I realized I was watching an imperfect but touching, thought-provoking film about discovery, sexuality, friendship and betrayal. And, shockingly, that Emma Watson has the makings of being a reasonably good actress. Once she relaxes, her performance is tender and Sam's desperation is palpable.Charlie is an introverted freshman with little self-confidence who writes letters to his only friend: a friend who committed suicide. Faced with the challenge of college, Charlie begins his first day with desperate hope for change and concludes it counting down the days until graduation. Life sucks, the bullies spot him a mile away and his only escape is through the books his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), inspires him with until he is adopted by a group of misfits in their final year headed by Sam and her stepbrother, Patrick (Miller).Miller stands out with a performance that is a world apart from Kevin. As Patrick he is a maelstrom of emotions in a fragile body that wears gregariousness like armour. He is judgmental, forgiving, joyful, depressed, delightful and as annoying as hell. Patrick is damaged goods. And that's why he and Sam are more than stepsiblings. And that's why Charlie fits right in. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a film for all of us who felt like we were on the outside trying desperately to make someone notice we were hammering on the door to be let in. It's also a film for all of those who were enjoying the party and decided to ignore the banging.The trailer implies a sweet, humorous college flick but it doesn't portray the various shades of darkness within the characters. Everyone has a side they turn away from the crowd and Chbosky, after a faltering start, rotates every character so the dark side faces the camera, if only fleetingly. He writes and directs like a chess player (no, not a grandmaster, but that may come) lulling us into a false sense of security with something sweet or cheerfully twee and then he kicks us hard, square in the balls and we gasp at this new revelation.For some viewers there are great twists and turns, but most will watch as the characters slowly unfurl and reveal more of what is hidden deep inside and not see each new disclosure as a shock but as another jigsaw piece to reveal the full picture.There were no tears, no huge lumps in my throat and too much damage was done in the first 30 minutes to elevate The Perks of Being a Wallflower above six stars but it is a good film, particularly after the event as the story remains very much in mind.I had intended to make it the first in a double bill with Sinister but such was the effect on me that I opted not to pollute my state of mind with something harsh and lacking in sensitivity, instead preferring a slow drive through dark country lanes home to a warm cottage to where I could let the story filter through in its own time.Another film review from The Squiss.Like the Facebook page: http://on.fb.me/RpitOG",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
disappointing,"As someone over 21, I feel like an interloper reviewing this film. It didn't reflect my teenage experience back to me, but I was well past that phase in the early nineties. And yet, the American high school, such a tired, over-familiar arena for American cinema, seems not to have moved on at all. Jocks, Jewish-American princesses, closet gays and geeks all populate this film in fairly conventional representations. The lead character is in a state of fragile mental health, but no Holden Caulfield. He finds friends, has a loving family, and a teacher who looks out for him. The main issue he has is historical abuse, but the rendering of this is so 'lite' as to be unrealistic and totally lacking in emotional impact. I can buy that they did not know a Bowie classic in this part of the world in the early nineties, but I can't accept that they would ostracise a clearly fragile friend after one drunken party faux pas. The film does not explore the fallout of childhood abuse in meaningful terms, and it fails to capture the pain and euphoria of being a teenager. All in all, a bit flat and disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
The most authentic depiction of high school ever put to film,"I was 17 when I first watched this. It quickly became one of my favourite films, but I could never explain why, it just... made sense to me. I'm now 26, and I feel that I can finally articulate why it continues to be amongst my most cherished films.In school, I was the indie kid who was passionate about filmmaking, who loved fine art and listened to 'old' music, but I often felt invisible. There were times where I had lots of friends and times where I had no friends. I often spent my lunch breaks alone reading books. I was a wallflower.To me, this is the most authentic depiction of school ever put to film. It perfectly captures the felling of isolation and the desire to be loved and included. This is in part due to it being so perfectly cast. So much care and detail is put into the performances, making the characters feel incredibly real. It doesn't have good guys or bad guys, it has people, like real people. Couple this with great dialog, elevated by the perfect soundtrack, this film made me laugh, smile, and cry as these characters struggle through complicated relationships and grow in response to the mistakes they make. There are no big romantic gestures, no dramatic makeovers, and no wild parties. Instead, the film's most dramatic moments are quiet, intimate, and honest, mirroring the reality of teenage life.The film also portrays PTSD in such a delicate, subtle, and tasteful way. I think this is the best depiction of teenage mental illness I've ever seen. It's not treated as a mystery or a big bomb shell to be dropped, but is instead simply part of the character which informs their actions.This film gave me the inspiration to take my back off the wall, and write my own story in life, because that's the power of storytelling. Sure, it can be a form of simple escapism, but it can also serve as inspiration, or validation of oneself. For kids like me, it's cathartic and empowering to be able to relate to an ensemble cast like this, and shows that by surrounding yourself with people who love you, and taking good care of yourself by confronting your problems, you too can feel infinite.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""He shot himself las may""","I was sitting on my couch in front of the TV. I scoured my saved movies list on various streaming services before I came across this one. I had put off watching this movie for some time because I never had a reason to watch it. This time however I didn't have a reason not to watch it, along with the fact that my food was getting cold. While I was watching the movie I kept thinking about how I would feel when it ended, because I really did not want it to. I went as far as to take a break in the middle of the move. To do dishes and clean up in the kitchen.After the was over I was stunned, and I sat there asking myself how I would move on from this movie. That thought led me to read what other people thought of the movie, which did not scratch the itch that this movie left. This combined with some inspiration from Charlie led me to where I am now, writing a review, for the first time. Simply put, I have never felt as much emotions from a movie as I did with this one. All kinds of emotions both good and bad. Good, in the form of feeling like I have been woke out of a deep emotional sleep. Bad, in the form of feeling a certain jealousy for the characters in the movie. My own life feels dull compared to theirs, but I guess that is to be expected when you compare a movie with real life.If you have already seen the movie and feel as I do, I hope this might have helped.

Not just a movie about a shy schoolboy,"I was interested in a movie about a shy schoolboy because I have been one myself. But I have to admit that the movie went well beyond that. The hero was not just shy but had other deeper problems originating in the relationship he had had when very young with- a now departed- relative. The people with whom he associated with, to act as mentors and to provide an initiatory experience to the real world, were in many aspects even more problematic than he was. The trailer is misleading because you expect a movie about shyness and social awkwardness and you get a movie about homosexuality, drugs and entrance to adulthood. The case-studies of the characters are too special to be typical. Nevertheless I keep the appearance of Emma Watson of whom I am a fan. Since I am neither British or American I can not tell the difference between a British and an American accent about which so much was made by some reviewers- I just found her English intelligible and that is enough for me.

The atmosphere and the acting from every single actor just makes this movie so so so amazing to watch- not only that, but it's a difficult watch (which i think makes it all the better.) Paul Rudd?? Adds so much to this movie? I loved the connection with charlie and english, i thought it was wonderful. It really hits close to home, and i think that this movie is art. It gives me that feeling in my chest that i get when i see wonderful, moving art that hits close to home. I need to read the book and get a full scope. It wasn't 10/10 for me because sometimes the lighting and darkness of the shooting makes it difficult to focus, but some would argue that adds to the movie and what it's truly about. So 🤷‍♀️ but i still absolutely love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
My favourite movie,"This movie is to me the single best of all I've seen. I feel so connected to the characters, and I would do anything to become friends with them. I also feel like I know how Charlie is feeling, and that feels so strange. I think I know more about myself after watching the movie than ever before.I've seen it a couple of times, and I'm always left crying. There's so many levels in this movie, which makes it feel new every time it's watched. I sometimes catch myself thinking about how it might have ended, because the ending is, to me, very open - in a good way. The only thing that I don't like about it, is that I saw the movie before reading the book, but that is of course my own fault.It sometimes feel like I like myself better after seeing this than before. I'm not done watching this over and over, and I might never be.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really nice,"When I saw that film first time I thought it's a cry-drama for girls but I decided to watch it anyway, and I absolutely sure this is awesome film. Now it's one of my favourite, I really liked it and advise you to watch.There is all I need in this film: nice story, love drama (not for girl), the acting, music, and emotions.

Wallflowered,"I really love the idea of this movie. Exploring the psyche of an introverted young man trying to navigate the social minefield of high school while struggling with his own baggage seems like a near timeless subject.It just didn't quite click fully for me. There's a plot movement at one point that I feel isn't entirely necessary to still have a compelling story but it was effective.This likely just needs another watch, maybe I was in the wrong headpiece or something. Problem is, this movie is a downer, so can't say I'm going to race to queue it up again. Still, whether I love it or not, I absolutely think this is worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Teen Film,"This is the story of Charlie (Logan Lerman)--a teen who is an introvert--as he begins his high school career. Charlie meets a couple of seniors who take him under their wing. They are all misfits, outliers in the social order, but they support each other. The film does a good job of portraying the feeling that every teen exists on an existential edge, where circumstances can threaten well-being and mental health at any time.As with other teen films, these high schoolers sometimes seem too sophisticated for their age and experience. But that is a minor issue.Emma Watson plays the part of Sam, the girl that Charlie falls for so easily. She is like an angel in his world of disappointment and malaise. Her performance is pivotal to the story, and it feels believable.The adults are played by excellent actors, but most of them are underused.This is a coming of age story that feels like just a chapter in a longer book, but it is satisfying nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Good, but mildly disturbing.","On my first watch of this movie, I was barely paying attention and assumed the main protagonist, Charlie, was actually a malicious guy that only realized his trauma toward the end of the movie. Charlie wasn't malicious at all. He was just a freshman hanging around a new group of people and experiencing a whole new world. When things sarted going a direction different than he expected, he of course didn't know how to properly navigate it despite him trying to make it work out as best he could.Rewatching this film, I learned about his background, origin, and true intentions with this group of friends, The Wallflowers. Charlie is a good kid trying his best to have a normal life after experiencing things that can make such a simple thing as existing, a living hell. And this friend group consists of genuine characters with grand personalities and good hearts. But, I also noticed there are themes in this movie that are predominately frowned upon where I come from, such as seniors having romantic relationships with freshmen that turned into a college student having a romantic relationship with a high schooler. And a theater that hires highschooler to perform in revealing clothing sexual themes. It appears to be normalized in this film, however, so it's not unlikely that it's normalized in other parts of the country as well. Besides that and the other intentionally serious themes, I think this was a very fine movie. I sympathized with the characters physically; I could feel the distress they've gone through. I can see why certain parents wouldn't allow their child to watch this but I think it's a good film to gain perspective on the lives of others and what we as people may go through.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disingenuous,"Movies like this are a disservice to real life kids in actual high school today. No manic pixie dream girl (and her inclusive sidekick) really exist, certainly not in high school, and no unsuspecting nerd is going to be swept up into a whirlwind of acceptance and parties and love affairs. If this movie weren't about something people everywhere, throughout all time, ever didn't experience for themselves, maybe it would be entertaining. But they do. So it's just insultingly saccharine. This movie should be categorized under fantasy, it's certainly not relatable for kids, I think it only really serves as a guidebook for the MPDG wannabe's. IE: it's tripe. Thank goodness I didn't see this while I was actually in high school and actually struggling or this would have made me feel worse.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Thought I'd hate it, but it's great","Sometimes it's good to pick a movie you think you'll dread. That's what I thought when reading the plot summary for this wonderfully quirky brilliant film. I so enjoyed the interaction of the main characters, the accurate but not trite study of high schoolers, and the fine performances. I didn't read the book, but how could it be better than the movie? That's hard to imagine! I was totally blown away by the ending, too. That's a really surprising treat after watching the rest of the fine story unfold. This movie deserves to be more well known. It pleasantly throws you for a loop while also making you think so many of the characters are actually people you've met in your own life!!! Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A mature and timeless take on the problems we all go through, a heartfelt portrayal of how a young person can recover from traumatic events and move on","In his desire to make a portrait of youth, Chbosky delivers a film that unites drama and comedy like few others. The harmony between these two genres is in each scene, in each moment of fun and introspection of its characters. If your conversations seem too grown-up, a little banter later gives your ages away. Chbosky's direction, however, leaves the script with a playful tone and opts for a cadenced rhythm that values silence and the sensations experienced. ""The Perks of Being Invisible"" is a film with a huge heart, one of those that beat beyond the dark room. The director also surprises by adopting a subjective focus on Charlie, he manages to transport us inside his protagonist. When he is alone, we feel alone, when he is surrounded by friends, we feel in the warmth of this social circle.It's impressive how Chbosky's script manages to portray Charlie's instability, situations that are common to all of us, but there's such sincerity in what we watch that we can't help but become transfixed on the screen. At the same time, he deals with the character's depression in a frighteningly realistic way and gradually reveals more of the causes of the disease, bringing a harrowing plot twist that takes the feature film out of the ordinary and places it far above average. The issues addressed are a shock of reality and the way they are portrayed make this a work that deserves and should be watched by any teenager - even drug use, first shown with its good side effects, shows its harm later in the projection.Even his anguish, shyness (like when he's about to dance or kiss someone) we bring to ourselves and we can't help but remember our own experiences, which made high school a true wonder for some and for others an indescribable torture. The beauty of ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is there, in its eternal character - no matter what decade we live in, we will always go through similar situations, because, despite technological and philosophical changes, human beings will continue to be what they are: a mixture of uncertainties, emotions, feelings that can generate truly wonderful things and terrible things... How not to get emotional in the tunnel scene? How not to be embarrassed when Charlie ""flickers"" in the game of truth or dare? How not to smile when he kisses you for the first time? Looking like a filmmaker from a huge filmography, Stephen Chbosky is completely sure of what he should show and how he should do it. There are no mishaps in this nearly year-long story. The supporting characters are few and many well defended, without any stereotype. And what about the beautiful romance between Charlie and Sam?""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" stands out for reporting the high school experience from the point of view of the most displaced student possible, with internal problems that go beyond the mere desire to be popular. This is what makes the story different from so many others that portray everyday school life, because while they have popularity as the protagonist's focus and objective, Chbosky's narrative explores the root of the insecurities that make him antisocial and generate unpopularity. The issue surrounding most of Charlie's trauma is his sexuality. Throughout history and his romantic involvements - with Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) and Sam - we see that the boy has difficulties in feeling comfortable in intimate moments with them.In addition, Charlie took a passive position in front of his own life, especially with regard to these relationships. This happens throughout the drama when the protagonist does not declare his feelings for Sam, and during the dull months of his relationship with Mary Elizabeth, when he cannot bring himself to break up with her until he takes a nervous and hasty attitude. In the book, traces of this can also be seen in his friendship with Patrick during the period in which his friend suffered from a broken heart, a subplot that brings even more emotion and representation to The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Taken by need, the boy kissed Charlie, who never complained about the act, even confessing in his letters that he felt uncomfortable with the situation. At the end of the plot, it is explained that this blockage of the character is due to the sexual abuse he suffered from his aunt Helen (Melanie Lynskey). The feature does not bring the explanation explicitly, but treats the subject with subtlety, implying that some of his touches on Charlie's leg were the same as the girls did to him. The almost careful way in which the film makes viewers perceive what happened contrasts with the new outbreak of the protagonist, who cried and had hallucinations.The influence of interpersonal relationships on Charlie's psychological framework is very clear in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". In fact, the boy can only remain stable when he maintains a healthy relationship with his friends. In parallel with real life, this relationship is common and raises questions about the extent to which this is a pillar of emotional health, and where it turns into dependence. Charlie's passivity towards other people, in addition to his traumas, also came from the fear of displeasing them. He put the happiness and lives of others ahead of his own, and although it seems like a noble gesture, it was detrimental to him. As a reflection of this dependency, in the weeks that passed after the group of friends left for college, the boy deteriorated significantly and was hospitalized. However, this time, he was willing to face his problems and collaborate with the therapy. With the support of his family and the regular visits of his friends, the protagonist recovers and continues his treatment outside the hospital. During this period, with psychological help, receiving support and being surer of himself, Charlie proposes to be more present in the now and, for the first time, recognizes himself as ""not being a sad story"". The final scene of Sam, Charlie and Patrick in the tunnel closes this change, as it shows that he finally accepted himself as he was and, more than that, recognized himself as worthy of the love of his friends. In the end, this is what it means to feel infinite.Set in the early 1990s, the feature also succeeds in recreating the era, whether in the costumes and haircuts of the characters, even in the absence of cell phones and the constant presence of extinct cassette players (something anyone born in that era is capable of not even knowing what it is). Even the reference to the technology of the time is extremely important in the feature. In one of the scenes, the trio of friends listen to ""Heroes"" in the car, music that is not recognized by any of the three and that generates the beginning and triggering of a passion. The soundtrack, by the way, is another great highlight. Eighties rock takes over, either through Sonic Youth, The Smiths, among others. The musical taste here is seen as a form of union (and sometimes feud) of people outside the usual environment of a school. The Displaced, as Charlie's group of friends call themselves, seeks to further legitimize this nickname by promoting the adaptation of one of the strangest, funniest musicals and symbol of the so-called ""alternative"" of the 1970s: The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975).If there is one great asset to this film, it is the beautiful story of innocent love felt and little shared between these two characters. And it works because of a well-written script that deepens Charlie's personality and makes Sam more than lovable, as well as delicate performances by the two actors. Logan Lerman contributes the charisma and sobriety that had already made him stand out in ""Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief"". The actor is the one who has the greatest responsibility: he must live a mixture of sadness, joy, anger, passion and regret, while captivating the spectator and in this regard, he succeeds in a way that anyone who has gone through something similar will applaud the boy. Emma Watson, on the other hand, comes with the beauty and sympathy that Chbosky emphasizes from the first take of the actress, who carries a huge emotional dose, experiencing the uncertainty of her character, is a woman whose future is about to be decided and that makes her unable to cope with other aspects of her life right - even though she puts Charlie in a terrible position, we can't help but grow fond of Sam and understand his side, such is Emma's sincerity in her work.The chemistry, however, does not just happen between the couple. Ezra Miller complements this inseparable trio with teases, confessions and fun. His is the most tragic and most adult character. Wisely, Chbosky uses the character to address the issue of homosexuality in a society that is still very prejudiced and practically shouts to the viewer: be yourself, don't hide, showing that the arduous task of revealing yourself can take a weight off your shoulders. Mae Whitman adds a low-key humor that finds reason to laugh in the hilarious rut of an unrequited love affair just in its infancy. Paul Rudd also makes a pivotal appearance as Charlie's literature teacher, Mr. Anderson, someone who contributes to his student's personal and professional development, as well as several references left by the script (notice the books given by the teacher to the boy).For all its strengths, the film still falls into the small slippage normal for book adaptations that follow a diary or letter structure. By bringing a constant off-screen narration, we often have a simple observation of facts that we already see on screen, which ends up taking away the dramatic effect of some excerpts. Fortunately, here, the case is milder than in ""The Fault in Our Stars"", for example, but it still undermines the feature in certain respects. That said, the film is a mature and timeless take on the problems we all go through, a heartfelt portrayal of how a young person can recover from traumatic events and move on.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Wallflower Full of Emotions,"Tackling serious family difficulties along with the struggles of school life, Perks of Being a Wallflower (adapted from Stephen Chbosky's novel) is a romantic illustration of how even the lowest points in life can have their glimmers of hope.Charlie, a 15-year-old introvert, enters high school and is nervous about his new life. When he befriends his seniors, he learns to cope with his friend's suicide and his tumultuous past.The film (much like the book) is an embodiment of the breaking of dichotomies in society particularly within the younger generations, placing emphasis on the pressure and strain our youth are under in recent times - ultimately in its celebration of diversity. Focusing on mental health and well-being, Perks of Being a Wallflower encapsulates the raw emotions involved in anxiety and depression, symbolising the importance of help and seeking support throughout its core narrative; author of the novel Chbosky also impressively directed the film, enabling the picture to carry a personal tone and the storyline to be portrayed exactly as it was intended.Logan Lerman and Emma Watson steal the show with powerful acting displays allowing these mental thoughts and feelings to be transferred from the page to the screen. Although the movie is fashioned to reflect a primarily solemn note, it does feature welcome quirks and short-lined humour to compliment the foundations of the script.Both heart-warming and heart-rending - presented with care.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"The film ""The perks of Being a Wallflower"" is based on the same titled novel by Author and director Stephen Chbosky. It follows Charlie (Logan Lerman), a sixteen-year boy, through his first year of high school where he makes friends, finds love and grows up. There he befriends the Stepsiblings Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller), with whom he spends the majority of his time. Charlie is a very self-conscious and inexperienced teenage boy with just a few friends. To change this, he decides to befriend Sam and Patrick, who gladly accept him into their circle of friends. With his new friend group, Charlie has his first experiences with alcohol, drugs, love, and a variety of other things. Over the time he develops feelings for Sam, but decides not to act on them, because their friendship is too important to him, and he sees Sam as more mature and experienced than he is.What I like about the film is, how close to the reality, but also the novel it is. A lot of the scenes are directly adapted from the Novel, but I feel like a few very important things, that show Charlies character, are missing in the novel. For example, his ""relationship"" to Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd). My favourite scene has to be of course the Tunnel scenes but I also really like, how the pictured the rocky horror picture show.Most of the characters are how I imagined them reading the novel, like Patrick or Sam. Although most characters were casted great, I think they could have done a better job casting Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman). I still loved the character, but the actress didn't fit the role in my opinion.In conclusion, I think the movie is really good, but after reading the novel it was a tiny bit disappointing. I still would recommend watching it, even though I would recommend reading the novel first, because it helps understand some of the scenes.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not the Teen Dramedy I Had Hoped For,","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a decent movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a talented cast. The highlight of the film is certainly the chemistry between Emma Watson and Ezra Miller, the back and forth between them was phenomenal, and looked absolutely effortless.However, I did find that the film was falsely advertised as being a feel good teen comedy drama that it made me go in to it expecting something else. In reality, it is a very bleak film that teaches bad lessons about your teen life and paints a very pessimistic picture.As well as that, if I am being honest, I found Lerman very uneffective in the lead role, Charlie was a very bland character that he did not bring much to make him more intriguing, this suffered especially when Sam and Patrick are far more interesting, but we do not get to see them half as much.Has its moments, but was not for me.

Hit me hard,"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" follows Logan Lerman's character, Charlie, a new freshman in high school who experiences bouts of depression and potential PTSD. Logan feels hopeless, expressing his worries in letters written to an anonymous pen pal. He thinks his life can only get worse, until he meets Patrick and Sam. Played by Ezra Miller and Emma Watson respectively, Patrick and Sam take Charlie out of his comfort zone, introducing him to the beautiful world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll.aThis is a film that won't resonate with everyone. I imagine some would be turned off by the occasionally over-literary dialogue, for example. And while the dialogue did take some getting used to, as I found it more akin to something spoken in a play than a film, once I got past that, I journeyed through an emotional adventure that had me laughing, smiling, and crying throughout. Also, there is an overwhelming amount of teen angst present throughout the movie, and a decisively ""emo"" tone that is steeped in practically every scene. However, those who don't mind, and even kind of enjoy those things, will be treated to a story that is a pure joy to watch unfold on film.This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and one that I can say I genuinely enjoyed so much that I did not want it to end. I have a sweet spot for coming of age films, so I kind of expected to like this movie when I popped it in the player - what I didn't expect was to feel so connected to each character and situation depicted on screen. The movie does a great job of slowly introducing you to its world and characters, building up a real connection between you and them - practically every character is so inherently likeable that you'll literally feel like you, too, could be friends with them.Throughout the undercurrent of teenage anxiety, there is a very sweet romance at play here, specifically between Sam and Charlie - their budding love is so charming and heartwarming to watch, and they have many scenes together where you can just feel their feelings for one another, even when no words are being spoken - the truth or dare scene, specifically, sticks out as a sequence that took my breath away in its subtle beauty, and in its context and impact that it would have on the overall story. Additionally, Ezra Miller's character shines in a show-stealing performance as a gay student who is navigating a secret relationship, and all of the turmoil that comes with not feeling able to freely express who he is. It can be a painful role to watch, but it's one that Ezra makes his own with fantastic humor and infectious charisma. And whenever Ezra, Emma, and Logan are on screen together? It's a trio for the ages.Ezra, Emma, and Logan have such fantastic chemistry that I'll be surprised if they aren't good friends to this day after having made this movie together. They are so believable as three high school students who are simply trying to figure their life out and find themselves in a world that seems to be against them at every given moment. You really want to see these characters succeed, and you'll actively hope for the best for them. Whether or not the best is what they get in the end is up to you to find out.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a gorgeous, emotionally resonant film that I felt a deep connection toward. Its characters, its story, the situations it portrays, everything tugged at my heart strings, slowing but surely making me fall in love with the entire world that the film set up, and by the end I was depressed, not because of what I watched, but because I knew the movie was coming to a close.

Infinitely Wonderful,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower centers around high school freshman Charlie becoming close with senior step-siblings Patrick and Sam.

Each gave an absolutely stellar performance. But, if I was to give a specific shoutout, Ezra Miller definitely takes the cake, showing the all too relatable struggle of closeted relationships.This film is set in 1991 which gives the film a fun grunge aesthetic. It also handles its heavy topics with lots of respect.The only reason I rated this film a 9 instead of a ten are:

"Uplifting teenage drama with humour, heart and soul","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is self-adapted from Steven Chbosky's novel of the same name. While I frequently like reading the novel first to gain more insight into the art of the adaptation, and also to read good books, I stayed clear from this one since it was written as a series of letters. The protagonist writes one letter after another and such works can seem choppy at best. As a film, letter writing can be a useful tool to understand the inner turmoil of characters and here Perks feels very fluid.Charlie (Logan Lerman) suffers from mental illness resulting from the death of his best friend and a childhood incident with his aunt that is purposely left ambiguous until the very end. Entering high school, Charlie is an outsider until he makes friends with Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller), examples of the titular ""Wallflower"". Sam is definitely too pretty and Patrick is likely too funny and charismatic to not be the most popular kids in school, but it really is a good movie, so we let that go.The best part (and I will eventually start sounding like a broken record if he keeps acting and I keep reviewing) went to Ezra Miller. First he gets his name changed to ""Nothing"" and then he takes our mentally- damaged hero under his wing and then his flamboyant homosexuality gets him in love and trouble. Lerman's Charlie might be the eyes to the movie but Miller's Patrick is the heart and soul and humour to everything that ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is.""Perks"" is a dramedy. Superficially, Patrick provides the comedy and Charlie and Sam provide the drama. But the movie works on both a superficial level and multiple layers deep. The quickest way to one's heart is generally through humour, so that's mostly how the movie starts. Patrick gets us laughing, and then Sam gets us falling in love and before we know it, we're emotionally invested in Charlie and realize that he is more disturbed than the rest of us outsiders are. The childhood incident with the aunt is one such instance that could remove us from Charlie but they only give us hints to what occurred up until the very end, and by then we're all best friends. The multiple layers works well with this incident. Those who dig deep into ambiguous hints can guess early on, while those who are visually adept at understanding the meaning that editing can add to a movie will figure it out next, while the rest will eventually be told. This is just one such example of using editing, flashbacks, and music to enliven all elements of the story.The dialogue can get a little too clever for the ages of the characters. I always get frustrated when teenage smart-alecks start philosophizing about what combination of religions best represent them. Mae Whitman is left to fend for herself as her character is described as ""a really nice person underneath the parts of her that hate everybody"". I only saw the hate. The rest of the main characters are all very lovely and are getting their deserved accolades.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a touching and dramatic people- pleaser. It appears to be a hit with all audiences. So much so, that my theatre shortened the name on the marquee to ""Being a Wall"" and the movie was still sold out.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It was great to see a movie that beautifully showed some of the struggles that real teenagers go through and not sugar coated.This movie is very emotional and has great acting. I like the way the flashback scenes are shown, by alternating from the present to the past, then showing the aftermath after the flashbacks. I had never seen Emma Watson in anything but the Harry Potter series, and she is amazing playing Sam, I have never seen her play a character like this.The movie is so good that no words can explain. I bought the book directly after I watched the movie. I also love how throughout the whole movie most of the story is told by Charlie (Logan Lerman) who writes letters anonymously to ""A Friend"" who doesn't exist.This movie is about a severely depressed and lonely boy, Charlie, whose best friend killed himself before the school year starts. So now, Charlie has no friends and people think he is weird because he holds in and takes the pain of himself and all of the people he loves, sometimes it all wells up and he has anxiety attacks. This year he is determined to make friends and he meets the flamboyant Patrick (Ezra Miller), and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson). They let him in and introduce him to a whole new world filled with fun, sadness, and just plain life. Plus, he falls in love with Sam along the way. All of Charlie's friends are seniors, and he makes a mistake that makes them go away for a while. But then he does something to make them love him even more than before.I think that everyone should watch this movie. I like how, whenever something bad or slightly inappropriate happens in the flashbacks, the scene hints at what was happening without blatantly showing what happened. My favorite quote from the movie is when Charlie's English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) tells him that, ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" I think it is so profound and absolutely true. I recommend this movie for eighth graders going into high school up to any adult. This movie can prepare teens to not keep emotions and experiences bottled up because school can be painful and stressful. I give it five out of five stars because this movie is amazing and will someday be a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
There are just two possible scenario for you to like this movie,"1) You are the author of the novel / writer of the screenplay / director of the film / real life teenage sufferer as described in the story. The events are your life, thus boring or not boring, you love to see them translated on the screen.2) You are a teenager yourself, going through a time which might be similar to the one experienced by any of the protagonists, so you feel yourself identified with their story.In any of the two previous cases, you probably think this movie is a masterpiece.If nothing of the above applies, you might think as I do: This is a movie with great performances, but the story is absolutely flat and extremely predictable with huge clichés as main characters. It feels they have used the same pattern as in any other ""coming of age story"". The only thing which is not that predictable (all the mental issues plot which I won't discuss here to keep this spoiler free) is very overlooked by the main story, and when it gets into it, it gets a treatment very in a rush, as if the writer didn't think it's so important.And by the way, the image of teenagers listening to ""The Smiths"" and stating how great taste in music they have, not listening to other mainstream garbage, is already a parody. In fact, when ""The Smiths"" name was said for the first time in this movie, I couldn't avoid laughing.I will stay away from upcoming coming of age stories, unless they prove to be more original and don't use so many clichés.And for the writers out there: Nobody cares about how much you suffered in high school... except people going through high school, so I guess you can understand how people outside high school is not very interested in what you have to say.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
My new official favorite movie,"For years, ""Big Fish"" has been my favorite movie. Others have come close, I even had to make a pro and con list when I saw ""The Sandlot"" again a while back to compare the two. But none have matched Big Fish. I have read the book for Perks of Being a Wallflower years ago, and fell in love with it. Naturally, when the movie was announced I was a bit skeptical but when i Learned Mr. Chbosky, (the author) was writing and directing, I knew It would have to be something special.I went to the midnight on the night of the 27th to see it after a year of heavy anticipation, and the moment it was over, I didn't even have to think about it, I knew that this was my new favorite movie. It embodied everything about the book perfectly, while only discarding a few things that I'm sure many will agree are fine being left out. The cast is by far the best part of the movie. When I learned Logan Lerman was attached I was annoyed because he didn't seem like someone who could maintain the frailty of Charlie. However, he created the most innocent, awkward, sad and adorable Charlie that i could have imagined. He was absolutely perfect, as were the scene stealing Ezra Miller as Patrick, and the absolutely beautiful Emma Watson as Sam.I've seen it twice over the weekend, and plan on seeing it many times more, especially to continually re-watch the absolutely epic and nostalgic dance scene between Watson and Miller, (You'll know what I mean when you see it.) So I recommend this to anyone who has or has not read the book, and hope that it consumes your soul like it did mine.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Were my bonds really infinite? Am I a wallflower?,"I have sat through more droning, idiotic, ridiculous teen comedies in my day than some of you can imagine. I've seen films with kids attempting to get their entire school high on marijuana, one about a girl modeling herself after coming of age dramas, one about three kids throwing a party that gets a little out of hand, one showing kids stealing the ACT answer-sheet, another about a group of skaters pioneering their bold techniques, and the list goes on and on redundantly. Seeing all of those films, individually, at a point in my life, I took away nothing of significance and assumed that the genre was predominately dead and in search of a new voice.Dear reader, Stephen Chbosky is that voice and his gospel is shown in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, an uplifting, engaging, and entirely complete picture, but even that isn't doing it proper justice. No matter what I say, I can't help but feel I'm oversimplifying its inherent greatness. It's terrifically compelling because of its direct approach to the ups and downs of high schools, and features exuberant characters who are anything but quirky caricatures we see as humans rather than archetypes. Chbosky may be an adult, but he hasn't lost sight of the true fluctuating nature of American high schools, which sometimes seem to be more a competitive battleground than a learning facility.It's difficult for me to dub The Hurt Locker a realistic film, fore I have not been in combat and do not have close connection with those who have. As an active high school student, this film is heavily realistic, right down to the reading material the English teacher gives the students. The plot concerns Charlie (newcomer Logan Lerman), an introverted freshman about to slog through 1385 days of high school with no friends and no true life direction. He's had his run-ins with mental illness, frequently blaming himself for the death of his aunt, who was killed in a car accident on her way to get him a present. To illustrate his fears and internal thoughts, he pens a letter to an unknown friend, so as not to concerns his parents.Soon, he meets the class-clown Patrick (Ezra Miller) and the artsy Sam (Emma Watson), two Seniors, who are step-siblings, that spend their time listening to indie music, making mixtapes, or attending low-key parties. The three strike a notable bond based on their taste in music and unique view on the world, often considering themselves ""infinite.""Wallflower predominately centers on the relationship between Charlie, Patrick, and Sam, showing them at their most confident and most vulnerable. Writer/director Chbosky, who also penned the novel this film is based on giving him almost entire creative control (nobody has any right to say the irrelevant and meaning phrase ""the book was better than the movie"" here), tackles a wide variety of topics. Topics that include mental illness, homosexuality, introverted behavior, relationships, loose friendships, erratic relationships, mixed signals, depression, etc. One must not forget that this is a teen film, so many of the problems had by characters in other films are repeated here, yet that is perfectly with me. Very, very rarely do they play these issues for laughs, and Chobosky's firm grip on the characters and their personalities, allowing the audience to connect with them on a very intimate level make this a picture to simply treasure. And besides, I'd rather watch a serious film about real, but common issues had by teens rather than a comedic film about a niche problem that doesn't take itself as seriously as it wants its audience to.The performances should be unanimously cherished for their authenticity and power that bring this material together. Logan Lerman does terrific work as Charlie, bringing emotion to his character not in a way that feels manipulated and robotic. Ezra Miller, who accentuated pure evil and remorseless malice in We Need to Talk About Kevin, is spontaneous comedic relief, but so darkly serious and honest at times in his portrayal it's physically crippling. And, as expected, Emma Watson is fantastic as the leading female role, especially because she forgoes the anticipated idea of her being the pretty longer with no friends but a big heart. She is a brave, enigmatic soul who is simply trying to discard the past in search of a brighter, more opportunistic future. The side characters are great, as well, including horror-makeup icon Tom Savini as the shop teacher, Paul Rudd as the English teacher, Mr. Anderson, who begins to form a relationship with Charlie (one I would've liked to see explored more), and Joan Cusack, although do not expect a performance of more than two minutes.This is beautiful filmmaking in every sense of the phrase, sure to register with the crowd who recall their high school days and those who are simply sympathetic and empathetic to the current generations' wallflowers. The hardest emotion to achieve or communicate in cinema, in my opinion, is empathy. It's easy to recognize a similar situation you've been in while the character goes about his routine in the same way you did, but do you genuinely feel bad for him or truly feel for his problems? Do you remind yourself he is entirely fictitious, therefore, no real emotions should be felt? I sat in awe as I was presented with raw and unpredictable brutal honest about the labyrinth of high school and regarded my previous years deeply, contemplating decisions, friendships, and the ""unbreakable"" bonds I formed. Were they so infinite? Am I a wallflower? Such questions should be considered for much longer after the closing credits end. This is the smartest teen movie of the new decade.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was brilliant!,"Rarely after watching a movie do i take the time out to write about it so that others could know what my opinion about that particular movie was. Because opinions may vary. Some people may agree to what i think or believe while others wont. But with this, i just had to. Because rarely has a movie had such an effect on me. Rarely have i connected with a character as much as i did with Charlie (Played wonderfully by Logan Lerman) or Sam (Emma Watson) or Patrick (Ezra Miller). When I had a look at the promos, i expected it to be a yet another cliché where you're made to feel pity for the protagonist in the beginning, but all ends well with a feel-good theme throughout. I expected the cinematography to be brilliant, music to be good and all other technical aspects of the movie to be top notch, but did not expect too much of a story. But boy was I wrong! The way this movie handles various serious subjects and meshes them all together without having a feeling of the plots squeezed forcefully is brilliant. And the credit for that goes to the writer director Stephen Chbosky! Made from a book penned by himself, I believe no one understood all the characters better than he did. No one could visualize the book better than him. And that shows throughout the film. You know what the characters are thinking or the reason why they are doing the things they do every time. Its like you know the characters instantly after the first time you see them on screen. All of them. And the director never loses hold of the film. Nowhere does it feel like its dragging. You're into the movie the moment it starts, and manage to stay hooked up until the last frame. Especially the last 15 minutes! I watched the movie again immediately just go through those fifteen minutes again. They moved me. And it is not often that a movie manages to move me. Generally I watch them and i forget, almost immediately. But this one I didn't. All the pieces of acting are brilliant. Logan Lerman is to watch out for.The way he portrays his characters with all those developments is good. Some of the scenes, especially towards the end were breath taking. Emma Watson in her all American avatar was good too. So was Ezra Miller. Although Paul Rudd's character could have been explored more, he was good at what he got. All in all, this is not just another high school movie. No! There is so much more too it. And the way every one of the sub-plots are handled, with all its sensitivity, its good. No matter what age you are, you will connect with the characters. Just Watch it! And yes, Be Infinite! :)",,Anonymous,Romance

'We accept the love we think we deserve.',"Major question: why did this perfectly crafted, intelligently written and acted, touching little film not get nominated for an Oscar? It has all the ingredients of one of the finest films of the year - script based on the writer's own novel by the same name and directed by him, too - Stephen Chbosky - and a superb cast of young actors (and some excellent veteran actors such as Joan Cusack and Dylan McDermot and Paul Rudd, all playing against the slot roles into which others have stuck them), and makes many points about teenage angst and how the schism between teenagers and adults has become a chasm rarely navigable. But, as in current terminology, 'go figure!'Very briefly, the story set in the early 1990s in Pittsburgh is about 15-year-old Charlie (20 year old Logan Lerman), an endearing and naïve outsider, coping with first love, the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam (22 year old Emma Watson) and Patrick (19 year old Ezra Miller), who are step-siblings and welcome him to the real world. Into this ménage enter Brad (Johnny Simmons), the football hero who happens to be a deeply closeted gay boy in an affair with the openly gay Patrick, Charlie's sister Candace (Nina Dobrey) and her abusive boyfriend Ponytale Derek (Nicholas Braun), Charlie's parents (Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh), the influential English teach Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) and the psychiatrist Dr. Burton (Joan Cusack).The story is complex as Charlie writes to his 'friend' and slowly reveals the secrets of his background that make him a loner 'who finds loneliness unbearable, a friend who feels his friends deserve better than they get but cannot bring himself to feel that he does too. He can rise fiercely to the occasion when his friends are threatened but is as fragile as glass when the secrets he carries buried deep inside threaten to overwhelm him.' The manner in which each of the characters change in the course of this story manages to be at once credible as well as entertaining. This is a deeply touching film that deserves a very wide audience. One of the finest films of 2012.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Have a Saturday night date? Watch this.,"So honestly, here's the thing...Perks of being a wallflower is catered to a very specific group of people: teenagers. Watching this film made me feel like I was 15. That itself, is a good thing and a bad one. If you're in the mood for an intense, nerve-wrecking film don't even bother watching this. But, if you want a nice evening with your buttered popcorn and an amazing sound track in the background, go for it! The story line did not blow me away, but the acting, I must say was brilliant. My favourite actor in the movie would have to be Ezna Miller, followed closely by Emma Watson. One would find oneself to be too busy appreciating just how gorgeous she looks and not have to pay too much attention to her acting. All in all, a mediocre story line, with great fresh faces and a very endearing soundtrack! This is the movie to watch if you're in on a Saturday night and want to spend some quality time with your date or simply if you're looking for a nice romance/drama to make your day :)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Nuanced, live wire performances; beautiful..if you were ever a kid, you'll be moved","This stands with the best of the classic movies about growing up - The Breakfast Club, Pretty in Pink, and Some Kind of Wonderful, while all the while being loads more real than any of those films. This is a funny (easily a dozen times where the audience laughed out loud), profoundly moving, and inspiring piece of film.The performances are near-perfect - beautifully raw, genuine, and lacking in self-consciousness. Any doubt that Emma Watson can't be anything but Hermione goes out the window here; she's lovely, aching, alive, and spot-on. Logan Lerman has a palpable vulnerability that makes you root for him to become the creative being you know he can be. Ezra Miller has the sweetly manic energy, charisma and bright smile that gives his character a live-wire presence.And kudos for touching on the importance that surroundings have on young lives: the city and it's features (tunnels, bridges, hillsides) become effective drivers of what these kids are going through as they emerge into fully emotional beings.

Infinitely Amazing,"Every once in awhile a movie comes along that completely surprises you. After sifting through all the major blockbusters that come out every year there is always a movie like ""Perks of Being a Wallflower"", written and directed by Pittsburgh's own Stephen Chbosky, that surpasses everyone's expectations and ends up being one of the best films of the year, despite being an independent film. ""Perks"" does so many things right. Chbosky assembled a cast and then knocked this thing out of the park. He does something big blockbuster so often don't do, he makes you characters that genuinely care about which makes the film as powerful as any other you will see this year. I highly recommend ""Perks"", if for no other reason than that it's by far one of the most heartfelt and original films you will see this year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Journey through troubled youth and discovery in Perks of Being A Wallflower,"Perks of Being a Wallflower has been getting rave reviews and lots of buzz since its release. The genre of youth trying to find themselves is tricky as it can be pretty generic, horribly bad or something great, but it depends on a great story and a cast to carry it in the right direction. This film sports a great cast with Logan Lerman of the Percy Jackson films, Ezra Miller of We Need To Talk About Kevin, and Emma Watson from the Harry Potter franchise, but does it live up to the hype?The Perks of Being A Wallflower follows a young man coping with mental illness, first love, and personal tragedy while trying to step out of the shadows to find a group he can belong too. When he is taken under the wing two seniors his life makes a dramatic turn into the real world. Not only does this film live up to the hype it goes above and beyond it. Unlike most coming of age films, this one has depth to it that was really unexpected. This young cast delivers brilliant performances and has great chemistry together creating a memorable and emotionally charged film about real life instead of the normal up beat imaginary world of Hollywood. Watson steps out of the shadows of the Harry Potter films as not only a beautiful woman, but as a great actress that is sure to continue to light the industry on fire. Lerman and Miller take on their characters with the tortured personalities that push them to the forefront of this film giving it that dark yet sometime light tone that it needs. At first this film feels like your average teen drama, but takes some pretty unexpected dark twists and turns through these characters lives that will surely tug at your emotions on every level. In addition to the great story and brilliant performances all around, the visual style of this film adds to the overall ambiance of the characters themselves and the journey they are on.Besides the great leads, this film also sports a great supporting cast including Paul Rudd, Tom Savini, Dylan McDermott, and Kate Walsh. This is one of those films that while it garnered well deserved praise, still didn't get the credit it deserved. This is one that should have gotten a wider release and recognition for everyone involved. If you haven't seen this film you need to check it out as soon as you can. There is something for every person here and a message of growth and struggle that needs to be heard.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
If it weren´t for Emma Watson,"You can spin it any way you want, but Emma Watson is simply not a good actress. Unlike Daniel Radcliffe, whom I am increasingly taking seriously, Watson is the one of the Harry Potter leads who has learned little or nothing since then. Accordingly, I was sceptical when I went to see this film. For adults, the film is perhaps too didactic, there are few surprises. However, everything is done with a lot of love in this rather low budget production. The last 20 minutes are a bit shaky, as they deal too quickly and superficially with what would actually be worth a drama of its own, but maybe they didn't want to let the mood change. For me, this did not detract from an all-round good impression, which could have been even better if it weren't for Watson.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very surprising,"As I downloaded this film from iTunes, I didn't have great expectations for it but thought it would be a fun watch to pass some time. After only a few minutes I was drawn in and immersed in a rich cast and story.The movie not only follows the main character through his social life, but also through his thoughts as he struggles with a problematic childhood memory which, for me, made the film. The flashbacks give an amazing view of the character and help to define his personality and make him very human to the point I could relate very well.Through the highs and lows of the detailed times, the viewer is swept through emotions with the character. I, personally, finished the film on the verge of crying a mixture of tears of sadness and joy.The casting is absolutely perfect and I cannot imagine anyone better to play the parts, which heavily supports the story and makes the characters more 'real'.This is a must watch film for everyone out there.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Nutshell Review: The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"I guess we have been wallflowers at one point or another in our lives, where we prefer to blend into the background, be alone, and observe. It's a comfort zone that we withdraw into, with nobody giving us a second look, and vice versa. For Charlie (Logan Lerman), a deeply buried incident had caused the inevitable change of behaviour, with a constant worry that the real him may not be well liked by peers. So he's quite the aloof kid, and when introduced in the story, is seen writing a letter to an imaginary friend as therapy, confessing his loathe for soon becoming a freshman in high school, under which this story unfolds.Written and directed by Stephen Chbosky, who adapted the screenplay from his own novel (which was made up of a series of the said letters to that imaginary friend), The Perks of Being a Wallflower plain works, and engages on multiple levels, especially if you had grown up in the 80s and 90s, and would instantly recognize some of the iconic pop culture references used in the books, music, and musicals referenced both in the book origins, and on screen. There's wonderful drama about friendship, and the growing pains in this coming of age tale that had series of episodes that would be easy to identify with, making it seem a little bit closer to our hearts, with an eagerness to embrace it, since it's such a whimsical, nostalgic trip down memory lane.There are elements associated with school life that may likely mirror one's own experience, dealing with first loves and the things we do for them, or those whom we fall in love with out of convenience then find it hard to back out from, the formation of firm friendships, school life from mugging to examinations, inspirational teachers who leave an imprint and encouraging us to fulfill potential, the proms, secret santas, gifts, the silly parties and shenanigans we get into, the extra curricular activities, cheap thrills, vice and fights. And how about those mix tapes as well, where we put together a series of songs for that special someone. The Perks of Being a Wallflower succinctly captured them all with a narrative breeze, without making any seem like overstaying their welcome, and had just enough oomph in them to leave you wanting more.Logan Lerman really shone as the protagonist Charlie, who has a degree of innocence that's ripe for the mild corruption, especially when he hooks up with the brother-sister team of seniors Patrick, aka Nothing (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson). Lerman vividly portrayed his role as the understated heart and soul of the trio, and in their wider clique of friends, who were perfunctory to allow small subplots on various school life experiences squeeze through. He is the emotional anchor in the film, while also grappling with his own inner demons, and shows a tinge of vulnerability, with major struggling with a condition that we'll be privy to in due course of the narrative. And this was a major step up from his Percy Jackson and The Three Musketeers days to showcase some genuine acting chops.And the powerhouse performances continue with Emma Watson as Sam, in what would still be her first few roles in leaving Hermoine behind, adopting a shorter crop of hair to play a spunky lass whom Charlie nurses a crush on, and who has quite the reputation with a long string of ex-boyfriends. Ezra Miller plays her brother Patrick, who has plenty of flamboyance, and is almost nearly the scene stealer with some of the best lines in the movie, topped by a natural charisma for the character who harbours his own secret and pangs too. Chbosky's story has these protagonists painted with a degree of confidence on the exterior, before paring it all down to their core, to see exactly what they were made of. And it's no surprise that all of them were equally vulnerable, and through the course of the story, became reminders on the importance of the building of confidence and gaining of strength from each other's comradeship and company.I suppose for any writer turned director and working on his own screenplay, there's a tremendous sense of ownership and thorough understanding enabling a very true interpretation of what he wants to show and tell. It doesn't get any more truer than this, and Chbosky crafted some incredible interaction and dialogue amongst characters that make them all seem so authentic and real. Besides the offbeat comedy now and then, he really knew when to hammer those deeper emotions in, since the story also deals with emotional damage suffered from the past, which slowly unravelled itself. And not forgetting his very keen musical taste, as can be told from the soundtrack, with David Bowie's Heroes being used as bookends to mark the major transitions in life.There will be moments where you'll chuckle, and moments where you'll cry. There will be moments which will move, touch, hurt, and make you reminisce about an era gone by, all captured in a capsule that is this film. With a packed narrative that's solidly portrayed by its youthful cast, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is that rare coming of age tale that's plenty of heart and emotion, that it's now in my shortlist as one of the best this year has to offer. A definite recommendation!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Add It to the List of Films That Make Me Glad I Never Have to Relive High School,"A solid coming of age film about a misfit high school freshman who finds his niche in a clique of alternative seniors.The version of high school portrayed in this film does not remotely resemble anything I personally experienced in high school, and the film does push the boundaries of credibility a bit in having us believe that these sophisticated martini drinkers are 17 and 18 year olds. And are there that many places in the country where high schoolers are allowed to perform live to the local movie theatre's showings of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show?"" (Or at least allowed to perform it wearing that little clothing?) But I could forgive the film much because it's clearly an adult's ruminations on high school filtered through the lens of adulthood, and as we've all experienced, our memories of things do not always closely match the facts of the things we're remembering.The three young actors at the film's center -- Logan Lerman, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson (of Harry Potter fame) -- give very good performances, but it's Lerman in particular who's the stand out. The film wouldn't be anywhere nearly as successful as it is without him.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very disappointing adaptation,"Having just finished reading the book I thought I would buy the film as I absolutely loved it. I didn't realise I'd already caught the last 20 minutes about 6 weeks ago on TV. It's that different!!I know when you're reading you make your own assumptions about what characters look and sound like, but the actors were nothing like how I pictured them in my head, even their speech. I imagined Charlie to be a heck of a lot more awkward than he really was. Emma Watson was definitely not my ""Sam"" and Patrick was so different, I really do agree with the people stating on here that he was too flamboyant in comparison to the book. I didn't find him (Patrick) as likable or approachable as a character as he was in the books, and I simply don't believe that Charlie would have felt as comfortable befriending him at the game in the book if he were the same way as in the film.The whole film felt rushed and I thought certain pivotal scenes from the book were handled terribly, or missed altogether - EVERYTHING TO DO WITH HIS SISTER AND HER BOYFRIENDS?! The arguing in the car? Dad giving Charlie the sex talk? These would have made great viewing had it been done properly, if at all, and it's such a shame that these scenes weren't depicted in the film.Stephen Chbosky said he turned down multiple offers for a film because he ""owed the fans a movie that was worthy of their love for the book."", but this certainly does not do it justice. It's not even the case that the film was set in the 90's and none of the characters are relatable because they're not walking around with headphones on and a phone taped to their hands (as with many teenagers the same age in this generation). It's small things, like the fact that they chose to have ""Heroes"" as the ""tunnel song"" instead of ""Landslide"" (which didn't work so wonderfully it was worth changing it in the first place).Personally, I don't know how I'd feel about this film had I seen it first and then read the book, but I do know I can't be the only person thoroughly disappointed with how the film has turned out.

WE ARE INFINITE""","You may like Perks of being a wallflower if you enjoy a story with a lot of drama, with a big and important message behind, which makes you cry for good reasons and more, with greeeat young actors and actresses. Inspiring, moving, touching, with an amazing soundtrack. If you like all this, you need to watch this masterpiece!!!
The phrase that i mentioned in the title of my review, changed my life and my perception about all the things. Really did that!!
Like Charlie who felt a wallflower, i felt like this most part of my life and i regret of that. This film is much more than a simple high school movie, is real, is about how the people can be amazing with each other, the opposite also, unfortunately, and how to deal with this!!
Charlie, Sam and Patrick deliver such great performances and you related with that, you know? Is real problems, with real solutions. Is really impressive. 
In the end you feel as if you could face everything and everyone, accepted who you are and deal with the fear and the doubt of yourself. YOU FEEL INFINITE <3",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly good,"Imagine yourself on the eve of your first day of high school. If you'd prefer not to, I get it, believe me. What if you'd just been released from the hospital? Do you really think you could rebound from that?Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), is a quiet, introspective teenager who has recently suffered a setback, the full nature of which we're not informed of, and is about to start his freshman year of high school. The only friend he makes on his first day is his English teacher, Bill Anderson (played by Paul Rudd). Rather than worry his parents, (played by Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh) Charlie gives the typical, one-syllable description of his first day of high school. Time passes and Charlie becomes friends with step-siblings Sam and Patrick. Sam (played by former Harry Potter actress Emma Watson) is an outgoing senior dating a college guy and her step-brother Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) is a flamboyant underachiever with a great sense of humor. They attend a football game together and follow that with a visit to a diner before driving Charlie home. The next function they attend as a group is a party where Charlie, unknowingly, ingests a pot brownie. It is during this moment of drug-fueled confidence that Charlie reveals to Sam the fact that he lost a friend to suicide one year ago. After quietly relaying that fact to Patrick, he and Sam both decide then and there that Charlie should become a full-fledged member of their group. Moments later, Charlie bears witness to a romantic encounter between Patrick and his closeted boyfriend, star football player Brad (played by Johnny Simmons). They leave the party, go for a drive, and hear a song that inspires Sam to stand in the bed of the pickup truck and stretch out her arms as they drive through a tunnel. This is when Charlie first develops romantic feelings for Sam which she is completely unaware of.There's a lot to like about this film. Miller and Watson's characters are both very endearing and their decision to adopt fellow outcast Charlie is a moment that brings hope for the character and life in general. There are elements I believe the film could do without. Examples include the one-sided relationship between two of the characters and the references to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, which never resonated with me the way it seems to with others. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it greatly and encourage others to see it at their earliest possible convenience.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pure Bliss.,"As a die hard fan of the book, I have been following this movie ever since it was announced. Every time I had a chance to get on a computer, I would check to see if anything new was announced. Never have I been so excited for a movie. I just got back from the showing, and I can proudly report that this movie exceeded every single expectation I had. Throughout the movie all I could think was ""This is so perfect"". Everything was impeccable. The adaption and directing (hats off to you, Mr. Chbosky, the filming, the acting, everything. None of the jokes were forced and all of the emotional parts packed a serious punch (almost everyone in my group teared up during at least one scene of the movie). Even in the ending I was crying. Partly because it ended so perfectly, partly because the adaption was perfect, and partly because I didn't want it to end. I cannot recommend this movie more. Even to people who have not read the book, go see it, for it is exceedingly beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Felt too adult,"I give this 6 out of 10 stars because I like the intentions of this film, but am unsure about the subject matter. I feel as if it was a bit pretentious at times- a whole lot of preaching life lessons- and not a whole lot of learning them the way most people learn them (the HARD way).I may not agree with the way the story is told in film, but I do like the cast of Watson, Miller, and Lerman. Lerman gives us a lovable protagonist that many can empathize with. He's entering high school and going about the ""having a life"" bit that the adults all tell their kids to have, and in many cases, force them to have. The parents are rather distant in this story though.Miller is my standout performer in this film. I adore Patrick, and I didn't know a thing about him, yet I felt like I knew him from my days in high school. Watson is stunning as Sam. I wanted to know her even more after learning her freshman year was a mess.I wish the film covered Charlie's relationship with his aunt better than it did. Additionally wish his best friend was at least shown in flashbacks so I could connect even better with Charlie.Overall, I liked this film for it's great music and good intentions.",,Anonymous,Romance
Best film of 2012... In my opinion.,"Every decade has their coming-of-age story. People of the sixties had The Last Picture Show, seventies had American Graffiti, eighties had Breakfast Club and Sixteen Candles, and the only thing I can think of that the nineties had was She's All That. And now my generation of teenagers has Perks of Being a Wallflower. Based on the coming-of-age novel, which I haven't read, the movie follows Charlie, played by the guy from Percy Jackson, and his trials and tribulations of being a freshman in high school. He then meets Patrick, who I swear is a gay version of me, and his sister in law, Sam, played by Emma Watson (Harry Potter). This is an interesting blend of a lighter beat era film mixed with The Last Picture Show. It shows just how naive Charlie is going into high school. Like eating pot brownies, feeling awkward in different environments, and just being a wallflower a lot of the time. He find someone he loves and doesn't really know how to handle it because he's never loved before. He knows he loves her but doesn't know how to tell her and doesn't really know how to react when he dates somebody who he doesn't love. All three of the characters go through the usual mishaps in high school. Patrick is in love with the school's quarterback and they have a secret relationship because they are afraid that the people they love will resent them. It's a sad thing to have to live with being gay and I understand what he's going through. Then Sam is very promiscuous, always getting drunk and sleeping with men. When she finds love and then have it ripped away at the end, you feel heart broken for her because you love these characters by the end and you want to see them lead a good life in college. There's a line in the movie that perfectly sums up this movie, and life in high school. ""Why do I, and everyone I love, pick people who treat us like we're nothing?"" And the answer is, ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" That speaks volumes because I actually know people who feels like this. It's amazing just how right this movie is. I do understand gays being shunned in school, and feeling awkward around a group of people, and having people treat you like we are nothing. I've never seen a movie where I feel a little bit like all of the characters. The performances are strong, the music is awesome, and you walk out of the theater knowing that no matter how bad life may feel in high school, it'll all be better in 1460 days.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
nicely performed,"not a regular teen movie, where all is about getting a girl/guy, sex , or drugs have more than that Emma , and Logan Lerman have done well and they carry the movie . the film have a good mood in itself , i would recommend to watch this movie alone and to enjoy the theme of film , at some points movie have some regular annoying spots but they were required and they were not stretched out , at all its a good movie to watch ,( it's my first review let me know hows it )",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I wish it could affect me like it has many others,"Although ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" was a very good film, there's just too big of a rift between the relatability that it invites and the unbelievability it presents for me to consider it ""the defining picture of today.""Archetypes too typical, occasional scoff-worthy dialogue, and misspent character traits bog it down from god-tier. And some of the directing/ editing choices didn't help.I liked it, to be sure, but I've BEEN THERE (a sentiment the story is designed to evoke from everybody) and it /still/ hardly moves me.I get bothered not because the movie was sad but because the movie should have been sad to me and my un-tugged heartstrings really upset me when so much earnest effort is put into it without significant result.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just No,"Yet another movie that I am baffled by the rating and positive response. The acting is very awkward and forced. Logan does a pretty good job... he didn't talk a whole lot. He would just say his one line and looks would be exchanged and then end scene. Emma's accent was horrendous. I swear there were moments of actually pauses and silence in her scenes because the three actors must not have spent enough time together because their friendship didn't seem real at all. I hate when movies have to cram all these scenes from the book into a short movie, it hardly ever works out for the fans. I just wanted MORE from it! I didn't get that deep emotional feeling I got from reading the book.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
3 reasons,"Emotional, well thought, and revolutionary are three words that describe the film based off the acclaimed novel by Stephen Chewbosky. The movie The Perks of Being A Wallflower is the most true based, realistic movie of this generation. Not only will this movie bring you to the edge of your seat, but it will also make you feel a personal connection to the characters.Specifically, I think the perks of being a wallflower is worth the time and money to see is because of my own personal connection to Charlie (played by Logan Lerman). Throughout the story, Charlie deals with many hardships with his family, and newly found friends. For example, Charlies aunt was killed in a car accident on the way to buy his birthday present when he was a young boy. Throughout my own life, I have already dealt with situations that are unforgettable, such as my aunt getting cancer. Also, in the 8th grade, Charlie's good friend committed suicide. This affected Charlies personality deeply, and the way he acted around his peers.In the 7th grade, my friend was killed by bone marrow cancer, and the impact it had on me affected me as it did Charlie. The character of Sam (Emma Watson) also connected to my own life. Sam was on of the two seniors, the other being Patrick, who befriend Charlie when they meet at the homecoming football game? As soon as Charlie sees Sam, he falls in love with her. Sam believed that love never truly worked out for anyone, as did I. After breaking up with her boyfriend, Sam presents Charlie with a truly puzzling question. ""Why does I, and everyone, love the people who treat us like we're nothing?"" And Charlie answers ""we accept the love we think we deserve."" If we think low of ourselves, we are going to accept people who use us and don't love is for who we really are, but if we love ourselves, we can love others and treat them with higher regard.In addition, the realism throughout the film is what contributes to the beauty of the storyline. The way that Charlie deals with everything he sees is very realistic. Some people, When they see things occurring, they don't know what to do, so they just stand by and observe. That's what Charlie had been doing for some while since his friend died. Then, when he found people who let him in, he began to open up. At a party Patrick gives a toast to Charlie. In it he states, ""He's a wallflower. You see things. You keep quiet about them. And you understand."" It is in this moment that Charlie feels noticed, and completely happy for having friends. This movie also shows the real importance it is to have friends. Before Patrick and Sam, Charlies door was closed, and he refuses to let anyone in. Then, when he gained them as friends, he began to open up to the world, and he enjoyed it. Additionally, this film shows the realisticness of how people judge each other. Charlie's group of friends is judged for being freaks because they are not popular. Charlie is also labeled as a freak because he does not participate in activities.Nevertheless, people may oppose to see this movie. It is rated Pg-13, and many parents feel that they do not want their child to be exposed to the subjects the film discusses. I think that the film is appropriate for kids over 13, as it was rated. The film discusses things like death, personal relationships, teenagers being gay, and even rape. Although this film includes these topics, I think the film is worth seeing for teens. If parents try to hide their son or daughter from these things that occur everyday, they won't be prepared for real life on their own.Moreover, this story is recognized for its great script. The literature Charlie's uses as he writes portrays exactly how he feels as he writes. As Charlie was discussing his earlier trip to go sleeping he writes ""And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't."" This excerpt shows the literature and choice of writing the author uses. The film is also portrayed almost exact from the novel. I think that is part of the reason why this film did very well. The film was directed by Stephen Chewbosky, who also wrote the novel.Not only will this movie change the way you view life, but it will change the way you treat your own friends and family. Also, the people around you. You never know anyone story until they tell you, and you can't judge them until you walk a mile in their shoes. We could all use our own thoughts as an excuse to not participate, but we should choose not to. ""Because things change. Friends leave. And life doesn't stop for anybody."" We should be happy, and appreciate what we have and live for the moments that make us feel alive. As Charlie states in his own moment of pure happiness "" in that moment, I swear we were infinite.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incredible movie,"Beautiful, wonderful, thought-provoking, bittersweet and moving movie. Plot is intriguing, but it is more a character-based movie. The characters are well-developed and you feel an empathy for all of them. The lighter side of the characters is wonderful, the darker sides harrowing, giving a sense of real lives.Think of the movie as a darker, less Hollywood, version of an 80s John Hughes movie. If nothing else, the yearning back towards ones own teen years should be the main take-away from this movie.Excellent performances all round, especially from Logan Lerman in the lead role. Good support from Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott and Joan Cusack have lesser supporting parts.Excellent soundtrack too: The Smiths, David Bowie, New Order, Sonic Youth, among others.Incredible movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I have watched this so many times and every time I watch it I get the same enjoyable experience as the first time I watched it :) I cannot rave about how much I love this enough!! It is an emotional roller coaster and it is like you are going through it along with Charlie. I always recommend it to my friends if they have not seen it and make them watch it with me so I can experience it with them. It is very similar to the book and I enjoy that because a lot of movies in the past have ruined the books. This movie kept me captivated and interested the entire time.

Another Typical Disturbing Romance Drama...,"So, you will LOVE this movie if you are a romance type; if you like movies which depict a love triangle; if you love romantic comedies WHICH give out the same clichéd moral: Love is epic and if you think you are in love, say it!Well, TPOBAW is yet another romantic comedy, only coming-of-age set in the 90s and which deciphers a romance symphony with a bunch of famous soundtracks; it shows you a story of a person who is not desperate, though he metamorphoses from an introvert to an extrovert. Here, the chief rule was forgotten, that you deal with an introvert how you SHOULD deal with an introvert. It failed to charm me because when I am looking for something new, out-of-the-box, groovy, miraculous plot, TPOBAW gives you the expected cup of coffee (or latte). The soundtrack is the best thing about this movie; the screenplay is great so is the direction. And the cast is the cherry on top.Bottom line: The Perks of Being A Wallflower is NOT EPIC. If it gets an Oscar, I'll be damned. But, it is a great winter blizzard.WATCH OUT FOR: Logan Lerman's splendor.Language: Mild Sex: Not really; Foreplay yes Nudity: No Violence: No Mouth-Kiss: Plenty",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Perks of Seeing This Movie? Infinite.,"I went and saw this movie last night with my friends last night at an AMC theater. I will say that I did read the book beforehand, and I was amazed as to how well they transformed such an amazing novel into such an outstanding movie. Every important part in the book was included in the movie if not obviously then somehow portrayed on the final wrap up at the end. So of you loved the book like I did, go see this movie!Those of you who did not read the book: Please, if you don't want to read the book, see this movie. It has something for everyone in it. This is not, I repeat NOT a chick flick. I don't want to be all dramatic and say that it was art, but really this was a masterpiece. The truth of the movie and the underlying secrets of the characters really show how the real world is.On an acting standpoint, everyone played their parts perfectly, but the standouts for me were the three main characters Charlie, Sam, and Patrick, played by Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller, respectively. I had only seen Logan Lerman in two other movies, Percy Jackson (in my opinion, awful.) and Hoot (cute, but not really a hard movie to act in). So, for me, Lerman killed it in Perks, nailing his part as an awkward high school freshman. Emma Watson, breaking away from Harry Potter, did an absolutely wonderful job. I was not looking at her as Hermione Granger, but as Sam, a totally different character. This movie proved how good of an actress she is. Lastly, Ezra Miller. Miller gave his interpretation of a homosexual high school senior who just doesn't give a shoot what people say about him. This character adds comedy to the movie so it's not just a sob story. Miller was my favorite this time around. All the other sporting parts did a great job as well. This was actually a star-studded cast.This is a great movie, and everyone should go and see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

People Will Identify With This Film At Many Levels,"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" brings us back to the early 1990s, telling us the story of a smart but problematic high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman). His spends his days simply avoiding everyone else, until he was accepted by seniors/half-siblings, Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson) into their circle of oddball friends.With them, Charlie is drawn into the teen experience and actually gets to do things which up to then he had only been a viewer from the sidelines. With Sam, Charlie experiences his first love, but of course, as films like this go, it will not be as simple as that.Logan Lerman does a redux of his role as Percy Jackson, a troubled teenager. However, this time he is a normal human being, not a son of Poseidon. This guy can really turn on the angst. He reminded me of a young John Cusack of the 80s or Paul Rudd of the 90s. In fact, since Paul Rudd plays Charlie's favorite teacher, their conversations looked like Paul talking to his younger self. Being some sort of a teenage wallflower myself back in the day, I can feel his pain. This is one very sensitive actor, and I look forward to more movies of this guy.Emma Watson, we were all excited to see graduate from her days as Hermione Granger. And she certainly does here, playing a girl who had been taken advantage of by men and boys with she had relationships in the past and even the present. You can really feel why Charlie got attracted to her free spirit, yet unable to express how he really feels for her. Emma fulfills the promise she had as an actress who grew up in front of all of us. She will be a force to reckon with in awards seasons to come.Watching this as an adult and a parent now, I wonder how the experience will be for my kids growing up into their own teen years. Watching Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh play Charlie's parents, not knowing why their precious son behaved that way he did. It gives us pause to know our own kids more, and hope that they do not keep major life-altering secrets from us.More than the scenes at school, I enjoyed the scenes about their togetherness as a family. I liked the scenes where siblings took time to talk and relate to each other, knowing when one needed help. There are many tiny lessons here and there in this film which viewers can get life lessons from. I can imagine so many people identify with this movie on various levels.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Easily the best movie I've ever seen,"I don't know what it is about this movie, but I was really drawn to it and haven't stopped thinking about it since I saw it yesterday. You may think it's just another stupid teen romance- but think again. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a really moving and inspirational movie for teens; every person can get something different out of it. It really depicts many issues that teens face today and does it in such a stunning and wonderful way I just may have to see it again. The actors were astounding in playing their roles, and it really added to the overall effect that was put on the film. I'd definitely recommend this movie hands down, go out and see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful drama behind its classic teen-movie looks,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower made the top list of my personal favorites for 2013. Even though the movie was preceded by rather favorable criticism, I didn't expect to be taken away as I was. I must say that while reading the synopsis, this is typically the kind of movies that you have the impression of having already seen dozens of times. Except that for once, it stands wonderfully unique. And this is mainly because the nostalgia of the transition to adulthood was beautifully transcribed on the screen. Everyone can easily relate to the main character, Charlie, whether today's teenagers living precisely these experiences or those of yesterday who wistfully remember these golden years. The movie was not exempt from flaws. Starting with the clichés that were still relatively high. However, unlike other movies of the same genre, these clichés did not really matter because of the high affecting realism of the story and the characters.In my opinion, the story draws its strength from the characters. First we have Charlie who turns out to be much more complex than he looks like at the beginning, especially with his morbid emotional wounds. The character was beautifully played by Logan Lerman. His acting really moved me and he makes it hard to imagine someone else playing the role. This is by far his best performance.Sam and Patrick then were the first to truly accept Charlie in their group. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller were perfect. After a small role in My Week With Marilyn, Emma Watson, without her English accent, succeeded to deliver an outstanding performance in her first major role after Harry Potter's lovely Hermione. Ezra Miller keeps setting the bar higher for himself in every one of his movies. This was obviously his best performance so far. He brought life to the picture. The chemistry between actors was clearly there and Stephen Chbosky did an amazing job in his first time directing a movie, adapting his own book.Finally, I would like to say a word about the soundtrack. It enhanced the 80's and 90's atmosphere in the movie and added a profound emotional background to it.Ultimately, The Perks of Being A Wallflower is a beautiful drama carried by a great trio of actors. Behind its classic teen-movie looks, the movie evokes emotions and intelligence with nostalgia. A real must-see!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The world disappeared,"For the brief time at the theater watching this movie, I was so involved with the characters and story that I really felt that the world had disappeared.For me the movie hit a lot of my life in a very personal way. I was never an outcast or somebody with the issues the main characters faced, but life in general has its way of throwing challenges that we all have to face at some time or another.I felt the acting was very well done. Everybody seemed quite sincere in their presentation of their character, which really made me feel like I was watching somebody's life rather than a movie.The movie left me very pensive even days after seeing it, which many movies don't seem to achieve (for me at least..) I think this movie really speaks a loud tone, especially in this country of gun violence by young children. Perhaps the problems and backgrounds of the main characters may give an idea of why those few young people (and even older) decide to kill.Well done overall. One of the best films I've seen in a while.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I have never wanted to like a movie so much, but...","I cannot put my finger on what turned me off of Perks of Being a Wallflower. I lived in Pittsburgh in the 80s through the 90s, was friends with the other misfits in high school and college and even performed in the cast of The Rocky Horror Picture Show for a couple of years. This movie is pretty much about me and my friends.The cast all did marvelous work, particularly the three leads who all turn in rich, understated performances. There is some wonderful dialog, even a few lines that I would go so far as to call brilliant (e.g. ""we accept the love we think we deserve"" and ""I feel infinite"") and the movie is shot in a creative and cinematic way without ever getting flashy.And yet I found myself oddly unmoved and disconnected from the characters and their plight. Moments that were supposed to be emotional and poignant came off as trite and tedious to me. Maybe it was because it was really nothing I had not already seen or that I didn't quite believe it. Maybe it's because as an adult I am kind of embarrassed at what a slacker I was at the time and the movie brings back bad memories of that period in my life.I'm not sure, but whatever it is the movie just never clicked with me. I'm disappointed about that, because I was expecting a really profound experience watching it. Maybe that's it. Maybe I am too close to it to objectively experience it.Perks of Being a Wallflower has some great things going for it. I really, really wanted to like it, but unfortunately I didn't. I feel compelled to recommend it anyway, as it will probably mean more to others than it did to me.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

An amazing movie that sucks you in and doesn't let go. Words can not do this justice. Watch this! I say A+,"""Welcome to the island of misfit toys."" Charlie (Lerman) is a very very shy boy just starting his freshman year in high school. From his first day he counts down the days till he graduates. He meets two seniors Sam (Watson) and Patrick who help him adjust. There are few movies that can suck you in in the first minute. This is one of them. This is a movie that has a character that everyone can relate to, which is very rare these days. There are also movies that are so good that words can not express how good they are. This is also one of those. I honestly can not express how great this movie is and can not recommend this highly enough. I was actually fighting back tears almost the entire time (I almost made it) and for me saying that about a non-sports movie that is saying a lot.

"""I gave her my heart, she gave me a typewriter.""","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" wins the heart of many viewers seeking a film with genuine teen melodrama. Sure, the concept of the film may be hackneyed, but with a bolstered star-power from the casts, and a plausible script, it surpasses another coming-for-age substance on the silver screen. Filmed in the traditional John Hughes and Cameron Crowe style, it's probably nostalgic for some, but nevertheless overwhelming and heartfelt. I never been this instantly hooked for a teen drama film like this before, it's like everything about the genre is getting so much better as the year passes by. Though it's the last teen movie for 2012 to be a clever one, it's impossible to look for a film like this for another year or two.Logan Lerman plays as Charlie, a young man who's pressured for his first day in high school. He's subtle but rather awkward in making friends. As any teen that has new doors to go in, Logan partakes a test in high school life. His first and the only closest friend on his earlier days where his English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd). They're both connected in the same page, and they're also indebted in reading the classics.Not long after Charlie's melancholic episode, he befriends one of his classmates named Patrick during a football game. Patrick is a funny senior student with an offbeat humor. And then later on, his step-sister Sam (Emma Watson). The trio have made an intimate friendship ever since, and that's the obvious part. Charlie has had the impression that Patrick and Sam were a couple, but Sam explains that they weren't. So what unfolds is that Charlie will start to get in love with Sam. In addition, Patrick turns out to be gay and is in love with a football jock (Johnny Simmons).Before Charlie starts getting the ideal attention, there were fleeting series of flashbacks about his aunt which died in a car accident. Charlie have been bearing the pain ever since, so he has been acting very differently. But all of this he can't forget. Instead, he relied on the support of being a wallflower among his friend. This has become immediately effective because of the sympathizing monument.""Perks"" is a strong film about strong characters which thoroughly exists beyond our own self. Part of me tells that the narrative is impossible to resist. It's embedded with nuances and dramatization which we can recognize easily. It can make you cry, pitiful, and make you develop this longing which the characters feel to maintain their friendship together. There is one scene in the film where I consider really sweet and sublime: Where Charlie and Sam develop a sense of hesitation but turns out that Sam really wants to love him at their brief moment alone together.I felt for the actors' persona on-screen. Logan Lerman, whom the last well known project to be the Percy Jackson film attains a fresh coming- for-age male breakthrough performance. He's quite funny and also quite the gentleman, but some of his stubborn dialogue is a downer. Emma Watson ignores the commotion that surrounds her about her Brit qualities. Instead, she perfected to be on an American shoes like how Meryl Streep mastered plenty of accents on many of her films. Lastly, Ezra Miller gave a great feel of being a profound alpha-male bravado. It's funny that the trio develop an unadulterated chemistry which is appealing in the eyes and ears. It's all in shape and form, there's no denying it.The director, Steven Chbosky (based on his book) has written an incredible and profound story with believable materials and voice. He attributes Cameron Crowe with John Hughes into something less generic. The chosen setting for the film was 1990s, but to make it more alive, Chbosky hired Michael Brook to pump some great tunes including The Smiths and David Bowie. As a whole, the film has proved itself to be perhaps a Golden Globe nominee.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved it!,"You must see this movie, especially if you've read the book! I was half afraid the movie would do a terrible representation of the book, but I was pleasantly surprised! The actors all did an amazing job -- especially Logan Lerman who played the role of Charlie. I was speechless at how he made Charlie come to life and how believable his acting was. Emma Watson also did a good job, although I'm still unsure if she was the best pick for the role. Bottom line: The movie just makes you relive that experience of reading the book for the first time, and all the emotions that go along with it. All I can say is WATCH IT!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Welcome to the Island of Misfit Toys,"""Everybody's going to hurt you. You just have to find the ones worth suffering for."" - Bob MarleyAn adaptation of his own novel, director Stephen Chbosky's ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" stars Logan Lerman as Charlie, a shy, suicidal teenager. Ostracised at school, Charlie eventually bonds with a group of misfits, including Sam (Emma Watson) and Patrick (Ezra miller), a couple of free-spirits who, like Charlie, are hiding wounds and deep insecurities.""We accept the love we think we deserve,"" a character states, the line encapsulating Chbosky's chief theme. Belittled by bigots, homophobes, rapists, abusive boyfriends and judgemental eyes, Chbosky's kids internalise persecution and so learn to hate themselves. Believing themselves incapable of being loved, they then embark on paths of self-destruction. All are eventually saved, however, Chbosky an optimist to the end. The future, art, love, friendship, even drugs and sex, have the power to rehabilitate at best, at worst provide good material for tortured artists; Charlie wants to be a writer.""Wallflower's"" signature song is David Bowie's ""Heroes"", a ballad about beautiful losers who nevertheless occasionally taste victory. Life sucks, Chbosky says, but you can triumph in the face of adversity with a little help from your buddies, if only for a day. ""We are infinite!"" Sam screams after hearing Bowie for the first time, silhouetted against traffic lamps as she hurtles through a tunnel. It's a moment of ecstasy, possibility and emancipation, which our cast of kids hope to bottle and preserve and make last forever. But all tunnels end, and everyone's eventually spat back out into the black. The gang cope. They push past dog-eared copies of ""The Catcher In the Rye"" and moody tunes by The Smiths. They learn to survive, if only because they have few other alternatives.""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" boasts some fine atmosphere, nice low-light photography and Chbosky's gang of hipsters are infectious. On the flip-side, Charlie and his friends are a giant writer's fantasy – people like this don't quite exist in real life – Emma Watson is miscast, Sam reeks of what Nathan Rabin infamous dubbed ""Manic Pixie Dream Girl"" clichés, a sexual abuse subplot oozes bad-taste and the film's last act overloads on sentimentality. The film costars the likable John Cusack and Paul Rudd. For contemporary kids, the film has become a minor classic.8/10 – See ""Ghost World"", ""The Spectacular Now"" and ""The Wackness"".",,Anonymous,Romance

The Dead Poets Society meet The Wallflowers,"¨We accept the love we think we deserve.¨ This was truly a wonderful and beautiful film. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those rare teen movies that feels honest and authentic. We've seen similar stories told in other movies, but not in the same way that Stephen Chbosky tells it here with such a natural flow. This is Chbosky's first major film as a director and he does a brilliant job by giving us a heartfelt authentic teen drama with some very funny moments and a romantic love story. This film is based on Chbosky's novel which he also adapted for the movie, and his passion and love for this project really comes through in the film. I don't know if it could have worked as well as it did if it weren't for the three leading performances from Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson), Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin), and Emma Watson (Harry Potter). They were perfectly cast in their roles and they had such great chemistry together. This film made me even more excited for Aronofsky's next movie, Noah, considering that Emma Watson and Logan Lerman were both cast in it. Watson and Lerman share some unique and emotional moments together on screen, but the true star of the film was Ezra Miller who delivered a very powerful performance as Patrick. His role was very different from the one in We Need to Talk About Kevin, and he was just so amazing. The film isn't afraid to tackle dark subject matters such as homosexuality, mental illness, and child abuse, but Chbosky manages to tackle these issues in an honest way while mixing these dark moments with some humor. Ezra Miller really facilitates those transitions with his performance. The Perks of Being a Wallflower reminded me of some other indie teen films that I liked such as The Art of Getting By and It's Kind of a Funny Story, but it also has a sort of late 80's vibe to it that reminded me a lot of Dead Poets Society (one of my all time favorites).The film takes place during the 90's in Pittsburgh where we are introduced to Charlie (Logan Lerman) who is about to begin his freshman year in High School. His best friend killed himself a few months ago and he is going through some sort of mental illness as he experiences black outs and has flashbacks of his Aunt who passed away when he was little. He is quiet and nervous about his first day in school and finds it difficult to make new friends, but when he meets Patrick (Ezra Miller), an outgoing and friendly senior, his life changes completely. Patrick introduces him to his stepsister, Sam (Emma Watson), and the rest of his friends who call themselves The Wallflowers. In his first party with them he accidentally gets stoned after eating a brownie and everyone becomes amused with him and his honest remarks. Charlie feels accepted and begins to enjoy spending time with the group, especially with Sam. Sam begins dating a college boy, and Charlie ends up forcefully dating Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) since he is too nice to say no. Charlie dreams of becoming a writer and he really enjoys his classes with his English teacher Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd) who sees a lot of potential in him. Despite being very smart, Charlie has trouble communicating his feelings to others, and after experiencing a setback with his friends he begins to suffer more black outs. The question remains whether or not he will find the courage to express his feelings towards Sam before the year is over, and if he can unlock the secrets from his past that he is restraining.There are several things that reminded me of Dead Poets Society although this film doesn't focus as much with students bonding with their professor, Lerman does share some interesting scenes with Rudd, the professor. Lerman reminded me of the young and introvert Ethan Hawke, while there is also the issue of one of the students fearing what his father might think about him. Ezra Miller is sort of the Robert Sean Leonard character, although the fears he faces with his father are manifested in his boyfriend and not him, but he does have that sort of outgoing personality and also acts in a play honoring the Rocky Horror Picture Show. The Wallflowers do have some similarities with the Dead Poets Society, but this film does have a much more romantic side thanks to the chemistry between Lerman and Watson. We all saw how Emma Watson grew in the Harry Potter franchise, but here she delivers her best performance to date. I already had liked her in her small role in My Week with Marilyn, and here she gives a believable performance as an American girl. Her accent was just perfect and I really loved her performance. Lerman and Miller also have a great future ahead of them and they proved their talent here in this film. There are also some smaller performances from known faces such as Dylan McDermott and Kate Walsh who play Charlie's parents and Melanie Lynskey his aunt. Joan Cusack plays a doctor and Johnny Simmons is Miller's love interest. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is really a well crafted film worth checking out as one of the best teen movies of the year.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Witty, humorous and deeply poignant, this sincere and heartfelt portrait of a troubled teen's adolescent years will make you feel young again","Countless stories have been told of growing pains, but few are as sincere and heartfelt as 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower'. Adapted by Stephen Chbosky from his own novel, it is the coming of age story of quiet and shy Charlie (Logan Lerman in a beautiful performance, but more on that later) as he embarks on his high school journey with two seniors – Sam (Emma Watson) and her irreverent stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller) - that leads to his transformation of mind and heart.Not often does a successful novelist get to translate his own book for the big screen, let alone direct it, but the creative liberties that have been accorded Chbowsky in this case truly pay off. Here, he has wisely retained the narrative device of his novel, introducing his audience to Charlie via the letters he writes to an unknown recipient, addressed only as 'Dear Friend' – and it is through Charlie's voice-over that we learn Charlie has recently lost his best friend Michael to suicide while Michael's girlfriend Susan (Julia Garner) stridently avoids any association with him to blend in with the 'in' crowd.It is also from his perspective that we learn he has been haunted by the death of his Aunt Helen – whom he believes he is responsible for – and how that traumatic memory has left him in bouts of crying fits. But the self-effacing teenager who keeps a low profile in the hallways and never volunteers the answers in class even though he has them gets a change of fortune when he meets Michael and Susan at a football match.Quickly assimilating into their clique of friends – which includes a vegan punk Buddhist Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman) and a chronic shoplifter Candace (Nina Dobrev), Charlie begins hanging out with them at high school parties, all the while falling even more deeply in love with Sam. In turn, they introduce Charlie to The Smiths (an English alternative rock band), ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"" screenings and marijuana brownies – and though the concoction of sex, drugs and rock n roll isn't new, it's depicted with so much fond nostalgia that you feel as if Charlie's discoveries were your own.Yet Charlie's journey is somewhat different from the typical cautionary tale – too precocious to live life in heady abandon, Charlie instead assumes the role of the titular wallflower, observing the goings-on of Patrick and Sam. In particular, Chbosky details Patrick's doomed relationship with closeted football quarterback Brad (Johnny Simmons), the consequences of that fallout significant not just for Patrick but also Charlie, who is forced to confront deeper and darker secrets from his past towards the end. Charlie also stumbles unknowingly into a relationship with Mary, watching helplessly as Sam gets attached to an older university student.As expected, none of their relationships end well, and within their unfortunate encounters is a lesson that is deeply poignant. ""We accept the love we think we deserve,"" says Charlie, and it is such a heartbreakingly honest confession that you can't quite help but be profoundly moved. Yet the reason these words resonate is not only that they are true, but also that they have proved to be familiar when looking back at the anguish of one's own adolescent years – and indeed, Chbosky hasn't just made a teen drama but a drama about adolescence that anyone who's been through that phase will be able to identify with.Chbosky also trusts in the maturity of his audience to understand the emotional scars within Charlie, old wounds laid bare just as he begins to participate more fully in the lives of the people around him. This is as much a universal tale as it is an individual one, and Chbosky draws us into the very specific mind of a troubled teen who has over the years learnt to go through life by repressing his childhood insecurities. Rarely has a final scene touched us as much as this one, and we guarantee you that when Charlie finally learns to let go to the tune of David Bowie's 'Heroes', it is a transformative experience that will stay with you.It's not easy to play such a complicated teen as Charlie, but Logan Lerman nails it on the head with a sensitive and empathetic performance that is among the best he has ever done. Watson also shines in her best post-Potter role yet, he radiant performance allowing her audience to fall in love with her character as Charlie does. And Miller is pure electricity in the supporting role of Patrick, bringing both warmth and woundedness to portray his character's wit and sensitivity.With generous help from his committed teen cast, Chbosky smartly observes the all-too familiar pangs of adolescence in a film that has both heft and heart. There is a distinct sense one gets from watching the movie that it is also a deeply personal tale, and it is to Chbosky's credit that he has managed to distil his own feelings and experience into a story that anyone can relate to. Even if life hasn't always gone according to what we intended to, there is always this moment in our teenage years that we can proclaim as Charlie does – ""and in that moment, I swear we were infinite"". Chbosky's film does the unthinkable – it makes us feel infinite, and it makes us feel young again.www.moviexclusive.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
First World Problems: The Movie,"First world problems of rich suburban kids: The Movie. Or basically, a feature-length episode of Degrassi.This movie is filled with such whiny, pretentious, self-righteous, self-pity wallowing, predictable, teenage melodrama, that is so falsely attributed to be 'deep' and 'on point' that it's just plain hard to take seriously in any stretch of the word. It's also an enigma; it's a film that many teenagers pretend to identify with, even though its view of typical teenage American life is so hollow, vacuous and falsified...not to mention, very exploitative of real insecurities that teenagers feel, which are only used as superficial character 'defining' traits, never to be elaborated on, to gain audience sympathy. It also only touches on teenagers that live in wealthy suburban areas, making for a very narrow field of their target demographic to represent. It comes across as so insincere and manipulative that it's actually rather infuriating and insufferable.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

This Wallflower blossoms!,"These are the perks of being a pseudo film critic. I can write about any movie, at any time. So therefore, I am going to provide you some perks that you can receive by watching the coming-of-age flick ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". First perk- you will be vastly entertained with Writer-Director Stephen Chbosky's film about Charlie, an introverted high school freshman in Pittsburgh who is befriended by a group of eclectic seniors. They include Patrick, the popular vocal one who is gay; Sam, the pretty gal who has had a bad run with boyfriends in the past; and Mary Elizabeth, the punky Buddhist who takes a romantic liking to Charlie. However, Charlie has his sights on Sam. Charlie did have a traumatic event as a child which is not disclosed until the latter part of the movie; and eventually this situation led to psychological challenges for Charlie. Second perk- Chbosky, who adapted the screenplay from his novel, directs the picture in a method reminiscent of John Hughes classic 80's teen movies; which authenticate the ordeals and challenges that teens go through, and verify that it's not just about fun & games for them. Third perk- Chbosky's screenplay was immensely ingenious and endearing, and very worthy of a Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar nomination. Fourth perk- Logan Lerman's astute performance as Charlie just might give him a Logan's run to more high-profile acting gigs in his career. Fifth perk- Ezra Miller's work as Charlie was probably the best performance by a young actor in a movie this year. This young actor keeps proving that it's about Miller time for him to move up the Hollywood thespian letter with premier starring performances. Sixth perk- Emma Watson proves that she does not need a Potter by her side to demonstrate her acting skills; she was debonair & articulate in her work as Sam. Seventh perk- the movie is set in the 80's, but it incorporates some of today's major teen issues transposed in that time. Eight perk- the killer soundtrack that includes great tunes especially the premier song of the film which would be the inspiring classic ""Heroes"" from David Bowie. Ninth perk- there is even a Paul Rudd sighting in the movie, his restrained and effective performance as Charlie's high school English teacher was an added plus to this unpretentious film. Tenth perk- after you see this movie, you will feel just as good as watching ""The Breakfast Club"" for the 200th time. The premier line of the movie is ""we are infinite"", and lucky for you this review isn't. Nevertheless, I hope I provided you enough selling perks to locate your perking space to check out ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bad acting, fabulous acting.","Just watched this movie, and through the entire movie i thought whether it was a 8/10 or 9/10. But I ended up giving it 7 be cause of Emma Watson and possible reasons that she's casted for this movie. She ruins the whole thing, haven't seen Harry Potter besides from the first two, and had forgot all about her facial mimics. She overplays too much, her eyebrows is uncontrollably and moves all over her face. And on top of that, she never make it feel like she's a ""The Smith's"" kinda girl. This movie scores a bit on pretentiousness since they could have chosen thousands of other actors to play that role, who would have done a much greater and a lot more true job. Though EW really pulls this movie down Logan Lerman really draws it up to be a top movie. His acting is fabulous and I had sympathy and reliability to his role the entire movie through. To me his performance really could have made it a 9/10-kinda movie. Ezra performs as I'd expect from him. He's a good actor, and always a energetic and reliable young man that I hope to see evolve into more movies. I love him. Watch ""Let's Talk About Kevin"" too if you like him as an actor.Writing: 8,5/10 ≠ Camera/clipping: 7/10 ≠ Morale/story: 8/10Emma: 4/10 ≠ Ezra: 7,5/10 ≠ Logan: 9/10 (feels weird to give so different characters for acting in same movie)Overall: 7/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Just Boring,"I Love coming of age movies and this film was getting a lot of attention on my social media so I decided to watch it. (Some advice, don't take movie recommendations from people online.) In fairness, the movie wasn't that bad, It just wasn't good either. Maybe it just wasn't my kind of movie because what I look for in a coming of age film is more up-front and intense whereas this movie preferred to imply without elaborating. I know that a coming of age movie isn't supposed to be action packed, but this movie felt like ordering a really small dish at a super fancy restaurant. I think the main reason for this film being so popular is merely for Emma Watson even though her character was unlikeable in my opinion. Everyone except the main guy was unlikeable honestly, I don't care what anyone says, they weren't good friends.I mean, you can watch it if you want, do whatever, I don't care.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A very touching and mature coming of age story,"My interest was raised after watching the trailer for this film, and after seeing it yesterday I'm happy to say that it is amazing. Now I've never read the book, so I can't say if the movie did the book justice but from a filmmaking standpoint I thought this was done so well.The story, the acting, the writing and the humor was close to perfect as you can get. The story is simple enough (Spoiler free): High school freshman named Charlie (Logan Lerman) begins his high school days unsure of how he's going to fit in. Charlie didn't have the best childhood, and he's definitely the type of kid that wouldn't be respected by his peers. That all changes when he befriends Patrick (Ezra Miller) and Sam (Emma Watson) who are high school seniors who introduce him to the real world.Acting: This is the 2nd film I've seen Logan Lerman in since the 3:10 to Yuma remake where he played Christian Bale's oldest son. He was good in that one, but my God was he great in this film. He perfectly embodies the young troubled boy who must confront his demons, and inevitably grow into adulthood. He reminded me of myself in some ways he was awkward and shy among other people. I was definitely not the popular kid in school, and now that I look back on it I'm glad I wasn't because I would probably be a jackass. He was also very sympathetic and relatable that it reminded me of Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker in the original Spider-Man trilogy. I know this sounds like an odd comparison to you, but to me the way Peter Parker was written like Charlie was made sympathetic and relatable that it made you care about the character, what's happening to him and how he's growing into manhood despite all the trials and tribulations he's been through. Anyway, great performance by Logan, and I'm interested in seeing what he does next. Emma Watson... oh my word, she is breathtaking. I've always liked her since Harry Potter, and it was nice to see her doing something different this time. There were a few times when her British accent slipped out, but it wasn't distracting and I thought she gave a great performance as Sam. Ezra Miller was also excellent as Patrick. Very funny and likable, and I wish I had more friends like him. Paul Rudd as Mr. Anderson played his part very well. It was a small part, but I thought he did a good job with it. The rest of the cast, including Nina Dobrev, Mae Whitman, Dylan McDermott, Kate Walsh and Joan Cusack were great also.The writing was so beautifully written, and felt very natural throughout the film. The music was done very well, and themes presented here reminded me of a John Hughes movie but with a darker spin. Stephen Chbosky did such great work translating his book into a film adaption, which is not an easy thing to do with movies based on books. Again, I've never read the book but I think it was done very well.I've seen my share of films where the actors look like they're phoning in most of the lines, and it seems like they just don't care about whether or not they're making a good movie or not. However, this is one of the many films I've seen where the interactions between the characters feels real and natural that you really buy that these guys are actually really good friends.Final verdict: I give this film an A. The acting was fantastic, the music, the story and the direction were brilliant. This is one of those films that remind us all of the innocence of our youth and that feeling we have of learning new things in life, wondering what lies ahead for us in the future. I cannot compliment this film more, so go see it even if you haven't read the book.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

It covers a range of themes, including drugs (a little) and homosexuality (a little more).There are many funny moments and it was touching throughout.

Better than the novel,"I gave a very negative review of the novel, and wasn't looking forward to the film adaptation. It's still not great, but at least fixes many of the problems with the original story. By streamlining the plot, we get a more coherent focus on Charlie and less of the overly-done-serious-issue-checklist that pervades all the other characters. The characters are also much improved by being portrayed by decent actors who can bring their cores into a realer space instead of the exaggerated stereotypes they were in the original. Sure, they're still pretentious hipsters, but now they come across as genuine figures who aren't all they think they are, as opposed to the straightforwardly idealised figures that infest the book. Additionally, the arc of the introverted Charlie and his underlying issues are treated with far more care and the toll of abuse has a more substantial impact here.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
where is the drama?,"This should be a drama about young people lost in loneliness, their roles as outsiders & how they handle their difficult situation. But it turns out that the movie is actually about some spoiled kids born into wealth, feeling absolutely confident & comfortable in their dandy-role, doing cool stuff all the time, partying hard & even win the hearts of the ones they want to. I expected a little bit more than a 90min story without ANY problems & aggravated circumstances. The story has no climax & no turning point at all which makes it absolutely redundant telling it in movie-length. you might get bored after 30min, expecting a sweeping change in their lives & relationships but you are definitely disappointed after 90min when nothing of that happened. I have to ask: where is the drama & why these kids have no problems to speak about? American drama? American irrelevance.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Yes it is depressing and yes it is dark but it is a beautiful story of a boy who is lost and is pulled back from the brink by his friends. Deeply moving and hit very close to home with me.

"Cool, sentimental, and melodramatic","In The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Charlie (Logan Lerman) is sixteen and an introvert in a central-casting high school with babes and bullies and a post modern touch of gay. In addition, pot-filled brownies, Rocky Horror sing alongs, and child abuse dot the dramatic landscape, eluding the extreme realism accusation with a semi-sweet nostalgic look at high school.The charm of Perks is in writer/director Stephen Chbosky's cool and sentimental notions about coming of age, emphasized by Charlie's voice over and his low-key but at times disturbed recollections on his way to maturity. It lacks the more mature disappointments in (500) Days of Summer, the silliness of Sixteen Candles, the humor of Ferris Bueller, and the out-there of Napoleon Dynamite.On its own merits, it has nothing like those to make it memorable except an appealing Charlie whose arc is not overdone—he just gets a bit wiser as anyone in those years would be if he's aware enough and has the good fortune to fall in love with Emma Watson (playing elusive girl friend, Sam). Throw in some serious childhood trauma , and you still have a melodrama of no great import, just the story of a boyish introvert who happens to be a boyishly good looking actor, Logan Lerman, and his new, eccentric friends, headed by lovable Sam.Is it formulaic? Yes, but in the service of known teenage behaviors not too far from a serviceable Hollywood reality. Do bullies harass him? Yes, but less than in other clichéd films. Does he fall in love with an unattainable girl? Yes, but he doesn't madly pursue her because his mind has other more substantial demons. Is he the brightest but quietest student in his English class, Yes, but we all know the price to pay if you answer English teacher's questions right, so his reticence is strategically acceptable although he is so reserved you might initially question him as the protagonist of any film. Is his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), tuned into him? Yes, but in one of the most realistic ways I have seen.This is not the hip Breakfast Club or Risky Business. Yet, it does have its charming perks.",,Anonymous,Romance
Massively disappointing ending,"People don't go see movies to be reminded how bad life sucks, and this movie is slap in the face of anybody who dares to dream.Judging by the title and the previews, I was led to believe this movie was about being a shy and awkward teenaged boy. IT'S NOT!It was going alright, in the beginning. I like how he has a gay best friend. However, his gay friend SUCKS! Totally unrealistic, and not a positive representation of a homosexual youth. BAD ROLE MODEL! Can't we have just ONE decent gay role model? Please!?!Also, it doesn't present the most positive view of females, either. The way it makes girls seem so delicate, difficult, complicated, and emotional is woefully outdated.I hated the way they treated him for kissing the girl he really likes. It's not like he's married, or anything. And, for once he shows he actually has a pair. You'd think they'd respect the guy for showing his true feelings, but instead they treat him like a rapist. Who are these people?I don't like most of the personalities in this movie. His friends aren't cool people. Really! Who would actually hang out with these kids?It's certainly no Breakfast Club, which is what it was advertised as being. No, I'm not comparing it to the classic for not living up to the hype. That's not the problem.The ending blatantly SUCKS! It was going along OK, and then it turns into this preachy nonsense about child abuse. It isn't even clear about what it's trying to convey, either. They never just come right out and say what really happened to him, as if it's so taboo we can't even talk about it.All along I was hoping for a movie about an undervalued misfit overcoming the odds. Instead, I got a preaching to about the harms of child abuse, as if I needed it. It doesn't even have a happy resolution. Bittersweet, at best. However, not in any kind of satisfying way. I appreciate that it's trying to be realistic, but maybe it's just a little TOO realistic?Anyways, it wasn't all bad, and does have some charming bits. Although, they don't really add up to enough to make this a great movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Superfluous film. Adds nothing new to many other films and TV series about the same social environment,"I saw this film at the Ghent filmfestival 2012. I must confess upfront that I find this film superfluous, given the overload of TV series and films that also center around high schools and their population. One might falsely think that striving to be popular and ""cool"" is the main occupation of an average adolescent. This film adds nothing new or original to this overload, and does not even attempt to show that there is more to the subject. Further, this film concentrates too much on a single person, the alleged ""wallflower"", and leaves the remaining persons very much as entourage.What hinders me in the scenario is that our main character can only be considered a wallflower for a relatively small time frame. He gets some friends in an early stage of the story, albeit all these are older than he is. What helped in acquiring these friendships is that he could show several talents in the context of prose and poetry, and that he also had some talents as a stand-up comedian (probably only when under influence, but still).I scored a 1 (lowest) for the audience award when leaving the theater. I am at a loss why this film ended on place 8 for this award, with an average score of 4.52 (out of 5). I can only assume that other people find interesting material in these stories, which theory seems confirmed by the scores on IMDb. Maybe I'm just too old (64) for this.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most fantastic film i have seen in a very long time.,"This film is truly beautiful. I haven't seen a film that moved me quite as much since Son of Rambo. Massive kudos to the writer, turning an amazing novel into a spectacular film.Wasn't expecting much from Emma Watson, but she really pulled it out the bag with her performance, on top of ALL the other actors. This film is an amazing piece of art, and everyone has to watch it.I am surprised at the low ratings it has received so far. Something as genius as this, you would expect it in the 9.5+ ratings. Just make sure you have a box of tissues if you decide to watch this film. It was nicely paced and had a lot of content in, which all films lack these days.

Love it,"This is one of my ultimate favorite films, I love the main character's development and this movie as a whole. I never get enough of it. Although the movie doesn't completely cover the book but it was arranged amazingly, the cast, direction and everything. I must admit the first time I've watched this I was in tears throughout the entire film, not sure why but after re-watching it several times it turned into my go to feel good movie. It doesn't have the cliché everyone gets what they want ending nor does it have the everyone is miserable in the end thing either, the ending is one of my favorite parts of the movie and I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the whole ""not okay teenagers"" cause it takes the matter somewhat realistically.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A very good film, only held down by very small faults.","The Perks of Being a Wallflower follows Charlie, a friendless freshman with a dark mind and an even darker past. He sits alone and has no one to talk to. Until a group of seniors invite him and let him join their group of outcasts.The character of Charlie is portrayed by Logan Lerman, who does an extremely great performance as a shy, awkward teenager. Emma Watson and Ezra Miller also give a great performance. The film has quirky comedy elements and captures the essence and thoughts of being an adolescent growing up in a world inhabited by idiots. The music preferences, the friendless and shyness that comes along with being an adolescent is incorporated into the film. Also, the film includes some very serious themes that teenagers deal with. It is a very well portrayed and directed film, with a special nod to the writer and director who also wrote the book Steven Chbosky. I found that the character's all had something which we could relate to, it was accessible to all ages and had a very good ending which makes it situated at the top of the hill in terms of coming-of-age films.However, with all that great, comes a few faults. A few of the jokes didn't land and a few scenes had a predictable outcome, which made the film feel predictable. I think it could've explored some it's themes a bit more. It felt like it stopped half-way onto something great and the reasoning behind that I'd imagine is that Steve wanted the film to be 15 or PG-13 at most. The performances lacked by the supporting cast, especially in comparison to the mains. A few scenes felt unnecessary and a few scenes also didn't make the transition from the book to film very well. But aside from that, it was a very good film, easily accessible and one of the best coming-of-age film I've ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could Have Been Better,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a movie that could have been a lot better than it is.The story is very emotional, the plot twist was very unexpected and refreshing. The characters are very relatable and well-written. My favourite character is Patrick, because it's very relatable to me that he suppress the pain and shows his good side to everyone. The dialogues are natural and incredibly realistic.The directing is not bad for a first timer, but the movie is technically flawed. There are nice things in cinematography, but overall it's boring and it doesn't offer anything outstanding. The editing isn't bad either, but just like the cinematography, sound, production design and score, it doesn't live up to the quality of the writing. The acting though is great.

To Help Stabilize The Score,"Really great vibe. Many teenage films I have watched. This one stands out in several perspective. The cast is glamorous, though Emma do look a bit old fashioned (but hey, the movies set in the 90s right? It's not like popular girls are always the same through out the years) Miller as Patrick is funny and has weight. The plot is great, even though I hear there were a lot of deletions from the books. Important characters arc are very well developed, and I have to say this is probably the furthest step a teenage film production has taken.In many ways, The Perks Of Being a Wallflower succeeded. Delivered great messages, gags, and heartfelt moments. Go watch it!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A complete clichéd mess which takes itself far too seriously to be enjoyable in the slightest.,"I hadn't heard of The Perks of Being a Wallflower book before this film came out but apparently it's a big hit with people my age (albiet particularly girls). I wasn't interested until it started doing very well with audiences to the point where it entered IMDb's top 250, and is still in a solid position. I wasn't excited but I was intrigued. I was mostly intrigued at the prospect of the author of the original book writing the screenplay and directing the film himself. Can the author of the source material finally do justice and equal the book? Can this be a genuinely original and heartfelt high school movie? The answer is no. Not in Stephen Chbosky's hands anyway. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a self-pitying dead weight inhabited with paper thin characters whose personality is replaced with eccentricity, let alone lack of depth. To be fair, that is what high school feels like, but it's an awful unpleasant feeling I don't want to relive. Its lead character is a cardboard cutout whose interesting moments of change are so left field and bizarre that it's difficult to connect with him at all.Emma Watson has a terribly inconsistent American accent and lacks any identity beyond a vague irritating Manic Pixie Dream Girl. Ezra Miller does have some welcome enthusiasm, given his restrained performance in We Need To Talk About Kevin, but his character is all over the place. It's a film that deals with a zillion things at once and all of them are clichés in and area I wouldn't be able to relate to even if I was in my equivalent of high school. But the most off- putting part is the horrible lighting and set design. The film might have been okay if it wasn't so poorly lit but that's a stretch. It hits a few interesting notes here and there but it's nothing redeeming and they're swiftly ruined by the next moment approached awkwardly. However, it does have an excellent taste in music and features a lot of my favourites, unfortunately it has no idea how to use them and frustrates me as it cuts before the good part. There's also the big gap in logic of Emma Watson having pretty great taste in music but having no clue what an incredibly famous David Bowie song is. But hey, if this film introduces a generation to this great music, fine. Not my preferred method.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best from this year,"I don't know if it is age or I'm getting more difficult but lately it's been difficult for me to walk out of the theatre and feel satisfied.But this movie made that possible. I had my doubts when I went in as I didn't feel like watching another ""Teen"" movie (I'm 38 in case you wonder). But ""The Perks of being a Wallflower"" just blew me away.The movie just felt so honest, .. deep, and yet simple. The three main characters Charlie, Patrick and Sam feel real, .. but in ways I've rarely experienced in a movie. It's easy to identify with any of them as we all most likely encountered at some point in our life at least one of the issues they face.I can only recommend this movie as it made me smile and I thought back to the movie for days, .. which doesn't happen a lot with movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Movie I've Seen In Years!!!!,"I have seen a great many films spanning from the 20's until present day. I can honestly say I've never seen a film like this in my life and I can only hope there are more like it in my lifetime. I am a hard person to please having ""seen it all"" but this movie truly touched me in a way I couldn't possibly describe in words. Others may believe the film can be a little vague at times, but I believe it gives the viewer the ability to place themselves in the plot. This made possible because there isn't a single person who can't say they don't know what Charlie is going through to some degree. Those who feel the need to put this film down are only doing so because they simply can't grasp the true meaning of what this film is trying to portray. I hope if you feel this film didn't quite do it for you then I urge you to watch it once more. Surely everything merits a second chance as I am sure this film does.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I hate it for loving it,"You will hate this movie. There's no question about it. You will hate it because you will find it stupid and/or boring... or you will hate it because you relate to it so much.

It's well made and rather well acted, however relating to this, adds so damn much that regular watching might just seem stupid.I've watched it a couple of times and it's true on all levels... even the awkwardness. No complains from me, but then again, I am a light critic.I have to give this movie one thing for sure... it does capture the mind quite perfectly.

We Accept The Love We Think We Deserve,"Crafted with genuine care n affection, told with heartfelt sensitivity & bolstered by three key performances, The Perks of Being a Wallpaper is an exquisite coming-of-age drama that beautifully captures the highs n lows of adolescent life, wonderfully illustrates the value n importance of friendship & remains one of the most heartwarming examples of its genre.Based on the novel of the same name, The Perks of Being a Wallflower tells the story of an introvert freshman who's incredibly shy in making friends, is coping up with the recent loss of his best friend & is desperately seeking the company of people he can feel comfortable with. Enter his two seniors who accept him as one of their own & welcome him to the real world.Written & directed by Stephen Chbosky who also wrote the novel this film is adapted from, The Perks of Being a Wallflower brims with creative energy, teenage spirit & strong passion for storytelling and is a highly impressive work for a debutant filmmaker.

Lerman is truly a revelation here, Watson is mesmerising as always while Miller chips in with a strong contribution, and their spot-on chemistry with each other is the film's biggest highlight.On an overall scale, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a delightful surprise that also works as an intriguing meditation on loneliness, depression, companionship & the haunting effect one's past can have on his or her present. Purely honest with its content, sincerely adapted for the screen & up to the mark in all aspects of filmmaking, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an enjoyable, entertaining & emotionally uplifting cinema that's delightfully recommended.",,Anonymous,Romance
Wasn't expecting that scene,"Here is a movie I'll probably rewatch.

There was one scene at the end, though, that floored me. I hadn't really felt a whole lot from the movie until that one scene, that just suddenly cut to the quick and almost had me in tears.The movie hadn't been that incisive up until that point, so now I feel moved to watch it again knowing that that scene is coming.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Harry who?,"Out of the three leads of the Potter movies, Emma Watson might be the most talented. Actually she not only might be, she is! Proof can be found in this movie right here.

Even some of the scenes that are borderline to cliché do work here, because the acting and the writing make them work.The coming of age story, is really well told. As a drama it unfolds very well and there is always something that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's a great story and a movie that you have to watch, if you like a good/well written drama.

Review about the Perks of Being a Wallflower,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a movie adapted from the epistolary novel written by Stephen Chbosky about Charlie played by Logan Lerman, a teenager who lives his freshman year of high school. He has to cope with struggles such as the suicide of his best friend, his difference compared to the others teenagers, problems with his family,... During the year, Charlie will get closer to Sam and her step-brother, Patrick played by Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. During the movie, you learn more about Charlie's life and that he has to cope with more than high school problems. This story shows many teenagers' issues.I think that many teenagers could relate to it. I really recommend this movie or even the book, because it is a very moving story.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
These Are The Perks,"I went into this film not having read the book and not knowing anything about the plot. And while I do not condone anyone that read the book, I was so pleased with all of the surprises that opened up as the movie progressed.'Perks' has it all. It pulls and twists at every awkward emotion teenagers have felt through the treacherous time that is high school. There are times of anguish, sadness, glory, revenge, love, depression, futility, etc. So many times you just wanted to jump in and tell poor Charlie that things would turn out alright. His relationship naivety and blatant honesty made him such an intriguing individual, that you could not help but root for him.Most high school films are cheesy and the clichés are overpowering, but 'Perks' stayed truly original from the party scenes to the lunchroom antics. It paid dividends that the author, Stephen Chbosky, was able to take his vision in his novel and portray that on screen exactly how he wanted. The storyline was patient and the pace moved perfectly to keep me thoroughly entertained throughout.Though Emma Watson may be the high-profile name in the cast, it was Logan Lerman stealing the show. Remember his name. He took the innocent- freshman-with-a-mysteriously-broken-past-just-trying-to-fit-in and ran with it so well, I forgot that he is actually 20 years old. Ezra Miller also played a great compliment as Charlie's confidante and best friend, and Watson added some enticing flair as the love interest.I cannot wait to buy this DVD when it comes out and watch it for years to come, for as high school movies go, this one is as timeless and truthful as they come.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best movies of the year!,"I just read this book about two weeks ago. I read it in less than a day. I found it to be heart wrenchingly honest with a fresh approach to mostly standard material. Afterwards I rewatched the trailer which although I thought looked good it felt very different from the book I read. So after a few weeks in limited in finally made its way around to my local theatre. Well I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Because the film really captures the material while enhancing it with a truly appreciated honesty rarely captured in films of these kinds. The book which featured letters written to an unknown person describes the life of it's main character Charlie loosely based on the author/writer/director himself has been visualized in a somewhat amateur but throughly engaging and unflinchingly honest portrayal of a struggling young man coming of age. The book which dealt with depression, suicide, drug use, abuse, molestation, bullying and a barrage of enhanced emotions are expanded upon and explored in the film. There are moments where I found myself forcing back the tears as my throat felt like it was closing. It's a film most if not all people if they are honest can relate to. Logan Lehrmans lead performance as Charlie is astounding and must be seen it's one of the best of the year. On the downside Emma Watson feels a little forced as Sam and Ezra Miller does a little too much over acting as Patrick. Still the book and movie creates a character in Charlie than we can love and appreciate. The complexities of his emotions and the way he deals with them are visualized in some truly brilliant sequences. The downside besides the supporting performances are the dreadful cinematography the film looks fudgey and way too low budget and a bit of a forced sense of the cool factor. Besides that the film is a truly unique experience and should take it's rightful place as one of the best teen movies ever made and one of the best of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great movie about a troubled introvert develops beautifully.,"3.5/4I must admit up front, I was very surprised that I liked The Perks Of Being A Wallflower as much as I did. I walked in with pre-set expectations, and while most of them were indeed met, this movie soared high above them in many ways. It's more than a typical, plastic, and fake teen movie. While some may praise The Perks for its image of rebellion, it's raw, unflinching truth and depth would make it appeal to a wider audience of teens and adults as well.The director, Stephen Chbosky, also wrote the screenplay for this movie, AND the book that the movie is adapting. John Hughes was originally slated to direct this, but when he died, Chbosky assumes full creative control. I am glad this happened, because the story is his vision, and he's getting to realize it through a whole new medium. He evidently knows how to work a character, and they all seem worked to perfection.The story follows a wallflower named Charlie who has trouble connecting with peers, as well as a traumatic event from his childhood (revealed at the end of the movie) hold him back. This movie chronicles his freshman year of high-school, which entails gaining and losing relationships, and ultimately finding his place I The middle of teenage angst. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower never fails to be brutally honest about Charlie's emotions and problems in his life.Everyone of Charlie's friends is a senior in high-school. While they have problems in their own minds, there is a separating factor between theirs and Charlie's. Charlie's problems are purely based on unfortunate circumstances, while his friends problems are for the most part brought on by themselves. The way it's subtlely conveyed: Charlie is from middle-class roots while his friends are from the elite wealthy. They offer Charlie support, and they think they can relate to his feelings. It turns out that they have was each other's solutions. Charlie needs someone to take interest in him, and his good friends need someone who's willing to listen to them. This rings true to a teen culture, that everyone experiences at some point, which is filled with both self-indulged and personal real-life issues. Everything is so confusing, especially when depression, love, and need-for-acceptance all want to take the front seat.As far as the acting, Charlie (Logan Lerman) and Patrick (Ezra Miller) totally steal the show. Patrick is the class-clown and helps keep the heavy-handed plot fairly light-hearted and fun, while Charlie is just a great all-around guy, just with a past that was horrible to him and a boatload of anxiety. The actors keep the characters relatable for the full effect of their preformances.If you haven't had the pleasure of getting to see this gem, take advantage. It will resonate with anyone who is currently in, or who has ever been through adolescence. All in all, it's a great coming-of-age tale and phenomenal among the ranks of ""teen movies"".",,Anonymous,Romance
Heartfelt yet uneven,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower certainly has its moments of genuine emotional depth, thanks to its heartfelt performances and some well-written scenes. Logan Lerman and Emma Watson deliver solid portrayals, adding a layer of authenticity to their characters that helps anchor the film. The nostalgia and sensitivity it brings to adolescent struggles are commendable and resonate with a certain poignancy.However, the film struggles with its uneven pacing and melodramatic turns that often feel forced. The plot, while earnest, veers into predictable territory, and some of the character arcs seem underdeveloped or overly idealized. The attempts at tackling deep issues can sometimes come off as superficial, and the overall execution lacks the subtlety that could have made it more impactful. The film tries hard to connect, but its uneven approach makes it a bit hit-or-miss.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Easily one of the worst movies i have ever seen....,"MAY BE SPOILERS!!!OK... so last night a friend came by and wanted to watch this movie. and while i don't like Emma Watson in any form at all i was up for it having never seen nor heard of this movie. Let me begin with the bad..Cinematography: WTF?! The camera work is college student level at best. And apparently the focus on their camera was broken or Barbara Walters was controlling it. They couldn't make a more out of focus blurry movie without covering the lens in vaseline.Directing: Was there a director? Shouldn't the director have caught the above mentioned camera issues? Or perhaps the indeterminate time-frame of the movie? Supposedly 91 or 92? Yet crackers ""low"" was released in 93.. and is in the movie. As a director he could have repaired A lot of the horrible writing on the fly. In the scene where brad says to Charlie ""thanks for stopping them"" And they left that hanging? They could have had Charlie just reply ""you should have stopped them, not me"" something along those lines.. a MUCH better ending to that. Moving on...Writing: Boring bad dialog.. Emma Watson saying ""shag"" at the football game.. i have never heard one single American kid use shag in the context she did there.. it would have been screw or bang.. never shag.Although there are some bright spots in the writing.. The ""i wish one of us had cancer so i wouldn't have to deal with this breakup"" (para- phrasing) Is awesome and i will be using it.. Oh.. and Emma Watson being a ""wallflower,outcast"" type kid.. please.. really? How bout stuck up snobby broad banging the football team. Bad casting, but thats just my opinion..And WTF is with Charlie shoveling snow in a small circle? in reallllly poorly done fake snow.. Also. a house like that with a 6 car garage and hes using a hand shovel to clear the driveway? Um... NO...By the end i was praying for Emma Watson to catch a low bridge when she was doing her titanic flying scene in the back of the truck... Nothing against her.. just would have made the movie much more interesting.I Realize i am not near the demographic that this movie was made for, I am assuming its for 13 year old shut-ins with mental issues and IQ's hovering well below triple digits.P.S. If they had ended the movie with Charlie eating a gun and the screen just goes black i would have liked this movie MUCH MUCH more.. but as every movie made now has to have all strings tied up and everyone lives happily ever after. we get what we get.Sorry for rambling.. still reeling from this being in my brain for the rest of my life.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Amazing!!,"This movie has touched my heart. there were points in the film where I felt like laughing or crying, or could closely relate to the character. The movie is serious without being TOO serious and funny all the way through. The only other movie i could compare this to where i had the same feelings was 50/50 because one actually feels for the character at hand. The main character was so complex, yet so simple. He had many problems bottled up inside, yet felt for others more than himself. Quite a few twists and suspense kept me furthermore intrigued and it leaves you with questions unanswered, in a good way. I gave this movie a 10/10 because at the end I, as a man, cried and I've rarely done that, especially around my friends. Same as 50/50, that's the only other movie in which I've teared up in public. When i needed to go to the bathroom, I held it because I didn't want to miss a single second of this masterpiece. I was really weary of Logan Lerman after seeing Percy Jackson (complete disaster) but he really impressed me. All characters and people involved in this production have earned my respect.

The perks of being a wallflower is a surprisingly good movie,"I didn't expect much when I picked The perks of being a wallflower to watch. Casting was unknown for me except for adorable Emma Watson, who really makes a really good performance in the movie.For me the movie really reminded me of my high school years. First I thought that the movie was about a bullied kid and how he survives the American high school, but I was happily surprised how deep the movie really is. Its themes on sexuality, sex, social diversity and mental subjects gave me a real pleasure watching it. I could really see myself as Charlie bullying aside. This flick is an awesome, realistic, view on ones life. The movie sets on a short period, only one semester, but it really captures the viewers heart and focus. It was kind of a deep drama but I didn't feel sad during it, actually it made me kind of happy. It was nice to think back to my own high school years and my first love. I think many people can really identify themselves with the movie.In conclusion the movie is a brilliant classical movie, the main point is the story and how it's shown.

A wonderfully nostalgic coming of age drama,"So we have another coming of age drama, not exactly a starved genre but this is one of the best I have seen and is a wonderfully nostalgic throwback to the 80s in the way American Graffiti was to the 60s. The late 80s was a time when I loved watching teenage angst in movies like Some Kind of Wonderful or Risky Business followed by a horror movie where said protagonists are stabbed or slashed in inventive ways on Elm Street or the likes. Perfect double bills, ah miss those days!I cannot convince any of you that the underlying formula of this film is significantly different to others in this genre but I promise this is nevertheless not a clichéd run of the mill, trippy road movie (though there is a bit of tripping in this). The main characters have layers which are slowly peeled away as the film progresses. I was very warmed to the earnestness of these characters and their developing stories. The story being told from the point of view from a fresher year student who is an introvert trying to do the best he can to fit in, is as stereotypical of a protagonist you can get but thanks to Logan's sublime performance, his execution was exquisite, humorous and very realistic, not overdone as is the case with many other films in this genre. He is befriended by two slight eccentrics (Emma Watson and Ezra Miller), bringing him into their exclusive circle of ""misfits"".What makes this film stand out for me then? I think its a combination of many elements. Immaculate direction by the director who is also the author of the book that this film is based on which is interesting, as the only one other example I can think of is Michael Crichton who also directed his own books into movies. The choice of delightfully eclectic 70s/80s soundtrack perfectly complements the variable moods. The smoothly flowing narrative plays out with a poetic grace, infusing heart and soul, intrigue and wonderful characters that some of us have met in one form or another during our college days.To top it off, the three main protagonists are beautifully conveyed. Its great to see Emma Watson able to free herself from the shackles further away from the Hermione persona after her small transition role in My Week With Marilyn. She equips herself well with natural aplomb, giving an earnest and heartfelt performance. I hear negatives about her accent which frankly, I find preposterous. First of all, I didn't notice if she has a British or American accent because when you are in a college, students come from different backgrounds and accents are mixed anyway. Secondly, its the performance that enraptures me, not the accent. If we are supposed to criticise accents then we might as well lay it thick on Sean Connery's Oscar winning performance of an Irish cop who sounded very much like a Scotsman, yet he still got an Oscar...maybe it was because of his performance, huh? The stand out performer, however, was the other supporting character, Ezra Miller who oozes charisma and I think we'll be seeing a lot more of this lad in future. I cant say much more about his character though because as I said they have layers which are slowly peeled away.There is a revelation at the end but to be honest, while its actually a good one and makes the film even more substantial, it didn't need to have it. I would have been completely satisfied with the movie without it. I also think it drives a somewhat misleading message about certain types of people.Having said that, I had a wonderfully nostalgic time with this film which delivers an emotional journey of ups and downs, building to a both an uplifting and poignant crescendo, so it is for that experience I give this a 9/10.I especially recommend this for those of you who like American Graffiti, Some Kind of Wonderful, Hugh Walter movies etc.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautifully Awkward,"I really liked the perks of being a wallflower. I loved that it was awkward, I loved that it was flawed. the details melted my heart, the silly moments, the almost kisses brought me back to high school. The glorious moments in the missed opportunities, and the mistakes made it all real for me. The heartache was genuine, the dreams were ideal and raw so yes i liked the perks of being a wild flower. Moreover, i liked that it was a coming of age movie. it was simple, not exaggerated, borderline real. The only thing i missed was the magic that connects me to the movies, just missed it barely but it just was not enough. I love movies but very few resonate with the romantic skeptic in me.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Cute and understandably ""nice""","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a great screen adaptation by an incredibly gifted author, screenwriter, and director; Stephen Chbosky. He has masterfully brought enjoyment, and a feeble attempt of depth, to a story of a teenager coming to terms with himself. Played by Logan Lerman, the main story driver, the audience is exposed to a wild ride of emotions, and vulnerable situations. Emma Watson, the star capture of the movie, brings little to the plate, and seems replaceable. Regardless, it tries very hard to make sense of life's hard lessons, and is willing to breach the taboo lines. The Perks of being a Wallflower is a dramatically cute story.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Different from the book,"It was pretty good, but I really wasn't a fan of the main character (especially in the beginning). The movie also toys between adventure and drama and one of those specific molestation discovery movies, so I feel like it's interesting to watch a single time but not a movie you'd be likely to rewatch.First reaction: The lead doesn't act well. At all. The way he talks to the diary at the beginning of the movie is really not believable. In the book, he is sensitive but optimistic and loving, signing his entries with ""Love Always,"" and always wishing the best for everyone. In the movie, at the beginning he is annoying (eg curt reply to his nice English teacher) and depressed and definitely does not exude well- wishing. As the movie goes on, though, either you get used to the character or he becomes more believable. Especially believable in the end molestation scenes, though granted that may be because I don't know how people would actually act in real molestation discovery and hospital treatment situations like that.That said, Patrick (Ezra Miller) played great. And Sam (Emma Watson) of course.Also, from the very start the movie doesn't exactly follow the book. Which is fine if you haven't read the book, but annoying if you actually had read the book beforehand and are not just watching the movie.For instance, the shop teacher Callahan actually likes Patrick's impersonation of him rather than chastises him for it, the girl in advanced English is Susan rather than a separate girl, Derek hits Charlie's sister under very different circumstances, Charlie's English teacher is an unmarried hippie rather than a married professional, etc. The movie doesn't just cut stuff out, it changes stuff.Overall, though, the movie is engaging and does have some interesting philosophical aspects to think about.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unexpectedly outstanding,"I have watched so many rubbish teen films that my expectations for such a film have inevitably been lowered to avoid disappointment. Before watching The Perks Of Being a Wallflower, I had expected either one of two eventualities. Either the filmmakers decide to be overly ambitious but miscalculated, creating an overly dour, depressing story with no entertainment value. Or they make something trite and formulaic, overly breezy, polished and contrived to a fault, bearing no resemblance at all to reality. I am glad to say that Wallflower deftly navigates between both extremes, delivering an emotionally precise, yet uplifting and entertaining story.Indeed much credit is due to the screenwriters. Wallflower manages to take care in balancing drama and entertainment, in making sure the troubles of its main character is explored fully, while punctuating this serious coming of age story with moments of sweetness, charm, and affirmation. Charlie's trouble with loneliness is introduces at the start but not dragged on too long- he quickly finds fast friends in Sam and Patrick, who then invite him to join their group of friends. The film is also not overly saccharine at all- it emphasises clearly that Charlie's freshman year is a journey, and his unresolved emotional troubles are not solved in one defining moment- it is a journey of self discovery.Logan Lerman portrays this journey well as Charlie Kelmnicks. His performance has been critically acclaimed and rightly so- every nuance, every detail of his performance is calculated and calibrated, to achieve realistic emotional precision. He plays a fully formed, well written character- he is shy but totally at ease with friends, depressed but only unknowingly so. I have no qualms in saying that Lermans performance is easily one of the best, most realistic portrayals of a teenager I have ever seen. Emma Watson, rocking a frighteningly authentic american accent is also exquisite as Sam. Sam very much has trauma and troubles of her own, but she is kind, caring, attentive, and deeply empathetic.Perhaps this is one of the films Flaws. While the film is never overtly saccharine or naive, how the characters act may be slightly untruthful. It seems that all the characters around Charlie are caring and supportive- there is not a single character who is mean or unfriendly with Charlie. I find this aspect to be at least slightly peculiar. Another complaint I can find is that the sub plot of Charlie and his Aunt seems contrived and misplaced. I find the story would have worked perfectly fine without those strange, dreamy recollections of him and his aunt. I should think giving a character childhood trauma is not a free trump card to add depth to the character. Charlie with regular depression would have been good enough.The perks of being a wallflower has really transcended my expectations entirely. I don't normally like teen movies but I found myself really liking this one. It is sweet, powerfully acted, and realistically written. It stands as a sublimely life affirming ode to good friends. My rating of 7 is only deeply personal- I find The Perks Of Being A Wallflower to be an outstanding work definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rebel with a Cause - a very week social drama due to disregard of psychological science,"An author and a movie-maker are two totally different career personalities. It isn't always easy for an author to turn his own novel into a feature-length movie. Even though there are exceptions, in general the idea of writing a drama novel develops through emotions and thoughts, whereas writing a movie requires thinking in visuals and in character motives.As a novel ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" has published by MTV in the year 1999 for Young Adult audiences. Examining social psychology as a subject matter is the leading concentration herein. This novel has several references from English Literature works and Western Philosophy movements. Author Stephen Chbosky reflects his opinions on struggles of an adolescent growing up to adulthood in a western society where the adolescent has to face isolation and alienation while delving deeply into individual freedom as it is the case in Nihilism, Absurdism, and in Existentialism.The refusal of loneliness is the concealed and driven force of being a wallflower. Being a wallflower for an adolescent in this film stands for acting the cool guy, and acting the wanna-be-popular guy. According to Albert Camus, the French philosopher, this is the definition of being a ""rebel"".But the promised concealed and driven force of being a wallflower isn't displayed in the film, which is the initial problem of the chain of other continued failures. The reasoning with choosing to be a wallflower is explained through shyness. If the Charlie character is made shy, how can he easily strip down his clothes in front of a hundred people on the Rocky Horror Picture Show night? The psychological trauma awaiting after committing such a ""rebel"" action for a shy person may be very severely grievous, or may be not. Let's hope it may not.The ease of dialogues and interactions between Emma Watson's character(Sam) and Charlie are also improper with the given character motives. She types ""write about us"" to Charlie's typewriter. And what does Charlie do in return? He types ""I will"". This is just nonsense. Later on she goes to sit on her bed sort of inviting him to sex. The moment as a couple they were about to start making out, as Sam touches Charlie on his inner thighs, Charlie recalls his sister who is dead. How can you recall your late sister while your dream girlfriend makes love to you as she touches your thighs? Reality is that Charlie's character is not directed to be a shy character. He is just a cool but abnormally depressive character. And this has nothing to do with being a wallflower.Charlie is the next James Dean. Everything he did to lure girls, so did James Dean the same way. For over 65 years in Hollywood, being the cool and rebel guy always created more impression on girls rather than being a nice popular guy. This is a huge and inexcusable directing inferiority.Whoever loved this film, loved it because of the resolution at the end. Whereas also whoever hated this film, hated it because of the revelation at the end. The Perks of Being a Wallflower film has two main themes:1/ Finding the love you deserve 2/ Finding the meaning of becoming an adultEach theme is in contradiction with each other. This film offers us the resolution that seeking the love you deserve keeps you away from becoming an adult. And it offers us the revelation of finding the meaning of becoming an adult in Nihilist freedom of an understanding that you cannot run after love, love will come to you.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A movie about friendship, high school, music, literature, and mental illness.","Immediately ascends to the pantheon of high school movies, ahead of The Breakfast Club and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. I saw it at the Writer's Guild with mostly a sixty-plus audience and they all seemed to love it, so, clearly, this is a movie that transcends generational appeal. In other words, it dealt with universal themes with great dignity and beauty.The actors were all excellent, especially Ezra Miller as the gay best friend of Charlie.

Home Run First Time for Stephen Chbosky,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the better teen flicks of recent times. While I wasn't familiar with male leads (Logan Lerman and Ezra Miller), they could match wits against the excellent Emma Watson in a movie about early '90s teenage angst. Set in the South Hills of Pittsburgh, novelist/screenwriter/director Stephen Chbosky did a fine job with his first book/script/movie.One highlight of the movie is that most of the characters are fairly well-developed. Even without knowing everything about him, Sam (Watson) and Patrick (Miller) can tell our hero Charlie (Lerman) is another ""misfit toy,"" just as they are. All of the kids have had trouble in the past or in the present, and they're generally dealing with it. But Charlie, especially, has difficulties. Chbosky shows how Charlie's past problems can't always be hidden, and emerge in some unexpected ways.The movie makes good use of its Pittsburgh location, particularly with some memorable trips over the Fort Pitt bridge. Any movie that can both cast Tom Savini and give Eide's a plug is good in my book! This movie might be a movie like American Graffiti in the future - a movie with an awful lot of young talent in one place at one time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Logan's facial expressions are impressive, he manages to play Charlie without falling into an apathetic character. A+Ezra Miller, as Patrick, is even better, he plays a wonderful person, full of surprises, i think that he drowned himself in the role and that's what makes me even more amazed by his performance. A++Emma Watson has proved with this film that she is not just a pretty face,that she is capable of more than Hermione, she was the weak link, but she did it.

Decent Coming-of-Age Tale,"An introvert freshman (Logan Lerman) is taken under the wings of two seniors who welcome him to the real world.It baffles me that kids who are so into underground music seem to have no idea who David Bowie is.

We never had gay drama, and I am not big on Rocky Horror (though many are), but I can see this.Not a bad story overall, and it is really driven by having Emma Watson play Sam. With or without her, it would be a good film, but I think she provides the star power and the emotional vulnerability that really sell the character. She is really the only big star in the film, other than those who were left to be little more than cameos (Paul Rudd, Joan Cusack).

A real surprise. 2 thumbs up.,"Before I saw this film I knew nothing about it so I had no expectations, I left with a huge smile on my face. I don't need to go into what the film is about (just watch the trailer) but I can say the acting in this is top notch. The young cast is brilliant and direction well done. Logan Lerman - Charlie is a likable quiet boy who struggles for his acceptance at the time of battling his mental health and plays the role to perfection. Emma Watson - Sam is of course beautiful but her acting just grows in leaps and bounds. The the extroverted gay boy Pat who is played by Ezra Miller and he dominates every scene he is in, a performance IMO worthy of award recognition. Overall a stellar casting job and a well written script (Book) is just well worth story to go see. Directing wise its good but you do not get full closure on Charlies mental health problems, not sure if this was done intentionally or it was by choice, or maybe I need to give it another watch to fill in what I may have missed, but if I missed it IMO no my fault it means the story should have been told better.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

So far, I haven't seen a movie that makes a loyal depiction of the reality, it is laughable how directors, author, actor made the representation of teenager, they really need to work on that.

A masterpiece on being a misfit,"This movie is so much more than it seems. At first, it is a generic teen movie about high school. But very quickly it transforms into something greater. It talks about trauma, about love and specially about self love, and it does so wonderfully. It never downplays the struggles it shows but, at the same time, it doesn't use them for the shock value. It does so in a way that's both respectful and interesting and it permeates everything that happens in the plot.
But for me, that's not where its brilliance is. What this movie does perfectly is the way simpler feeling of being alone. As someone that had a hard time fitting in, it is easy to relate to what all the characters, especially Charlie, put on screen. And the best part of it is that most of the very relatable things are extremely subtle. It is the awkwardness of going to a party with no idea of what to do, or looking at people and waiting for a hello that is not going to come.
Still, the trauma is always present. As life is, bad things don't simply go away when good things happen. And so, it is about going through it. Not forgetting it, or even ignoring it. It is about dealing with it and accepting yourself as someone worthy of love.It is a great movie with a great message, which only makes it an even better movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

It is to their credit that they made me forget Percy Jackson, Harry Potter and We Need To Talk About Kevin.

Stephen Chbosky's direction (from his own book of the same name) is certainly not ostentatious, and this is probably wise.

Logan Lerman and Emma Watson perfectly display their ability to translate a real character onto the big screen, leaving their massive blockbuster counter parts of Percy Jackson and Hermione Granger in the past. From the innocent kind demeanor Lerman is able to produce, to the sweet, loving, and understanding senior Watson helps create- the two leads steal the film in all their glory.

An unexpected surprise of a movie,"Rarely do we find a story that is so engaging and mature at the same time, it engrosses you from the beginning. I had no expectations from the movie when i started watching it, expecting it to be just another school-fun story of a bunch of teenagers and man was i surprised!! I am actually quite surprised that it didn't get nominated for any of the prestigious awards now that the lists are out.This movie is enhanced by the terrific performances of its lead players which only adds to the beautiful story that chbosky has to offer. Logan lerman grabs the character of charlie with so much ease and delivers such a mature performance that its hard to believe he's so young. Emma watson, the reason i decided to watch the movie in the first place, provides so much credibility to her character and delivers a performance i would rate as the best of her career. Ezra Miller as patrick brings comic relief in the scenes and displays a certain vulnerability that his character demands. Rest of the supporting cast is well chosen and adds to the overall strength in the acting department. Chobosky's screenplay and direction is simply awesome, with never a dull moment in between. The story is beautiful and heart breaking at the same time and unfolds in such a surprising manner. At every situation in the movie i was expecting a certain clichéd form of response to the situation by the characters but i wasn't right about it even for a single such situation and hence the surprise. Two thumbs up for chbosky and its wonderful leading caste. Chances are that this movie will remain with you well after you have watched it..!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A spectacular movie,"With the ever-growing number of poorly construed movies out there, it is great to be surprised when a movie is so much better than you expect. When I saw this movie, staring Emma Watson of Harry Potter fame, I wasn't expecting anything overly spectacular. I was wrong.The movie extended far beyond what could have been a run-of-the-mill, coming of age movie, to a thought provoking look into some of the challenges that face young adults as they work their way through high school. The movie takes you through a number of highly relevant issues in an intelligent way, with very good acting. It looks at early relationships, homosexuality, mental illness, bullying, and sexual abuse as well as our concepts of self-worth.This was a wonderful movie. One of the best I have seen in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Review,"Here is my review as someone who has watched the movie and read the book.I enjoyed the movie a lot more than the book.In the book, I found some parts too long and useless to the plot but the movie was just perfect in that aspect. It was not too long but it was still complete. However, we have lost some of the symbolism that helps understand how Charlie thinks in the process of making the movie but it was still understandable. I think that since the movie was shorter it was also clearer to understand the setting of some parts.In both the book and the movie, I liked Charlie as the narrator but as a protagonist, I didn't find him really interesting. In a way, it was what made me like it. Charlie really represents the quiet and introverted teenager that he is. He is a wallflower, that's the whole purpose of the movie.However, sometimes I wondered if he was really 15 years old. Especially in the movie, the actor looks older than other characters and so you could easily forget his age whereas in the book I believe Charlie being younger was a bit more important.The minor characters were done very differently in the movie and in the book. For example, I found Sam to be a bit annoying and rude in the book but in the movie, I liked her character. It's the opposite for Patrick, in the movie his jokes were sometimes too much and in my opinion not as funny as in the book.I think both the book and the movie are interesting to watch/read but if I had to choose one, it would be the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

boring!,"Bad acting and a script that lacks any credibility. A high school freshman mixing to this degree with a group of seniors? An outwardly gay student not getting any abuse, especially in the era the film depicts? Charlie wearing a tie so often? Wine always available to these kids at their parties? Charlie the only one eating the hash brownie and taking the hit of acid? How could the fight scene go on so long in the school cafeteria without any teacher/monitor ever present? Even with the built-up rage Charlie had inside, how could this scrawny kid stop the gang beating underway?

Deep Yet a Bit Uneven,"(Flash Review)This is certainly not a cookie-cutter finding one's self in high school movie. It has the awkward, bullying and classic cliché moments but also hits on deep mental and childhood turmoil and it did feel real due to its honest dialog. It was hard to really root for the protagonist freshman boy rather, I cared more for the senior girl and boy. Anyway, the story follows the freshman boy as he feels like an outcast and finds his way into an eclectic group of seniors. Drama revolves around relationships, responsibility, graduation and being at the right party while certain character's inner turmoil surfaces here and there. While the cinematography wasn't stellar the lighting stood out as above average. Verdict: one of the better high school drama movies you can find.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Perks of Being a Wallflower,8/10 - one of those movies that gets better and better as it goes on,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Nice, funny, little bit of teen romance and discovering one's self.. reminded me of Gardenstate","This was a cute, fun to watch movie. It reminded me a lot of Gardenstate where a teenager who was a freshmen in high school discovered who he was with the help of two friends who took him in under their wings. Has romance, comedy and is a pretty good movie in my opinion.Excellent Film! The story is very simple yet complicated because of how much goes on. But the way it unfolds is beautiful and sad, sometimes all at once. While it has its funny moments, it also manages to go through dark topics as well such as homosexuality, drugs and death. Stephen Chbosky handles his story very well, never feeling like it's being forced but rather it flowed nicely and carefully. Directing wise, it was shot very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of Pittsburgh and during intimate scenes between the characters. You could not get anyone better to direct it other than the author himself because this is his book. This is his vision so he knows exactly how it goes in his head and we can see throughout the film, just how much his vision has truly come alive. The result is both engaging and satisfying. Emma Watson did a great job playing as Sam. She is very beautiful and charming. As for her American accent, I thought she did an okay job. There were times where you can kind of hear her British accent slip in and even though you notice it, it's nothing distracting and it didn't really bother me. But you have to give her credit for trying her best and she truly did. I enjoyed her performance very much. What makes the cast so special is the chemistry. Everyone got along so well and you can tell that they're very comfortable with each other and you feel convinced that these people are really friends. It was absolutely perfect. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is best if you can actually relate to the lead character or have experienced the struggles of being an adolescent. When it's not depressing, the film goes to those blissful moments that make us remember the good times in high school. Overall, it's a great film. It's a film adaptation that replaces the cliché mainstream swagger with some painful realities and simply let the audience understand the whole point of it. In the end, it's quite a remarkable film.Based on the novel written by Stephen Chbosky, this is about 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman), an endearing and naive outsider, coping with first love (Emma Watson), the suicide of his best friend, and his own mental illness while struggling to find a group of people with whom he belongs. The introvert freshman is taken under the wings of two seniors, Sam and Patrick, who welcome him to the real world.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"6.7/10 - Flawed, Yet Comforting In a Way","I remember seeing ads for this thing on newspapers and magazines from 2012, wow. I mean, I didn't read it on 2012, I read it on 2015 or something cause my grandpa keeps all sorts of newspapers and magazines and just hand it over to us every now and then. So, yeah, feels like I've known of this film forever, and yet, yesterday was my first time watching it.Btw, never read the book, so I won't compare them both or anything.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a coming-of-age drama film, and it's based on a book by the same name. The guy who wrote the book, Stephen Chbosky, was involved a lot in the creation of the film as well, which is a good thing most of the times, since he could communicate the original ideas from the book the way he wanted to.The movie follows Charlie (Logan Lerman), a 15 year old wallflower with some skeletons in his closet, that just started high school. At first he can't really fit in, but later he meets two seniors - Sam (Ema Watson) and Patrick (Ezra Miller), and they form this special bond together, and...that's kinda how far I can sum the film without spoiling too much.Now, it may have sounded as if there isn't much of a plot here, and...tbh. That's kinda how it feels. The plot isn't really cohesive, and it doesn't feel like a film with a specific, unique plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat. And if I've already started to list my complaints, the dialogue feels quite cringy from time to time, yeah. It's not a terribly written film, but a lot of moments feel really cliche here.But, you know what? I kinda like this film, despite its flaws.The cast is decent (I especially like Ezra as Patrick), the soundtrack is pretty good, and I mean, come on. This film has a lot of moments that feel nostalgic in a way, and even though I find to plot quite chaotic, somehow the film kept me intvested enough to enjoy it, to an extent.The characters aren't that deep (yeah, they tried to make Charlie a deep character but I didn't find him to be that interesting. I'd say that I was way more invested in the side characters than Charlie) but they don't have to be deep in order to make this film entertaining. They're fun, I like the interactions between them, and that's about enough for this kind of film.I think that I'll sum it up this way - this film has tons of flaws, not much of a plot and a lot of cringy dialogue, but it still has some charm and simple-yet-effective characters, that made me enjoy it overall. I had a good time. I'm feeling a 6.7/10 on this one :)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Sweet Little Drama,"Stephen Chbosky has written and directed this adaptation of his own novel. He's made a good film that tells an emotional story without resorting to cheesy, over-the-top theatrics. Charlie is a likable character that audiences can relate to. The shyness, awkwardness and insecurities that he experiences is something many can relate to. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower takes its time revealing his story – and that's a bit of a problem. The first half doesn't seem to have anything interesting or special to show or say. It's all very familiar. A kid gets bullied and wishes he was part of the cool group. We've seen it many times. The second half really grabs your attention as Charlie's issues are explored further and we begin to understand more about his new friends.The young cast all deliver great performances. Ezra Miller (We Need To Talk About Kevin) is likable and charming and Emma Watson does a good job as Charlie's love interest. A couple more roles like this for her and audiences will begin to see her as someone other than Hermione. Logan Lermen should have big things on the horizon after his impressive performance here. He is very good as Charlie and manages to say a lot without saying much.The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a decent movie that knows its target audience. Crowds have embraced this indie flick and its easy to see why. Whilst it isn't anything amazing, it's a funny, sad and sweet little drama that will resonate with teenagers and those that remember that period all too well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty simple,Good movie and this movie just for romance drama guys not for action guys and i like it,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Marvelous coming-of-age film,"People wouldn't think it to look at me, but I'm a pretty easy mark when it comes to tearing up at the movies. With just a little investment in the story, a genuinely sad or extremely happy moment can have me reaching for a tissue to dab my eyes. In fact, I often consider this a good sign for a movie, and will rate/rank the movie higher because I was emotionally impacted by it. As I've gotten older, my resistance to these moments has increased somewhat (possibly because I've become more jaded, or desensitized to them.) But when a movie gets a few well-earned tears, I find it cathartic and pleasurable, which I hope doesn't make me sound odd. I say all of that in order to set the stage and context for my review of The Perks of Being a Wallflower, because this film had me crying more than I have in a long time. I'm not talking a single tear running down my face, either. I was sobbing to the point that I had to pause the movie for a moment.There's a strong chance that The Perks of Being a Wallflower was the most relatable coming-of-age film I've ever seen. To be clear, I don't say that because I experienced the same kind of trauma that the characters in this film endure. But I've been the outsider, the onlooker, and the one who needs a friendly person to reach out in order to feel like I belong somewhere. I've lived my life in the same introverted bubble that Charlie has been trapped in, and I know how suffocating it can be. I also know what it is to love a person despite the fact that they remain unavailable, and never finding a way to express those feelings. While there are extreme elements to the story that make this more cinematic than my life would be, I think there are universal truths (that can touch so many people) contained within this story. Whether you see yourself as a Charlie, a Sam, a Patrick, a Brad, or whoever else, this movie is chock-full of relatable characters.It certainly helps The Perks of Being a Wallflower that the cast is basically perfect. Logan Lerman does some remarkable work as the main protagonist, Charlie. There's an authenticity to his performance that is hard to beat, and he does it in a role that could easily be cold or off-putting from a lesser actor. Emma Watson proves that she has grown into a great actress, and has a top-notch American accent. She brings so much more than a pretty face when Sam that could have been a manic pixie dream girl in a lesser film. Ezra Miller is nuanced as Patrick, a role that could easily be over-the-top and a parody of a gay teen. His performance feels like people I actually know who have struggled with being gay in a society that fails too fully accept them. It seems everyone in the cast gets a moment to shine, and if I were interested in writing a full thesis on this film then perhaps I would take the time to wander further down the cast list, but let's just say I appreciated everyone.It's kind of astounding that a studio believed in the author of the original novel so much that they allowed him to direct the film adaptation. Even more astounding is the fact that it worked this well. It's clear that Stephen Chbosky took the time to recreate his story exactly as he envisioned it when writing it down. Watching this film helps me to understand why it was a best-selling novel, because it feels like a story that you are witnessing firsthand, as if you are part of this circle of friends or are inside Charlie's mind struggling along with him. As you can tell by the extensive amount of praise I have lavished on The Perks of Being a Wallflower, I loved it. It is on a short list of films that I wanted to watch again mere minutes after I was done (and I would have if I had the time that day.) I'm sure others disagree, and some critics probably label it as derivative, manipulative, or even trite. Frankly, I don't care what anyone else thinks, it's a film that affected me in a powerful way, and will quickly become one of my all-time favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film came out of nowhere and slapped me in the face - while also stealing my heart at the same time,"There are few films that I can say that I truly got lost in. Ones where I was so engrossed that I felt like I was actually living the story and along with the emotional roller coaster 100%. This was one of those films.I have to say that I normally don't watch a lot of films like this. I mostly go for action/comedy/adventure/fantasy type films. Yup, I like popcorn flicks. But I decided to give this a shot because I recently watched the Harry Potter films for the first time (yes, I know) and kind of became infatuated with Emma Watson.Wow, this film was memorizing. I got so attached to the characters, and cared about their lives and wanted them to be happy. I also did not expect all the heavy themes. This not your typical teen/high school relationship flick but that's a good thing. I actually cried multiple times throughout the film, and I think that is a token to how well the story was weaved and how genuine the characters were - and also how good the acting was.In the end I'm sure my review won't make a difference among the 500 other reviews, but I feel like I had to leave one anyway because it touched me so much and I'm sure I'll still be affected by it long after viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Wallflowers Live as Well as Garden Tulips""","Great watch, could watch again, and can recommend.Trigger warning: this movie deals with several aspects of mental health, including child abuse, depression, rage, and homophobic assault.This is a very powerful movie. it is a little slow, but it purposely takes the time to establish the weight of the situations, continuously through the movie.It's a ""coming of age"" movie about a boy with mental health / possibly social issues, and how he works through a ""normal"" high school experience. For what seems like astronomical probability, he fails up into a group of seniors, as a freshman, and seems to be make legitimate friends as well as the attraction of multiple seniors.I'm not saying this is impossible, but it plays with the suspense of disbelief for a movie set in such a realistic world. Once you get past that, there is a lot of fun in it, and because its a multi-threading of something like 6 difference people, there the focus shifts up quite a bit and the story stays fresh.I think there is a lot of message in this one, and it is quite enjoyable, but it's not one that you're going to watch over and over.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Modern Teen-Angst Masterpiece!,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the greatest film about growing up/high school in recent years and it wouldn't be a stretch to say of all time. It's so heartfelt and earnest which is rare to find in films these days. The abstract characterization is what makes this film and I'm sure all of us can relate to at least one character here. This film will make you happy and sad and will make you want to relive these years again despite the thought that high school is utter hell.Stephen Chbosky, who actually wrote the book the film is based on, expertly directs this coming-of-age tale. This movie is about a guy named Charlie who is a freshman at his high school and is haunted by past events. He also has trouble making friends, but that changes when he meets these two seniors named Patrick and Sam. With some friends, he is able to experience the notions of friendship and love.This film has a talented young cast. Logan Lerman is a good young actor and seems to get better as he gets older. His performance here is very powerful and provocative. People seem to hate on Emma Watson, but she does a great job in shedding her Harry Potter image here. Ezra Miller does fantastic as the flamboyant Patrick.Overall, the Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing coming-of-age film and perhaps the greatest one ever made. I have made connections with many of these films, but never like this film. This is a beautiful indie that talks about the hell that is high school and the notions of love and friendship and how it can change a life. It's a powerful, emotionally-driven film with strong performances and a great script. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

See the wallflower... It sees you...,"I can't really say why I delayed seeing this movie for so long... Maybe I just expected another coming of age drama with an ambition to avoid appearing like another teenage movie. And I am certainly not sure why people feel like you need to relate in order to like the movie.I'm not a teenager. My high school years were nothing like characters' and I still think it's a little masterpiece. Forgive me if I'm wrong but trying to find connection to the movie by relating to Charlie's or Sam's or Patrick's story( like some people here said is the only way you could like this movie ) doesn't seem like the right approach. If anything, this movie is a learning experience. It's all there. From being accepted to accepting; from wanting to protect to being protected, trusting and being trusted, loving and being loved... And it doesn't focus on just one of those aspects. It combines them and creates this beautifully terrifying mess you have to fight through.For me, this story is an ode to love - every possible kind of it there is.And in the end - I was blown away by Logan Lerman's performance. Ezra Miller is an established young star and there was no surprise there, while Emma was the perfect fit for the character of Sam. The only thing I could name as something I didn't like were flashbacks - sometimes too confusing, although I'm sure book gives much more information ( I intent to read it ).

Movies have to do a great job to please me.Having said all that, this film BLEW ME AWAY!!!I expected this film to be a very by-the-numbers kind of film and it was anything but. The acting was incredible. The lead actor in particular was stunning, as was the performance of the other actors.The story was also surprising and contained a few twists which I did not see coming. Also the actors portrayed characters we've all seen in our schools. This air of familiarity gives this coming-of-age story a vibrancy very few movies have. I also think the fact that the film was directed by the author of the book it is based on did it huge favours.The film was nostalgic, witty and, most of all, courageous in handling it's subject-matter. I loved every second of it and have seen the film at least 3 times since it was released. The film may seem like your average high school movie but it has layers and layers of depth.I think this is a PERFECT FILM and definitely warrants a place in my top 10 films of all time.

One of the greatest young adult films you will ever see,"In this film, Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, is an outsider who is coping with the suicide of his best friend, as well as with his own mental illness. He struggles to find friends, but soon finds them in Sam, played by Emma Watson, and Patrick, played by Ezra Miller. He is particularly smitten with Sam and they go on adventures, showing him what it's like to be a teenager.This is such a beautiful film. It really is one of the greatest young adult films ever, and it's all sold in the main three actors' performances. Logan Lerman is perfect as the guy who nobody notices at a party, while Ezra Miller is great at playing the wild and unusual character. The one who really surprised me, though, was Emma Watson as Sam. It was going to be hard for her to come out of the shadows as Hermione Grainger, but she does it so effortlessly that I think that, although it will be her most famous role, she doesn't seem to have any problems branching out and trying new things.What really got to me more than anything was the characters themselves. You really cared about these guys. You wanted them to just be there for each other through thick and thin, no matter what the cost was. This is a beautiful film about friendship and I just can't say enough about it. Go and watch it. You'll know what I'm talking about.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Letter Reader,"Everything we experience is ours, and no one can change it. Some people say that the experience is good, but it may not be all right. Because we are a very magical animal, we always escape those painful memories and choose sweet ones.
You, me, or a friend of mine, or a passerby. It is such a person, speechless and melancholic. Write long letters to non-existing friends, with a heart that meets new friends. The life that was so bland like water was suppressed by itself, like a long tunnel with no end. Life at this time no longer greets any future, nor looks back at any past, it becomes a futile experience and self-consolation in vain In the emotions piled up day after day, he escaped everything but obeyed the time and kept moving forward.
So friends are so important. If the audience is the person who reads the letter, after listening to all this, they will think that this is just a young boy muttering, and then silently walk away. However, friends will not, so one person's story becomes the story of several people, the lives of several people are mixed with youth, and everything starts to change. Like a conch filled with wine, this book is deeply immersed in the blue ocean of self-melancholy, but at the moment it is full of enthusiasm and the madness of bird's eye view of reality.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly Outstanding,"To say this movie was great would be selling it short. It became increasingly hard for me to find faults in such a deeply moving yet charming tale of a junior and his battle with starting a new era in his schooling life, and thats not to say I didn't look for some. I was more than ready to put it down as yet another lame high school film that will halt the progress of up and coming star Logan Lerman, yet was pleasantly surprised to see him absolutely smash the role out of the park, his performance was gripping, disturbing and as convincing as you could possibly ask from your lead actor. Probably my biggest surprise was to see Emma Watson really step up to the plate in what I would say is a career defining role, obviously Harry Potter put her on the map, but her portrayal of Sam, a scarred hipster trying to find her way, will really set her free of her image as ""that girl from harry potter"" something I can't imagine Daniel Radcliff will be doing any time soon.As all good movies manage to do, The Perks Of Being A Wallflower manages to take you in and for 100 minutes you actually forget your watching a movie and feel like your on this journey with the characters. It sounds cliché but any film that can take you on this sought of emotional roller coaster is a winner in my books. 4.5/5 stars",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A bit hyped, but touching","The biggest problem with the movie is the main character's integrity.The socially awkward nerd really isn't that socially awkward. The script writer have put in a few moments where he's clearly socially awkward, then there are a lot of moments where he's socially completely normal, and even a moment where he's the complete opposite of a quiet nerd.The resolution is also somewhat surprising given his character, and makes he seem even more like a mixture of different characters. Those character types doesn't, in my opinion, realistically fit.Charlie's friends are supposed to represent the outcasts of the school, but in conjunction with the soundtrack it all becomes a bit too much ""alternative"" and ends up seeming shallow - again, in my opinion.When that is said, the movie is touching the ever-important subject of growing up and coping with expectations and self-doubt. The theme itself makes it a good movie. And given the context, the character's interaction feels real enough and is at moments quite touching.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Badly cliché movie,"Stephen Chbosky seemed to have wanted to distinguish himself with a more serious and reflective tone that one could have expected, but he ultimately delivers a sterilized and very linear feature that doesn't bother to rely on some of the worst teen movie clichés.The script unfolds in a false rhythm for about an hour where every somewhat interesting scenes are followed by stereotyped and boring ones. Then, a profound boredom sets in for the last 30-35 minutes which turn out to be a real endless ordeal.Moreover, Charlie's character, who can arouse empathy at the beginning, becomes more and more exasperating as the minutes go, not to downgrade Lerman's performance, impeccable in his role. The rest of the cast is average to mediocre, apart maybe from Ezra Miller that, even though he forces a lot like always, has the virtue of existing.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant in nearly all ways,"To set the scene I try my very best not to watch trailers or see any spoilers to films so I can always review with my own eyes and mind. Today I have walked into 'Perks of Being a Wallflower' with no preconceptions or favouritism.Verdict: The film is brilliant in nearly all ways. It's fun but not, it's happy and sad, it's got a simple story but it's deep. The film is class.Directing wise, it was well shot and the film built brilliantly. The were scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of the city (I don't know where) which made me want to hop on a plane, and I have just heard he wrote the book which makes me feel he was the only guy with the vision to truly make this film come alive. Director (I am sure you would never read this) - Please do this again.Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Ezra Miller ..well everyone. I think the casting choices were spot on – give the team a cigar, the casting was nearly faultless.Just one other final point Paul Rudd plays a great inspiring English teacher – which I don't know if it was just me but the lack of true communication between the Charlie really worked – it gave the edge this film more into the world of Dead Poets Society than say something like .... well I don't want to say.Boomskanka – Respect Paid to everyone involved. It's an ace film.Also for anyone younger than me wondering what the song was after watching the film – it was Lord David Bowie - Heroes",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A beautiful construction about the feelings of growing up, rather than just what happens.","I avoided this at the movies as I - a) had not read the book, b) thought from the title it would about high school proms, mean girls and a Cinderella make-over. So here was The Perks of Being a Wallflower, on PayTv. A tale of three people in High School, with the main character, Charlie battling through a long hard back story.There I was at the end of this absorbing, beautiful film in gratitude for the combined talents that brought this to the screen.Where Stephen Chbosky and his team succeed is the refreshing presumption that not everything has to be explained. Scenes move on quickly, words are spare.The audience has to think its way through - just as the characters need to do in their confusing corridors of life.Every character cast provides such a solid acting framework, which meant there was never a moment when the film loses its pace. For example, short scene psychiatrists are often portrayed by an anonymous name, stereo sympathy and a low key performance in a white coat. But Joan Cusack's performance leaps out to allow the suffering Charlie onto a hefty key point platform which keeps the film strong. Elegant acting and artistic direction bring us parents who let us imagine their suffering, rather than the usual high drama scenes of wringing hands and sobbing mothers.And Paul Rudd's performance as an English teacher could have fallen straight into an overdrawn caricature. Thankfully, like all the cast, he acts with refined restraint.This is a sophisticated film with incredible subtlety, that shows not all teenage films have to have shrieking, long haired blondes or dumbed down story-lines. And by using actors who can really act, suspension of disbelief is easy. It also brings home that successful books, which authors have spent time and care in getting right, make the best translation to film when Hollywood doesn't decide to put a 'spin' on them!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Absolutely Amazing!,"So, yeah...wow! Excellent movie! I was expecting another Juno but I got something totally different. I mean, don't get me wrong; i absolutely loved Juno but this movie is so much more; filled with humor and emotional depth. When I started watching, I thought that it's just another teenage movie but I immediately changed my mind. It's not just a love story, but a story of being an outcast and, accepting yourself and dealing with your past. I think that The Perks of Being a Wallflower casts true light on how hard it is being a teenager.""We accept the love we think we deserve""...Oh, my God! I'm totally in love with this quote. I never thought of it that way but after seeing this movie, I think that this sentence explains everything there is to know about love. And it's not even a love story!The cast is amazing! They couldn't have picked better actors for this movie. Logan Lerman was amazing but I already knew that before I started watching the movie. Hermione with American accent! Well Emma did great and it was a pleasure watching her again. I mean, she already proved herself with Harry Potter but with The Perks of Being Wallflower she proved that she can embody other people too. She was absolutely amazing and I think she has a successful career ahead of her. Being in love with Ezra Miller, I've seen practically every movie that he's made and this is by far one of his best. Make no mistake; he was brilliant in ""We need to talk about Kevin"" and ""City Island"" but he had competition there. In ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" he just stood out. Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev, Johnny Simmons and others were great just as well.I mustn't forget the soundtrack. It was brilliant but I guess it had to be so good since the music played a big role in this movie.I think the message was pretty clear. It was about accepting yourself, picking up the pieces and starting over. The message can also be that quote I mentioned before; ""We accept the love we think we deserve"". You can pick whichever message you want but I guess it depends on a mood you're currently in.So, yeah...I highly recommend this movie since it's now one of my favorite. I think you'll enjoy it the most if you watch it with your friends, but I guess that's up to you. Enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
soul enriching,"This film was so endearing and the characters were totally relatable. The screenplay flows so seamlessly intertwining the monologues and the narrative beautifully that neither seemed out of place. And for once the monologues felt necessary and had an important role to play, a role which expositions the state of Charlie's mind and his inexpressive self. Logan Lerman is just a perfect fit for the role. His twitchy eyebrows, pensive hands, the reticence shackling him from merging with the world were perfectly believable and more importantly struck a chord with me, which in turn, I think, is the most important thing which must happen in order to love this film. I cannot shower enough praise on him. A film which was perfectly cast and not easily forgettable",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fairly realistic,"The initial set-up of the storyline resembles a usual teen chick flick. Much to my surprise, the rest of it is not like that at all.The time-frame for the story seems to be the one when I was a high school fresher, so I was quite curious to see if I can relate to anything I see in this movie. Granted, there are some elements of the plot that are inevitable in any high-school movie that is based on trials and tribulations of social misfits.However, the characters are certainly not portrayed as childishly egoistic as they appear in most teen movies. In fact, the level of maturity of the main characters, the types of issues that they are forced to deal with, as well as the outcomes of typical conflicts in a high-school setting all look fairly realistic.The acting is quite good, in my layman view.The only reason why I would not give it a ten out of ten is the absence of humour. It appears as if there is too much effort being placed on avoidance of cheesy scenes. However, funny is not necessarily a synonym for cheap. That aside, this is a highly recommendable film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Greatest Coming of Age Stories Ever Put To Film,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is directed by Stephen Chbosky and is based on his best selling book of the same title. The story follows Charlie (Logan Lerman), a wallflower, or someone who always watches his life take place all while on the sidelines, as he enters his freshmen year of high school. He's always been socially awkward, having no friends and nobody that really cares about him besides his family. That is, before he meets two seniors, Sam (Emma Watson), a cool, rock and roll loving girl, and her stepbrother Patrick (Ezra Miller), a funny guy that makes fun of teachers rather than the freshmen. These two seniors take him in, and this is when Charlie finally begins to live his life for himself, rather than just watching it happen.This film is very underrated in my opinion. Most critics liked it, but it doesn't seem to get the attention that I feel it deserves. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is truly one of the best coming of age movies of all time. I would even go as far as to compare it to films such as The Breakfast Club (1985) or Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986). This film covers all types of people, from shy, to outgoing, to smart, to ""cool,"" to just about everything. Anybody, I feel, can relate to this movie in one way or another. Whether it be family issues, social issues, or just not having too many friends, anybody can make a personal connection.Stephen Chbosky is an author, yet his work with the camera is very impressive. Although it's nothing to fanboy over, it's very far from bad. No camera angle looks sketchy, and all of the wide shots, mostly of the city scape, is directed very well. Although there's no action involved with Perks, there's a couple upbeat scenes, and the camera captures the enthusiasm very well. I was rather impressed seeing better directing coming from an author than many famous directors can achieve (cough, Michael Bay).The acting is also very nice. Logan Lerman does great as Charlie, especially with the dark background he comes from. Without spoiling anything, there are things in Charlie's childhood that he's not fond of, and he has a hard time dealing with them. Lerman portrays this character amazingly, and it surprises me that this guy hasn't gotten more roles. Seriously, Logan Lerman is a very underrated actor, and that may be due to some of his past films, such as The Lightning Thief (2010). Ezra Miller did fine. He didn't really bring anything too exciting to his role, but it's not like he did bad. He definitely embodied his character, Patrick, pretty well. Emma Watson did amazing as Sam, showing that she's not just the little girl from the Harry Potter franchise. She can really own other roles, much like she did this one. Her casting choice was absolutely a good one.The last positive I'd like to mention with The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the overall theme. The theme, simply stated, is that anybody can be anything. No matter where you come from, or who you are, you can be whoever you want to be. Many other films have given off this same tone, and are considered some of the greats. Perks also realizes this theme, and pulls it off magnificently, thanks to its characters, directing, and amazing plot. Although this movie is based off of a book, it feels very original, and that's probably due to the author of the book directing the film. That's one big thing this movie has in its corner.Now, the only bad quality identifiable throughout this movie is how the film skips around a bit. There are multiple subplots in Perks, but that's not where my issue lies. My problem is how the movie will focus on one of said subplots for a while, and then just jump to a different one, without warning or too smooth of a transition. This could've been fixed easily, just by grinding out the edges of the transitional scenes, and making the switch to the next subject not so jumpy. Like I mentioned, very nitpicky, but it's there.Overall, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the greatest coming of age films of all time, and really deserves more credit than it usually receives. I'm going to give The Perks of Being a Wallflower an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Self-discovery therapy,"Directed by Stephen Chbosky, based on his own bestseller, ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" tells the story of a group of young ""Wallflowers"" a term for people extremely introvert, shy, that avoids being part of or rather exclude themselves from most common social circles and therefore feel a hard time making friends. In this film ,in particular, the origin of these disorders is often of sexual nature, although this is not the central aspect of the story. In the same line of ""Dead Poets Society"" (1989 ), this film reminds the adolescence and the unforgettable friends who pass through our lives and make us ""feel infinite."" Almost like Remy's cooks in ""Ratatouille"" (2007 ), this film arouses feelings and memories that are not always present, but are deeply rooted in the depths of our souls. A love story, a story of fears and insecurities, but most of all a self-discovery therapy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
More than just a story,"I can count on one hand the number of movies I've wanted to immediately watch again after the first viewing.That's the difference between a story being told and an emotional connection being made.I had the good luck of watching this film with zero expectations. I hadn't read the book. I couldn't identify any of the actors straightaway save Paul Rudd. That's fortunate because some actors carry baggage with them that exists only in your mind - I feel like I already know things about a character played by Rudd simply because his archetypes haven't been very diverse, but he wasn't important enough to the story to have that affect my perception. I didn't know who Emma Watson was because I've only ever seen the first Harry Potter film, and she looks absolutely nothing like she did ten years ago. Erza Miller was vaguely familiar but I couldn't pinpoint him from ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" until after I checked out his IMDb page.The journey this film takes you through - first day of high school, first party, first kiss, first date - is something so many people can connect with. But oddly, people who are about the same age of the characters will have a harder time relating because of the setting of the movie. I'm just barely old enough to remember making mix tapes and not always having a cell phone as a teen, which makes my generation possibly the last generation in Middle America to experience those things. But despite being born about ten years too late to fully put myself in the context of the movie, I really could connect with the characters in a way I don't feel younger people would these days. Doing all of those ""firsts"" outside the context of Facebook, smart phones, and the generally over-socialized loneliness of today just seems silly.The connection that's made with the characters is merely the primer for the heartbreak, devastation, and happiness they all go through. If the movie merely made you have empathy for the characters but didn't challenge you, or if it put characters through turmoil without making you feel for them, it just wouldn't have the same effect. Both things have to happen in order for that emotional connection to be made, in order to make the film more than just a story that you never care to hear again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Maybe some other time,"I haven't read the book so the only expectations I had for this movie was my excitement to see Emma Watson since the Harry Potters ended. I'd heard from people that it was 'pretty good', so I saved it for one of those rare days where I was home alone with no boyfriend to protest while knocking some chores off my list of things to do.I'll give it this: it might be one of those movies where you really have to sit down and pay attention to it...because I was bored to death. I ended up turning it off halfway through because I just needed something more interesting and uplifting. It was so monotonous and well, dull...and honestly felt like it had some slightly dark tones. I just found myself being able to walk away, come back, and have not missed anything.All in all, there are a lot more movies on my list to catch up on and maybe one day I will get back around to it and give it another try, or maybe read the book first.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Extremely underrated - solid movie,"To be honest, I initially didn't expect much from this film - I had just finished watching the Harry Potter movies and I was just craving some extra Watson so I picked up this film and I absolutely loved it. And while I am being honest, there is something missing from the film, I don't know what exactly it is, maybe it was a second too long or needed a bit more music, maybe the plot was just a tiny bit thin, I don't know. All I know is, if it did have that extra bit, it would be extremely difficult not to give it a 10/10. All the actors were extremely solid especially the two leads - Watson did exceptionally well in my opinion. You always fear when a actor you have known to play one character acts in something different, you will always see them as the old character - but that didn't happen here at all. She perfectly slipped into this new role and does a great American accent. It is great to see her playing other roles and being able to act in other roles without playing a character with the same personality as your old character like other actors do. Overall this is a solid movie and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a high school romantic comedy type movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A great movie! Very funny, romantic and emotional. Overall- awesome!","Since I was also a ""coming of age"" at guy at one point in my life, I could relate to ""The Perks of Being A Wallflower""'s story, and even if you are older or younger, you will still feel that you are part of this movie. Filled with hilarious moments with plenty of emotional drama as well, this movie has certainly balanced the scale well and the talented Chbosky (who wrote the book, and also directed AND wrote the script) deserves a standing ovation. The casting officials (Venus Kanani and Mary Vernieu) have done a great job including Logan Lerman- a very talented young actor- and Watson, who's American accent I thought was quite good for a British born woman who spent half her life doing a very British series- Harry Potter. Also, Ezra Miller was, in my opinion, the best actor in the movie. He added that little spark to it which gave it a rich and unique taste. I had never heard of Miller before, and I'm sure he will go on to do other great movies in his career. The music used throughout the movie was just fantastic. I sometimes say that the right background music and soundtrack can sometimes MAKE the movie what it is, and including David Bowie's ""Heroes"" truly did so. Overall- A fun and enjoying movie to watch :)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"This is my favourite film and i absolutely enjoyed watching it. I've seen this film about 10 times and whenever i have a friend round i would always watch this film and they too would enjoy it. This film is amazing and is really emotional and it would be something you would cry at every time you watch it. I have read the book and i must admit the book does have so much more to offer. The book will obviously have more to bring that wasn't brought into the film and i would recommend reading it even if you're not much of a reader. This is a film that you would definitely relate to if you're feeling down or low at school, and films that you can relate to are always great to watch. Watch this film its great!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Maybe Known Story,"When a watched this film I realized then this could happen to anyone of us. Typical ""drunken"" teenage girl and shamefaced teenage boy who thing about her all the time.Especially party lovers and drama lovers will appreciate this movie. I thought then this story is written very well.There's a mention about psycho things what happened to Charlie. It was a little bit confusing. But after all we can see the whole story and what happened to Charlie.Getting friends between graduates can be sad... because you lose them all after one year and if you not it will be very difficult when everybody goes on the college. I've got one friend between graduates too when I was freshman. It's not easy when they move away... we will lose a lot of fun and jokes with them.This movie tells a real story which you lived through or someone of your friends. That's why I suggest you to watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A must see,"Usually, when I watch a movie, I always skip some parts because I find them boring. In this one, the exact opposite happened. I found myself going back and back again to watch the same scenes. I would also come back to other random scenes while watching the movie. I was so absorbed by it, so emotionally involved that I needed to watch some scenes many times.I think it took me around 3h30 hour to watch it. Excellent. Incredible. I almost didn't want to watch it as the preview and the summary of the movie was ordinary, but now, I regret not having watched it earlier. The soundtrack, the actors, the way the scenes were filmed. Everything was perfect. I'm sill feeling the aftershock of the movie while writing. I'm just sad because I don't think I'll ever find such a good movie again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best movies I've ever watched,"Introduction This movie is a darker one compared to other movies talking about teens, but that makes it all the better. It is great in showing real problems in life such as love, loss, friendship and growing up. Perks doesn't just focus on one teen either. It shows different problems with all the characters. It deals with depression, a haunting past and follows the troubles of a gay relationship. The role of friendship plays a big part in how all of the characters come to accept most things about themselves. I also liked that this was a successful movie where the director was also the author of the book. So that means that the movie was close to what the actual book was like.SummaryThe Perks of Being a Wallflower is about a 15-year-old boy named Charlie. Charlie is dealing with the suicide of his friend. He also deals with things such as shyness and anxiety. Throughout the movie Charlie overcomes some of his shyness and meets his two best friends, Patrick and Sam. By meeting them he becomes a totally different person that he was. He experiences a lot of firsts in his life. His family life is stable, but they do have their problems. At the end we learn of a past action that affected Charlie and made him who he was. It changed the way everyone saw and perceived him. At the end of the movie Charlie learns new things about his mental health and how to deal with it. He also leaves us with a new sense of hope about his future and those around him. Scoring SystemThe scoring system for this review will be 1-6 stars. 1 being the worst and 6 being the best. I will be scoring each category individually and then at the end I will give it an overall score.Music: 6Music played a big part in this movie because it was how Charlie and a lot of the other characters would express themselves. It was really popular to show how they were feeling using mixtapes. The music that was chosen was relevant and was known to most people so they could relate to it while watching the movie. Also there was a point in the movie where there was a song that was connected with one of the relationships in the movie so it was important to them too.Actors: 5The actors chosen for the movie I think was good for the most part. The three main ones who were portrayed by Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller played their parts perfectly. Emma Watson played Sam with so much emotion throughout the whole performance that it could be said that it has been her best so far. Within the first few minutes of the movie we could see that Lerman was perfect for the part of Charlie. I rated it only a 5 because there were a few actors and actresses that I felt weren't right for the part. The role such as Mary Elizabeth who was played by Mae Whitman could have been better. But overall I think that it was a great cast.Characters: 4 The characters in the movie could be compared to the ones in the book. Even though the author of the book was also the director I feel as if the characters were different in each one. The book I felt was more detailed about them and their problems. The movie could have gone a little deeper with them all and gave them a little something more. Even though they were a little vague as far as what the character could have been they were still good and all had a great message to show. Plot: 6The plot for this movie was great. It gave everyone a sense of what goes on through a teenager's life: spoken and unspoken. It gave insight on different types of problems that a young adult could have and how to deal with them. It's hard to find a movie that discusses these problems and still seem interesting. At the end is when it gets interesting with a plot twist that shocks everyone involved. The movie keeps us on our toes with everything that the characters have to go through. We get to see how it effects each of them and how they deal with their problems and also keeping up with friends and school.ConclusionOverall I would give this movie a 5.5 out of 6. This movie is one of the best ones I have seen so far. It really touches everyone who watches in a good way. It teaches everyone a lesson by the end on how to cope with their problems and also how to help. Even with the ""bad"" things in it I would still recommend this movie to anyone who will listen.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
PG Perky,"Finally! The Perks of Being a Wallflower was on my hit list of movies to watch but likely put on the back burner due to the predictability of coming of age films that aren't always very enticing. How can Stephen Chbosky remix the classic plot of the protagonist having to introduce his external world with his internal complexities? He doesn't but he confirms that it's not always necessary to reinvent the wheel.The writing was impressive from the outset of the movie. Chbosky does a phenomenal job at juxtaposing Charlie's best self narration to his awkward social executions. It wasn't cringe worthy but it was difficult listening to and understanding Charlie's intentions and then watch him struggle with expression. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller deliver natural performances and never let us get too confident in Charlie and his abilities to adapt. The movie evolves true to the title in that there remains incomplete advantages to being a non-participant.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A moving high-school narrative.. great story, music and performances!","This is definitely one of the best movies of 2012! We all have seen mad capers on high school years and how they are the best years et al.. this movie shows a different side of the high school years..essentially through the eyes of a troubled freshman, Charlie, played to perfection by Logan. A misfit in the world of punk hipsters, pseudo intellectuals, sporty dudes, Charlie is accepted into the group of so-called ""misfits"" and eventually comes on his own. This movie deals with the pangs of growing up, the pains of first love, the first kiss.. Emma Watson has really come on her own after the Harry Potter movies and delivers a sensitive performance. Erza Miller just gets better with each movie! The performances by the entire cast is superb. The music is surreal. The narrative is so engaging, your heart goes to all those kids and the problems each of them are dealing with..and you might shed a tear or two with them!

The themes of mental illness, sexual abuse, drugs and alcohol are covered as they are in the book and show a darker side to the characters very well.The casting of the film was done exceptionally well with Ezra Miller and Logan Lerman in particular, who do an amazing job at capturing their characters.

This wallflower blooms,"If John Hughes and Cameron Crowe had made a movie together it would probably have been very similar to 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower'.The older I get, the more these kinds of teenage melodramas grate on my nerves, but I was gob smacked by how emotionally invested I became here. The bulk of the credit goes to the cast (particularly the three young leads; Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller), who at first seem too poised and too pretty to play these broken characters, but once the story begins to peel back the layers they really shine, and consequently so does the movie.For teenagers this is required viewing.

Truly excellent acting in a Peoples Choice Favorite Dramatic Film,"I've seen this film 4 times now (as well as having read the book after the first time). Let me caution you that this is not a film for everyone. If you were in the ""popular"" crowd in high school, you may not be able to relate to the story. Since ""Wallflower"" won Favorite Dramatic Film in the Peoples Choice Awards on January 9, 2013, a substantial (mostly young) fan base cares enough for this film to go and vote for it. The acting by the 3 main leads (Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Ezra Miller) is really excellent, but Logan's acting is particularly outstanding. (Note that Emma also won Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress - partly based, I feel sure - on her role in the Harry Potter series.) Logan did not make the cut for Favorite Dramatic Movie Actor - which was won by Zac Efron. Logan has had much experience - see the IMDb list - including holding his own against Renee Zellweger in ""My One and Only"". It's a pity that Lionsgate/Summit did not support well the theatrical release of ""Wallflower"". Logan Lerman's acting is truly Oscar quality. His performance as Percy Jackson (""Lightning Thief"") gave no hint that he could be capable of such great acting. Emma Watson tirelessly promoted the film, and praised Lerman's acting professionalism. Of course, there are echoes of John Hughes and many others in this film. However, this is no light-weight teen drama, but an emotionally draining experience for those who can relate to the damaged teens so vividly presented in ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A movie for all the ""wallflowers"" out there","I think that every adult has that moment in their teenage years when they feel infinite; a moment they wish could stand forever. I think director and author Stephen Chbosky has created a film that allows the teenager inside all of us to recall that moment in our lives, and thankfully relive it.I understand that this type of movie isn't for everyone, but I really connected with the main character Charlie. On his first day of high school he comes to the harsh reality that he has no friends. The movie follows Charlie in his attempts to fit in somehow to the emotional chaos that is high school. Unlike other teeny bopper types of films this one tackled some more sensitive and serious issues. Sure it does center on the protagonist trying to get the girl of his dreams to like him, but first he must overcome his own shyness, fears and more deeply seated demons.What really spoke to me was the contrast of emotions that the film portrays. You are taken on a journey into the ever changing almost bipolar mind of a teenager. The highs are great and the lows are difficult to get through. However they are common things that most American teenagers have to deal with in some capacity. I also thoroughly enjoyed the underlying theme of music being something that molds us. I think those formidable years of adolescence are the time we develop our musical tastes and realistically that tastes develops into a central part of the adults we become.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
My expectations were very minimal but I have to say I loved it!,"'THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Coming of age teen drama film about a depressed and introverted high school freshman who befriends two seniors and his English teacher and finds a new reason to live. The film is written and directed by Stephen Chbosky who adapted it from his own epistolary novel. It stars Logan Lerman (of 'PERCY JACKSON' fame), Emma Watson (of 'HARRY POTTER' fame) and Ezra Miller. It also features supporting turns from Paul Rudd, Dylan McDermott, Joan Cusack, Kate Walsh, Mae Whitman, Johnny Simmons and Tom Savini. The book is considered a modern classic and has developed a big cult following. Now the film has developed cult status as well and I'd say deservingly so.Lerman stars as Charlie, a fifteen-year-old beginning high school who recently lost his best friend to suicide. He has mental problems of his own that stem back to his relationship with his aunt (Melanie Lynskey), who died when he was still very young. Charlie is extremely shy and afraid to meet new people but quickly takes a liking to his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Rudd), as he also admires him. He then befriends a quirky senior named Patrick (Miller) and his stepsister Sam (Watson). Patrick and Sam introduce him to their friends, a group of offbeat high school misfits and Charlie finds happiness for the first time. He also develops romantic feelings for Sam, who is of course sadly taken.I knew little about the book (although I had heard the name before) prior to seeing the movie and the adds didn't really sell the film that well to me. So my expectations were very minimal but I have to say I loved it. The acting is all exceptional, especially by it's three leads. It's nice to see Emma Watson growing from her 'Hermione' role, Ezra Miller is a memorable scene stealer and Logan Lerman packs an emotional wallop as the powerful heart of the film (Paul Rudd shines in his brief part as well). Stephen Chbosky is a brilliant writer and director and he really has made a classic teen coming of age film. The soundtrack is uplifting and the perfect touch to the film and although some of the subject matter is very depressing it's ultimately an inspiring and heartfelt film. I found the lead character very relatable (in his introverted loner ways) so perhaps the film moved me a little more than it might some others but I think it's a wonderful film for everyone!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Powerful, honest, and pure... you will be blown away!","The longer this movie goes on, the more you are drawn into the characters. I have never felt something so strong from a movie before. It was fun, awkward, exhilarating, dark at times, and completely overwhelming. The main character Charlie(Logan Lerman) is shy, but completely likable. Even though the film is sometimes awkward, it works and flows seamlessly into the next part of the film. Charlie is very articulate and a phenomenal actor. Same goes for Emma Watson and Ezra Miller. I have not read the book, but I felt they played their parts perfectly. The dynamic friendship between Charlie, Patrick, and Sam was pure. I just watched it, and am considering watching it again.

The perfect adaptation of an everyday growing teenager with a grownup touch.,"The best movies are the kind that catch you in a point of your life were you need it, at a point where you need to be remembered of how things were, how they are and how they could be. As corny as that may sound, I think the majority of people will know and understand what I mean by that. This movies is without a doubt one of them. For all it's grown up subjects and rather complex strain of thought it seems to succeed to show what kind of chaos a teenager is going true. Not the Hollywood kind of teenager where the majority of her/his problems lie in a ""complex"" relationship with the parents, but the real everyday teenager who's real trouble is finding out who he/she is amongst a avalanche of confusing adolescent emotions. Trow in the other topics this movie brings to the table and you have yourself a movie that will remind you why exactly it is you love movies... I can honestly say that this is by far the best movie I have ever seen and probably will see for a while! It literally made me feel the butterfly's in my stomach again, literally...! And if a movie can do that, it's a 10 out of 10 in my bookAs far as the actors go, I really haven't got much to say about them other then that every single one of them fills in the character exactly as they should. Just to say it in other words, every character feels completely natural and none of them feel like they don't belong in the movie.I'm not a professional review writer (not that I have to be so it seems) but the fact alone that I felt I had to take the time to wright one for this movies says enough on it's own.

Weird story badly executed,"It started out as your typical coming of age highschool boy story, which is not necessarily a bad thing. The first quarter of the movie, despite being very much cliched, was still entertaining. I got breakfast club vibes. But as the story progresses it just became weirder by the minute and not logically sound put together. Now I do not shy away from irregular storytelling which can be very engaging, if done well. But the placement of certain events in the story that is supposed to get you emotional, just didn't do it for me. The choices the characters made were not logical and felt like just put there randomly to try if the audience would fall for it amidst the confusion that was displayed and be done with it. Lack of inspiration is the best thing to describe this movie, which is a shame with such a talented cast, but I didn't felt invested. Big disappointment for me",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

The film is incredible; all of the actors did a wonderful job with Ezra Miller as a highlight. Patrick is one of the most believable gay characters ever created and being a gay teenager about his age, it was wonderful for there to finally be a character out there for me to really connect with. Miller nails his performance. Lehrman was also wonderful as Charlie paired with an even better Emma Watson as his damaged heart-throb. The whole movie was wonderful, if not wholly perfect, and I definitely recommend it. There can probably also be something gained by watching it not long after high school.

"surprising, warm, funny, moving","On the surface this appears to be a 'high school movie', but it doesn't take long to realise there's a lot more to it than that. Despite the 'coming of age' themes, Wallflower takes on some pretty significant human issues, and manages to do it with warmth, clarity and humour.I had never been a fan of Emma Watson, but actually found her performance here quite endearing (which surprised me!). In fact all of the young cast do a great job at conveying the complex emotions of the young people they play.This film stayed with me for days after watching it.

It was definitely a worthwhile experience to watch; I was genuinely moved by the story, and touched by the characters.50,000 votes for any film on IMDb is high, as is a score over 8.0.

There are two stories, one about high school stuff and another about a trauma of the main character, that make this movie both compelling and interesting.This is definitely not a typical high school love story, even though you hope throughout the movie that the main chars will hook up. It tells the story about love between people based on personality, acceptance and supporting each other's dreams.

Much better than the high school Netflix crap that comes out these days!,"This was a very enjoyable movie. The main strength of the whole film for me was the relatability of the characters. So many times with movies the story is interesting, but the characters never feel real or anything like what my life is like. However, Perks of being a wallflower sets out to make a movie for those who don't fit in and hits a bit closer to home with its audience. This is done effectively through all the problems the characters encounter - making friends, bullying, sexuality, growing up, people moving away, not having the confidence to say what you really feel, suicide, mental health, and sadly sexual abuse. What was clever about this film though, was you didn't necessarily have to have experienced many of those things to relate to the characters. They just were relatable. They weren't rich people who got their dream job or dream relationship without having to try. They were broken and vulnerable people - which leads quite quickly to much stronger connection. I found myself liking these characters very quickly and also felt quite emotional on what was happening to them. This is a beautiful story, filled with characters that feel a lot closer to reality than many others. Great movie that allows you to feel good about being quirky, instead of shameful and trying to hide those parts of yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

An amazing story,This is a coming of age story which if you watch at the right time is honestly a masterpiece. When I discovered this story I was about the same age as Charlie (perhaps a bit older) and even though I am no wallflower/missfit like him I saw a lot of myself in. His struggles felt close to home and because of that the story gave a sense of reassurance. Charlie is a beautiful character and this was a movie of which I'm very glad that it was made.Logan Lerman is perfect in his role and all the actors bring their characters how I feel they were supposed to. Emma Watson is a magnificent actress but because it was one of her first movies since Harry Potter a lot of the critics act like this movie is all about her which I think is honestly sad.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful performances - a new brat pack is born,"I watched this movie the other night on DVD after hearing some positive reviews about it in the media.First of all let me say that Ezra Miller (the gay half brother and life of the party), delivered an Oscar worthy performance and I am encouraged to watch ""We need to talk about Kevin"", now as a result.As for Emma Watson, she is an absolute darling and a complete heart breaker for our poor hero.I am very pleased with the high school scenes and the lead actor's behavior was very believable.The soundtrack was superb, but probably wasted on anyone under 35. It sure was a nicer and simpler time when you made mix-tapes for your girlfriend full of love songs or the Smiths, whichever was more miserable at the time. There were no computers, no mobile phones, but still these people managed to lead exciting extra-curricular lives, as we all did back in the day.My only criticism is the abuse and mental illness all came as a bit of a surprise from a plot perspective. This was glossed over perhaps too much, and rushed through too quickly at the end.All in all, an excellent and profound picture.

Chbosky DOMINATED this book into a superbly acted, brilliantly written, and well formatted film that will inspire many teens and adults. Ezra Miller is once again spectacular as the flamboyant mentor of the protagonist. Emma Watson is as lovely as always. And, for once, I was touched so deeply by Logan Lerman's acting.

Beautiful and Heartfelt adaptation of a coming-of-age tale!,"It's a beautiful and heartfelt adaptation, of a coming-of-age tale of an introverted teenager, by the author Stephen Chbosky himself. It's an affecting tale dealing with acceptance, friendship, love, loss, abuse, adolescence, confusion... and hope. No matter what you went through high school, I think most people will like it. I, in fact, loved it. Adolescence is a time everyone tries to fit in, try to figure out who they are and where they are going.The brilliant young cast makes the movie what it is, and Chbosky so admirable brings out the desired emotions and chemistry out of the actors. Logan Lerman plays the lead amazingly, showing all the right emotions. But, Ezra Miller and Emma Watson are the ones who steal the show, as the exuberant but witty gay quipster and his cheerful music-lover sister. Miller takes such an appealing turn from his previous character as a teenage psychopath in 'We Need To Talk About Kevin', and Watson charmingly plays the character 'Sam', which is much different from her role in Harry Potter series; it was good to see her in a different hue.The side characters played by Paul Rudd, Melanie Lynskey and Kate Walsh are also quite artful.I loved how they enacted two scenes from 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' (one of my favourite musicals); it was hilarious.Few memorable quotes: -""Why do I and everyone I love pick people who treat us like we're nothing?""

A surprisingly engaging film,"It doesn't sound like a promising title but it turns out that it's a surprisingly engaging and charming film.The film occasionally lapses into narration which is probably the only minor irritation. I understand that the original book of the same name use a letter writing device and I suspect that the film makers were rather too fond of the idea.The three central characters play their characters very well and deserve the cabinet full of awards they have won between them. Emma Watson, being the best know, probably has a harder job but pulls it off with the aplomb of a true professional.It's nice to see the gay character of Patrick (Ezra Miller) being portrayed in a positive light and challenging issues of mental health and suicide being handled in a direct but sensitive way.A quality production definitely worth multiple views.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best high school movie since Hughes?,"There is a time that every American teenager must go through: high school, the great empire of cliques, bullies, mean teachers. If your high school experience was similar to mine in anyway, you probably felt like the one watching on the sidelines, your presence dominated by the more popular, well-off kids that hosted the parties you went to. And then, there were those special friends that helped you feel awesome. In a world where the high school film is, much thanks to movies like ""American Pie"" or ""Superbad,"" seen as lowbrow raunchy messes about losing virginity. ""Perks"" seems to take the book its based on and create a teen film that carries the charm we haven't seen in the genre since the John Hughes era. Issues explored such as family tension and homophobia make it as touching as ""Breakfast Club,"" while Miller's whimsical performance and the ""stay young while you can"" message hearkens back to ""Ferris Bueller."" If you miss movies that truly capture what it means to be a teenager.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing.,"Amazing. No words can explain how easy it is to relate, understand and sympathise. I loved it so much, and Emma Watson and Logan Lerman are the perfect two for this. Best movie ever, inspiring, special, never seen anything like it. Would recommend this to anyone, great if you feel like you've lost yourself or are down for any reason. Set in the 1960's, it has Thee Smiths and Rocky Horror crowd-participation shows. It shows all the awkward things that happen in high school- but the depth is so much more. Many inspiring quotes that'll make you think about your life and how you're living it. It was great how the author was also the director of this piece, and it was just so perfect. Words can't even describe. If you haven't seen a good movie in a while, or read a good book for that matter, watch/read this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An infinite movie.,"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" was my second favorite movie of the year after the epic, ""Lincoln."" If that is not enough praise, it is the best teen coming-of-age/high school movie I have seen. Think of all the great ones – Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Dazed and Confused, The Breakfast Club, etc. – and this movie is as good, if not better, than all of them. That's how much I loved this movie. It is based off of Stephen Chbosky's 1999 best-selling novel with the same name. Chbosky wrote and directed this movie himself. What a joy it must be to adapt your own work to film. I honestly couldn't have told you it was his directorial debut based on what I saw. Other than a couple of heavy-handed scenes, this was solid direction with almost perfect tone. After seeing the deleted scenes on blu-ray, I was impressed by how judicious he was with his own material. He made all the right moves. With any movie based off a novel, we always hear people say, ""the book was better."" At least, in this case, you can be sure the movie stayed true to the author's vision.The movie takes place in the early 1990s near Pittsburgh, PA. There are only a few things that tie it to that era: lack of cell phones, kids making mixtapes with cassettes, and having to do real work to figure out the name of a song you heard on the radio. My friends will know that it doesn't take much to make me nostalgic for the 90s – the decade of my childhood. But I quickly thanked my lucky stars for YouTube, Google, and Shazam. Still, regardless of era, the dynamics of high school have not and will never change. Anyone can feel nostalgic watching this movie. High school will always be about cliques, social structures, uncertainty, self-discovery, and the desire to be liked. And that's where we meet our protagonist, on the dreaded first day of freshman year.His name is Charlie, played by the promising young actor Logan Lerman. He arrives to high school, without friends or self- confidence, and just wants to sit with someone – anyone – at lunch. His English teacher (Paul Rudd) finds potential in him, but that just makes Charlie even more uncool. He eventually makes friends with a group of seniors: Patrick (Ezra Miller), Sam (Emma Watson), and Mary Elizabeth (Mae Whitman). We all remember this group from high school – the artsy, non-conformists. They are like Charlie, but have accepted and embraced their outsider status. They remind me of what my senior year of high school was like. After 3+ years, you increasingly stop caring about what people outside your circle of friends think - to a certain extent. Charlie, a freshman, has not yet reached that point.These characters have their own distinct personalities, which are all very well developed; they aren't the typical high school movie caricatures. Charlie has an instant attraction to Sam. She is a kind, gentle soul dealing with a dark past that Charlie can relate to. Patrick is a confident, openly gay teen who is easy to root for. He first welcomes Charlie to the group – ""the island of misfit toys."" Mary Elizabeth is the smart, artistic one. She is like the quasi-punks I hung out with during high school. The young actors in this movie totally own their roles. There is real emotional depth to these characters in treacherous and heartfelt situations, and the actors rise to the occasion. Lerman delivers a controlled but vulnerable performance with the hint of something lurking just underneath. Emma Watson steps out of her childhood role as Harry Potter's Hermione Granger and shows her potential as a serious adult actress. She has a long, promising career ahead of her. Lastly, Ezra Miller steals the show in so many scenes. You always notice when he's on screen, and he's worthy of that attention. They should all be proud of their work. Chbosky waited over a decade to make this film. If he was waiting for the right cast, he certainly found it.Charlie's newfound friends are his impetus for change. He is recovering from the tragic deaths of his best friend and Aunt Helen (Melanie Lynskey). I won't give up the details, but these events have left enduring emotional scars. Chbosky edits present-day action with hints of this past. Sam and Patrick get him out of his shell of self-doubt and depression. He begins to experience life and appreciate real friendship. They do drugs, enjoy music, take joy rides, and perform the Rocky Horror Picture Show at the local theatre. Sam also presents Charlie with his first chance at love. They are romantics, perfect for each other but too inexperienced and scarred to know it at first. I will leave the rest of the story for you to see and take witness. Let me just say, I totally bought into what was happening. I love when that happens and you just accept the characters on screen as real people, worthy of empathy.This movie made me long for my high school days, which is something I don't normally do. It may portray a romanticized account of high school, but we all experience some sort of self-discovery during those years. I wish my high school life were half as interesting as this movie. It probably was but it didn't always feel like it at the time. I find only real good works of art elicit that sort of introspective thought. You know a movie is good when it resonates personally. I just didn't want my time with these characters to end. Needless to say, it is a film I would heavily recommend, and I look forward to revisiting it for years to come. It is 'infinite.'",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I was worried,"Dear god I was so worried... this was my favorite book in high school, rates pretty highly on my list now, and when I found out it was going to be a movie, I was filled with dread. I tend to hate when books become movies (who doesn't?) and I thought this would have been no different. I found out that Chbosky was going to be involved (although I didn't know to what extent) and my fear lessened, but not by all that much. I knew I liked the actors for the most part, and some even fit the picture I had in my head. I was still worried. I had no reason to be, the movie was great, did it skip out on some parts I loved? yes, but the feeling of the book remained. I always felt outside of myself after reading that book and I walked out of the movie feeling the same. Logan Lerman made a pretty good Charlie, Emma Watson was great as Sam, Ezra Miller was perfect as was Paul Rudd. Bottom Line: go see it, even if (maybe especially if) you've read the book.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Perks"" is Hughesian gold","Stephen Chbosky directs the film version of the novel that he wrote, and that personal touch is felt deeply through every frame of ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"". The heart of this fantastic coming-of-age film is its performances – raw, true, and overflowing with youthful energy. Logan Lerman plays the shy freshman with a past, who doesn't quite know where he should try to fit in at his new school. Enter Ezra Miller and Emma Watson, seniors at the school with a rebellious streak and hearts of gold big enough to let the new kid into their world. Through their adventures they form bonds that may or may not last forever (you'll have to watch to find out), and memories that will undoubtedly guide them into greatness for the rest of their lives. The movie feels so John Hughes-y, bursting with style and substance, traits that most ""teen"" flicks of today lack desperately. So ""Superbad"" was deeper than most because it dealt withthe fear of loneliness, the unknown? ""Perks"" hits much harder with themes of sexuality, intense depression, molestation, and suicide. But you'll laugh too, it's not all a sob story. It's a true-life tale about growing up and fitting in, and allowing others to help you when you're at your worst. ""Perks"" is coming-of-age at its best.-Thomas Bond",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

what I learned and felt with watching this movie,I think this movie shows life is not perfect and we all have lots of problems but It's not important.....the important thing is how you deal with them....you want to give up or fight with all odds I thinks this show different aspects of teenager's life with different problems and how they may react to these problems. the best thing of this movie is when you're watching this movie you're feeling(pains) exactly as they're feeling in movie in different scenes and I think the worst thing is when they were happy....I didn't feel happy as strong as their feeling....what I mean is this movie transported their sadness to me very well but It wasn't true for happiness overall this movie refreshed all my pains that I had suffered for all my life....on the other hand It reminded me always there is a hope and a reason that we live because of it....!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Touching drama - worth watching,"There is a touching teen drama with romance, some humor and good acting. I'm not familiar with the novel but as a movie I think it is quite a good story. The different themes are quite varied for one movie: first love, drug use, homosexuality, sexual abuse and friendship. They are not new to movies about teens but the way it's put together is fresh, realistic and entertaining while avoiding clichés or melodrama. Logan Lerman is well cast as the wallflower Charlie who starts high school with some emotional baggage, makes new friends and falls in love. He is likable enough to be the central character and his crush is quite sweet to watch. Emma Watson acts as the object of his affection Sam. She brought attention to the movie but I think she is a bit too androgynous and lacking romantic appeal. Also her diction was too well articulated which made her sound like a fine British actress rather than a troubled Pennsylvania girl. Mae Whitman was suitably repulsive as Mary Elizabeth the unattractive friend. Nina Dobrev as the sister Candace didn't get enough screen time - maybe because she is prettier than the lead Emma Watson. Ezra Miller as the gay friend is quirky enough while not acting too flamboyant. The adults have supporting roles from Dylan Mcdermott as Charlie's father and Paul Rudd as a sympathetic English teacher.Overall this is a surprisingly moving and well worth a watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"It did the novel justice. Watch it, seriously.","It's been sometimes since movies have done novels justice; and I am grateful this one, is.Last night, I went to watch this movie. 8 months ago, I was browsing through a bookshop and I found this book with a very creative cover: The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Very intrigued by the title of the book, I decided to try my luck and read it.One of the best books I've ever read, I was immediately stoked when I found out Stephen Chbosky himself decided to adapt his own book into a movie! What!!! This to me is pretty unprecedented because it also means that the movie wouldn't be butchered by some stupid director! I was again very excited when I found out so many of my favorite actors are going to star in this movie!Okay, sorry for the irrelevant introduction. Anyway, the whole movie was very amazing, it almost stuck 90% to the plot, with the omission of certain parts of the book's storyline, because of time constraints. During the interval of 120 minutes, I never yawned once!This movie tells on this guy, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who is a socially awkward introvert and how his life progresses as he meets a senior, Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his sister, Sam (Emma Watson).1) Charlie (Logan Lerman) - Logan immediately portrays Charlie to near-perfection, as I saw for myself, Charlie coming alive from the book. And Logan just transformed from the charismatic Percy Lightning to this boy who is so awkward around people, it's just unbelievable. He's a great actor, that's for sure. There was this scene towards the end that was so powerful to me because it seemed so surreal; Logan acted exceptionally phenomenal at that part of the movie.2) Sam (Emma Watson) - Hermione is no more Hermione. Emma acted out of that role, she became Sam in this movie. She is as she is from the book, just feisty enough, frivolous, loving, caring and beautiful inside out. I loved how she portrayed Sam, she did not give the character a perfect image, it was like a beautiful painting tainted by forgivable negative traits! One thing for sure though, you wouldn't believe that she's played that smart witch at Harry Potter.3) Patrick (Ezra Miller) - I was excited for this guy because I watched ""Honey, We Have To Talk About Kevin"" and he played this sick-minded guy in this respective movie but in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, he transformed completely! I couldn't believe it when I saw how Patrick come to live! Ezra definitely came close to stealing the show. You should just watch the movie for the sake of this guy.4) Kate Walsh, Nina Dobrev - These guys were incredibly good too, they did their roles justice without, however, much screen time. Still, the few minutes given to them were enough as their presence was felt.Overall, I can't tell you how great this movie is. You just have to watch this movie to believe it. Don't worry if you haven't read the book, it's equally good, TRUST ME!!!!!!!!I'm having several catharsis right now, the movie is just too fantastic. Not to mention, the soundtrack makes you wanna believe the movie is real and the characters are out there, somewhere.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This film is infinite.,"One night, I thought ""Hey why don't I buy a quick film on the TV, one that I've already seen will do fine"" and then I saw a trailer for ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" and I thought, ""Oh why not, it looks average and I might as well give it a shot""... THE TRAILER DOES NOT DO IT JUSTICE! As soon as it began, I was sucked into another world and I felt as though I was going through a journey with Sam, Charlie and Patrick. I could not take my eyes off the screen for the whole length of the movie. Although it seems a rather light hearted film, it deals with issues such as Homosexuality and mental health very maturely which just makes the film all that much more better. The acting was superb and Erza Miller, Emma Watson and Logan Lerman had such a great on screen chemistry which was beautifully complimented by the actors with less screen time. This film is officially my favourite movie, EVER, and if you watch it and it didn't at least place in your top 3 I would be surprised. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING ON!!! Go see this film. Now.

"Surprisingly brilliant, poetic with a powerful ending.","Having not read the novel & knowing very little about this movie other than the trailers & positive rotten tomatoes rating I took a punt on this movie. At first it appears like a typical coming of age teenage angst college drama. You know about the bullied kid who learnt how to confront his bullies & win the day. Forget it its nothing like that. Its a carefully crafted grown up movie about 3 teenagers, & how their lives have been affected by their different experiences. Its a performance centred movie with affecting performances,comedy that is befitting of the characters & some very touching moments. Its a movie that as you watch are unsure where its leading to or whether it is actually going to lead to anything of any meaning. I have to admit I didn't see the ending coming but when it does all that seemed insignificant & just part of filling the movie preceding the climax becomes of major significance & hits you with an emotional wallop. Without giving the ending away be prepared to be emotionally torn up. Even the peripheral characters in this movie in those final scenes take on greater importance & only add to the emotional climax. There's some wonderfully poetically moving voice-over from the Story's main character which is stirring spine tinglingly memorable stuff. It stirrs you from within & completes the movie in befitting fullfiling way. Surprisingly better than you may expect. Do yourself a favour & go see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ezra and Emma really jelled well and it definitely shows through the acting!I don't feel I have to comment on Emma Watson, her performance was all I expected it to be and more, but this could be to do with the fact I'm a die hard Harry Potter fan.I have intentionally give next to nothing away about the actually film, as there a no words that I could produce to do it justice, so you will have to go watch it yourself, and I strongly recommend that you do!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Strong performances across the boards from the three leads (Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, and Ezra Miller), and it's supporting cast members (Mae Whitman, Nina Dobrev, Dylan McDermott, Joan Cusak, and Paul Rudd.)

This affecting teen drama is surprisingly very honest.,"I'll confess, that when this movie ended, I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to say about it. All I knew is that I loved it. The Perks of Being a Wallflower, based on the beloved book by Stephen Chbosky (who actually wrote and directed the movie), really seems to resonate with a lot of people, and I can see why. I can also see why others might not like it.We open up with our main character Charlie (Logan Lerman), who is beginning his first year of high school. He's an outsider at first, but soon finds unlikely friends with two seniors. the flamboyant and energetic Patrick (Ezra Miller), and his step sister Sam (Emma Watson), and he's then later accepted into their larger group of friends. Sam refers to them as the island of misfit toys. Everything is not all a bowl of cherries, though. Problems arise in several areas between each of the characters, Charlie having the most focus of them.Charlie may just look and act like a typical teenager on the surface at first, but that's something that Stephen Chbosky transcends. Charlie, and the other friends he makes, are all complexly written characters with believable problems, their own charms, and unique personalities. All of the cast help with this as well. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson, Mae Whitman, and especially the terrific Ezra Miller, keep their characters from feeling like one note stereotypes, serving as appropriate embodiments of real problems teenagers face.You can especially thank Chbosky for balancing out all of these characters so well, for this is such a rich, character driven experience. But on top of that, he also takes time to properly examine themes. He brings up issues of depression, social outsidership, bullying, childhood trauma, failed relationships, closeted homosexuality, and even suicide without dancing around them. In fact, he confronts them head on.I do understand why people would think all of this artificial, arguing of how things like this have been dealt with before. As for that, I do agree that there are moments of artificiality, but not too much to destroy it for me. Is it perfect? No, but for me, it always depends on execution, and something about this just feels very honest.****1/2 / *****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The term ""wallflower"" simply defines standing out amongst the crowd, while one of the main perks to being a wallflower is just that; being able to distinguish yourself by exploring your own unique talents and traits.The film deals with the many complexities that not just encompass what a typical teenager goes through, but what many people have to go through at some point in their life (death, loneliness, social anxiety). One of the most recognizable words from the film is being described as ""infinite"". In a moment of true happiness and satisfaction we feel infinite, as if we could take on the world and accomplish anything. That feeling then stays with you as one of the main perks of being a wallflower. A unique asset to the world around you. In that moment, you come to the realization of your true potential and the legacy you will leave behind. It is then, when you truly feel ""infinite"".Charlie ~ ""And in that moment, I swear we were infinite"".",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nice story telling and a very powerful theme with a great teaching......,"Charlie's coming of age story in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, a 1999 book by Stephen Chbosky, deals with issues many high schoolers will find familiar...drinking, drugs, sex, homosexuality, and relationships.

Charlie struggles with returning to school and being alone, but he has the support of his friends and his family to help him through.

"The Perks of being a Wallflower (""Class Act"")","The Perks of being a wallflower is an adaptation of the book written by the director himself with the same name.The talented,introvert and loner freshman(high school) Charlie(Logan Lerman) is brought into their gang by the Step-siblings Patrick(Ezra Miller) and Sam(Emma Watson). He starts discovering himself and the world through his friends. From then on it's a journey of romance, belonging, confusion, homosexuality, sex, drugs and self discovery.From the very first scene you will fall in love with Logan Lerman who is exceptional to the point that you will wonder if it's the same guy who acted in Percy Jackson. Emma Watson as the girl who has been used(or abused) sexually since she was a kid, yet searching for happiness or love may be, and Ezra Miller as the gay guy(literally and otherwise) are fabulous.The brilliant screenplay along with the wonderful music beautiful cinematography and classy direction transports you to a different world. The wonderful narrative is an added bonus. You are sure to come out inspired and if you are a writer there is no doubt to the fact that you will be inspired to start your new project.The movie deals with a lot of sensitive issues but the most important among them, though hinted at at several intermittent scenes, is revealed fully towards the end only and that shows the amount of thought put into the screenplay. A few scenes in the middle might give you the feel of a usual high school movie but then Chbosky swiftly shows his class by bringing it back on track.It's a complete movie.I am giving a 4/5 for The perks of being a Wallflower. Enjoy the journey to self discovery.

#Relateable,"Do you want a film with Ezra Miller as Ezra Miller? You want to see Hermione doing a bad job doing an American accent? Do you want to see Ant man as Percy Jackson's mentor? If yes to any of these, that's a good reason to watch. What I loved most is how relatable the characters are, that's what made the movie. There's a kid with mental health issues trying to go through life like a normal kid, there's a gay guy dealing with the social negatives toward the gay community, and then there's are girl who's had a life of questionable decisions trying make it right. They may be in high school, but somehow, as someone who is in college, I found that I could still relate. They threw everything in here, not just LGBTQ & mental illness, they threw in bullying and even a hint of sexual assault. This was a lovely coming of age story of a kid who is surrounded by all of these issues, first hand or secondhand. This film is currently 6 years old and it's still relevant to what high school kids deal with today. Logan's performance was stellar, I think he has potential to do more meaningful roles like this and convey and emotional story. And Ezra, lol he's just Ezra, and he's a legend.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Decent Direction, Great Story, Good Screenplay on Average (Great to Incredible at some points and too meta to too angsty at others), Good Acting overall by the cast (Very believable and made me actually care about the characters, especially the main 3), Decent Cinematography, Good Symbolic shots, Pacing was very good for most of the movie but I felt the ending was a bit rushed as I would have liked to have seen another 20 minutes of it, Twist ending was good, Characters/emotions were very well written and the story and struggles makes it relatable to most of the audience being very emotional/crying at points because of how relatable the main characters struggles were, definitely one of the better coming of age stories told in recent times (And thats good considering how much I don't like these stories).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

When the author decides to direct!,"This is a beautiful movie and was so very candid. There are movies made around the high school theme which give you a feeling that its just another grind of a teen flick formula. But then something like this comes and blows out your mind - imagine characters as fleshed out as the one in Archies comics coming together in the 80s and you have actors like Ema watson - Perks of being a wallflower is of this kind. The movie was so captivating that the audience will become those teenagers from the 80s-90s and if you have lived long back during those years, the movie is very relatable and plaudible. It brings back your high school romances or would have beens ;) - friendships, ..everything with minute glimpses but still keeping an underlying story element till the end.

"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" Review","""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is a film about living life and not letting fear bind you. There also so many more underlining themes and messages within the film, such as lying, being more involved, loyalty, and so much more. It also deals with the complications of high school and the needing to fit in. It felt a lot of these themes are handled well, but the film tends to gloss over some of it. While not a big problem, it would just allow more depth to the story.The writing in the film is fairly strong. Like I said it handles a lot of themes, but again the film tends to gloss over some tiny things that could have made it better. For example, early on in the film the character talks about a friend he recently lost, which causes him to become so introverted, but we don't get any real back story. On the other hand the three main characters are fairly well developed and they truly make the film. The directing is good and I like the ambiance that is created. We get a good sense of high school and the life of a teenager. A really great thing the director manages to accomplish is making us feel what the main character is feeling. When he's shy, we're shy, when he's awkward, we feel awkward, and when he's happy, we feel his happiness.The characters and acting are what makes this movie so good. Logan Lerman as Charlie is the awkward teenager with a troubled past. Logan does a good job of capturing the insecurities the character feels, He has little twitches and subtle body language that speaks volumes about the character. I really like how we see this character gradually changes and opens up. Emma Watson as Sam is the girl with the bad rep that's trying to reinvent herself. She's kind of loud at first, but when we pull away her facade we get a girl that really cares and needs some guidance. Ezra Miller as Patrick is the loud gay friend at least on the surface. As we pull back his carefree attitude we see just how much trouble he has as well. The thing about the characters in this movie is that they all have more depth to them. We learn more about them and fall in love with them.Overall ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"" is a pretty good film with a positive message. The writing is fairly strong, but I just wish that they would have gone more in depth with certain issues. However, the characters are likable and well performed. I give it a very high 4/5, good story with strong characters, but it just needed to go deeper into its themes.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Touching and endearing.,"The Perks Of Being A Wallflower (2012) -I specifically made a point of reading the book before watching this film the first time around and I'm glad that I did, because the ending is not as obvious. And watching it for a second time, it does lose a little something when you know how things are going to turn out. With that said, it also gains something too, because I was able to see things that I had previously missed. Hints and clues to what was really happening, which makes it sound far more mysterious than it really is.I would highly recommend the novel and if you can read it first that would be worth doing, but don't worry if you can't, because the film is still outstanding, mostly I think, because Stephen Chbosky, the Author, Directs and Produces it too. It's clear that his vision is properly realised as a result of him being in charge and I like that in a film based on a book.Logan Lerman, the Wallflower Charlie, is superb in his portrayal of a slightly broken and shy teenager who is trying to find his place in the world and struggling to do so, until he meets Patrick.It's a shame that Logan doesn't seem to have done a lot since this film, as he is clearly very talented and a cutey to boot.Ezra Miller, who I'm not a huge fan of, plays the part of Patrick well. A larger than life, openly gay, but slightly tormented senior, he helps freshman Charlie to come out of his shell by introducing him to a wide variety of friends, who all vary in craziness. This includes Sam, a girl that Charlie seems to instantly connect with.The film seems to lead the way for Emma Watson to grow out from under the Harry Potter shadow. She is great as Sam, who, like Patrick, is definitely not much of a Wallflower at all.What follows is a teenage rom-com without too much of the com and with plenty of heart and a brilliant soundtrack, although I think that the ""Tunnel Song"" should have been something less well known. And God do I miss mix tapes!In many ways the film is actually quite joyous while Charlie finds himself. It's cute and adorable too for the most part. You can't help but feel a glowing inside.As it nears the end there is also a melancholy sweetness and sadness, before the resolution of things and that bit was tough, but done so well.The focus is on Charlie, but each one of the three leads could have this film made about them. I would love to see a version that is made in to three films that show all of their perspectives, because Sam and Patrick have just as much of a tough time as Charlie. It would be an interesting way to make a film, like the 'Fever Pitch' book that was from his and her view.I have no trauma such as those discussed or shown in this film, but I can understand the feeling of being overwhelmed and breaking down from heartbreak, as well as the anxiety when you make a mistake, so this film resonates with me a lot. Not to mention that anything that acknowledges the superb brilliance and absolute divine decadence of 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show' has to be good AND Paul Rudd is in it!I would have said that Joan Cusack would have been an odd choice for the film, but she actually fitted perfectly in her cameo role.Also, there is something in the way Logan plays Charlie that reminds me of 'Edward Scissorhands' (1990). They share a misunderstanding of the world and social constructs. I kept thinking that he would run away every time something went wrong or became difficult, like Edward did.There's also some 'Rain Man' (1988) in there too.I'm not sure why I haven't watched it more often and I think that I have used all of the adjectives I can to describe its brilliance already, so to summarise I will just say that it's really good and enjoy it.838.55/1000.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Typical teen story, clunky writing","As a few other reviewers have said, this film has the typical storyline of the outcast teen with misfit friends going through high school. My biggest problems with it is the writing. The dialogue is really clunky and comes off totally inauthentic. The characters don't develop any real chemistry except for Patrick and Charlie, as the rest of them seem very cardboard - like all they are is a character synopsis.Both Lerman and Watson were ineffectual in their roles adding nothing to the decidedly poor material they were given. Her delivery was deliberate and forced and the entire time I couldn't help but feel there was an over-instructive director guiding her every move. I think that is reflected in most of the performances - forced and limited at the same time. This goes for everyone and it seems to back to the writing again and again.Much more reflective of made-for-TV writing, at least when it comes to the characters and their words.Lastly the music. Even though I like the music (I grew up with it), it was completely wrong for the movie and only added to the inauthentic feel. This movie takes place, presumably, in the 2010s but the music they all listen to is from 20-30 years ago. The music is masquerading as the current play-list for this generation. It isn't background music, it is actually a big part of the movie with mixed tapes being exchanged etc. Yet I think it does a complete disservice to the characters to presume that they would identify so strongly with music that their parents would have listened too instead of something more contemporary. It just doesn't ring true.I'm hearing these characters gush about the Smiths when none of them were even born when the band broke up; it just makes no sense (XTC,Cocteau Twins on their OMG I LOVE them! list????). I think the characters deserved more and the film's plausibility really suffers for it .",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

But as the movie went on, my interest in the movie grow drastically. During the intense scene that was the fight in the lunchroom, the DVD started to skip and pause. I found myself yelling, ""NO!"" as I quickly took the disc out and cleaned it. Luckily it no longer skipped. They did a very good job with the character building and I found myself really caring about Charlie. Why is he having these blackouts?

I shared with Charlie many of his emotions of happiness, loneliness, sadness, love, etc. Although some people might not see this movie as too realistic, the emotions in it and the ones that provokes in the audience certainly are.

Deserves more than the critics gave.,"I just finished watching this and saw the reviews. Yeesh, what a bunch of self involved movie snobs. The fact they're looking down their noses at Emma Watson as a former Harry Potter star couldn't be more transparent and disgusting. They're not judging this movie on its merits. One calling it a generic coming of age. That's not generic, The Tender Bar is, where the kid went through no real challenges. Logan Kerman's character is someone who feels far more genuinely socially awkward than any movie character I've ever come across. On top of that we're seeing going through where he's not just learning to open up, but his life is on a knifes edge and as he deals with a side to him left unchecked. Lerman, Miller and Watson are all excellent in this and they deserve so much more respect. If the movie industry backed more movies for these kind of actors they'd have more variety in movies than just superheroes.

The greatest lines from the book were all in the film and it was built up really touching. I think this film can relate to any of us in some way since it includes various different topics.

Could make you love it more than it deserves to,"Less than 4minutes in and it's so relatable and sad if you were the sad kid in high school. It kinda deals with a lot without delving deep into anything, you got a best friend who killed himself, a gay relationship kept secret from fear of ridicule, the loneliness of being the quiet kid in school, the guy who likes the girl but can't say it...more of the same. There's a sad aura about it but not entirely sappy. It does have one of my favorite movie quotes,""we accept the love we are think we deserve"". I'm a sucker for the lovey dovey stuff whether it's sad or happy so that had me grinning, but this isn't a love story though, it's just the story of an introverted high school freshman and his thoughts, so if you were one you could find this relatable and I think that's why the movie's well loved, that plus from what I read it's a pretty good book adaption.Okay just got to towards the end of the movie with the twist reveal and my jaw literally dropped. Kinda even more shocked because it made sense, if you read the book you might have known where it was going, but the Helen thing was teased throughout but I still didn't have the slightest inclination it was going there.At the end of it I think it's a good film but the relatability and reveal at the end may lead you to believe it's better than it already is. It's well written and the characters have layers and story behind them; and it's believable high school characters unlike those from Euphoria for example. It doesn't take things to the extreme, it's more lighthearted than the topics the film discusses. I think it's best quality is that even if you're of different age or can't relate to the characters, you can still recognize them and maybe appreciate the movie because of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Peaks Of Being A Valley,"If you don't get the title, what I mean by it is: This movie is okay. It has good moments (mostly all of them containing Erza Miller) and some bad moments (mostly containing the other actors).While I did enjoy some characters and some of the takes on high school stereotypes, I though the movie was very bland. It didn't develop the characters very well and I found myself not caring when something good happened to a rather unfortunate main character.Erza Miller and Mae Whitman do a pretty good job at playing their characters, who are actually relatively interesting and fun. Then there's Emma Watson, who I'm a big fan of, but I found myself stumbling over her fluctuating accent and she was a bit of a flat line.Logan Lerman, who I also kind of like as an actor, is kind of boring and quiet. That is what his character kind of is, so he works to a certain degree, but in the end, I really didn't get attached to any of the character's, with the exception of Erza Miller.The main problem stems from the fact that it's supposed a character driven story, but the movie gives his flat, generic characters to connect with. Their characteristic's are too plain and their goals are too simple that when they accomplish them, we don't really care. None of the character's really grow to any extent.In conclusion, this movie is nowhere near terrible, but it's very mediocre. Give it a pass.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the Best Movies of the Year,"I loved so much about this movie its hard to know where to begin. High-school students are frequently portrayed as either nasty (like those who would lock someone in a locker or strip them of their clothes so they have to walk home naked), or they're simply portrayed as so stupid you can't figure out how they ever advanced to high school. But NOT IN THIS MOVIE.This came across as real life high-school to me - a mother of two: One a high school kid; one a high-school graduate. These are young adults (not young idiots like in most high-school themed movies). They have real life events going on, and real-life feelings and reactions to them. The writing was outstanding and believable in every respect. Outstanding job by Stephen Chbosky. The acting - particularly that of the primary 2 characters was of such a calibre that I truly hope they both continue to get lots of acting roles in the future. And a special shout-out to Emma Watson who did an American accent flawlessly.Everyone I recommended the movie to thought it was excellent. Another Mom saw it with her husband, and then went back later that week with her two children.My only beef: I feel as this movie either lacked adequate promotion, or was simply snubbed at every awards show for no apparent reason. Something of an injustice for such an outstanding movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Perks of Being a Wallflower,"Great movie but were some bad Relationships, Logan Lerman's acting was great, Emma Watson's acting was good, Ezra Miller's acting was good, and the story was great, But I hated some sides of the story, the ending was great and sad, I recommend you to watch the movie, I recommend you to watch the movie and my rating 7,5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perks of ruining your own classic novella,"Actor playing Charlie was way too good looking. I always pictured a young Elliott Smith. I read that the director/writer caved into pressure from the lead actor who was originally cast as another character in the book (probably the jock who looked like a total wimp next to this lofty strapping young man) As for the rest of the kids they were an I-Phone away from being typical millennials rather than early 90s misfit / drama kids. I understand that the book was originally written for a young audience at the time who could relate, and it makes sense that the movie would be targeted at today's youth, but the whole thing just feels phony and forced. Especially when they get faux excited about discovering a band like the Cocteau Twins, all the while living in a world where they had never heard of David Bowie's 'Heroes'.If you liked the book stay far away from this adaptation.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great movie,"I personally find this to be the best movie ever. The ending was great and it was just as fantastic as the book. Also, the cast was amazing and fit the image I had in my mind while reading it perfectly. Another thing is, some movies are way too long and could be summed up in about half the amount of time it took to watch it but this movie isn't like that at all. It wasn't too short and it wasn't too long. It has about an accurate take on average high school lives and didn't exaggerate anything to the point where it would be considered annoying. It also was a movie that could suit all ages and both genders and could easily be a movie that I would sit down with my whole family and watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is real life on camera,"Beautifully written, expertly acted, directed well, and perfectly designed, this movie succeeds on all levels. And not just as a high school movie, but as one about human beings.The clichéd issues and scenarios that inevitably come with a high school film are handled with such humanity and honesty that they become authentic. There are hilarious moments and heartbreaking ones and your emotions go on a roller coaster ride that is synonymous with high school itself. Instead of the usual cringe-worthy sentimentality, you feel something for the 3 dimensional characters simply because it is all so real.During one of the best scenes, the main character Charlie says ""I feel infinite."" This movie is infinite because it can appeal to more than just high school students. The core themes and conflicts are all humane that just happen to be set in a high school.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Heavy Movie that has Good Heart,"This is a movie that I remember coming out when I was working at Family Video. My then girlfriend loved it. It is interesting that I've finally watched this since my now wife, Jaime, loves this movie. What I'll say as well is that this isn't one that I've been avoiding. It was one that I wouldn't just put on for myself. Jaime wanting to see it again was my reasoning.For this, we follow Charlie (Logan Lerman) who is an incoming freshman to high school. He's nervous. This is part of his nature as well as this part of your life is awkward. It doesn't help that he's shy. Through different things as this goes on, we learn that is for good reason. There has been trauma in his life that made him who he is in the beginning of this.There are factors around him pushing as well. His father is Dylan McDermott and his mother is Kate Walsh. They're devout Catholics and their home seems happy. He also has an older brother who is off at college and an older sister named Candace (Nina Dobrev). He also befriends his English teacher, Mr. Anderson (Paul Rudd), who guides his thirst for literature.Now at school though, Charlie is bullied. That is until he befriends Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his stepsister Sam (Emma Watson). It is through them that he joins their friend group and comes out of his shell a bit. He needs to come to terms with things that happened to him in his past though if he is truly going to be who he wants to.Now there is more to this movie to unpack, but I think that introduces the main players. What I wanted to say is that this is more depressing than I was expecting. It also is uplifting though to see Charlie reveal his past traumas and then deal with them. He harbors dark rage and I don't blame him. He makes mistakes that brings on that depression as we all do. Make mistakes that it is. This made me tear up to learn what he dealt with and trying to overcome.The acting here makes this work. Lerman is excellent in this role. Seeing him cope with things around him felt real. He also plays well off Watson, Miller, Adam Hagenbuch, Mae Whitman and Erin Wilhelmi. They truly feel like this odd group of characters. What is interesting is that looking at things from their perspective, what they're dealing with is the world. They soon will learn that it is a microcosm of their lives. Most of us have been there at one time or another. I'll also say that in support McDermott, Walsh, Johnny Simmons, Dobrev, Tom Savini, Rudd, Melanie Lynskey and the rest are all good as well.I'll just then say that this is also well-made. The cinematography is good. There are beautiful shots in this and I think they do well with framing. What is interesting is that while watching, I knew this wasn't present day. It is in the early 90's that this takes place. The director does well in giving that modern feel while if you're paying attention, you pick up on this is in the past. I'd also say that the soundtrack fits for what was needed.I'd recommend this one for sure. It would be an interesting movie to show a kid entering high school. There is good heart here that I wasn't expecting.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

In My top 100 movies of all time,"So as you can tell by the title and the stars I really enjoy this film. It's top 100 for me, I'm going to read the books this is based on and I'm getting a tattoo of it.. yeah crazy I know, but here's why.Acting:
The cast in this film is so delightful and they are all equally unique and interesting will real problems and real emotion. Everyone has a story, a problem and a relationship which you just get sucked into caring about.Cinematography:
The shots are all great and have plenty of meaningful scenes with foreshadowing and symbolism. A real joy watching some scenes.Story:
This is obviously based on a book and similar to the Harry Potter books I believe this one is replicated well. I love all the characters and quirky scenes they have as well as the sweet/emotional scenes that leave you immersed in the story and relating from real life expierences you may of had.Summary:
Overall I would highly recommend this film if you enjoy dramas or character driven stories. It's a real treat and in my opinion one of the most compelling movies out there.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Authenticity shines bright in this gem,"I thought this was my first review ever, but I remember now that I reviewed Pokemon the First Movie two years ago. It is rare that I want to take Ebert's position and review a film. However, this wonderful gem deserves it: the cast, the crew, the writers, everyone involved deserves this review.First off, Logan Lerman's character is EXACTLY like I was early on in high school, and probably the way a lot of high schoolers are. As I was watching him awkwardly try to find his place, and struggle to raise his hand even when he had an answer, I was just thinking about my time in high school around 2007. The film is so realistic, it's devastating. For instance, the high school dance scene. Charlie (Logan Lerman) saw everyone else dancing, and he slowly eases his way out to the dance floor and starts moving his body as if he's never done that before. Well, I was JUST like that. In fact, I was so bad, I had this one very nice, beautiful girl to fall back on if I couldn't find a dance partner. She'd always let me dance with her and it helped me learn. I'll never forget her.Anyways, the authenticity of 'Wallflower' kills me. It doesn't rely on unrealistic plot tactics to be interesting, because it ALREADY is more than interesting. The whole cast does their job well, and Emma Watson, just coming off from Harry Potter, PROVES she can do something different- and she does. With flair.To wrap up this review, let me also tell you that Logan Lerman once gave me acting advice. He's a nice person and I'd love to start seeing him in more. He deserves an Oscar for this film. Another interesting tid-bit, is that he lost the role of Spider-Man to Andrew Garfield. The two films were made around the same time. Looking at 'Perks' and especially when Charlie picks up those glasses, I couldn't help but think how good he COULD have been as the new Spider-Man as well. However, whats done is done, and Andrew Garfield did more than well to prove he deserved it too, so I'm not complaining.'The Perks of being a Wallflower' proves to us that if you can relate to the characters in a film enough, then you don't need vampires or werewolves or over-convoluted gun-fire to stand out best of the best, above all the rest.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awesome movie with a touching story,"The 102 min movie, 'The Perks of Being a Wallﬂower' is an American coming-of-age comedy-drama ﬁlm adaptation of the 1999 epistolary novel of the same name, by the director of the movie. The movie is about a 15-year old boy, named, Charlie (Logan Lerman), whose best friend had recently committed suicide. He is an introvert high school freshman who struggles to make friends due to some of his past experiences. So he maintains a diary as a substitute friend. Charlie has special interest in Literature and Music. He is striving to ﬁnd his own niche. Events take a turn when he meets Patrick (Ezra Miller) and his step-sister, Samantha (Emma Watson). The trio soon starts to share a perfect rapport, found out their common interests and the value of each other. The movie goes about, picturizing the experiences of this trio and a group they belonged to.The movie is about the highs and lows of the teenage life. It is very emotional, didactic and catchy as well. The direction was good, with nice cinematography and music, but the movie had an abrupt ending, and a few facts were not clearly explained. Since the characters of the movie liked a certain kind of music, you are sure to fall in love with it! Especially the tunnel song (Heroes). The picturization of the exact experiences of the protagonists were very good, and the mood of the movie is so perfect that you will actually feel the movie even though you don't actually understand it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The blooming film of Perks of Being a Wall Flower,"The topic of mental health in films is a touchy one because either the film hits it on the nose and portrays the mental illness accurately or it is inaccurately depicts mental illness. However Stephen Chbosky who wrote and directed The Perks of Being a Wallflower does an exemplary job at depicting the effects mental illness has on people. This is shown through the dynamic characters, Charlie who's played by Logan Lerman, Sam by Emma Watson, and Patrick who is played by Ezra Miller. Another movies that does an amazing job at depicting mental health in a film is Silver Linings Playbook which also uses dynamic and relatable characters that accurately depict the effects mental illnesses have on the ones around them in their lives. This overall idea of how mental illness affects your actions and the effects it has on the people around them.
We first see this this in the character Charlie who is a freshman in high school who is trying to get a foothold in the new school. While in the meantime he trying to cope with his friends suicide and the death of his Aunt Helen, one solution to lessen the blow was to write things down in order to express the way he feels. Charlie soon befriends his English teacher Bill Anderson who's played by Paul Rudd, and they instantly connect for their love of literature and writing. We are later introduced to Patrick and Sam who Charlie meets at a football game and they instantly accept him into their little circle of friends. At the game we learn that Patrick and Sam are step siblings. After they accept him into their group Charlie becomes more comfortable with his new friends and opens up more with them. However all the emotional turmoil oil he's been through has a deep effect on him and his relationships with everyone. The first instance of this shown is when Charlie begins to form feelings for Sam but feels he can't express them because he isn't ready mentally for a relationship. This shows how the death of his Best friend Michael and the death of his Aunt Helen have had on him. It also makes Charlie to hesitant to open up to them right away however when he does it's about Michael's suicide and it shocks Sam and Patrick. But being the good friends they are they instantly are there to support him. Which demonstrates the effect friendships have on one's life, which is only one of the many ideas Chbosky highlights in this movie. We will later see how much of an impact this tight group of friends have on each other and how it evolves throughout the film. Whether it be supporting each other emotionally or defending their friends physically. However this new improved life of Charlie's where he has a mentor in Bill and his new found friends you can still see the effects his mental health has on him. Chbosky does this too accurately show the mourning process everyone has and how to affects the person whether it be there thought process or their overall emotional and mental stability. The feelings that Charlie portrays Meeks this character very relatable for the audience in order to empathize with him and allows more character depth. Charlie's isn't the only character that has a lot of depth and relatability, his friends all have stuff they are dealing with whether is be Patrick's struggles he's facing for being gay and his complicated relationship with Brad the Varsity quarterback who still hasn't came out. Which helps the LGBT audience relate to those circumstances whether it be coming out and being embarrassed for the possible repercussions or fully accepting their sexuality. Another character who is very relatable to the audience is Sam who was sexually abused while she was younger. This helps those who have also been sexually abused empathize with her and makes the audience connect more with her. Chbosky does an excellent job through his depth of characters whether it be the main characters or the side characters. For example Charlie's sister who is in a very abusive relationship and is too scared to leave, she makes her relatable in the sense that she is relatable to whoever is in a toxic relationship or used to be and can relate to the situations Charlie's sister is in. Chbosky's ability to have relatable characters throughout the entire film helps the audience connect to the characters and his ability to flesh out both main and side characters is a great achievement because some films often fall short of this feat. Chbosky also accurately depicts the effects addiction and mental health can go hand in hand. This is really shown through Charlie who as we've said is mentally in a dark place gets introduced to drugs becomes more and more attracted to weed because it helps him somewhat ignore the harshness of reality. This shows how one's mental health can affect the actions and thought process of people. Another film that does this really well and with similar depth of characters is in Silver Linings Playbook through the affects their mental illnesses have on they're relationships with family, friends, and Luther loved ones. In The Perk of Being Wallflower we see how Charlie's mental health affects his relationships in his life whether it be with his parents or his confidence to start a romantic relationship out of fear he might get hurt again and just lack of self esteem he has during his grieving process. Not only does Chbosky use dynamic characters to make this film so incredible he also uses a lot of popular music which is shown through mix tapes which play a big role in the movies tone. Each mix tape is used to portray the way characters are feeling. For example when Charlie is lonely and sad, quieter music is played but when he's having fun with Sam and Patrick upbeat and fast pace music is playing. This and relatable characters are aspects that make this movie such an incredible movie.
In conclusion Chbosky's movie The Perks of Being a Wallflower accurately and almost perfectly depicts mental health in a movie and common issues that face many people across the world. Whether it be the death of loved ones, coming to terms with their sexuality, physical and sexual abuse, and addiction and those are just the main social issues Chbosky tackles. What's even more incredible is that he doesn't this through different characters who exceed their role and really show the emotional toll it has on them through remarkable acting and the emotions the portray on screen. Finally all this is done smoothly and fleshes out all characters throughout the film making them relatable and also so real the audience can empathize with them. It also keeps the audience in suspense as to what each character will do next or what new thing we'll learn about their past or through their thought process.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

the best of the best.,"When I first heard of this movie, I discarded it like many watching movie trailers on TV would. I thought to myself, this is just another low graded under-budget movie that someone is trying to pass off for a top-charts block-buster, and as a result later on when the movie was released into theaters I thought I was right. No one was fan- girl/boy the next day like people were for the hunger games, I didn't see people in the streets wearing shirts that had the movie title on the front, there was absolutely nothing the represent the existence of that movie. Now i'm the type of old school kind of person who likes words rather than people acting on a movie screen, that's why whenever a movie based on a book comes out I make a point of reading the book before I watch the movie so I could get all the true details from the book first, now one day in my English class we had have been giving a reading list assignment, and the assignment was to read one of the books on that list. The first book I saw on the list was The perks of being a wall flower and I thought the movie didn't look so great why would the book be any different but like I said before I like words, so I read the book. I read that entire book in less than 5 hours, it just kept sucking me in, every word every sentence I ate up until there was nothing left to read and i was sitting there in my room dumbfounded. That book had been the greatest thing i had ever read in my life, its such a soulful, rich, beautiful and truly magnificent read every thing about it was genius right down the last period. After reading the book I drove to the movie theater to watch the movie as well, and the film was also just as amazing as the book, it was all so promising with the right actors the right music the right everything. The perks of being a wallflower honestly is the best book and movie to ever come out in a long long time, sometimes I wish I could be whoever reading this review deciding whether or not to peruse this movie just so I could experience the excitement of it all once again. If you are still deciding whether or not to watch this film I highly encourage you to if your looking for something truly amazing and then if you want more the book would also be just as good for you as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An amazing film; wonderful cast chemistry,"I just finished this film. It was pretty damn amazing. The chemistry between the characters and cast members is palpable; it's so, so easy to believe that they are friends and that they've built a wonderful relationship among one another.Charlie's character and story continually, in turn, broke my heart, made me smile, and surprised me. Actually, the stories of the central three characters all surprised and delighted me because the movie wasn't about their problems or their pasts. The movie was really about the characters, their lives and their relationships. They came with experiences and pasts that were powerfully influential, but that wasn't what the movie was about.A wonderful aspect of the movie was how much it focused on their friendships, without ignoring their families. That focus on their friendships worked well with this movie, unlike most, because it made me remember what it was like, friendships were THE most important part of my life, possibly the only important part. I think that's an experience many teenagers feel in the Western world. Perhaps it worked because the movie integrated their families into the story, like how a teen's family is there and important, but we aren't always aware of them.I highly recommend this film. The directing was fantastic, all of the actors did an amazing job, and I think many lines of dialogue and scenes will stay with me for a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Minus one star for Emma Watson's American accent.,"An excellent adaptation of one of my favorite YA novels. The material was treated with sensitivity, and the casting was spot on (yes, despite the shortcomings of Emma's American accent. That's partly on her, partly on the dialect coach.) It could have been even ten minutes longer to include more of the source material as I feel like we missed a lot of Charlie's home life and how that impacted his mental health. Overall, it was a sensitive, realistic film that lives up to, and occasionally exceeds, the expectations I had for it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
You just can't miss this movie. You just can't.,"I usually don't rewatch movies as to me the plot is usually one of the most important aspects of a movie. Well, of course, this is move is an exception.I have never read the book, so I went into watching this movie with no particular expectation. And it touches me in so many ways. Each character has their own struggles, and however unique they may be, everyone can relate to in one way or another. But what is most important to me is that it teaches me to learn the importance of noticing. It is easy for us to focus on our own problems, and not realizing that others might go through something similar, or that they might need our help as well. That's what Charlie is throughout the whole movie - a wallflower. He notices everyone's struggle, desire, and becomes their friend. As yet, there is not much attention on Charlie, until the very end of the movie where we see the story unfolds. This movie will leave you both happy and sad at the same time - go figure.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A more gritty teen film,"I agree with the other reviewers who have said that this is in no way an average high school movie. While others tend to apply a more rose tinted view or even a version of how adults perceive it to be this film has a feel of being authentic about it.The cast are all pretty much unknowns to me but play their roles very strongly, they capture all the heart and warmth of the subject matter while dealing equally with some very heavy issues. Emma Watson of Harry Potter fame is the big name going in though and once you get used to her American accent you realise what a talent she is.My only negative point is that the film should be higher than a 12 certificate.

The best movie EVER.,"Dear Friend, this is the best movie EVER. A wonderful story backed by the wonderful performances of the trio, Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller not forgetting the extremely lovable English teacher Mr. Anderson played by Paul Rudd. Spoiling nothing, this is a story to which some of us can relate to. This movie has been successful in catching the true essence of teenage life. Logan Lerman expertly plays the character of a wallflower Charlie. His expressions and body language matches the traits of a child who has a communication problem in addition to his own mental disorder. Emma Watson is amazing as Sam and Ezra Miller perfectly plays his role. The movie leaves us with a good feeling about life. No matter how bad things get, sometimes all you need is just some good friends. However this is just a story but for the moment, I FEEL INFINITE.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perks of Being a Wallflower,"From book to big screen, Perk of Being a Wallflower is another classic example of producers and directors perfectly capturing a plot and bringing it to life. With so much emotion throughout the movie, there is never a dull moment. Whether you're laughing, crying, or on the edge of your seat, you will not regret seeing this coming of age movie that is sure to become a classic.The main character in this film is named Charlie, who is played by Logan Lerman. This in itself may be considered a difficult task, because Logan must play a freshman in high school, who is depressed, suicidal, and love struck by a fellow student—a senior—named Sam. Lerman perfectly captures this portrayal, not only with his facial expressions, but with his tone as well. He goes from the sad and depressing voice we hear when he is by himself or writing a letter to his 'friend', to the shy and nervous voice we hear when he is around Sam and his other friends.A lot of it is not just the acting, but also what the actors are saying. There are so many deep thoughts and conversations captured in this film, and I felt as though I was included in many of these conversations. The actors not only made me believe what they were saying, but they made me feel it—like when Charlie so nonchalantly comments about his best friend who committed suicide—it felt real. Although some people may see him as the crazy freshman who spent time in a mental institute, we know from his conversations with his 'friend' that he is very intellectual and he is trying to get better.Charlie has more emotions than anyone in this whole movie, and I can tell this just by what he says and how he says it. There is a scene where Charlie is in the school cafeteria when he suddenly spots his friend Patrick being beat up. We see a short clip of Charlie raising his fist to punch a guy in the face, then it cuts to everyone staring at Charlie, who now has a bruised hand. Before he walks away, Charlie calmly and firmly says 'If you touch my friends again, I'll blind you'. Even though he has not spoken to them in weeks, this may be one of the most powerful moments in the film.There aren't very many places that we see the characters multiple times in the movie, except Charlie in his bedroom. Otherwise we can see our stars either at a restaurant, at a house party, in the cafeteria, wood shop class, football stadium, etc There are so many different sets, but each one contributes something new to the movie. As far as originality goes, the only movies I have ever seen about typical high schoolers—doing drugs, going to parties, having sex—have all just done nothing but criticize it. This movie is able to accurately capture the real struggles and pressures of a stereotypical high school experience. We know that not every student goes through these problems, but through this film we are almost able to experience that without feeling like we are being lectured that it is such a bad thing, and that we will go to hell if any of that stuff happens in our life.We must not let the fear of mainstream high school sitcoms cloud our willingness to see this one. As quoted by Urban Dictionary, 'wallflower' is defined as ""A type of loner. Often a very interesting person if someone talks to them."" So just from the title of the movie, you can tell that Charlie will not just be bandwagoning his way through freshman year, and the rest of high school.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beyond social school problems,"With excellent acts by the main trio (Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller) The Perks of Being a Wallflower not only talks about bulling at school, but it succeeds in attempting to transmit the feeling of a character completely shy and disturbed by his past.

"The Only Perk, was the End...","It's not a fun movie. There was a reason this was so far down the watchlist but I didn't know why until I started watching. Full of teen angst and far too much partying and drinking, it paints the picture of a misunderstood-but-accepted-as-they-are part of society.It spends far too much time glorifying mental illnesses without any clear solutions. Or just plain out acceptance of immorality. Sets up religion to look not much different than a cult.Now I know this movie came out some time ago but I still see elements of this unnecessary drama unfolding today. It's no wonder kids have no sense of direction... the moral ambiguity of such a life combined with growing up too fast only leads to confusion.Then substance abuse, people abuse, and death. Unnecessary trauma brought on by consistently worst choices.""Let's go be psychos together"" literally being a direct quote.

Profound Social Impact,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower came recommended to me by a friend after I revelled in the watching of The Spectacular Now. My limited knowledge of the book led me to believe it would be the standard introvert kid turned popular high school socialite, like many a title before it. However, the film presented me with a tortured protagonist who finds his place amongst another bunch of misfits. It is the relationship of this band of friends, which is so expertly interwoven with the main storyline that captured my imagination. These relationships, coupled with an excellent soundtrack, helped me to reach a profound examination of society; a realisation that despite our own self-doubts, that we are part of a society where everyone has their own issues. It is in no way a life- changing film, but it is one that will leave you contemplating your own social decisions.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A pleasantly different college movie,"There was a time when virtually all college shows or movies were based on himbos/bimbos vs. nerds, how to get laid / lose virginity, how to deal with boredom when/if you come from a rich family etc. The teen performers were cute and ugly, respectively, at it was stressed by ""blond"" or ""wise"" dialogs. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is totally different: warmhearted and realistic plot, switch of sad and glad, coping with introversion within company, influence of childhood to teen and adult years. The cast is also nice and even, no ordinary cute and empty faces, characters are finished in a gifted manner. Logan Lerman as the leading character Charlie is brilliant; he will likely follow River Phoenix' and Anton Yeltchin's footsteps. Emma Watson as Sam and Ezra Miller as Patrick are great as well.Thus, this movie is highly recommended to all giving odds to inner depth and feelings rather than exterior popularity.

'We accept the love we think we deserve.',"This is one of the most emotional films I have seen in years. The casting of the three main characters is so perfect that you cannot imagine anyone else playing any of those parts. The power and truth and nakedness of the main performances is heart-rending. It is rare to see anyone reveal so much in front of a camera, and it reminds me of Marilu Parolini baring her soul so totally in the documentary CHRONICLE OF A SUMMER (1961, see my review). The most astounding performance of all is from Ezra Miller, and perhaps the reason why he is able to convey the torment of his character as a gay boy so well is that he had publicly admitted that he is himself gay, so presumably he had some unfortunate experiences of his own to draw upon. As for Emma Watson, who'd've thunkit? One minute she's a cute child doing magic tricks with witches and before you can blink, there she is, a young woman with all kinds of complex feelings and torments. She is most extraordinary in her role, and she will doubtless have a long and brilliant career in front of her for the next, shall we say sixty, years? For who will ever tire of her? And then there is Logan Lerman, who has his own problems being shy, a wallflower (hence the title), inarticulate, and lacking in confidence. He too is marvellous in his part. The three characters all suffer from extreme early traumas, especially Lerman and Watson, and suffer every day quietly behind their facades, or in the cases of Watson and Miller, perhaps not so quietly, as they are superficially wild extroverts attempting to mask their isolation and desperation behind extremes of bravado. All three actors had early experience in front of the camera and are able to ignore its presence, so one can say the casting was as perfect as it gets. The three and their immediate friends all consider themselves the misfits in the local high school in Pennsylvania, where this film is set. Lerman at first is too shy to speak, and hides in corners, but Miller and Watson 'discover' and adopt him, so he opens up and begins living. Lerman is in his first year and the others are in their last year, so in the latter part of the film where Lerman is left alone at the beginning of his second year and feels abandoned certainly rang bells with me, as a similar thing happened to me after my first year at university, most of my friends having been several years older than myself and then they suddenly vanished like the mist. The film was so evocative that I had some very sad moments indeed remembering that same sense of abandonment which Lerman goes through, and which I had long ago suppressed from my own experience. To be 'the only one left' anywhere is a devastating thing to go through. A friend of mine who lived to be 105 brought it all home to me most powerfully by saying to me wistfully when he was only in his 90s that everyone who had been a 'lifelong' close friend of his had died at least 25 years before, including his wife, and there had not been any 'old friend' of his alive to talk to for more than a quarter of a century. So I guess that's worse than Logan Lerman's predicament. This film is based on a novel and screenplay by Stephen Chbosky (I suppose that's Polish and was originally Chboski, since Polish names don't end in 'y'; the 'ch' would be breathed at the back of the palate and not pronounced hard). Chbosky directs the film himself, and it is so intense and 'real' that it is clear that no one else could have done it with the necessary authenticity. And he is a really brilliant director in any case. He is presumably the basis for Lerman's character, and Chbosky himself comes from Pennsylvania. One wonders and dreads to think what became of 'his' Watson and Miller, the real ones he must have known, and whether they made it or not. Deep underneath all the manufactured merriment, these characters are really suffering. The way this is portrayed is a genuine contribution to showing real and true psychological dilemmas on the screen for a mass audience, which normally sees wholly artificial character situations in contrived stories. This film is so real you can step right through the screen and hold their hands, and they need it. I take all my hats off to Stephen Chbosky. He is really one of the best American filmmakers now. What a delight, and what a heartache. And the last scene is perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Timeless Tale of Belonging,"""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" is pure magic. Just finished my fourth viewing, fresh off reading the book for the first time. This movie is easily one of my all-time favorites. Everything about it resonates: the story, the acting, the music. It's so beautifully done and emotionally powerful. I cry every single time. A truly special film that captures the awkwardness and beauty of adolescence, and what it means to be human. It's a reminder of the importance of connection and finding your place.

Strains Reason & Credibility,"Just another teen movie where all the characters act and talk like mature adults. Dialogue delivered in such a wooden fashion as to make the stacks of 2 by 4's at the local lumberyard seem like the pinnacle of charisma. The scenes this movie asks the viewer to swallow are beyond asinine. The real world doesn't resemble this movie or the characters in any fashion. Sure it's an attractive cast with everyone dressed like models in perfect houses and expensive cars. It's not even capable to enjoy this as a lighthearted escape because it's just so insulting to the intelligence. Falls into predictable nonsense pretty early on. Emma is a beauty, no doubt. Rubb is thoroughly unconvincing as a scholarly mentor. Dialogue, in addition to being delivered horribly, is contrived, preachy and inane. The praise heaped upon this dung pile is confounding beyond reason. It reeks of mediocrity. 3 stars for, well.....not sure really. Guess I'm just feeling generous. The soundtrack weighs things down unnecessarily as well. Realy stinko mess with a polished/glib pretense. The backstory with a deceased family member is a go nowhere drag too.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good film.,"I don't like the romance film, and I didn't expect many from this film. I was wrong. I really love this film, and it is explained by number of reasons. Firstly, the story is interesting, it tokes yout attention by way of telling: mixing nowadays evenrs with flashbacks from the past of main character. It looks like good detective, you understand the reason of main character's behaviour step by step. Secondly, the cast is awesome, I think it's my favourite aspect of film, pair of Ezra Miller and Emma Watson is best part of the film.

One pf the best high school movie,"I had the pleasure of seeing Perks Of Being A Wallflower at Arclight Cinemas in LA yesterday and it was definitely worth the one hour drive.The story is very simple yet complicated because of how much goes on. But the way it unfolds is beautiful and sad, sometimes all at once. While it has its funny moments, it also manages to go through dark topics as well such as homosexuality, drugs and death. Stephen Chbosky handles his story very well, never feeling like it's being forced but rather it flowed nicely and carefully.Directing wise, it was shot very well. The cinematography is gorgeous, especially the scenes where the camera overlooks the skyline of Pittsburgh and during intimate scenes between the characters. You could not get anyone better to direct it other than the author himself because this is his book. This is his vision so he knows exactly how it goes in his head and we can see throughout the film, just how much his vision has truly come alive. The result is both engaging and satisfying.Same thing with the writing. The dialogue is very honest and beautifully well written. It was very fun to quote along with the movie. Not just the writing but the overall tone of the film reminds me a little bit of John Hughes' work. Adapting a epistolary book into a film is incredibly challenging but Mr. Chbosky did a fine job of translating it into a film.The musical score is done by Michael Brook who's also responsible for Into The Wild, another favorite of mine, and he did a very good job. In fact, one of the scores made me cry because of how it emotionally resonated with the scene it was fitting in. The soundtrack is awesome. Along with Mr. Chbosky, Alexandra Patsavas, who's also the music supervisor for The OC, did a great job of picking out the songs and treated it as if it were a mix tape.Logan Lerman, my god, he did a masterful job as Charlie. The character literally jumped out of the book and made its way onto the big screen. Logan's performance blew me away. He did such an amazing job portraying the embodiment of Charlie through his expressions, his emotions, his movements, everything! So perfectly cast. The last 10 minutes of the movie alone is awards worthy because it really shows how talented he really is. I fell in love with his performance. So perfect in every way.Emma Watson did a great job playing as Sam. She is very beautiful and charming. As for her American accent, I thought she did an okay job. There were times where you can kind of hear her British accent slip in and even though you notice it, it's nothing distracting and it didn't really bother me. But you have to give her credit for trying her best and she truly did. I enjoyed her performance very much.The second standout of the film is Ezra Miller! He plays Patrick, a gay character who's not afraid of who he is and Ezra portrays him amazingly well. I've seen almost all of his work, and he's becoming a great actor who's very rare in the sense that he's brave and daring in contrast to the roles he has previously played. He steals every line and scene he's in, becoming the comic relief. But even so, Patrick has his own personal problem and this is where Ezra Miller proves once again just how great of an actor he is.Everyone else in their supporting roles all have their moments. Nina Dobrev, who plays Candance aka Charlie's sister, did a good job. Mae Whitman as Mary Elizabeth was hilarious. Adam Hagenbuch as Bob was great. Erin Wilhelmi as Alice, Johnny Simmons as Brad and Nicholas Braun as Derek were all fine.What makes the cast so special is the chemistry. Everyone got along so well and you can tell that they're very comfortable with each other and you feel convinced that these people are really friends. It was absolutely perfect.I love this movie. It's amazing. And I'm not just saying this because I'm a die-hard fan of the book. It has a great script, great cast, it's well directed, awesome soundtrack and undeniable strong performances. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower may not be the most faithful adaptation but the spirit of the story is still there and it does great justice to the book. This is one of the best coming of age movies I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"And in this moment, I swear, we are part of eternity","A profoundly moving film, rich in emotion, with a stunning soundtrack and outstanding performances by the cast. Director Stephen Chbosky masterfully brings his own book to life, capturing every nuance of the characters' experiences and emotions.The story delves into the turbulent lives of its three protagonists, each facing their own challenges - adolescence, high school, college, love and friendship, personal and family struggles, a difficult past, and an uncertain future. Yet, despite the weight of these themes, they find their place in the world and the people who truly resonate with their souls. The film courageously addresses complex topics, making it a profound experience that might not appeal to everyone. Some viewers may not fully grasp its depth or appreciate the piercing performances. But remarkably, it leaves no bitter aftertaste. Instead, it stirs reflection, evokes memories of the past, or reminds some of similar moments in their own lives. Ultimately, it inspires hope, a renewed joy for life, and faith in a brighter future. The music, beautifully intertwined with the narrative, plays a significant role in this uplifting effect. I even found myself adding the film's soundtrack to my collection - it's truly exceptional.The casting for the lead roles is nothing short of brilliant. Emma Watson delivers a performance that is both powerful and multifaceted. Though she shone in Harry Potter, she has long since outgrown her Hermione persona, proving herself to be a remarkable actress beyond the wizarding world. Her portrayal of Sam is one of the film's highlights - a delightfully nuanced and captivating performance.Logan Lerman's dedication to his role as Charlie is evident, having spent weeks in solitude to prepare for the character. He portrays the quiet, introspective boy grappling with unresolved psychological issues with astonishing authenticity - a performance that resonates on every level. Capturing all of Charlie's emotions in a single viewing is almost impossible; Lerman's expressive face and subtle shifts in emotion demand attention. Each reaction feels so genuine that it lingers in the mind, inviting multiple rewatches to fully absorb the intricacies of his performance. In my opinion, this is one of Lerman's finest roles to date.Ezra Miller, a revelation in this film, delivers an unforgettable performance as Patrick. Words can hardly do justice to his portrayal - vibrant, witty, soulful, kind, resilient, and endlessly fascinating. Patrick is brought to life with such depth and charm that it's impossible not to fall in love with the character.Humor runs through the film like a thread, sometimes overt, sometimes subtle and barely perceptible, but always present. Many of the characters' lines are so memorable that they could easily find a place in your personal repertoire, ready to bring warmth or levity to the right moment in life.This film is a true gem, with the three leads delivering extraordinary performances, supported by a strong ensemble cast. Mae Whitman (Mary Elizabeth), Paul Rudd (Mr. Anderson), and Joan Cusack (the doctor) each bring their characters to life with remarkable skill. And the soundtrack - perfectly curated and seamlessly woven into the story - elevates the film to even greater heights.An intelligent, powerful, and deeply moving film, I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very good teen movie,"This movie has been on my list for quite awhile. After finally getting around to it I can finally say that I was totally whelmed watching it. It's not the best teen drama ever made, but it is a well made book adaptation that I would argue does justice to the source material. The characters are well written and relatable and the subject matter can go from painfully awkward, to heartwarming, to tear jerking in just the matter of minutes. This movie does a great job depicting heavy issues like mental illness and sexual abuse. I have no complaints about the acting, I'll give Charlie's family a shoutout considering I thought they killed the few scenes they got. They feel like a real family that genuinely cares about each other, this goes a long way in selling the movie for me. Nina Dobrev and Zane Holtz in particular stand out as under appreciated, they do a great job in the smaller supporting roles they have. Often times we miss when people are struggling and can't comprehend what they've been through, which is why a strong system of support is so important. Looking around the internet it is evident that this movie has helped a lot of people, and it's easy to see why. I would argue that this alone justifies it's existence.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Logan Lerman as Charlie has done tremendous work- you feel for him, has those innocent cute eyes and expression all the time. Emma Watson as Sam was fantastic, and so was Ezra Miller as Patrick.

So the story is about a young boy who had to face the cruelity of being a high school student..the movie had some sad and emotional parts and at the same time some good moments which made it a good one .I love it because it has got someusic and sometimes the cinemagraphy which was insanely good and also I think the cutting were a spot .I think the perks of being a wallflower is a good movie to watch with family and friends it's a top tier for real.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Feel Good Teen Flick,"Socially troubled, Shy Charlie joins the high school as freshmen and befriends with seniors Patrick and Sam and they really changes his life. Haunted by the past, Charlie falls in love with Sam eventually. And the story goes on with an unexpected twist. A well made teen flick and i was very happy to recall my memories of my yesteryear mainly the late 90s where the friends chats each other (not through mobile phones), compile the songs through Audio Tapes, writing letters, reading books. wow.. that was really a call from the past. Emma Watson, she was the main attraction.. She was really cute and mesmerizing. Logan Lerman who portrayed the central character was absolute delight, he totally acted out as a good, troubled teenager who thinks that he can never mingle with the society especially the school. But he was not a kisser :P Patrick played by Ezra Miller (googled to find the name) also did his part in a good way. All the other supporting characters portrayed by the famous actors like Paul Rudd, Mae Whitman, etc was adequate. The slow mellowed background score was nice with some good soothing songs here and there also added the garnish. Well Narrated and nicely executed of the adapted epistolary of the same name by the author ""Stephen Chbosky"". Well, if you are looking for something fresh and feel good one This one is a nice pick.. Go for it 8.3 on 10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
i don't like drama and i loved it,"Hit too close to home so I can't watch it again but great job on all accounts... the harry potter girl is as beautiful and intelligent as ever. The movie over all is hopeful yet sad. Aspects of each character I know in others as well as myself, gives a real feel for all of them. Honestly I hate dramas most of the time but the fair few that make it through can be amazing. There is little I can say without giving stuff away and to much relates to my life. Shows a bit about a current generation dealing with problems that have been around along time. Give it a watch if you don't mind a little cry with a small smile. I know a 10 is a bit much but it's rare to find a newer high rated movie that doesn't get it just for looks, the story is what touches and engages you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Blown away.,"A good sound track in a film in my opinion can make a good movie great and this film takes it a step further making a great movie near perfect. the film does a poor job of making it completely clear what year it takes place in and I had to google it to check after a famous David Bowie song came on and none of the characters had heard it before or knew who it was.I can't say if its the direction or the acting or a combination of both, but i felt as the characters did in every major plot point. Few films have made me feel this many emotions in a hour and forty-five minutes.I have never felt compelled to write a review about a film before and perhaps its simply to do with the fact that i went into this film with low exceptions and came out singing its praises but I was truly blown away.My only compliant is that i was taken out of the film every once and a while because I kept having to pause the film to google the cast as i kept recognising a lot of the cast but couldn't say from where. this includes the main actor being Percy Jackson in the film of the same name ""Patrick"" being the flash in justice league and of course Emma Watson and Paul Rudd among others.In conclusion this is a must see.

"Rather bland, albeit somewhat original take on a known story","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a coming of age story where introverted, shy, 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) enters high-school, and meets some new friends.Truthfully, there's a whole bunch of movies like this out already, and this one doesn't seem to be adding that much originality to the table. All the standard high-school-based movie scenes come by: Boy is bullied, boy meets friends, boy meets girl, boy goes to high-school dance, boy tries drugs, boy has first kiss, boy has relationship trouble, boy has serious mental issues. Oh OK, so the last one is sort of different.Without spoiling any of the plot, Charlie has some psychological difficulties, and we learn about their origins in flashbacks (how original). The whole set-up is rather bland. Truthfully, the entire plot is rather bland. There seems to be almost no character development within the story at all. Aside from Charlie none of the other characters change in any significant way from the initial impressions we get of them at the start of the movie. And yes, Charlie finds some friends, and perhaps becomes less of a recluse, but he reverts back to his old self by the end of the movie, making the entire ordeal feel somewhat aimless.There is no purpose to the plot. There is a beginning, a middle, and an end, but nothing truly noteworthy happens anywhere within that time. This is just a story of a kid, and his first year of high- school. Thing is, we all know this story, because we have all been there ourselves.Admittedly, there are definite strong points within the plot. Some earnestly serious issues are touched upon, such as suicide, abuse, homophobia, bullying, and the aforementioned mental health problems. But it is all just thrown together to produce an angsty stew of – perhaps slightly above averagely – damaged teens and their shenanigans.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is set in the '90s, and this is established very nicely with the correct technology, attire and especially musical references, including whole scenes dedicated to the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Now, Rocky Horror was a bit before my time (thankfully?), but I'm glad to know it was already a somewhat nerdy thing to like back in the early '90s.In the end, walking out of the cinema, all I was left with were lingering feelings of melancholy and confusion. Melancholy, as I was thinking about the main characters' damaged pasts; and confusion about why this rather bland story was ever made into a movie in the first place.All reviews are inherently subjective, but given the widely varying reviews of this movie, I suspect you probably have to see for yourself whether this is a movie you'll enjoy. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful film about growing and loving while struggling to be a teenager,"Charlie is an introvert teen trying to manoeuvre his way through his freshman year of high school. But it's difficult when you have no friends, you're dealing with recent tragedy in your life, and you've withdrawn into yourself. He's a prime target for bullying.But then he meets Patrick and Sam, two quirky older teens who are inseparable. And full of life. Oh so full of life. They take Charlie under their wing and show him what it means to be accepted, to be understood, to be loved. ""Welcome to the island of misfit toys,"" Sam whispers to Charlie. For the first time in a long time, Charlie feels like he belongs and that he is surrounded by people who understand. And he starts to blossom and emerge from his cocoon.But Charlie is still dealing with his own demons and recurring bouts of mental illness. His friends are the only things keeping him together. And when an incident temporarily tears them apart, he finds himself falling back into his emotional abyss.But Charlie isn't the only one who has pain. Both Patrick and Sam have experienced their own troubles and each deals with them in a different way. Sam is thoughtful and tender but her low self-esteem leads her to accept less than she deserves from her suitors. Patrick sheaths his own internal turmoil with showy bravado in the form of an extrovert.This was the most beautiful teen movie I've ever watched and tears emerged several times while watching it. I could feel the pain of the characters as I learned each of their secrets and realized that they were all just trying to make it through those torturous teen years without going crazy. The level of depth of each of these characters has hardly been matched in any other film I've seen.I fell in love with Charlie, Sam and Patrick and was truly heartbroken to say goodbye to them as the credits began to roll. But I knew they had each other and that they had formed a lifelong bond that would see them through what would undoubtedly be more tough times ahead.The three main actors in the movie are mind-blowingly good. Emma Watson does a great job breaking out of the Hermoine Granger pigeon hole as Sam. Logan Lerman is wonderful as Charlie: awkward, shy, uncertain, and sensitive. He wants to fit in but he doesn't quite know how. He needs to find friends that fit him. But Ezra Miller! Wow! This is the second ground-breaking performance I've seen him in. Following up a positively mesmerizing performance in ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"", Miller oozes flamboyance, charm and wit as Patrick. Others who round out an outstanding supporting cast include Paul Rudd, Joan Cusack and Dylan McDermott.I rate this movie 9/10. It's a beautiful and touching glimpse into the lives of three incredible teenagers. I will hold fond memories of them all for a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The perks of watching this movie,"Right from the first time that I heard about the movie I knew it was going to be good, because it was going to be directed by the own writer of the book. ' They changed some aspects that I find important and relevant to the story but aside from that, I consider this one of the best adaptations from book to movie. The film is perfectly directed and has amazing performances by the main actors, especially from Ezra Miller who brought such personality to a character who could be so easily ruined by some other actor.It shows a group of friends and their adventures without being totally predictable, lame or cliché which nowadays it something really rare. I've watched the movie a hundred times and I never get tired because the movie is different, not like another teenage movie that shows teens with problems with their parents because they can't go to a party or problems with their girlfriend/boyfriend because they cheated on them, and stuff like that. I also love how the characters are developed during the movie.

Smart and pleasing coming-of-age tale,"The high school genre has faced many ups and downs over the past few decades, with some films delivering an honest depictions of what its like to be a teenager in high school while some have come off as cheesy, uninspiring sex comedies that barred from reality. Rarely has Hollywood managed to generate a film so deeply honest in it's portrayal of the understandably complicated world of high school and adolescent angst. That is where this charming dramedy based on Stephen Chbosky's 1999 coming-of-age novel comes in. With author Chbosky pulling off an exceptionally feat of directing the film based on his own literary source material, Perks of Being a Wallflower comes almost nothing short of triumph in it's emotional journey through the eyes of a young high school adolescent. This film follows Charlie (played by Logan Lerman), a lonely young man entering his freshman year of high school, and is stuck in his own lonely world facing the dark memories of his late aunt who was killed in a car accident. When he meets seniors Sam (played by Emma Watson) and Patrick (played by Ezra Miller), they take him under their wing to where he learns the meanings friendship, love, and hope through a series of ventures through high school including prom, midnight showings of 'Rocky Horror Picture Show', and experimenting with relationships. Though the year in which the story takes place is not specified; the prominent soundtracks by David Bowie, and absence of the characters' cellphone usage and other advanced technology suggest the early 1990s.Stephen Chbosky proves himself as a mastermind behind establishing an authentic world of teenagers navigating through the tribulations and uncertainties of high school. In the process of translating his novel to the silver screen, Chbosky abandons his epistolary style incorporated in the novel in favor of traditional storytelling, and by many he knows how it make it work. The film dives into a deep character study of the lead character, and takes on us on an emotional journey of him struggling to find his place in the seemingly hopeless world of high school. Though teen-oriented films have prominent to following a basic storyline like this its almost a cliché, this one exercises it a beautifully constructed manner that feels more inspiring. From there on, we come to know a wide range of interesting characters who each have face a problem of their own that many teens around the world can easily relate to. One of which is Ezra Miller's character Patrick who struggles with his relentless need to hide his homosexual relationship with Johnny Simmons, which is interesting enough to provoke some important discussions. As the story proceeds, Chbosky grants us with a truly emotional ride as it navigates through Charlie and his mental trauma that threatens his tear apart his inner beings, and his friends who deal with common adolescent tribulations like dating abuse. But at the same time, he brings a certain charm to the story that results in a blissful experience without coming off emotionally contrived. Don't get me wrong, there are also some funny moments sprinkled throughout to let audiences breath from its primarily mature subject matter.The cast serves as not only one of the biggest driving mechanisms of the film, but also the emotional core of the film. Lead character Charlie is granted with a thoughtful performance by Logan Lerman hits the ball out of the park with his genuine emotional resonance and pure honesty. Emma Watson, fresh out of her role as Hermonie in the highly successful 'Harry Potter' franchise, provides a reasonable amount of substance and emotion in the role of Sam who comes a close friend of Charlie in the midst of his loneliness. Ezra Miller is quite absorbing in his role of Sam's stepbrother Patrick who must contend with his homosexuality, a performance more relaxed than his sinister portrayal as the psychologically disturbed child in 'We Need To Talk About Kevin'. Mae Whitman also treats us with a nifty little performance as Mary Elizabeth, a preppy girl who unexpectedly gets involved in a complicated relationship with Charlie. One of the biggest surprises that comes to the table however, is Paul Rudd who established a sense of ingenuity as Charlie's English teacher who becomes a faithful guiding hand for him.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a smart and pleasing coming-of-age dramedy that boasts an astonishingly realistic portrayal of high school adolescents as well as some incredible performances by a team of inspiring young actors. This film is certainly not like many other teen-target flicks, its one that is brutally honest and profoundly easy for many teenagers to relate to.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very realistic,"This movie is one of the best in the teen genre.The film exposes the feelings of a teenager who does not fit in and who has gone through emotional situations that affected his personality. It exposes it in a concrete and correct way, there is a good development of why the protagonist feels that way, the film has good photography, good performances and it turns out to be a portrait of the ball of feelings that a teenager begins to have and how it affects his life. The part that I did not like is the lack of development of a character, that although what he feels is exposed, there is no more development in his personality and ambitions.It is a true portrait of how it can feel not to fit in anywhere and how we all go through very strong emotional moments during our lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I am both happy and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be,"I first watched this movie when I was a bit young and, even though I enjoyed the experience, there were many things that I simply couldn't comprehend. Now, much older, but probably not old enough, this movie hits way harder.The situations covered include cliche teenage angst, which will obviously make many young people relate to it, if not to Charlie, to one of the supporting characters. But there's also mature and shocking themes that will surely grab the attention from the oldest audience as well.The film felt real in every single way. Every character, every friendship, every situation, good or bad, has depth. And this is why, differently from other teen movies, I actually liked and cared about every character. This supported by the amazing soundtrack and outstanding acting from Logan Lerman and everyone else makes the perks of being a wallflower a 10/10 to me.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dark stories that take you back to those painful teenage feelings and struggles.,"This film has an amazing cast and a great script...that is almost too smart for the ""kids"" who are depicted. It is a dark, dark story that has more than just the usual teenage difficulties and emotional acrobatics. This story involves some of the typical teen movie stuff...pranks, bullying, unrequited love, high school vs. College, etc. But it has some darker stories...suicide, death by tragic accident, child molestation, physical violence, drugs, alcohol, sex, closeted homosexuality and mental illness.Our main character is Charlie, a high school freshmen and aspiring writer who is not only an introverted outcast, but has some mental health issues. His first day of high school is a little rough but there is one teacher who notices him and goes on to encourage his reading and writing outside of school...and then there is ""Nothing"" (an unfortunate nickname given post a prank in shop class to a funny yet intellectual homosexual senior student named Patrick). Charlie appreciated Patrick's individuality and humor and joins Patrick in the stands at a football game in an effort to make a friend. Patrick who is easy going an accepting makes the introverted Charlie feel welcomed as does Patrick's step-sister Sam, who joins them in the stands. This begins Charlie's relationship with this crowd of misfits or as Sam calls them ""the island of misfit toys"".There are some interesting stories, some good people and some bad people...and teenagers just trying to fit in and survive their high school experiences.I love the idea brought by the English teacher when Charlie asks, ""that we accept the love that we feel like we deserve"" and how do you get someone to realize that they deserve more...you keep trying. That could have been a theme for this film.Great acting, great script and story....but really dark, sad and depressing. It really made me feel down...kind of like I did when I was going through my own teenage trials and tribulations. If you are prepared for those feelings I think this is a more than worthy film based on a book of the same title.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful.,"I just watched this movie for the first time. At first I thought it looked like some cliché high school movie. Of course, twenty and nearly-30-yr-olds play teens, which is rather unrealistic. (I'm still in high school and NO ONE has that nice of a complexion!) I continued to watch as Charlie, played by Logan Lerman, struggles to find friends. I also thought that was silly because this guy is very handsome and he definitely WOULD have friends, even if they'd only use him for his looks. So far, it seems like I hated it. Well, Emma Watson and some other dude befriend Charlie and from then on, the story bursts with passion, confusion, secrets, lust, and a wonderfully brilliant message about ""misfit"" teens. I cried at least 3 times throughout this-- granted, I was very exhausted today--but it contained honest humor and emotional connections. I would have given this a 10/10, but ""White Chicks"" takes first place. Either way, this movie is incredible and I recommend to everyone.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

In my opinion, he is one of the most underrated actors of our times. Also an honorable mention of all the other friends and Lerman's family (including Nina Dobrev of the Vampire Diaries fame as his sister) who make up a good supporting cast in a well-rounded film.Oh and also, Pittsburgh, PA continues to maintain the tradition of being associate with great movies.

Took me 8 years to finally get around to watching this movie,This movie came out when I was a freshman in high school though my high school experience was very different from Charlie's I still experienced a lot of the same emotions. Charlie is bullied in high school and I was not. Sure I caught a mean comment every once in a while but that was very seldom and far from bullying. My issue in high school was that I felt invisible. Like all of my friends had their own friends and that I just kind of floated between groups and no one ever really knew me. This movie made me remember all of those feelings.This is a heavy movie. It deals with some horrible themes that no one should ever have to go through. At times it made feel nostalgic other times it made me sad and at one point I was very angry after finding out what had happened to Charlie. All in all this movie is very emotional and one that will stick with me for quite some time.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Resonant,"It's all about the verisimilitude. Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of those rare movies where all aspects of the filmmaking fit perfectly into the overall direction of the movie with no element calling undue attention to itself. Bathed in a hazy glow, without any rapid-MTV style editing, the film feels like it was actually created in the '80s. The characters have their foibles while still remaining relatable- but more than that, they feel authentic. I didn't feel it was totally emblematic of my high school experience as others felt, but the themes and lessons of the film strongly resonate with that time in life.Ultimately, I found myself deeply invested in the characters not because of any of the standard screen writing tricks to build connection with the characters, but simply because I felt like I knew them like I know my friends.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Charlie is a very awkward and quiet guy. Sam and Patrick are the completely opposite. The underlining story and tone to this movie is surprisingly dark.

I saw this at the cinema straight after I re watched Percy Jackson & The Lightning Thief, and I don't think there's a role he can't pull off ie. Jack & Bobby when he was just a teenager, 3:10 to Yuma, and he was also very believable in Riding in Cars with Boys. Ezra Miller was also wonderful, he made you laugh, and he made you cry, and his character was so beautiful written.

Teens interpreting every experience as a deep meaningful lesson,"I thought this movie was just okay, great songs and beautiful shots captured on film. I never would have watched it but a friend recommended it to me. I decided to read the book first and watch the movie after, nothing really stood out except for the message about living.It's short and interesting enough to sit through, I loved that they decided to use grainy film where combined with the soft yellow lights added a dreamy warm feel to the movie. However the story and pacing as a whole is unengaging enough that I missed the big reveal at the end even after watching and reading the book. Important dramatic scenes are kind of rushed and we move on to other subplots, while less interesting scenes get more screen time. Which also happens in the book in a way.The cast is great but to me Ezra Miller seemed to carry the movie and it doesn't make sense for Emma Watson's character to have an English accent, but I get it, they needed a big star to sell tickets, and she was fresh off the success of last few Harry Potter movies. For Charlie, I found it difficult to really care for what he was going through, while the audience is supposed to sympathize with him, is quite bland. As an introvert, I could relate to him being a wallflower, I just couldn't connect to the character. Which is much more challenging in the book where it's told through Charlie's letters to an anonymous friend. Some parts seem to try too hard to come across as deep and profound, maybe to a teen or young adult it would sound deep, but to me it sounded like teens who need to chill out and stop overthinking every experience. Oh, and really? A skinny kid like Charlie can take on a football team if he blacks out?🙄I understand the praise and hype that the movie gets, but it's just not for me and I've watched it multiple times to try and see what other people love about the movie and book. Maybe I'm not wallflowery enough to enjoy it or the actor portraying Charlie being a wallflower felt unauthentic.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Timeless,"While The Perks of Being a Wallflower gives us a retrospective look at 90s high school, there is an ineffable timelessness of the ups and downs, the joy and the strife that Logan Lerman experiences. Each high schooler can relate to the turbulence of Lerman's life, spending one day eating lunch alone and the next partying away the night with friends. His awkward but genuine, vulnerable personality makes him a relatable character for all teenagers. I was grinning from ear to ear during the intimate moments between Lerman and Watson, and I was kicking myself during the awkward ones, which is exactly how the film is supposed to feel.
Though the plot is arguably cliché and unexceptional, the movie feels incredibly authentic in its storytelling. Yes, to the film pundit, there are plot holes and cheesy, unrealistic moments, but to hopeless romantics, younger spirits, and more typical consumers like me, the film really strikes a chord.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
school can be an unpleasant time,"I didn't know anything about ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"" when I started watching it, which made it even more of a treat. This story of a high school freshman befriended by some seniors is perfectly upfront about school. I could relate to a lot of it, in fact.While Logan Lerman plays the lead role, I think that the majority of the praise should go to Emma Watson. Like her most famous role, Watson's character is a strong-willed individual, but obviously it's a serious character here (and she does manage a US accent effectively).Basically, this movie works as a fine counterbalance to the high school movies that emphasize popular dudes, queen bees, etc. It's a no-nonsense focus on those unpleasant years.

The cinematography, the soundtrack and the acting where simply magnificent.

Facing the demos of shyness, awareness, fear and repressed memories the main character begins the journey of his life.If you have ever felt alone, different or on the fringe then this story will bring you home, make you face some old wounds and heal.Pure depth and pure brilliance.This is a movie not to be missed!!!

This was just such a feel good movie but at the same time, being very serious, easy to relate to. The directing was also great.The reason I liked this film so much is that you almost forget your watching a film. The characters are just so believable and acted well that you forget your watching a movie. And when a film does that, you know it was a great movie.So my final rating is. 5/5 Stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Movie,"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of my all time favorite movies. I read the book before I watched the movie and absolutely loved it. When I read the book I felt a connection with Charlie, the main character. But the first time I watched the movie it was like meeting an old friend. Much of the characters personalities were the same which helped me feel more connected. I love the way this film was shot and the way the book was written, using letters to an anonymous person. I have heard many people say that this movie deals with serious topics in an insensitive way. I do not think that is the case. I see Charlie and other characters react to situations the same way I think I would. With that said, I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This Movie is Great,My only major issue is that some how they've never heard heroes by David Bowie. Like they're all really deep into music and shi-t but they don't know David Bowie's most famous song. DUMB WACK. But otherwise this movie's really good,9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good despite The Smiths,"Jess's choice for family film night and it was an evocative and effecting films that belies the poster. I was genuinely surprised by how much I enjoyed it despite The Smiths on the soundtrack. Family score of ****.Once on a yellow piece of paper with green lines
he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Chops""
because that was the name of his dogAnd that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
and a gold star
And his mother hung it on the kitchen door
and read it to his aunts
That was the year Father Tracy
took all the kids to the zooAnd he let them sing on the bus
And his little sister was born
with tiny toenails and no hair
And his mother and father kissed a lot
And the girl around the corner sent him a
Valentine signed with a row of X'sand he had to ask his father what the X's meant
And his father always tucked him in bed at night
And was always there to do itOnce on a piece of white paper with blue lines
he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Autumn""because that was the name of the season
And that's what it was all about
And his teacher gave him an A
and asked him to write more clearly
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because of its new paintAnd the kids told him
that Father Tracy smoked cigars
And left butts on the pews
And sometimes they would burn holes
That was the year his sister got glasses
with thick lenses and black frames
And the girl around the corner laughedwhen he asked her to go see Santa Claus
And the kids told him why
his mother and father kissed a lot
And his father never tucked him in bed at night
And his father got mad
when he cried for him to do it.Once on a paper torn from his notebook
he wrote a poem
And he called it ""Innocence: A Question""
because that was the question about his girl
And that's what it was all about
And his professor gave him an Aand a strange steady look
And his mother never hung it on the kitchen door
because he never showed her
That was the year that Father Tracy died
And he forgot how the end
of the Apostle's Creed wentAnd he caught his sister
making out on the back porch
And his mother and father never kissed
or even talked
And the girl around the corner
wore too much makeup
That made him cough when he kissed herbut he kissed her anyway
because that was the thing to do
And at three a.m. He tucked himself into bed
his father snoring soundlyThat's why on the back of a brown paper bag
he tried another poemAnd he called it ""Absolutely Nothing""
Because that's what it was really all about
And he gave himself an A
and a slash on each damned wrist
And he hung it on the bathroom door

This Wallflower is a Wallflower,"I'd heard this film referenced quite a few times over the years since it was originally released and decided to finally check it out. It's fine. For the most part all of the performances are solid and deliver. Unfortunately, what doesn't fully deliver is the story. It's a solid premise and I went into it hoping to relate and experience something new in this story that has been covered in countless films before. I did see some things that I could relate to but it was the same things I've seen done before in other films and often time more effectively. This is a well worn story line of this high school kid not fitting in and one day is befriended by someone cooler and everything starts to look up. Sure there is a little more to it that that but not enough to make The Perks of Being a Wallflower memorable.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best teenage drama films in recent times,"Even if you may not know most of the cast before sitting down to watch this film, all of them will stay with you long after the credits roll. Any movie which makes you think after-wards about it is a movie worth watching, and this one will not just make you think but also make you feel. The acting is superb, especially of the three lead actors.Logan Lerman of the Three Musketeers is incredible as the quiet shy and troubled teen. He shows his anxiety and nervousness with ease. Ezra Miller is one of the stars. His role as Patrick is one of the most memorable ones. Emma Watson, in her first major role post harry potter acts so convincingly that she manages to make everyone forget that she used to play a harry potter character...something which Daniel Radcliffe has not been able to successfully pull off yet.Maybe this film shows what can happen if the author of the book which inspired it is also the director. Stephen Chbosky's semi autobiographical book of the same name is lovingly adapted in this film and in some places it feels as if you are reading a good book. The story is really touching and for many high-schoolers and college students they will relate to it. The music runs smoothly with the film and elevates or depresses the mood very effectively when required.The rest of the cast gives a good performance and despite this being a high school movie, it does not succumb to clichés. The Perks Of Being A Wallflower is a refreshing and heart touching film about love, loss and feeling infinite. See it if you want to see a drama which works on many levels.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Beautiful Adaptation,"Having read the novel 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky and loved every sentence, I was quite sceptical about watching the film. I worried it would not live up to my expectations after the novel but I am glad to say I was pleasantly surprised. The film succeeded to not only meet but exceed my expectations. First of all, the soundtrack was perfectly selected. It displayed Charlie's confused emotions throughout. Being a music student (and aiming to be a music soundtrack supervisor or work in the film music industry) I admired the choice of songs and felt it truly reflected Charlie's character. Secondly, I enjoyed how well the script was acted by all of the actors. They portrayed an honest awkwardness as young adults often have and yet their relationships and friendships were relatable and realistic. Thirdly, I feel obligated to mention my respect for Logan Lerman as an actor and must mention how greatly he played Charlie. His characterization of such a troubled teenager was spot on and he deserves great praise for portraying Charlie fantastically.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rollercoaster of Emotions,"This movie perfectly encapsulates the highs of lows of a quiet kid's high school experience. It touches on many different serious topics in a respectful and captivating way. Although many people cannot personally relate to all of these challenges, it provides a gripping first-person account of what it must feel like to live through them. There are many other high school films that attempt the same, but many fall into overused tropes or lack sufficient character development to convey genuine emotion to the viewer. I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking to relive their high school experience through an honest but hopeful lens of nostalgia.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

It is transcendent and sincere and of special interest to those of us (especially the introspective and isolated among us) who remember moving forward from junior high to the new and strange place called high school. The story deals straightforwardly and honestly with the many personal issues we all experienced as children during those times, awkwardly developing into teenagers and adults. The pains and wonders of the process are extraordinarily examined in this wonderfully crafted film. The script is literate, the ensemble cast is excellent and the mood thoughtful and ultimately uplifting. It is one of the best of its genre and enthusiastically recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Perks of Watching This Film,"For a film I knew nothing about I went into this thinking it would be nothing special, but wow was I mistaken. Carried by a great performance of the cast and so many powerful themes such as trauma, mental health, friendship, and self identity I can see many people in their own ways finding someway to connect to this story, especially in such a crucial time in peoples lives (High School). Growing up, high school is where most people begin to branch out and become who they want to be. Find that something that makes you happy and pursue it and to not be afraid. This film helps to express the purpose of having a friend group where you feel comfortable and can be true to yourself. As well as no matter what someone may be going through you can and should have someone to talk to and to not bottle things away. As it is always nice to make sure others are happy, you always come first and need to make sure you are happy and in good health. Overall this film brought me through every emotion and left me overall satisfied at the end and can say I would easily comeback to this film down the road.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Real talk,"Seriously
High school films devoid of archetypes are few and far between, and the same goes for high school films that don't adopt a goofy approach. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an exception in both categories, and still it is every bit as enjoyable as the most audience-friendly films in this subgenre. They key, I suspect, is that the director is also the screenwriter and the novelist behind the book upon which the film is based. His name is Stephen Chbosky, and he takes the problems of youth every bit as seriously as John Hughes did in The Breakfast Club in the 1980s. Based on his 1999 novel of the same name, his script is full of care for and understanding of these kids, and he's able to transfer the literary quality to the screen without making it feel contrived. He also seems to be a real actors' director, giving his wonderful cast time to blossom and develop together. There's an undeniable bond and unity between particularly the trio Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller, and rarely have teenagers come across as more human and real than they do here. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a homage to youth, and a.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"It stays with you, and it is devastatingly beautiful.","No other movie has stuck and followed me years after I've watched it.Not only does it contain music that will haunt you, but if you've experienced being alone, or sat alone at lunch in highschool, this movie will stick with you. It's a relatable movie, and that allows for it to be rewatched whenever you need to feel a little less alone. It tackles tons of subjects about being a teenager, and struggling through everything. The way the story all comes together at the end, its beautiful.The cinemetography deserves a mention as well because it adds so much to the scenes, the composition of every shot and scene is so well thought out. The acting pulls you in, and you sympathize with the characters, you feel embrassed for them. At the end you have to remind yourself that those were not teens, they were actors. But the way every emotion is portrayed will stay with you .because it is so realistic to what many have gone through.This movie is a horror without without anything scary, it is just devastingly beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
We are infinite,"Greetings again from the darkness. Brace for gushing. Last evening I attended a screening that included a fascinating Q&A with writer/director Stephen Chbosky. It reminded me of how personal and intimate and observant and incisive a well-made film can be. A well written script is so refreshing, and an exceptional script can be truly breath-taking. Mr. Chbosky takes the unusual step of directing his own screenplay based on his own novel (a 1999 bestseller), and he left me stunned and enthralled.The popularity of the novel would typically make the film version a disappointment for its fans. Not so this time. Mr. Chbosky remains true to the spirit despite the need to edit for the sake of continuity and brevity. The key characters spring to life thanks to the efforts of four strong performances from young actors: Logan Lerman (Percy Jackson, The Three Muskateers) plays Charlie, Emma Watson (Harry Potter films) is Sam, Ezra Miller (We Need to Talk About Kevin, City Island) is Patrick, and Mae Whitman (Arrested Development) is Mary Elizabeth.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Book Review For The Perks Of Being A Wallflower,"What was the movie about? The movie was about the boy named Charlie. The movie was about his life. It was about Charlie's family members and his friends Sam and Patrick. This movie also talked about another person who is Charlie's, Aunt Helen.Who were the main characters/ How did you like the actors? Logan Lerman- (Charlie), Emma Watson- (Sam), Johnny Simmons- (Brad), Paul Rudd- (Mr. Anderson), Ezra Miller- (Patrick). I like the actors by their activeness, responsibilities. Also their trustworthy, helpful, caring, confident, and also hopeful.What was your favorite part of the film? My favorite part of the film was when the teacher Mr. Anderson said, ""We accept the love that we deserve"" to Charlie. Also when Charlie and Sam became a really good friend. Also when Sam passed the SAT test!Compare it to the book. Did you like the film or the book more/ Explain. I think I would like the book because it mostly talked about the real things about all characters in the book. But in the film, some of the things are just faked up. They are just made that up.On a scale of 1-5 stars, what rating would you give the movie? Why? I would rate this movie 3 because some of the things about in this movie are really match with the book. But some of them are not. For example, in this movie, it doesn't really talk about Mr. Bill.Finally, I can say that this movie is good but less than the real book The Perks of being a Wallflower. The characters names are still same, nothing changed! The book and this movie actually talked about the character's actions or their works. They both actually shows us the all character's characteristics traits.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
