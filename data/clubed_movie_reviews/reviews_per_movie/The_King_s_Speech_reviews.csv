The King says a mouthful,"There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless.The King's Speech boasts an exceptional cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
King Colin,"After seeing ""Apartment Zero"" and being bowled over again by his amazing performance as the Argentinean pretending to be British, I felt the urge to see ""The King's Speech"" again - So glad I did. It was very moving to see Adrian Leduc being George VI. What an astonishing actor. In Apartment Zero he creates a character without a personality. A repressed, innocent that comes out as a total weirdo but we know better. His undeclared needs reflected in Colin Firth's eyes are a prodigious acting feast. In The King's Speech, his George VI suffers from a different fear but it's also pungently clear in the actor's eyes. I think what they both share is a desperate wish to be invisible. For King George that's an impossibility so, his struggle to move forward, learning to be the man everyone expects him to be is enormously moving. As you may have guessed, Colin Firth has become one of my favorite actors of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Colin Speaks,"What a wonderful performance! Compassion and clarity of vision, side by side. Colin Firth has been a favourite of mine since the extraordinary ""Apartment Zero' (1989) His maturity as an actor reflects his maturity as a person and how many times are we able to say that? Very few I'm afraid. What I thought I saw in him as an actor playing the zero of the title in ""Apartment Zero"" is here in spades. Wow! How rewarding! Here he's not alone. Goeffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter and Guy Pearce are all standouts and the stutter is just a device to show a whole picture. How strange we knew so little about this man. I guess Hitler got all the headlines. So from a historical perspective is also a feast of sorts. Bravo indeed!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Royal Treat,"You heard it from me: Not even James Franco with his boffo performance in 127 Hours can beat Colin Firth for the Oscar in King's Speech, a docudrama about the Duke of York (Firth) becoming King George VI while overcoming a crushing stutter. Not only does the actor get pitch perfect the stutter, but he also invests a kindness, courage, and vulnerability in the character that work in harmony to create an unforgettable George in an exquisite period peace.Not to forget how generously Geoffrey Rush underplays Lionel, the speech therapist who is instrumental in making the king a speaker and a friend. That low-key acting allows Firth the room to expand his king's personality without interference from an Oscar-winning co-star. This is history as I like to learn it—honest and engaging with palaces and minor characters well-appointed and underplayed themselves as part of a mosaic of challenges facing a handicapped king and a nation on the brink of WWII. The pace is close to languid, better to allow us to settle in for the painful transformation of a man unused to public speaking but used to family mocking his disability.George's bravery is the film's heartbeat, not flamboyant courage, mind you, but rather the kind that wakes us up to the character as complex and lovable. But valor is not his exclusively, Guy Pearce's Edward, who abdicates for his love, Wallace Simpson, can be seen as a courageous man giving up a crown for love or a fool falling for a twice-divorced socialite.Such an ambivalence is fitting for a film that gently introduces you to a period in British history when alliances are not clear and allegiances dangerous. One thing is patently clear, however—this is going to be on most critics' best film of the year list with a sure Oscar winner for its star. If Firth missed the brass ring last year in A Single Man, he'll grab it this year in King's Speech.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Brilliant movie!,"This is a biopic about how King George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth II, overcame his stuttering problem. Widely considered by all but his father unfit to be king, George is reluctantly thrust unto the throne and into the spotlight after his brother is forced to abdicate. Overshadowed on the global stage by powerful orators like Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the King relies on the help of a little-known Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue to find his voice and courageously lead his people into the most devastating war humanity has ever faced.This is a powerful, hilarious and deeply moving story, told against the backdrop of a critical juncture in modern history, of the emergence of a deep friendship out of a professional relationship between two men who would otherwise never have socially interacted. The screenplay, written by David Seidler (who also wrote Tucker: The Man and his Dream), is excellent. The dry British wit is hilarious. I was literally slapping my knee during some of the scenes. Tom Hooper (Elizabeth I) does a superb job directing this movie. The buildup to the climactic finale is skillfully executed and prompted the audience to erupt into spontaneous applause. (Apparently, this also happened at the Roy Thomson Hall premiere.) Geoffrey Rush (Elizabeth: The Golden Age) does a fantastic job as Lionel Logue and Colin Firth (A Single Man) is excellent as King George VI.I saw the second public screening of this movie at the Ryerson Theater during the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF). Tom Hooper was present to introduce the movie. He was joined by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush after the movie ended for a brief Q&A.It turns out that David Seidler also had a stuttering problem as a child and drew inspiration from the king's struggle. Early in his career he wanted to write a screenplay about it. He dutifully asked the Queen Mother for permission. She agreed but told him ""not in my lifetime"". Little did he know she would live to be 101 and he would have to wait another 30 years.Another interesting tidbit we learned was that near the end of the shoot, the crew finally located one of Lionel Logue's grandsons, who just so happened to live about 10 minutes away from the director. They got access to Lionel's diaries and correspondence and managed to incorporate some of it into the script.This movie is an unqualified must see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"A touching, historical masterpiece","I rarely rate a movie a ""10"" but in this case, it is well deserved. Truly, there is no way to improve upon the achievement that this film represents, whether in casting, direction, writing, artistic value, you name it.The story gives us a fascinating look into the struggles faced by George VI on his way to becoming king of England. The story line is all about his stuttering, but underneath all that are suppressed memories from childhood, growing up in the shadow of an elder brother, perpetual negative reinforcement from a domineering father, etc. It's a psychoanalytical look at a well-known royal family, and while I can't vouch for its absolute veracity, it gives a rare glimpse into the lives of people we wouldn't otherwise observe at this level of intimacy (much like ""Queen"" did a few years ago).The contrast between George and Edward VIII is most fruitful. It's the clash between duty and hedonism, fulfilling one's personal quest for happiness vs. overcoming one's worst fears on behalf of your people and country. Edward is typically romanticized and lionized, but here we see him as more of a spoiled, selfish lout.But the heart of the movie is the relationship between George and Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who is helping him overcome his speech problems. Both actors are at the absolute top of their form. Firth is brilliant as the aloof, initially reluctant and distrustful monarch, while Rush shows the same wink-of-the-eye humor and irony that he did as Barbossa, relishing the sheer inequality of their positions yet knowing the extent to which George is dependent on him. Ultimately a true friendship develops between the men, and since they are both such endearing characters, it's a joy to watch.I should add that Helena Bonham-Carter is also spot-on as the haughty yet practical queen consort. Other more minor roles are effectively played (e.g., Winston Churchill, George V). The entire movie is a perfect blend of history, personal and familial drama, with broader themes of perseverance and overcoming adversity which give it a timeless application.Lastly, in this movie's case, the ""R"" rating is for ""Ridiculous."" The only potentially offensive material is some over-the-top language (including the F-word) which plays a part in one scene, and is clearly used for comic purpose and with great effect. I unhesitatingly took my 13 year old daughter and (depending on the child) might be okay for even younger ones. Don't let that stop you from seeing this gem.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Superb drama of courage and humanity,"I think I must have seen a different film from the previous two reviewers at Leeds on Friday. It is now two days ago and I am still feeling overwhelmed by what I saw. It is a very touching, and quite inspiring story about a man, psychologically scarred, and trapped in a situation from which he could have no escape and facing it with immense courage. It so happens that he was royal, and that was a large part of his problem- but the film isn't so much about royalty as a human story. The film conveyed very powerfully in the opening scene, the enormity of what was required of him. As the film develops, the complexities of the character are revealed. The acting is superb, especially from the three principals, and the development of the troubled and sparky relationship at the heart of the film is a joy to watch. The film is very funny and the characters have warmth and humanity. The film is well paced, and carries you along to the emotional climax, so that, even though I knew the story, it had me holding my breath. If you don't need lots of action or special effects in your film, and enjoy seeing top-notch actors at the very peak of their craft, this will be for you. You might also, as I did, gain a bit more insight into the human drama behind a significant, but relatively unexplored period of British history.If CF and GR both win Oscars they will be more than worthy winners and if they don't then ""best"" has no meaning.One further thought- anyone who thinks that this film is unsuitable for teenage viewers needs to have a long hard look at their priorities. It could prove inspirational to anyone with communication difficulties.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A wonderful movie!,"No spoilers here. I would like to let everyone know that this is an excellent film. I enjoyed it this week at the Mill Valley Film Festival in Marin County, CA. Given the outstanding cast and director, and my fascination with historical figures, I had high hopes for this film, though mixed with a certain resignation that I might be disappointed. There was no way I could have imagined how wonderful ""The King's Speech"" would be. There was abundant humor without the film ever becoming a comedy, drama without dreariness, and many deeply moving moments. I can't praise this film enough. It boosted my appreciation of the human capacity to become our best selves, and rise to meet even the most daunting challenges.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush Are a Pleasure to Watch,"While the very idea of a stammering king is inherently interesting, as is the historical context of a gathering world war, the real substance of this movie is the interplay between two fine actors, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. Firth gives a particularly rich performance, bringing his character to life with depth and subtlety.As an American, I find the notion of monarchy in the Twenty-First Century to be at best puzzling. But the movie helps us understand the importance of the king as a unifying symbol of Britain during a time when the very existence of Britain was under threat. So even we Yanks can see how crucial it is that the king be able to address the people with reasonable fluency.A very enjoyable film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Well, now we know where all the Oscars are going. Or should...","I could write for hours about this film. I only just heard about it last night at a New Year's Eve party. Saw it today. To use the vernacular, OMG. Director Tom Hooper has a masterpiece on his hands. Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Derek Jacobi, and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill, all turn in excellent performances. Not to forget Guy Pearce as King Edward who abdicated his throne for an American divorcée. David Seidler's script is brilliant. The story is laid out cleverly. The pace and rhythm are PERFECT.I think this is one of the best films ever made. It will tear at your guts. And that is where Collin Firth comes in. Mr. Firth gives one of the most poignant and affective performances ever by a male movie star. Where, inside himself, an actor goes for a performance like this, is beyond my comprehension.In the movie, ""A Single Man"", Colin Firth served notice that he was an actor of depth and subtlety, the surface of which he had only just begun to scratch. Now, he's more than scratched that surface. He's gouged a chasm through it. He plays the tormented, soon to be King of England, George VI, and does so in a way that very early in the movie buries his hooks in you and doesn't let go. I can not ever recall, while watching a film, having to choke back tears for over an hour and a half. The suffering portrayed by Firth as George VI is subtle at times. In your face at others. But painfully present always. When Firth bellows, ""I am a King"" I nearly lost it in a very quiet, and stunned, theater. If you've already seen this film you know what this refers to.As an American I find the concept of a monarchy bewildering. Why is one person more privileged than another just because of the womb he or she sprang from? That being said, I do find the stories of those trapped in this anachronistic time warp fascinating at times. This would be one of those times. This film is the intersection of great personal pain, international upheaval, and a family that is ceremoniously dysfunctional to it's core.Above this chaos, confusion, and unrest, rises a weak shell of a man to greatness. Colin Firth is the vessel for that transformation and if he doesn't win an Oscar for this performance it will tarnish the Academy forever in my humble opinion. This is the kind of performance, and film overall, that you leave thinking to yourself that you've just seen the greatest movie ever. Maybe later you'll see another brilliant film and think that ""this one"" is the best ever, but for now ""The King's Speech"" has no equal.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Good movie, with a great cast","This is a beautiful and well made movie. The director has made the story of King George VI into something more interesting than just ""the story"". The movie starts with George as the duke of York, and follows his way to become king, and his difficulties with the stammering. George finds a therapist, Lionel Logue, who will become more than just a therapist. A true friend.The movie is really well made. The music, the cinematography, the cast, the script etc. is good, and as it should be.Colin Firth in the role as King George VI is really good, and he is completely convincing as a man who struggles with different things, such as his temperament, memories from his childhood and of course: his stammering. The story of King George, and how he defeats this problem with stammering is a touching story to follow. Overall, a good movie, but not the best. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

One word; Brilliant,"The title of the film wouldn't necessarily have caught my eye, but am I glad I went to see this film, courtesy of an advance screening. It was bound to be good with Colin Firth playing the Duke of York who went on to become George VI, and he didn't let the audience down. Let's not forget also the other main characters, Lionel Logue played by Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter as the Duchess of York, Michael Gambon as George V and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill - all absolutely perfect for their respective roles. Whilst the dates in the film might not have been completely accurate, the film tells the story perfectly, sometimes humorously and and certainly sensitively, and I would like to think in such a way that doesn't cause any embarrassment to any surviving members of our Royal Family or indeed people who suffer from what must be a very difficult condition to live with. Certainly a film I would recommend to my friends.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Not entirely speechless,"While his ascension to the throne of England seems imminent, future King George VI struggles with a speech impediment that won't allow him to speak in public without a fair amount of embarrassment to himself and his audience. He seeks and finds help by approaching speech therapist Lionel Logue who offers him his services. This Oscar nominee showcases some very entertaining and witty writing accompanied by excellent cinematography and acting. I don't however think the film is all that it is made out to be with the exceptionally high score it currently presents itself with on this website and roaring Oscar buzz. The story itself is quite thin and there aren't many memorable scenes that warrant a second viewing any time soon.74/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Solid But Unspectacular,"In opening, I must say that everyone involved with this production did a solid job. They all did their duty. In that sense, the movie resembles the British royal family as a whole - they're not especially important really, but they perform a useful function that fate has assigned them to. The trappings of monarchy aside, I suspect that their lives are probably rather dull and largely scripted. That brief description of royal life and duty sums this movie up perfectly.There's really nothing wrong with it. Colin Firth was believable as King George VI, Helena Bonham Carter good (if, I thought, a little too irreverent in places) as his wife Elizabeth. George was the second son of King George V. As such, he was never supposed to be King, never trained to be King and afflicted with a terrible speech impediment that probably made him relieved to know that he would never be King, with all the public duties entailed with the office. Then - the abdication crisis, as his brother King Edward VIII gives up the throne for the woman he loves (the American divorcée Wallis Simpson) leaving poor Bertie (as George was known) to take up the reins and the responsibility of rallying the nation as Britain and its Empire slide toward inevitable war with Nazi Germany.The movie begins with Bertie's disastrous and almost incoherent 1925 speech at Wembley and ends with a still hesitant but nevertheless eloquent speech declaring war on Germany in 1939. In between, the movie essentially deals with the speech therapy that Bertie received from the Australian Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush.) It isn't really all that interesting to witness almost two hours of speech therapy, but one has to feel a certain sympathy for Bertie as he faces this situation that to him must have been terrifying as well as a certain admiration for him - unlike his brother, he sucked it up and overcame his weaknesses and limitations and did his duty. Firth did an admirable job of drawing us into the King's emotional torment as he takes on this role he never wanted. So, while the movie as a whole isn't exciting or - at times at least - even particularly interesting, it's solid. I personally don't think it rises beyond that, and I think it's somewhat over-rated. But it's solid. Just like the royals themselves, it does its duty, even if it does so unspectacularly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Charming Film,"By a strange irony the film I'd watched at the cinema the previous night was 127 HOURS by Britain's most innovative director Danny Boyle whilst this evening's offering was THE KING'S SPEECH which had made in Britain plastered all over it . Boyle's film fails to a large extent because it's rather anti-cinematic where as Tom Hooper's film should fail down to the rather passé seen it all before feel that tries a little too hard tro appeal to prize ceremonies . If I was disappointed by Boyle's latest offering I was pleasantly surprised by THE KINGS SPEECHThe movie suffer somewhat from the hype surrounding it but that's not to take away from the fact that it's one of the most charming films I've seen in a long time . Watching a movie at a cinema has both pros and cons . It's an expensive night out and there's the danger of being surrounded by philistines and peasants of the most bourgeoisie kind but one good thing is to guage public opinion as to the merits of a movie and listening to the crowd react to the pithy dialogue with delayed laughter reminded me how an audience reacts to the best works of Wood Allen or Mike Leigh . This is very much comedy of manners developed to its best potentialColin Firth is an actor I first took notice of in TUMBLEDOWN . He's best at playing manly roles but until now he's been best known for playing Mr Darcy in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE but is never less than superb as Prince Albert/King George and this is a career defining performance which will almost certainly earn him an Oscar .. Geoffry Rush as Lionel Logue as a maverick speech therapist who has a slightly dark secret is equally superb and will earn an Oscar nod at least . With this type of movie a film largely succeeds or fails due to the supporting cast since the two are in danger of dominating the film to the detriment of everyone else but Bonham Carter , Jacobi , Pearce and Gambon make an impact with their small roles as does as unrecognisable Anthony AndrewsRealising that the main story of the Prince's stammer isn't enough to carry a 2 hour film the screenplay by David Seidler has a couple of subplots involving King Edward's abdication and the ascent of Hitler in Germany and director Hooper develops the subplots very well . If there's a problem with the film it does have "" Award winning movie "" written all over it but as I said it's so charming you quickly forget that . If it sweeps the award ceremonies it'll probably be down to the merit and even this republican film goer was swept up in the story .

Mission accomplished: maximum number of Oscar acquired,"Two years after the decent but unremarkable ""Slumdog Millionaire"" got an Oscar, and a year after the even more unremarkable ""The Hurt Locker"" also undeservedly received the coveted statue, the Academy performs an even worse atrocity by denying The Social Network and Black Swan (among others) the best picture award, instead opting for ""The King's Speech"", a movie so obviously engineered to win a lot of Oscars that it hurts.Of course, this is not a BAD movie. It is just that every aspect of it is directed at raking in as much Oscars as possible: an ""inspiring"" story, based on ""a true story"", about an underdog who overcomes his difficulties and comes out triumphantly, all set to appropriate and beautiful classical music.Granted, it's an expertly made movie. The acting by Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter is first-class and the cinematography is beautiful.Unfortunately, a story about a man overcoming his stuttering is about as boring as it sounds, and the totally risk-less direction doesn't help things either. Historical accuracy is thrown out of the window in favor of creating sympathy and the result is a movie that lacks any kind of real drama or conflict. Instead it just moves along a predictable course in which the ""protagonist"" overcomes predicable problems (childhood trauma, anyone) and achieves a predictable triumph.Along the way, it IS good for an occasional smile, a cozy warm feeling, and a little bit of historical insight. But inspiring cinema, this is not. Rather, it's an over-engineered piece aimed at pleasing the crowd in general and the academy in particular. It's not surprising it works, but it doesn't make the movie by itself any good",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
not worth the praise,"I really do not get the Hollywood's weakness for everything royal and British. It is enough for a British actor to play an English queen or king to get nominated, it seems. For example Helena Bonham getting nominated here is just ridiculous, she is good of course but nothing deserving an Oscar nomination. The film is well made and acted, but is basically a lie, sentimental and simplistic one at that. King Edward VIII, the older brother here, was a known supporter of Hitler but the film does not mention it here. King George's speech impediment was not really so important, because the king's role was pretty limited at the time and his importance was little compared to prime minister's Churchill in preparing the country for war. Big deal that he was stuttering, he could have been mute and it still would not have changed much! The film also conveniently ignores that king George was NOT Churchill's supporter and thought his politics of clearly opposing Hitler was incorrect, instead he showed strong support for Neville Chamberlain's politics of appeasement, even after Chamberlain had cynically approved in Munich Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia! If it were up to king George, Churchill would not have been appointed PM, Halifax would have. And Halifax was just another Chamberlain. So the film is a sentimental lie for naive, sentimental public.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Five Reasons to see King's Speech,"1. The actors - Firth compels attention and sympathy, Rush is irresistible, and Bonham Carter brightens every scene she enters. The supporting roles are studded with familiar British actors (Jacoby, Ely, etc.) being, and celebrating being, very British. 2. The visual experience - Scene after scene that is arresting. Shades of gray predominate. I particularly liked the royal car being led through foggy London streets. 3. The story - Revisits familiar dramatic ground, the lead up to the war and the English royal family, but finds new life by focusing on the future King's struggle to live up to the role thrust upon him 4. The writing - Provides a string of satisfying payoffs on the way to a solid dramatic conclusion, with witty repartee between the principles that is amusing but never overdone 5. The period - Costumes,settings, radio paraphernalia, autos, streets, palaces, royal hobby horses, ordinary British homes, everything fits together to conjure the time, which is really starting to feel distant.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
the king speech,"Excellent film The performance of the actors in the film was excellent. The story of the film was interesting. The atmosphere of the film was excellent.

A Personal Challenge Turned into a Universal Story,"The King's Speech might not seem, at first glance, like the kind of story that would keep an audience glued to the screen. A stammering monarch facing his fear of public speaking could easily have remained a mere historical curiosity. But what truly makes this film stand out is how it transforms such a simple premise into a gripping drama, and much of that success lies in the performances and the storytelling.Geoffrey Rush, portraying the unconventional speech therapist Lionel Logue, fills the screen with warmth and a sense of humor that pleasantly contrasts with the rigidity of the royal setting. The chemistry between Logue and King George VI, masterfully played by Colin Firth, is the beating heart of the film. Their scenes together carry an almost theatrical energy, where respect and friendship build naturally with each encounter, effortlessly guiding the viewer from laughter to heartfelt emotion.Tom Hooper's direction strikes a balance between historical accuracy and emotional intimacy. The camera lingers close on the characters during their most vulnerable moments, allowing the audience to feel the king's anxiety and pressure with every word he struggles to pronounce. The production design and period details enhance the narrative without overwhelming it, creating a backdrop that supports the story without distraction.While some may argue that the film follows familiar formulas of British period cinema, what sets it apart is its ability to humanize historical figures. This isn't just about a king delivering a speech; it's the story of a man confronting his own limitations, supported by an unexpected friendship.The King's Speech is a testament to how an apparently small story can carry a powerful, universal resonance. It's not only about personal triumph but also about how support and trust can transform lives-even in the most unlikely corners of royalty.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Heartfelt, moving drama","The true-life story of one man's journey to overcome a speech impediment, with the added twist that that man just so happens to be the king of England. This is carefully crafted, emphasising characterisation over drama or action and with a wonderful and engaging script (incredible to believe that David Seidler's prior screenplay to this was the David Carradine vehicle KUNG FU KILLER).Colin Firth gives a pitch perfect performance as King George VI, a man beset by worries both internal and external. One thing I liked about the script is that it never seeks to paint the king as a man above all others: instead he's completely human, often displaying petulance, temper tantrums and arrogance as well as the courage and bravery we expect from the story. Geoffrey Rush steals every one of his scenes as the impish speech therapist, and he also gives the best I've seen from him. So check out THE KING'S SPEECH, a film that keeps on giving and giving; you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"More often than not, the success of a movie can be attributed to its director. This time, it's the actors.","More often than not, the success of a motion picture can be attributed to the discipline and talents of the director. Obviously, there are many other people involved--hundreds, often--but the man yelling ""Cut!"" and ""Action!"" will often, with a good script at hand, also judge whether his project will be a success or a failure. That is the case most of the time, but not with ""The King's Speech."" Rather, the directing, by Tom Hooper, is rather pretentiously artsy, like something from a second-rate avant-garde movie. So he can not, as far as I am concerned, be awarded for the overall success of this movie (I'm talking about aesthetics, not the Oscars) but rather, the actors.The people in ""The King's Speech"" make good acting look easy. They include Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham-Carter, and Michael Gambon. Firth tackles the tricky role of playing King George VI, a monarch who had a famous speech handicap: he could hardly utter a sentence without stuttering. I'm not an authority on British history, but as the movie tells the story, it is shortly before Britain's involvement in World War II, and Mr. Firth is near the time where he must speak to the entire world. To help him, his wife (Miss Bonham-Carter) enlists the assistance of a speech therapist (Mr. Rush), who forms a friendship with the king.Some might be affronted by ""The King's Speech""'s apparent lack of concern about other historical matters at the time its story takes place. Chiefly, how King George VI appears to have been more concerned about eradicating his stutter as opposed to governing a country and leading them into war against Adolf Hitler. This is the overall concern of the picture; it might as well have been a fictional story about a fictional man just wanting to speak better. That may also be one of its weaknesses, and why it did not involve me on a broader scale.But involved I was in the dynamic between Mr. Firth as the king and Mr. Rush as the therapist who helps him. They have such strong chemistry together and play off their costar's personalities so efficiently. Mr. Firth, in particular, is wonderful in the movie. It is difficult to effectively play a person with a handicap. Many times, an actor will just succumb into ham-acting or play-acting. Not here. Mr. Firth, with his dialogue-driven character, convinced me in every shot that he was a human being with a speaking problem. Geoffrey Rush plays the wise but eccentric doctor without being ostentatious or smarmy. Miss Bonham-Carter, most of the time, is effective. She just occasionally slides into her bizarre alter-ego which has undoubtedly been influence of her involvement in so many Tim Burton movies. But again, that only shows here and there. Most of the time, she's very good as well.But directing in any movie, good or bad, cannot be ignored. Therefore, I must elaborate my severe reservations about Tom Hooper's handling of the material in ""The King's Speech."" It's a nightmare: too pretentious, too playful, too kidding, too clumsy. It's almost as if Mr. Hooper had, for the first time in his life, stumbled upon the variety of lenses and focus tricks that can be done with a motion picture camera and just let the creative monster in him come out without a leash on. There is nothing wrong with being inventive or clever, as long as there is a mind behind it. Mr. Hooper seems far less interested in his story than he does in tinkering around with lenses and oddball misc-en-scene.The first appointment scene between Mr. Firth and Mr. Rush is really distracting, as the director stages his cameras so that the actors on the opposite side of the screen that we expect. Example: Mr. Firth is in the left side of the screen, looking to the edge of the lenses, which is just two inches from his nose. Vice versa for Mr. Rush. If this was intended to give a sense of awkwardness, it only worked in terms of how uncomfortable it made me feel watching the scene.There are countless other distracting shots. Tracking shots upon a wall and back meant to convey a long stretch of time. Weird angles just showing off speaking equipment. Fish-eye shots of large crowds. All so pretentiously artsy, as opposed to creative in a controlled manner, that it really did wear me thin after a while. Had a more disciplined director been given the job, ""The King's Speech"" might have excelled from a perfectly-decent movie to an overall great one. Then again, many people would say that it has and in today's world, majority rules. So, what do I know?",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Basically a filmed stage-play,"I must admit to a disappointment after all the hype, although it is gratifying that so many find this piece -which depends on words, intelligence and character rather than mindless spectacle- so satisfying. My problem was seeing this as an essentially cinematic experience rather than a TV film.The static quality of many of the scenes -usually set in Geoffrey Rush's rooms- and the limited amount of main characters, reveals the source of this piece as a stage work albeit fleshed out slightly for the cinema. This lack of on screen action does make the film drag in a few places although usually covered up by the bravura performances of the leads.The script is not so good as many would have you believe and contains several implausibilities and historical inaccuracies. Churchill for instance almost destroyed his career by siding with the previous king not with the one depicted here. Certain important historical events are at best shaded in rather than explained in depth. It is also to be doubted how familiar Geoffrey Rush would be with his king in 1930's England with its rigid class system.The performances are however superb, flawless and dazzling with Helena Bonham Carter and Colin Firth hitting exactly the right tone. The finale, with the The King delivering his inspirational eve of war is stirring indeed. I felt my spine tingle and tears well up.As a metaphor for overcoming one's life obstacles through perseverance, this is hard to fault although its general slowness and lack of interesting settings will not be to everyone's taste.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Chemistry between two of the finest actors on earth spectacular,"My wife and I see over 100 movies a year, having been in the business and now retired. WE DO NOT READ ANY REVIEWS BY ANYONE. WE TRY TO TELL OUR FRIENDS THAT A CRITIC IS ONE PERSON, HE OR SHE IS NOT US. Critics are also a dying breed as newspapers disappear.Therefore, our critique is not biased and based on actually seeing the movie in a theatre. Many critics see the movies 5 at a time in a viewing room.Not a real atmosphere to gauge audience reaction. How can you review a movie without the real deal? Geoffrey Rush is the top actor of our generation with only Daniel Day Lewis as a compliment. The man is superb and Colin Firth is equal to the task. The chemistry between the two is poignant, funny, agonizing and it results in another Academy Award movie and nominations for both.What a positive joy to see this movie with such great actors. Helena Bonham Carter is also her usual fantastic, she is just a fine fine actress. Kudo's to whomever put these guys together. Firth has made quite a few films, but not that approach this one.Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
54th BFI London Film Festival - Excellent Film,"This year at the BFI London Film Festival, one of my favorite films was The King's Speech. It's the story of King George VI (Colin Firth) and his reluctant rise to become the King of England after his brother King Edward the VIII (Guy Pearce) abdicates the throne to marry the twice divorced Wallis Simpson . It's a great story of an unlikely and hesitant hero who suffers with a debilitating stammer. Seeking the help of an unorthodox speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) endeavors to help the then Prince of York with his ever increasing responsibilities of delivering live speeches over the radio. Colin Firth delivers an extremely convincing performance with stammers and pregnant pauses during his public and radio speeches that come across as genuinely painful to watch. His loving and supportive wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) stands by his side with encouragement as the looming pressure of becoming King and the need to vocally address his people only exacerbate the stammering problem. The charming relationship of Lionel and Bertie (Lionel Longue and King George) is a fascinating development as Lionel insists upon a very familiar and equal relationship in order for his therapy to work. The film poignantly points out the contrast of the overwhelming difficulty for the King of England to speak and the overpowering oration skills of Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini. In one scene the royal family is watching a news real of Hitler giving a very impassioned and dynamic speech as only Adolf Hitler could do, and the King's daughter asks her father what he is saying. King George enviously replies, ""I don't know, but he seems to be saying it rather well."" Director Tom Hooper was at the BFI London Film Festival to talk about the film and mentioned that King George VI was writer David Seidler's hero and inspiration as a child because he used to listen to the King on the radio during WWII reassuring himself that if the King of England could cope with a stammer so could he. Eventually Seidler set out to write about King George VI and found that Lionel Logue's son had his diary but would not hand it over without permission from the palace. To his delight the Queen Mother replied giving him permission but asked if he would not release anything in her life time because the memory was still so painful. David Seidler kept his word and in 2005 began writing a screen play that turned into a stage play and finally back into a screen play. This was a truly delightful film to watch, supported by a powerful cast and for many people this film will be like an enjoyable course in English History for Dummies as the history and drama of King George's brother abdicating the throne and Adolf Hitler threatening to plunge Europe into a Second World War unfold in a very personal story of struggle.by Shane Kester",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
needed more,"The King's Speech was nicely photographed and gave us some insights into the period leading up to World War II. But the story was too narrowly focused on its principle subject and could have really benefited from a sub plot or diversion to give us some contrast and more historical insight. So yeah, it was a bit boring. Predicably the movie begins with a badly given speech and ends with (oh sorry, I guess this might be a spoiler here) a well given speech. Is this a spoiler? Ha! Anyone could have predicted that, so I don't see how it could be! But anyway, worth a look but pretty much what you get is what you would expect to get.

Colin Firth's Outstanding delivery of The King's Speech!,"This is one of those movies that you avoid just because, there's not a particular reason cause you built it up in your mind that it's not good, although you haven't seen even a trailer of it. Then when you finally take the courage up to see it, IT BLOWS YOU AWAY saying WHERE HAVE I BEEN EARLIER?The intro and the setting into the story while building it up might take a little while to get you interested in the movie... but don't loose hope. Cause just when you think of stopping the film, the story starts to develop itself and Colin Firth's magic performance starts to weigh in.I never heard about King George VI before, certainly from now on I will read more about him. See, this is the the beautiful thing about movies, especially biopics. They make you be interested in something you wouldn't have been, have you not seen the movie about that person or about a thing.The stammer that King George VI had is undoubtedly performed with a great power by Colin. His mannerisms, pressure, fear, attitude, growth, confidence raising up, delivering the speech, getting louder and secured by each word whilst speaking... and the final ENCORE ....ahhhh MIND BLOWING.This has all the elements that you expect in a film, insecurity, developing confidence, growing confidence and feeling secure and lastly exploding like a boy becoming a man he is destined to be.Geoffrey Rush on the other hand just like a lead needs a supporter behind him, stand behind him he shall. Geoffrey is known for getting into any character comedy, drama, thriller ... anything. So it wasn't a problem for him to deliver his performance and also catch your eye even though he isn't the lead. His portrayal of Logue was outstanding and a greater push and support of Colin's character and also the film itself.Ignore the intro, suffer through it cause then it'll get better and by the end you will be satisfied that you watched it.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Oscar bait?  Yes.  But good show all round.,"I went to see The King's Speech with my dad and grandmother today. It lived up to my expectations: a lovely movie, and currently one of my top 5 favorites from this year. If I had one criticism, it would be that the film seemed to milk the emotion of certain scenes a bit too much: quicker cutaways would have made certain scenes just a wee bit better. But in general everything was excellent. The script was sharp and witty, the cinematography quite pleasing (although there were far too many shots with a person on the far left side of the screen to my tastes, and nothing to the right), the music beautiful (both the Beethoven excerpts and Alexandre Desplat's original score), and the acting was, of course, superb. Colin Firth, to my mind, has been coasting on his Mr. Darcy image for the last decade or so, with a steady diet of light romantic fare that doesn't really show him at his best. As the stuttering George VI, he is definitely working in a new direction. And the resultant performance is superb. In a role like this, one could easily resort to caricature -- Firth doesn't even brush with it. The last ten minutes alone may win him his long-awaited Oscar.Geoffrey Rush may also run away with a little golden statue this year: he is by turns funny, wry, and sympathetic as Lionel Logue, and his scenes with Firth are invariably the highlights of the film. Helena Bonham Carter gives one of her most effective performances in recent memory as George's wife (the current queen mother); I only wish that one of her lines from the trailer had been left in, in which she says, ""I intend to be a very good queen ... to a very great king"" -- that simple cut may have cost her an Oscar.Out of the other actors, Guy Pearce stands out for his brash and irresponsible Edward VIII. But really the whole cast is culled out of the depths of the British acting aristocracy: Derek Jacobi, Jennifer Ehle, Michael Gambon, Claire Bloom, Timothy Spall, Anthony Andrews ... the names just keep coming.Credit must go to director Tom Hooper for putting together such a wonderful film. This is only his third film, and the first to get any sort of major press, but he has had an award-winning TV career with such dramas as John Adams, Elizabeth I, and one of my favorite miniseries of all time, Daniel Deronda. It's nice to see his work on the big screens at last. The guy's a genius, and I'll definitely be looking forward to what he puts out next.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
One of my favourite movies of 2010,"I had wanted to see The King's Speech ever since it came out in cinemas, and after seeing it I was so glad I did. Was it over-hyped? Perhaps a tad, but you can say that for any of the movies that were nominated for Best Picture. Also, I had no problem whatsoever with its Best Picture win, as along with Social Network and a couple of other movies The King's Speech in my opinion was one of the stronger films of the year.Many people on here have raved about it being well made, well acted and very moving. I agree with that sentiment wholeheartedly. I respectfully disagree with those who say it is this year's Shakespeare in Love(an unfair comparison in the first place, besides Shakespeare in Love I think gets too much hate on here) or the worst Best Picture winner since Crash(that's The Hurt Locker, The King's Speech is one of the better ones).As I have said, The King's Speech is one of my favourites of 2010. One of the main reasons why it is so is the emotional impact this film has. Although the subject matter mayn't appeal to some, I think The King's Speech has a very moving, inspiring and personal story. Thanks to some of the writing and music especially, there are a number of very poignant scenes and little things. Not just the build up to the finale, which was an example of direction at its finest, but also the penguin story which was funny, touching and adorable all at once. I wish to say out of all the movies released last year, only Toy Story 3 and Another Year came close to how deeply moving and touching The King's Speech was.The script is very well-written. It is one that is full of intelligent dialogue, and also the dialogue has its amusing, thoughtful and very poignant moments. Examples are any exchange between Bertie and Lionel and of course the very stirring scene with the speech. Although some mayn't agree with me, I loved the score. Alexandre Desplat's score is one that is sensitive and positively hypnotic. It wasn't just the score though, the use of Beethoven's 7th Symphony and Emperor Concerto also gave the scenes they featured in plenty of emotion.The King's Speech is a very well-made film also. There may be those who argue the production values are reminiscent of that of a TV movie, if so in my mind it is reminiscent of a TV movie with good production values. The lighting wasn't dull and the scenery and sets are lavish and evoke the period beautifully, almost like seeing the best of a beautifully-made Agatha Christie adaptation for instance. The production values are captured wonderfully by the skillful cinematography, with the powerful end shot of Lionel especially resonating. Tom Hooper's direction is very fine, not too low-key but never self-indulgent, the aforementioned build up to the finale shows this perfectly, and the film while elegiac is paced wonderfully.The acting is one of The King's Speech's strengths. Colin Firth is just fantastic in the lead and delivers enough poignancy and pathos to make us empathise with him. Geoffrey Rush matches him perfectly by being amusing without being over-the-top and sympathetic without being manipulative. Helena Bonham Carter while perhaps underused in comparison also makes an impression in an atypical role, in the finale for example the look she gives Firth is just one of those little things that makes me struggle to refrain from choking up. There is also a solid supporting cast, Guy Pearce is good, Michael Gambon is excellent and Timothy Spall does well considering how easily he could have gone into caricature(and I can understand why people have said he did).In conclusion, a wonderful movie and one of the best of the year. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
What was there to be patriotic about?,"Having dabbled in public speaking, I have come to the view that there are three kinds of people who practise it: the brave, the egotistical and the downright foolish. For King George VI, it was a duty.When King George V dies, the crown is passed to his eldest son, Edward VIII. Desperate to marry a divorcée he abdicates the throne, allowing his stammering brother Prince Albert, later George VI, to take over. At her wits end about how to cure her husband's unallowable defect, Queen Elizabeth enlists the help of maverick speech therapist, Lionel Logue.I've got used to the fact that many – or is it all? – ladies (and no doubt some men too) regard Colin Firth as their sunlit dream, and frankly I don't care anymore. It is my duty to point out, however, knowing it is akin to treason, that he does not deserve the Oscar. Geoffrey Rush as Logue not only dominates, but shines (pun intended) as the riposting Aussie. It's telling that the camera ends on his face.The other players should be congratulated. Michael Gambon's George V is authoritative; Guy Pierce, who has a face like a greyhound's, embodies the sybaritic Edward VIII with gusto; and Helena Bonham Carter is her usual jaunty self as Queen Elizabeth. Only Timothy Spall's hackneyed turn as Winston Churchill blemishes the ensemble.The appearance and zeitgeist of the age is ably captured – surely this is getting harder as we move further away from the period. Filming is bravura at times, notably scenes exemplifying the fear of speaking publicly, though at other moments I thought I was watching a BBC drama. Some superfluous dialogue made me cringe. It moves along at a gentle pace and is unpretentious.The general rule seems to be: The more afflicted the character, the deeper our sympathy. This was true of 'The Elephant Man', 'My Left Foot' and 'I Am Sam'. Here, the affliction is minor, and so is our sympathy. Firth's portrayal of George VI is flagrantly mediocre. What does he do? Stammers inconsistently, swears when Rush's mad methods are too much, and delivers a few speeches, showing only nascent progress. What was there to be patriotic about when this guy was at the helm?www.scottishreview.net",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A touching historical drama,"This film is about King George VI and his long battle to overcome his stammer.I like the ""The King's Speech"", as it can be interpreted in two ways: the speech that the king gives, and the king's way of speaking. The film is about both of these interpretations. It is quite an achievement to make something that does not sound so interesting into something so captivating and touching. King George VI's lack of confidence and his fragile psychological state is well portrayed by Colin Firth. He has the charisma, charm and acting skills to make his character so interesting and sympathetic. He shows that human side of a supposedly strong character well. ""The King's Speech"" is a touching historical drama.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Likable but shallow,"I enjoyed this film but apart from Geoffrey Rush's fine acting and some amusing snippets of dialogue, it did not strike me as an Oscar contender.The film covers the period between the end of the reign of George V and the early days of George VI (Colin Firth).Firth plays Prince Albert (""Bertie"" who later took the name of George on his coronation) as a character demanding our sympathy. A young man struck by a debilitating stammer from childhood who was never expected to become king.Apart from the speeches, which are part of the historical record, all the dialogue comes from the writer's imagination. Not in itself a bad thing but some of the exchanges appeared unlikely.Go and see by all means but don't expect to remember it a few days later.Edited 28 February 2011: Shows how much I know!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Is it the very best of the film nominated in 2011? Maybe, maybe not--but even if it isn't the very best, it's certainly close. As for all the film I've seen that were nominated for Best Picture it's at least my second favorite--right behind ""The Black Swan"" and just ahead of ""Winter's Bone"". The bottom line is that Colin Firth did a marvelous job--as did Geoffrey Rush. It's wonderfully entertaining, well made and does something rare for a film--it humanizes the monarchy.

George VI And His Therapist,"With what I understand was the approval of the Royal Family, The King's Speech sets out to set the historical record straight about the father of the present Queen Elizabeth. George VI of the United Kingdom never thought he would be the ruling monarch, but when the challenge came, he rose to it. He was the second surviving son of George V and Queen Mary and like the present royal princes, Andrews and Edward, did the usual good will things on behalf of the Royal Family, substituting whenever the monarch or his brother the Crown Prince was not available.For Colin Firth as George, life took an incredible bounce as his father Michael Gambon as George V said it would if the Prince of Wales later Edward VIII took the throne. Given his cavalier attitude and irresponsibility about assuming his duties George V knew something would happen.The something was American divorcée Wallis Warfield Simpson played here by Eve Best ever so briefly, but deliciously. Her erotic technique could not be beat and that's what got Guy Peace as Edward VIII panting after her. Her friendship with Nazis and their collaborators worried quite a few in the British establishment. I'm glad that The King's Speech brought this one, I'm a firm believer that once all documents are released Stanley Baldwin and the rest of the cabinet who stood with him against this marriage will be heroes for posterity.We in America have long been big believers in that myth perpetuated about the Windsors about the king who gave up his throne for the woman he loved. This film is the Royal Family's Way of setting the historical record straight.But Colin Firth did have an incredible problem of stammering and could not cure it. George VI never really did, but after trying many people his wife Helena Bonham Carter in the film came upon Geoffrey Rush who was not a professional therapist. He was something better it turned out, an actor and an intuitive psychologist to boot. His scenes with Firth trying to limit the stammer are the best in the film.Second best in the film are the scenes of Firth and Bonham-Carter with their two daughters, the older of whom became the present Queen. She's the only one left who was present at these events. After the playboy Edward VIII, the Royals became a beloved institution of family stability during George VI's reign. They stayed in London, in Buckingham Palce, during the Blitz and toured the city constantly keeping up the morale of the populace. No ruler with real political power did more for his people.The King's Speech got four Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor for Colin Firth, Best Director for Tom Hooper and for David Seaton's Original Screenplay. It had a flock more nominations including Best Supporting Actor and Actress for Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham-Carter. One role should not be overlooked either, that of Derek Jacobi as an obsequious Archbishop of Canterbury. I wasn't familiar with him, but was he really that much of toady?And this review from this American viewer from a country that got rid of the British monarchy dedicates this review to George VI of the United Kingdom.

Its not about Oscars,"The are few roles in movie history which define an actor. Scoring the winner in the World Series or sinking the putt on the last day of Augusta. These things catapult the achiever to the highest level, to the the top of their profession. When faced with this opportunity, some falter, some do not possess the metal to finish and but a small few, succeed. Their reward is the admiration of all true fans, the trepidation of the established champions and the self-belief which will sustain the winner in the upper echelons.When Colin Firth first read this script he could only have thought that his moment had come, that this opportunity could be his defining role. For no story rooted in such a critical moment in history is more fascinating and yet moving. Others faced with such an opportunity have not excelled - for instance, Helen Mirren's portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in the days after the death of Princess Diana. Firth reaches out and grabs this role with both hands until he has the audience eating out of his.Geoffrey Rush was a brave casting decision as the counterpoint between such different actors could so easily have annoyed the viewer. Yet together they played a touching portrayal of a friendship based on mutual respect and laterally, on admiration.Helena Bonham-Carter conveys perfectly the difficult balance for wives in those times - who must know their place and yet also know exactly when to be steadfast without undermining their husband.This movie springs from the great tradition of many British productions. Only British cinema has such a rich heritage in portraying triumph in a time of adversity. From the great libraries of war movies like Ice Cold in Alex, through modern day classics such as Chariots of Fire, The Kings Speech will take its place proudly at the top table.To Colin Firth, winning the Oscar is somewhat incidental. This actor knows he gave of his best, that after this he will be acclaimed by the king-makers of Hollywood and further afield. He has lifted the heavy mantle of 'the great British actor who has never played an epic role'. He will now have his chance to establish himself with Sir John Gielgud and Lord Lawrence Olivier. Ironically, he will receive his own Royal honor from Elizabeth II well in advance of attaining such legendary status.Finally, for all those who struggle with their own speech, both physically and metaphorically, let this be both an inspiration and a refuge. A reason to hope and a reason to persevere. For the rest of us we can live the moment, the torment and the triumph...and for once, no one can say that it isn't as good as the book!

The movie has a very predictable plot, but still it stands out among the other movies released this year.

Oscar jury is going to have a tough time deciding the best actor award unlike last year.

"A touch over-hyped but a high-calibre film across the board – accessible, enjoyable and engaging","There was a section in The Times this morning that stated that, two weeks after release, 1 out of every 20 people in the UK had seen this film. My first attempt to see it (at an off-peak showing) failed as it was sold out, partly as a result of the film having almost nothing but positive things about it and if the Oscars do not give it a couple then the Bafta's will almost certainly make sure it has a few awards on its poster when it comes to time to sell the DVD. So it was a little hard for me to come to this film with an open mind, since every bus shelter, magazine and poster is busy telling me how amazing it is. I came to it with a bit of cynicism though, since it is awards season and at this time of year we do see plenty of ""worthy"" films that everyone praises but ultimately don't deliver in the longer term.This cynicism wasn't helped by the film appearing to have what it takes to appeal to as many viewers as possible and also be classic awards-friendly material. This cynicism didn't last very long though because it had been forgotten to be replaced by how engaged and rather charmed I was by this film. The basic plot sees Duke of York struggling to overcome his stammer – with a long line of failed attempts and discarded doctors. Eventually he ends up at the door of unorthodox doctor Lionel Logue – an Australian of all things – and, while progress appears possible if the Duke can let go, events conspire to make progress even more important than ever. It tells this story with a surprising amount of humour and drama, making it accessible and modern, without totally moving away from being reasonably true to the characters and the time.It doesn't have quite the complexity that I had hoped from the hype but it is engaging throughout and all that it does works well. Moments of insight (fictional or not I don't know) into the King come infrequently but they are very well done when they come, while the comedy is appropriate and is written and delivered within the story so that it never feels separate from it. Seidler's script is certainly ""good"" and he does well to capture this piece of history but I don't think that the film represents a brilliant piece of writing as some have said. Hooper's direction is good and I particularly liked some of his shot framing – characters off-centre from solo shots, good use of the tremendous sets etc. However where the film deserves praise without doubt is in the performances.Firth is a definite Bafta winner and looks very good for the Oscar and not just because of who he plays but how he plays it. He is engaging, sympathetic and he convinces in his stammer and his character. It is not a novelty act and he does feel like a real person. Most importantly he plays very well with Rush, who himself is great here – getting the pitch just right to bring a light and warm touch to the shared scenes. Bonham-Carter is enjoyable in support and of course, being a British film we have plenty of faces doing solid turns (Jacobi, Gambon, Spall etc). Pearce is a nice find and he provides a solid turn as well.Overall The King's Speech is not the greatest film ever made and those claiming such have perhaps been caught up in the hype as much as those currently placing it high up the IMDb top 250 list! However it is a very good film as it provides an engaging narrative that is personal while also being clear in its national importance. It does this in an accessible and engaging manner with humour and drama used well – everything is of a high calibre here and it produces a total produce that is as well. The performances make it work as well as it does and the film is charming, enjoyable and very British. A tad over-hyped at the moment but still a film worthy of the attention given to it.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"""The N-N-N-azis are C-C-Coming!""","This film had me in its pocket for the first half hour or so. It depicts 1930s London in a grimly authentic way and Helena Bonham Carter is a rather fetching Queen Mother. Firth holds the screen and the two kids - one of them from Outnumbered, the other looking like a young Lily Allen - are charming. I enjoyed the relationship between the excellent Geoffrey Rush and Firth, even if it's a reversal of My Fair Lady, the commoner advising the posho on speech.Then Michael Gambdon's King George V is wheeled out to deliver the most awful leaden-footed exposition, all about how Germany is in enthral to the Nazis and how Bertie's feckless brother is involved with this Wallis woman. Oh, it's going to be one of those films is it, I thought, and I was right. Though Firth and Rush continue to be very good, every so often there's this cack-handed exposition, a character popping up to deliver a Ladybird book version of history, to remind us why it's important that the second in line gets his elocution right. It's not really too accurate as this takes place in the mid-1930s, when Hitler really wasn't seen as that much of a threat, especially by the Royal family. Certainly Baldwin, the Prime Minister, had no particular opinion on him as yet, so they're truncating events big time. Okay, Churchill is wheeled out to say the same thing, (Timothy Spall in a role that could be out of Comic Strip) but Churchill was seen as a dog barking at the moon back then.Exposition is like a hairpiece, if you notice it it's not doing its job right.We're artlessly spoonfed information as to why Wallis Simpson is A Bad Person, just mean to accept it like some gullible courtier. With a line thrown in for American audiences: ""It's not that she's American..."" It's all too broadly written.Otherwise just as Rush was too old to be Peter Sellers in his biopic, Firth is surely way too old to be the Bertie and looks a lot older than Guy Pearce, who is meant to be his older brother. Anthony Andrews pops up as Baldwin and is unreconisable from his Bridehead days. Actually there's the sense that this script has been on the backburner for so long, Andrews might have been considered for the role of King Edward 20 years ago, and Pride and Prejudice's Jennifer Ehle, who is Logie's wife in this, would have made a decent fist of Wallis Simpson's bony carnality. And Firth would have been the right age.By this time I was recasting the film in my mind, and came up with Brit comic David Mitchell as Bertie (the same voice as Firth) and his Peep Show compadre Robert Webb as the rakish, carefree Edward, that would have worked rather well. The whole thing at times had the feel of Churchill: The Movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Very predictably, the two have a difficult meet-cute, soon to become involved in therapeutic matters, and fast friends by the end of the movie.Most of their scenes are shot in interiors and revolve around Albert's gloomy childhood and his present shortcomings – he has a very nasty temper. Logue acts more as a psychiatrist than a speech therapist, encouraging Albert to let go of the past and build strength for the present and the future.Even trying very hard, it is difficult to sympathize with the future king, whose biggest problems were a cold mother, a nasty nanny and a dashing brother, making fun of him. Also, English snobbery it is not particular fun to watch, except maybe if you are British upper-class.The movie has a very slow pace, a great photography (a lot of frames could be used as stand-alone photos) and interesting use of light. Colin Firth is indeed very good, playing a part that must be a once in a lifetime opportunity for an actor. If he is going to win an Oscar, he certainly deserves it, but I liked him more in a ""Single man"". Geoffrey Rush is equally good and Guy Pierce excellent, as bad boy David. Helena Bonham Carter is scary, as usual. On the whole, a slightly boring, pointless movie, with great performances.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Fantastic,"I love this period of the 20th century and this movie does not let history down. A must see with parts that brings tears to ones eye with that passionate speech at the end. A brilliant speech in its own right, and with the passions of someone, of people not with the King's best interest wanted to see fail, overcame all the adversity and stood up proud and strong and gave a speech that moved England's troops in the dark days of WW2.This Monarch is one of a kind who overcame his issues to put Hitler in his place; history records the rest. I tend to think had this Monarch not stood up to the plate, England's Monarchy might not have been the only thing ruined. In hind sight the commonwealth is better for the world at large but these were testy times and this movie does history proud service to this era. Great movie I will see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Visually stunning, beautifully written, fantastically acted; 2nd best film of the year","Despite all of its lavish production values, The King's Speech greatest asset and strongest suit is its fantastic script, written by David Seidler. In the spirit of his contemporary, Peter Morgan (writer of The Queen, Frost/Nixon and other great films), and also The Social Network, Seidler takes what would seemingly be a very trivial anecdote – King George VI of England's speech therapy sessions – and manages to create a genuinely compelling and fascinating drama out of it. Like Aaron Sorkin's script for The Social Network, Seidler manages to take this unconventional premise and find the classic dramatic arc within it. Structurally, The King's Speech is one of the best screenplays in recent memory. The king is faced with a number of obstacles that he needs to overcome in order to achieve his goal, and as the film goes along and he gets help from the people around him, he learns how to change and eventually moves on. I think that recently, many writers have forgotten about the basic elements of storytelling required to create something truly engaging. Many directors these days rely purely on visuals to tell their stories. But film is just as much a written medium as it is a visual one.However, that isn't to say that The King's Speech doesn't deliver on the visual level as well. Directed with signature flair by up-and-comer Tom Hooper, the film is one of the most visually stunning I have seen all year. Hooper, who has only directed one feature prior to this but enjoyed a very prolific television career, having directed the Elizabeth I mini-series with Helen Mirren as well as the monumental John Adams mini-series for HBO, has, in a relatively short amount of time, managed to develop a very distinct and strikingly beautiful visual style. In this film, he goes all-out with his camera placement and movement: Wide-angle lenses, lengthy steadicam shots, off-center compositions, beautiful settings, gorgeous, naturalistic side-lighting all of these elements come together to create a rich, beautiful, almost Kubrickian visual style. It is exactly the type of visual style I personally enjoy, and it is a thrill to see a director (and cinematographer) take such a loose and dynamic approach to material that otherwise could have come across as very stiff. Of course, the beautiful locations and fantastic and lavish production design and costume design only further compliment the cinematography. Another important element that enriches the dynamics of the film is Alexandre Desplat's beautiful, understated score, which combines his own compositions with fantastic pieces of classical music that really work well to enhance the emotions of the story.In costume dramas, the acting is often just as if not more prominent than the cinematography, costume and set design, and The King's Speech is no exception. At the center of the film are two monumental performances from two of the greatest actors working today: Colin Firth, whom I still believe deserved the Oscar last year for his sublime turn in Tom Ford's A Single Man, and whom I believe deserves the Oscar this year for his equally sublime performance as King George VI. Firth not only embodies and captures the monarch in terms of his stammer and other mannerisms, but also really breathes life and emotion into a man facing a heavy burden, caught in conflict, having to overcome a large number of obstacles including his debilitating stutter but also being belittled by his older brother and father, not having the faith of his people, and needing to win back that faith with the one thing he can't do: public speaking. Complimenting and almost completing his performance is an equally fantastic turn from Geoffrey Rush, who delivers one of his best performances yet as the king's speech therapist. The dynamic between the two of them is one of the best I have seen between two characters in any film this year; they riff and play off one another in just the perfect way, and their initial animosity turned bonding is simply wonderful to watch unfold. Rounding out the supporting cast are wonderful performances from Helena Bonham-Carter as the king's loving wife (and future Queen Mother), and Guy Pearce as King George's snooty, outrageous brother who is more obsessed with his married American socialite girlfriend than with actually doing a good job as monarch. It is a wonderful ensemble that works fantastically well together, and results in some of the best performances of the year.Although I would rank it up there with the likes of The Remains of the Day and Atonement, The King's Speech is also set apart from those movies for one important reason: It is funny, and certainly much funnier than I expected it to be. Some scenes had me in stitches on the floor: the cursing scene will go down as one of the best I have seen in any film this year. Whereas many costume dramas are heavy-handed and feature dreary, down endings, The King's Speech is quite optimistic: characters overcome their obstacles and we are genuinely happy to see them succeed. It almost seems like an oxymoron: A British costume drama crowd-pleaser. But The King's Speech is just that: A wildly enjoyable piece of entertainment, with a heart, a fantastic story and script, and beautiful production values, music and cinematography easily make this one of the best films of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Magnificent Film Based on a True Story,"In 1925, the Duke of York (Colin Firth) is stammerer and has troubles to speak to the public. His wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) seeks the treatment of the speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) that follows unconventional methods and relationship, and Bertie gives up the treatment on the first day. However, after listening to the session that was recorded by Lionel, the Duke returns to the treatment.In the mid 30's, the Duke of York is forced to assume the throne of England as King George VI due to the abdication of his older brother King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce). Immediately after, there is a crisis in the government and England declares war to Germany. King George VI needs to make a speech to his compatriots, and his friend Lionel helps him using an unorthodox technique.""The Speech of the King"" was the greatest winner of the 83th Oscar and is a magnificent film based on the biography of King George VI. I have not seen yet all the films nominated to the Oscar, but the excellent Colin Firth is really awesome in the role of King George VI. Helena Bonham Carter and Geoffrey Rush are also amazing in this historic drama. The tight direction of the unknown Tom Hooper is top-notch and the costumes and art direction are also fantastic. The speech of the king with the Seventh Symphony of Beethoven is touching and ends this film with golden key.

Helena Bonham Carter shines, when she is away from Tim Burton and his ""interesting"" choices, she glistens like a diamond on a sea of black velvet.

Just OK,"I'm predisposed to like anything with Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter. All give fine performances in this film. And I'm a fan of most British historical dramas. But this film just doesn't work for me. Prince/King has a stutter, works with coach to get it under control and that's the film. Nothing much happens. We walk away not knowing anything new about the King, the Monarchy, the UK, the speech coach, etc.My overwhelming reaction to this film was boredom. Nothing much happens. There's only one scene in the movie I found interesting. When the speech coach's wife returns home and finds the Queen of England sipping tea in her dining room, I actually had a chuckle or two.Watch if you're a fan of Firth or Rush -- their performances are noteworthy. Helena Bonham Carter is fine but her part is actually rather small. Alas, not much else to recommend it. Yes, I know I seem to be out of step with the IMDb voters and Academy Award nominators, but I just couldn't find a way to like this film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Good film badly marred by historical inaccuracies,"As I expected from the trailers and from the various comments and reviews I have read the film is rather a travesty of history, and utterly misrepresents the characters and events of the time. No surprise there then, since it is rare for a commercial feature film to portray historical events with any degree of verisimilitude.I think that Colin Firth is badly miscast as George, and though he struggles hard with the role he fails to convince chiefly because he is physically so wrong - too tall, too good-looking and altogether too commanding a physical presence. Also Helena Bonham-Carter is perhaps rather too pretty and shapely for Elizabeth. Others, too, are physically wrong for the roles they play, such as Baldwin and Churchill. Guy Pearce on the other hand is very convincing as the raffish and devil-may-care Edward (David) and in fact the believability of his portrayal tends to throw into sharper relief the ""wrongness"" of Firth as George, as for example, in the scene when Edward mocks and belittles him. The whole scene utterly fails to convince. Some of the other parts, however, are well played and a delight, especially Geoffrey Rush who is brilliant as Dr Logue (though I confess I have no idea what he was actually like), and it is interesting to see Ramona Marquez, so amazing in ""Outnumbered"" as Princess Margaret Rose.But much more important than the miscastings, is the general tone of the film and its misrepresentations of the political and social realities of the time. Crucially of course is its depiction of attitudes towards Nazi Germany and the looming threat of war. The film credits many characters, but especially George V (a bit of a dimwit by all accounts) with extraordinary political insight and prescience. He at one point foretells and rails against Britain being squeezed, politically, between Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia. The Royal Family are being recruited into the ranks of anti-appeasers, against all the evidence that they were generally rather non-political, and deeply conservative insofar as they were political at all. Certainly one cannot accept the idea of either George V or George VI as arch anti-appeasers. (At least this film was better, in this respect, than an ITV production I recall from a few years ago which has George, quite ludicrously and unhistorically, attacking Chamberlain's appeasement policy in conversation with Roosevelt on his American tour). The portrayal of Churchill as a supporter of George, when he was a die-hard supporter of the lost cause of Edward, is egregiously wrong. Many other things jar horribly, such as Baldwin ""telling"" George that Chamberlain is to succeed him as PM, rather than merely ""advising"" him as was of course the constitutional position. Most egregious of all the historical falsities is of course the final scene, which depicts an event which I am fairly sure never happened, namely the broadcast from Buckingham Palace to the nation on the outbreak of war. Of course it is understandable that the film-makers should need a climactic scene, for dramatic reasons, in which the ""hero"" overcomes the enemy, or in this case, overcomes his own weakness and inadequacy, and moreover does so in the context of using this personal triumph to rally the nation in a time of peril, for otherwise the film would just tend to trail away. But even if we are to accept this dramatic licence, I can scarcely believe that the broadcast would have happened in the way depicted, with George going out onto the balcony in front of a huge crowd of cheering people. This was horribly, crashingly, glaringly wrong. The nation was surely in a deeply sombre, despondent and apprehensive mood at this precise juncture, and no such scenes would have occurred. This was much more in keeping with the huge outpourings of celebration that occurred at the conclusion of the war, not at its commencement.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A must see movie,"I saw this movie in the middle of a French audience. They watched the original version with french subtitles. We were all rapt in the storyline, the actors, the script and the historical context. We laughed in all the right places, were spellbound by the 'Royal' touches, appreciated the personal drama. Excellent cast and dignified approach though my opinion of Edward V11 is now even lower and I'm not sure if that was a fair portrayal of him or not.Nicely uplifting. I ended up having a tear in my eye by the end, not so much because of the personal struggle portrayed but because it all happened at such a pivotal time in history ie there they were waving to the commoners from Buckingham Palace in those iconic poses. The issue of war brewing was chillingly portrayed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Astonishing film,"I won't go into detail about THE KING'S SPEECH after so many reviews in the media. I just wanted to say that this is a gem of a film, a MUST for anyone who enjoys top class British drama at its very best. The acting of the superb cast is as it should be - without fault. Colin Firth gives the performance of a lifetime and is a worthy candidate for the highest acting awards. I was also very impressed by Helena Bonham-Carter, who looks exactly like the Duchess of York, Guy Pearce, an amazing Duke of Windsor and the wonderful Geoffrey Rush, always so good in any part he plays. It is a pleasure to see that the British cinema is still producing films of this quality.I saw this film at one of the first showings in a Tel-Aviv, Israel suburb.

Simple but artistic,"I don't know how to start, I guess I'll start with the way the movie was shot. The shooting of the movie was tiring for me because the camera angles are a bit unorthodox, normally the camera shows the person in the middle or wherever they want us to focus. This movie does the opposite.After the first half hour, the tempo rises a little, but then drops again. The story is very simple and predictable in the first hour, of course the fact that it's a biopic also plays a part.One of the things I like about the movie is that it conveys to the audience that the kings have no qualifications, but that they are still important to the public.So do I recommend the movie?

Made for the Oscars,"This is a great movie. The idea of dealing with the year of the three kings (1936) is an original and a good idea, because lots of people ignore that part of British history. But I have mixed feelings, and I can't only praise that film. First, the strength of the movie. I can say that there are top notch actors. Colin Firth is gorgeous as Bertie, and I really think that he deserved an Oscar for his role. And the other actors are good too. Moreover, it is a sentimental movie, you can cry an laugh watching it (the British wit sometimes is awesome). But in spite of an original idea, the film is not original at all. The screenplay is a bit classic (It is expected to win lots of Oscars). Even if the film director has done a solid job, he has not taken any risk, so some moments can be boring. I can speak about one great moment (a little risky), when Bertie loosens up, and has a weird conversation with Logue. But I don't want to tell you the story, because that movie deserves a viewing, and even if it is short of some original shots and conversations, you leave the place full OK joy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The Man Who Wouldn't be King Earns the Right to Wear the Crown,"About every few years, a performance of exceptional depth, meaning, and transcendence crosses film and television screens, hopefully reminding us how powerful the medium can be to show us something about ourselves. Although these exceptional performances often concern historical figures, what they portray is the very human side of people we think of as being nearly timeless. Some which come to mind include Vivian Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, Glenda Jackson as Queen Elizabeth I, Ben Kingsley as Gandhi, Sean Penn as Harvey Milk, Forest Whitaker as Idi Amin, Helen Mirren as Elizabeth II, Paul Giamatti as John Adams, and Denzel Washington as Malcolm X. In 2010, this honor has to belong to Colin Firth as King George VI in ""The King's Speech"".The reason I believe ""The King's Speech"" is the best picture along with the best performance of 2010 lies not exclusively with Firth's outstanding performance as King George VI, which is exemplary by any standard. The whole tone and atmosphere of the King's Speech is about the English monarchy revealed. Within the high palace walls and glorious banners which have flown for centuries reside fallible human beings. These people, despite the limos and the embroidered ermine, have the same hopes, fears, challenges, and shortcomings which we all share. This film is about one of those born into what seems, from the outside, a life of pure splendor and privilege, and how that person had to cope with very serious shortcomings considering his position in the royal family.When he is born the second son of the man who would become King George V, it was understood that Bertie would never become king. His brother Edward was the heir presumptive and remained so until the mid-1930's. Bertie (Colin Firth), since early life, had a stammer (or stutter) while speaking, particularly in public situations. As I don't know this history, it sounds like his stammer wasn't taken so seriously because he would never be seated on the throne. But after a disastrous public-speaking engagement at Wembley Stadium in the 1920's, he seeks professional help. His wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) comes across a reputed speech therapist Lionel Logue (Jeffrey Rush in an equally compelling performance) who helped impaired World War I veterans regain their voices. Logue is a kind of real-life Professor Higgins (Pygmalion/My Fair Lady), although his intent is to help those with speech impediments.At first, Bertie wishes only to work on the physical aspects of speech with his new therapist. Logue agrees, provided their relationship is equal behind closed doors. The two work intensely every day to help the future monarch loosen his jaw, enunciate, and breathe more properly. But as the sessions progress and Logue learns more about his high-ranking client/patient, a deeper relationship emerges. And we begin to learn that Bertie did experience ill-treatment as a child which contributed to his stammer. The therapist realizes there is more to Bertie's stammer than mere physical defects.When his brother abdicates the throne in 1936, suddenly Bertie becomes George VI, King of England and Britain. I think George VI is one of the unsung heroes of World War II, often overshadowed by Churchill, Roosevelt and de Gaulle. Although he may have not engaged in a great act of heroism on the field, his willingness to improve himself because of his obligations as Britain's Head of State is a courageous act. His ability to communicate will become the voice of reassurance and resolve among the English-speaking world along with Churchill and Roosevelt against the fascist forces in Europe. A very slow but deliberate transformation occurs throughout the film in which Bertie is at first shy and nervous until he exceeds even his own expectations and becomes worthy to fill the shoes of those before him, worn by the likes of Queen Elizabeth I, King Charles II, Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, and his father King George V.A president doesn't exactly become president when he swears his oath of office, nor a king when he is crowned. These people become fused with their roles when they rise above their deficiencies and face their obstacles head on. As the man who wasn't supposed to be king, George VI rose to the occasion, shortcomings and all. At one point, his speech therapist says ""You're the most courageous man I know."" And that is the mark of a great man, king or otherwise.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Magnificent History of Modern Personal Bravery,"Although it's often called the most feared human task, public speaking is, nevertheless, a talent we expect of all modern leaders.In ""The King's Speech"", the British Duke of York, Albert (Colin Firth), is about to become the King of England (King George VI) at a time when the people who shared his destiny were the eloquent Winston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt and, yes, Adolf Hitler.But, Albert (also called Bertie by his family) is paralyzed to speak publicly at a time in media history when radio broadcasts were mobilizing people to hear inspiring messages from their leaders. Tragically, Albert is terrified of public speaking because of a serious speech stutter preventing him from expressing himself.Albert became an unwilling monarch when he inherited the British throne after his brother King Edward VIII abdicated to marry a twice divorced American woman from Baltimore named Wallis Simpson (Eve Best).Albert needed help. In desperation, he followed his wife, Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham-Carter) to visit an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). The two developed a relationship in spite of court critics who saw Logue's therapy as unqualified for a King.With great difficulty, Albert was slowly able to meet the challenges history presented him and his family. His personal bravery was well developed in the brilliant portrayal by actor Firth.What makes ""The King's Speech"" a great movie is the magnificent acting and casting, supported by a superb story about the salient qualities of leadership. Bertie learned to become the King of England because his country desperately needed him, and he rose to the occasion.English history buffs will relish the subtle comparison of King George VI to the life of Richard III, who was also afflicted, as portrayed by Shakespeare. Cinematography includes period alluring stage sets, complimented by impressive landmarks like Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abby and 10 Downing Street, each essential to the historic plot.What's missing from The King's Speech is a PG-13 rating, because the R is unjustified given the accuracy of the history revealed. Profanity in this film does not rise to an R rating level.How will young people learn about the flawed human condition of some of the world's great leaders if they are prevented from seeing such exquisite films, like ""The King's Speech"", due to the use of harsh language? Rather, The King's Speech should be required viewing for modern history classes with teacher supervision and guidance.Performances by Firth, Rush and Bonham-Carter are believable and superb. I especially enjoyed the scene when Albert's wife (Bonham-Carter) snubs Wallis Simpson (Eve Best) when she is greeted by the divorcée at a party.Today, speech therapy is a medical specialty that requires strict credentials by therapists and physicians. In 1939, however, Logue was the best therapist the terrified king could rely on. Thankfully, the two men's relationship therapeutically worked to help galvanize the British people around the world. In fact, the King's Speech on the radio inspired at a time when darkness and war prevailed.""The King's Speech"" is definitely a 10 star film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Bloody splendid movie,"I say, bloody splendid movie, old boy. That was my best proper British accent. What do you think?Although this isn't an action movie with cars exploding and spies trying to kill one another, I was riveted, on-the-edge-of-my-seat thrilled by this movie. The tension created by the marvelous performances of these brilliant actors was truly inspiring. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush made this material come alive. The back drop of this movie is also a very compelling moment in history. And a not so well known behind-the-curtain peek at the history of the royal family. ""It's pronounce Ma'am like ham not Ma'am like balm"" as the Queen would say to everyone she met. Any actor that wins an award for their performance in this movie should stand proud. I would even be alright with it winning best movie of the year ... but don't tell Christopher Nolan I said that.Odds and ends ... when I watch an ensemble piece like this I can't help but pigeon hole each actor into the first character I saw them play or the performance where I first became of aware of them by name. What I mean by that is every time I see Colin Firth, no matter what role he is playing, he is indelibly connected to his role as Mark Darcy in the movie Bridget Jones's Diary for that is the first performance where he managed to make an impression on me. For Geoffrey Rush it's Shine. For Helena Bonham Carter it's Fight Club. For Derek Jacobi it's The Odessa File. For Michael Gambon it's Gosford Park. And for Timothy Spall it's Wormtail from the Harry Potter movies. Which brings me to another interesting note, Gambon, Spall and Bonham Carter have all starred together in the Harry Potter movies.

Incredible,"I can't really think of enough or superlative enough adjectives to describe ""The King's Speech."" Colin Firth plays Prince Albert, second in line to the throne of England. He has a terrible stammer and finds public speaking painful. His wife, the Duchess of York (Helena Bonham Carter) endeavors to help him. She finally finds a speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who has been highly recommended. It's a difficult process for Albert; Logue wants to get at the psychological cause of the stammer, and the wooden Albert is interested only in the mechanics of speaking correctly. The relationship is volatile and on again/off again. Then King George V (Michael Gambon) dies, Albert's brother, Edward (Guy Pearce), abdicates, and Albert becomes King George VI.The wonderful screenplay by David Seidler has taken some dramatic license. The events in the film were moved up to the time just before Edward abdicates, making the important speech of King George VI at the beginning of World War II. In reality, these events happened in 1927, when Prince Albert made a speech in Australia. Logue, as the film indicates, worked with the King throughout the '30 and '40s.The change doesn't matter at all. The film is poignant, with some great touches of humor and fantastic performances, and the dramatic license makes Albert's plight all the more desperate.Colin Firth is magnificent as Albert/King George VI. A quiet man who adores his family, one can see the pain in his eyes and feel his anguish when he has to speak to anyone outside of his family. When Logue finally gets Albert to talk about the underlying reasons for his stammer, it's heartbreaking. Geoffrey Rush is sensational as Lionel Logue - witty, strict, and determined, he endeavors to treat Albert like any other student and break down his defenses. Helena Bonham Carter is lovely as the Duchess of York, portraying a lovely, gentle, caring woman who will do anything to help her husband and who suffers along with him. As George V, Michael Gambon is tough and scary, a hard man who challenges his second son because of the fears he holds about his first-born, the shallow Edward, being on the throne. There really aren't any off performances.The audience was with this film all the way and felt every moment. It's a fascinating time in the history of the royal family. If things had gone as planned - had Edward married someone acceptable and produced an heir, Albert and his family could have remained out of the limelight. King George V wanted desperately for Albert to be King and for ""Lilibet,"" Queen Elizabeth II, to succeed him. That wouldn't have happened, since Edward outlived Albert by 20 years; in that scenario of Edward, heirless and King, Elizabeth would have become Queen 20 years later than she did.King George V was right - Edward was too weak and distracted to perform his duties as King of England. The right man - and the right line of the family - wound up with the job.

Delightfully Decent,"German forces are mobilizing against Poland, England is about to declare war, WW II is imminent and a man with a mere ceremonial position, who makes no decisions as to the fate of the nation or the world, feels as though he is in a dire place since he has to read a three page speech on the radio. Despite a movie about a leader during this time and place the movie focuses on a rather light and bland premise that actually comes out as novel and a little interesting. The almost minor personal issue to be overcome compared to the grandiosity of whats going on in the world effectively humanizes modern royalty.Charming to witness the reluctant and later warmly developed friendship between royalty and a commoner where easy crowd pleasing moments come naturally and predictably (such as the shock and awe and merry excitement of having royalty come to the commoner's doorsteps asking for help) This personal nearly debilitating difficulty of someone with seemingly the best ""job"" in the world, becomes a nightmarish scenario. Some of us may have, others may not understand such a fear but the movie accomplishes the humanization of the Monarch making him relatable to the everyman.Colin Firth was a good choice sustaining his customary stiff, uncomfortable manner throughout the movie. He did a good job mingling his well expressed uptightness with a stutter.It is not the most interesting movie about the Monarchy as the movie ""The Queen"" comes closer to being, yet it was still a poignant crowd pleaser of a friendship between the King and his Speech Therapist.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"Expert Filmmaking, Firth's Powerful Performance, Make You Care","""The King's Speech"" utterly surprised me with how much it made me care, right from the start, straight through to the end. I was on the verge of tears a few times. I did not expect to have this reaction to a movie about a rich and privileged man's relatively minor troubles.I'm not an anglophile. I don't care about the British royal family. I don't suffer from a fear of speaking publicly. It would be easy for me to dismiss the problems presented in this movie as ridiculous, trivial nonsense: the king of England has trouble speaking? Who cares? He's one of the richest, most powerful men in the world. A speech impediment is a minor problem.The power of the film itself, and Colin Firth's heartrending performance, made me care deeply, from the beginning of the film to the end. That's the power of excellent filmmaking. A great film takes a struggle and a person you think you might not care about, and makes both seem as intimate to you as your own life.Colin Firth, in ""The King's Speech,"" gives one of the best performances I've ever seen. He outdoes himself. His role is very low key. He isn't an action figure. He doesn't do much of anything but slowly, and with dread, approach microphones, and attend speech therapy sessions, but he is overwhelmingly sympathetic, even when he behaves in an arrogant or snobbish fashion.Firth brings the message home: rich and powerful people are human, too, have heartaches and face challenges.Helena Bonham-Carter is crisp and cool as his wife. Her performance did not draw me in. Geoffrey Rush didn't grab me the way Firth did. Guy Pearce is excellent as King Edward VIII, but he is on screen all too briefly. Firth carries the film.The production values are first rate. Mansions, horses, period costumes: all sumptuous and convincing.There is key, brief newsreel footage of Adolph Hitler. Hitler was a mesmerizing speaker. King George needed to be able to speak once England went to war with Nazi Germany.I kept waiting for the film to tell us what caused the king's speech impediment, how other speech therapists of the day were treating it, and what Lionel Logue did differently. I never got definitive answers to any of those questions. Logue, it is said, achieved the results he achieved with his compassion, and I didn't see that in Rush's performance. His studio struck me as a large, cold, dirty, empty, uninviting room, and Rush's Logue often seemed more irritating in his boundary violations and sarcasm than compassionate.One serious flaw in the film – its Christophobia. In a cartoonish performance, Derek Jacobi, with very bad hair, portrays Archbishop Cosmo Lang as an evil snake. Read about Lang: he's not the caricatured villain this film foolishly makes him out to be.Complaints are minor. This is a terrific film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"A wonderful movie - Educational, inspirational and a Must See","I believe this is the only movie I have given a ""10"" to - perhaps one other. There are so many levels and angles one could use to describe this movie.One could take pity on a man for whom most of the world would believe had it ""comfortable"" - particularly in the background of the Great Depression - but one learns early that ""Mr. Johnson"" had his own deep problems and unlike most of us had to alternative but to face them head on.When I saw his 2 young daughters history suddenly came alive for me, realizing that they were Elizabeth and Margaret.There is some dry British humor when the speech therapist asks ""Mrs. Johnson"" if her husband can avoid speaking engagements.History comes alive in this movie that is entertaining, educational and inspirational.I left the theater believing George VI was a man who had a terrible handicap to overcome and through humility and guts, did so while leading Britain through her most terrible period.This is easily the best movie I have seen in some years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
One of the Best Films of 2010 & Certainly the One with the Best Cast.,"Winner of 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Tom Hooper's The King's Speech may not seem quite worthy of its prestigious honour on looking back today but its admirable visual flair, gorgeous set pieces, superb direction & magnificent performances do manage to lift it over the above-average level even if its story feels inadequately paced & not very compelling.A British historical drama set from 1925 to 1939, The King's Speech tells the story of King George VI who, in order to cope with his stammer, enlists the help of a speech therapist and the film as a whole is his journey from his struggle with stutter to becoming the United Kingdom's voice during the outbreak of Second World War while also covering his friendship with his therapist.Directed by Tom Hooper, the subject matter is transitioned on the screen in meticulous detail with extensive attention given to its visual presentation to provide an authentic look to the whole premise. Also complimenting it is Alexandre Desplat's impressive score but the strongest aspects of this film are its high-quality performances, especially from Colin Firth & Geoffrey Rush.Colin Firth chips in with a career best work & is immensely convincing in the role of King George VI. Geoffrey Rush delivers a calm but firmly controlled performance as the speech therapist, and the scenes between the two are the film's real highlights. Helena Bonham Carter is almost always amazing no matter what role she plays & even Guy Pearce surprises here with a commendable performance.On an overall scale, The King's Speech is a mixed bag that critics found way too much to praise about back when it was released & although it's possibly one of the best films of its year, it certainly isn't the best. The film is at its finest when it's trying to portray the fear & frustration of King George VI with his speech disorder but as a monarch drama, it remains an underwhelming experience for the most part. Worth a shot, nonetheless.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Single Shilling Bargain,"Greetings again from the darkness. British royalty is such easy pickings for film. The pomp and circumstance, colorful characters and dress, excessive everything, and especially the scandals provide an endless supply of material that can be twisted every which way. Director Tom Hooper who was responsible for fine work in the recent John Adams mini-series, takes the story of Prince Albert in a much different direction than one might think by reading history books.Collin Firth does a masterful job of portraying Prince Albert, who falls directly into the role of King after the death of his father George V (Michael Gambon) and abdication of the throne by his brother Edward (Guy Pearce) when he, for some reason, just has to marry the love of his life - a thrice divorced woman named Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). Now from a perspective of scandal, Edward and Wallis aka Duke and Duchess of Windsor, would make a far more juicy movie. Heck, even the story of pending World War with Hitler's Germany would have, and often has, made for a more juicy movie. But Mr. Hooper has chosen to deliver a human drama filled with frailty, doubt, tenacity and hope. Turns out, this was a very wise choice.Prince Albert ascends the throne as King George VI, husband to Elizabeth, whom we knew as the Queen Mother until her death in 2002. The two were the parents of a daughter, who became Queen Elizabeth, the current Queen of England. Yes, we American do struggle with our Royalty and all the re-naming, yet remain fascinated by it. However, it's important to note that this was a much different time. The film leads up to King George's infamous 1939 speech in which he calmly and steadily explained to many nations that England was declaring war on Hitler's Germany.What many do not know is that George suffered a severe speech impediment that caused him to stammer excessively under pressure. As you might imagine, this is a horrible affliction for a war time King! The guts of this story is the relationship between King George and his peculiar speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). There are so many dynamics in their relationship that each scene is like a skirmish between the two. Truly a fascinating progression to behold.A deep friendship based on respect and trust develops and remains through the rest of their lives. More importantly for Britain and the world, Logue guided the King to a strong performance in the most crucial speech ... thereby bringing strength to a nation and commitment from allies. Not sure which of these men was the better leader, but together they were proved very strong.Firth, Rush, and Bonham-Carter are all excellent in their roles, and I also got a big kick out of Timothy Spall as a young Winston Churchill. Mr. Hooper does a remarkable job of creating a very human drama out of a historical period and event. The death march to the microphone is just excruciating in the climatic scene. We can feel the pain of the onlookers and supporters as the will their King to perform. I can only guess that the Queen Mother was instrumental in the development of Rolaids after so many trying moments!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
British love in that is not as good as the hype.,"Stammering, and other speech impediments are terrible afflictions that rarely elicit sympathy. When can you last recall a movie or TV programme with a sympathetic stammerer or lisp? Bet you can recall the opposite! How about Life of Brian? ""Wewease the cwiminals"" And yet our world is full of stutterers, stammerers and lispers; some of whom have overcome their problems like Bruce Willis, Tiger Woods, Julia Roberts, James Stewart; the list is endless.Nevertheless the subject has never made it to the big screen in a serious and sympathetic form, until now.The King's Speech is fundamentally a British feelgood movie about stammering. It uses King George the 6th (Actually named Albert and Father of Queen Elizabeth) as the subject and sets the story against the background of a brewing and erupting Second World War.Great Britain is facing dark days (reflected perhaps in the cinematography which is most certainly dark), King George the Fifth is on the throne but is falling into senility and his eldest son David (soon to briefly reign as King Edward the 8th) is in the midst of a scandalous affair with, gosh, An American, in the form of double divorcée Wallace Simpson. The Head of the Church of England is a role of the British monarch and that role does not allow the incumbent to marry a divorcée. But David (Edward) wants to marry Wallace more than he wants to rule Brittania. And so he abdicates leaving poor old stammering Prince Albert next in line.Albert (played to Oscar contending levels of sustained excellence by Colin Firth) has been tackling his demons for years but has had absolutely no success and is fast becoming a recluse, albeit married to our dearly beloved Queen Mother (played with a twinkle by the ever dependable Helena Bonham Carter - surely a national treasure in the mould of Dame Judie Dench in the making). He's pretty much given up hope , but Queen Mum hasn't and she finds and engages the services of a Harley St quack played to perfection by Geoffery Rush.What follows is a story about the development of a relationship and the triumph of wills married to unorthodox practices. It opens the doors to humour, pathos and a degree of tension. How could our stammering Prince become a king fit enough to stand shoulder to shoulder with Churchill as Britain takes on the Gerries? On some levels the film woks. It feels nicely in period. The acting is universally excellent (Derek Jacobi has a nice cameo as the Archbishop of Westminster) and the story is engaging enough. The ending, which I shall not spoil for you here, although it is fairly obvious is by far the highlight of the movie and very moving indeed.And yet...and yet. It drags. It feels slight. It has no real message other than, perhaps, the Royalty are humans too. My feeling is that this movie is a bit of a ""the British are coming"" industry love in. It's actually not that great. A good (BBC) TV drama sure, but for all the hype it falls short.Good but missable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Stop Stuttering and Stammering! Pontificate, Articulate, Theorize, Specify, and also, Implement Leadership with your Nation During World War II","It isn't often that you see a film which gratifies the movie viewer's penchant for intellectual humanism, ""The King's Speech"" is, indeed, such a movie. The cerebral intuition to the production; ""The King's Speech"", represents an esoteric saturation to the discerning movie critics, as well as intelligent movie goers. Such a technique instantaneously separates this motion picture from the general run of the mill flick! Colin Firth plays King George VI, he is extraordinarily talented! His tremendous repertoire as an actor includes his compelling performance in ""English Patient"". The movie, ""English Patient"", won the academy award for best picture in 1996. Colin Firth's performance in this film ""The King's Speech"" is totally outstanding! King George VI had an enormous problem with stuttering, hence, he had trouble orating effectively, and, as a result, King George VI severely struggled with the monotonous repercussions of an egregiously inarticulate speech. An individual's speech is a rudimentary manifestation of his feelings, his attitudes, his fervor and philosophies. The inability to speak properly brings on an intellectual impotence for a person to formidably battle with. The professional liability of a stammered speech rudely afflicts an individual with a coerced taciturnity. The success and failure of a human being is largely predicated on how this individual composes his overall verbal demeanor. This resonating impression which a person has created, ultimately gets judged by the fluidity of his speech. For a generic person of this world to be hindered with a stammering speech is an insurmountable dilemma, but, for someone who is in the limelight of British sovereign hegemony, the problem of flawed speech is , to say the least, utterly catastrophic! How a person speaks becomes the dynamic by which they are evaluated. This statement pertains to all individuals worldwide, but, the crucial importance to eloquent speech is emphasized ten-fold amidst England's royalty! King George VI was amongst members of British nobility, this plight made his inhibited oratory skills something that left King George VI susceptible to scorn, as well as relegated to anonymity! Gregory Rush plays Lionel Logue, King George VI 's speech therapist. King George VI was very reticent to capitulate to speech therapy because of a societal exasperation which he was burdened by. The tenacity to overcome stuttering became a lethal struggle for George VI to fully comprehend. Irascible, agitated and just simply angst ridden, George VI almost categorized the whole speech therapy rigmarole as aggregately pointless. Muddling through all of the covert aristocratic ridicule, by his cavorting plutocrats in London, became the more comfortable, yet heinous alternative. This pejorative complacency harbored a myriad of circumstantial scapegoats. Taking the high road would be to conquer the monster of adversity, something which King George VI ultimately chose to do. This movie is unbelievably powerful! The acting, the director (Tom Hooper), the cinematography, and, the adapted screenplay, are all remarkable! Based on the factual account whereby Europe was besieged by the decree of dictatorial terror from Adolf Hitler, King George VI had to rise above his speech crisis. His final decision to assert Great Britain's position against tyrannical Nazi, and Fascist rule was established with his vociferous edict to establish England's involvement in World War II. The itemized intricacies of triumph over physically impaired speech encumbrances were depicted with a stunningly succinct authenticity in this movie. King George VI and Lionel Logue stayed friends for the rest of their lives, as their kindred spirit was one which fell within the realm of dependence. The scenario of being dependent upon someone, and having someone dependent on you, became a comfortably platonic situation that cultivated a bond of candidly cogent affection for both King George VI and Lionel Logue to indelibly cherish. The movie ""The King's Speech"" won four Academy Awards: Best Actor- Colin Firth , Best Director- Tom Hooper, Best Screenplay, and, of course, ""The King's Speech"" won for Best Major Motion Picture for 2010!! All four of these awards are a reflection of how excellent this movie truly is! This website ranks ""The King's Speech"" the 109th best picture out of the top 250 ever made. The lofty dissertation that ""The King's Speech"" engages in, warrants this coveted accolade in which IMDb has made it the recipient of! The camera angles to this movie are spectacular, as they intensify the intransigent cerebral frustration that King George VI had to endure! The premise to this film, ""The King's Speech"" evokes an intellectual paradigm for movies which is essentially unprecedented in the Hollywood major motion picture industry!! Thorough rumination of the pertinent and germane concepts in ""The King's Speech"", were ideological aspects of historical reality that ascertained a brilliantly vivid mindset to the film audience. This enabled movie viewers to format a bevy of prolific and intellectual perspectives that this motion picture purveys! See this film, without fail, it is a FLAWLESSLY PERFECT TEN!! MOST ASSUREDLY!

Words don't come easy,"The King's Speech was a low budget British film that became a box office behemoth and won the Best Picture Oscar.It is a tale of Bertie, the younger son of the monarch who tries to overcome his stammer which might be rooted on his upbringing in a severe household. When his older brother abdicated from the throne, Bertie is elevated as King George VI and needs to speak to his subjects as war with Germany is approaching.The King's Speech is almost a theatrical tale opened up for the cinema. Despite director Tom Hooper using green screen for some exterior shots, making creative use of art & set direction, this is a small scale film with big stars who give big performances ranging from Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter and Guy Pearce.Ultimately the film concentrates on the developing friendship between two men, Bertie and his unconventional speech therapist Lionel Logue, who looks at the psychological basis as to why Bertie had the stammer in the first place.However I did find the film a little too sedate, stuffy and not all that interesting. The comedy sometimes felt forced as Logue uses foul language to make Bertie lose his stammer.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Personifies Brilliance,"The Kings speech is an excellent example of a movie that infuses warmth and beauty with your blood. You let out a smile just a little while after the movie begins to execute its screenplay and this smile persists all the way till the very end. It is one of those movies that vaporize any form of anger or sadness a person possesses. The scenes are very deep. It isn't an exhilarating screenplay or a harsh-bloody scene that makes its scenes deep, it's the dialogues. And these aren't dialogues that utter in a loud, symbolic voice, these are dialogues that come from the most subtle voices, but strike your heart as if you just heard a nuclear explosion. You get an Adrenaline rush the moment these dialogues are said. That's the power of words - that's the power of The Kings Speech. The dialogues are brilliance personified on one end, but what else is good, is the acting and the script. The acting deserves a million simultaneous clapping of hands. Colin Firth executes helplessness initially, with a rather oppressed character, while Geoffrey Rush plays his hypothetical snake-charmer who must set the snake in motion. He makes the oppressed rise from his snake-basket to the outside-world and face them and leave them starstruck. And all this is carried out beautifully. The story is simple, yet powerful, meaningful, deep and extremely well written. So The Kings Speech is basically a movie about shackles. The shackles that tie a person down and how that person must break free. For some people these shackles may be some of their personality traits while for some they are the society, family problems and what-not that subdue a person down and leave him stripped from his abilities and skills. It is also a tribute to the 60 million people who stammer, the men and women who have to face difficulty while doing the one of most important thing of ones life - conversing. He must fight with the flow of his words every day. It is a battle with oneself that must be faced every day of a persons life. These men deserve a tribute, a homage and the kings speech gives it to them. It is also mixes a decent amount of humor and attempts to showcase the importance of men who aren't of royal blood to those who are, and how they must be given equal treatment. It is a movie that glorifies 60 million people, it is a movie that extinguishes inequality between royal and normal blood, it is a movie that dignifies the power of words, it is a movie that expresses the importance of breaking free from life's shackles, It is a movie that personifies brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

The Best Movie of 2010,"I can't think of a more perfect movie than ""The King's Speech."" It got all the 12 Academy Award nominations that it deserves. I do predict that Colin Firth will win as King George, aka ""Bertie,"" the sixth, and Geoffrey Rush will win as Bertie's loyal speech therapist Lionel Logue, who helps him overcome his stutter and then becomes his friend for life. Helena Bonham Carter was fantastic and exquisite as Bertie's loving wife, the Queen Mother Elizabeth, who recommends her husband to the speech therapist, and deservedly was nominated best supporting actress. I'm not sure if she will win, but I would nominate her. Best actress win? Natalie Portman, the front runner for ""Black Swan,"" an overrated ""artful"" horror movie that I will not see, and many people I know personally don't like that movie.What I liked most about ""The King's Speech"" is that it is not a pedantic fact-throwing history lesson taught by your average social studies teacher. It is really a very touching story that delves into Bertie's positive relationship with his wife, his daughters, and the speech therapist. When his older brother King Edward (Guy Pearce) decides its time to abdicate the throne, Bertie is the next of kin and has to step in. But he is not all that confident enough due to his stammer, so the Queen Mother and the speech therapist help out. When Bertie is angry, he doesn't stammer. It comes out more so when he is nervous. During the speech courses, many lessons are learned, and some are quite humorous as you will see.Then comes the big speech at the end of the movie. It's 1939, and Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain got England into World War II against Hitler and Nazi Germany. When you hear Bertie speak through a microphone, your heart, mind, and soul will feel warm all over.""The King's Speech"" passes the litmus test for positivity in every way. You don't have to be a history scholar to understand the movie. Let the history be the backdrop and concentrate more on the relationships and the wonderful feelings the movie wants to convey.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
a great movie,"I'm a fan of movies about real people & events, & I think I would have accidentally overlooked ""The King's Speech"" if my parents hadn't mentioned reading a review in the local paper, where a critic had given it an ""A-minus."" That was good enough for me, so I saw it today in a crowded theater and was not disappointed. ""The King's Speech"" is definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year (and I go to about 30-40 movies a year).I read about King George VI's speech problems but that's not what the movie is about. It's about facing your fears, especially in your darkest hours--and it's okay if you need (and seek) a little help. Prince Albert (Firth) was put into a difficult situation; he was a happily married family man/naval officer and totally unprepared for the role that fell to him in December 1936 when his brother, Edward VIII, abdicates the throne to marry a twice-divorced American woman. Albert had been taking speech therapy from Lionel Logue (Rush) for a while before becoming king & after he was crowned, Britian got involved in WWII and King George VI had to make lots of speeches (via radio) to bolster his subjects. Logue was with him all the way, yet no one ever knew.Great performances all around by Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth, and Helena Bonham-Carter. Guy Pearce (one of my favorite actors) played Edward VIII (he didn't look as wimpy as Edward but he definitely appeared as flaky) and I wonder how many young people know (if they see this movie) that the oldest of the king's 2 daughters is now Queen Elizabeth II? Anyway, don't take my word for it. See ""The King's Speech"" and decide for yourself!",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The King's Speech: it doesn't speak for me,"Apart from causing some debate over historical accuracy, The King's Speech has been almost unanimously praised. Its stars, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, received BAFTAs for their performances and the film has been nominated for 12 Academy Awards. So, seeking to escape the heatwave here in Australia a couple of weeks back, I finally went to see what all the fuss was about.With one exception – its self-conscious swearing – this is a film so traditional in both aesthetic form and apparent values that it could have been made at the time of the events portrayed. Except that if it were from the 1930s (unless merely a rank propaganda exercise), The King's Speech might have offered a complex insight into real history. It might have marshalled the strict rules of classical Hollywood narrative filmmaking that were then at peak development to deliver, not only taut and fast-moving cinema, but perhaps also a thematically interesting and not entirely predictable work. Instead, as it is, the film moves with leaden-footed obviousness to an inevitable conclusion, the narrative offering no surprises within and between scenes, and tells its story through consistently bland images.Tom Hooper, the TV-based director of The King's Speech, has clearly tried to make a 'quality film' here by ticking all the boxes designed to please a sizable adult audience that understandably dislikes contemporary Hollywood movies aimed at teenage boys. The film is peppered with some English-weather-derived atmospheric exterior shots familiar from countless BBC period dramas. The interior scenes are dominated by shots that strive for classical lightness and transparency but are, in fact, rather arbitrary-looking and quite artless.This clumsy TV version of a would-be 'quality Hollywood'-style movie becomes momentarily unhinged when what some pernickety film scholars call the '180-degree line' is broken during a conversation scene, so that a cut to a new shot seems to show one character suddenly looking in the opposite direction despite not having moved. If it popped up much earlier in the film, this moment might have promised something more than a poor, wheezy version of outmoded film language. But it was merely a mistake.For its many admirers, the film's character-based drama makes The King's Speech clearly superior to blow-'em-up Hollywood cinema, especially as given life by two 'virtuoso' performances. But beyond surface theatrics, what kind of world do these vividly portrayed figures perform for us?As the Prince Albert, Duke of York, or 'Bertie' to his family, Colin Firth's familiar on-screen persona reaches an almost ridiculous apotheosis of privileged, repressed English masculinity. Here he gives us its absolute zenith as the humiliated, chronically stammering unelected hereditary heir and then leader - as King George VI - of the world's most powerful country, a huge number of whose domestic and colonial subjects (25 per cent of the Earth's population, as a radio announcer proudly reminds us in an early scene) suffer lives of shameful poverty and exploitation. This, remember, is Britain before Labour's extensive postwar welfare and social reforms (following the June 1945 landslide election defeat of Winston Churchill's Conservative Party). This is the country whose nineteenth-century slums and working conditions were the prime source material for Marx and Engels' famous works.But potential subversion is gradually enough drowned in the sentimental goo of an unequal love story, with feisty egalitarianism kept safely in check as therapeutic method. So the offence Lionel causes prior to George VI's coronation by lounging on his throne, saying 'I don't care how many Royal arseholes have sat here', is engineered to try and generate some proprietorial hubris befitting a hereditary ruler – not exactly the act of a colonial ratbag.Lionel, the King's 'friend' by the end, finally utters the distinctly impersonal 'Your Majesty' with satisfied you've-earned-it approval following his coaching of the new monarch to inevitable triumph: not only delivering a stammer-free, gravitas-laden radio speech to the nation and its colonies, but also giving the royal imprimatur to Britain's declaration of war on Germany. In this seemingly odd-couple romance, the character who at first seems to be a more modern figure who is disrespectful of stuffy tradition and quintessential hierarchy ends up reaffirming such values by instilling faith in the crown's 'natural' wearer.While US and UK critics and audiences have their own problematic reasons for extolling the film, Australians have exhibited pride that it has a prominent local presence both on and off screen. But even more perhaps that it is our man – resplendent with his moderate middle-class Australian accent (via notably theatrical diction) – who stands up, initially at least, to the quintessence of undemocratic English power and privilege that we think we love to knock.However, far from being discredited or disavowed, through being 'made human' the symbolic ruler of such a world is updated for the then-new mass media age and for our own current self-help era. Showing us that 'royals have problems, too', the Australian in The King's Speech effectively cures – indeed redeems – the sclerotic privileges and personage of colonial-era British monarchy.With the literal and figurative restoring of the King's speech, egalitarian and potentially more radical words and visions are silenced. The film thereby also reinforces the clichés of stuffy old England and brash young Australia – as affectionate, mutually reliant partners joined in an embrace that effectively rejuvenates the former's traditional pomp and power thanks to the latter's fresh coat of reassuring paint.The King's Speech, then, is the ultimate, conservative, middlebrow, made-to-order Oscar contender.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

My Fair Monarch,"It's so hard when you're seeing a movie after it's been hyped as much as ""The King's Speech"" has and been nominated for 12 Academy Awards to boot not to have expectations of greatness....and be somewhat disappointed when greatness fails to materialize.That said, ""The King's Speech"" is a perfectly well-made and mostly entertaining film about King George VI and his efforts to overcome a stutter that threatened to hurt his image as ruler of his kingdom. The speech of the title is the one George delivered to the British people declaring war on Germany at the outbreak of WWII. The delivery of that speech is the film's best moment; the rest of the movie is tasteful and intelligent, but not overly inspired.I could have done without the ""Ordinary People"" therapy moments between George and his speech therapist (played in the film's best performance by Geoffrey Rush), in which we learn that George's problem results from a troubled childhood and the pressures placed upon him by dear old poppa. Those scenes are redundant anyway, because one scene between George and his dad (played with brief gusto by Michael Gambon) tells us all we need to know. However, I did like what the movie had to say about the emergence of radio and how it redefined public relations. After radio came along, it was no longer enough for leaders to simply be seen by their public; they had to be heard too, and they better be sure when they were heard that they sounded like leaders. At the time I saw this, I was reading David Halberstam's ""The Fifties,"" which talks at length about the very same kind of transition between radio and television in the late 1940s, so I found that part of the film especially of interest.Colin Firth is quite good as George, and Helena Bonham Carter doesn't get much to do (but does what she does get to do well enough) as the Queen Mum.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Not only a stammer!,"The King's Speech a drama surrounding the stammer Duke of York and his therapist is getting a lot of award attention lately. You cannot argue about the fact that this is a good piece of filmmaking, but it lacks some essentials in the entertainment sector, which is a bit of a downer coming out of the theater.For a historical drama it is always a fine line to walk between the repetition of historic facts and the refreshment with new creative parts. Sad thing about The King's Speech is, that it walks this line well from a script perspective, but it is rather unentertaining when it comes down to the historic facts. Every scene that is outside the room of Lionel Logue is a bit of a letdown, because you get the feeling that it is only there to provide a bit of additional drama. It sure tells the historic background a bit and the urgency of a strong and stammer-free King, but it feels short sometimes. The entertainment in this movie is provided by the great chemistry of Firth and Rush. Their scenes, that they have together are strong in the dramatic department and they are giving this film the award spark. Firth, as the stammer Duke of York, who later becomes George VI, the King of the Kingdom of Britain, and Rush, as his therapist are doing a great job of playing their characters in an entertaining and interesting way. The thing between this two is, that the power is reversed, which makes for an interesting look at a Prince, that is working out of his comfort-zone. Logue as an authority works with the King with very unconventional methods. The King can argue about the way these methods are working, or about the way his therapist is treating him, but he cant argue with the results.This look at a odd couple is great, not only because of the therapy but also because of the character development. George is opening himself to his therapist and those stories are really a strong dramatic act in the film. Colin Firth is getting a lot of attention because of his performance, but it might be for the wrong motives. He surely delivers a great acting performance with his stammer, the way his face is doing the stammer, how he keeps it up and only slightly improves his speech throughout the film, when his therapist is not available. That is a great performance, but he also delivers a human Highness, he is able to walk the thin line between a Royal Highness, that should demand respect out of every person, and a human being that really needs the help of a therapist. Logue as the counterpart is a demanding and authority driven person, who is the only ""doctor"" around, who can treat the King because of the lack of respect for his social position. That is a social image that is hard to deliver, but those two are working as a cohesive unit that brings across this fact perfectly.At the end of the movie, where the therapist has to leave his safe castle, to really help his patient out of the house in the real world, the relationship between those two is great and as an audience you really get the equal level of these two. The only thing that makes underlines the social difference between the two right there is the great camera work. The speech George delivers, The King's speech, is done in a small room, and Logue and George are treated as equals, only the fact that the camera is looking upwards to George and down to Logue manifests the difference between the two at the end. With these small things Tom Hooper was able to get the equal relationship that should exist between a therapist and his patient, but still showing the different social levels.Other than that The King's Speech is a good film, that deserves the award spotlight, but is not entertaining all the way through. What still remains is a great performance by Firth, Rush and also Helena Bonham Carter, she plays the ""first lady"" the proper attitude and also is performing the equal relationship at the end of the movie. It's a well- rounded cast with a good story and great performances, that are elevating this movie to a hot candidate for any award!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The King CAN speak,"When my 5 year old son asked me what the film I was about to see was about I told him there was a King who needed help to speak and that a man, who would become his special friend, would help to teach him. When I returned home - blown away from what I had seen - my son asked me, ""did the man help the King to speak Mummy?"" Still sniffing from the resonating emotion of watching a powerful account of an unusual friendship I nodded and told my son that the King could now speak.I first recall seeing Colin Firth in Tumbledown (1988), a British drama about the Falklands war. As a teenager, I was fascinated by wartime movies and a film about the relatively recent (1982) Falklands conflict completely captivated me, as did Firth's performance.Twenty one years later, he commanded my attention again with his performance in A Single Man (2009) and now, 2 years on, I found his role as King George VI outstanding.An actor who has become synonymous with Jane Austin sagas, and who I am sure is widely regarded as an archetypal Gentleman - an example of middle-class Britishness - fits effortlessly into this role as a British Monarch.What is truly magical about this performance is his abandonment of the Standard English we all associate him with as he acts against his inclination to talk 'well-to-do'. And the gusto with which he attempts this deserves an Oscar in itself.Of course, his stammer still leaves the residue of an accent we would expect of a Royal but his feigned mispronunciation of words highlights the inherent talent of a captivating performer.Within 10 minutes of it starting, the film's mise-en-scene, cinematography and plot tension gave me goose bumps. It was heart-wrenching to realise at the film's end that I was sharing the cinema with a predominantly elderly audience, who would have been the most moved by the final reel of images.British-born Director, Tom Hooper, captured the essence of Post-Victorian England with finesse, and offered a nostalgic and insightful perspective on the renegade, Mrs Simpson; conjuring up memories of history classes I had had as a child growing up in England.The King's Speech is about the power of faith, in oneself and others, juxtaposed against civic duty.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
An outstanding reconstruction of how a small man made a great king,"This masterfully crafted and splendidly acted slice of history, reminds a nation ever more forgetful about its Royal Past, how the 2nd son of Prince George V - after being forced to ascend the throne when his brother abdicates to marry a recently-divorced commoner - had to overcome a terrible speech impediment to unite his people against its common enemy at the outbreak of World War II, and in doing so became one of the great symbols of faith and hope during the war. All the secondary roles are impeccably cast, although Timothy Spall's obvious imitation of Winston Churchill does tend to distract you from the real story. But this is Colin Firth's movie all the way, and he gives an unforgettably sensitive, dignified and utterly believable portrayal of a man who has to over come great demons from past and present and comes to realize that he can only do that with the help of the man who was to become his greatest friend: Lionel Logue, played with great wit and an unusual restraint by Geoffrey Rush, who also shines in this fascinating drama. His chemistry with Firth makes Firth shine even more, and that is the sign of a truly great piece of acting. It helps if you know the historic importance of George IV's speeches, but this film will move you with or without that knowledge.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
AMAAAAAAAAAZING!!!  Absolutely Amazing!!!!!,"I had seen no previews to this movie, and I had read no reviews. The only exposure I had was the ad for it on this website, and I knew I had to see it. I was fully expecting to be 'satisfied' with 'a good flick', but what I was not anticipating was to be swept away by an utterly amazing work of art. I cannot recall a single character or even bit-part in this film that was not played with such refinement and skill. When an actor(s)can make you forget that you're even watching a movie, yet make you feel like you're watching real life taking place, you know they have really worked their magic.I've seen very few of Colin Firth's movies, but what I have seen I was very impressed with. Helena Carter can play such wide a variety of characters, and is truly a skilled actress that seems to know how to nail each role, whether she's playing the Queen of Hearts in Alice In Wonderland; a mentally unstable woman in Fight Club or Sweeney Todd; or her more refined roles in Room With A View and The Kings Speech. Then there is Mr. Rush, who is always a pleasure to watch, and really made me understand the tremendous power a supporting actor can have in a film.I missed this when it first came out in theaters because I had no knowledge of it at that time, so I was so pleased to have been able to view this during the re-release before Oscar time. I've not seen the other movies that are up for Oscars, but I am positive that this is going to be the movie of the year, and justly so.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The king who didn't fall off his horse conquers his stuttering in a film that humanizes the Royals,"THE KING'S SPEECH may not be a truly great film but it comes close. The acting is splendid, the costumes well-researched, the background score including some classic pieces of Mozart and Beethoven is inspiring, and Tom Hooper's direction is admirable.What hampers the film is the fact that it's protagonist, a stuttering man (Colin Firth) who must ascend the throne when his brother (Guy Pearce) abdicates, is really quite a dull man with a fierce temper and an inability to express himself as a person until he meets the challenge of a speech therapist. But for all his courage in overcoming his handicap, he keeps the story from moving forward until the last thirty minutes when the story's stature becomes more important because of the impending threat from Hitler and WWII.However, it must be said that Colin Firth plays King George VI with gusto, matched only by Geoffrey Rush as Mr. Logue, his therapist. The two of them create sparks in many a confrontational moment of truth, and each has a firm grip on their roles. Equally proficient, but less noticeable and given a smaller amount of screen time, is Helena Bonham Carter as the gracious and adoring woman who stands by her stubborn man and presides over a household of two children, one of whom is a future Queen of England. In a lesser but still rich role, Guy Pearce is excellent as Edward VIII.But unfortunately, because of the film's preoccupation with King George's speech impediment, the film moves forward at a snail's pace and only becomes more urgent during the final half hour when the world awaits the king's reaction to the news that Great Britain has failed to prevent war with Germany.All the technical merits make the film outstanding in various departments, particularly the cinematography, costumes, settings and music. Colin Firth deserved his Oscar and Geoffrey Rush would have deserved a nomination as a Best Actor rather than Best Supporting Actor since his role his clearly a co-starring one.More importantly, the film does a grand job of humanizing the Royals.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Because I have a right to be heard! I have a VOICE!!!,"A memorable tale which was beautifully potrayed by one of the finest overall performances - THE KING'S SPEECH.
Colin Firth was at his best depicting the life of one of the greatest historical figures and I've to say he has done a staggering job. He probably gave a performance which will be remembered for ages to come!!
Other great performances by Geoffrey Rush and Helena Carter aided to produce one of the finest re-tellings of one of the finest historical events.The movie was so beautifully directed and depicted , that you almost find yourself within the premise of the Royal England!!

Good movie,"As a former Canadian, I grew up in the British Empire and lived through WW II. I was mesmerized as a boy listening to King Edward's radio speech of abdication for ""...the woman I love"". In the film she appears as an evil seductress (close to the truth!). The actor playing Winston Chuchill appears grotesque. Everyone else is superb. The times were momentous and the high drama of the British Royal family served a useful purpose. The English people and the rest of the free world were rallied to oppose the Nazi hordes. Hitler soon ruled over all of Europe. England was next, and very nearly fell to a Nazi invasion. Now comes this movie based on a ridiculous notion, a drama about a speech therapist and his patient with an intractable stammer. Their eventual triumph as King George VI in his radio address rallies the free world brought the theater audience to a round of applause, well deserved.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Firth and Rush on top form,"As the credits rolled at the end of this movie when I saw it at a local cinema on New Years Eve last, a group of patrons broke out in spontaneous applause - something very rare these days - and I felt that I had been rewarded with a rare film-going experience. For me, this is by far the best film I have seen in a decade.It is worth seeing this film just to enjoy the scenes involving Colin Firth (as the King) and Geoffrey Rush (as Lionel Logue, the speech therapist.) Their time together on screen ripples with energy and tension. Their Academy Award nominations are well-deserved. Colin Firth is probably a shoe-in, as his portrayal of the stammering Bertie is nothing short of flawless. Rush and Bonham-Carter may have to be satisfied with just the nominations they each so richly earned.There is much depth of talent in the cast - Timothy Spall, Guy Pearce, Derek Jacobi, Jennifer Ehle, Michael Gambon, Claire Bloom - and it seemed liked so many actors of class and experience were willing to climb aboard.But the highest accolades must go to Director, Tom Hooper, and screenwriter, David Seidler. This film never strayed from the point. It is not really a biopic, and it is not really historical. It is a story about one man's personal struggle, and the people who helped him overcome his obstacles. The fact that this man was the King Of England at a time when leadership was required just complicated his personal difficulties. I found it to be a very moving experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
No need to fear,"I went into this with some trepidation that my high hopes would be dashed by a long drawn out plod through the trials and tribulations of ""bertie"". however, i have been left astounded by this film. its tone, and pace were perfect as was the use of humour. it is not often the audience reacts as one but i felt that every single person was living every moment through every stammer. Colin firth was simply outstanding and his delivery was nothing short of sublime. the relationships between him and the queen and with Geoffrey rush were both touching and real without ever lingering too long to make them soft. the whole feel of the film is uplifting and there is a very real sense of personal achievement. if you have to see only one film this year, please make this film the one. you wont live to regret it, and i would wager you will see it a second time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The King speaks. Long live the King!,"Kings speech left me speechless... well not really because I wanted to tell everyone how great this movies is, but it did left me speechless as a cinematographic, visual masterpiece.I have to admit I had no background knowledge of King George VI life. I probably wouldn't even care much about it if I was seeing the same story as some black and white documentary on Discovery channel. Because it just wouldn't be able to carry over the story so nicely as it did here.Yes, the movie does last almost 2 hours but by the end of it you are actually wishing it was a series and that the next week there would be another episode...What really surprised me is that this movie had more comedic moments than many of those that label themselves as comedies! Some scenes were just dead funny - of course most of them were between Bertie (Firth) and Logue (Rush) which were able to transcend the plateau of human emotions so gracefully onto the screen.I always believed there is a difference between actors and stars and when one watches Kings Speech you can easily spot where that difference lays. So big kudos to all of the actors that made this movie and absolute moviegoers delight.And because of the all of the above, and the wonderful connection between all of the actors, the actual kings speech, the one that whole movie revolves around, becomes an experience in itself and not just a king addressing the Nation.

Predictable but moderately satisfying drama,"This film is pitched perfectly at the fogey set, who should lap up its ham acting, conservative tone, mild humour and emotional clichés. The dramatic arc of the film is understandably predictable given its historical context, but the characterization and dialogue are often slightly jarring and deter from the film's plausibility. Geoffrey Rush's performance is overplayed, and his emotional signposting annoyingly obvious. The casting of Derek Jacobi, who played one of history's most famous stammerers in I, Claudius, is a knowing in-joke, but only serves to underline Colin Firth's own flabby effort as King George VI. Best get in and see this one before the award season hype becomes unbearable and raises expectations beyond what such a small scale and ultimately forgettable film can deliver.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Superb acting and script-writing tour de force,"The courage and gallantry of King George VI is a documented fact of history. And another fact of history will, surely, become the fact that this film is one of the finest dramatizations of a momentous period in the history of the West. Words will not do justice to this movie. It is one of ten best I've ever seen --a monumental showcase of script writing and acting. The star studded cast delivers throughout the film --there's an award-winning scene every minute, in lines spoken by Firth, Rush, Jacobi, Carter and Gambon, among others. There is not a superfluous word in the script --every line advances the plot and adds to character description. The close-ups are terrific as the actors transmit every nuance of their feelings in a description-defying performance that nails all possibilities in every scene. You have to see it it to believe it. Absolutely amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Excellent but flawed,"There seems to be an ever-growing obsession with our monarchy these days. In the recent years of political blunder, the credit crunch, and the folly of Iraq and Afghanistan, people seem to be turning to our Royal Majesty and her ancestors for comfort, possibly harking back to the days when we were a super-powerful empire. Yet the press are never too far away from finding a way to criticise or unveil an unspoken truth. I've never known a subject that can be so simultaneously loved and despised in equal measure. The cinema-going audience remain eager however, with the recent releases of The Queen, The Young Victoria and now The King's Speech proving critical successes as well as audiences flocking to see them.Arriving just in time for awards season, The King's Speech has been heavily praised and awarded in equal measures. It depicts the struggle of Prince and Duke of York Albert (Colin Firth) to overcome his severe stammer. In an era where the radio was becoming a powerful method of communication between the monarchy and the general public, it is something of a worry to the Prince, who with his father's illness and his brother's dangerous love-affair with an American socialite, is looking at a possible long term as King. His dedicated wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) tries one last possible solution in unorthodox speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who methods prove trying for the short-tempered Albert. Soon enough, his father George V (Michael Gambon) passes away and his brother Edward (Guy Pearce) abdicates soon after taking the reign to be with the woman he wants to marry, and with the seemingly unavoidable conflict with Germany brewing, Albert must find a remedy to his affliction in order to speak to his people.What struck me almost instantly about the film was the unique visual style. Not unique to film in general but to a genre that usually loves to linger on pretty dresses rather than trying to conjure up emotions through clever camera-work. Cinematographer Danny Cohen seems to trap Albert in a tight box, shooting up close and watching Firth twitch every muscle in his face. It's a very effective method, and alongside Firth's excellent performance, you get a feel of Albert's inner struggle and the overbearing pressure that is quickly building up on top of him. It also looks somewhat bleak. For a film that spends most of it's time in beautiful palace settings, it looks somewhat brown and drained of colour. It's almost as if it wanted to capture an age that we see mainly through black-and-white footage and sepia photographs. Critic Martin Filler described it as being 'steeped in strong tea' and he's bang on. It captures a certain Britishness that so many films in the genre attempt but ultimately fail.It raked up the awards, taking the Best Picture and Best Director awards, as well as an Oscar for Firth and for the Screenplay. This did initially put me off, but I reset my attitude and hoped for an excellent film.. In a way, it is an excellent film, but hardly worthy of being labelled the best film of the year. The acting is excellent all around, the music, script and as mentioned, the cinematography are also outstanding. But there are niggling problems with the film that stuck with me and brought the film down. Minor historical inaccuracies aside, which always have to be accepted to a certain degree, I was puzzled with the insistence of including Winston Churchill's (Timothy Spall) character, who seems to be there for no other reason that for us to say 'oh look it's Churchill!'. The character just seems like a caricature and the scene which he is mainly involved in took place with someone else anyway. Also Edward's character has obviously been altered to make him more of a sneering villain, a man whose selfishness and disloyalty to his country has placed Albert in this avoidable situation.A very good film all-round, notable for Firth's excellent performance as well as his supporting players who are equally as good. In a year full of strong films, I just don't think this is quite up to the same level. But I don't work on the voting board at the Oscars, so what do I know, right?www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Royal with Cheese,"At first I got the impression that the movie would be stiff, glamorous and high above clouds. But just as a ""Royal with cheese"" the supporting role helps bring down the royal to earth on a touchable level.Making a movie about a king having problem speaking, what could there be to tell? Well apparently a lot, and when the end credits rolled we were left wanting more.The movie takes a glimpse in the protagonists most important time of his life, he is about to become king. I have earlier tried to keep away from royalty movies because it is always the same game of power. By showing an undermining characteristic in the supporting role, it makes the movie feel down to earth, and it gets progressively easier to watch compared to the beginning. Even smaller matters seem bigger on the inside.A movie like this is all about the dynamics between the two leads, take Whiplash as an example. The protagonist constantly gets undermined by the second lead, creating a powerful bond and propelling the story into building a dynamic. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend it.We get a bit of the same struggle and reward in the movie but it could probably have been better portrayed. We see that the second lead have thoughts about another life, why not show more of that idea, creating a bigger difference between the two of them.The ending is good. An ending, clear as glass showing the class different between our leads, spending 2hours showing his personal life and ending with his public one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A stunning disappointment,"Academy Award for Best Picture? You have got to be kidding. Take an interesting but threadbare story, pad it up with stereotypical Hollywood moments and phony sentimentality, add lavish period shots - and we got a winnah, ladies and gentlemen. The new King of England has a speech problem and an unlikely bloke from Australia helps him. That's it. Not a lot of twists and turns in this one are there? And, by the way, the whole thing is based on a misconception: that stammering is caused by fear and childhood trauma. We know now it is inherited and physiological in nature, which entirely guts the impact of the content. This might have made a good HISTORY DETECTIVES segment, contrasting the historical event with the modern view. The problem is, no one knows much about what really went on. So, if you want to make a movie, you have to make up 90% of what you're filming, including the actual nature of the relationships between the characters. And they all ""feel"" made up, with the exception of the little girls - and, for my money, those two also did the best acting in the film. Geoffrey Rush does his usual overly-precious performance, playing hard to the camera and not really working from character. When are people going to wake up to his cloying schtick? What about all those knowing looks between the King and his therapist? Is there some sort of homosexual overtone being implied? If not, what? There's a certain uneven goofiness to the portrayal of their interaction that is superficial, unsatisfying, and very amateur. The only thing holding this turkey up is the superb craftsmanship of the cinematography and physical production values.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"F..., F..., F..., Fantastic!","A film extremely well produced, sensitive and based on a true story, which around better. The King's Speech is a film full of beauty, either by its plot, characters, photography, setting, costumes, light and moving soundtrack, but mostly his performances, starring Colin Firth.Colin Firth did an amazing job to perfectly capture the feeling of being a stutterer, the difficulty that these people go to great trouble to express themselves through words, but not only that, he made the glossy paper of a King very convincing, showing all their limitations and the fear of dealing with such power - even so it became known as a person rather shy -, also showed the will to lead his people, the desire to boast his family, it all became clear and very well worked this beautiful performance, which, in my opinion, deservedly received the Oscar for best actor, beating DiCaprio in Inception.As i stated, the plot is based on real events, and is wonderful to see behind the scenes of the royal family, their problems, conflicts and customs, was immensely enriching follow the trajectory of a King who suffers from stuttering and still manages overcome its limitations thanks his desire to lead his people. And even with many twists and turns, accompanied and assisted by his faithful friend, Lionel.I honestly did not expect much of this film, even though it received the Oscar for best picture, but I admit that surprised me a lot and found it very good.

Now what do i say about the movie. . I can just keep on writing and writing on how great this movie is but its will not do any justice to its quality unless you watch it. Colin Firth gives one of the most memorable and commendable performances of all time that is on par with Tom hanks in Forrest Gump. Now i do not care whether this movie is historically accurate or not.Geoffrey Rush is incredibly good and i have to eat my words here.

A truly inspirational Oscar-winning film for anyone like me who stutters,"I bought the DVD & praise Colin Firth for collecting his Academy Award portraying King George VI. As a man w/ a speech impediment, I empathized with Firth's character & the king's assistant Lionel Logue, who had an unconventional yet effective method of speech therapy. Without naming names or even dates, it's a hell of a burden for any person who's a monarch or some sorta world leader to present themselves to the public. But do keep in mind the name & date to acknowledge in ""The King's Speech"" is King George VI, who during the mid-20th century, particularly when Great Britain would enter World War II, did less of the dirty work as the king of England than the UK's prime minister, Winston Churchill (although Neville Chamberlin, Churchill's predecessor, was in charge during the film's setting and as history dictates, was less helpful than Winston). I'm also reminded of the scene where the royal family witnesses on media a certain man in Germany who was more eloquent and won over the people (clearly Adolf), thus urging King George (or I think Albert before he's crowned) to be more presentable to the Britons and whoever would become the Allies in the Second World War. Incidentally I think it's good that there is a film about the man who was king during Churchill's time, assuming there's been enough books & films about that prime minister of Great Britain but not the king during his administration (not to mention enough media about King George IV's successor, the currently reigning Queen Elizabeth II, as portrayed in the TV show ""The Crown""). Anyway, Colin Firth & Geoffrey Rush worked wonders with their characters in a film that collected 4 Oscars on a dozen nominations, and again as someone with a stammer, this true story of a British king is very inspirational & uplifting.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"Easy to watch, but devoid of social commentary","Supposedly one of the best films of 2011, 'The King's Speech' is a sad reflection of our times if it is indeed unbettered in a year. It's not an awful film by any means: the story of a man (who happens to be the King) slowly learning to overcome his personal fears. But the basic story is utterly generic, and while there's some entertainment value from observing such a tale in an unlikely context (in this case, a royal one), the film contains only the faintest of social commentary; if you expect a serious examination of the abdication crisis, Edward VI's alleged Nazi sympathies, observations how a 20th century country can claim to be a democracy while led by an unelected king, or even a revisionist portrait of Wallis Simpson, you'll be disappointed; instead, this is very gentle drama about a monarchy which may be a little up itself but is unquestionably a good thing. As for historical precision, the notion that the King would come out of a radio broadcast to be greeted by a delegation of the prime minister, the Minister of the Admiralty (Churchill), and the Archbishop of Canterbury, is not so much inaccurate (forgiveable in a drama) but ludicrous and obvious at the same time. For some reason, this film struck a chord with many in the population in 2011; watch it (at the end of the year) for an insight into royal wedding fever, but don't expect any insight into the London riots.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

His portrayal of a good man who becomes a great King is as powerful as it is subtle. It touched me on a most personal level, as it will anyone who has had to do a difficult thing and do it well.A superlative cast, a pitch perfect script and restrained direction--but Mr. Firth's performance is the jewel in the crown. This is a movie and a performance that should not be missed. I will think of this experience for a long time and treasure my speech as never before.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Moving and Exhilarating,"Some of this year's film awards should be given to this film, without question. The balance of humour and seriousness in the script is near ideal, and the humanity of all the characters comes off the screen very clearly. Helena Bonham Carter in the role of the (young) Queen Elizabeth is priceless, giving a fully-dimensioned portrayal of the woman behind the crown. Colin Firth as King George VI (her husband) here gives the greatest performance of his career to date. The timing of his scenes with Geoffrey Rush is absolute perfection, with both actors conveying the humour and the heartbreak that are equally implicit in the situation. Memorable moments come at the very beginning and end equally, where the radio microphone becomes an important character in its own right, thanks to the inspired direction of Tom Hooper. All the minor parts are cast from strength as well, and even the little princesses (Margaret and Elizabeth, the current Queen) convey a wealth of information in their brief appearances. This film is like a carefully crafted stage play, where every movement, every gesture, every nuance of speech and silence, has a purpose and helps to carry the story behind the story. This film held me spellbound every moment, right from beginning to end, and it came as no surprise when many of the audience began to applaud at the conclusion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Very well done,It's a very well acted movie. Some scenes feel a bit long but overall paced well and plenty of interesting things happen along the way. It's not fast paced by any means but worth the watch for any fans of the actors or the crown.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Best Partner,"This is a story about a king who suffers from stuttering, George, and a man who makes an effort for getting rid of the king's worry, Lionel. George makes an address instead of his father in front of peoples; however, because of his stuttering, he cannot speak well and he lose his popularity from the listeners. Many doctors try to treat him, though, no one can do it. The king's wife asks a man who comes from a colony, Lionel, to see her husband. At first George does not accept him and is angry with him; however, gradually he acknowledges Lionel, and starts their friendship.While watching this film, I feel a trust and bond between George and Lionel. George is royal and Lionel is a person from a colony, therefore generally it is not usual that they become friends. The fact that they are on a good terms moved me and I also want such a buddy.In addition, what I consider as great is the scene that Kin George fails to speak in a front of a lot of people. Actually, there is no scene which shows he cannot speak well. However, before the cut we can see his situation, such as much sweat and shakes. I think it is a great way invisible information makes us image a visible picture.This film is so good that I want to watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Exceptional, loved the behind the scenes look into the royal drama","This was good and historical movie buffs and royalists will love it. A little dry (as you'd expect) but uplifting and Oscar worthy from Firth who will bring a tear to your eye. The problem with seeing a movie that's been all hyped up and received a ton of awards (including a best actor Oscar) is that you expect to be blown away and usually end up disappointed, as was the case for me here. It's a well done movie on all counts though, costumes, locations, set design etc. And yes Collin Firth is exceptional as ""Bertie"" the stuttering King George.I enjoyed how this started before he became King and therefore gave us a look into his bully of a father, the scandalous abdication of his brother and his impromptu and unwanted ascension to the throne just as England enters the 2nd world war. I actually found all the behind the scenes royal drama far more interesting than his speech lessons with Geoffrey Rush. I also adored Helena Bonham Carter in her role as the Queen mother. 8/30/14",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

The King's Speech (2010),"Directed by Tom Hooper. Starring Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Derek Jacobi, Timothy Spall, Michael Gambon, Jennifer Ehle, Eve Best. (R)With the advent of the radio, long gone are the days when the British Royal Family need only look the part--they also need to serve as the voice of the nation. This does not bode well for future King Edward VI (Firth), who has been afflicted with a considerable stammer since childhood; enter speech therapist Rush. Well-produced and acted historical drama works best when focusing on the relationship between the two men, the techniques and frustrations and slowly-developing friendship; less successful when parading familiar historical figures around the fringes (Churchill (Spall) seems present only because he is recognizable, not because of any truth to his role in these events) or glossing over politics, especially appeasement and the sympathies of certain high-ranking politicians and royals. Alexandre Desplat's slowly swelling score is well-integrated for the lions' share of the film, but becomes overbearing during the climactic speech, while director Hooper's all-too-obvious montage of inspired parties across the city and country nullifies the gravitas of the words. One of those perfectly serviceable motion pictures with substantial levels of decoration (four Oscars, including Best Picture and Director) best remembered in the years after for its unaccountable triumph over far weightier and more daring fare.71/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Dull and anti-climactic,"I'm a little rankled by the over-the-top praise for this minor Masterpice Theatre dud. I'm not coming from a historian- or speech therapist's point of view, just an avid moviegoer.One letdown for me was, well, a pretty big one - after all that speech therapy, the king didn't seem to be that much better off at the end of the film. He never really had a pervasive ""Porky Pig"" stutter; more like an off-and-on stammer and fear of public speaking (at least that's how it was portrayed in the film). It seemed liked Firth forgot to deliver his lines with the impediment, or else in real life it was not that serious.The scenes that delivered the ""R"" rating had Firth being instructed to shout 4-letter obscenities as some kind of remedial. These struck me as gratuitous and inauthentic. This is not a great film, all things considered.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

They are both first-class actors and this movie was a real credit to them. I want to see more of these movies! I can't wait for it to come out on DVD...

Reminds me why I go to the movies.,"I grew up with my Dad showing me old Jimmy Stewart and Cary Grant movies. I remember when movies relied on dialogue and acting and not special effects that end up showing us the same explosions over and over again. Now don't get me wrong I enjoy some of those movies because they can be fun. However watching if I had the choice I'd always choose a movie like this because it's filmmaking at it's best, a film that shows who's who among actors today.Now if your a history buff you might know the story behind this. It's about The Duke of York and his stutter which made it hard for him to give speeches. Seems simple enough doesn't it? But there is so much more to the plot that I won't get into since I don't want to ruin the plot for you. I'll just say if you know your history none of this will be much of a shock to you.Movies today forget some of the reasons we go to the movies, firstly let me say I love movies like Sin City and Kill Bill and even movies like Scream and Last House on the Left (1972 version). But when some of these movies think more graphic and more depraved is what we're looking for I think there starting to lose touch with the audience.Now back to ""The King's Speech"" the performances are what made this movie shine above others. Geoffrey Rush's role is pitch perfect and it's one of those times where you can't see anyone else in that part. Colin Firth proves that he's among the great actors in this role. Especially after his role in ""A Single Man"".Up to this point I haven't really talked about this movie but if your reading this just believe me it's worth it. I usually try to avoid discussing plot points since most people already have a good idea what the plot is.This is one of the best movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Great ensemble acting,"This is a typical brilliant British film, carried along by its dialog and a great cast. It's a period piece that puts you right into the 1930s. The interplay between Albert and Lionel - strained by the British awe of the Royal Family - leads to misunderstandings, false starts, all of which are overcome by Lionel's belief in Albert, and Albert's determination to ""see the thing through"".My only criticism is of Churchill's character. He gets the voice quite well, but someone in the makeup department surely hated Mr Spall. It's the worst Churchill I've ever seen. That's surprising, given that Churchill is such an iconic image in England.Other than that, this is a movie worth getting on DVD and watching again.

"""Timing isn't my strong suit""","'The King's Speech (2010)' has been getting a lot of attention this awards season, and not undeservedly; it's a fine drama. This true story is anchored around two characters characters, one a British monarch (Colin Firth), and the other a little-known Australian speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush) with unconventional methods. The chemistry between the two leads is terrific, with Lionel Logue amusingly bouncing his eccentricities off an often-flustered King George VI. (The audience in my theatre responded very well to the lighthearted cultural jabs at Australia's expense).I've usually considered Helena Bonham-Carter to play very cartoonish characters, obviously due to her collaborations with husband Tim Burton, but here she manages to be rather understated and even graceful. Guy Pearce is good in anything (and yet he never appears for long enough), and here he's excellent as King Edward VIII, a haughty womaniser whose proposed marriage to American socialite Wallis Simpsons caused a constitutional crisis.For all its merits, however, 'The King's Speech' feels like too little butter spread over too much bread. The series of therapy sessions between Albert (later George VI) and Lionel are certainly entertaining, and monarch's war-time speech, guided by Lionel as though he were conducting an orchestra, was stirring enough, but I didn't quite feel the momentousness that director Tom Hooper was trying to suggest. One exception takes place in Westminster Abbey when Lionel, lounging casually on the coronation throne, asks his patient, ""Why should I waste my time listening to you?"", to which Albert replies, clearly and firmly: ""Because I have a voice.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Beautiful,"With 12 Academy Award Nominations, it is no wonder I suppose that my expectations of this movie were high. The movie narrates of king George VI, father of United Kingdom's current Queen Elizabeth II, and mainly about how he overcame his stammering. We see the king in his long sessions with speech therapist Lionel Logue (a fantastic performance of Geoffrey Rush) and in his palace among his family, struggling with his shame and frustrations.Someone who had seen this movie before I did, said to me: ""It's a great movie. No one gets killed, no one falls in love, and yet it is a great movie."" And it is. If it were not for the marvelous directing and camera work, it is for Colin Firth. My goodness, what an amazing actor; the way in which he portrays George VI with all his sides (his ferociousness as well as his fragility) is frankly moving. If he indeed wins the Academy Award for Best Actor, I will be extremely happy. It seems Colin Firth has been underestimated a lot since the start of his career; he finally gets the recognition he deserves. Absolutely brilliant.En then we have of course Geoffrey Rush, whom I mentioned before, and who is funny as the unconventional but dedicated speech therapist. And there's Helena Bonham Carter, of whom I've never been a fan, but who also deserves praise for her performance.As for the film itself, it's certainly been directed by a still very young, but talented actor. The camera work is lovely, as well are the decors and the lightning.I could start talking about that I sometimes felt this movie was leaning too much on Colin Firth's performances and that the story line seemed a bit boring sometimes, but I won't; the many good points of the film surpass its few less good points.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Gary Oldman was fantastic.,"Gary Oldman was fantastic. Also what I did like about this film was pretty much mentioned by everyone else previously. The acting was quite strong with the Rush and Firth putting on convincing performances. You generally looked forward to when these two guys were in the same shot and seeing what they would have to say. However, I don't understand why people think Firth's role couldn't be played by anyone else. Sure he does do a good job but quite a few people make it out to be the role of a lifetime. He mostly has trouble with enunciation and his anger but I'm sure any seasoned actor could portray that quite well. On the other hand, there are many one liners that will surely amuse most people by both their wit and delivery. There are also quite a few good shots in this movie with one of my favourites being after Edward viciously insults Bertie. You then see a shaken a Bertie while his brother forgets about him and goes socialize. So this film sounds good so far? Well that's really all I can say about it. The film has fairly strong acting, writing, and a believable setting. However, there's much more to a perfect film than simply having those few characteristics down. The film's plot is okay and for the most part you're just simply waiting for the two leads to share the same shot. The plot doesn't feel that well thought out and comes across as clichéd at some parts (ie the reluctance of Bertie going to a therapist and him not believing it will work when it does, the typical joyful montage of Bertie doing exercises with the therapist, the part where they ""break up"" and eventually come back together in the end, etc.) Not sure if what I said previously counts as spoilers since it is pretty clichéd but I'll check spoilers off anyway. There are also not simply many good themes in this film. After you see this, you just feel uplifted that this guy overcame his stutter for a short period of time. I don't think it'll have the impact like the way say a movie like Taxi Driver does where you feel changed by it. As well as being left sitting where you are and thinking about what you just saw for a long period of time.This is all coming from a person who had a lisp and was insulted much in the same way Bertie was, as well as having difficulties with public speaking. Even though I understand the character's position quite well and the difficulties he went through, I still don't think this was that good of a movie. Oh well, I guess people will be calling me a ""troll"" now but we'll see how that holds up in a few years.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

The back story of a famous and historical speech.,"This film had been heaped with praise before I saw it. I dislike having high expectations of a movie, and I was sure it would not live up to the ""hype."" However, I came away from the viewing with my expectations happily exceeded. The story was human, historical and well-told. The acting by all, including Helena Bonham-Carter, was outstanding. Perhaps needless to say, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush both deserve Oscars. It was refreshing to be totally absorbed by a story and by the characters and their interactions instead of by violence, chase scenes and explosions. Despite the lack of ""action,"" the movie kept my attention with the suspense that built naturally from the evolution of the speech. The relationships between the characters, the King and Queen, and the King and his therapist/friend were also well-developed. Since so much has been said about the two main characters, I want to add that Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal conveyed a queen who was loving, no-nonsense, traditional, but with a sense of humor. She also managed to balance the status issue with a healthy dose of down-to-earth-ness. I highly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The King's Speech (2010)  Leaves Me Speechless,"The King's Speech (2010) starring Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter, directed by Tom Hooper is not just another Hollywood movie about the British monarchy.In a way, the new King's (King George VI) trouble with giving a speech is reflective of the public's inability to hear. The King's hesitancy in his speech could be seen as an artistic metaphor for the country of England to not see the need to ""speak up"" or join the fight against the German Nazis. It's the old idea that the people get the leadership they deserve.The audience winces as the King's makes a few bad attempts at a public speech.It's more than a look at history. It's an inside look at a world family-and the bravery of one man appointed King who desperately rises to the occasion, after conquering not an army attacking his country, but after conquering his own internal and external enemies- his upbringing, his seemingly volatile, but repressed nature, and a resulting serious speech impediment.The movie presents us viewers with an ""against the odds"" story of the father of the popular Queen Elizabeth now residing on the British throne. We know, again from the movies, (The Queen, 2008) of the current Queen's dignity in the face of outside circumstances of fate and choosing. With the impending marriage of Prince William, there is an anticipation of a transition in the British monarchy, a monarchy riddled with past achievements and disasters both.The King's Speech movie lets us experience the individual strength of a King whose suffering is almost too painfully portrayed on his face until the end of the movie. Colin Firth is convincing as a man tortured by his childhood,and yet, with the help of his speech therapist, played by Geoffrey Rush, becomes his own person, finds his own voice.It's a great escape to watch this beautifully filmed movie- an enjoyable and enticing way to look inside the royal palaces and imagine what really happened. The portrayals are fictional from a screenwriter's pen. But, the result is a movie worth seeing and hearing._____________________________________________________________________Written by Mary Ellen Graybill,BS- a Pennsylvania-based freelance writer who has produced over 200 published articles for magazines and newspapers including the Baltimore SUN (Maryland).

We need more of these films,"I'll start off by saying that The King's Speech is in absolutely no way a bad movie and we need more of these beautiful films. The writing is solid, the camera angles are simplistic yet unique, and both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush give very good performances. What irritated me most about the movie though was how I felt it had been manufactured simply to win Oscars. The movie was in many ways too generic. It had everything that the Academy absolutely loves: a historical setting, a variety of unique costumes, a (mostly) happy ending, and a lead character with a disability (in this case, a speech impediment), who struggles to achieve his goals but succeeds by the end. I just felt like I had seen this kind of movie before, and while it was well written and well acted, it still felt generic, and perhaps even mediocre.One other criticism it that the film is somewhat unaccessible to a younger audience, as many details about the pre-WW2 British monarchy are ""assumed knowledge,"" as far as the film- makers are concerned, which was a little annoying to a sixteen year old Australian who thinks the concept of a monarchy is more than a little bit dated and pointless. My last criticism is that while Colin Firth gives a very good performance, his character came across as a bit of a whiny little snobbish cry baby. Here's this king, a man born into England's wealthiest family, who has a great lifestyle and bundles of money, yet he cries like a little baby simply because he can't speak properly. I realize his speech impediment is vital to the core concept of the film, but Colin Firth's king ultimately felt very unlikable to me, as the character simply isn't charming, likable, funny, or (for most) relatable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

The only thing I would like to see more is a little bit more involvement of his family (especially his wife) as I thought the pace was a little too slow -- the screen time on the sessions between the King and his speech therapist could have been reduced slightly to give way to more emphasis on his family's thoughts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

It was good not to see any signs of modern structures or jet streams ruining the period.Geoffrey Rush portrayed Australians of the period perfectly, without representing us as all ockers. Only flaw was that it seems that Lionel Logue never used profanity in front of the King and did not have him use profanity as an anti-stutter strategy.

The political machinations swirling behind the scenes made for an enthralling subplot. The historical context in which this story took place gave even greater meaning and depth to the overall story. My daughter is a speech pathologist and therefore it had special meaning to us personally.I am sure that anyone who has had public speaking thrust upon them can easily empathize with King George VI and his torturous experience.

Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush deserve Oscars,"At first glance, this movie may not seem like much to write home about. Stripped to its essentials, its the story of a man with a stammer and his struggle to overcome it. It says volumes for the makers of this film that they take this simple plot and create a shining masterpiece! King George VI was a strong, courageous voice to the British people during World War II and Lionel Logue deserves a special footnote in history for he is the one who made that voice possible. This film has such a wonderful message about how one person can overcome adversity and another seemingly ordinary person can make an extraordinary difference in helping him overcome it. Firth is magnificent in his facial expressions and vocal mannerisms. You really believe he does have a stammer and so many times you want to help him seeing his anguish and frustration. His acting is first rate, watch the scene where he tells Logue of his abusive and lonely childhood or the scene where he breaks down realizing the horrible burden he is about to inherit. Rush is wonderful as well and I love the way that the king and the commoner become friends in the end.

Kind of overrated.,"Don't get me wrong, I thought this movie was good. But that's the thing, it was just good. It wasn't anything amazing, mind-blowing, or spectacular, it was just...good. But I don't think it deserved best picture. There are many movies made this year that should have won. Black Swan and The Social Network. Those two movies are amazing. Any one of those should have one. I mean, this is a fine nomination I guess, but to win, really. We all know the only reason the academy picked this is because its an adult melo-drama.The story is behind the speech impediment of King George VI, (Colin Firth) and his developing friendship with his speech coach, (Geoffrey Rush) who teaches him not only to learn how to speak better, but to appreciate and respect himself more as a person.I did enjoy Colin Firth's performance quite a bit, though I have to say that Geoffrey Rush had the better performance and part for the role. I say both him and Colin Firth, should have won. I didn't think Christian Bale's performance in the Fighter was all that great.The film begins with the conflicts before WWII, along with the growing issue involving George's impediment, and the failed attempt by previous doctors to fix it. His wife, (Helena Boham Carter) then finds Lionel Logue, (Geoffrey Rush) whose techniques turn out to be very unusual, but soon develops himself into a great friendship with George. Both Carter and Rush are very supportive. And Colin Firth has himself a heck of a role to play, and, as always, plays it perfectly. The performances and characters are probably the best thing about the film.Though it does drag a little, it didn't drag enough for me to no be able to pay attention, like most draggy movies do. Its not like anything the director did could have made the movie more special, it is what it is. I like the movie, but best picture worth? No. Maybe nominated, but not win. The Social Network and Black Swan were both a lot more interesting than this. Even if the best picture Oscar had to go to this, at least give the directing Oscar to another. I mean, the directing job of The Social Network and Black Swan were both amazing! I'm not saying this director didn't work hard, but I saw commentaries on all three of these movies, showing the directing, and I gotta say that the Social Network itself easily deserved the best director Oscar, as well as best picture.Some may find this a beautiful masterpiece, because they're into this kind of thing, I, on the other hand, find it good. Its not that great, but its not that non-great either. Its just, in the middle. If it hadn't won best picture, I probably wouldn't be talking about it, but since it did. I find it overrated because of that. I like the movie, but I don't love it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
good acting but a boring story,"This movie was OK, but I certainly would not have given it any awards for best movie. But I do think Colin Firth and Geoferry Rush deserved acting awards.

The worst film to ever win Best picture at the Oscars,"i dunno why people like this film. i felt it was terribly written, awfully acted, hammy as hell, horribly shot - those unmotivated use of wide angled lenses and horrible framing. awful, boring film. just a talky stage play and not a very exciting one at that. one of firth's weakest performances. see him in 'fever pitch'. they just didn't create the 30's convincingly. i guess the weinstein muscle can win anything an Oscar nowadays. how they sold this lemon to the entire academy is mystifying. David fincher and 'the social network' were robbed, that was actually a film and not a verbose play posing as a film. i can't remember one visual device in the entire film that was interesting.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The most inspiring speech,"This is a very ordinary film, but no matter how ordinary it is, it doesn't affect making it a perfect work of art. I have seen this film many times, and the school teachers also asked to watch it when I was in school. Even the Education Bureau listed it as a must-see film. How dazzling is it really? In terms of film and television pictures, this is not the case. It can be said that it is very ordinary. It does not even have very good visual image impact, no dazzling beautiful costumes, no good-looking actors, no moving innovative music. All the soundtracks are classical music, but it is a classic film. It is very obvious that this film is a British-style film, with the simple and traditional film and television narrative style of the British Empire. From a commercial standpoint, it is very lossy, and there is no innovation. It feels like reading a textbook, but it is also called a textbook, and its influence is huge. The plot of the story is very simple, which is four words, inheriting the throne, but how to make it into such a delicate and delicate work is really very difficult, but it is a very difficult problem. The actor's lines, as well as the picture of the work and the soundtrack, can be said to be very old-fashioned, but at the same time, it is very delicate, and the actors' acting skills, can be said to find no shortcomings, and the performance is perfect. It is suggested that you can watch it several times. Each time, you will have different experience. Each time, you will have different experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
really excellent!,"A really excellent film, I genuinely believed in King George and the Queens marriage. I was also highly impressed with Colin Firth's stress fuelled stammer which was very convince and never once over the top. During the final scene I even had to grip my friends arm due to suspense!It was well acted, well written, funny, sad and a joy to watch. The only stopping it coming up to a full 10/10 was I felt it was a little long - but I think that may have been my bladder (I'd drunk quite a lot of water!) in retrospect it didn't feel long at all!!Go and see thins film if you want a gentle, lovely and fabulously fun film then god for it!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Sets the Tone From the Start,"The first scene of The King's Speech depicts Albert George (Colin Firth), soon to be King George VI, as he makes a speech at Wembley. The direction and cinematography of this shows the story the film will tell. Trembling hands holding the speech papers, out of focus shots of the speech's words, and stepping up to the podium seeing the crowd through the microphone, this film is about King George's struggle to overcome his fear of public speaking.This is a fear that many people can identify with and the film does an excellent job of bringing that fear to the screen in many different ways. The editing, sound, and cinematography combine to give the film a depth that should be studied and appreciated.The acting is another attribute to the film that give it Best Picture quality. Colin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter, and Geoffrey Rush give arguably the best performance of their respective careers. The screenplay and dialogue gives these actors the resources to bring the story to life and keep the audience invested and entertained.The King's Speech won Best Picture in 2011 and deserved it. It showed quality in all aspects of the medium of film. It seemed like everyone came together and gave their best to make this film special. This is a Best Picture that won't be overlooked. Some of the award winning films are lost in the past but this one will remain in the minds of those who've seen it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Masterful Performances,"King's Speech, The (2010)**** (out of 4)Colin Firth turns in a marvelous performance as King George VI who finds himself working with a speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush) in order to cure a stammer problem. The two men battle over the appropriate cure but things take a turn when England is about to enter WWII and the people are needing a rousing speech to comfort them and lead them forward. THE KING'S SPEECH isn't a flawless film as I had a few minor issues with it including some of the early stuff building up to the eventual speech. I'd say the film could have ran a few minutes shorter but the performances here are so wonderful that you can overlook the minor issues. I don't think there's any question that both Firth and Rush deliver two of the best performances in recent years because they are so good that you never once feel as if you're watching actors but instead you feel as if you're actually in the room with the real people that they are playing. The performances are so flawless that they have no problem bringing the wonderful and witty dialogue to life. The film, for the most part, is a comedy because it's a pretty strange situation when a man who makes his name by talking isn't able to get more than a word out. The drama comes in as the famous speech is coming upon him and King George must deliver the news that they are entering WWII. Being a fact-based film I'm sure most people are going to know what happens but the amount of drama in this sequence is thrilling and will have your eyes glued to the screen. Firth comes across as a decent but weak man while Rush must come across as a decent but strong man. The two are total opposites but through their differences they find that magic to make the story work so well. Both men are bound to get Oscar-nominations and I don't think anyone would boo if they actually won. Firth is masterful with all the speech stuff. I've seen countless movies where actors have to stutter but Firth is flawless and really delivers what the role needs. The speech problem really seems so natural that you never feel as if you're watching a performance. When the final speech does come up the amount of energy, passion and fire in Firth's eyes alone are worth the price of admission. Rush also turns in one of his most memorable performances in a very long time. What really impressed me about Rush was his comic timing, which was like a beautiful chorus that the actor had to dance around and be right on cue at every moment. The two men do a marvelous job together and make the film what it is. Helena Bonham Carter is also wonderful as the King's wife and Guy Pearce is also memorable as the brother. THE KING'S SPEECH is more about the strange friendship than any sort of politics, which is a good thing because the screenplay delivers enough fire to keep people entertained even if they don't know this part of history. The performances by the leads are what makes THE KING'S SPEECH so special and reason alone to watch.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A must for drama and history lovers alike,"Stars: Colin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter, Geoffrey Rush, Michael Gambon, Guy Pearce, Timothy Spall The Plot: The King's Speech is a true story about Britain's King George VI (Colin Firth) who suffered a debilitating stammer and was helped to address a nation over the radio at the onset of World War Two by his Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) Rated: 12A Running time: 118 minutes Award Nods: 12 Academy, seven Golden Globe, 11 Critics Choice and four Screen Actors Guild awards nomination.It would be a HUGE injustice and understatement to say this is the film of the year since its only January but using my power of foresight I can see it being hard to top this one in my eyes. It's a rare thing for me to be gripped by a film, the last being Inglorious. I admit I was a little dubious as it had so much hype and its not my normal sort of film. Firth is splenetic, humorous and heartwarming all rolled into one sexy British ball. It is no surprise he is favourite to win best asctor award. Helena Bonham Carter is wonderfully charming as Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon and Geoffrey Rush is a great comic actor. My favourite scene being with him sitting in The Coronation Chair.This film has it all: great actors, a great story and a pretty interesting lesson in British history. I came away with a lot of knowledge and a desire to know more. I was on Wikipedia the next day! Its dramatic, funny and engaging and I was left wanting more.A big fat five stars!!

"The King's Speech (2010) Is Another British Monarchy ""Behind The Scenes"" Movie","The King's Speech (2010) starring Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter, directed by Tom Hooper is yet another Hollywood movie about the British monarchy which joins The Queen (2008) and The Madness Of King George III (both of the latter featuring Helen Mirren as the Queen of England, past and present).The next Royal Wedding is coming up soon as Prince William marries later this year, and the tabloids and other newspapers and watchers of the British Royals are getting ready for the spectacle of it all.Interest in the British Royals is ""in the air,"" even more than usual, since the soon to be married prince may well become the next King should his father, Prince Charles, give the job of being his mother's replacement and the next King of England a miss.The King's Speech (2010) movie shows us the insides of many grand Royal places well photographed in wonderful color. It is a sort of travelogue, and that makes the movie's many, many shortcomings worth putting up with.The acting is good to the extent the actors have material to work with. However, the script is weak and gives actors little range, and repeats dramatic situations good when viewers first see them, but stale when repeated. For the first 20 minutes or so, we enjoy and appreciate the considerable talents and actor expertise of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush (who play King George VI and his speech therapist respectively), we are shown the anguish of the King faced with speech problems he has, and the humor and teaching talents of the therapist in duet scenes the movie starts out with.Unfortunately, the movie fizzles after the first 20 minutes, and we see nothing new for the rest of the show. Just more anguish and more clever teaching done with humor. It gets old. Not the actors fault. They were and are good. But the screenwriter and the producers who hired the screenwriter simply didn't deliver the goods, but rather served up formulaic bromides about the inflexibility of King George V, the father of King George VI, the controversy and criticism which surrounded the future Duke of Windsor and his American girlfriend and future wife (Wallis Simpson, who like Camilla Bowles, Prince Charles' current wife, was divorced), and Hitler and the Nazis in Germany.Nothing new or original or interesting is part of any of that, and the movie lags and lags as a result.But the visual part of it all is good, and the lovely settings used and shown are terrific. The gigantic rooms, the expensive furniture, the grovelling servants and deference paid to the Royals by England's trained servile population are all there to see and capture our interest.It's an OK movie, and not more than that. Hollywood and the movie community worldwide have created great masterpieces over the history of movies as an art form, a history now more than a century old. WWW.Amazon.Com will sell used copies very cheap of the world's greatest movies (see the Library Of Congress National Film Registry List for 475 titles all worth seeing, all cheap in used form from Amazon.Com).The King's Speech (2011) has many good points and parts, but it is not a great movie.

A Genuine Film,"A film of this magnitude only comes around maybe four times in a century. It will leave you wondering on how no other film this past year could even coming close to this film. Colin Firth played the role as King George (Bertie) and he played that part better than anyone I've seen since Morgan Freeman played Red in The Shawshank Redemption. He gave such a great classic performance that sure would have made Bogart, Malden, Cotton, and Gable very proud. You don't come along wonderful acting like what he did too often. It had a great cast with Helena Bonham-Carter, the fantastic Geoffrey Rush, Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill, Guy Pearce, and Michael Gambon. Tom Hooper did an amazing job directing this film. All I can say to David Seidler is, ""way to go. You wrote a fantastic movie that will be remembered."" This movie will run with The Oscars as well it should.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Not a big enough story,"Colin Firth gives a flawless performance as George VI in this very British tale all about the unlikeliest King in British history. There's a distinct historical atmosphere set very early in the movie and it does manage to keep you interested right up until the movie's slightly sickly sweet ending. I am sorry to say though that terrific talents like Helena Bonham-Carter and Geoffrey Rush are a bit wasted here. The story just isn't big enough to justify having heavy weight actors like Bonham-Carter and Rush in supporting roles. There's also a cameo role for Michael Gambon as George's father George V. The period is very well created in the movie and if Oscars are being handed out there may well be one for the costume designers. Guy Pearce gives a believable enough performance as George's abdicating brother, Edward VIII and there's lots of familiar faces from British TV and film popping up. No doubt it will be a huge hit with American audiences who can't seem to get enough of ""British Posh"" these days. Good luck explaining the ""constitutional crisis"", to them by the way. For this reviewer though, there's just too much incongruity between the very simple story and the heavy dramatic production. A more light hearted production might have been more appropriate. But none of my criticisms should detract from a beautiful performance by Colin Firth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

My Favourite Bromance!,"OMG, when I say believe the hype about this film, believe it! Just saw it today and it's one of those experiences on the big screen that makes you forget where you are in the moment, truly astounding. And so far it's my film of 2011.Colin Firth continues to impress me as an actor, and clearly, the man knows his stuff when it comes to picking roles. From Fever Pitch to The King's Speech, how did that happen? I have to say, that I much prefer this to The Queen, probably because I'm a sucker for wartime period drama, with subtle hints of PG Wodehouse thrown in for good measure! I cannot compliment the production team enough in re-creating a post Second World War Britain and Tom Hooper who just got the best from all of his cast. And for the record, why are people saying Timothy Spall was hamming it up as Winston Churchill? He's playing a larger than life figure who was renowned for his robustness and stature (a different time and style of Government, people). You can't go wrong when you have cameos from greats, such as Michael Gambon whose voice alone could command a naval fleet; Guy Pearce as King Edward VIII; or in my opinion, a louche-douche and Helena Bonham Carter as a younger Queen Mum (amazing what she can churn out when she's not directed by her wacky hubby, Tim Burton!) I never understood Colin's reference in his Golden Globes acceptance speech, when he referred to Geoffrey Rush as his Geisha Girl (after seeing TKS, it made sense). These two are more dynamic than Batman and Robin and would cut more dashing figures with their capes! When you hear about actors finding a beat in their lines, in that rhythm, Firth & Rush do that with great delight. Personally, I could sit in a room with these gents and wax lyrical all day long, I kid you not. Their on screen relationship is everything a Bromance should be: Defiance, crossing the line and inevitably, loyalty.I was emailed a list of Oscar winners by my buddy, and because I'd not seen TKS, I chose the Social Network and Jeremy Renner as winners. Well, I'm certain that Geoffrey Rush will beat Christian Bale to the Best Supporting Actor nod in March, as will TKS as best picture (and as a surly reminder to this douche-bag Conservative Govt, why do they want to close down the UK Fim Council, when clearly, they can produce feel-good gems like this? The mind boggles).Have to say it again: Firth & Rush, thank you for the Bromance and look forward to seeing it at least 2 more times at my cinema & countless times on Blu-ray.PS: When I compile my top 5 actors of all time and Geoffrey Rush isn't on the list, feel free to take it in turns and kick my ass, please?",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
An inspiring well made historical drama,"Sometimes this kind of historical Drama Films tend to rush in story- telling letting voids in the script that leads to an incomprehensible mess that just the ones who are familiar with the story can comprehend. Fortunately ""The King's Speech"" have succeed where other has failed. The Director, Tom Hooper, has been able to perfectly condensate the story the whole story in two hours with a very fast paced rhythm that never decrease and a fabulous and very faithful recreation of the epoch in which the story takes place that drags you into the story from the beginning until the end.The Film it's based on true events in the life of King George VI , The plot explores his troublesome relationship with his family but especially focus in the relationship with his speech therapist who helped him to overcome his problems of stammering.Colin Firth plays the George VI in one of the finest performances of his career, he was able to display on the screen the vulnerability and insecurity of his character, portraying the man beyond the myth but his performance wouldn't be that great without the supporting role of Geoffrey Rush as his speech Therapist, he brings refreshing small doses of humour into the story, encouraging to the audience ,showing us that working hard there is nothing that we can't achieve. Their scenes together are the key of the Film, both actors together works perfectly as the fundamental pillars in which the whole movie relies on.The Film was written by David Seidler, a man who suffered of stammering in his youth and was inspired in the story of King George to write the script that has been also adapted as a Theatre play. This is exactly what it makes this film so special, besides its undeniable quality as a film, it's very inspiring and encourage to everyone to overcome their fears and insecurities..WONDERFUL FILM, A MUST SEE",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Professional's Assessment,"Every once in a rare while, planets do align and writers, actors and directors get it right. And here we are. The confluence of events that create this narrative appear, on the surface, to be rare but they are not; they have just finally been truthfully presented. Here we have a human being (in this case, the Duke of York) in dire need of help - one whom everyone would suspect to have the world's resources at his fingertips, and yet, not a soul in sight who is at once uniquely knowledgeable enough and selfless enough to do so b/c of meanness and self-absorption (King George in disappointment with his son, a self- absorbed brother). This movie underscores the fact that only by forgetting ourselves and engaging with others, can we lift ourselves.Enter Carter, who forges the confluence by marrying Firth's desperate situation with the forces of a would-be-""speech therapist"" (which by the way does not truly exist, but that is the subject of another discussion). Enter the helper, Lionel Logue (I'm confident that the reference to logopedics will not be lost on most). It has been said that wisdom is using knowledge with compassion. Rush's eyes realistically bespeak the professional suspension of personal selves (here, speech/language pathologists), necessary in order to clinically separate the disorder from the person and thus dismantle it, while simultaneously embracing that whole pained human being looking into our eyes. Geoffrey Rush has captured the essence of the wise helper, for whom nothing less than every bit of knowledge ever learned must be employed to lift others out of an abyss, and in so doing, lift ourselves. It is a story about surpassing yourself and forcing others to do so.Of note is the power issue. Titles create screens to hide behind, and there is no hiding in the true helping relationship.This play on titles is woven throughout the film as Rush refuses to allow Firth to define him as ""doctor"" and himself as ""Duke"" or ""King."" We have here a beautifully rendered twist on Aesop's Lion and the Mouse, the original lesson about the folly of power and the truth of helping.Realistic writing, superb acting, excellent messages -",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A serious Oscar contender!!!,"This is the first year i've had the pleasure to screen all movies as to which i think will be top contenders for this year's Oscar awards. I have been disappointed by some IE; The Social Network, but overall i think the Academy have done well in their decision making. Yes I know its a little early as the Oscar noms haven't even been delivered as of yet however The Golden Globes have and they are usually a pretty good indicator of whats to come. When i originally saw the trailer for this i had thought that this looked utterly boring as i am not a fan of the time period represented in this film although I am definitely a fan of historical true life stories and thats why i gave this a chance. I will start by saying good thing i did as I was presented by yet another favourite trait in movies i see and that being power house acting. Out of the 5 nominees in this years golden globes (for last years movies however) I have seen all but 1 in the best acting category and thats Ryan Gosling's performance in Blue Valentine and that is next on my list to do. I don't agree with two of the nominees Jessie Eisenberg and James Franco however the rest are so deserving of a win. The man who won the Golden Globe was The King's Speech's own Colin Firth. I had originally only seen Firth in a handful of things IE;Mamma Mia and the Bridget Jones movies and unfortunately have not seen his 2009 also nominated for an acting nod film The Single Man but plan to do so also. He is one of the reasons that i choose my top 5 actors and that he can damn well do a good job of making you believe he is the character in which he is portraying. Firth in this portrays King George VI who since the invention of the radio has now been forced to deliver his ailing father's speeches to the citizens of England all the midst of having a stuttering problem. His wife finds him a speech therapist Lionel Loque (Geoffrey Rush) in a bid to finally cease this impediment unbeknowst to her that Lionel and Bertie (King George's pet name given to him by his closest family members as to which Lionel insists on calling him nothing but) would not only deal with the pending speech problem but also start what will be a lifelong friendship. This movie not only shows you the value of a good strong friendship it also shows you the pressures one faces while being a royal family member.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
percentage shot,"I have just seen The King's speech, the movie who won some Oscars in 2010. I have to say I was disappointed which doesn't mean the movie is bad, but it certainly isn't as outstanding as its ranking may suggest.The performances were good, but that was to be expected from such good actors. However the actors were playing stereotypes like we have seen too often in movies before. They were full of clichés like the Royal who becomes a friend with a normal citizen (message: restoring our faith in government) and shows that he is not a super human, even suffers from an impairment that can be overcome (message: if he can do it, you can do it, too).It's an average movie for the broadest possible audience - I would call it a percentage shot movie. Everything about the movie felt calculated. The story was predictable and I had the feeling I was watching an educational didactic play. Schools should show this movie to adolescents.There was nothing in its spirit to lift the movie and rise above the average, surprise me and make it memorable or at least linger in my mind, heart or soul for longer than the end credits.I am aware that my review places me in the minority but I cannot ignore the calculating and uninspired aspect of this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Complete garbage,"Aside from the lack of historical accuracy, the movie is just a feel good story for the dumbed down masses.

It's complete and utter filler. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Don't waste your time/money watching happy ending melodramas like this and fill your life with things that are more meaningful. I am very disappointed with the way Oscars are handed these days.

This film isn't for everyone.,The King's Speech is about a reluctant king overcoming his speech impediment to help his country gain the courage to fight Nazi Germany.The King's Speech is a story behind an epic moment in time. Look closely and you will see that it's in the same spirit of those too-wild-to-be-true-but-still-true films like Wolf of Wall Street or War Dogs.Set pieces are true to its era and the musical score blends in with the scenes.It will be a bit slow in some parts.

An Intimate look at the life of Royalty and how it Shaped History!,"Set in Pre-WWII England, Prince Albert (Colin Firth), the King's youngest son, has a stuttering problem. His wife Elizabeth (Carter), in desperation, seeks out an unorthodox elocutionist (Rush). The three of them embark on a great journey that exposes the human in all of us and plays an intricate part of History.One of the greatest movies you'll ever see this year! It's a wonderful exchange between the Nobility and common classes exacted through the roles of these great actors. The writing is brilliant and the delivery is classic without being too boring.Who knew being a member of the Royal family would have so much pressure attached? Firth's depiction of such a pivotal historical figure must invoke an even deeper love of England's King. Rush's anti-groveling is quite-witted and entertaining. Carter is wonderful.

Disappointing - could have been so much more!,"In spite of the many rave reviews, I must admit that I personally found the movie disappointing. Unlike most viewers, I was well acquainted with the story of this royal couple before viewing the movie. Bottom line - I expected more. Their story is so rich with material. The king's speech problems were just one of the many issues the royal couple faced, particularly during the wartime. Yet it was the only one singled out here as a theme for the movie and I felt that it was simply not enough to carry a whole movie for 2 hours. Otherwise, everything else was fine - the settings, costumes, acting, choice of actors etc. - it all was done well as far as it went, but I felt it simply didn't go far enough. The wartime sacrifices of the royal couple were not sufficiently highlighted, their bravery, their struggles. All were more of a background to the central issue of the king's speech problem. I would have preferred a rich tapestry where the speech problem had equal footing with the many other issues confronting the royal couple. For those not familiar with the royal couple's story, dealing with the speech impediment might be enough. For me, it wasn't. I wanted more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Will have a lasting impression but to go till the end, have patience please.","Just watched it for the second time to understand the screenplay. The first time I did, i had to take a break but now I saw it in one go. The screenplay is simple, it does not have many scenes and is mostly shot interiors with the major part being the confrontations of the King and his speech therapist.OK to begin the review with, the first notice would go to art direction and sets as this is a period film and they are immaculate and beautiful. The performances surely top notch specifically of Geoffrey Rush who acted as speech therapist Lionel but the more tougher one was of the King, played by Colin Firth and he came out with flying colors delivering the act. He stammers so well. The camera work is simple, it remains faithful to the spirit if the film by not providing funky or exuberant angles but providing straight angles. The music direction has to be so much recommended as it brought back the Symphonies alive.But yet, I have not discussed the part that is best about this, it is it's writing, the writing of screenplay and the direction of Tom Hooper who sticks strictly to what it is, The King's speech how he learnt to speak and propagate his voice. Though there is huge history at it's backdrop, be it the world war 2 time of time of great importance to England adding to the death of the earlier king and the heir who was given the thrown, abdicates it and thus the Duke of York as he was named at the beginning, takes over as the King of British.His reluctance is well expressed and so is his anguish, he does not stammer when he sings or shouts and thats what is caught by his teacher and helps him.Having said all that, it's not a movie of history or about speech therapy, it's a simple and well told of how a man overcame his misgiving and fought to stand erect. Though this is a great movie that is so absorbing, I doubt if it is the best one I saw in last year as it had been given numerous awards. Surely, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush deserve acclaim.Rating : 3/5. Will have a lasting impression but to go till the end, have patience please.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Great actors for a tepid film,"Great acting, boring film. As said elsewhere, this is way below The Queen. A regal version of a buddy movie.Firth does a great job but the director is obviously not willing to bet on it, since he turns the music on every time that Firth engages in long stammering periods. And, what is unforgivable, he adds music even to the King's Speech, the one the whole film has been leading to. We should be listening to it as the millions of listeners heard it that day: no music, radio cracking noises, ambient sound. But no, we get Firth + violins because the director does not seem to think that Firth alone can carry the scene.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"The King's Speech is, simply, Eloquent","Most of the other reviewers have already summed up what it is about, so I will just say this; I saw this film almost by accident-- my initial first choice was another movie, and I usually don't tend to get too excited about historical and period works. So I nearly passed on this one. Boy, would that ever have been a HUGE mistake! Colin Firth invests the character of the Duke of York (later King George VI) as a man facing a debilitating impediment, with not only humanity and warmth but an incredible sense of humor as well. The relationship between himself and the speech therapist Lionel Logue, at the heart of the story, is movingly portrayed. I was truly, utterly blown away. Do yourself a favor this holiday season, and DON'T miss this one!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
One of the best British films in cinematic history. Sensational.,"I initially put off seeing The King's Speech when it first came out despite knowing and liking actors like Colin Firth and Helen Bonham Carter. The reason was because I'm not really that interested in the Royal family and didn't know anything about the true story, but curiosity of the amazing hype this has received from film critics in the newspapers and audience reviews alike on here propelled me to go and see it. When arriving and I noticed at other screenings in the past two weeks when I had gone to see other films, I saw two things loads of people going in to see it and that the majority were middle-aged and older. I don't know if it's been the same at other screenings across the country, but that was the general population of the type of people that went in, but that didn't deter me. I entered the cinema and the Que was long and the screening I was in was literally fully packed, but this didn't mean the hype conjured was accurate. I was wrong. At the end quite literally I was speechless.First of all though a brief synopsis of the movie. Basically set in the 1920s and 30s, this tells the story of how King George VI (Colin Firth) who had a stammering problem when speaking receives help from an Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush)to control his stammering so he can do speeches, whilst his supported by his wife Queen Elizabeth (Helen Bonham Carter). Throughout George or Bertie as most of his family and friends call him tries to gain more confidence as eventually he takes the throne over from his brother who is forced to abdicate. Lionel and George strike an unlikely friendship as he helps him prepare for a speech which we will see the King guide England through the war against Germany.First off to say the cinematography is marvellous with a detail which is superbly rich from the costumes, vehicles and buildings of the time. I was transfixed throughout visually marvelling at it, the script was excellently written with mature and witty dialogue, with some hilarious laughs. For the first hour the story only interested me, but by the second hour it had gripped me. This was due to the incredible performances across the board. Colin Firth deserves an Oscar for his performance. He gives the performance of his life, it's the best acting I've ever seen him do and one of the finest I've ever seen in film. You feel for his character of King George who wants to do his duty but resents it at the same time as he tries hard to overcome his stammering. He is also extremely warm hearted as he just wants to make his wife and children proud. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as Lionel with a quirkiness for the character who is intelligent but quick witted. The scenes with Rush and Firth are some of the best in the whole film, Helen Bonham Carter deserves to be mentioned and should receive at least an Oscar nomination. She with the right material is a genius of an actress and gives a magnificent supporting performance. Also small cameos by Timothy Spall as a sympathetic Winston Churchill and Michael Gambon as George's father are superb and make the most of their screen time.This really is a moving and riveting film and the thing I loved was that the friendship between Bertie and Lionel never became sentimental. Director Tom Cooper wisely restrained that and it makes the film all the more moving and charming for it. When Bertie makes the speech near the end I was silently praising him as he went through. He had a lot of courage and it showed. At the end everyone including me clapped. This truly is one of the best British films in history and deserves a handful of awards. 2011 certainly is becoming a memorable year for movies as I saw four previously which were either very good or exceptional. The King's Speech is exceptional and is one of the most unforgettable films of our time. Seriously go and see this, even if you don't know about the story or have much interest in royalty. You might be shockingly surprised like I was. The King's Speech is the best film of the year so far and even though for me there are a couple of serious contenders, they will have to work hard to triumph over this. Either way this is one movie that is very difficult to forget. Absolutely sensational.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Historically very dodgy but an acting tour de force in the lead role,"All three lead players (Helena Bonham Carter, Geoffrey Rush and, of course, Colin Firth) are first rate but it is really Firth's film. His acting is just breath-taking and he really makes you feel for and with a figure from history with whom most people would probably not think they have much to share at all.The historical 'background', though, is very much a 'right on' adaptation / tailored for a British/US 2011 audience and full of errors which a history teacher would spot immediately, e.g. Churchill being 'at the centre of things' in the 1930s right up to the outbreak of war (or even for 'Bertie' and against 'David') - ridiculous; Baldwin feeling he had 'failed' (especially over foreign policy) whereas in fact he retired (rather than resigned) in a glow of popularity for having 'sorted out' the mess of the Abdication - nonsense; the prospect of his saying, in resigning, 'So Winston was right all along' - complete rubbish (as they had in fact been at daggers drawn since 1930) and, overall, it has to be said, the idea that the vast bulk of the UK populace (and especially many in high social and political circles (the true feelings of Bertie and Elizabeth towards Chamberlain are not shown in any real way either)) had any feeling that war with Nazi Germany was inevitable until well into 1938 (and, in fact, early 1939 for very many when, despite his assurances at Munich, Hitler (by now hell-bent on war (although not necessarily with Britain and France)) simply marched into Prague/the remainder of Czechoslovakia without any discussions whatsoever with London or Paris and, in doing so, convinced the vast majority of people that he was a lying scoundrel and someone who was determined to gain his (insane) ambitions no matter what it cost (to other countries and even the German people).",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Too slow for my liking,"Yes this was a great film, but it was way too slow paced for my liking. The 2 hour length should have been cut down to 1:20 - 1:30 mins. However, Tom Hopper's directing was great but I guess you are limited in what you can achieve with the script handed to you. Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter were great in their roles, although their characters seemed a little stale. Nevertheless, I guess it all depends on ones taste, so it's only a 6/10 from me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Man am I embarrassed or am I embarrassed .... Boy that was a brilliant drama!,"Man that was excruciating watching Colin Firth stammer at the speech hours! But what a great performance ...... what a great performance. Why? Would I be surprised if Colin receives an Academy for this one. No not at all. Brilliant movie. Brilliant cast. Brilliant direction by Tom Hooper and a brilliant story by David Seidler.The King's speech is the story of King George VI of England prior to the time of World War II. While Bertie(Colin Firth) is forced to take on the throne as his elder brother abdicates because he decides to marry a divorced woman whom he loved (which is unacceptable for a king), Bertie is reluctant coz he stammers and lacks self confidence. He hires Lionel Logue(Geoffrey Rush) a speech therapist as suggested by his wife Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) to treat him to get rid of the stammer. His unconventional methods surprise Bertie which causes him to discontinue his services in the beginning and also when Lionel starts getting involved with the king's business although he returns to Lionel as his unconventional methods start to work on him. It used to get really embarrassing watching the king struggle with the words while people raised placards saying ""God save the king"" albeit Lionel assists him to get his fluency and works wonder eventually.The drama is well depicted and well assisted by some great performances by Geoffrey Rush, Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter. The direction by Tom Hooper was brilliant. The flick was well strewn with catchy phrases and some great dialogues. There is one scene that depicts Hitler giving a speech to the German army (in German of course) while everyone was listening to him. One of Bertie's daughters asks him what he was saying to which he replies: ""I don't know but, he seems to be saying it rather well.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"An Unusual & Inspiring True Story of Stammering King George VI... Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter were splendid to watch!!","THE KING'S SPEECH – CATCH IT ( A ) The King's Speech is an unusual & enchanting experience, its nothing like I have seen before. I have seen numerous movies and shows depicting the English monarch but nothing like it. It's a very humorous and delicate look into the Life of Stammering King George VI. The delicate disability of King George VI is told in very humorous yet sensitive way. Kudos to the Director and screen writer who presented Otherwise Dry subject in a very humorous way so the viewer can enjoy the whole process of it. Colin Firth as King George VI is spot on, Colin Firth has done numerous memorable roles in his life but his portrayal of King George VI is nothing like we have seen before. The King's anger, anguish, emotion, joy, love and hesitate has been brilliantly portrayed by phenomenon Colin Firth. I truly believe that Colin Firth will win Oscar for his SpeechLess performance about Stammering King George VI. Colin Firth also got lucky to have Geoffrey Rush playing the tutor's part. O'God, his Witt was impeccable. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush make an Unlikely pairing which is hardly ever seen. Helena Bonham Carter stays on back but provide the utmost strength to Colin Firth's character. It's good to see her after a long time as from decades she is been playing over the top Gothic roles. Guy Pierce and Eve Best were good. On the Whole, The King's Speech is a fresh breeze into the Cinematic British Monarch Obsession, which will never get old, so, it's good to see new takes on British Monarch's Rich famous history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
is alright,"Watching the kings speech is like watching someone in physical pain for two hours. Credit to Collin Firth for making every sentence seem like an ordeal.

Phenom Acting!,"I am 26, i don't know much about George the VI so i went in not knowing much or very interested, but i came out impressed! The lead acting by Colin Firth is superb! He made this role seem so effortless thats how realistic it was, you would believe Colin has a stutter in real life, To just see how well Colin portrayed his character was great! He is always a great lead to have in a movie. I still love his performance in Love Actually. Colins Acting by far got 10/10 in my book. The supporting cast of Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter was amazing as well. As Bertie's speech teacher and friend he did an amazing job of holding his own, He had some funny lines, and some very touching serious lines as well that truly touched me. Finally Helena what can i say i love her small roles in ever film shes been in, she just has the awe to her and respect when the camera is put on her, she to me is a very unique actress and can play any role giving to her. Overall Geoffrey Performance 9.1/10 and Helenas 9.4/10.

"Terrific screen writing, and two actors at their symbiotic best","The King's Speech (2010)From the title itself through classic encounters of the king with the peasantry to the final speech of all speeches, ""The King's Speech"" is fast, smart, and literate. I say literate specifically because this is one witty, word-based movie. A brilliant one. It is visual, too, dramatically photographed (including some unusual extreme wide angle views--not fisheye as Manohla Dargis said), and it is acted with absolute skill. But above all, it is a work of words.Appropriately.David Seidler is the credited screenwriter here, and he has done mostly decent television writing. His one attempt that relates, for ""The King and I"" o (1999) was miserably received. Here, he is nothing short of sublime. It might seem easy to play with the conventions of British royalty (the stumbling for the proper words, the decorum), but the dialog goes well beyond that. It is largely a tale of two men, the man who would be King George VI and his speech therapist Lionel Logue, and no one knows what they said to one another.The plot, however, is a given, sort of. The movie is based on fact in the broad sense--the king did have a stutter, Logue was an inventive therapist from Australia, German and Britain did go to war. Memoirs being what they are, and Logue's notebooks being only part of the story, the dialog has come under criticism for his truth. But watch this movie as a work of fiction, somehow, and you'll hear some of the sharpest speechwriting in recent years. Screenwriter David Seidler grew up with a stutter, has had a lifelong fascination with King George VI, and has recently battled cancer, which has a way of giving people perspective. All of this is audible in the film, start to finish.And it's a very very funny movie, or witty in the dry sense. Nearly everything out of Colin Firth's mouth is hilarious, like an inner voice speaking out and surprising expectations. And Logue, played to a T by Geoffrey Rush, is equally hilarious, restrained perhaps but more theatrical by far. The two of them are stunning.The movie is of course limited by its own intentions. Certain things--most things--cannot happen, and don't. The inventions are either liberties that they have gotten thrashed for (see Wikipedia for a long list of corrections) or are little inventions between the facts that make things airy and touching, realistic and pithy. The filming enhances this, and the use of deeply moving music punches up the gravitas more than anything.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Amazing performances and style, but at times felt a bit bored...but still a great film!","A character driven story seeing 'Bertie' cope with his stammer problem, being thrown into kingship and dealing with the coming of WW2. Colin Firth was brilliant, defiantly deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. There were moments in the film when we really got a deep insight into his character. He was not just a king, but a person with qualities and emotion. Helena Bonham Carter was great as Bertie's wife as she had class and she played the role really well of being Bertie's support system. Geoffrey Rush as Bertie's speech therapist was an interesting character, he was funny and great to watch. All characters was great to watch and had something unique about them. The style of the film was top class as well. If there was one criticism i would say it did feel, at times, quite dreary but i think the characters kept the film up and kept you watching. Plus there is repetition of the ""F"" word but only in speech therapy context to loosen Bertie up. All in all, a good watch and i think if you are a historian you'll love it even more. I'm not leaping off my chair but i'm not sitting down criticising the whole film. Good effort.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The King's SpeechOh, great, a British king is about to speak – now I'm going to need a Cockney slang to lucid English dictionary.And while the articulating monarch in this drama ain't 'aving a giraffe, his North and South is all out of sorts.Following a public decree, where he stumbled over his words, Prince Albert (Colin Firth), on the behest of his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), seeks the aid of an experimental speech therapist, Lionel (Geoffrey Rush), in an attempt to alleviate his speech impediment.Apprehensive with the unorthodox treatment at first, when he ascends to the throne of England, Albert finds remedy in his friend's madness, as well as a secret past.Though a superlative cast graces it, this recounting of actual events is nothing but a pretentious factoid prolonged into a humdrum historical recollection.And while a stuttering king is startling, it's not as shocking as a lisping queen.

Sometimes it ain't so great to be king.,"With Hitler about to throw the world into chaos and his elder brother and first in line for the throne of England shirking his duties to slavishly chase of all things a twice divorced, well traveled American, the future King of England, George VI (Colin Firth) is about to have the awesome weight of leading Great Britain in its most dire hour thrust upon him. Cursed with a stammer since the age of four he is ill equipped to do so in the age of the wireless but duty demands it and his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) desperately seeks a cure. Literally and figuratively making her way through a London fog she engages the help of an Australian (Geoffrey Rush) speech therapist who employs unorthodox methodology. Reluctantly the future king acquiesces to treatment but it's a bumpy ride all the way.The King's Speech is a gripping historical film that deals with the fate of the world in drawing room drama fashion. The conflagration that will engulf all of Europe has yet to begin but we are all aware of what's next and the pressure and frustration of awesome responsibility worn on the face and in the stuttering cadence of the future king is as tense as any panoramic battle scene.Director Tom Hooper does an excellent job of staying on point without letting Speech becoming too dependent on dialogue. Camera movement and editing give the film the energy George by virtue of his handicap of fits and starts cannot. Remaining faithful to history he gives brief but effective glimpses of the major players ( George V, Baldwin , Churchill, Queen Mary ) of the day economically conveying the strain of duty over self. In addition Barry Cohen's cinematography deftly compliments the sober mood with muted canvases, making the most of the few exteriors with some dazzling pertinent imagery without calling attention to itself.The supporting cast of Bonham Carter, Derek Jacobi, Guy Pearce Michael Gambon and Claire Bloom among others are uniformly precise while Geoffrey Rush's speech therapist displaying a flawed confidence with a hint of vanity is an excellent foil and counterbalance in scene after scene with the frazzled heir to the throne. It is Colin Firth's towering performance as ""Bertie"" though that gives The King's Speech it's voice. He may be royalty but he is also nothing but a man hobbled by a crippling defect and Firth conveys it with magnificent nuance. Ill fitted to deal with greatness in its three forms ""Bertie"" is both sympathetic and a prig. Waylaid as he is by his malady he is fully aware of his station in life and Firth is equally adept at being cruel and condescending within that vulnerability. Suffice to say Mr. Firth will soon be in need of a much larger mantelpiece at home as well as being addressed differently in the future for a career paved with standout performances with this arguably his finest hour.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Well-done and acted,"The King's Speech is the last film I have seen that is a big contender in the Oscars, and it is a well-made film with solid story-telling and a great performance by Colin Firth. He commands the screen with his presence and just like a year ago in his film A Single Man he carries the film. Working with him are the talented Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, and Guy Pearce. The first two are getting awards recognition and will likely be nominated for an Oscar, the latter has no chance. Carter has very limited screen time and it's sort of a surprise she is getting notice. However, no other actress would have been able to make more of an impression than her. She really does have only a few lines here and there, but her face says everything. I don't know if I would put her in my personal line-up but I am proud of her. Rush has a bigger character and more screen time and he is completely charming. Pearce I thought came out of nowhere in an even more limited performance but was completely impressive. Pearce is one of the most criminally-underrated actors working today and he completely dismersed into character. I cannot believe he is still not an Oscar-nominee. What a shame.Overall, I really liked it. However, it was never completely intriguing enough for me to call it one of the year's best films, and after seeing it now I don't think it will win the Oscar for Best Picture especially with The Social Network looming around. However, it's a very well-made film with enough ambition to be respected.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Tom Hooper manages to give a fantastic direction in the film, and the images and scenarios that he uses are impressive builds the film by every minute that passes.

It's the biopic that tells the story of how King George VI (Colin Firth), the father of Queen Elizabeth II, overcame his stuttering problem. Being considered incapable by everyone except for his father to be king.George is reluctantly thrust to the throne after his brother David (Guy Pearce) is forced to abdicate. Overshadowed on the global stage by powerful orators like Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini, the King relies on the help of a little known Australian therapist, named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to find his voice and boldly lead his people to mankind more devastating war has ever faced.The film manages to deliver a powerful, hilarious and poignant story, said against the backdrop of a critical moment in modern history. All thanks to the screenplay by David Seidler which is excellent. The British dry humor that David adds to the film's hilarious and fits perfectly in the movie. Placing an amazing reality on the characters, we see for the 1st time that the royal people are human beens like any other normal people with their own personal problems as anyone. Geoffrey Rush does a fantastic job, as well Helena Bonham Carter (as the wife of King George).

The King's Speech,"Geoffrey Rush and Colin Firth make for quite a pairing in this touching drama of King George VI and his speech impediment. Being called upon for public speaking only increased the anxiety of the then Duke of York (Firth) and so his wife (Helena Bonham Carter) decided that there had to be a better way to treat her husband than sticking an handful of marbles in this mouth. She, as ""Mrs. Johnson"" sets up a chat with speech therapist Lionel Logue (Rush) and he, having no idea who she really is, only agrees to see him if he comes to his consulting room. Unfamiliar with the backchat, but impressed by his independent mindedness, TRH duly arrive and once Logue gets over the shock, he begins to deal with his new, cash-are, client in a polite but hardly deferential fashion. Gradually we see that progress is being made. Not just with the confidence of the Prince at speechifying, but also with his attitude and behaviour in general. He likes Logue, Logue likes him and thanks to some airfix kits, quite a bit of the old Anglo-Saxon and all under the discreet but potent supervision of the Duchess, the young man comes better prepared for what is to come next - after the Abdication Crisis, that is... There's a great rapport between the two men here as this speculative story offers us a plausible and engaging look at just how tough and unforgiving society was to those who stammered - regardless of their rank. Rush also juggles Logue's role of a career man with that of a loving family man well as well as a budding Thespian entertainingly too. Astutely, Tom Hooper leaves the vast majority of the film to just those two men. HBC adds a touch of diversion now and again and Sir Derek Jacobi weighs in as the outwardly rather unsympathetic Archbishop Lang but for the most part it's just them. It's history, we know what actually happened but over these two hours we do get a sense of beginning to know a little of the man beneath the crown and of his honest and forthright advisor and of why they might have become firm friends.

Just not very good,"I admit I am in a minority, my friends liked it, but I found it a plodding, pedestrian and predictable story. Geoffrey Rush played his part well. Helena Bonham-Carter and historic Brtain looked nice, and I liked the shots of the radio broadcasting cabinets with all the country names on them. That's about it. I was totally uninspired by the climatic speech which sounded wooden and stilted. Maybe I just don't sympathise enough with the hardship of being in the Royal Family. I enjoy history, and my opinion of the film only sank further when I found out how historically inaccurate and misleading it is at parts. I can't be bothered to look further or describe that. The one thing I did agree with friends on was that it didn't feel like a 2 hour film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A royal speech lesson,"Most historians seem to agree that since that minor German princeling George of Hanover was placed on the throne of the United Kingdom for no better reason that he was a protestant great-grandchild of James I, the throne has been occupied by, well, dullards. These have been of two sorts; the flamboyant as personified by George IV, Edward VII and Edward VIII, and the dutiful, such as Victoria, George V and the present incumbent. The subject of this film, her father Bertie, was definitely of the dutiful sort, but it was a duty he thought he was spared for until his air-head of an older brother fell for the charms of the twice divorced American social adventuress Wallis Simpson and renounced the throne to marry her. For poor Bertie has a serious stutter, and while the British Monarchy is expected to do nothing in particular it is expected to do it rather well.The film tells how an uncredentialed but very experienced Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), helped Bertie, later George VI (Colin Firth), overcome his speech problem. Some liberty is taken with the facts to orchestrate a dramatic build-up to the fine speech Bertie gave as king on the outbreak of World War II in 1939 (by then Logue's therapy over 12 years had considerably improved things), but the scriptwriters, who had access to Logue's diaries, are able to re-create the singular relationship that developed between two men of contrasting backgrounds. Some of Logue's methodology is still a bit shadowy but whatever he got his patients to do, it mostly worked. Logue was convinced the root cause of stutters and stammers was psychological, and given that bullying was an integral part of a English ""public"" school upbringing it wasn't hard to see the causes. However he struck trouble with Bertie, who was not about to let Logue loose in his psychohistory. Eventually, Logue prevails, but we also have to hand it to Bertie as well. Old George V (Michael Gambon) was right about one thing, Bertie might not have been the sharpest knife in the palace kitchen but he was blessed with great perseverance.Actually, it's hard to fault this film. The minor characters are a delight, but the two leads are terrific. Rush is utterly convincing as the slightly raffish ex-amateur actor turned therapist while Firth, always good as agonisied characters, excels himself as the battling Bertie. If anyone is going to get an academy award, it should be the two of them, jointly. Helena Bonham Carter as Bertie's bright and loving consort also merits a mention. Apparently the Queen Mother (as she later became) found the memories of Bertie's speech struggles too painful to revisit in her lifetime, but she would not have been too unhappy with the result here.The British royal family has been the subject of some quite decent films in recent years, ""The Queen"" (about Elizabeth II and Diana's death) and ""Mrs Brown"" (about Queen Victoria and her Scottish gillie), and this would have to rank as one of the better ones, though as usual the film makers have been locked out of the actual royal locations.. Curing speech defects normally would not give rise to much drama, but in this particular case there is an undeniable connection with great events. It is impossible to say how much effect George VI's speeches had on the British war effort and many would say Churchill (played here with great panache by Timothy Spall, who has the great man's voice off perfectly) was more influential. But it's safe to say neither did much harm.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Colin Firth gives the best performance of his career as King George VI - This is storytelling and filmmaking at its best,"The King's Speech is a historical drama where Colin Firth plays the future King George VI who, to cope with a stammer, sees Lionel Logue, an Australian speech and language therapist played by Geoffrey Rush. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother abdicates the throne, the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast upon Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939. Some others in the main cast are Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth, Guy Pearce as King Edward VIII, Michael Gambon as King George V and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. The film is directed by Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler, whom had read about George VI's life after learning to manage a stuttering condition he developed during his own youth. He started writing about the relationship between the therapist and his royal patient as early as the 1980s, but at the request of the King's widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, postponed work until her death in 2002. Then David Seidler rewrote it as a screenplay, so this is a passionate project of his and with Tom Hooper in the director chair, his passion project turned into an incredible and beautifully made film.The acting is truly astonishing in this film, Colin Firth won an academy award for the performance and rightfully so. Firth did a huge amount of research into the role and also worked with Neil Swain, the voice coach for the film, in developing his portrayal of George VI's stammer. Every single part of his performance is brilliant, he seriously gave the best performance of his career. Geoffrey Rush's performance as Lionel Logue was another highlight, bringing life to the character. The friendship the two made in the film and in real life is truly fantastic and made for a great story, the chemistry between the two leads are a huge reason why it worked so well. You see it in their eyes how much they care for each other, that is what I call acting.The King's Speech was widely praised by film critics for its visual style, art direction, screenplay, directing, score, and acting. I can only agree, it's a masterpiece. The representation of historical detail is also at a high and you notice how the people who worked for the movie care for its historical authenticity. The King's Speech received many awards and nominations, particularly for Colin Firth's performance, which resulted in his first Oscar win for Best Actor. The film received 12 Oscar nominations and won four, including Best Picture.I found every second of The King's Speech to be fantastic and truly inspiring. This film sadly fell under my radar when it was released, but watching The Crown helped me gain the interest needed to watch this remarkable film and my honest opinion, a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Always hated Colin Firth BUT...,"This movie is OUTSTANDING. And so is Colin Firth, I freely admit! The film I saw previous to The King's Speech was Tron Legacy, and this movie had more tension in the first two minutes than Tron had in its entirety. And after that, The King's Speech just gets better and better. If anyone had told me that a movie about a guy stammering could be this good, I would never have believed them. Seriously - you have to see it with your own eyes, because it sounds pretty lousy. Colin Firth is astonishing, but every other part is played to perfection and Geoffrey Rush is superb.Moving, funny, dramatic and compelling throughout. Deserves every award it picks up and - for once - the huge score it's getting on IMDb.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Moving Character Story,"A wonderful film that shows the internal and external struggles of the King.

Two incredible performances,"This movie starts in 1925 as King George directs his second son, the future King George VI (Colin Firth), to deliver a speech on the radio. He stutters his way through an embarrassing effort. It's a struggle with various bad teachers. His only support is his wife (Helena Bonham Carter). She finds unorthodox speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) surreptitiously without her husband's approval. He is more than very reluctant. He slowly develops a friendship with the amateur actor Lionel. Meanwhile his older brother King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce) is dating Wallis Simpson (Eve Best) culminating in his abdication and the installation of George as the new king.This is an actors' movie. Both Firth and Rush are doing award worthy performances. They have created real flesh and blood human beings and not just some stuffy royal and his Professor Higgins. They have real feelings and fears. The fear in George is palpable. They have great interactions together especially early on. The movie does have a few slow spots in the middle but it's still one of the best of that year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
It's all in the handling.,"An impressive picture, given that its based around almost no stakes at all. I mean, I'm not saying a speech impediment isn't a real challenge to live with for a couple of reasons but really, he's royalty, i'm not going to feel that sorry.It is Firth's immensely sympathetic performance of a repressed and slightly neurotic individual that gives this the kick it needs, forming a superb double act with the failed actor finding a purpose in helping another who needs the help only he can give (apparently).Pretty sweet and often fairly funny, it's Bonham Carter doesn't have too big a part thank goodness (I'm getting pretty sick of her), and also a bit marred by its desperation to make out Edward VIII as a villian whose desire to marry for love was some kind of betrayal.The depiction of the royals as humans is what makes this truly a treat. The toxic Michael Gambom as George V juxtaposed to the wonderful tenderness that Bertie has with his Family.But I am going to say this: he didn't have to become King. He chose that. And it's not like he saw any fighting so it's not like he lost much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Point of Purpose,"Colin Firth yelling ""I have a voice"" elucidates the power of thought, opinion and conviction. It also sums up the courage taken by King George VI to simply conjoined and deliver a message through the art of the spoken word. For Firth's character though, King George VI, such an action cannot be looked at as an art, but as an impediment that can only be accomplished in the most trying and basic of steps.The King's Speech so smoothly nails down the basics, while incorporating a warm exuding spirit. It includes suiting complimentary performances from Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter as well as a slightly more than cameo role for Guy Pearce. This is the breakout film for director Tom Hooper, who has directed HBO miniseries such as John Adams and Elizabeth I. It is also the most notable screenplay written by David Seidler to date.Although The King's Speech is not a revolutionary film by any stretch, it is one delivered by way of experience, maturation and a point of purpose.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"A good character study and phenomenal performance by Firth, but a dull, predictable story arc lacking energy","The King's Speech, while fascinating as a true story and a pretty effective character study, falls short as an engaging narrative. Firth is the bright spot that creates all the success the movie attains. The emotion you see on his face as he struggles with his stammer, his anger in private, and his developing confidence was great to watch, and making the stammer believable is a very difficult task he pulls off with flying colors. Unfortunately, the movie's other elements aren't so rosy. The character study works early on in showing what caused his stammer and various factors that exacerbate it. It's an interesting story of overcoming fear, but in the second half of the movie I felt the character focus lessen. I would've liked to see more of what really makes him more confident, going deeper than just a couple of the exercises like dancing, singing, or cursing, because his character journey is much deeper than that. The broader narrative was extremely obvious and predictable, which sucked any tension out of the film. With the exception of a few interactions in sessions, most of the movie was a fairly dull slog because it was apparent what George's struggles are and the arc he'll take to overcome them. The climax felt particularly strange, partially because it felt like a foregone conclusion, but mostly because the content of his speech seemed like a side note while we were really just watching to see how he manages his stammer. I could make minor quibbles in how narrow his circle of friends, advisors, and colleagues was for such an important figure (and as a result are exposed to just three characters), but it didn't take me out of the story. It's a fine movie saved by Firth, but the plot leaves a lot of intrigue and enjoyment on the table.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"A fantastic, moving film; easily one of the year's best","This review will not do the film justice, I mean, all I'm going to do is praise everything about the movie but how many of you are actually going to go out and see it based on my recommendation? Well, hopefully the following may convince some of you! Based on the true story of King George VI's journey to overcome his speech impediment, Tom Hooper's The King's Speech succeeds at being one of the best films of the last decade. Every aspect of the movie is perfect, and is combined to create a rare cinematic treat, a movie that combines genuine comedy with an inspiring story of perseverance through the hardest of times. I have read some interesting posts on the message board that state it's hard to form a connection between King George VI and his problem due to the fact he is royalty and it's 'merely a speech impediment.' To me, this is totally wrong, I felt for the King throughout the movie, and the film showed that despite the fact George was the King he faced many personal problems.The wonderful story is undeniably made better by the extraordinary cast. Colin Firth, who was excellent in A Single Man, once again puts in an amazing performance as King George VI. He is quite simply phenomenal in every aspect, perfectly projecting the Duke's (and soon to be King) insecurities and bottled secrets. He is wonderfully supported by Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth, who is simply stunning. She provides the Duke with loving support as he attempts to overcome his disability, helping him every step of the way. Finally, Geoffrey Rush portrays Lionel Logue, the Australian (from my home city Adelaide!) speech therapist who sets out to cure King George's stutter. Rush is simply superb, he injects an incredible sense of humour into the story, and he simply dives into his role. It is almost as if he is not acting, he is incredibly real, and again proves he is one of the greatest actors of all time.Along with the acting, all other aspects are fantastic. The 30's is re-created realistically, with excellent sets and costume design. The score is fantastic, and in the final scene gives the event that takes place that much more emotion. Hooper's direction is perfect, every scene is shot with such purpose, there are no filler scenes, no sappy, manipulative scenes which force the viewer to feel sorry or angry, he just lets camera roll and the actors do their thing.Not much else can be said, apart from the fact that this film deserves to be seen by anyone who considers themselves a film buff. The King's Speech encompasses everything that I love about the movies; acting, direction, story, score, emotion. Don't miss the chance to see this, it is a truly wonderful film.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Informative, entertaining, uplifting, memorable","Stars Colin Firth (as Bertie/King George VI), Helena Bonham Carter (as his wife), Geoffrey Rush (as Lionel Logue, his speech therapist), Guy Pearce (as his older brother, David/King Edward VIII/Duke of Windsor).The narrative imagines the private and public lives of British royalty and behind the scenes British government in the 1920s-1940s era. Some events and situations are public knowledge: that King George V died, that he was briefly followed by his eldest son ('David,' Edward VIII) who then abdicated within a year to marry a divorced American commoner, Wallis Simpson, ""the woman I love,"" who was then succeeded by his next younger brother, Bertie/George VI, who had long standing speech problems (stuttering/stammering). And that an Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue, helped him largely overcome that to the extent the King was able to effectively address his empire through the trying times of WW II.The movie takes some relatively minor (IMO) liberties with historical accuracy for the sake of spinning a more interesting story. It imagines and presumes much of the private lives and motivations of the royal family and presents them sympathetically. The growing wedge between Bertie (+ the rest of the royal family and government) and David uses little imagination and many known facts.The success of Logue's speech therapy is very clear from pre- and post-treatment newsreels of that era. BUT that it was achieved by Logue being so provocatively teasing and taunting of Bertie seems to have been wholly invented in this movie to spice up and dramatize their therapy relationship; e.g., it's not in Logue's grandson's book about Logue and his relationship with the royal family (based on Logue's own notes!)--or any other reports about their relationship I've seen.But, that aside, TKS is a great movie, weaving together history, crisis, family, the slow development of an effective therapeutic relationship and the growth it fostered. Many people describe the film as being very uplifting and I agree.Surely it's a very strong candidate for best picture (& best actor & best supporting actor) in this year's Oscars as well as very deserving of a lasting place among IMDb's all-time best 250 films ever, even without a single chase, sex, or battle scene--or the spilling of blood!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Strangely underwhelming idea, executed with grace and power","You wouldn't think that a movie about a man trying to overcome his stuttering problem would amount to much anything, but when you add in the fact that the man in question is King George VI of Britain and that the movie takes place just before and during the early stages of World War II, well, then you have a powerful drama in the making.Not that a movie about just a man with a speech impairment couldn't have been good, but the historical background does add to the movie's charm in this case, in my opinion. The fact that the king needs to be able to make speeches in order to lead his country raises stakes and makes the learning process more than just a personal struggle. The fact that this is based on a true story also adds that final touch of realism, which is clearly present in the film as a whole. The film feels like this really could have happened, and to a degree it did. Apparently the film makers did take some liberties with the timeline and the small details, but in this case all these changes were done for a reason and at least I don't blame them. This film is done with professionalism, care and personal love for the subject matter and it shows. Excellent film making all around.Nevertheless, the quality of a drama film is often decided by the main actors, and this is no exception. This film needed charismatic and, above all, convincing actors to play King George and Lionel Logue. Fortunately Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush more than rose up to the occasion, giving brilliant performances and easily convincing us that they are the real deal. Firth especially was amazing, I cannot praise his performance enough. His soul, his struggling, his quiet dignity and determination.Props for Helena Bonham Carter as well. Always a favourite of mine.This is a film that all lovers of historical drama should see. The story is extremely powerful. It invests you into the lives of its characters and when things finally start to work out for our dear king, you cannot help but smile proudly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Marvelous cinema...,"In 1936 Britain--after his father, King George V, dies and his brother, Edward, renounces the throne in order to marry a two-time divorcée--Prince Albert, Duke of York must assume the royal duties during a turbulent time in world history, which includes giving a unifying speech to all the country over the wireless. Albert's biggest worry, however, is just getting through that nine-minute speech without his usual stammer, which has daunted him since he was a child. Impeccably-performed, emotional and entertaining bit of history concentrates on character instead of textbook events (which, in this case--and with this cast--is a plus). Colin Firth deservedly won the Best Actor Oscar for his amazing work in the lead, though Geoffrey Rush (who also served as executive producer) is every bit as good portraying Albert's unorthodox speech therapist. The film is a bit isolated from the world outside; we get a glimpse of a coronation (and also of Hitler) in a newsreel clip, but there's not much on the working classes--which tends to lessen the overall impact of the finale. Still, it's a feel-good movie, presented with heart (thanks to the actors) and sincerity. The uplift one gets from it doesn't dim the biographical context, nor does the scenario feel Hollywoodized. This is one classy picture, which also nabbed Oscars for Best Film, David Seidler for his original screenplay, and Tom Hooper for his direction. ***1/2 from ****",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Great View of a Lesser Known Period in England,"This is the wonderful story of the efforts by an unconventional speech teacher and a monarch. George VI grows up in a period where it mattered internationally what a king would say and how he said it. It was necessary for the people of Britain to have faith because they were in great need of substantiation, having to make a speech of great importance. Enter Lionel Logue, played by the inimitable Geoffrey Rush. He pulls himself from the sycophantic ineffectiveness of others and attacks the inabilities to deliver a speech by using unconventional, earthy methods to get the King to do his thing. I don't know if it happened that way. I'm hoping it did. But it's a great story.

I have to admit, my expectations were sky-high and it didn't live up to that hype, but I still enjoyed it though.

Engrossing if not perfect,"I expected to be bored by parts of this movie but wasn't. It's just a speech impediment but they managed to make it moving. You feel for the King and what his burden and duty was. The historical events surrounding are nicely added in like the abdication and coming war.The acting is competent. Colin Firth does a good job as the belligerent but well intentioned king. His stammer is well done not annoying and spontaneous looking. His outbursts may have been a bit overdone and coarse for a King - perhaps for dramatic effect. Helena Bonham as the Queen is more likable not her usual over the top self. Geoffrey Rush is fascinating to watch. The pace and screenplay are good. Guy Pearce was a bit out of place as the Prince of Wales - not aristocratic enough. The actress playing Wallis wasn't ugly enough.A couple of faults. It would have been better to speed up the earlier part of the movie and cover a much longer time period through WWII to show the importance of speeches during the dark days of the war. The score was wrong. Using music of the German composer Beethoven, in a movie about England entering into war with Germany was a wrong choice.

Painfully Bland And As Exciting As Watching Paint Dry,"I started watching it because of its reputation and its cast.

It's as if the budget allowed the set and costume designers to use only blue, black, and brown with a sprinkling of white.And, like other reviewers have commented, the performances were disappointing.I got the impression that whoever approved the production of this film thought that because ""Downton Abbey"" was a hit, anything that is about the British aristocracy or monarchy would be one as well.

What a film should be,"[5 Stars] If the basic aim of any film review is to tell the reader whether or not to go and spend their money on a film, let me fulfil that now: go and see this film, because it is almost the very definition of your money's worth. Director Tom Hooper has delivered a witty, engrossing, moving and thrilling film, driven by an excellent script from David Seidler and an exemplary cast, led by two terrific performances from Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush.The story of George VI, one of Britain's finest modern monarchs, and his struggle with his stammer has usually been a footnote in the history of the 20th century, swept aside by the tempest and tumult of the Second World War and the defeat of the Nazis. However, this film finds the deeply human story of the man who had been bullied by many crucial figures in his childhood and had developed a stammer, and found himself in the unwanted position of voice of a nation at the time of its greatest trial.Firth is quite magnificent. Whilst Rush's Lionel Logue (the controversial speech therapist) has many of the best lines and is utterly charming, it is the power of Firth's subtle performance which makes the film so gripping. Far beyond the perfect representation of a stammerer that he delivers, one is with Firth's ""Bertie"" all the way, delighting in his charming story-telling with his children, and weeping with him as he discloses the surprising harshness of his childhood.All of this builds and swells, never once dropping pace or losing the audience's interest. The final speech is utterly thrilling and spine-tingling, the perfect climax of a film which has made you laugh, cry and told a quite wonderful and inspiring story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

True Friendship,"During his coronation rehearsal Colin Firth's King George VI screams, ""I have a voice!"" His speech coach Lionel Logue played by Geoffrey Rush quietly responds, ""Yes, you do."" ""King's Speech"" is the best movie of the year. ""King's Speech"" is absolutely inspiring and touching. Firth and Rush have an amazing and moving partnership. Based on the true story of King George VI of England before World War II, when he became king after his brother King Edward was forced to abdicate the throne when he chooses to marry twice divorced American Wallis Simpson—forbade by the Church of England. King George suffers debilitating stammering speech. Paradoxically, Screenwriter Danny Cohen's words are inspired eloquence. Tom Hooper's direction is powerful and resonates with a tangible authenticity.""King's Speech"" is about overcoming the fear of and reclaiming one's greatness. In a heartbreaking scene in the King's den, George (Firth) weeps to his very soul, ""I'm not a king! I'm not a king!"" If you replace the word ""king"" with ""great"", I think you get the profound transformation at play. Everyone has a fear of sucking or looking bad. Perhaps, the most profound fear for everyone is actually being great. Lionel's wife Myrtle (understanding Jennifer Ehle) inquires about his melancholy. He says it is about his client— secretly George. ""He can be great."" But George doesn't know that. Lionel has a telling conversation with Berty (his personal address for George); he asks him, ""What are you so fearful of?""Berty is afraid of becoming King—he is afraid of being great. As ""King's Speech"" opens we painfully witness Berty (Firth) stammer through a public speaking engagement. He is the second son of King George V (gently intolerant Michael Gambon), so not directly in line to the Throne. Firth embodies Berty's decency and enlightened self awareness. Following the embarrassing Christmas radio speech, Berty and his devoted wife Elizabeth (strong and compassionate Helena Bonham Carter) approach heretic speech coach Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to correct this tragic flaw.Lionel is discounted on two levels: he is Australian, and is a failed stage actor without legitimate credentials. Berty assumes that Lionel is a Doctor. During the initial consult, Lionel discerns that Berty's stammering is nothing mechanical. At cause are his relationships with his Father King George V (Gambon) and future king brother Edward (elusive and charming Guy Pearce). Demonstrating his family loyalty to George V, his overbearing father never acknowledges him. Pearce brilliantly captures Edward as well intentioned, but completely irresponsible playboy. Although he loves his brother Berty, Edward mocks his solid and brave kid brother.England is on the verge of War with Germany, and King George V is deathly ailing. Aside from Elizabeth, Lionel truly sees Berty, the man is; the man can be. Rush confides to Berty (Firth), ""You are the most courageous man I know..."" Berty never had any friends, much less Commoners. ""King's Speech"" indelibly tells the touching story of a lifelong friendship and partnership. Colin Firth is compellingly vulnerable, and powerful. He will win an Oscar for Best Actor. Geoffrey Rush is electrifying in his compassion and unwavering belief in his friend. Their screen partnership is amazing. In the astounding story arc, Rush tells Firth to deliver the speech to him, as he would talk to his friend. That touched me profoundly.I have worked on my public speaking, not training nearly as hard as Berty, although forcing me to alter myself. Once while struggling through a practice speech with my dear friend and mentor John, he told me, ""Talk to me as your friend."" I got it. The cinematography, costume design, and music are impeccable in ""King's Speech"". I think the true power of ""King's Speech"" is the story of profound love and lifelong friendship. True heroes see the greatness in others, and fulfill on that promise. ""King's Speech"" is the best movie of the year that fulfills on this promise for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Solid biopic about King George VI,"Calm, soberly told and dialog-heavy biopic about the stuttering King George VI and his speech correctionist, which nevertheless knows how to sweep its audience away in a few moments. The top-class cast (including Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham-Carter, Michael Gambon) has a large part in this, from which, in addition to the Oscar-winning Firth, Rush ('Pirates of the Caribbean') stands out. Also worth mentioning is Derek Jacobi, who plays the devoted Archbishop Cosmo Lang as well as Bonham-Carter as a lively ""Queen Mum"" Elizabeth. Criticisms are the relatively long playing time of 119 minutes for the manageable plot as well as some historic inaccuracies.Genre rating (biopic/historical drama): 8/10 Overall rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The King's Speech (2010),"It's certainly Oscar-bait. It involves a monarch, trying to overcome a difficult situation, and turning to a commoner to bring hope to the nation. Fortunately, The King's Speech is also a bloody well made film. Firth continues on his acting road of perfection. It can't be easy to present a speech impediment, without it sounding forced. Firth slides so naturally into the role that he perfectly jumps from the stammering wreck, to the shouty, sweary, clear voiced monarch. The film also examines the power of speech. It shows how it can bring hope, but also, in my favorite scene, how it can control (Hitler). We also see a monarchy that examines its place in society, as Firth acknowledges he can't form a government or declare war, and Gambon notes that a King just had to look good before the advent of radio. It is feel good, but that feel good is also laced with a bit of irony, as the final hurdle sees a King just trying not to stammer as he addresses the nation about a war just entered. A wonderful film that, despite being about speech, also uses many visual techniques to explore its subject.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Well Done Weinsteins...,"... Not for producing The Kings Speach - for the amazing amount of successful lobbying that must have taken place behind the scenes in order to be awarded a fistful of BAFTAs and Oscars.Fair to say, judging by many of the reviews on IMDb and the high MetaScore, there are many that appreciated. Tom Hoopers work.Just a footnote to, the apparently few, that found the end result a ""little flat"" and disturbingly close to formula filmmaking - you are not alone.Neither are you alone if you consider The Kings Speach; a reasonable watch on a rainy afternoon - but void of anything that could be regarded as cinematic greatness.Congratulations to the rest of you - it's way more rewarding to experience greatness than to feel that you are missing out.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Colin Firth's jowls steal the spotlight, but it's a jolly well good movie too","Probably the strongest asset to The King's Speech, which could have been a dry period piece examining the problem of the stutter that King George (aka Prince Albert) had to overcome with his Australian speech therapist, is brought to life with conviction due to good acting and some creative direction from Tom Hooper. There's also some other interest with some of the machinations of the King-hood, how he interacts with the Church of England (being, y'know, the head of the Church) and George's brother who actually steps down as the King after their father dies due to his philandering and wanting to marry a divorced American woman. But you don't go to see The King's Speech for Colin Firth playing the Duke of York with that impediment that he's had since 4 or 5 and Geoggrey Rush as his therapist who is never not helpful and is also helpfully critical with his decisions, even if George doesn't like some of his comments. He's the Duke of York after all; they're not very used to things like criticism. And especially not the stuttering 'Bertie' who used to be called B-b-b-b-Bertie as a kid.Stuttering is also the kind of impediment that combined with a regal story of power changing hands at the door of WW2 that could probably get Firth the Oscar. Not only that, but Firth is just that damn good here; for the kind of performance that one could dub ""Oscar bait"" (that is the kind of movie or performance that is giving it over to the Academy on a silver platter), it's much more human and sympathetic than I expected. He often looks like he's about to mope any moment in the movie, but what mope! And George's temper makes it interesting as well: George not only has to overcome the stammer, but his own low self-esteem brought on by years of verbal abuse from his father George V and his snide s*** of a brother. If not for the introduction to Lionel or the support of his wife Elizabeth he might be found compulsively cowering in the corner of Buckingham Palace. Firth makes that fear believable, and the desire, genuinely, from the audience that he should get better, or come closer to it.One of things that I did like is how by the climax of the film, when George, now the King (this isn't a spoiler, folks, this is bloody history, look it up), has to give the speech to England in 1939 on the cusp of going to war with Germany, he's still not quite confidant. And he only just gets by in the speech, yet he makes it believable as it should be to a Nation, nay a world, to hear him out. The confidence factor is what counts, and I liked that that was what was at stake even more than the stammer. That Firth has such a good co-star with Rush, who can play friendly-pushy and blunt very well is a big plus; that's another thing separating this from another stuffy English Royalty piece, the humor. The lines are witty enough to get someone who can be tired of trying-to-be-witty British humor excited and taking notice of my own laughter. Especially during the swearing scene, which was unfairly what made the film R rated in the US, and with off-handed comments all the way up to and including dramatic confrontations like when George talks to Lionel about his credentials in the royal coronation room.If nothing else the two actors have such good friendly chemistry I could recommend the movie on that basis alone. But it's also a jolly-good period piece that is inviting for a modern audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The best film I have seen in ages!!!!,"Having read a few reviews regarding the film of the moment 'The Kings Speech', I went to my local cinema to see it today. Not quite sure what I was letting myself in for really, as most of the audience was of a certain age but none the less we all sat there with intrigue and anticipation waiting for the film to start. Not sure what it was that took over my thoughts and desires but I was in desperate need to see this film. From the moment it started I was mesmerized. I was trans-fixed on the screen. The film is filled with moments of sadness, frustration and humour all of which I felt whilst watching the movie. The actors are BRILLIANT, every single one of them. Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter were amazing. I have even seen Timothy Spall in a new light, although he had a small part- very good indeed. Although I was not born in that era, I certainly felt as if I was there especially seeing what London would have been like at that time. At the end of the movie, all I could hear was members of the audience commenting on how good the film was. It seemed everyone was satsified.Cant wait for the DVD to be released, may even go to the cinema and see it again. As I have said the best film I have seen for some time and is truly brilliant. I came away feeling satisifed that I have spent money on ever increasing cinema fees and had the most wonderful time. I feel the cast and crew have done the UK proud in this movie and would be keen to know what the Royal Family think about it. If it does not sweep the awards ceremonies then I would be shocked and devastated. Everyone must see this movie. It is BRILLIANT BRILLIANT BRILLIANT, love it, love it, love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
All Hail The King,"Giving a public speech has always be a difficult thing to do for most of the people. Not everyone could deliver it well. you could simply change your job if it doesn't suit you. But it will not be that simple when you are a King. King George VI is the father of Queen Elizabeth II. Thiz is the story about the early years of his reign in 1920-1940s. For his difficulty of public speaking, to heal his stammer, he hires an Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) and learns it through some unorthodox techniques. Later, in addition to that process they bound to some manhood relationships and find greater meaning of life. The movie is directed by Tom Hooper who is known before for a movie about the famous football club Leeds United in ""The Damned United"" (2009). In thiz film, he applies many unusual styles. The cinematography is very interesting. In one moment he puts the face of the characters precise in the middle of the screen, leaving significant unusual distance. In another moment, he puts the object precisely in the lower left of the screen. Most of the times, everything looks even different, he provides three dimensional view with his concave perspective. It is eccentric but works quite well. Those techniques emphasize the honesty and integrity through its story-telling. But the element that makes thiz movie works really well, it's Colin Firth who transforms his body and soul to be Duke of York or better known as King George VI. I could feel his effort and weakness clearly in his complex character. No doubt is one of Firth's best performances of all-time. The other great role that deserves to be mentioned is Helena Bonham Carter as his wife Queen Elizabeth. Thiz is one of the rare times I find that she could be so normal, after her previous roles that were mostly Gothic. Guy Pearce is quite convincing too as his older brother who is forced to abdicate, Edward VIII. The small but interesting role also comes from Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. Last time, the Director Tom Hooper lifted incredible story about football, he didn't get much attention although it was a great movie as well. Now with the same quality of work, plus extraordinary performance from Colin Firth, he surely will get more attention than before. That's the difference when you take the story between football and real monarchy. It needs a great speech to be a great leader, but it needs a great heart to be a great King.Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
That's how movies should be made!,"Movie-making at its finest! The King's Speech shows that it is not the great story or the great characters that make a movie worth watching... it is all about how this movie is made.King George VI was a stammer. A trivial fact that you might come across in history books. To build up a motivational and heart-wrenching story based on this very simple piece of information that you will probably pass by and take slightly in any other occasion is absolute brilliance! The King's Speech is not about a speech or a stuttering king, it is about finding the courage in each one of us through making peace with our fears and tolerating our shortcomings.The movie was touching, witty (thanks to the unbelievably beautiful script) and sometimes incredibly funny! The performance was epic. Geoffrey Rush was adorable as usual as the king's speech therapist. Guy Pearce deserves an applause for his small, yet eye-catching role as King George's flamboyant brother. As for Colin Firth, I used to love the guy.. but now I love him even more and more. A lifetime, unforgettable performance by the extremely talented and very decent Mr. Firth. He certainly deserves every ounce of gold in the Oscar he grabbed for this role.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A good period piece,"Tbe king finds his voice (The Kings Speech)is a feel good movie about a man who finds his voice and along the way finds the strength to be king. The movies plot is King George VI(Colin Firth)has a speech impediment and his wife(Helena Bonham Carter) seeks help from Lionel Logue(Geoffrey Rush)who takes on the case. The story tells how he becomes king and finally finds his voice to lead the realm into war.The film looks good and much detail is made to make it feel like the 1930's the acting is top notch especially Geoffrey Rush's part. the downside is that the subject material is just not all that exciting, to me the movie comes across something I would see on Masterpiece theatric/Grade C-",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Splendid film where everything worked together... and well,"Watch out, Oscars: ""The Social Network"" has found its rival.""The King's Speech"" is an historic drama about King George VI and his attempts to get rid of his stutter, because how can a world leader, let alone one on the brink of war, lead a country without speaking properly? The film focuses on the methods that the King has to go through, set up by speech therapist Lionel Logue, and eventually a strong bond forms between them.Let me just start out by saying that Colin Firth is magnificent as the King and he is rightfully and thankfully winning all of the Best Actor awards right now because of this performance. Firth has always been an interesting actor who shows a lot of talent but showcases it in full here. His eyes and mannerisms display a variety of emotions from conflict to aggression and solemnity. It is a superb and memorable performance. Geoffrey Rush is also very strong as Logue and he excludes a classy aura around him while also giving a nuanced, witty performance. The chemistry between Firth and Rush is fantastic and the film is theirs with their presence alone. But let's not forget Helena Bonham Carter, who is the emotional core of the King, as she also exudes some care and affection towards the King in his time of need.The screenplay is masterfully written by David Siedler, full of sly British humor and wit, but not overly done to sacrifice the story and characters. The dialogue is fantastic, made even more great by the brilliant performances and extremely focused direction by Tom Hooper. The production design is beautiful with some nice outdoor locations and interiors of the British monarchy, the cinematography is perfectly framed with the faces of the actors treated like landscapes to get every emotion out of them, and the music by Alexandre Desplat is classy and exudes many emotions from liveliness to solemnity to finally grand.Two things I would like to add. One, is that everything, and I mean EVERYTHING in this movie worked. Because they all help each other out. The acting is made better by the screenplay and direction, which is also helped by the cinematography and music. All of these forces combine to craft one brilliant scene after another, transforming a simple story to a film worth watching many times to learn about friendship and perseverance.Secondly, the cinematography is quite unique: usually the camera will frame the actor looking to his right, on the right side of the screen; in this movie it is inverted, creating an unusual but effective method of capturing the actors' faces.Overall, I really can't say enough praise for this film, because it is a simple story that is magnificently and professionally told by a cast and crew that moves like clockwork and performs perfectly like a well-staged play. Kudos to everyone involved, and congratulations at the BAFTAs for hard work that is well-rewarded.Now come the Oscars to see which is truly the better film, for I am, for the first time, at a loss to see which movie will win, the Facebook movie, or the stuttering King? We shall see.Overall rating: 94/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Unoriginal, contrived, self-satisfied junk","The simple, totally bland film that literally revolves around the speech impediment of a historically unimportant royal (why are we supposed to care?) suffocates under its nonstop ""crowd-pleasing"" clichés. This film is made up of insufferably self-satisfied acting, direction, and writing (you can just imagine all involved patting themselves on the back for being clever). The one-liners are so manufactured and unoriginal that it should have had a laugh track. The whole thing is so uninspiring and devoid of any real emotion, substance, or originality that I'm honestly stunned at the reception it received upon its release.None of the performances rise above the ingratiating material; in fact, they are accomplices. It tries to lend gravity to the proceedings by sprinkling historical events (the rise of Hitler, the beginning of WWII) throughout in the most amateurish way possible.

I was impressed by both the male actor leads. They conveyed so much without words. I was amazed when the very responsive audience laughed at humorous parts of the movie when just slight changes in expression by Geoffrey Rush or Colin Firth conveyed this. They didn't overact at all. It was subtle, but everyone in the audience 'got it.' I was also blown away by how luminously beautiful Helen Bonham Carter was in the movie. How old is she? Didn't she play an ape in the last movie I saw her in? She's gotten younger while I've gotten older! I'll look forward to the Oscars this year to see how many this movie takes.

good relationship,"I was surprised that there is a king who does not like a speech in the king of the British Empire. The film depicts the struggle of his.

The Figure that the king is trying to overcome suffering with a complex invites sympathy. I would like to send a yell for the king. Face with a feature of Geoffrey Rush is matched to the dubious therapist role unqualified. In the speech scene of George VI, Colin Firth is a great performance indeed. When he is giving a speech, the line of sight of the audience pierce, eyes swimming, breathing becomes shallow, face stiffness, he stuffy more he going to talk well, the following words does not come out.

I can't believe these guys won me over so easily,"First hurdle, this is about royalty. I've spent way too much time fighting boneheads who think they're America's new aristocracy to feel predisposed toward this institution. Second hurdle, this is an English period piece. I'm not fond of having to strain to listen to people who seem all too enamored of themselves in order to make out what they're saying through their oh so British accents. Third hurdle, there's little or no action or intrigue in the storyline, just a man, his therapist and his struggle to overcome one of the most pitiful ailments there are. It promised to be something like an updated Miracle Worker but without Patty Duke.I've been so completely reversed it's awe inspiring. I can't think of one aspect of this film that isn't superb in a way that I haven't seen done in years. The sets and staging of scenes alone is worth the price of admission.

The King speaks!,"Set during the years leading to the onset of World War 2, The King's Speech tells the gloriously motivating story of King George VI's ascension to the throne with the help of a common man.Directed masterfully by Tom Hooper(John Adams) this amazingly unbridled tale of a man thrust into regality only to realize a sense of trepidation and low-self esteem with every step he takes , is laced with inspirational valor and perseverance.The movie starts off with a visibly trembling Prince Albert about to give a speech to a crowd only to stammer and awkwardly fumble through his speech.After having seen a slew of certified(and apparently Knighted) speech therapists the Prince just sees a drastic declination in his ability to counter his impediment.This begins to change when his wife(soon to be Queen Elizabeth) seeks the help of Lionel Logue, a speech therapist who prides in his infallible and unorthodox ways to help people with their speech defects.Although assertively reluctant in the beginning, Albert slowly gives in to his useful methodology and finds a helpful savior and a de-facto friend in Logue.Although there relationship is defined as being volatile and teetering on uneasiness, there alliance helps the would be King to find his mark and with lovable support from his wife, begins his monumental rise to royal power.Now, with the performances.Firth's portrayal of the perpetually embittered Prince is just one of the best you'll ever see.The way how he manages to essay the role of a man with anger issues(although the near-perfect epitome of a loving husband/father), unresolved inhibitions and his bid to subvert the somewhat nefarious and aberrant intentions of his older brother is just awe-inducing.One of the best underrated actors out there(was only fairly recognized after ""A Single Man"") Firth churns out an amazing performance.The movie's also girded with fairly decent performances by Rush and Bonham Carter. Watching Rush play his role with relative ease is a treat.His audacious mannerisms(He calls Albert 'Bertie' on their first meeting) and resolute willingness to help Albert is award worthy.While Firth almost remains poised for a much needed Oscar glory(Jeff Bridges' turn in True Grit might eclipse him), the movie is almost certain to snag Best picture, direction, original screenplay and probably a best supporting actor nomination at the Oscars.Do give it a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A kingly performance,"Playing the stammering King George VI would seem to be an incredible challenge for an actor. Colin Firth proves more than up to the task, turning in a quite remarkable performance. King George, or Prince Albert as he was at the start of this film, had no voice. Words remained hopelessly stuck in his throat, a tremendous problem for a royal who in the new modern age of radio would be heard by an entire empire. When that microphone turns on there is nowhere for Albert to hide. Perhaps a lesser royal could withdraw, lead a quiet life of solitude. A king does not have this option. He was never supposed to be king but when his brother gives up the throne Albert is front and center, the new King George VI, a man who must speak to and inspire his people as they head into war. And the poor man can not speak at all.Firth, guided by director Tom Hooper, does such an excellent job portraying the stammering prince who would become an inspiring king. There was a fine line to be walked with how exactly to portray the stammer. Go too far with it and the film might be unbearably uncomfortable to watch. Don't go far enough and the events of the film will seem nowhere near as consequential as they should. Firth gets it just about perfectly right. There are moments where it is a little bit uncomfortable. But that's kind of the point. This was a painful affliction for Albert to live with and at times it was truly painful for anyone who had to listen to him. This is never more evident than in the film's opening scene, in which Albert gives his first big, public speech. It goes terribly. He is embarrassed. Everyone listening is embarrassed for him. Enter Lionel Logue.Geoffrey Rush plays Logue, Albert's speech therapist. Firth and Rush prove to be a winning combination, they play off one another so well. Albert's frustrations mount, his temper often boils over. But Logue is always there to guide him forward. In this test of wills commoner Logue will prove to be just as strong as the man who would be king. It's a sort of buddy film but one with serious consequences. Albert's brother, David, ascends to the throne but he's not long for the job. Crisis of his own making causes David, who clearly was never going to be much of a king anyway, to step down. Albert is now king. And the new King George VI needs Lionel Logue more than Prince Albert ever did.The film, as most films of this sort do, takes some liberties with some historical facts but the gist of the true story shines through. And it really is a remarkable story. An inspiring story too, and so well performed by the two key players, Firth and Rush. There are notable performances as well from Guy Pearce and Helena Bonham Carter. Pearce plays David, the man who is ever so briefly King Edward VIII. Burdened with a responsibility he does not want, and obsessed with a love which is forbidden, David is a tough character to play. Pearce does well to make you feel sympathy for him when appropriate and to make you want to punch him in the face when that is appropriate. Carter plays Albert's ever-supportive wife, a woman who is a rock he can always lean on. An easy character to love. Pearce, Carter and other supporting players add a great deal to the proceedings. Notable are a few nice moments sprinkled in with the king's young daughters, one of whom, Elizabeth, has quite a future ahead of her. But of course the film is really all about King George VI and Lionel Logue. And in playing those roles Firth and Rush elevate the whole film. While it is certainly a compelling story it is not the liveliest thing you've ever seen. There are times it is somewhat slowly paced, times things seem a little mundane. But you know the stakes. The king has to find his voice. A nation, an empire, depends on it. It was such a struggle for the king. Firth brilliantly brings that struggle to life. The King's Speech is, if not a tremendous film, certainly a very good one. Firth's performance? That most certainly is tremendous.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The worst movie I've ever seen in my life.,"I'm not over-exaggerating, I actually haven't seen many bad movies. And I wasn't dragged to see this, I just figured since it's a movie, it couldn't be bad.Now my reviews aren't based on whether the movie delivered a good message or not, I honestly don't care about the message. And either way, the message of this movie wasn't at all amazing. My ratings are based on how much I enjoyed watching the movie, and a bit before an hour into this movie, I felt like killing myself out of claustrophobia.The movie had no colour, other than brown, black and white. It was depressing to watch. If this is honestly how England looked back in the 30s, then just DON'T MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT IT. Why on Earth would we want to be reminded about how colourless and boring the world was? I did like ""The Godfather"" though, it felt much less claustrophobic, and it was based near the same time period. This movie made me feel so enclosed, and trapped, and I couldn't even finish watching it. I ran out of the theatre 15 minutes early, but my parents explained what happened. Nothing interesting happened in the movie. Somebody has a speech impediment, SO WHAT? TONS OF PEOPLE HAVE SPEECH IMPEDIMENTS! TONS OF PEOPLE WERE ABUSED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD! THAT'S NOTHING NEW AT ALL! This movie looks like it was made in the 70s, but even if I watched it in the 70s, I still wouldn't like it. As I mentioned before, it made me feel claustrophobic. This may be because there were only 2 major settings where more than 2 minutes of footage occurred, or maybe because of the lack of colour. Although I think it's because of the horribly tiny and simple story.My father had to explain to me what the movie was really about, but the meaning has absolutely NO EFFECT on anybody. Times have changed, we've heard it before. So what? I can't believe somebody can actually LIKE this movie. It's horribly over-rated. The king had no historical importance, so why should we even care about him?",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The King's Speech: 10/10,"The King's Speech is visual stunning with it's fantastic cinematography, dramatic performances from the cast, and it's perfect pacing.The story set back in the early 1930s when World War II was beginning. King George V was serious ill and when he died, he gave the throne to his oldest son. Unfortunately, George's oldest son was dethroned by the Parliment and gave the spot to the next oldest son, (Berty, Colin Firth). Berty became King George VI and carrying on his shoulder the weight of going to war. Giving a wartime speech is clearly very important at the time but it was proved very difficult since Berty had a stammering problem ever since he was little. His wife, Elizabeth, seeked help from a ""speech therapist"", Lionel (Geoffrey Rush). Although he was helping the king of England, Lionel treats Berty as if he was a normal guy. Earning trust throughout the months from the king, Geoffrey was able to help the king give a decent speech. Predictable, but there wasn't supposed to be any surprises.Colin Firth is perhaps the only actor in Hollywood who can stammer his lines as good as he was in this film. But stammering and pausing in between words isn't going to cut it. Giving an emotional yet humorous performance, Colin Firth has guaranteed himself a spot in this year's Academy Awards.Firth isn't the only one who stood out. His companions Helena Bohem Carter and Geoffrey Rush is probably the best choice for the roles they played. Playing the king's wife and had very little lines, Helena Bohen Carter is still eligible for her second Oscar nomination which she will earn. Geoffrey Rush as a teacher isn't the best idea, but seeing him on screen is gripping in every which way.David Seidler delivered a very top-class script that points towards the Oscars in every direction. Making Colin Firth pausing in between everything he says and Geoffrey Rush's smooth language, Seidler is about to earn himself a first Oscar nomination.Tom Hooper directed this without holding back proving himself to be one of the better directors in Hollywood. Making an R-rated film only because of a few F-words shows that he was willing to make the film for what it is, not to get a larger audience. With great knowledge on the era and fantastic style, Tom Hooper is the guy to watch out for. Solidly written, beautifully cinematographed, elegantly directed, and perfectly acted, The King's Speech might be the Best Picture contender to look out for (The Social Network).OscarBuzz: A lot but here are the major, Best Picture (might win), Best Director (good chance), Best Actor (Colin Firth, might win), Best Supporting Actress (good chance), Best Supporting Actor (Geoffrey Rush, might win), Best Screenplay (good chance)I thought The Social Network was going to definitely win the Best Picture, but after seeing this, I don't know who's going to win anymore.

A Triumph,"While special effects, juvenile humor and poor acting typify so many American movies, it's nice to know the tradition of films with fine acting and direction is not yet a dead art. This historical drama teaches a part of history we thought we knew but brings up details many of us were not aware of. The scandal and poor judgment of Edward VIII was widely known, but not the struggle of George VI. The acting of the two main characters is magnificent and the expertly timed Direction is likewise. Views of a much younger Queen Mother and Elizabeth II were also well done. Recommended for discerning and intelligent film fans who remember what made certain old films a classic (hint; it wasn't technology).Having been to England three times, I admit I have a bias anyway towards British movies and culture in general.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Shining a light on the monarchy,"George VI's stammer seems like an unpromising subject for a film treatment, but what a highly polished gem this small-budget movie is. Like THE QUEEN, it gets off to an unpromising start. Just as Helen Mirren took a while to get used to as Elizabeth II, so Helena Bonham-Carter doesn't look much like a younger version of Elizabeth's namesake and brown-toothed old mum (a National Treasure, of course!). Michael Gambon looks a bit like George V and Timothy Spall makes a nice jowly growly Churchill, but Colin Firth and Guy Pearce are nothing like the royal brothers George (Bertie) and Edward (David, later Duke of Windsor). Anthony Andrews (who once played Edward VIII in a dire mini-series) seems out of his depth as Mr Baldwin, but there's an excellent Chamberlain and Eve Best makes the best Wallis Simpson since Who-was-she? in the Edward Fox TV version of The Abdication which set the gold standard. Claire Bloom and Derek Jaconi contribute fine cameos as Queen Mary and Archbishop Cosmo Lang, representing the 'Old Guard'.What matters, of course, is not how good they look but how well they play, and they play very well indeed. Much like Mirren in THE QUEEN (again), Firth and Bonham-Carter inhabit the roles and convince you that this must be how the Prince's/King's impediment was overcome. Lionel Logue, the rough-diamond Aussie voice coach, is a gift of a part, and Geoffrey Rush attacks it full-on. He must be a shoo-in for every award going; Firth and Bonham-Carter are pretty certain to get BAFTAs, but the Oscars are sometimes more whimsically awarded.The actual Abdication (and the 'woman I love' speech) have been done too often and this version adds nothing new, but there's a nice moment when Elizabeth snubs Wallis at a gaudy party. If I have a quibble with the writing, it's over Logue's insolent insistence on calling his pupil 'Bertie'. Even if this was the case, it doesn't ring true; I can't see how calling him 'Sir' would have reduced the effectiveness of the regimen. Some of the treatments make for jolly viewing - singing and swinging arms and shouting F-words (Elizabeth sitting on Bertie's tum may be far-fetched, but it makes for a charming scene) - and when he is put to the test on the BBC, you positively ache for it to go well.Comparisons with THE QUEEN are hard to avoid. Both films shine a light into corners of the palaces we don't normally see, but it's done tastefully and tactfully. Our heritage - the Monarchy itself - is in no way diminished. The Queen Mum comes out of it particularly well. Plaudits to all concerned.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Rather than stammer in its paces, The King's Speech is a wondrously concise and pleasingly executed piece enrapturing us in the plight of its lead.","With The King's Speech, rising British director Tom Hooper revisits some familiar thematic ground upon which he had previously trodden with his 2009 feature The Damned United; specifically, his multi-award winning, and highly acclaimed class-comedy posing as a period/costume drama, zeroes in on a chapter more inclined towards failure or fault. This chapter of such things within the life of an individual one may, or may not, have heard an awful lot about, and yet are coerced into recognising a certain amount of fame or success prominent in their legacy, is the subject for The King's Speech, an impressive and wonderfully taut film rich in comedy as well as crackling dialogue delivered with aplomb by those therein.Principally, the core item either film share is that the respective pieces are about chapters in the predominantly rich in incident, and plentiful in most other things, lives of two people built on failure and revolving around strife or struggles seemingly out of sync with everything else. Hooper's 2009 film The Damned United covered the exploits of a man with a wonderful stature and esteemed ability in the field of football management, he being Brian Clough; the film about a chapter of inadequateness with a football squad whom it was seemingly impossible not to garner some kind of success with, around which Clough's managerial career has passed into legend.Here and now, with this Best Picture and BAFTA Best Film as-well-as-mostly-everything-else-under-the-sun winner from the crossover awards year 2010 to 2011, we observe the covering of that of Colin Firth's Prince Albert, later as George whilst King in an attempt to veer away from the ""Germanic"" roots of his Christian name, and his terrifying speech impediment that he had for as long as he could remember going a long way to rendering public speaking and radio broadcasts near-impossible. The short of it is that the film is as much a success as both Hooper's previous effort and most of what the buzz makes out of it, a film adhering to those writings of not-so-long-ago that most, if not all, of Britain's comedy is entirely imbued with a sense of class distinction or class clashing, but a telling of a rousing tale about a man confronting his fears or problems or demons, located wholly within himself, before gunning to win through in the end.It is 1930s Britain, George V (Gambon) sits atop the throne over the British Isles and its Commonwealth with his son Edward (Pearce) lying in wait ahead of our Albert, whose problems with speaking, both publicly and privately, see all manner of social interaction with family and friends often go awry. We begin with a microphone dominating the screen, its presence overbearing and its sheer size magnified to overly dramatic affect, so much so that a longer shot of the room it is in dwarfs it in comparison thus revealing the honesty of its nature. A gentleman is ready to go on the air and is going through his regimented routine whilst making the entire process look very easy; an establishment of specialists in this field doing what they do and managing to tone down the intimidating presence of the microphone into something else feeling prominent. The sequence is in stark contrast to that of our inception into Albert's world of speaking, doing as such at Wembley Stadium, no less, on a cold day drenched in grey cinematography and failing to make what has just been established as the respectable grade. This attempt at an expansive speech proves to be the final straw, Albert's, or Bertie to his close companions, wife Elizabeth (Bonham Carter), The Duchess of York, then going on to seek the help Albert needs.This help arrives in the form of Geoffrey Rush's all but show-stealing turn as Lionel Logue, a true to life Australian speech therapist whose base of operations is quite literally down in the depths of a building accessible only by cramped elevator. The Duchess has heard of certain buzzwords relating to Logue she usually looks upon with scorn; class distinctions and the physical necessity for the royals to have to literally 'descend' to Logue's class level in speaking to him prominent. Upon initially meeting him, he skips out of his lavatory and speaks freely towards her; later visits from Albert seeing Hooper shoot Firth's character with a ropey, dull background of peeling wallpaper and such whilst Logue is allowed all the richness and activity of furniture as well as the rest of his abode behind him – where class has previously been used to cite distinctions between one and the other, it is Logue whom Albert is frequenting for aid and their respective distinctions here are broken apart.With Logue arrives his free-speaking and outlandish methods, of which persistently and really effectively blur lines between what are merely his methods and what might be mere arrogance; the seeds for such prejudices over that of the rich arriving when Logue is cast away by a stage director whom dismisses him during an stage reenactment despite Logue's fruitful credentials in playing the part. Around all of this brew the events which will push Albert into a stark confrontation with his issue, a going up against what it is his weakness is with what he'll have learnt as well as fought through the means of combating everything. George V's ever-deteriorating health and the fact it looks increasingly likely Edward will not make for a decent monarch but for his playboy lifestyle infused ways combine with George's own literal reiteration of the abilities one will require in calming a nation that'll be brought to its knees if the correct things are not said, done and related to as background stuff brewing on the Continent unfolds. Hooper's film is a resounding, pleasing cinematic spectacle; the bringing to life of a tale from decades ago and telling it with the sort of pathos and confidence that is entirely welcome.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The King's Speech: Not just a film for history buffs,"Each year there comes a handful of British films that are so stuffy and so annoyingly high brow, that it would seem one would have to have obtained their PhD in English Lit. (emphasis on the works of Monty Python) to understand anything happening on screen; ""The King's Speech"" is not one of those films. Directed in epic format by Tom Hooper (The Damned United), Colin Firth (A Single Man) and Geoffrey Rush (Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl) star in the true story of King George VI, who turned to a radical speech therapist to overcome his stutter. It may not sound like the most intriguing premise in the world, but Hooper and this sublime cast make it one of the most engaging and powerful films of the year.Firth is absolutely memorizing as King George VI, having total command of his every mannerism as well as that trademark stutter. Firth should easily win a Golden Globe, as well as an Oscar, as well as the ""Movies With Markus Award"" (hopefully a real thing one day) for best leading actor in a dramatic role. His performance in ""The King's Speech"" is undoubtedly the best acting performance of the year (mark my words)! And no, I didn't forget about Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street), who gives a truly royal performance as Queen Elizabeth.Side note: Even though this may not be the best film of the year, this will undoubtedly win the best picture for the Golden Globes (Don't ask. It's politics). So if you are the betting type MPAA, what is going on with your rating system?!: Why does this film hold an R rating? Because of TWO scenes depicting intense language (all pertaining to King George VI's speech therapy mind you). That is a shame, for when it's all said and done, ""The Kings Speech"" is an historic/educational film that has been cut off from a wider audience because of a few F bombs. I guess hearing the F word is more detrimental to anyone under 17, than watching a person blow another persons brains out. What does that say about American society? Anyways Final Thought: This film can only be described as a magnificent endeavor of British film-making. With much of the same dramatic luster of British films such as ""The Queen"" and ""Atonement"", ""The Kings Speech"" will go down as a film classic and (need I say it) a must see this awards season. This film is nothing short of one of the best films of the year!

A  Movie That Will Inspire You.,"Having learnt in History about King George VI suffering from stammering, and indeed, I myself, having suffered from the same speech impediment, I was very interested to know how Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II's, father dealt with this. I had also learnt about his elder brother – ""Edward and Mrs Simpson"" and had also watched the TV series all those years ago, which starred Edward Fox.The movie, directed by Tom Hooper, begins by depicting the 1930's London and how a member of the Royal family approaches a man who can help her husband to overcome his problem. The scenes, showing authenticity, depict such scenes as a person walking in front of a car, which did take place in those early days of the motor industry so as to avoid accidents and really set the theme and the atmosphere. This then depicts the reason why the King's elder brother abdicates and the pressure that the younger brother, King George VI, faces.Colin Firth, as the King, portrays the King , in a manner that makes one believe that he really has the problem and delivers his dialogues in an a most believable manner and at the same time makes one feel that he really does have this problem.Helena Bonham Carter, as the Queen Mother, is also, excellent and executes her role in a way that shows her brilliance as actress. The two little girls, who portray the roles of Princess's Elizabeth and Margaret, also perform very well. Another actor, who really excels in his performance as the man who helps the King, ""Lionel Logue,"" is Geoffrey Rush, who acts the character that makes one feel like believing in him, as a therapist. As a matter of fact, I remembered my therapist, putting me through almost the same exercises as he puts the King through them.This was one film that I found most inspiring and even though I have overcome that problem and when one thinks back to the problem it makes them feel inspired.Today, I, myself am involved in media and broadcasting and will say that ""this is one movie that is well worth watching.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Straight-Forward-Kitsch (why not?),"The labelling 'kitsch' may be too critical. But this film has no reluctance whatsoever to indulge in melodramatic stereo-types (e.g. it's use of music, of historical characters (e.g. Churchill), the narrative structure of the hero who overcomes his impairs with the help of an adviser and so forth).Having said that - the film partially manages to engage the viewer.Even though its classical narrative structure makes the film totally predictable.But overall I don't like the film because:1) it is so obviously a Oscar vehicle2) it pretends to be some kind of historical piece - but it's obviously royal kitsch. The story could been taken from any average royals-magazine (it has to be said though, that screenplays can employ trash-story-lines and make wonderful films out of it - but here it isn't the case).3) it is only engaging in the beginning. Towards the middle the conflict between the king and its adviser turns out to be rather constructed/ artificial - to create some kind of suspense.4) with 8.3 points it is terribly overrated (though the acting is marvelous)",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Brilliant uplifting film,"I saw this film on the recommendation of my 19 year old step son, who only saw it as he couldn't get in to see Gullivers Travels. He has no interest in history or the Royal Family and a limited knowledge of the period. He raved about it, claiming it was the best film he'd seen in ages and so I went.It is one of those films where you can't help but get involved. Each excruciating word was being mouthed by the audience and the sense of relief and happiness at the end, was palpable.Fantastic acting, great dialogue, brilliant costumes and the only slight fault would be in some of the backdrop/scene settings, which looked slightly false (didn't have the Avatar budget I guess). The audience age spread was the widest I've ever known it and if your parents/grandparents remember George VI, you must take them along to see it.If this doesn't win a hat full of Oscars then there is no justice in this world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Simply The Best Film Of The Year!,"I admit to have been slightly disappointed when I found out that this modest and low-key film won the top honors beating the much loved films like 'The Social Network', 'True Grit', 'Inception' and 'Black Swan'. But I remembered what James Cameron said about the Oscars. They are meant to celebrate films, which the world would not see, but must see.It took me some time to get the film on my pen-drives, but like the eponymous King himself and his devoted wife the Queen Elizabeth, it always takes to close shut another door of the elevator to reach the destination. And the results were well worth the wait.We begin in misty 1925, a nervous Duke Of York, called as Bertie by his family, walks up to a rostrum to address an epilogue to the speech made by his father, none other than the King George V. The anxious Duke keeps on rehearsing his writeup, while the BBC guys fix everything up for the much anticipated broadcast. The sheer and meticulous detail amazes us while the Duke's diffidence feels authentic than ever.The so-called Duke would be crowned in time as the much lauded and loved George VI. But before he can achieve those heights, Tom Hooper's film shows us a vulnerable and awkward side to this great and celebrated monarch of England. We see Bertie struggling with a speech impediment that renders him unable to give speeches and smoothly or even narrate a fairy tale to his daughters with elan. Yeah, the family might not think about the man's difficulties but the world cannot think too highly about a future monarch who cannot even speak to to his subjects.Hooper and writer David Seidler create a genuine situation of alarm for this struggling and dejected aristocrat, beautifully played by Colin Firth. The Duke is not just a man with a problem that has destroyed his confidence. He is intrinsically a small boy who is unable to muster up enough resolve for both kingship and also his problem to be solved. Yet, he also wants to overcome his difficulties and do what his domineering father, his careless and callous sibling Edward, and the whole Empire demands from him. Firth plays his role to perfection, embodying the pain and helplessness in his awkwardness and a childlike obstinacy in his arguments. It is a role that won him the Oscar. Deservedly!Hooper provide another angle to the man's hopes and aspirations. This is the Australian teacher Lionel Logue, who tutors him to overcome the stutter both medically and psychologically. The relationship between the two unlikely friends begins to develop and change with every twist of the plot but Logue's inspiring, if radical, methods shape the new King's confidence and his personal redemption. It is he who compels him to overcome his inner complexities and embrace his obligations fully.Hooper and Seidler have made a fascinating film that inspires us to look deep and explore our strengths and weaknesses. But this is not a film that explores only Bertie's transformation. They also examine his relationships with people around him, his wife who stands by him right till the end and the brother, who cares little about his improvements. Guy Pierce deserves a mention for his malicious role as the self-centered Edward but next to Firth, only one man stands tall. This is Geoffrey Rush as Logue. The actor displays patience, resilience and even abundant wit as he stands parallel to Bertie's inner difficulties.The King's Speech is truly the best film of 2010. It is a beautifully crafted story of how there is a weaker man inside every legendary figure and how weaknesses have to be overcome to achieve the destined greatness. The cinematography is wonderfully atmospheric and also metaphorical to Bertie's transformation. Hooper creates mesmerizing sequences which heighten the emotions and the conversations between Logue and Bertie are packed with emotion, revelations and a genuine rapport.And as the climactic speech commences, we are gripped thoroughly as a man wakes up and inspires the world and the kingdom under his command. Wow!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
a performance driven masterpiece,This year James Franco had to act against a rock and Jeff Bridges had to rehash The Duke himself but nothing beats Colin Farrell having to stutter. This is the performance of the year if not the decade and it having come out in theaters in the Christmas season of 2010 I almost had to wait 10 more years to make that statement. Colin Firth plays the stuttering King George VI whose wife The Queen Of England hires Lionel a speech teacher fantastically performed by Gwoffrey Rush. Lionel's an offbeat guy who has certain methods (the only ones that happen to work in all of England) to stop King George VI's stuttering. These could of easily been annoying performance that could have both been way over the top but both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush mix the right amount of goofiness and heart into their performances.The King's Speech comes without flaws it's beautifully directed terrifically executed but most of all it's acted to the highest degree. This is the best acted film of this year and I can't see anyone else but Colin Firth winning best actor..he throws himself into the role and is painfully realistic.,10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Excellent,"I thought long and hard what rating I should give this film. I enjoyed it. The cinematography was well done, the music was good, the actors were absolutely perfect, the script was well-paced... And I'm not sure if I should give it a 10.In the end, I decided on a 9, because there is always room for improvement(yes, cliché!). Although in this case, I'll be hard-pressed to nitpick on anything.I was moved by Colin Firth's and Helena Bonham Carter's performances(why does she have such a long name??""). There was a part in the film as part of the therapy which really unnerved me. Colin's portrayal was so heart-wrenching, and this combined with the fact that I never knew the what the King went through... I was shocked and even slightly emotional. The whole film felt so authentic to me, because everyone fit in their characters so well.The stuttering was very well done, and even towards the end of the show I still felt nervous for Bertie because we do not know when he might have a relapse. I attribute it to the unpredictable pacing of his speech, which feels especially real to me because he is trying to control his stuttering, and no one knows when he might lose that control for a moment.In all, this is one of the most impactful films I've seen in recent years. I'm sure most other reviews will tell you the same.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Words fail me,"Best film we've seen since English Patient.What a treat to be reminded once again that films are in fact about people and their relationships. The more believable these are the more we are drawn in to the magic and can share the emotion. In 'The Kings Speech' we have a film that draws you in utterly to the intense and crucifying pain of a stutterer, one who just happens to be heir to the throne of England and at a time when one particular live speech might influence the course of history.Despite the possibilities of pomp and circumstance, the style is austere, claustrophobic even. The last shot aside, its foggy out, rooms are sparsely furnished (even the palace!) and the camera is forever on the faces of the 'beyond words good' cast. This invites the closest scrutiny of the unfolding relationship of Logue and Bertie, and in every possible degree this is found 'pitch perfect'.From the opening scene, where Bertie walks up the steps to give his address at Wembley, you know you are watching something rather special. The miked stutter echo-ing over the silent and increasingly embarrassed crowd will long live in my memory I think. So will the scenes in Logue's consultation room, where the film had some outrageously funny moments, but at no cost to the building tension.I have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone, of any nationality, creed or age. That it is about the English royal family is purely incidental in my view. This is an acting tour-de-force and an inspiration to one and all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Very well-done & entertaining for a film about a stuttering early 19th-century royal,"Even having dated a speech therapist for a while, I was not extremely excited about watching what I thought would be stuffy Oscar bait about an early-20th-century British royal stutterer. The film was a little stuffy, it was definitely (succesful) Oscar bait, and it was about a stammering duke and his petulant speech therapist (who was nowhere near as hot as the one I dated). However, it was extremely well-acted, well-written, well-filmedand just overall well-done. This movie will hold your attention and teach you some history you may not already know. It is very-much worth the 2 hours to watch, although the subject matter doesn't exactly make it a Must Seeunless you're a 20th-century-British-history buff.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out: www.livemancave.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"A stammering performance, in a positive way","The trailer didn't really intrigue me, but this is a magnificent film that should not be judged by the trailers. In fact most trailers I got hyped up for disappointed me for 2010 but this one was a pleasant surprise. It isn't one of the best movie I seen for 2010 and isn't for everyone, since it lacks action and revolves around characters just talking to each other most of the time. But it's still a charming movie, despite it's main build up is trying to get a king to speak properly. This is a historical drama about King George VI having a difficult time speaking in public or giving a speech, because he has a very difficult time overcoming his stammering. Colin Firth puts on a stammering performance in this movie, and Geoffrey Rush did a excellent job as a supporting actor while playing the role of Lionel Logue. Who is the person that helps the king the best he can with the kings stammering. In order for the king's speech to be the strength of the people during difficult times. This movie didn't leave me speechless or anything like that, but it's a pretty good movie that is worth seeing at least once and the aspect of bonding and friendship is done pretty good as well.

The King's Speech,"Tom Hooper directs an ace of a film driven at the helm by Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. Both men appeared to flawlessly represent the friendship of King George VI and Lionel Logue.All I can really say is I was taken away by specific scenes involving King George's internal struggle with self-confidence and his external struggles about actually being a king. I praise many scenes from the movie, but the one where Firth is all dressed as the King coming back from an unsuccessful speech is really memorable to me. He comes back to his family disappointed and concerned for his future. And as he appears in front of his two daughters he stands internally upset about his stammer and the well-being of his family. Then, one of the two daughters says ""Your Majesty"", in awe of her father's newly decorated uniform. The unbelievable pressure of what King George went through is seen and quite evident. Firth plays the troubled heir to the throne to a tee. The emotions on his face could explain the situations at hand easily and without overacting. And when Firth and Rush are on screen, their presence is at times overwhelming. This is also a great turn for Helena Bonham Carter, who too, did a fantastic job as King George's lover, and friend.The story itself is very interesting and was portrayed well on screen.Watch out 2011 Oscars, there are some sweet performances heading your way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Not so sure why Helena was nominated for best supporting actress. I would see the movie again, I was sorry to see it end. The historical aspect of the movie is outstanding.

Inspiring story well told.,"The movie does not open with the Weinsteins saying ""we thank the Academy for their consideration"" but beyond this omission this film is pure Oscar bait. And frankly it deserves to garner a number of the naked yellow ditch diggers. Most assuredly one of these should go to Colin Firth who plays the spineless, stuttering King George VI-one of the more unattractive royal characters in recent memory-with historical accuracy but yet making him a sympathetic character. A second statue should go Helena Bonham Carter. Although she has to do little more than be encouraging and sympathetic to her hamster of a husband in this film she turns in yet another great performance and this plus a string of memorable characters in a long career should get her the award. Geoffrey Rush will also likely win although his character is the unfailing witty, charming hero throughout the 2 hour run time so he really didn't need to work that hard. It should also win a slew of technical awards for cinematography, art direction and costuming - the production is impeccable. This Best Picture nominee shoe-in and likely favorite to win has only those shortcomings common to large-scale historical costume dramas - the run-time is a little long, some parts slow beyond comfort and it lacks a real personal connection beyond the miniscule portion of the audience that remembers these events. Also, ""The King's Speech"" has to be the least compelling title in recent memory - where were the marketing people? If Hooper's creation doesn't come up big Oscar night part of the reason may somewhat represent fatigue over the sheer number of movies about English royalty of late (""The Queen"", ""Young Victoria"", ""Elizabeth"" and ""Elizabeth 2"", ""The Duchess"", etc.). Speaking of which, when does Wallis Simpson get her big screen treatment? The older, twice divorced American born ""Bessie"" briefly ruled one-fourth of the world through her domination of King Edward VIII and wound up with a Duchy. Her story cries out for a biopic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Fine film with only the slightest whiff of the waxworks.,"Judging from few of the reviews, some viewers of this excellent film have appeared to let their anti-monarchical sentiments get the better of them. I will say at the onset that Iam a bit of an Anglophile, and that while Iam hardly an apologist for the British monarchy( I really don't give a darn about Bill and Kates nuptials, and I pity Rowan Williams for having to explain the sacrament of marriage to them.), I also find most of the trendy knee-jerk criticism of the monarchy boring. Having said that, I found this a profoundly moving,well acted, richly detailed film. It was not a startlingly innovative example of cinematic art, and it had few deep insights into the human condition. The greatest strength of the film was its wonderful acting. Colin Firth was superb as an well-meaning but emotionally crippled, limited, man thrust into the tragicomic status of a monarch.Geoffrey Rush was very good as his therapist, both a healer and a frustrated actor.The always underrated Guy Pearce captured the flippancy, decadence, nd essential nihilism of Edward the seventh. Helena Bonham Carter was excellent as the devoted wife.There were moments of stiffness and ""historical pageant' in some of's the supporting roles.( Hey there's Churchill! There's Chamberlain! There's Baldwin!"") But this didn't feel all too much like an extended episode of Masterpiece Theater.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The King's Speech: 7/10,"The fact that this film fails to impress me does surprise myself, the accumulating buzz in the upcoming Oscar can only explain one thing, that some people don't want to see a sweep of THE SOCIAL NETWORK, which will definitely cause the whole Oscar game way too predictable, so they select one out of other nine BEST PICTURE-nominated films, and keep everybody by rivaling these two so-called frontrunners.In my personal list, currently THE SOCIAL NETWORK is my No.3 of the year, INCEPTION and THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT are my No.1 and No.2 respectively. After watching this film, I must confess that I am 90% sure BEST PICTURE and BEST DIRECTOR will go to TSN.TKS is a solid film, an unparalleled stammer performance from Colin Firth, which will endow him with his first Oscar in the BEST ACTOR category (I love Colin, but he should win last year with A SINGLE MAN instead of this one). Geoffrey Rush is strong but patchy in his co-leading role (typically not a supporting role, anyway category fraud does attenuate Oscar's halo), his insidious eyes and cartoonish appearance emancipated a rather uncomfortable perception to me and it's hard to believe he was not playing a vicious villain. As Helena Bonham Carter, her self-restrained acting, on the contrary, becomes my favorite in the film, she could be a potential dark horse in the Oscar race. Guy Pearce and Jennifer Ehle both offer some nuance in spite of their limited screen-time.As a whole, the film is an exquisite design, almost everything is on a high-class level, except the empathy, I feel no emotional turbulence all along the time, every twist is stock, It was as if I was watching a chic play (without involuntary affection at all) as the same time I don't care what was happening in the film, which I was too placid to care. In my opinion, the mordant script is the most award-worthy one among all its nominations.I felt baffled after watching the film, because I don't think my taste is so far away from others (judging by previous experience of course), how come this time TKS truly disappointed me so much? Maybe a re-watch? I don't know by now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Great, but could have gone deeper","The King's Speech is a marvelously shot film with brilliant acting. The plot & story is interesting but obviously predictable.Colin Firth's performance is top notch but there is no doubt that Geoffrey Rush steals all the scenes.My main bug issue with the film is that it only scratches the surface. The movie is at its best when it delves deeper into the trauma of George VI, showing why he is in pain & hence, where his stammer comes from. Unfortunately, only one scene delves deep into the matter, while other expose the abuse. But nothing really substantial, really intense is seen to really send the message across.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The power of friendship and the will to overcome your limits,"It's hard to make the royal family relatable, but no movie has come closer than The King's Speech. Maybe because Prince Albert lacked the typical characteristics of a monarch. A quiet life far from the spotlight would be fine by him. But fate had other plans and he is suddenly King George VI, having to face his stammering and all the insecurities and weaknesses that come with it in order to lead the British Empire in view of the dark times that were ahead.His companion in this challenging journey is an Australian, a failed actor turned into a speech therapist famous for his unorthodox methods.The power of their ""impossible"" (for anyone interested in those types of relationships, Green Book or Intouchables would be some other examples) friendship and the King's sheer will to overcome the obstacles - not external ones, but his own limits, an even more daunting task - are the two driving forces of The King's Speech that will touch and inspire any viewer.Another refreshing factor is that the movie avoids stepping into a desperately serious mode, there's lots of humour without ever becoming ""cheap"".The plot is somewhat predictable and one can easily see where it is going, but a)you can't change the facts, that's how it happened and it actually deserves extra credit for its historical accuracy and b)the plot is secondary, the movie's primary focus is the characters.The top-notch cast delivers an acting masterclass, spearheaded by Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter.The movie's looks are also commendable, the set design in Logue's office, his house and of course the room where King George VI delivered the final speech being some of the highlights.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
boring film,"I didn't get what the point of this film was...It wasn't entertaining and it was too slow. The story was annoying. Who cares about a king with a stutter? Why should we care? The conflict wasn't very clear. Overall I didn't enjoy this film. The acting was OK, the direction was good but the screenplay is a drag along with the story. The music was boring too and there was nothing fun about the film. I watched this in the theater because I was curious but I guess I made a mistake... Why Hollywood make some boring films (besides transformers, action/comedy films, spider man and wolverine!)...And all the boring films win awards when quality, entertaining films should win.

"Bravo, Mr. Firth","Loved it, yet it made me sad. It's a close-up portrait of a royal who isn't really cut out for the job, yet recognizes his responsibility and painstakingly overcomes a dreadful childhood, horrible debilitation, and impossible family (a family with which we can identify, despite their blue blood) to ascend to his duties. Firth, never overacting, takes us deep into the king-to-be's pain, sense of hopelessness, and frustration, and also emphasizes his essential decency; loved the scenes with the young Elizabeth and Margaret, showing what a superb father and loving husband he was. Shot in ""Masterpiece Theatre"" style, it's very civilized and proper, and perhaps overworks the humanizing angle; whether Bertie will give a proper speech or not is weighted to be more important than the fact that England is entering a devastating war on his command. But what saddened me was, it's such an old-fashioned movie--no crashes, no overt special effects, no sex, no violence. And all those things may have their place in movies, but I think the industry has become overdependent on them, at the expense of offering human stories. This is a human story, presented gently, straightforwardly, and literately, and good as it is and as much as the audience with me enjoyed it, I don't think we'll be getting many more movies like it.

"A little unhistorical, but a fun movie","It's a historical drama set in England in 1925 and again from 1934 to the start of World War II in 1939. It follows the interaction between Prince Albert/King George VI and his speech therapist, Lionel Logue.Prince Albert (Colin Firth) gives a disastrous speech in 1925 at Wembley Stadium due to the stammer he has had since childhood. It appears his father, King George V's (Michael Gambon) strict, almost abusive, raising of Albert only made it worse. Albert's brother, David/King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce), is first in line to the throne but persists in an affair with twice-divorced American Wallis Simpson (Eve Best).After unsuccessful consultations with other therapists, Albert's wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), persuades him to try Australian Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). The film follows their interaction, events around King George V's death, King Edward VIII's abdication, and King George VI's accession to the throne. Humor is provided by interactions with a pompous Archbishop Cosmo Lang (Derek Jacobi), and a heavily-jowled Winston Churchhill (Timothy Spall). The film ends with the King's speech at the beginning of World War II.Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush have excellent chemistry. Michael Gambon and Helena Bonham Carter are also superb. The storyline is narrow but fully exploited by the creative script. Unfortunately, it appears much of the drama is created and not historical. King George VI made many speeches without Logue's presence, and the scriptwriters conveniently adjusted his relationships with the various prime ministers to enhance King George VI. I suspect the warm family life we see was also air-brushed. Still, it's a fun movie to watch and highlights a speech issue experienced by many.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Better Dramas Are Hard to Find.,"Winner of four Oscars, The King's Speech is the best pure drama of the past four years. The acting is superb and genuine, giving the audience a peak into the life and pressures of King George VI. Collin Firth's human and down to earth portrayal of royalty gives the film a human quality which is hard to find in period films similar to this one. Firth's venerability, is what truly sets it apart. Geoffrey Rush delivers the performance of his lifetime.The Cinematographic originality also gives the film a unique, yet classic heir to it. Tom Hooper paints a straightforward story, in a somewhat old- fashioned style, without any gimmicks or tricks and nails it. For those of you who haven't yet seen this masterpiece, I recommend it go straight to the top of your bucket list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A very fine movie,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in several years. It tells a moving story in a moving but never sentimental way. I was never bored for one instant. The acting is uniforming superlative. Colin Firth makes you feel Bertie's shame and anger at not being able to speak forcefully, not being able to do what his father, especially, but also his brother do so well, complicated by the fact that he has been raised never to express his feelings. If he doesn't get at least an Academy Award nomination for this role, I will be surprised and very much disgusted. Geoffrey Rush is funny but imposing as the speech therapist who has his own unsuccessful aspirations. The actor who plays Churchill SOUNDS like Churchill.But this is basically a two-man show, like Amadeus, which its use of Mozart recalls to mind on occasion. And, as with Amadeus, both actors are completely up to the task.My only criticism, and it is a mild one, is that Bertie comes off as a rather weak individual, though various characters keep saying that is is strong. I think it would have helped if, early in the movie, we had been given a few instances of his strength and perseverance. All we see is a man who is terrified of speaking into a microphone who cries a lot.But that is very minor indeed.To me, this is very definitely a 10. A movie that could be seen more than once with a great deal of enjoyment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

A common man after all,"But one with special responsibilities. This movie about the drama of King George VI because of his severe stammer and the fact that due to his position first as a prince and later as a king, this is a great problem, may be considered by republicans as dealing with something not worth of great interest or value since they abhor and despise monarchy and monarchist institutions. But we must see this as the true historical fact that had political impact not only in the UK but even in Europe or the world. The voice limitation of the Chief of State of a great European power in such critical times as the Thirties of last century was, with the ascension of Nazism putting a dark cloud over Europe and the world, a theme worth a movie or any other artistic or literary work. And this movie tells us this dramatic story in a very effective and realistic way with all performers doing an excellent job. The movie direction was a solid one, recreating very well the British palatial atmosphere of those times and showing us very expressively the sometimes tumultuous relationship between the stammering prince and his very peculiar speech therapist. Not exactly a masterpiece since the theme doesn't allow such ecstasy but a good film anyway, one of the best we have seen this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

3 Oscar acting Nominations for sure.,"This is easily one of the best films of the year. Overall it has been a terrible year for movies besides a few exceptions. Granted I haven't seen some of the favorites such as ""The Fighter,"" but overall people & the movie industry wonders why they were down in profits? It wasn't because we didn't have money (we had less last year!) it's because the selection for the most part stunk. I predict this film will get a minimum of 6-8 Oscar nominations this year. Colin Firth is about as close to a shoo-in bet for a nomination I'd bet on it if it was in Vegas. Perhaps he will win, but I'm not sure. Geoffrey Rush will get nominated, but I felt that he was in the movie too much to be stuck in the same category as Helena Bonham-Carter (who will also get a Nom.) for Supporting Actor. I usually don't notice musical scores as most of them are completely...well they're just there. I thought this score was excellent. I think it is a shoo-in for Best Picture & should get a Best Director & hopefully screenplay nod as well.My only suggestion is that most kids under the age of 21 won't appreciate it & find it boring. That's fine but when you're tired of watching Garbage like the ""Step Up"" movies or have to watch stuff explode over and over & it is completely devoid of a plot, come back to this.

Superb movie in all respects,"Our local newspaper printed an article by the movie reviewer of that paper and in the article he praised this film and went on to say how popular it was with Baby Boomers, the people that the movie industry had forgotten, generally, since the '70s. I could not agree more with him; the animated stuff that passes as film in Hollywood is and has been awful. This film is just the opposite of those silly mind-numbing Disney studio time-wasters that call themselves ""movies"" today.I was particularly impressed by the excellent direction by Tom Hooper; as I watched, trying to absorb the story, I was continually struck by his direction: the camera angle, the camera elevation, the subtle blending of camera distances (they melded very softly, one into another, without jumping). The set direction was equally excellent with the move from one set into another very masterful even though the range was quite large (rich to not so).The acting was superb: Rush played the Australian perfectly: his character was on new ground dealing with English Royalty and maintaining that Australian ""everyman ease"" knowing full well the changes needed but holding back just enough to jolt those ""above"" him and cause discomfort to both sides. Colin Firth plays a remarkable role as the king who needs the Australian but who finds difficulty in accepting help; the tension between all parties makes for a movie that (highest accolade) will be remembered for many years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Stupendous,"I offer this film as evidence that 2010 was NOT an awful year for movies. Whether you consider Colin Firth's Oscar-worthy performance (and if he doesn't win for this film, I don't know what the man will need to do in order to finally garner an Oscar), Geoffrey Rush's inspired and brilliant portrayal of a freelance, unconventional speech therapist with a profound understanding of the psychological roots of speech disorders, Helena Bonham Carter's outstanding turn as Firth's wife, the incredibly well-written screenplay, or the overall production values of ""The King's Speech,"" this film ranks among the finest cinematic portrayals of the power of friendship. Firth, as ""Bertie,"" the second son of King George V of England, must assume the throne after his brother abdicates in order to marry the divorcée, Wallis Simpson (an American, no less). In addition to battling his brother's popularity even after his abdication (as Firth's character notes, most monarchs throughout history succeeded a dead predecessor), Bertie must also master a very non-regal stammer that has plagued him throughout life—and he must tackle these obstacles as England stands on the brink of WWII. This he accomplishes with the assistance of Lionel Logue (played by Rush), a commoner (and an Aussie, no less) with outlandish methods and a rather modern conception of equality—he refuses to call King George VI anything other than Bertie, a nickname used only by family members, and he insists that the King call him Lionel, not Doctor Logue. I cannot attest to the film's historical accuracy, but its depiction of friendship is powerful and endearing. This is a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"The King, the voice of England","¨If I am King, where is my power? Can I declare war? Form a government? Levy a tax? No! And yet I am the seat of all authority because they think that when I speak, I speak for them.¨ Being a good public speaker is a necessity for the King of England, because he represents the voice of his nation. If that nation is going through a dark period in time (declaring War on Nazi Germany for example), then the need to be a strong public speaker is even greater. Unfortunately for King George VI that is not the case, since he is known as King George the stammer. Bertie (the nickname his family has given him) has suffered from a severe stammering problem for as long as he can remember. He has tried every means necessary to get over his problem, but they've all failed and there is nothing he can do about it. The King's Speech is the favorite film to take home the Oscar for Best Picture with 12 nominations. Tom Hooper did an excellent job with the direction of this historical drama, which also manages to produce several laughs throughout the film thanks to a witty script written by David Seidler and great performances from Colin Firth (frontrunner to take home the Oscar for Best leading Actor), Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter. David Seidler actually suffered from stammering as a kid and clearly remembered the speech the King gave while declaring War against Germany during World War II. His experience with the problem and memory of the historical facts made him the ideal person to write the script for The King's Speech, since he was mostly only known for writing movies made for television. This film will probably open many new doors for him as a writer because the script was beautifully written and the Oscar nomination was well deserved.Colin Firth gives one of the best performances of the year in his role as King George VI. The film is based on true events beginning in 1925 when his character has to give a public speech in Wembley Stadium. George is only a Duke and has to give the speech as a request given to him by his father King George V (Michael Gambon, known for his role as Dumbledore in the Harry Potter franchise). His stammering problem gets even worse as every eye in the stadium is on him and the speech is a complete disaster. It's a good thing Bertie won't be King because that responsibility should fall on his older brother Edward (Guy Pearce). Years pass by and Bertie can't find a way to get over his speaking problem. Every doctor that treats him fails, and his bad temper doesn't help him any either. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) doesn't give up on him however and finds a speech therapist who claims to be able to fix her husband's problem. Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) is a pretty unorthodox doctor, but he forms a strong bond with Bertie, and their unlikely friendship becomes one of the main attractions of the film. Their personalities clash several times, but their relationship grows through time. King George V falls ill and passes away, so Edward becomes King of the nation. Unfortunately for George, Edward is in love with a two time divorcé, Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), and is willing to resign the crown of England just to marry her. The King of England is the head of the Church and therefore it is impossible for him to marry a divorced woman. Edward resigns for love, and the responsibility of the nation falls entirely on King George VI. The timing couldn't have been worse because England is declaring War on Germany and the nation is waiting for the King's speech.It is impossible to remain emotionally detached from the film due to the strong performances from the ensemble cast. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are just phenomenal in this movie, and the pairing of the two make this movie even stronger. When the movie reaches its climatic scene at the end and we are waiting to hear the King's speech, it's just impossible not to feel nervous for Bertie. We want him to succeed after everything that he has gone through. Firth and Rush really made us feel sympathy for their characters and that is what great actors do. As for the director Tom Hooper all I can say is that he was totally in control of his craft and made a strong film. However I still don't consider this his best film. Last year he directed The Damned United, and in my opinion that is a far superior movie which starred Michael Sheen and Timothy Spall as two football coaches. With these two great films in two years, I will keep Tom Hooper under my radar for his upcoming movies. He has proved twice now that he can make powerful pictures. The relationship between Bertie and Lionel isn't the only strong point of the film; Bertie's relationship with his brother Edward is also a key point of the film. Edward is willing to resign the crown for love, but at the same time he is running away from the responsibility of governing a nation in need and leaving that enormous task on George, who happens to be handicapped himself. Well I guess it isn't Edward's fault that they don't let him marry the person he loves, and for that I understand him, and in a way I think George does too. The movie has several things going for it and I highly recommend it. If The King's Speech ends up winning Best Picture, it will be the second time in consecutive years that Guy Pearce is in a movie that takes home the top prize (he was in The Hurt Locker as well).http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

This is one of the most over-hyped films of recent years. Talk about cream cakes and royal stories, it is enough to make me think a royal wedding is in the offing...mmm, could be a film there. The story of George VI and his stammer is well known but was it enough for a film which stretched like elastic until it rebounded. I believe this was a typical 'English' film which played to the 'soft centre'of English sentiment. Was there a moral to this story? George VI was a decent man? His character was moulded by his family history ? He triumphed over adversity ? Nothing special there. And as for the acting, well that was pretty ordinary . In short this film doesn't rank high. One really wonders how it would have rated without the syrupy press reaction and the topicality of the latest royal wedding party. No, if you want to see this story as it should be told, turn to the television version ( of the same name ) black and white archive footage and a non-dressed up commentary.

A must watch!,"Based on the true story of the ascension of King George VI to the throne, The King's Speech is a beautifully crafted docudrama that is bound to touch the average drama loving population with its simplicity in the making and some stellar performances by veteran actors Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter.Lets start off with Helen who plays the queen slipping into her role quite perfectly as the loving mother and wife who is ever more patient and understanding of her husband's problems. She also brings a rare, occasional comical aspect to the movie that makes it more than just some arbitrary movie with a lot of uncontrollable emotions in it.Well if you're not a fan of Geoffrey and Helen then I would suggest watching the movie just to catch Colin's performance as the stuttering Duke of York. I have seen him only in a couple of movies(Bridget Jones Diary not being one of them!) and didn't think of him to be Oscar material till his performance here. Truly there is no one else who could have played the role better with such flair and certainty. It was not just in the stutter but also in his demeanor as a man of royalty that captivated me. As for his on-screen chemistry with Geoffrey Rush, you would enjoy the slow culmination of friendship that takes place between the king and his speech therapist.Lastly, watch it for its originality and subtlety in bringing out the concerns and dangers that Britain faced at the time and showing the crises that the crown had to go through in such difficult times.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

The King's Speech is a good movie,"The King's Speech is a good movie, but that's it, it does not exceed the limit of a video, it has its merits, but when you think about the possibilities and even the possibilities of the cinema, ""the Kings"" does not exceed anything .It is all done on a very shallow scale, a video made to satisfy and respond to the orders of those who asked or even to follow the course of the 2000s, which generated a line of biblio- cinematographic achievements on the reigns, especially the English royalty. Even the performances follow the same rhythm, Colin Firth is fine, but we know of his ability, honestly here, it was not the time to receive his Oscar as best actor.Geoffrey Rush goes further, which is the great relief of the film, his good character, can follow a rhythm of his own, but nothing more than something great, and we know that Rush is an excellent actor.Perhaps this strangeness of being only good is justified by the direction of Tom Hooper, who is more accustomed to television accomplishments, which we can check in ""King ..."", not only because it is a closed script in internal locations, with a lighting Very clear and at the same time very artificial, but mainly for punctuating plans and against plans, a simple work almost lazy that the TV uses to simplify to the maximum and make clear what is talked about and with whom one talks, not opening spaces for Reflections and possibilities.Apart from this the scenarios, especially where we have the presence of the character ""Lionel Logue"", is a clear reference of old age and decomposition that conversely give beauty to the film, however, Hopper (specifically close to the characters seated), abuses in wanting to present Such scenarios with cutouts that even work, but that used too much, tiring and only show that they are there like figurative form of a little explored world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
So much better than expected.

A well made crowd pleaser,"Colin Firth carries off his part well, there's something very regal about him, bad tempered yes, privileged yes, but also sympathetic and undoubtedly a good man, we as the audience are always behind him. Public humiliation is something we can all relate to and it's difficult to watch some of the most awkward moments in the film. His strict upbringing is revealed to border on cruelty and child abuse, the kind of late Victorian 'discipline' dished out on many children which was considered acceptable in the past.The story takes place over a number of years on and off as he revives speech therapy, something I know absolutely nothing about so I can't comment on the accuracy of this part. The royal family is portrayed as being rather odd and dysfunctional and as an audience we can see a great deal of strain and unhappiness at points on the various characters. The relationship between Bertie and his wife. And daughters is portrayed as very sweet and affectionate however. The King George V is shown as a stern father who regards one son as a playboy and scoundrel and the other as a timid wet blanket and failure. Public speaking was of great importance to the royals and there was no hiding away from it. The radio or wireless was exciting new technology in the 1930s and the royal family seized it as an opportunity to address the whole nation at once, something before unthinkable.The focus of the story is very much on the bond and friendship between Bertie and his therapist who later becomes his confident, despite the rigid class boundaries of the day. There is no bad guy or antagonist in the story which was refreshing, though the threat of war and invasion by Nazi Germany is present in the background throughout the second half of the film.In terms of the cinematography the film strikes a nice balance between being both arty yet realistic, the camera movements are smooth, everything is well framed and the lighting of the scenes isn't overdone. With a smallish budget of just $15million the set designs and vintage cars all look very good to my eyes.Of course the story of an underdog overcoming their disadvantages and ultimately triumphing is a real crowd-pleaser and cinema is not short of films of this kind. Slumdog Millionaire, Rocky, Sea Biscuit, The Hobbit and Harry Potter are just a few that spring to mind. If I had a complaint about the film it would probably be that it was marketed as being slightly more funny and upbeat than it actually turned out in the final cut. Also Helena Bonham plays her part a bit too carefree and sassy for me. All the swearing too was also a bit unrealistic and unnecessary.

They almost always become a default for winning the big awards. Just look at the last five years of Oscar history. Without a doubt, ""The King's Speech"" is certain for Oscar bait.I initially went to view this movie so to see if it is really award worthy material. From start to finish, my eyes were glued to screen. This movie is excellent on so many levels. The performances are simply phenomenal. I have never had the privilege in seeing a movie with Colin Firth. His role as King George VI is sublime. Not only does he pull off a good stutter and deliver his lines well, but he puts intense emotion in the character he portrays, whether it be the unyielding fear that he experiences in giving speeches to the anguish he faces within the various tragedies of his family. No doubt, he'll get Best Actor, and rightfully so. Helena Bonham Carter provides warmth and humor as King George's wife. The real genius though is Geoffery Rush. I've seen his mesmerizing work for Shine, and I consider him to be among Europe's most versatile actors. Every second he is on screen in this film, he creates an illumination, whether it be the witty dialog or the advisable council he delivers to the King. I'd give him my vote for Best Supporting Actor.Addition to the brilliant cast, the story itself is unique and the fact that it is based off of diaries and notes from the actual people that are depicted in this film is incredible. David Seidler will definitely get his award for Best Original Screenplay.The film-making talent in this film is flawless. One aspect I can't help but admire is the work of the cinematography. Each shot in this film is composed and lighted beautifully. The costumes and production design is exquisite, the editing crisp, and the sound perfect. Alexandre Desplat's score adds a pretty tune to the film, but the real impact is the use of classical music, which is particularly significant towards the end of the film where the King gives his first WWII speech over the radio. And the directionshall I continue?If I have to say one negative thing about this film, it is the pace. The two-hour film moves more like a three hour film. This is a common thread in bio-pic films since only so much can be covered in a limited time, which makes it hard to choose what to keep and what to toss while trying to keep the audience entertained. This is a hard feat to pull off; nevertheless, my eyes were focused on the screen the whole time.I have not seen many great films this year. ""The King's Speech"" is one of them. Though bio-pic films tend to hog the Oscars, I hope this film does well at the academy.My rating: ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Film That Speaks To Everyone,"The Kings Speech is a film that I honestly think is an achievement, a film about a royal family member with a stammer really shouldn't have been such a compelling and beautiful film to watch but it was. Probably the most common complaint about this film is that it is widely considered to be ""Oscar Bait"" well if that means a beautifully written film with amazing performances that is never boring or dull then that's fine by me because this is a truly fantastic film. The biggest praise I could give this movie is that it legitimately makes you care for its lead character, the film takes the time to show you just how much King George's stammer effected him not only privately with his family but also publicly where you saw the self humiliation he endured and it's all done perfectly. While the beautiful script had a large part in this it was truly Colin Firths magnificent performance that carried this film, through his performance you understand just how much he endured and you feel the fear he felt in taking the crown and his fear in his own voice, Firth won an Oscar for his performance and it was very well deserved. While no one steals the spotlight from Firth there are plenty other performances that truly shined in this film mainly Geoffrey Rush. Rush is just so likable in this film he has fantastic chemistry with Firth but he was also a very well written character, you understood his need to help people, his past was very well developed and added something to his character. Helena Bonham Carter completely departs from her usual work and gives the best performance of her career in this film, she was such a supportive character to Colin Firth she made me legitimately smile in some places when she comforts her husband and doesn't make this film to sad to endure. This film is not all sad and gloomy it's a very uplifting and inspiring film that does have some really good humour to it. Guy Pearce can be a very good actor when he wants to be and he clearly wanted to be in this film because he did a great job in this movie, his character was despicable and Pearce clearly eats it all up and it adds to the torment of Firths character, but my biggest complaint about this film is his character arc, not enough time was taken to truly justify some of the decisions his character makes and didn't feel earned when he made them.This is a performance piece, this film relies entirely on its lead performances and there was not a bad one in sight, this film is inspirational an uplifting, Colin Firth is incredible in the film and will not stop reiterating how impressed I was at how compelling this film was.91%/A",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Truly awful,"It is impossible to take this awful, badly acted rubbish seriously in any way, not least because Colin Firth looks and sounds absolutely NOTHING like King George VI at all. In any case the story is completely unimportant since George VI was just an irrelevant figurehead without any power at all, very much like every British monarch since William IV.By starting World War II the UK destroyed itself and became an American satellite, as the Suez Crisis proved. Funny how the UK only declared war on Germany in 1939 - even though Germany and the Soviet Union both invaded Poland at the same time! Everybody knew this had been arranged in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in August.If they were going to make this film they should have at least cast somebody who even vaguely resembled the actual monarch. Hugh Grant turned this film down, with make up he could have been made to resemble George - unlike Colin Firth who is horrendously miscast and gives his usual talentless performance. Michael Gambon is much too heavy to play his father King George V, but at least he isn't as badly cast as the lead.It was really worth the UK starting World War II, just so it would bankrupt itself and hand over all of eastern Europe - including Poland - to the Soviets for the next 50 years. It's funny how people don't seem to realise that the Blitz happened because the RAF was bombing civilian cities in Germany.0/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A truly inspiring historical drama,"Cinema, both in Britain and America, has long had a fascination with the kings and queens of England. From Shakespeare's historical plays to the struggles between the Royalists and Parliamentarians in the English Civil War to the many films about the Tudors, countless movies have focused on the lives and deeds of the Royal Family. Compared to these tales, the story of how a new king learned to overcome a speech impediment might seems somewhat underwhelming, and perhaps not the best material for a major feature film. And yet director Tom Hooper and writer David Seidler have turned it into one of the best films of 2011.For one thing, a lot more is riding on George the VI learning to speak than you might guess at first. As king, he is expected to be the voice of his people. If he stammers on the airwaves, it won't just be him who looks weak, but the entire nation and its empire. Plus, given the circumstances surrounding his ascension to the throne, his popularity is far from universal; one misstep and his subjects could lose faith in him entirely. And most importantly, his nation is on the verge of war with the Third Reich. Now, perhaps more than ever, it is vital that England and its leaders give off their strongest image.More importantly to the film's success, it's not just about a man learning to speak in public. It's about the relationship between him and the man teaching him how to do it. It's a relationship with a less than auspicious beginning. Prince Albert, Duke of York, second in the line of succession, has had it with speech therapists, and is in no mood to put up with some commoner who constantly provokes him and demands to be treated as an equal. At many points he threatens to break off the treatment entirely. But as Logue's methods start to pay off, their patient-doctor relationship grows into a most unlikely yet extremely deep and long lasting friendship.As sappy as this may sound, in reality it's truly uplifting to watch two men from completely different backgrounds, and with so little in common, form a bond of trust and respect that will last a lifetime and strengthen both of them. And it's equally inspiring to see how a failed Shakespearean actor who's too poor to heat his offices or higher a secretary could be the one to help a king find his voice. And The King's Speech is also frequently humorous, nowhere more so than when Logue shows 'Bertie' that cursing cures a stammer, which is certainly why the film received an R rating.And of course the acting is exceptional. As the king's wife, Helena Bonham Carter manages to be perfectly cultured and ladylike, yet also assertive, independent, and even a bit devious, in the best possible meaning of the word. Guy Pearce, as older brother Edward VIII, effortlessly gives of the air of a spoiled, irresponsible fop without taking it into the realm of caricature. And Geoffrey Rush, in the role of Lionel Logue, is lovably eccentric yet serious, even intense when need be. And there's a spark of life in his eyes, an irrepressible sense of humor just beneath the surface in most scenes, the exception being when it's on full display.But it's Colin Firth in the title role who's the star of the show. I've heard that faking a stammer is one of the hardest challenges in acting. If true, then on this alone Firth deserved his best actor Oscar. His opening speech at the horse track was simply painful to watch. And when listening to his (much improved) speech at the end, then to the actual speech from George VI, it would be near impossible to tell them apart if not for the difference in sound quality. What's more, he exudes a sense of determination and duty so powerful that you can feel it. And when he gets mad, oh does he ever get mad. Every emotion he's asked to carry out is done perfectly.It will probably put small children to sleep (and teach them some words parents prefer they not know) and anyone looking for action and excitement should look elsewhere, but for any fan of highbrow cinema, The King's Speech is an absolute must see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
George could have used the Public Speaking class that I recently took,"So here it is. The movie that might finally win Colin Firth an Oscar (I'm certainly rooting for him)*. I had actually never known about King George VI's stutter until ""The King's Speech"" came out. Firth brings the character to life brilliantly. The viewer really comes to understand what it must have been like for this man, mildly ostracized within his extended family, to suddenly have to lead his country and the empire while Europe marched irreversibly towards another war.Plenty of fine support comes from the other cast members. Geoffrey Rush plays Lionel Logue, who gives George the speech lessons. Helena Bonham Carter plays the tolerant but frustrated Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Also starring are Guy Pearce as Edward VIII, Michael Gambon as George V, Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill, Jennifer Ehle as Myrtle Logue, Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Claire Bloom as Queen Mary. But without a doubt, the movie belongs to Firth. He brings the same flair to this role that he brought to that of the closeted homosexual professor in ""A Single Man"" last year.Does the movie have any drawbacks? Well, maybe the concept of a monarchy IS a little hard to justify, especially considering how widespread the poverty in England was. And clearly the movie took some liberties with accuracy. But overall, this is definitely a movie that I recommend.*Colin Firth looks likely to win for this one, much like how Helen Mirren won for playing Elizabeth II in ""The Queen"" four years ago. Maybe people have to quadrennially play members of the House of Windsor to ensure Oscar wins.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Sublime adaption of a real story with well written script, sublime acting and a moody, truly accurate production design. Truly Powerful! 'I HAVE A VOICE!'","This is a powerful, hilarious and deeply moving story, told against the backdrop of a critical juncture in modern history, of the emergence of a deep friendship out of a professional relationship between two men who would otherwise never have socially interacted. The screenplay, written by David Seidler (who also wrote Tucker: The Man and his Dream), is excellent. The dry British wit is hilarious. Tom Hooper (Elizabeth I) does a superb job directing this movie.The acting was just more than SUBLIME. During the watch I was constantly amazed how much I could relate to the characters - they displayed their emotional landscapes so believable and well. The buildup to the climactic finale is skillfully executed. Geoffrey Rush (Elizabeth: The Golden Age) does a fantastic job as Lionel Logue and Colin Firth (A Single Man) is excellent as King George VI.Personally, I really enjoyed the MOOD of the film. This was of course done by acting, but also the VISUALITY: Cinematography does its part by using many unbalanced shots to portray the tension, insecurity and struggle of George VI or the relationship between Lionel and George VI... this framing tells the emotional problems even without the dialogue... and combined WITH the script / dialogue these scenes are extremely strong! Also, I am VERY much in love with the set design and locations. Eve Stewart (production designer) managed to create a very well done period movie where all the props, sets, walls, furniture.. everything feels so RIGHT (in an interview: They researched the periods so deeply they just 'knew' it by heart. One can tell by watching!). This production design shows in every detail the social and political pressure, the emotional struggles between depressed hopelessness and coming-of-age (somehow) to an individual voice.
The 'normal' viewer who does not pay attention to these details will not 'see' them... but feel them. This is what brilliant production design does: showing the essence of the character's story... without you realizing it.Some background info that made the film even better for me:
It turns out that David Seidler also had a stuttering problem as a child and drew inspiration from the king's struggle. Early in his career he wanted to write a screenplay about it. He dutifully asked the Queen Mother for permission. She agreed but told him ""not in my lifetime"". Little did he know she would live to be 101 and he would have to wait another 30 years. Another interesting tidbit we learned was that near the end of the shoot, the crew finally located one of Lionel Logue's grandsons, who just so happened to live about 10 minutes away from the director. They got access to Lionel's diaries and correspondence and managed to incorporate some of it into the script.A 'real-life-story' adaption of it's own kind. It was deep, well-researched, well executed. Wow!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Charming insight into the personal troubles of the royal family,"Due to the hype surrounding it, it's almost impossible to critically review the film. 12 Oscar nominations is a good indicator of quality- you can't really argue against that, can you? But despite the hype, I've managed to formulate some sort of critical opinion.The King's Speech is unashamedly a crowd pleaser. After the death of his father and the abdication of his brother Edward, the Duke of York, or ""Bertie"" as Lionel calls him, must take his place on the throne and become King George VI. Unfortunately he is plagued by a speech impediment. Will he overcome it with the help of unconventional failed actor Lionel Logue? Will Logue also help him to overcome his personal troubles? I think you know the answer.So, did Colin Firth deserve his Oscar nomination? Watching his performance, he deserves to win (and the odds are that he'll do so). Firth's attempt at a stammer could easily have come off as ridiculous but it is painfully convincing. Every time you hear Bertie choke as he tries to speak, you can't help but wince and hope that the adorable emotionally crippled duke will not only overcome his speech impediment, but will finally escape from the shadow of his older brother. And the parallel between Bertie's stepping up to the throne and Colin Firth stepping up to collect his first Oscar is just too brilliant to ignore. Just like George VI's public, we are all expecting a great speech.Helena Bonham Carter does well as the Duchess of York. Did she deserve an Oscar nomination? As Bertie's loving supportive wife, she's certainly a good supporting actress. Really, she should have won Best Actress for her stunning performance in Wings of the Dove and so I have no complaints if she scoops Best Supporting Actress this year.The final acting nomination is for Geoffery Rush as Best Supporting Actor. The bromance between Lionel and Bertie (for those who aren't familiar with modern teenage slang, ""bromance"" is a loving platonic relationship between two men) is key to the film and again, Rush offers good support. ""Support"" is the key word- although Firth is the lead, this is definitely an ensemble film. It's hard to fault any of the performances.I'm hardly going to go through and judge whether The King's Speech deserves to win all 12 Oscars, but it deserves the 12 nominations. This is a well-made film and it's suitably British enough to be a strong contender for winning Best Picture. It may be wonderfully populist Oscar bait, but it's so easy to fall in love with the film that you won't care.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Well deserved for Firth,"Colin Firth has been in this industry for years, decades in fact but only now is he delivering outstanding performances. He deserved his Oscar. For the film itself, while good, doesn't leave you with that feeling of a mystical awe. Lifting story no doubt. The running time is spot on because watching Firth stutter for two hours can leave you tired.Geoffry Rush was another who deserves an applause. Playing as the commoner Aussie, he enables Viewers to cling themselves to some emotional knot. The relationship between a king and a commoner is a intriguing one and most importantly makes you feel for King George because quite frankly, i don't really give a damn about the monarch today. If Rush played a rich tutor then this film would of fallen flat on it face.If there was one reason to watch this film, then it for Colin Firth's culminating performance. Inspiring and a delight to the eyes, The King Speech is worth watching",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Brilliant character study,"This account of the life and times of King George VI of the United Kingdom, centered around his stammer, is directed with shameless sentimentality by Tom Hooper (The Damned United). But so long as it is done with this kind of candidness and art of narration, you can get away with far more mush than this. More than anything, The King's Speech is a brilliant character study, with Colin Firth's masterful work as King George VI at the centre of events. He conveys the king's combination of vulnerability and courage in an immensely sympathetic performance. Add to that the technical achievement with the speech part of the role, and you have a worthy Oscar winner.Alongside Firth, Geoffrey Rush gives a fine performance as King George's speech therapist and friend, and it is in this budding friendship much of the film's warmth and humour is based. It is a lenient and uncritical buddy portrayal, but through backdropping this against the most important historical events during the film's time-span, notably the death of King George V, Edward's abdication and the outbreak of WWII, Hooper finds a suitable balance between the amiable and the momentous. And this is the real genius of The King's Speech; the way George's personal struggle is being put into context and given consequence. As a result, the film is able to retain a high level of suspense as George and Lionel Logue team up in the king's private radio studio to broadcast his first motivational wartime speech, concluding an inspirational story, filled with humanity and insight, about an in some ways ordinary and in other ways extraordinary man.*Review written in 2011.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A sure-fire Oscar nomination,"Having read reviews of this film soon after its release, I knew I had to see it. Best decision I've made in a while. The characterisation of the main players, esp Helena BC, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush is first class with performances which should rightly earn each an Oscar nomination at least. The production design is so evocative of the time with homes in the style I remember from my childhood accurately recreated.Firth's reserved then occasionally uninhibited manner while working with Logue is a masterpiece of acting but it is also hard to decide which of the two is bringing out the best in the other, they are so well matched. Top marks for casting. There are few if any 'exciting' scenes but it would be hard not to feel a welling of emotion as the future king stumbles towards his potentially catastrophic major speech announcing the start of war with Germany. Even as he delivers it, Logue (Rush) is coaching him with his unconventional style. The result is heartwarming and undeniably realistic (a typically British rather than American finale, if that makes sense).Cannot recommend this film too highly. Music is great too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The awards speak for themselves,This film deserves all the high praise it has been given.

Touching real story,"It is the non-fiction drama about the British king, who has been suffered by the stammer, and how he overcomes this difficulty.I think it is remarkably interesting in that it is created on the basis of the true story. It is common success story of the king, who experiences a series of setbacks and who finally gets over from his fear of dressing people, but given it is not a miracle but the outcomes of his painstaking efforts, you'll be motivated to put forward without terrifying making a mistake.Moreiver, it also describes the relationship between king and his teacher, a professional of linguistic medication. It is emotional that they are gradually building a beautiful relationship of mutual trust.In short, it will touch your heart in spite of its simple story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

I must confess I'm not very fond of History, Biographical movies, but this one really stands out. Really worth seeing. I couldn't finish this review without referring to the amazing Firth-Rush impeccable performances.

The gift of cinema does credit to the gift of speech.,"The King's Speech is directed by Tom Hooper and written by David Seidler. It stars Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Timothy Spall, Derek Jacobi & Michael Gambon. Music is by Alexandre Desplat and photography is by Danny Cohen. The idea for the film came about after Seidler read about how King George VI (Firth) overcame his stammer after a friendship was formed with his voice coach Lionel Logue (Rush). Having himself overcome a stutter problem in his youth, Seidler set about writing his story from informed information. A bonus came before filming started when notebooks belonging to Logue were put forward for use. These enabled Seidler to incorporate works from the books into the screenplay. Plot picks up just prior to George's brother, Edward (Pearce), abdicating the throne, thus thrusting the stammering George on to the hottest seat in England. With World War looming, George will be needed to make the speech of speeches to becalm his nation, but first he must work closely with the affable Logue and hope it brings an end to his vocal woes.I first viewed The King's Speech just a couple of days before the Academy Awards that year, so I didn't know how it was going to perform there. It would garner the Academy Award for Best Picture, Best Director (Hooper), Best Actor (Firth) and Best Original Screenplay (Seidler), with 12 nominations in total. This was a year when Oscar and BAFTA (where it won 7 of the 14 categories it was nominated for - including Best Film and Best Actor for Colin Firth) got things right. The film at that time I watched it had already made over $230 million in profit, which was a figure guaranteed to rise considerably since the film was still playing to packed theatres in the UK (which was indeed the case as the last figure put forward was $412 million).I myself ventured to the theatre on 22nd February 2011, which was over 6 weeks after it was first released in its homeland. As I approached the cinema I saw there was a queue! A queue? I haven't queued to get into a film since the halcyon days of Jaws, Star Wars and Close Encounters of the Third Kind! I noticed there was many youngsters in this line, so of course they were going to see the Yogi Bear movie, or that Gnomeo & Juliet film, Surely? Not so actually. In they went to see The King's Speech, an audience that ranged from 12 years of age to the fragile OAP day trippers. For the next two hours the only sounds I heard were that of laughter, hushed words of praise for what was on the screen, and even sobs during some of the more tender moments within. No mobile phones, no chitter chatter about acne or the boy next door, just an across the board appreciation for expert film making.There in is the reason why The King's Speech coined it in at the box office and broke merry records as it went on its way. It has universal appeal, a film without tricks, just a simple involving story acted supremely by a cast of bona fide thespians. It beats a true heart, whilst doling out a visual history lesson to those so inclined to matters of the British Monarchy and the political upheaval about to surface as Adolf started his surge. Even for a film so chocked full of dialogue and basic human interactions, the pace is brisk and never sags, the quieter reflective moments only bringing anticipation of the next enjoyable scene. When all is said and done, The King's Speech success snowballed because of word of mouth, it started out as an intended independent picture, to be shown in selected theatres only, and now it holds up as one of the best films of 2010/2011. Believe me, believe the hype, that if you still haven't seen it then you owe it to yourself to see this beautiful movie. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The Making of a King,"In 1925 King George V asks his second son, Albert, the Duke of York (Colin Firth), to give the closing speech of the Empire Exhibition in Wembley Stadium, London. The Duke's stammer ensures that he will fail wretchedly. In 1934 (the next scene), he is treated by a portly – and maybe a quack – speech therapist in the baggiest trousers you ever saw; his tailor must have come from Pillsbury. Anyway, the analyst encourages the Duke to smoke as he says it will relax him and give him confidence. Hmmm  He also presents the royal personage with seven sterilized ice cubes to hold into his mouth while he is supposed to read from a text. Gagging, the poor Duke fails miserably. And so we are introduced to the movie's theme: the treatment of the future king's speech impediment.Now the Duke's brother, the Duke of Windsor (Guy Pearce), the heir apparent, obviously has character flaws that hinge against his kingly leadership. Worse, he wants to marry twice divorced American commoner Wallis Simpson (Eve Best). But as the King of England is also the Defender of the Faith (Church of England), there is a dichotomy, to say the least. The Church opposes remarriage if a former spouse is still alive. And the royals and empire peoples would not accept it. Furthermore, the British government, including the Prime Minister, would resign, forcing a crisis and general elections. Hey, Duke of Windsor, can't you find just one young and attractive lass in the empire to be a king's wife? Anyway, upon the death of the Duke's authoritative father King George V (Michael Gambon) in 1936 and the abdication of the throne later that year by King Edward VIII (former Duke of Windsor), Albert becomes king.Along the way Duke is tenderly supported by his loyal wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) and is treated secretly by Australian speech therapist (and failed actor), Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who does not have the proper credentials but has the experience to make his untraditional treatment work. Logue's methods are unorthodox, to say the least. But he does notice that the future king does not stammer when he sings or swears. He obtains further clues when investigating the king's background. There is the matter of protocol that one must keep when dealing with royalty: Logue calls the future king ""Bertie."" Over the years the two testy characters will go through a rather difficult relationship as they bicker on the treatment and have periods where they disconnect. It makes for uncomfortable situations. Eventually they overcome their class differences and personality quirks to have their friendship prosper for the rest of their lives. The picture ends in September 1939, when King George VI must deliver his first war address to his people and rally them against the threat of Adolph Hitler, whose troops had just invaded Poland and begun World War II in Europe. The Fuhrer had long ago mastered the art of public speaking. With the help of Logue he is successful.This is an actor's picture, and succeeds well. Some may find it uninteresting, as they will compare dramatic monarchical movies from Great Britain's remarkable history (like ""The Lion in Winter,"" ""Richard III,"" or ""A Man for All Seasons"") to a picayune plot involving a speech impediment of a king. But Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush can act. The era is pictured well by interior stage sets, and the film is entertaining. ""The King's Speech"" even won the Oscar for the Best Picture of the Year.Postscript: King George died in 1952. His oldest daughter, Elizabeth, succeeded him and rules as of this writing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A sensitive and intimate treatment of a pivotal moment in history,"Whilst out and out Royalists will love this film, even republicans and socialists with a heart will be touched by the portrayal of a man with a crippling disability overcoming seemingly impossible tasks.Colin Firth portrays the heir apparent with tremendous sensitivity, communicating a genuine fear of the crown and all it means for him and his family, whilst battling with his sense of duty to do what is right for his country. It would have been easy for Firth to come across as a comical and derided figure. The harder task was for him to show the strength of character needed to overcome such a disability in a position that made no allowances, whilst at the same time nurturing the sympathy and loyalty of the audience.In every scene she is present Helen Bonham-Carter exudes love, devotion and fierce protection for her husband and father of her children. It is this relationship, so intimately portrayed, that shows the strength the hesitant King draws upon. This champion of the institution is nevertheless prepared to stretch the boundaries of royal custom to seek unorthodox remedies for her husbands affliction.Geoffrey Rush is outstanding as that unorthodox remedy (Logue) and the scenes featuring Logue and the King generate moments of light humour. During the most serious tests of the monarchy, Britain and Empire the contribution of Rush's character to the ability of the King to discharge his duty cannot be understated. As the pressure on the King builds towards the vitally important Kings Speech, Logue becomes a friend and confidante to the holder of one of the loneliest jobs in the world.Firth, Rush, Hooper and Seidler all deserve the highest praise for this thoroughly moving and enjoyable film. If they don't get an Oscar out of this I suspect there is still some residual bitterness in the American Colonies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Frivolous,"SPOILER WARNINGThis is one of the most frivolous movies I've ever seen. The film tries to be deep sometimes, but the fact is that it's just a shallow story about the speech problem of one of England's kings...I don't live in a monarchic country, so perhaps that's the reason I didn't understand the meaning of the king's speech problem. I mean, he could have made his radio speeches recorded and edited. If he didn't have problems having someone taking staged photos of him, I don't see why he just couldn't have his speeches recorded and fixed.The acting and dialogue was well done, but the story is so shallow to me that I think this is a completely forgettable movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A good looking Film becomes a Great Biographical and the reason lies in the title..,"The King's Speech (2010) :
Brief Review -A good looking Film becomes a Great Biographical and the reason lies in the title. I just learnt that how a just another simple looking good film can become a Great film with the correct use of USP factors in the climax. That 5 minutes 'Speech' (as i referred) in the climax takes this flick on next level and subsequently continues the flow for next 3 minutes to end the film on nothing short to a 'Classic' note. The King's Speech is a biographical drama about King George VI, his impromptu ascension to the throne of the British Empire in 1936, and the speech therapist who helped the unsure monarch overcome his stammer. The film begins on a promising note and carries the essential functions for almost 100 minutes but by that time it never looks like a great film at all. Then, the the Best is saved for the last and the result is amusing. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush take charge from the first frame and never loses it, not even in your mind when the film is finished. Colin deserved that Oscar but i wonder why Mr. Rush didn't win it? He was sublime. 3rd best act comes from fair chick Helena Bonham Carter who looks exactly like a Milk white European Queen. Art direction and cinematography are impressive. The Background Score in last 10 minutes is fantabulous. It just makes that scene look like water flowing smoothly in River. Tom Hooper's conviction and story-telling deserves all the praise because he kept patience, he was in no hurry and didn't lose the functional crafting he had in mind. And the impact is awesome. It is arguable whether this film deserved Oscars or not but is it not at all arguable whether the film is Good or not. It is a Classic for me and even in the worst case it is anything that is close to a Classic.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Winning Film,"Tom Hooper's The King's Speech (2010) stands as my favorite film of the Oscar season. I would maybe even go to say it is my favorite film of the year. After the death of King George V (Michael Gamdon) and the abdication of King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce), Bertie (Colin Firth) a.k.a King George VI must ascend to the throne and overcome the struggle of his awful stammer in order to prove himself as a strong, confident king. To do so, he hires Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a failed actor and spirited speech therapist, who, with unique methods, must help Bertie successfully deliver an inspiring radio-address. This period piece is amazingly uplifting. Bertie carries himself courageously and is an easy hero to identify with. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll pinch the person sitting next to you if Bertie screws it up! It is brilliantly written and performed. Colin Firth gives an incredible performance. With the stammer attached to that child- like face, one couldn't help but sympathize with this man every time he speaks. No doubt, he will be taking home the Oscar this year for 'Best Actor in a Leading Role'. Simply put, The King's Speech is a great story and a joy to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A course in oratory,"Isn't it funny how the various members of the royal family are expected to be perfect human beings, knowledgeable, social and articulate? What lies behind this notion is revealed in Tom Hooper's wonderful film in a fascinating and brilliant way.Having become interested in the dynamics of the royal family after the death of Prince Philip and, most recently, Queen Elizabeth, this film was a personal must-see for me.At a time when words have lost their value, when speeches by politicians quickly disappear into amnesia, this film shows the contrary of time's past.The film culminates in the titular speech, made memorable thanks to Firth's poignant performance as well as the use of Beethoven's 7th. With every word and every string of music, the weight of the story itself is felt in a way that is at once terrifying and epic.The cinematography of this film is aesthetically pleasing throughout.Granted, the film does take some liberties, especially with chronology and behavior. But that is unavoidable.As a dramatic work of art, this film is unquestionably first rate. I enjoyed it very much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

It makes someone who may seem untouchable and unrelatable as most royalty can be more relatable and causes you to be sympathetic to their cause.Not a bad actor in the bunch, not a bad word or line written in the whole move and the direction is perfect.

Undeniably Deserving of the Oscar It Won,"2010 was quite the year in film, if not for filmmakers themselves, then for me; of the ten Best Picture nominated movies of the new decade, I have seen six. Though sixty percent may seem low to some, I assure you that, even for a film fanatic like myself, this is a relatively high number. Accordingly, I cannot speak for 'The Social Network', 'The Fighter', 'Winter's Bone', or 'True Grit'--at least not yet, though the former two are on my movie 'Watch List'. However, the remaining six are a different story.Now, at the time of its win, I had not yet seen 'The King's Speech'. I was too young for it; I was too uninterested in it; I was too concerned with other movies to see it. The idea behind the film seemed a bit tedious, a bit long-winded, no pun intended--I knew nothing about King George VI and his struggles, nor did I much care to.Last summer, I finally rented the movie upon the recommendation of my father and others. By this point, I was a fan of both Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter, and was sure, even if the movie was not for me, that they would make the film at least bearable. They definitely delivered, as did the movie.I'm not exactly sure what it was I expected from the film. Be it great acting, excellent cinematography, well-structured plot, whatever--it resonated with me. Colin Firth's stutter was not only convincing, but emotional--you could feel his frustration and his pain in his words. Spatially, the cinematography succeeded admirably. As with another Firth film, 'A Single Man', the color scheme was muted considerably to match the mood of the picture, rightfully so. There is a much longer list of compliments about this film somewhere in my brain, but I won't list them all.Fantastic. But deserving of the Oscar? The academy thought so, and I have to agree. 'Inception' was too flashy, reliant mostly on CGI to tell its story; 'Black Swan' was too unbelievably intense; 'The Kids Are All Right' was too filled with unnecessary dramatics projected by an only somewhat sensible betrayal; 'Toy Story 3' was too contrived, forced into a franchise that did not need such a definite ending. '127 Hours' was a winner most people would not be angry over, though it was too one- note in comparison to the actual winner.'The King's Speech' wasn't 'too' anything. It was, on the surface, the story of one important man's struggle with speech. Below that, however, it was so much more: in Bertie's problems with speech lie problems with identity, because language and communication lay the brickwork for identity, but what if said brickwork is flawed? What happens to that identity in such a case--is it erased, ruined? This film highlighted that struggle among a strong friendship and equally heartwarming and heartbreaking scenes. It was a movie that championed in multiple areas, instead of just one or two.This is not to say that the other Oscar-nominated films of 2010 were necessarily bad movies; they simply paled in comparison to 'The King's Speech'. 'The King's Speech' was a film that succeeded; it was a film that left one feeling satisfied with the time and money they spent; it was a film that will hold up for generations to come. And that is sufficient criteria for a Best Picture-winning movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Despite royal focus, universal message humanizes ""The King's Speech""","Compelling figures make for compelling drama. Compelling characters who feel ordinary make for award-worthy drama. The script that David Seidler assembled into ""The King's Speech"" using purely research taps into a story that's simply gold: a British monarch, whom we are accustomed to view as having an inherent infallibility, with a speech impediment that makes him seem just as human as any of us. Director Tom Hooper might be relatively new to the game, but he understands his film's fundamental core — that we all have an impediment about which we are self-conscious, that plants seeds of self-doubt — and he seizes that empathy to create a universally delightful film.Hooper also must've had a bit of fortune to work with a production crew this keen. ""The King's Speech"" is dressed in pristine fashion. From set direction down to costumes, there's a surprising amount of beauty in every shot and so much to appreciate about the effort gone into creating pre-World War II England. Standing at the center of it all as the subject of this art piece is Colin Firth, who did so similarly in last year's ""A Single Man"" for which he was also nominated for an Oscar.Firth plays Prince Albert (""Bertie""), the Duke of York, who went on to become King George VI after his father died and his elder brother abdicated. Developing a stammer at a young age, he preferred to stay out of the spotlight. As he grew older and had a family with wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) and duty called, he needed to overcome it to be able to lead his people. Presented with the challenge of playing a proud figure of regality with a damning flaw, Firth succeeds through and through. Between himself and Hooper's direction, we are successfully led to identify on a personal level with this character of royalty. Yet as much as King George becomes humanized, Firth also captures that slight regal self-importance, that sense of what separates him from us, and in doing so he creates a fantastically rounded character. Bonham Carter follows suit: she presents Elizabeth as mostly wife, one concerned for yet incredibly supportive of her husband. Her priority is to show a sensible, humbled and relatable woman first, then a duchess/queen second.To connect us to the characters and story, Hooper zooms in and out of various levels of storytelling. Sometimes we are one with the king, feeling his emotions or at times literally seeing what he's seeing. Sometimes we take a step back from that, but still within the royal family's trusted circle, analyzing the characters by microscope. Occasionally it's a bit more passive as the story takes a more political turn. In the few instances when ""The King's Speech"" dulls, it's usually when that lens is in place. The story works best when its most personal, when we connect with it.Mostly that's whenever Geoffrey Rush graces the screen. As an Australian-born speech therapist with no medical credentials, Rush's Lionel Logue makes for the only ""commoner"" in the entire film. Although his methods are unorthodox and he has a terrific sense of humor, Rush transcends the ""quirky genius doctor"" type, as he understands the complexity of Logue's relationship with the king: the conflicting desire to be both humble before his majesty as well as an effective speech coach. The tension here derives from a fundamental difference in belief: whereas Bertie sees speech as a physical obstacle, Logue understands its roots are deeply psychological and tied into his personal matters. Naturally, a man of royalty would have trouble expressing private thoughts to a ""common"" man, but Logue breaks his shell, slowly but surely.In part, Logue gets the King of England to understand the importance of his voice as a symbol, as the foremost expression of individuality and as something he's entitled to possess and express. Although a king feels the strain of this importance hundred-fold, that message has value to everyone. Perhaps that theme seems elementary, but ""The King's Speech"" is brilliant because we experience it, we come to see that on our own in watching sublime actors humanize royal characters and a director who captures that humanity.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Long Live The King's Speech!,"Colin Firth. Need I say more? If I DO, then go see this movie and you'll agree he is one of the finest actors around. But there's no one in this film that isn't wonderful: Helena Bonham Carter, Timothy Spall, Michael Gambon, and Derek Jacobi (who practically cornered the market on stuttering himself by playing both Claudius and Alan Turing) to name but a few. The actors manage to affectionately recall their real-life counterparts without aping them. On a par with Firth is the brilliant Geoffrey Rush, and Australian playing an Australian. Despite being a 'root for the underdog' scenario, the script nicely manages to skirt cliché and be warm, witty and restrained - all at the same time. In the past, the Queens of Great Britain have gotten their fair share of screen time (Elizabeth is a mere child here), so it is refreshing and enlightening to see its Kings so wonderfully illuminated.

"My 360th Review: Superb, Entertaining, and A Real Film","In an age of cookie cutter movies this stands out by a mile.With acting rather than action to the fore this is a masterclass is good production, great acting, and clear directorship.The story is both funny, accurate, and moving and records in detail the amazing transition of George from stuttering misfit to regal ruler with humility, humour, and a good lack of hubris.Above all this is film. It is captivating, the performances and the film meld together to take you to another place and it is always fun and interesting when history is so well captured and reproduced.It is, above all, refreshing to see a film that is original and entertaining. Some have complained it is over-sentimental - we didn't get that at all - I think rather it captures well the spirit of the British at that time - there is a sense of reserve in the film that lifts it to another level.With superb performances and very confident direction this is, quite simply, a wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Kings Speech fantastic film based on historical events.,"A tale of an unlikely friendship between King and Speech therapist, and a masterclass of acting between a triumvirate of actors. Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter's performances are so entertaining and are the highlight of the film for. The interactions between the king and speech therapist, alongside the King's wife is so engaging. A clever jump for the film was the large swerve that the film takes on the story that loomed over the whole period, which was World War II. The film cleverly keeps it at a distance while zooming in on the characters and their interactions and delivers a smart, thoughtful and brilliant exploration of character interactions that bring out humanity.

The King's Speech rules!,"Hail to ""The King's Speech""! This is a triumphant and empowering movie about determination, courage, resiliency, leadership, but most of all friendship. For those of you have not heard ""The King's Speech"", let me voice out the narrative for you. The film centers around King George VI of Britain's struggle with his speech impediment. The studerness of King George VI brings in the help of an unconventional but wily Speech Therapist, Lionel Louge. Director Tom Hooper is commended for not making the speech impediment as the sole narrative voice of ""The King's Speech"". The friendship between a lifelong lonely boy & man born into monarchy with a vivacious & clever family man who happens to have a gift in propelling others to reach their zenith provides the film its most entertaining & magnetic components; and that is what I loved the most of ""The King's Speech"". Not to say that I did not admire Colin Firth's virtuoso performance as King George VI or Geoffrey's Rush divine work as Louge. Firth and Rush are most deserving of all the accolades they have been receiving. The undervalued Guy Pearce also did a kingsman job himself with his supporting performance as the King's big bro David. However, I do have to say that Helena Bonham Carter's performance as Queen Mum Elizabeth is solid but not a monarchic one as many critics have hailed it to be. Screenwriter David Seidler, a former stutterer himself, contributes a resounding & inspirational scribe that is not in a loss for words. I am not the Firth to say that the ""The King's Speech"" speaks volumes on the human spirit. ***** Excellent",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Flawless,"You'd be hard pressed to find anything really negative to say about The King's Speech. Even if you try hard to question the historical accuracy, as some critics have, you still have a fantastic story of perseverance, of loyalty, and of friendship. Firth and Rush give phenomenal performances - for both, I suspect, the best performance of their career (Rush at least has some competition with Shine). Helena Bonham Carter gives an uncharacteristically low-key and humble performance, and the entire supporting cast - Guy Pearce, Timothy Spall, Derek Jacobi and Michael Gambon especially - are cast to perfection and do a terrific job. From a purely dramatic and cinematic perspective, The King's Speech is a near-perfect movie and deserves of an Oscar more than most winners of recent years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
An absolute joy!,"A large number of period dramas, especially those centring on royalty, have achieved great artistic and financial success in the history of movies. Their attributed points of content typically include the stylish visual essence of the relevant era, the seething corruption and injustice present, and the influence of a wise and regal protagonist. This year's The King's Speech is certainly one of the finest of the genre, right up there with the magnificent Elizabeth, and its inclusion of the three aforementioned classic elements is incontestable, yet they fall second place to a wonderfully poignant tale of inhibition and liberation.England's pitifully inarticulate and introverted Prince Albert (Colin Firth) is edging ever close to the dreaded, burdensome throne in the uneasy years between the two World Wars. An imposing government, an expectant public, and an unsettlingly coarse father (Michael Gambon, playing King George V for the second time) surround, hitting him with an avalanche of worries and doubts that continue to aggravate his heavily troublesome stammer, which makes all radio speeches an embarrassing nightmare. After years of problems, his always caring and sympathetic wife (Helena Bonham Carter, perfectly charming here as usual) assigns the highly-regarded experimental speech therapist Lionel Logue (a deliciously quirky and also affecting Geoffrey Rush) to this difficult case. For the hapless ""Bertie"", sessions are met with considerable reluctance, Lionel's personal questions are received with anger, and heated discussions often lead to the patient's frustrated withdrawal, though he always returns eventually and never ventures too far from a burning desire to be heard without condescension.Here we do see Nazism, royal troubles, and elegant costumes and set design, but they are merely superficial plot lines that serve the heartrending journey of Bertie, later known as King George VI, which lies at its beautiful core. True as it may be that there are perhaps some sappy and unimpressively conventional episodes placed throughout the story, we accept all such events because the stark unfaltering realism of its characters is always there to reinforce the piece. Firth magnificently and touchingly captures the internal rage and maddening fragility of those who are outwardly inept and therefore rarely taken seriously. Rush makes an absolute masterpiece of his role, pumping every line and indeed every second of screen time with glorious intricate characterization. In the acting department, we even have the pleasure of seeing Guy Pearce, Derek Jacobi and Timothy Spall among others in the supporting cast.All in all, one cannot view this film without praising it enthusiastically: it is truly marvellous.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Well done.,"I thought that this movie was brilliant. I give it a 10 out of a 10. Why? The story was touching. We get to see the personal side of the royal family before and during WW2: the toing and froing between the two brothers, Edward and George; and of course the main story: King George's very personal battle with his stammer and public speaking. George was constantly stood on and belittled by his brother and his father and thought that he would not fit the 'true' picture of a perfect King. With the help of a speech therapist he finally comes to grips with his speech impediments, and thus gains more control of his fear of public speaking.The cast was brilliant. Colin Firth, particularly, stole the film. Aided with the speech therapist played by Geoffrey Rush, he steals every scene he is in. Having said that though Rush was brilliant in his role. The cheeky down-to-earth Aussie provided a bit of light relief with the seriousness being shown. Other good performances were Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill and the great Michael Gambon as King George V.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Interesting story with wit and humour...and heart.  9.5/10,"The title of this movie is itself ambiguous...referring at once to the way the future king stammered when he spoke as well to the first speech he would have to give to his people, on the occasion of Britain declaring war against Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany. So, it is a historical drama with, no doubt, some artistic licence. From the description above, one can see that it was an especially bad time for someone with a stammer to have to face up to the public duty of addressing his subjects via radio broadcasts. Long before that defining moment for King George VI (played by Colin Firth), his wife, the Duchess of York (later to be Queen Elizabeth, played by Helena Bonham Carter), seeks someone to help overcome her husband's stammer. She finds Lionel Logue (played by Geoffrey Rush), an Australian with seemingly good credentials for the task.Despite this unlikely subject for a movie, it does have wit and humour and warmth...from many of the principal characters. It also has some strong swearing at times, though this amusingly handled. The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent. Some of the actors provide glimpses of regality...I can believe that Helena Bonham Carter in some glimpses does indeed look like what I imagine the Duchess of York looked like in those years. She also conveys great charm and warmth...a pleasant change from the decomposing sorts she has been drawn to play in recent years. Guy Pearce as the soon to be King Edward VIII does look aristocratic in some aspects in scenes...or at least in a Hollywood kind of way.The royal couple's young daughters are pretty and nice. The actress playing the future Princess Margaret reminded me of the girl who played the daughter in the UK sitcom ""Outnumbered"". It turns out that it is the same actress. One would have been most amused if Princess Margaret in this movie had asked numerous probing questions of her father...say, during his bedtime story. Sadly, this was not to be...one would like the answers to questions such as ""What would Jesus do if he was attacked by a polar bear?""!One does get personal insight into this family...Prince Albert of York (that's the later King George VI...played by Colin Firth...still...oh do keep up!) is a very damaged human being as represented here. Some of his adventures with his brother are jaw dropping...and Geoffrey Rush's subtlety is marvellous when being told of them by Bertie (still played by Colin Firth). On the other hand, Elizabeth does tell a lovely story as to why she married Bertie...it would be nice if it were true.In a similar vein, one may be surprised to hear the slander spoken by the Duchess of York, concering the nature of Mrs. Wallis Simpson's hold over Edward, the next in line to the throne. That was not news to me, but I had forgotten it, perhaps. This may be one of those 'artistic licence' issues. Was the slander true? Or just a narky, plebian insult to hurled on to someone who dared to ignore aristocratic conventions? Interesting that the Duchess is made to voice that slander in any case.A fascinating glimpse into a bygone era. Bertie does seem to hold a modern view of the family in this movie though (he calls it ""The firm""). Ironically, he also holds atavistic views of the family, as witnessed in his reaction to Logue's suggestion that he (Bertie) could be king...a view mirrored by Edward's analysis of what Bertie is up to with his speech therapy.Lastly, this movie may even be educational for those with speech disorders...and inspiring too. There are some 'interesting' approaches to the disorder.Can't say that I've seen all the movies which have been talked about in relationship to Academy Awards, but I like Helena Bonham Carter's subtle turn as Elizabeth. It would not kill me to see Colin Firth win a Best Actor award either, but one wonders if stammering is sufficiently ""disabled"" to appeal to the Academy! Geoffrey Rush would be an acceptable Best Supporting Actor too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

A brilliant royal drama!,"The King's Speech is an impressive movie from start to finish, where we see newly crowned King George VI (Colin Firth) attempting to cure his stammer problem by seeking the help of speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). The obstacles that plaque the king's duties and his loyal subjects' confidence in his leadership are suspenseful to watch and the chemistry of the patient-doctor friendship between the king and Lionel is touching. Even more suspenseful is watching the king's ability to lead being tested as England foresees war in the future.The acting was terrific as it accentuated the unfolding drama and represented the dignified personalities of the British subjects, particular that of the Royal Family. Colin Firth did a great job in portraying King George VI, as did Helena Bonham Carter portraying his wife, Queen Elizabeth. I especially liked the scene where Lionel's wife was taken aback when she discovered that the queen was sitting in her dining room, waiting for the king to finish his speech session with Lionel. In addition, Geoffrey Rush was brilliant as Lionel Logue, displaying a little bit of defiance and character to successfully treat George VI by making him act as his equal.I would have liked to see a little more royal pomp and fanfare, for example, like the majesties donning crowns and scepters and parading through town. But, it's a brilliant film overall that relies solely on the drama and the little bits of humor for pure entertainment.

regardless of our feelings about the monarchy .....,".... can we not just enjoy this film as a great character driven drama with great acting and sharp, witty dialog !!!!As a Canadian I'm all for keeping the monarchy where it belongs, in the UK, and let them deal with it however they please. But because we are part of the commonwealth, the queen is considered our head of state and billions of taxpayers dollars are wasted to support the governor general as her representative in our country and a lieutenant governor for each province + all the royal visits we have to contend with. So do away with them I say (in a non-violent way of course). Unfortunately, like in Australia not too long ago, if a referendum were to be held, most would vote to hang on to them.Having said that, for me this is the best movie I've seen this year. Immensely enjoyable and engaging on all emotional levels as a story of human beings, royal or not, dealing with hardships of sorts and overcoming them. Acted to perfection by each cast member, with dialog that was smart, literate, funny and moving.Start preparing your speech for that Oscar, Colin (and any other actor in this film to be nominated) !!!!In conclusion: down with the monarchy, up with The King's Speech !!!!P.S.

Why are you stuttering?!,"In the King's Speech, we see a perfectly able, decent man incapacitated by a disorder. What holds him back is stuttering, something that is caused by his unhappy past. Alas, he is no ordinary man and may just be forced to step up to a place of a king at a time of worldly crisis. Oh, the fear that must grip him! Not only of the nightmarish public embarrassment but even worse, the fear of failing to lead a nation (and perhaps a good part of the world) because of a seemingly small impediment that he fails to overcome.And that's the point of the speech disorder, I think. From my perspective, the entire person of King George VI seems so stupid because of his stuttering. I say to him, ""Hey, what's the matter? Why are you stuttering? There's no reason for you to stutter! Just speak normally, like me. Now watch how I do it."" As I watched him battling his demon with the help of a mentor, I came to appreciate a little more the problems that people have, whatever they may be.

If anybody wanted to know what makes Queen Elizabeth II, this film should help fill in the missing pieces of the scandal of her Uncle King Edward VII and his scandalous relationship with American divorcée Wallis Simpson. He left the throne for her. While for those of us who aren't aristocracy, we can't imagine what they're lives are like. Shakespeare has written about kings and men who seek it. Not George VI better known as Bertie. I think he would have rather preferred to be a commoner like the rest of us. Instead, he sacrificed his personal life to lead a nation in it's most difficult time. It's not an easy job even now. Bertie would be very proud of his daughter, Elizabeth II, and her reign as Queen.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
On the edge of your seat drama,"This film is one of the best movies I have ever seen in a long while. There are few movies out there that have had me on the edge of my seat at the start. You are so moved as soon as Colin Firth (Prince George) says his first word. The hairs just went up at the back of my neck watching him.The performances of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are just mesmerising and you just feel the electricity of the two actors together. They just click and you are so much taken along for the ride. You can't help but feel for Colin Firth's character in this as Prince George with this huge fear, the temper and the embarrassment of his problem.There is quite a bit of comedy in the film so it's got everything really. Some of it really makes you smile.A special mention needs to be made about Helena Bonham Carter as the queen mother Elizabeth. So much likeness and sweetness to the character but a steely nonsense too. She's amazingly - spot on.The ending is just breathtaking and so touching. It's fabulous.The supporting cast and the direction by Tom Hooper just make this a one in a million film.10/10 love it",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Royal Snoozefest.,"Although I was not here for parts of the move, from what I saw the movie was alright. The plot could have been a little more interesting. I say this because there weren't many dramatic effects. It was more bland and rolled from scene to scene without any suspense to make you want to keep watching. Colin Firth did a good job at pretending to have a speech impediment, however hearing all the mouth noises he made throughout the film made me want to jump through the screen and punch him. The only thing that made me happy was seeing Helena Bonham Carter in the film, but that joy comes purely because she did such a good job in the Harry Potter films that she could play in any movie no matter how good or bad it was and I would still like watching it.The director used questionable camera angles at times and I feel that if they used suspenseful background music it would have made the movie much more enjoyable to watch. The 0.5 camera angle made the cast look like lost goldfish or toddlers angry waddling when their mom says no to a cookie. If I was an actor in that movie and I saw my forehead plastered on a screen I'd be fuming. The scenery was bland as well as the colour pallet throughout the movie. Total snoozefest..... I'm struggling to find some nice things to say about this movie. I mean I guess the actors did a good job playing their roles, but I mean how hard is it to play a stale piece of bread that occasionally says something half intelligent.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Brilliant movie!,"Excellent acting, brilliant move, and probably the best I have seen in a long time. No need to go into the story, because after reading through a few of these, you will already understand why this is a ""must see"" film. Brilliant, can I say that again?I believe that teens and anyone with a speech impediment or other impediment could come away with a sense of what they can accomplish from hard work and dedication. I don't usually buy films once they're on DVD, but this one is a keeper.It is not every day you get to see a film that does not have cars crashing, guns everywhere, and buildings being blown up.

My favorite film of 2010 by a long shot!,"Tom Hooper last blew viewers away with his critically praised HBO miniseries ""John Adams"", which starred Paul Giamati in the title role. Now, he returns to his native England to tell a bit of a different story.Prince Albert, The Duke of York (Colin Firth) is in a bit of a rough spot. His father, King Goerge V is dying. With his father's deminishing health, all of the King's messages are delivered to the people of England via radio, and it's up to people like Albert to delever those messages to his people. The only problem is that Albert, or Bertie to his family, has suffered from a severe stutter since the age of 5. Despite the fact that he's seen every single speech therapist and specialist on the entire continent, his wife (Helana Bonnam Carter) stills feels that there's hope for her husband. So, against his wishes, she hires an eccentric Australian Speech Therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). If Logue fails, then nothing can help Bertie.Logue and Bertie don't exactly hit it off, and their freindship, as well as Bertie's life is filled with speed bumps including the death of his father, the fact that his brother, David, will be the new king, and the fact that David (Guy Pearce) is marrying a woman named Wallis Simpson, an American who has been married twice. After David finds himself unfit to rule, he avdocates the throne to his younger brother. Unfortionatly, soon after Bertie takes the throne, Adolf Hitler announces his plans to attack England. This shoves the country into WWII, and forces Bertie to conquer his fears.Firth and Rush are at their best here, playing two very unique people who form an even odder bond. What makes this film all the more remarkable is the fact that both Albert, who later became King George VI, and Lionel Logue both existed in real life, as do many of the otehr characters, including Bertie's young daughter, Elizabeth. Fantastic cameos by actors like Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop, Cosmo Lange, and Timothy Spall as Winston Chirchill. But NOTHING can take away from the spellbinding performances by Colin Firth and Geffrey Rush",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
w w www ww wonderful....,"I am not King George VI, so I do not know how to deliver a great speech or say something beautiful. But if I have to describe this movie in one word it would have to be either Wonderful or Beautiful and you would agree with me after watching this movie. What makes this movie wonderful is masterclass direction and crisp editing. But this is only the half story the other half or I should say the better half is Colin Firth. Most of the actors would have done ""over acting"" for the same role but Mr. Colin did it to the perfection and not for a single moment i felt that he was acting. He was genius in the role. The pain and helplessness in his eyes while delivering the words was there to see. What else i should say, i can go on and on. These two factors I highlighted were the main reasons of a beautiful movie but thats not all. All the cast of the movie did full justice to their roles and everyone behind the camera must get the credit too as they made it look so real. This is the type of movie why one must fall in love with cinema. Watch it to believe it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Worthy Of All The Awards,"I enjoyed this the first time but on the second, I really appreciated this film and am very glad it won the awards it did. What superb acting, direction and cinematography. What an interesting - and different - story.I know Colin Firth won the ""Best Actor"" Oscar but I just loved Geoffrey Rush in here as the speech therapist, ""Lionel Logue."" He was riveting, throughout the movie (not that Firth wasn't great as King George VI). Helen Bonham-Carter was very good, too, in an understated role as the king's wife, the famous Queen Elizabeth.Kudos to Director Tom Hooper and Director Of Photography Danny Cohen. They made the picture just stunning to view.Don't let the storyline fool you. Yes, it's about a king who had a stuttering problem and the man who helped him. Sounds boring, but it isn't.

The King's Speech is one of the best historical dramas I've recently seen,"This movie-The King's Speech-is an inspirational, funny, and ultimately touching true story of eventual King George VI's overcoming his stammering speaking patterns when reading his first public speech as the new royal head of Buckingham Palace. As played by Colin Firth, Bertie-his actual given name-reluctantly lets himself be taught elocution lessons by one Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who has him do various crazy things to achieve results like singing some words to American tunes like ""Camptown Races"" or ""Swanee River"" and letting some profanities out freely in session! Also giving a fine performance is Helena Bonham Carter as Bertie's wife Elizabeth especially when she reveals why she eventually agreed to marry him. If Firth wins Best Actor at the Oscars, it will be much deserved. So on that note, The King's Speech is highly recommended. P.S. When I first saw Timothy Spall on screen, I thought he was doing Alfred Hitchcock until I realized that Winston Churchill had the same face shape!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"Well-Acted, Well-Paced Historical Drama","This is the true story of King George VI (Colin Firth) and his rise to power while also fighting off a problem with stammering. Not to mention the rise of Nazi Germany, and any number of other problems.I first watched this film in early February, 2011. One month prior, ""King's Speech"" had ranked fairly low on my to-see list. Then the buzz started coming, the Academy Awards nominated the film for an astounding twelve awards, and reports started to come in that the film was matching the hype. So now I have seen it, and I must say it was pretty good. Flash forward to April 2011 and I have seen it again -- the film holds up well, and while we may debate about whether it deserved all its awards, it certainly earned what it got.I know little of Colin Firth's work, and have never appreciated Helena Bonham Carter, but this film shows them both to be on top of their game. Shots were scheduled around Carter, who was working on Harry Potter at the time, but she used her free time to study up on her character with historians. I would say she put her all into this picture.Firth seemed to be a shoo-in for the best actor Oscar, and sure enough he nailed it. Geoffrey Rush is always great, and this is no exception... I was hoping for a supporting actor win the way he uses his mime training to move his body fluidly.The film was fairly lengthy for such a simple topic, but it was paced very well and because of that could probably have been even longer and I would have been just fine with it. Some people are complaining about the film's historical accuracy, and I hear that, but the film in general is pretty great and the Nazi aspect can be overlooked. It was interesting to see Queen Elizabeth II so young...You might not recognize her, but Claire Bloom (Chaplin's ""Limelight"") is here, and if you are interested in commentaries, check this one out. The commentary includes director Tom Hooper singing ""Montage"" from ""Team America: World Police"", and he repeatedly calls the film a bromance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Great Film But is it a True Oscar Winner?,"No doubt about it, The King's Speech is a great film that features a talented British cast and often does a good job at keeping the attention of the audience. I never thought that I would like this film as much as I did, but I was pleasantly surprised. I think Tom Hooper made a name for himself with this movie.This film is a historical film based off King George the Sixth and his famous speech problems. This film has George meeting his speech therapist and reluctantly agrees to do the therapist's programs. After his brother abdicates the throne, George may need his therapist more than ever.Colin Firth delivers a excellent performance. This portrayal may be his best ever in his career. He truly excelled as King George. It's as if he transformed into George. The supporting cast led by Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter were splendid. This film is one that can be used to teach people on what acting looks like when done properly.Overall, this is a great film with lots of promise. It has a few dull moments here or there. The main question is: does this film deserves Best Picture? Honestly, I don't think so. I thought The Social Network or The Fighter should have won. But, nonetheless I was really happy about how great this film turned out to be. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A lesson on how to make a historical film,"This film shows the struggle of King George VI of England against his stammer, shyness and insecurity, as well as his relationship with his controversial speech therapist. Directed by Tom Hooper, the film has screenplay by David Seidler and the participation of Colin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter, Geoffrey Rush, Michael Gambon, Guy Pearce and Timothy Spall.This film has a star cast, where Colin Firth had space to show all his talent, achieving a fabulous performance. No less brilliant was Geoffrey Rush, with a flawless interpretation, further enlivened by a wonderful diction and voice placement. It's clearly that he is an actor with a great theatrical school and, although it sometimes be harmful in cinema, it was very well used by the actor to build his character. The script was done with great care and, although some things have been changed for dramatic purposes (it's a film, not a documentary), we can say that it seeks to portray the historical truth rigorously, which is always worthy of merit. In this regard, we must also highlight the costumes, filming locations and scenarios, carefully designed to recreate that time. The soundtrack, including several classical pieces, is sublime.This film, winner of the Oscar for Best Film, Best Leading Actor, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, has also won the Golden Globe for Best Actor and the congratulations of the British Royal Family, with the Queen herself thrilled seeing this film, and the way it portrays her late father. Not being a documentary, it faithfully portrays that time and the people involved, being a lesson for any director who wishes to make an historical film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Is there already a contender for the best film of 2011?,"Marla, Darcy, Captain Barbossa, even Dumbledore. Not the type of portrayal and mixture of past roles that could make you believe The King's Speech is anything shy of fantastic casting. Braving these performances, helm the Oscar potentials Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter; particularly the foremost whose equilibrium of the frustration and determination never wavers.As well as presenting the daunting public speaking story arch of Albert's stutter, there's the more demoralizing dilemma of not being able to tell his children a story without the uphill effort to maintain his casualness.These aren't remedied by a drab series of music maimed sessions to ease this problem that lead to an unsatisfying voila; throughout all the exertion it takes him there's a very discrete pendent that dangles a thoughtful what-we-take-for-granted moral without taking it to full blown bluntness.Firth defines George VI as less of a standard cardboard cut-out King (take note dimensionless Eric Bana in the granny friendly mediocrity of The Other Boleyn Girl) just through his impediment frequently getting the better of him. In one scene, to great humour, his anger is exerted to a more profanity filled outcome which won't be spoiled as to be savoured but won't be hard to spot. Just one of Lionel's perverse methods, that effectively contrasts to the heroic struggle of man vs. stutter.Modelled to integrity, grandeur and supreme casting, The King's Speech boasts quite possibly the year best (and earliest) film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Brilliant on Every Level!,"THE KING'S SPEECH is one of those rare films that rely on the brilliance of the actors to bring a story/screenplay alive. But the success of this extraordinary film does not stop there. This re-telling of history as written by David Seidler and as directed with enormous sensitivity by Tom Hooper, as captured on film by cinematographer Danny Cohen glows as a background for some of the finest acting before the public today.The film opens in 1925 as King George V (Michael Gambon) is beginning to fail, leaving the heir apparent to the throne at the time of his death to be Edward VIII (Guy Pearce), a man more concerned with love with the twice divorced Wallis Simpson (Eve Best) than he is with the Royal Lineage. Once the now senile George V dies, Edward VIII takes the throne but soon abdicates to marry Wallis. This passes the throne to the tender but severely stammering Prince Albert (Colin Firth), a man terrified of facing his beloved countrymen because of his speech defect - a defect that his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) has encouraged him to correct through a series of speech doctors. Elizabeth hears of Australian émigré Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a poor wannabe actor who gained his knowledge for correcting speech defects teaching returning WW I victims in Australia. Prince Albert (Bertie) and Logue meet and begin therapy by Logue's tough rules before Albert takes the throne. Through a series of rigorous exercises and lessons Logue helps the Prince learn to speak, finally accompanying him to the throne as a speech therapist and giving Bertie (now known as King George VI) the courage and strength to rise to the occasion of leading England through WW II.Though the above is a brief synopsis of the story, the real message of the film deals with the gradual building of a close friendship between Bertie and Logue - or between royalty and commoner. The manner in which Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush create this memorable relationship represents some of the finest acting in cinema history. The very large cast includes such luminaries as Claire Bloom as Queen Mary, Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, Jennifer Ehle as Logue's wife, Timothy Spall in a brilliant turn as Winston Churchill, Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Roger Parrott as Neville Chamberlain. Alexandre Desplat provides the original music allow heavy portions of Beethoven's 7th Symphony and Emperor Concerto (with Steven Osborne as piano soloist). This is a perfect film, well deserving to win the Oscars for every category for which it is nominated.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
a treasure-trove of great performances,"Earning Oscars for itself as well as for its star, Colin Firth, ""The King's Speech"" is an entertaining historical drama whose intelligent writing and superb acting allow it to triumph over its conventional theme.In this real-life version of ""Pygmalion,"" Firth plays Prince Albert (aka the Duke of York, aka King George VI), the British royal whose severe speech impediment haunted him throughout his early life and made being a monarch difficult in a time when a new little device called radio made speaking in public a necessity for anyone serious about being a respected leader on the world stage. Geoffrey Rush costars as Lionel Logue, the unlicensed speech therapist and part time stage actor who helped him overcome his affliction.Written by David Seidler (who himself suffered from a stammer as a child) and directed by Tom Hooper, ""The King's Speech"" is very much in the mold of all those fusty, do-gooding, inspirational biographies that always seem to grab the lion's-share of trophies when awards season comes around. However, this particular one avoids some of the pitfalls of the genre by being less about the physical affliction and more about the psychological issues underlying that affliction. Indeed, in their numerous sessions together, Lionel turns out to be more psychotherapist than speech coach for a man who - due to his position as a member of a tightly circumscribed and stiff-upper-lipped monarchy - has no one but this comparative stranger to confide his innermost thoughts and feelings to. Clearly wise in the ways of human nature, Lionel rightly determines that Albert's affliction has less to do with any kind of physical ailment than with his bottled-up feelings towards his father, the unforgiving taskmaster King George V, and his older brother, Edward, Prince of Wales, whose own dalliance with a divorced American commoner leads him to abdicate the throne after only a short period, thereby clearing the way for Albert to assume his rightful place as England's king. Lionel determines that, more than anything else, it's fear – of humiliating himself in public, of failing to live up to the standards set by a demanding and uncompromising father, of not being able to fulfill the duties his royal birth has thrust upon him – that is the real underlying cause of Albert's problem. And Lionel, commoner though he may be, isn't shy about confronting the king with some frank truths about himself when he deems it necessary. He even insists on addressing his royal pupil as ""Bertie,"" the nickname only his immediate family could previously use. And, of course, the stuttering itself becomes a part of a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle, as it continually eats away at not only Albert's image of himself as a man but his confidence as the individual who's just been handed the heavy burden of leading a beleaguered and frightened nation through the perilous days of World War II.Firth and Rush are both magnificent in their roles, establishing an amazing chemistry between them, as the royal and the commoner brush aside the arbitrary distinctions of division and class to meet on the ground of their common humanity. Firth never overplays the stuttering, and the expressions of pain and frustration that periodically flit across his face when he's trying so desperately to be understood make us empathize with his predicament entirely. Likewise, Rush has never seemed more relaxed and confident than he does here, providing a perfect foil for the king's faltering self-confidence. In lesser hands, the role of Lionel could easily have degenerated into low comedy buffoonery, but Rush never gives in to the temptation, giving us instead a richly shaded and thoughtfully understated portrayal of the character.There is fine work too by Helena Bonham Carter as Albert's devoted and supportive wife, Elizabeth, Duchess of York; an English-accented Guy Pearce as Edward, Prince of Wales; Derek Jacobi as the Archbishop of Canterbury; Anthony Andrews as Stanley Baldwin, and Claire Bloom as Albert's mother, Queen Mary.But the film is Firth's and Rush's all the way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Emotional and touching. It will uplift your spirit a very well done courageous work of art.,"I must say that clearly ""The King's Speech"" is one of the better films I've saw in a long time. It's historical and it can be classified as an emotional drama a brave work of art of how one man King George VI(Bertie) overcame a speech impairment stammer just to speak! As you watch you will feel touched with emotions as the film blends moments of humor, anger, and courage so well together.Set in 1920's Great Britain it follows the life of Bertie(an extraordinary performance from one of the best actors around Colin Firth)and he's a well and mild mannered Englishman who's happily married to royalty in Queen Elizabeth(Helena Bonham Carter)and Bertie enjoys the company of his two daughters also. Yet for such a good guy he's got a nasty problem and that is he speaks with a bad speech stammer. As Bertie nearly puts audiences to sleep as his words struggle to get out.Only hope is found in the form of Lionel Logue(a top notch supporting performance from Geoffrey Rush)a down on his luck and failed England stage actor. Never fear Lionel has the talent of teaching speech even though his methods are unorthodox as they include singing, humming, and reading slow some of these scenes are compelling and funny yet moving as this training brings out the anger in Bertie only for his good as he can now use it to face his fear.Aside from the conquering of a speech problem a bigger problem is on the way as with the passing of Bertie's father King George V and with the failed and scandal plagued reign of his brother David it forces Bertie to be next in line for the throne. And having a speech therapist by his side is a must as the newly King George VI must give a commanding speech of courage and confidence to the nation as war looms with Hitler and the Germans.Overall great film with ""The King's Speech"" you will laugh, feel pain and be emotionally touched. It's one courageous film and a great work of art with A+ performances from Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. You will feel your spirit lifted and aside from the drama and historical importance of the film it teaches a message of courage and it proves a person no matter what throne they sit on must overcome a personal defect impediment while having the faith and courage to lead a nation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

A joy.,"The King's Speech is the first film I have seen in 2011 and it will almost certainly be the film I enjoy most this year.The film tells the story of the Duke of York (Colin Firth) who is second in line to the throne and suffering from a terrible stutter. The family name for the Duke is Bertie. He has tried many different Doctors in an effort to cure the stutter, but none have been able to help. Ultimately the Duke of York becomes King George VI after the abdication of Edward VIII. In the new era of Radio it is vital that the King can communicate with the people so the stutter is like torture to the King whenever he is required to speak publicly. His wife Elizabeth (Helen Bonham Carter) introduces Bertie to a failed Australian actor Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who has turned to speech therapy.Logue has an unusual approach to speech therapy and it seems the relationship is doomed to failure. Bertie gives up on a number of occasions, but seems convinced that Logue may actually be helping him.The film is delightful throughout although there is quite a lot of swearing which may rankle for those people who do not like bad language. It is always very lighthearted and you completely warm to all the main characters. The scenes between Firth and Rush are mesmerising and it seems very likely that they may be in line for Oscar recognition. The film is beautifully filmed and excellently directed by Tom Hooper who also directed The Damned United which was also excellent.Not one for the adrenalin junkies, but a joy for everyone else!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Awful and unoriginal,"The movie had no colour, other than brown, black and white. It was depressing to watch. If this is honestly how England looked back in the 30s, then just DON'T MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT IT. Why on Earth would we want to be reminded about how colourless and boring the world was? I did like ""The Godfather"" though, it felt much less claustrophobic, and it was based near the same time period. This movie made me feel so enclosed, and trapped, and I couldn't even finish watching it. I ran out of the theatre 15 minutes early, but my parents explained what happened. Nothing interesting happened in the movie. Somebody has a speech impediment, SO WHAT? TONS OF PEOPLE HAVE SPEECH IMPEDIMENTS! TONS OF PEOPLE WERE ABUSED IN THEIR CHILDHOOD! THAT'S NOTHING NEW AT ALL! This movie looks like it was made in the 70s, but even if I watched it in the 70s, I still wouldn't like it. As I mentioned before, it made me feel claustrophobic.

Speech: A Joyful Melody of Anger and Rejoice,"""The King's Speech"" is a film that is about more than just a speech in a moment in time, it is about the journey of Prince Albert (Colin Firth) from being the Duke of York with a speech impediment to becoming King George VI and the voice of England in World War II. Tom Hooper directs this true tale concerning a special relationship that forms between King George VI also known as Bertie and his speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) that has received seven Golden Globe nominations and eleven Critic's Choice nominations. The film begins shortly before the death of King George V (Michael Gambon) and after a failed speech by Bertie due to his stammering speech impediment. His wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carer) has been researching the best speech therapists in order to help her husband, however, time and time again they failed to procure any results. She finally stumbles across a man named Lionel Logue known for his unique therapeutic practices., but at first Bertie is very skeptical and believes that this is going to be just another failure. However, after a minor bet over a shilling and some surprising results, he finds himself back in Lionel's office. Together Bertie and Lionel build a strong bond while preparing for his ultimate task. Bertie is in line to take his dead father's place as king after his brother King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce) steps down from his royal role in order to marry American Wallis Simpson. England is in need of a leader and with t the help of his best friend Lionel Logue, King George VI rises to the occasion fulfilling the extraordinary role of unifying a country on the brink of war with Hitler's Germany.The acting of both Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush is spectacular and the chemistry between the two is even better. They are able to transform a very straightforward and predictable story into an original look at an underdog story. Colin Firth's performance is so very real and believable that he makes you feel like you are in one of those dreams where you are trying speak and call out for help, but are not able to. Geoffrey Rush adds a lot of comedy to the movie and makes the viewing process very enjoyable. The journey that these two men take together in the film is mastered perfectly as the two curse at each other and make speech more than just well articulated words stung together. Combined with beautiful cinematography speech becomes a joyful melody of anger and rejoice as it flows from the mouth of King George VII.Despite the cinematography the film has a very boring exposition making it hard for the audience to connect to the story. The film lacks the flare that takes off about fifty minutes or an hour into the film. One thing that was very disappointing about the film was Helena Bonham Carter's performance. Does she deserve the Best Supporting Actress nominations that she has received? Probably. However, her performance does not match up to her fellow stars. She does not have any wow moments and she does not mesmerize you. Instead she acts at as a consistent above average actress throughout the film.""The King's Speech"" is a film very similar to the story that it tells. Once you count the film out it begins to grow on you and is pretty damn good in the end, which is worth seeing now. Also, Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are both very strong contenders in this year's award season and may surprise us in the end as they go head to head with James Franco and Christian Bale for the Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor Oscars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Interesting,"The King's Speech"" is a remarkable movie about a remarkable friendship. It honors the audience's intelligence, which makes it a double rarity.The friendship that painstakingly evolves is between Prince Albert, Duke of York (Colin Firth) and Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a frustrated Austalian actor turned highly unorthodox speech therapist. Albert, who has a dreadful stammer, has failed all previous medical interventions and vows never to try another.Only the ministrations of his wife, Elizabeth, (a marvelous Helena Bonham Carter) bring him to Lionel, who, believing emotional intimacy is curative, insists on addressing the rankled Prince as ""Bertie,"" the family nickname. ""My game, my turf, my rules,"" he states flatly. Recommended: Could you pass a US citizenship test? Among many other good things, ""The King's Speech,"" directed by Tom Hooper (HBO's ""John Adams"") and written by David Seidler, is a meditation on a transitional time when royalty was expected to speak to the nation and not just pose commandingly before it.Albert, son of King George V (Michael Gambon), believed he was protected from the humiliations of public oration because his brother Edward (Guy Pearce) was in succession. But when Edward, as king, abdicates to marry American socialite Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), Albert is reluctantly enthroned.Prior to this, Albert and Lionel had achieved an uneasy alliance which breaks apart after Lionel suggests ""Bertie"" is his brother's better. What was intended as inspirational is received by Albert as the impertinence of a ""nobody."" (It's a heartbreaking scene.) Their ultimate reconciliation, which is as sensitively rendered as the fine-drawn gradations of friendship preceding it, is the heart of the movie.It is Lionel's belief that Albert, whom he regards as ""the bravest man I know,"" could be a wonderful king. On the evidence available to him, this might seem like a stretch – Albert's bravery, after all, is essentially confined to eradicating his stammer, and we never hear him discuss statesmanship, about which he seems adamantly uninterested.But the conceit works because the filmmakers, like Lionel, regard Albert in his totality. He's not King George VI, he's a man. This is one of the very few films that plumb the psychological resonances of royalty instead of merely illustrating them. Firth is tremendously touching in the role without even once condescending to the audience. It would have been easy to sentimentalize Albert into a common-man-under-the-skin. But Firth gives us instead a portrait of a nowhere man suddenly thrust onto the world stage. His aloneness is palpable.When asked by Lionel if he was ever close to anyone growing up, Albert speaks of his nannies. With his own daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, Albert, in his own guarded way, is the parent he probably wished he had. There's a wonderful scene where he tells them a story about a penguin, and he seems to be regressing at that moment into an idyllic fantasy of what his own childhood might have been like. (He also doesn't stammer as much with them.) Albert also has a gravely humorous side. When Lionel, in an early scene, asks him if he knows any jokes, he answers that ""timing isn't my strong suit."" He watches Hitler fulminate in a newsreel and can't help but comment that the man certainly can speak. Albert sees through the pretensions of kingship even as he is impelled to enact them. ""We're not a family, we're a firm,"" he says of his family. ""We've become actors."" Lionel is also a species of actor, and even though the film rather too neatly points up the correspondence between these two men, it makes emotional sense. Lionel, in the end, sees Albert as a performer who is capable not only of becoming the role he has inherited, but glorifying it.This is how Lionel sees himself, too. When he auditions, early on, for the title role in a low-rent production of ""Richard III,"" he may be dreadful but the theatrical commitment is intense. Geoffrey Rush is such an imaginative actor that he can encompass this man's entire conflicted make-up – the ambition, humility, obstinacy, sadness – in a single brief scene. Because he is capable of fully entering into another man's psyche, Lionel comprehends Albert the way an artist might. As Albert's speech therapist, Lionel is the great artist he never was as an actor.The film concludes with the 1939 radio broadcast in which the stalwart, terrified King George VI, with Lionel alone by his side in a closed-off room, addresses Britain as it enters into war with Germany. This speech – a cliffhanger and a culmination – is what the entire movie has been incrementally leading up to. ""Say it to me as a friend,"" Lionel counsels Albert, and the words fall into place with the finality of a great truth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A fine lead performance makes this an unusual film choice for me,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1930s England, King George the Fifth (Colin Firth) has succeeded to the throne upon the abdication of his brother, and the fate of the country now rests on his shoulders. However, a speech impediment renders him unable to perform his public duties to the fullest, and is the cause of much embarrassment. Defiantly proud, but mindful he needs to do something to improve his problem, 'Bertie' enlists the help of unconventional speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush.) The pair enjoy a difficult and frosty relationship to start with, but over time come to form an effective and unbreakable partnership that takes both men to places they never thought they would go, as war with Germany looms on the horizon and the public need a leader more than ever as the thirties close.The monarchy, whatever your politics on it, undoubtedly provide this little island of ours with it's broad sense of history and tradition, and will stand us in the annals of time for quite a while. From this vast catalogue of stories to pick from, this little number pulls out the last individual to sit on the throne before the current one, and highlights the little touched on fact of his struggles to communicate, in private and in public. Such an idea might seem like a curious one for a film idea, but it's brought to life quite well by Tom Hooper, which is as fine an indicator of talent as you could hope.To be honest, this generally isn't the kind of film I would choose to watch of my own accord, but lead star Firth's performance had received so much acclaim and looked like it had the potential to be so great, that I decided to give it a go. And Firth does not disappoint, delivering what must surely be one of the defining performances of his career, bringing the king to life with all his ticks and mannerisms just perfectly, and just generally managing a guy with an horrific speech problem and his attempts to rid himself of it quite commendably. He's complimented by a fine supporting cast, most notably Rush as his eccentric but caring aide, but not forgetting the likes of Deek Jacobi and Helena Bonham Carter.Even if this is the kind of thing you'd usually avoid like the plague, the great performance of the lead actor is reason enough to go out of your way with this one, and all the awards and rave reviews it's received should bear testament to this. ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Never give up.. A film that touches the heart,"""The King's Speech"" is a British historical film which was first released on 6 September 2010.This film tells the story of a King George VI (Prince Albert)'s efforts to become better at speaking because of his stuttering with the support of his wife (Queen Elizabeth) and help from speech therapy (Lionel Logue).This is where the feeling of friendship between Prince Albert, Queen Elizabeth and Lionel is because Lionel is serious about helping Prince Albert recover.We can learn a lot from this film. First, a wife who always supports her husband. Second, someone who really really helps others. Third, someone who is able to rise in his worst.Interesting storyline even though there are some inappropriate words.

Must Disagree.....,"I am SO glad finally to see a film on George VI. He was a quietly brave man, who not had not speech problems. During WWII, HE knew of secrets that he could not tell anyone, except perhaps the Prime Minister, (Churchill), who knew them as well. Such things as the real horror of the concentration camps, or the real losses the British forces had suffered, etc. These things were deemed ""too horrible"" for the general populace to know. So, the King could not speak of them, not even to his own family. He died very, very young -- looking 10 years older than he was.Colin Firth looks to be great in this role. Too bad he doesn't look as much like the King, as Helena Bonham-Carter looks the queen. (George VI was SO handsome....sigh!) But the trailer has it wrong. George VI did NOT have greatness thrust upon him. He was a great man from the moment he was born!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Magnificent film!,"The King's SpeechI nearly passed on this film as I thought it less likely to be entertaining than many of the other offerings out now. In the end I'm very happy I chose to see it. This is clearly the best film I've seen this year, and I've seen all the nominated films.There is a great deal to recommend this film, beginning with impeccable direction by Tom Hooper, a marvelously written story by David Seidler and beautiful cinematography by Danny Cohen all set within the masterful framework of superb art and set direction and beautiful costumes and makeup. In fact, all of the technical aspects of this film are superb, as evidenced by the richly deserved Oscar nominations. But the real triumph may be the contribution of Nina Gold as the Casting Director. Such wonderful casting! Bravo, Nina! This is a wonderful, inspiring, life affirming journey through the tortured recesses of a man's mind as he struggles with his inner demons. It goes a long way toward proving that no station in life can totally exclude one from misery and unhappiness.Leading the way for us on this journey are two of the world's consummate actors; Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. Firth plays the tortured soul of the title on a desperate but futile search for help with a seemingly irresolvable problem. His problem is attached with a singular resolve by Rush's character, Lionel Logue, who became the King's teacher and, eventually, more.To our advantage these two fine gentlemen are joined in their efforts by the impeccably talented Helena Bonham Carter, first as the Duchess of York then as Firth's Queen consort, Elizabeth (later known as the Queen Mother).As the film unfolds, these truly talented actors play off of the selfish decisions made by the equally talented Guy Pearce in the role of Firth's cruel and insensitive older brother Edward, who is the Prince of Wales at the beginning of the film.This wonderful story then reveals some aspects of the inner workings of the British monarchy as we follow what happens when Pierce's character falls in love with the politically and socially unacceptable Wallace Simpson, a divorcée, played to a scheming turn by the talented Eve Best. Best, in fact, makes a nice study in how to make the most of a small part.When Pierce's father, Michael Gambon convincingly playing an abusive King George V, dies the crown automatically passes to his oldest son, Pearce, playing the man who became Kind Edward VIII. But King Edward's infatuation with Best's character causes an uproar among the power brokers in London who apply pressure, forcing him to abdicate in favor of his younger brother who then becomes King George VI.But George VI, who had been hoping to spend his life in blissful seclusion away from the public eye, finds himself suddenly thrust onto the limelight during one of the most terrible times in Britain's, and the world's history. George finds the duties expected of him impossible to perform due to his being afflicted with really bad stammering. His problem launches him, and us with him, on this marvelous journey to find himself within his public facade.We suffer and succeed along with Firth as he very painfully recreates George's struggles, trying with every particle of his soul to be a better king, and is, in the end, helped only by Rush's character who was found and hired by Carter's loving Elizabeth.Altogether, this film offers a marvelous ensemble cast throughout, featuring uniformly great performances from all. There's not a sour note in the lot with fine contributions by such marvelous actors as Claire Bloom and Timothy Spall, as Queen Mary and Winston Churchill respectively.I am happily satisfied that Firth and Rush have been nominated for awards along with the film. There's 12 Oscar chances to recognize this brilliant example of the modern film making art. There would be no injustice in both they and the film winning every Oscar they are nominated for.By Bruce L. Joneshttp://webpages.charter.net/bruce.jones1/",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"Truly remarkable movie,,,","If you are looking for sheer excitement, battle sequences or car chases, than this movie may not be for you.Of on the other hand you are looking for thoughtful drama, fantastic acting and historical insight this movie is IMHO without equal.Certainly helps if you know something of the history here, but I loved the audience knowledge assumptions made which meant that the audience does not feel patronized by the content.A little slow to start with, and perhaps very slightly long? IMHO It is one of those movies you need to allow yourself to be immersed in. Not simple entertainment but a highly skilled and very courageous and capable portrayal of an unprecedented, and largely secret, real life astonishing drama (British Succession), behind another astonishing drama on a worldwide scale(British leadership in WW2).The casting, screenplay, camera-work, prop/set detail and acting are simply extraordinary.My wife asked if this movie cried out for a sequel? My feeling is I would not have though it was intended, but if it did happen, and with this cast, than several ought to have an even better chance of an Oscar.Too many brilliant performances to mention.Sadly I do wonder however how much of a future in this industry lies with such wonderful full feature film works of art, as this movie was only viewed here by four people tonight!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Truly a phenomenal film,"""The King's Speech"" is simply one of the best films I've ever seen and a sure bet to walk away with a truckload of Oscars. I've never seen finer acting that that of Colin Firth as a wreck of a successor to the throne and especially Geoffrey Rush, the friend, confidant and speech therapist who was directly responsible for the combination of the rhetoric of Prime Minister Churchill and King George VI working in concert to buoy the spirits of and encourage the shell-shocked citizens of a beleaguered United Kingdom.An exceptional film in every sense.A situation that's been kept under wraps for over 80 years. A now- exposed situation that's simply too hard to believe. An astonishing film, filled with pathos and dignity--the story of a man having to fight his own demons while acting as the determined and resolute royal figurehead of a great island nation in its most perilous hour.And of course let us not forget that it was a great American leader named Franklin Roosevelt who led us through those days from a wheelchair.

"Good, solid film, lacking that magical touch","First off, I love the double meaning in the title.Secondly, I was shocked when I looked at my ticket stub going in to watch the film and noticed it was Rated R. I found out this is solely based on language (the F-bomb is dropped quite a few times).Colin Firth does an admirable job as Bertie, getting the speech, the frustrations, and the standoff nature of royalty down pat. Helena Bonham Carter I didn't like as much. She started off strong, but as the film went on, there were faces she made and things about her body language that just didn't seem to fit her character.I would recommend this film. It is especially endearing to anyone that has had some trait, some perceived flaw, that makes them self-conscious in public (and even in private). Not only was I surprised by the film's rating, but I was surprised by it's humor - and a delightful surprise it was! It helped add heart to this story.It was almost a packed house where I viewed this film and there were a few people who clapped at the end. I wasn't one of them. I liked this film, but for some reason that I am having a hard time putting my finger on, this film didn't connect with me in that magical way it did with the clappers. I was happy at the end, no doubt - a quiet, inner kind of happy - but the end seemed a bit of a letdown to me. Instead of cutting back and forth, I think I would have preferred to have simply seen things more from the perspective of the British subjects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
You will be speechless while the king speaks,"There are no mysteries in this movie to say why it keeps getting nominated in every grand awards ceremony and keep winning in a row. 'The Kings Speech' is not just a drama of any sense but something truly remarkable in its making.Story based upon the king George the VI who is suffering from dreaded case of stammer yet reluctantly and unwillingly gets the throne of England after his father pass away and his brother leaves the throne for his own personnel reasons. King George who is gravely introverted to speak in public due to his speech deficiency who has failed miserably in number of occasions before is yet to face the biggest challenges in his life when the Second World War knocks on Britain's door step sooner than expected. In the mean time the king is introduced to an Australian speech therapist Lionel Rogue who soon realizes the potential in George and takes up the challenge of making the king presentable. Amidst numerous difficulties of taming the hot blooded king and trying dozens of tricks and practices they both soon realize that they become friends more than the doctor and patient.Colin Firth who plays the king George VI is truly magnificent in his role. No second thought would rise as he walks to the Oscar stage and grab that best actor award because no one else deserves it better than him. Deeply challenging roll of a temper filled king who is faced with challenges in speech and about to drive a nation to war, Colin portray in remarkable manner. So does Geoffrey Rush a veteran in the field wonderfully plays the role of Lionel the speech specialist. These two characters mix with each other so well even though they come from totally different social backgrounds. The whole movie is one enjoyable thing to see which at one point is dramatic and one point heart breaking and then humorous when you don't expect it to be.Tom Hooper the director has achieved one amazing piece of movie with 'The Kings Speech'. Script wise it's very intelligent and never boring. Cinematographically it's a wonder to see as well. The vivid and rich details of the age old kings palaces of Britain and establishments are wonderfully opens up to you like in a fairy tale captured gracefully using wide angle lenses. Almost each scene is picture perfect and photographically correct. And the cast is well chosen and each of them plays their roll with utmost perfection and dedication.

HOWEVER, the movie was so faithful to so many aspects of his life that I was very impressed. In fact, I was blown away. The script even worked in the fact that Elizabeth did, indeed, turn George (Bertie) down twice before she finally accepted his marriage proposal.And the script brilliantly worked in when and why George's stuttering began, which is based on fact. And film emphasized how totally he was in his brother's, the Prince of Wales' shadow. And it brought out how literally besotted David was with Wallis Simpson. And how his heritage was tossed away to be with her.Every cast member was simply wonderful, or 'spot-on'. Bonham-Carter was simply wonderful and believable.

We Shall Prevail,"I believe when a movie like The King's Speech comes out, and the Academy gets ready to take a vote on Best Picture, Director, etc, they immediately pick this because of its story and its very serious tone. Some movies that get nominated for an Oscar have no chance of winning. Winter's Bone had no publicity, The Kids Are All Right, no publicity, Toy Story 3 had the animation category in the bag so that wasn't going to happen and so on.The real competition was between The King's Speech and The Social Network. I wanted The Social Network to win, but knew right after this one would take it. Do not get me wrong though. The King's Speech was a very well made film. But both The Fighter and The Social Network were stronger and more entertaining than this one. There was more excitement. That's not to say The King's Speech wasn't entertaining. It had more suddle excitement than other films it was competing against.The story is that King George V's son Albert Frederick Arthur George (later known as King George VI, played by Firth respectively) had a stammering problem where he would fumble words and the stammer would increasingly show and worsen when frustrated, mad, or upset. George sees an Australian Lionel Logue (Rush), speech therapist to try and improve his way with words. The United Kingdom is in trouble and scared about World War II approaching. They desperately need information and direction from George. He can't give direction, if he has a stammer. He needs to be relaxed and at ease, which is a big struggle.I have been questioning a lot to myself if Firth really deserved the Oscar. It was a tough year for Best Actor. Who to give it to? Franco was great in 127 Hours, Wahlberg punched and kicked his ass off in The Fighter, Jesse Eisenberg and his tech geeky self consumed me in The Social Network, and I haven't seen Biutiful or True Grit to judge Bardem and Bridges' scenes. Personally, if anyone deserves the Oscar the most, I think it's a toss up between Firth and Wahlberg. It's hard to stutter, but to be British and stutter is even harder. But to box efficiently and effectively is hard in a movie as well.The King's Speech is directed well and deserved the Oscar for the category and the costume design and musical score is composed to perfection. It doesn't feel forced, it feels relaxed, even at its most stressed moments. The story of King George VI still amazes me to this day that someone with such a bad speaking problem lived on to be a great and exceptional ruler. It truly is a remarkable story.There are points where the film is taking it slow and the voices tend to simmer. The dialog is soft, you need to listen, and sometimes you might find yourself drifting in and out of the film's storyline. But you immediately get sucked back after being in lala-land for a few seconds.George's speech We Shall Prevail is breathtaking and utterly leaves you speechless. The power in his words and his soft voice really strikes you buy surprise and may leave you questioning somethings. The King's Speech is delightful and inspiring, but still is a questionable Oscar win.Starring: Collin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter.

Lovely!,"A ""period piece"" that tells the ""true story"" of how ""King"" George VI's ascension to the throne and overcoming his speech ""impediment"", motivated by a ""strong sense of duty towards his country"", with the help of his ""considerate and loving wife"" and his ""peculiar"" speech therapist. A pure Oscar-bait film! With a huge ensemble cast (who all gave impeccable performances, particularly Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter), a predictable story of highs and lows that's impossible not to know how it ends, and Steadicam shots and fluid camerawork, it's quite clear that Hooper, Seidler and the entire crew embraced this unequivocal fact to the fullest.The film barely tries to deviate from the formula and the clichés that are linked to its sub-genre, but that's why it, seemingly conversely, doesn't seem to be a commonplace. This film is simple and that's exactly the reason why it worked very well and why it stands out above the rest of Oscar-bait films. Because this simplicity and unpretentiousness are what gave this film its incredibly genuine warm-heartedness and sheer authenticity. Even King Edward VIII, who said he has been busy ""Kinging"", is a fairly credible character, although Guy Pearce's superb performance has a role to play in making it so.

Compelling historical drama with a stellar performance from Firth,"""The King's Speech"" is the story of British king George VI (Colin Firth) and his working relationship with longtime speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Afflicted with a speech impediment from an early age, the royal's difficulties in communicating with his subjects caused him great anxiety regarding his suitability for the throne.While the subject matter may not seem overly compelling on the surface, screenwriter David Seidler did a fine job of putting the monarch's difficult situation into perspective. The advent of radio meant that the King's voice carried farther than ever before but that could be either a blessing or a curse. The turmoil surrounding the British monarchy circa the mid-1930's also serves to create a dramatic backdrop, as do the rising tensions in Europe at the time.Colin Firth deserves a lot of credit for the film's success. He invests his character with a sense of humanity, relatable to those in all walks of life. His ensuing Oscar, Golden Globe & BAFTA wins came as little surprise. Geoffrey Rush was also excellent in support, as was Helena Bonham Carter. The remainder of the well-stocked cast includes talented thespians such as Guy Pearce, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi & Timothy Spall.From a production standpoint, the film shows ample craft. The 14 BAFTA nominations & 12 Oscar nominations serve to illustrate the care put into all areas of the film, from cinematography to costume design. Director Tom Hooper won an Oscar for his distinctive contribution, while composer Alexandre Desplat's majestic score was honoured with a BAFTA award.In the end, ""The King's Speech"" proves to be an engaging film with a deft mixture of drama, wit and compassion. Its overall level of craftsmanship (not to mention Firth's fine performance) make it one of the best films of 2010.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Oscars in many categories,"The King's speech is perfect. Direction, editing, actors are Oscar worthy. Director Tom Hopper did an excellent job. Colin Firth as the Duke and then as reluctant King George VI was amazing. Geoffrey Rush as Lionel, the speech therapist without any medical degree had the demeanor and charisma of a very caring practitioner. And Helena Bonham Carter, Queen Elizabeth, as the wife of King George VI acted very well as a wife filled with love,respect, kindness and compassion for her husband's inadequacies. After a long time ( Jennifer Connelly was great as John Nash's wife in the Beautiful mind), here is a movie about a great husband wife relationship done very well. Calum Gittens , as Laurie Logue, wife of Lionel is very pleasant. The scenes where she finds the King and Queen in her home are extremely pleasant.

Brilliant film. I thoroughly enjoyed it,"It is almost impossible to fault this film. It was everything you need for an enjoyable night out at the cinema. I've seen it twice. I can remember my Mum telling me King George Vl had a speech impediment. I am just old enough to remember hearing him on the radio and, as a small child, thinking the halting way of speaking, was the correct way to make a speech. A small child would think that, as the King would lead the country in how to do things. I remember the conversation in our family when he died, how stress of being King during the war and the unexpected abdication of his brother was blamed for his early demise, rather than his smoking habit. I was rather hoping the ""bugger Bogner"" remark, which I heard were George V's last words, to come into the film. I liked the portrayal of the BBC equipment broadcasting all over the former British Empire. Westminster Abbey looked rather empty of tombs and I wondered if Peterborough cathedral might have been used for the filming. I particularly enjoyed Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of Queen Elizabeth, loyally coming out of her comfort zone and into Logan's run-down Harley Street practise to help Bertie with his speech. As a production, I loved the costumes, sets and pace of the film and can only hope there will be more UK films of this standard to look forward to.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Very honest,"For me, a parallel between The King's Speech and The Queen (2006) is very appropriate because while Stephen Frears' movie was pioneer exposing the royal family intimacy, Tom Hooper's film tries to follow - even indirectly - the same formula that made The Queen a success between critics and audience. Tom Hooper, along with screenwriter David Seidler - backed by the Weinstein brothers' experience in giving independent films necessary production to turn them into commercial successes - reached the same goal with The King's Speech. By this point of view, leaving aside the distinct themes of each one of the movies, I consider The King's Speech some kind of unofficial prequel of The Queen or, maybe, the male version of Stephen Frears' flick, but just for some similarities between both movies.Anyway, the film is successful in all aspects, from Colin Firth's visceral performance to the effective direction that seamlessly gathered traditional and conservative elements of direction with modern features of independent movies. While Tom Hooper keeps the film linear and often common, the contrast happens when he intensifies through cinematic techniques what's happening with Firth's character, making the audience feel his anguish and inability to handle his problem, making it clear by these moments that the film isn't conservative as it seems and as the critics are saying it is.Historically the movie has its merits too as most of the people didn't realize what in fact happened with the royal family in that troubled time and also how the King's problem was affecting the decisions of the monarchy and its reputation in a fragile moment when people and also other nations were heavily demanding politic responses, becoming an untenable situation.David Seidler's screenplay does a wonderful job when subtly reveals that the King wasn't unprepared for the throne, but was a person contained by his meanness feeling, believing that being a stammer was an impotence condition and not a disease that nothing had to do with his capacities. The movie grows as the audience - and also the character - starts discovering those differences and that under that voice there's a strong man able to be a respectable monarch who defies himself for the sake of his beliefs.A very honest movie. I do not consider it the best of 2010, but surely a part of the list.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The King's Speech,"The King's Speech is focused on a King of the United Kingdom, George VI and his speech therapist. They make an effort together to treat George's stammering symptom.

I love their devotion to performance and especially I was surprised at Colin's precise performance as George VI, who suffered from stammering symptom.

With clever use of language and lovable British wit, The King's Speech is some of cinema at its best.

Excellent performances all round particularly the two leads of course.A wonderful, must-see, heartfelt, period movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Witty, emotionally satisfying, and topped off with an impressive cast. The King's Speech is a success.","The film is a slow moving, but also outstanding historical feature that stars Colin Firth as Albert Frederick Arthur George (Or ""Bertie"" by his family), the Duke of York. After a lifetime of neglect, and favoritism for his older brother Edward, Bertie has developed a nervous and fearful stammer. Hoping to cure him, his wife, the future Queen Elizabeth (Played by Helena Bonham Carter), seeks the help of an unorthodox Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Played by Geoffrey Rush). The two make steady progress, and develop a strong friendship, but when Bertie's brother gives up his throne, Bertie is pushed to a true test as England is now on the brink of World War II.It's an inspiring and emotionally satisfying movie. The film is directed by Tom Hooper, who draws excellent performances out of his cast, and written by David Seidler, who draws a cohesive sense of focus between the film's narrative, and theme explorations, such as the senses of social hierarchy. It's a dramatic, witty, and passionately crafted form of art from a man who had to overcome his own stuttering problem. A personal story like that often tends to translate quite well.But the main draw of the movie is the interactions of the two unlikely friends. Colin Firth is simply excellent as George VI, continuing a hot streak that started with last year's A Single Man. He not only pulls of a convincing stutter to gain sympathy, but also draws focus to his prickly faults, such as a short fused temper, and his uncertainty in Royal placement. Rush is also pitch perfect, approaching his role with patience, sheer heart, and sharp wit. Chemistry like the kind that these two share is simply impossible to fake. The movie is also handsomely produced, especially boasting impressive production and costume design by Eve Stewart and Jenny Beavan.The King's Speech is a fine, fine film, indeed, and I give it ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
This Film Has A Lot To Say,"Overall, The King's Speech is a tremendous film about the importance of friendship and being there for anyone.

The wit and humour he brought to a serious narrative was different and it was great to watch. The writing also was superb and no surprises that it won Best Original Screenplay for the oscars that respective year.

Incredible Acting,"I saw this movie 14 years ago when it was up for Best Picture. I thought it was indeed the best movie of that year and in a rare circumstance, the academy agreed with me. I watched it again these past 2 mornings and I'm still very much impressed.The plot is nothing new. It relies on an old trope: an unorthodox teacher is called in to work with a student in need. You've seen it before in Karate Kid and Good Will Hunting just to name a few. In this case the student is Colin's Firth's Prince Albert, who is destined to be king but has a stutter that will surely undermine his reign especially since, in the 1930's, radio is now becoming ubiquitous and a king's eloquence is as essential as how he looks on the throne. The teacher is Geoffrey Rush, a failed and frustrated actor who does speech therapy to make ends meet. Will the newly crowned King be able to deliver a critical speech to his nation on the brink of World War II? That's the friction that propels this movie forward. Not exactly can't-look-away drama.So while the storyline is a bit predictable, it's the crisp dialogue and incredible acting that raises this film to its heights. Besides the two leads, who are always remarkable, the rest of the cast is amazing, especially Helena Bonham Carter as Firth's ever supportive wife.If you need explosions and flying superheroes to be suitably entertained, skip this one. If you can appreciate great acting and skillful writing, you'll enjoy The King's Speech. I gave it 8 out of 10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

The Majestic Roar of THE KING'S SPEECH,"As a document of a little known history of pre-World War II England, The King's Speech is a fascinating, heart rending dramatization of King George VI, who assumed the throne despite a debilitating speech problem at a time when his country needed him the most. Well directed by TV veteran Tom Hooper (John Adams) from a lifelong project by screenwriter David Seidler, it boasts Colin Firth's (Bridget Jones Diary, A Single Man) best performance as the beleaguered king and award caliber support by Geoffrey Rush (Shine, Elizabeth) and Helena Bonham Carter (Alice in Wonderland, Room With a View).In 1925, Prince Albert (Colin Firth), who is second in line to the throne, gives a speech through BBC radio at Wembley Stadium in England, and it goes poorly as he hesitates and stumbles his words much to the astonishment of the crowd. He has a stuttering problem that is revealed in the most public and humiliating way. By the 1930's in London, Albert is subjected to a multitude of therapies and remedies that range from speaking with a mouthful of marbles to smoking! His frustration grows until he abandons any hope of solving his affliction. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), seeks out an obscure, Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who feels confident he can cure the prince. A struggling actor himself, Logue has a playful sense of humor that does not ingratiate himself with the future King of England. It is a humbling process, but he slowly brings the prince out of his timid and isolated shell. They work on a progression of methods which includes utilizing recordings and headphones and delves into Albert's childhood. The therapy sessions are not without setbacks but a bond develops into a strong friendship. As 1936 approaches, King George V dies, and when The Prince of Wales (Guy Pierce) abdicates the throne to be with an American divorcée, the title and responsibility fall on Prince Albert who is desperate not to be placed in this position when England needs a leader. As the clouds of war approach Europe, Prince Albert is named King George VI on December 12, 1936. With England on the brink of declaring war on Germany, and a radio broadcast to all of England and the world, George summons Logue to coach him through the most important speech of his life. With Logue at his side to guide his every word, George speaks to the nation.Hooper does a very straightforward job without having to resort to flashy camera-work but instead lets his actors do what they do best-act! This long gestating screenplay started with Seidler as a child stutterer listening to radio broadcasts of the king, and it was not until his widow, the Queen Mother, died that he had her conditional consent to tackle the story. It does play a bit with facts but never loses sight of the core relationship of the two disparate men and how a common actor taught a prince to be king. Technical production is excellent all around from the impressive period costumes and art direction to the dramatic score and dark hued cinematography.It is the interplay and war of wills between Firth and Rush that is the delicious center of this relationship based story. Reunited after having costarred in Shakespeare in Love, both actors are at the top of their game, and part of the fun is that despite the seriousness of the therapy, there are humorous moments to savor. Carter plays 'less is more' in one of her more conventional roles, and she is quite convincing as royalty. Some nice turns are made by acting royalty, Michael Gambon, Guy Pierce, Derek Jacobi, and Claire Bloom among others.The story adds texture in the family details by revealing George V as a domineering father. The troubles of George VI are shown in intimate scenes with his children as he tries to read a story but is handicapped by his impediment. The documentary footage of Hitler's mastery of public speaking is studied with fascination and almost envy by George. It is an ironic yet telling scene. Logue adores his own family, and his down to earth persona is in sharp contrast to George VI's more formal yet heartfelt affections for his family. There is a good contrast made of the King's life from that of the common man. In the scene where George VI is crowned King, he must address his court and realizes that everyone, even his own family, will now treat him differently. Life will never be the same again. When George VI makes his speech at the end, we see that he is learning to be a king.As a piece of history, The King's Speech is thoroughly engaging, but what makes it affecting is one man's triumph over adversity with the support of a loving wife and the friendship of a unique therapist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Did I Stutter?,"I will echo what a few of the other reviews on here have said. The performances are solid but that is sort of where my enjoyment began and ended. This movie isn't particularly interesting and when you consider that Tom Hooper was the director, it becomes much clearer why. The butcher of Les Miz and the man solely responsible for making a mockery of Cats (cough), somehow continues to be entrusted with art pieces to the detriment of all ticket buyers. The pacing is slow and though the film isn't particularly long, it felt like it was. Colin Firth does a fantastic job, but I believe that Geoffrey Rush is the unsung hero here, employing what I call the ""Rain Man"" effect. Dustin Hoffman received all the accolades for his portrayal of the autistic brother in that movie, but I would venture to say that Tom Cruise had the more difficult assignment playing the straight man next to a far more flamboyant role. The same is true of Rush in The King's Speech. Firth has the more dynamic character and he deserves the praise he received, but it is Geoffrey Rush's calm and steadfast Logue that holds this story together. Helena Bonham Carter is always good, but I don't see anything exceptional in this role that warranted an Academy Award nomination. Overall, I would say that it was a slow year for the Academy if this is what passed for a Best Picture in 2010.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

This is how exceptional acting can make a movie brilliant!,"Before watching this for the first time, and yes this was the first out of many and certainly not the last, I was kind of skeptical of the plot. A King who has a problem making public appearances sounded kind of boring to me, but man was I wrong about that.This movie is from the very beginning an exceptional study in how great lead and supporting acting can make a rather insignificant story to become much more than that. First of all a much well deserved Oscar to Colin Firth for the lead role as the King, his acting as a speech-impaired prince/king actually makes the viewer absolutely speechless and he makes you feel for the character (even though he is a King and all that :-)). He could have carried the movie all by himself with mediocre performances by the rest and it would still be a great movie. However, Geoffrey Rush and Helena B. Carter supports him to perfection, I would have liked to see at least one Oscar going that way as well.I think that many others have done a fine job in reviewing this movie and explaining the historical background of the movie, so I will not bore you with that.Will only say that if you are a fan of watching a well written scrip combined with world class acting, then you already have your answer of whether or not to watch this movie - It's a sure MUST see and maybe see again, think it will move you every time.This movie has it all - key points are obviously superb acting, good scenes of humor, lots of brilliant emotional scenes, nice script flow. Only explanation to why this movie is not rated higher in top 250 movies on IMDb is the fact that the story itself is maybe not that appealing to some people (including my prejudices before watching it). The acting really does the job and because of that a well deserved Best Picture of the year award was indisputable!

A King Finds His Voice.,"The King's Speech transcends the typical historical drama. It's a poignant exploration of overcoming adversity, wrapped in the elegance of pre-war Britain. Colin Firth delivers an Oscar-worthy performance as King George VI, a man burdened by a debilitating stammer and the weight of a nation on his shoulders.His unlikely hero is Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an unorthodox speech therapist who breaks through the royal protocol to forge a genuine connection with the king. Their sessions are a masterclass in acting, filled with humor, frustration, and ultimately, a deep respect.The film doesn't shy away from the king's struggles.

The emotional power of Beethovens 7th,"There are a lot of films about the English royal family. To name just a few: ""The madness of King George"" (1994, Nicholas Hytner) about George III and ""The Queen"" (2006, Stephen Frears) about Elizabeth II, the daughter of George VI.""The Kings speech"" is about King George VI. When his father George V dies, his elder brother Edward VIII succeeds his father. When Edward VIII however wants to marry a twice divorced woman, the Angelican church (of which the King is head) does not approve. Within a year Edward VIII abdicates and his younger brother becomes King George VI. George VI however has a stutter handicap and this is rather annoying when giving a speech. It is even disastrous when one has to declare war, and in the meantime the tension with Nazi Germany is rising.Was it not more abvious to make a movie about the forbidden romance of Edward VIII than about the stutter handicap of George VI? After watching the film this is no longer a question. Beating his handicap is for George VI gaining a victory over himself, and watching him fighting for this victory is more exciting than seeing Indiana Jones beating seven dragons.The climax of the film is of course the declaration of war. In an earlier scene George had watched, with a certain amount of jealousy, a speech by Adolf Hitler. When his daughter asks what that strange man is saying, he answers ""I don't know, but ... he seems to be saying it rather well"".The declaration of war scene is very cleverly cut. One alternately sees King George making his speech and diverse audiences. In the first place of course his wife and members of the administration, anxious to know if the King wil manage to deliver the speech fluently, but also audiences around the World.It is however not the editing but the music of Beethovens 7th that gives this scene a tremendous emotional power. Seldom had film music been chosen so precisely.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Nutshell Review: The King's Speech,"Interest is always high on the British monarch and the next big thing on the agenda is the wedding ceremony between Prince William and Kate Middleton. The countless of biographies available make natural adaptation into compelling films, from more period The Other Boleyn Girl to the two Elizabeth films by Shekhar Kapur and even something more contemporary such as Stephen Frear's The Queen. These films are deeply rooted in familiar history as they snapshot a period of time during the respective monarch's reign, not to mention the characters that come and go during the period, both famous and infamous. In The King's Speech, I'm rather surprised that the many subplots put in were purposeful, and tells a bigger story about how King George VI ascended the throne due to circumstances, rather than just a story that's obsessively focused on his speech issues.Played by Colin Firth, King George VI before he became King of England in the late 30s, was the Duke of York whose inability in speaking publicly because of his stammer meant being kept under wraps and outshone by his brother, the heir apparent to the throne (Guy Pearce), and much to the disappointment of their father King George V (Michael Gambon) since the former is deep in controversy himself, having to consort with a commoner who's soon to be twice divorced (Wallis Simpson, played by Eve Best). It's actually because of this abdication that the current royal lineage is where it's at now, and for the uninitiated, here's that bit of historical trivia for you since this film goes back four generations and has plenty of character cameos such as Winston Churchill (Timothy Spall) during his pre-Prime Ministership days.No thanks to the advancement of radio and broadcast technology that had inevitably shamed the big man in public, the Duchess of York (Helena Bonham Carter) persistently sets her husband up with doctors to cure him of his impediment, only for her efforts to finally reach Lionel Logue (Rush), a speech therapist whose methods are most unorthodox, although his results speak for themselves. But like in any teacher-student relationship, success all depends on the efforts and determination of the student, and this isn't easy when someone is of a higher social standing than oneself, and believes in that standing from time to time coupled with an impatiently fiery temper borne out of countless of frustrating years.Two big reasons why you must absolutely watch The King's Speech - Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. Two of some of the best in the business outside of America, they give pitch perfect performances and share that slick chemistry to make their characters' relationship, from mentor to student, healer to the ill, royalty and subject, and finally friends, all the more delightful to sit through that progress. It's a solid story on friendship, and David Seidler's tale covers amazing ground in its narrative space, going both both breadth and depth, with nice little reveals at appropriate times to bring about some emotional power punches, be it Lionel's wife Myrtle (Jennifer Ehle) stumbling upon her VIP guests, or that conversation between experience and paper qualifications, something I think which will hit home here as well.Firth makes his stammer believable and you feel sorry for him being thrust into the limelight when he's really not ready for it, worried to bungle it up and to become an embarrassment to his nation. It is this fighting of his own personal battle that becomes a beacon and an inspiration to his subjects and countrymen to conquer their own fears and uncertainty, and of course to stand up to the dark forces clouding Europe at the time. You'll feel every inch of his frustration at his predicament, and the skepticism toward Lionel Logue's methods which to him doesn't seem to solve the issue at hand.Tom Hooper, who directed The Damned United and had similar themes involving a maverick's attempt to excel and inspire, definitely knows a thing or two about putting a successful partnership on screen, and Geoffrey Rush proves to be that perfect counterpunch to Firth's King, whose pitch perfect enunciation of the English language lacked heart, which of course is the opposite of that in King George VI. What I also enjoyed is Hooper not employing tactics which other directors may employ in either fading to black at the critical crescendo built up or having the actual speech played while the credits rolled, providing something effective in reminding us that it's the process, and not the destination, that proves to be of importance and a highlight.It's a tough one to choose between The Social Network and The King's Speech come Oscar season, but between the two, this one has a more inspiring, uplifting and positive tale about friendship, while the former touches on the destructive nature that success brings about amongst friends which is quite ironic given the creation of a world-beating social network that's supposed to promote communication and interaction between friends. I suppose it depends on what mood the voters are in when they cast their vote, but if given a choice, The King's Speech would be mine. Highly recommended, so don't miss this on the big screen!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

This is my first feeling after watching the movie, I know he is an ordinary person, with the same emotions as ordinary people, facing the changes of the country, his own stammer, George vi was under great pressure, thanks to a good doctor, a good friend to face with him.

"The King's Speech combines well-balanced elements of comedy, tension, romance, history and drama and provides the best movie in 2010","What an extraordinary piece of filmmaking. Tom Hooper took the interesting story of King George VI of Britain (Colin Firth) struggle for regaining trust in his own voice. Knowledgeable of King George's stammer, his wife, Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) appealed to some local and relatively unknown speech therapist by the name of Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). As a short history brief I could add that the Duke of York by the real name of Albert Frederick Arthur George became King of Britain not after the death of his father (King George V) but because of his brother's (King Eduard VIII) discharge or abdication of the duties as king and emperor. The story itself is well proportioned, the narrative linear structure is intelligently mannered and the dialogue is just captivating. I loved the pacing in this movie because it doesn't get slow or dull nor quickly and forgettable. It's a perfect achievement in terms of filmmaking and it's definitely one of the best pictures of 2010 if not the best. As the movie tag is saying, it takes leadership to confront a nation's fear and It takes friendship to conquer your own. King George has to regain not only confidence in his own voice and personality but also has to regain a lost friendship. A friendship he didn't had since his childhood days. He finds that special friend in his speech therapist who is a brilliant psychologist and a great human being. Although the story may sound for some people to be another royal-drama this is obviously not the case. The King's Speech combines well-balanced elements of comedy, tension, romance, history and drama. It succeeds by not focusing too much on just one character but let all of them be more than just screen-puppets. Be relevant pupper-masters that could steal the audience in any scene. Great craft, intensely intelligent and gallantly mannered, King's Speech is one of the finest products of comedic-biopic ever made.Of course, for a movie to be brilliant you need brilliant acting besides brilliant screenplay and dialogue. And I admit, sometimes the screenplay, the story, could build a character more than his acting but this movie is one of the exceptions. Colin Firth does an outstanding job portraying the hardly King George VI. He looses himself completely into the king's personality. He somehow manages to both interact and disagree with his own character. His mannerism, his tonality, his impeccable eloquence and elegance is by far the outstanding piece of acting this year and Colin Firth deserves his Academy Award after his first nomination last year for ""A Single Man"". The secondary roles however are not to be forgotten. Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue are both dueling with his majesty in terms of acting and they greatly succeed. A great complementary casting in these two wonderful and talented actors. Geoffrey Rush is more of a comedian than a serious therapist and manages to make the audience enjoy his character while Helena Bonham Carter represents the aristocratic fanciness in that period of time.The entire staff should get recognition for the beautiful and imposing cinematography. It's a perfect combination between two contradicting feelings within King's personality: claustrophobia and liberation. The anti-thesis in this movie is perfectly shown thanks to the beautiful shots and even the chosen contrasts. The decors are also part of this sublime description of our main character by combining complexity with simplicity. Elegance with rustiness. Although all these technical details are pretty good and help to create a worm and comfortable atmosphere, the most incredible thing to me is the music I'm hearing while watching the film. Alexandre Desplay is guilty for providing the best original score this year. I'm sorry for The Social Network or Inception but this is pure music. This piece of astonishing and captivating music is on another level for me as a solid cinefile that I like to believe I am. I had goose bumps just listening the melody in the first 2-3 minutes for the movie and I was already amazed and dazzled.What more can I possibly say?... The King's Speech is, if not the best, then definitely one of the best movie released in 2010 and one of the best comedic-biopics ever. I still judge this movie as being more a drama/comedy type of movie than being strict and choose just one genre which would be drama.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

The king and his wife visit many doctors to overcome the problem, but his stutter does not get well. One day, they meet a doctor, Geoffrey Rush, and the king overcome his problem thanks to Geoffrey's unique treatment. This movie is very moving.

A Masterpiece,"This is based upon a true story.Before Prince Albert of York (Firth) ascended the throne of England,as King George VI, he had hired Lionel (Rush) a speech therapist to help him overcome his stammering when he had to speak publicly for official functions. Then he becomes king, and is terrified as he knows he will have to address the nation verbally.When something is almost perfect it is hard to know where to start. Everything flowed flawlessly.The acting by all was sheer perfection. Colin Firth was perfect imparting his fears to all of us. We felt for him and we cared, cared deeply. We were like his family cringing, hoping for the best, knowing it wouldn't go well, and were helpless to do more than give support and, in some cases, holding back tears.Thank God for radio. If television was around at that time, this would probably not have gone as well. Imagine having to speak to the entire population with a camera in your face and you feared stammering, stuttering and losing the confidence of your country, and there is no place to hide. Yikes ! Keep in mind that Hitler and Germany were on the rise and the threat of war was very real. So radio saved the day and the monarchy.The Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (Firth) were well deserved. Other than a very touching, and heartfelt story, the thing I came away with most is this: now I know who Colin Firth is. Great job.

Comical and Moving Friendship,"King George VI suffers from stammer so he does not like to make speech. His wife worries about that and calls for doctors specialized in it. But all of the doctors cannot get rid of his stammer. King George VI loses his temper and comes to dislike doctors. One day his wife make an appointment with an Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue. King George VI sees him and is angry with his rude behavior. He tries to go back home but Lionel says to him that he stakes 1 shilling on possibility that King George VI can speak fluently. He accepts it and reads out the story written by Shakespeare loudly listening to music. He cannot hear his own voice, though, he thinks he was not able to speak and goes home with angry. Later he listens to the record and he is surprised at his own eloquent voice. After that he trusts Lionel and starts the therapy. That is the way they make close friends.I like the characters of this film, especially Lionel. He is apparently rude but this is his way he communicates with patients. He relieves others' mind by talking frankly. I like such an attitude very much. If there are doctors who are like him, I also see them.This film is based on the real story of the relationship between King George VI and Lionel. I think it is brilliant and moving.

The King's Speech- A Fantastic Movie,"I went into this movie with very high expectations, with it winning Best Picture and all, and I am pleased to say I was very impressed. The acting was phenomenal, especially from Colin Firth playing the stammering King perfectly. Personally, I do not think this movie deserved Best Picture, but it was in no means a poor film. I just thought there were better movies out there, such as 127 Hours, Inception, and Toy Story 3.Let me start out by talking about the amazing performance by Colin Firth. While he was stammering, you honestly felt sorry for him just because you could see in his face that he was trying to get the words out, trying so hard. When he got very frustrated, I really could feel his frustration because he couldn't get his words out.Helena Bonham Carter was brilliant, as usual. It was very odd seeing her in a completely different role, seeing her as the over-the-top Queen in Alice in Wonderland and the frightening Bellatrix Lestrange from the Harry Potter series. I really enjoyed her performance.Geoffrey Rush was another great performance, although not as incredible as Colin Firth's. He was very convincing as a do-as-I-say speech therapist, but nothing special.Overall, you will not be disappointed with The King's Speech. I encourage you to go see it, no matter if you are young or old. I am thirteen and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.Just as a side note, I did not know why this movie was rated R. The F-word was said many times, but not in a nasty manner, just as a speech therapy tool. It deserved a PG-13 Rating, at best. Thank you!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"A personal and historical drama, humanly rendered and skillfully interpreted","The story of George VI, of his meek nature and his stammer may sound not so familiar to the great public, but the picture by Tom Hooper captures and appeals thanks to the humanity and the warmth it's rendered through. I do not know how much historical precision there is in the story itself, certainly the overall historical background is displayed vividly, in a period where the English monarchy began to change, due to the radio and the appearance of the royalty on the screen, which made them more near to the subjects, revealing their weaknesses to them as never had happened before. The movie gets to dose and perch the historical drama on one hand with the personal inner drama of the King and his relationship with his speech therapist on the other. This last may sound too predictable, too cinematographic in its development, but certainly the talent of Colin Firth and still more of Geoffrey Rush (whose interpretation appears as truly generous), helps make it always believable and likely. Also Helena Bonham Carter delivers a heartfelt interpretation, and in general the whole cast contributes to the high quality of the movie and to a deeply human vision of the themes dealt with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The Story of a King Who was destined for greatness. But needed a little help getting there.,The King's Speech is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It is a modern day classic. The Story takes place over a number of years. The Duke of York has a stammer and he hates speaking in public. His father King George the V bullies him into it as it is one of his duties. Bertie as the Duke is called is filled with fear every time he is called to do so. His wife Elizabeth takes matters into her own hands and locates a man who might help him. Lionel Logue is a would be actor who helps people overcome speech difficulties. His methods are unique. Logue however doesn't get pushed very easily nor is he impressed easily. In their first meeting he Tells Bertie after Bertie tries to push Royal attitude on him Logue smiles and tells him My Castle my rule. This sets up the ground work for their relationship. Logue informs him he will need to see him everyday. The next few years are filled with historical life changing events. Bertie is thrust into a situation he doesn't want. King George V is dying and his brother who is having a affair with a divorced woman Wallis Simpson is chosen to be the next King. When Edward becomes King and finds out that this life interferes with his happiness he leaves the throne. Suddenly Bertie is Thrust into the position of becoming King George The 6th. As Bertie assumes the throne his relationship with Logue changes and Berties discovers just how much help he really needs and not just with his speech. England is about to go to War. And The newly Crowned King must make a speech. The Speech is to unite England as one and to spur them onto victory. The First Speech becomes a incredible success. And King George the 6th becomes a symbol of resistance against the Nazi war machine. I was surprised to find out that King George the 6th and Logue continued their friendship. This movie made me feel like cheering in the end and it kept my attention and to be honest I Will watch it again.

"A tale of friendship, family and the beauty of language","In 1924, the new invention of radio gives King George V his first opportunity to address his people all around the world. For the monarch and his subjects, it is a great and historic moment; for his second son, Prince Albert Duke of York, it is a nightmare. Albert, or ""Bertie"" as he is referred to by his family, suffers from a crippling stammer, one that makes his duties at court difficult, and the task of public speaking nearly impossible. In desperation, his wife Duchess Elizabeth reaches out to Lionel Logue, an Australian speech therapist living in London, whose unorthodox methods may be the future king's final hope. The subject matter may seem low-key, and the stakes likewise rather minuscule, but director Tom Hooper, with the considerable help of his first rate cast, turns this seemingly unremarkable real life tale of a stuttering king into a film filled with emotion and gentle humour, and one that is an absolute pleasure to watch.Although The King's Speech is set in the world of royalty, the heart of the film deals with far less grandiose, far more human themes. Early sequences introduce us to the Prince and his loving wife and young daughters, while the eventual friendship between the stammering monarch and his quirky doctor forms the backbone of the plot. Amusing and often very touching, scenes like these are also lent an intimate feel thanks to the films warm cinematography and production design; by contrast, low angles and elaborate formal costumes dominate scenes of regality, making it easy to understand why Bertie feels so intimidated and overwhelmed. In every scene, Hooper is able to capture, with sometimes just a single shot, the tone of the setting. Likewise, Alexandre Desplat beautiful score imbues the film with a charm and grace in some moments, majesty and circumstance in others.The acting in The King's Speech is uniformly superb. Obvious difficulties of affecting a speech impediment aside, Firth's work as the stammering King is spectacularly moving, sympathetic and filled with relatable frustration. Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter are almost as impressive – the former is endlessly likable as Lionel Logue, while Carter plays her role as Bertie's wife the Duchess of York with the perfect combination of love, restraint and the slightest of superiority. Beyond these leading three, Guy Pierce and Michael Gambon are both believable and intensely unpleasant as the sniveling Prince of Wales and the domineering George V, and the rest of the cast is filled out nicely by veteran British character actors including Derek Jacobi and Timothy Spall.The King's Speech has already been labeled by some as typical awards-bait; the kind of formulaic dramatic picture that Academy members can safely vote for over more energetic or perhaps interesting films. Admitedly, there are one or two lines of dialogue that felt a little overly inspirational, and a few character decisions that seem to serve drama rather than common sense (as well as a rather glaring plot flaw that, had any characters acknowledged it, would have rendered the tension in the climax non-existent). However, these moments are few and far between, and although the film may prove the easy choice come Oscar night, that seems an unfair criticism to level against the men and woman who strived to make this film such a good one. And as a tale of friendship, family and the beauty of language, The King's Speech is certainly that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"A very true, true story","As a, former stammerer, this film made my cry all the way through. It's played so well by Colin Firth as he gets the stammer so realistic.Supporting cast are spot on too.Brilliant film which I've watched a number of times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Society messes everyone up!,"Powered by three great central performances this dry, witty film is an interesting take on how societal expectations and roles greatly mess people up. Bertie's stutter only mattered because his job is mainly public speaking. This theme goes throughout most the characters-Lionel as an Australian is viewed a certain way, Edward can't live his love because of his social role, etc. There's that great speech about how kings have been degraded by becoming actors by George 5th. The screenplay is smartly observed on this point and you don't notice the depth the first time you watch it.That is because you are mostly engaged in a very charming story of male friendship that is at once moving and funny. The interplay between Bertie and Lionel is great; Rush and Firth have a great chemistry. The film really does out like a buddy dramedy and it make the social themes embedded in a very intimate story. The script is quite good.But Hooper's direction is really what makes the film. The script could have been too dry, too self-serious. But by keeping the tone light and avoiding royal trappings Hooper does the near impossible-make a monarch seem like an everyman. The way Bertie is (literal) marginalized in the frame, with anti-classical framing that slowly transmutes into strong, centered composition as Bertie finds his voice is understated but keeps the film alive. It is just amazing direction.That Hooper also got 3 of the very best performances just solidifies this. Carter has a gentle toughness that works as the Queen's mum and she is dutifully supportive. Rush tones down his normal mannerism to give, for him, a restrained performance that nevertheless makes Lionel a great eccentric. But best of all is Firth, in what is his career defining performance. He not only stammers beautifully but he emotes with (or past) the stammer. He makes Bertie stand apart from George the 6th. It is just a great performance.A Great film around!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

A speech worth waiting for,"I love it, watching two great actors strut their stuff, and here Rush and the amazing Firth don't drop their stuff. I have to admit, I enjoyed this movie, full of great memorable scenes and performances, more than I thought I would. It really got me in, and it's true. Set around the time of the Hitler regime, Firth, next in line for King, must first overcome his stammering, where again, as recalling one Aussie Idol contestant, who had a stuttering impairment, we see what an amazing part music, or singing can play, into eradicating this problem, here it'sa music from a turn table. With Daddy on his deathbed, Firth, such a stubborn character, is sent to a speech therapist, the solid flawless Rush, who slowly delves into the why's, and cracks at the root of the problem, Firth's disfavored childhood, and we'll feel so sorry for him. His selfish, aristocratic younger brother, Pearce, is up for the throne too. Pearce kind of tries too hard with his role, and sort of comes off artificial, while Helena Bonham Carter, such a great actress, mlends fine support as Firth's wife, where Timothy Spall and Anthony Andrews add memorably solid, in smaller supporting parts, especially Spall. And then there's the speech, the greatest and memorably high point scene, wonderfully recreated, as too the first rate set. Essentially it's Firth's movie, and he has you at every scene, in a amazingly brilliant performance, worth the ticket of admission alone. Essential viewing. Rush's digs, is so cool.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Powerful movie,"The Kings Speech moved me strongly. I used to have a pretty bad stutter problem, so I could really understand George.You could ask what all the fuss is about. It's only about a man who has a hard times pronouncing words, and also the royal house is so distant. Why should we care and why should this story be told? I think the story is relevant because it is very basic. George wants his father to love him, but every time he opens his mouth, he proves what a failure he is. Still, we can see he is a decent man. I liked that. I also liked Elizabeth. They have a happy marriage and wonderful kids, and it is of great comfort to the viewer as well as to George himself.Geoffrey Rush plays an unconventional speech therapist. He is from a different walk of life, a con artist, but they eventually develop a friendship that carries the movie to the end. That is when George has to declare war on Nazi Germany. Broadcasted to the entire civilized world. You know the rest and I did, too. But still it touched me to the bone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

The King's Speech is from time to time a rather slow movie filled with moments where you get both know the characters but also the magnificent things about this movie; the script, the filming and how the actors collaborate upon creating great scenes.Director Tom Hooper, in my opinion, succeeded with The King's speech.

Little told piece of history,"Just saw this movie, Firth & Rush should get an Oscar for their performances. It was well directed, produced & well cast. Maybe the Winston Churchill character was a bit of a push; not by much & the rest of the actors did very well in their characters.The movie didn't drag in the very least, it moved right along. The viewer is well informed of the dynamics of mostly of these two characters, the King (George the VI) and the therapist. They are pushed together mostly out of desperation, on the Kings part, but also by a sense of servitude on the therapist's.The movie centers on a very dramatic time in the world. A monarchy that has ruled a large part of the world, an impending World War II and the shake up, that gets thrown into the lap of a man who barley saw it coming.It was again, a very well scripted movie; it has elements of comedy, drama, suspense.

The power of acting,"The performances from everyone in this film were excellent, down to the extras and uncredited actors playing ""the common man"" with such poignancy at a time when Britain faced its darkest hour of the 20th century. It's also about the acting that the new King had to learn, just to become the monarch at that stage in history, when the ""wireless"" was the means of communication and the king was forced to speak into a microphone without being able to see any of his audience, or more terrifyingly, a huge crowd hanging on his every word. He had to lead his people and inspire them, and I believe that he did so in real life as well. Public speaking can be an ordeal, even for those of us who are not cursed with a speech impediment. Imagine the hell it became for a man with a dreadful stammer who had hoped to avoid being king and who had been taunted as a child because of it, who was suddenly thrust into this role by his selfish, feckless older brother. It's such a great story and the fact that it is true makes it more powerful still. It has charm and humour, I laughed and cried all the way through. The rehearsal scene in the Abbey just before the coronation was like a stage rehearsal or an audition for the RSC - so unexpected.I don't think the film is over-rated and all deserve the awards they have won. I would also like to mention the music. The original score was lovely, but the use of Beethoven was masterful, especially the 7th symphony at a climactic moment. Even though it was German music, it was absolutely right and very moving.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
superb in every way,"This is just a marvelous film with a gripping sense of history, about a little-known story. Albert, Duke.of York ('Bertie' to his family) had a severe speech impediment, which wasn't really an issue until he had to assume the throne on the abdication of his selfish playboy brother Edward, Duke of Windsor. A monarch really has to be able to lead his people through language. An unlicensed speech therapist from Australia, Lionel Logue, worked with Bertie (King George VI) throughout his life. Everything about this movie, the acting, the script, the dramatic flow, is superb, and I am happy to see Edward portrayed as the jerk he was (although the movie avoids the subject of his - and his wife's - pro-Nazi sympathies). This is amust-see movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Just an amazing feel-good film!,"I'm not going to lie. I went to watch this for all the praise it has been getting. I went to the opening day in Mexico and it was nice to see some older audience for a change.That being said, i had really high expectations that were met. I knew beforehand the acting was going to be top notch, but i was still dazzled. Colin Firth couldn't have done any better and he really deserves all the awards he's getting; i mean, his stammering was just perfect. Helena Bonham Carter was great as well, and as i'm used to watch her as Bellatrix Lestange in the Harry Potter films (i'm a huge fan of Harry Potter), it was nice to see her being so nice for a change.Speaking about that, i loved all the British cast present that have been on Harry Potter before, such as Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon (which was extraordinary as George V, and i believe he does great on this film as so of Dumbledore), Timothy Spall (i do like him, although it was hard imagining him as Churchill. Love him as Peter Pettigrew though).ANd then, of course, Geoffrey Rush. Personally, i only knew him from Pirates of the Caribbean, and thought he did great there and was so funny. Well... here he did 20 times greater and 50 times funnier. I haven't seen The fighter, but i believe Geoffrey should take home the best supporting actor. He was just amazing for me, and i laughed countless times.Now, even though the story was predictable at times, it didn't take anything from the film at all. The whole film had a great pacing and in no need of any kind of visual effects or action scenes, which is a great thing. The basic plot was engaging and a really motivational fear to top your flaws or in spite of them just do something majestic.I went out of the theater smiling, and it was no surprise to see people clapping at the end of the film.So deserving of all the praise, and hope it sweeps the big awards at the Oscars. And don't get me wrong, i loved social network, black swan, inception, toy story 3, but this just takes the cake for me, for how good of a feel-good film it is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Ranks among the best films of the year,"While some may say 2010 has been a year where many films have disappointed, I have no doubt in saying The King's Speech is a film that delivers what it promises. Expertly directed with a perfect cast, there is no reason not to see this film.This is somewhat uplifting (it is after-all about a speech preparing a nation for war) film that has been carefully made to ensure the audience never lose interest in the events on-screen because there have been many films that deal with overcoming problems to the point where most are clichéd and generic. The King's Speech keeps things feeling fresh and exciting from the use of humour and dramatic moments.Colin Firth gives another fantastic performance after A Single Man but I found this one to be more interesting. A Single Man was a good film and Firth gave a solid performance but this is the one he will be remembered for. The supporting cast are also fantastic, which includes Helena Bonham-Carter, Timothy Spall, Michael Gambon and the brilliant Geoffrey Rush.Every aspect of the film is perfect, making The King's Speech not only one of the best British films but one of the best films of the year.

Believable portrayals and original subject matter make a gripping historical film.,"Fantastically believable portrayal of the stuttering King George VI and his journey to overcome that challenge to lead his country in a difficult time.I thought I had an idea of what somebody would do to portray stuttering... and luckily Colin Firth did something different and so much better. Geoffrey Rush as the perceptive, bold but caring speech therapist actually portrayed calm and peace and belief in ""Bertie""... actually giving us an emotional connection much like the real George VI must have experienced.The backdrop of the building Nazi invasion and World War II provides the tension for the importance of the challenge. George VI thrust into a position he did not desire (due in part to his public speaking difficulties) is rough enough, but in the kind of situation so fraught with peril is terrifying. Colin Firth imbues George VI with a sense of ""realness"" allowing us to connect with his sadness, his anger & frustration, his fears.Not much to criticize, it felt like a masterpiece the entire way through. Many times great movies are not highly repeatable for the difficult subject matter, or painful emotions they drag us through. This movie is also difficult to watch but because of something entirely new to me -- stammering. It really is hard to see such struggle with something most of us take for granted.

A classic inspirational film!,"The King's Speech is an exceptional depiction of a man's struggle with a deeply entrenched imperfection, and his unrelenting perseverance to overcome it. This inspiring film is based on a true story, and truly captivates and empowers the audience. The theme of the movie is never fear the challenge of overcoming a limitation, no matter how debilitating, because a strong resolve can produce amazing results.Written by David Seidler and directed by Tom Hooper, this film articulates the true story of King George VI of England and his stuttering problem that appeared to be incapacitating. King George VI, with the assistance of his wife Elizabeth, seeks help in defeating this weakness through a local commoner, resulting in an amazing journey and unlikely friendship. The film contains a stellar cast including Colin Firth as the Duke of York and King George VI, Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth the wife of King George VI, and Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue the speech therapist. The supporting cast includes Guy Pearce as David the brother of King George VI and Michael Gambon as George V.The film begins with the first speech given by the Duke of York at the Empire Exhibition closing ceremony in Wembley London in 1925. He is visibly uneasy when preparing to give the speech and this anxiety is magnified by the confidence and preparation shown by the BBC announcer in the same sequence, who is broadcasting the speech. The atmosphere is very dreary, grim, dark, and cold, utilizing mainly black and blue colors from the clothing to the buildings. This color and lighting scheme conveys the depressing nature of his predicament, as well as the frustration and misery the Duke feels. The disappointing delivery of the Duke's speech is evident by his constant stammering and the discouraging look on his face, and the faces of the audience. Shortly after, the Duke and his wife are seen at a doctor's office receiving unsuccessful and maddening treatment for his speech impediment, by a physician with inaccurate knowledge of the causes and remedies for the condition. The Duke then reaches a breaking point in dealing with his impediment, expressing his unwillingness to seek any further therapy. His wife, Elizabeth, then obtains a referral to speech therapist Lionel Logue, who provides unorthodox and controversial, yet promising services, and hires him immediately. The film proceeds with the trials and triumphs of the Duke's wrestling with his disability publicly and privately, as well as the release of years of pain, frustration, and torment over it by himself and those closest to him. Despite the ridicule of his older brother David and the overbearing badgering of his father George V, the Duke continues to employ the services of Mr. Logue in his fight to conquer his speech impediment.After the death of George V, David is given the throne, but relinquishes it to marry the woman he desires. This pushes the Duke of York to the head of the country, forcing him to completely tackle his condition so that he may speak clearly to the people, reaching their hearts and giving a voice to their concerns. The Duke becomes King George VI, and after working with Mr. Logue incessantly and even through a brief tiff, finally cements his relationship with Mr. Logue, leading to his first major speech as King. The resilient determination shown by King George VI motivates and encourages all to not be governed by fear, but to embrace the voice each individual has. This message is similar to the plight of Temple Grandin, where she perseveres in her struggle with autism.The lighting, camera techniques, and music amplify the feeling and depth of the intense emotions displayed by the characters. The lighting was natural and subdued, providing a somber and melancholy atmosphere. The lighting was dim and side lighting and low-key lighting was used to produce shadows, creating suspense and mystery, adding to the dark mood of the film. There were numerous close-up shots on the characters to augment their sentiments and responses, allowing the audience to be drawn in and directly involved in the character's experience. This indirect-subjective point of view was utilized numerous times throughout the movie, especially on King George VI as he showed his difficulty giving speeches, increasing the intensity of the struggles portrayed. Deep focus was also used to show the constraint and restriction incurred by the disability of the King. In the elevator scenes going to Mr. Logue's office, the camera showed a very closed in and tight atmosphere, emphasizing discomfort and entrapment. High-angle shots were also used to emphasize the despair and distress of the characters. The extremely high camera angle over Mr. Logue, as he walks down the long corridor of the church during the set-up for the King's coronation ceremony, effectively details his anxiety over the result of the conversation he sees taking place. Finally the music enlarged the already intense moments and emotions conveyed in the film, and generated even more power and passion in the film. The musical score communicated frustration, dismay, pain, and satisfaction, and worked alongside the emotions being shown on the screen. For instance, the symphonic music played drowning out the book reading of King George VI in Mr. Logue's office expressed frustration, mystery, curiosity and weariness. All of the elements contributed greatly to the visual impact of the film.The King's Speech is a fascinating story about desperation, vulnerability, and accomplishment. The film proves that individuals can prevail over disappointment and limitations of any kind, and any efforts made to stamp out our fears are well worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Good History Lesson,"This historical drama recounts the plight of King George VI, who must deal with his stammering problem after unexpectedly ascending to the throne. This doesn't sound like material that would translate into a winning film, but it turns out to be quite entertaining. Firth is fine as the King, a role that finally brought an Oscar to one of the most reliable British actors. Rush is equally good as the speech therapist whose unorthodox methods and uncouth manner infuriate the king. Ironically, when the king delivers his big speech to rally his country against the Germans, the music that is playing on the soundtrack is the Seventh Symphony of Beethoven, the great German composer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Told in a simple yet charming manner,"Colin Firth is a fantastic actor that has delivered great performances over the years but his portrayal of King George VI may be his best.The King's Speech is about King George VI as he ascends to the throne and is aided by speech therapist Lionel Logue to overcome his stammer.With a story about British monarchs, The King's Speech does have that label of being an Oscar bait film. However, so many aspects of this film work so well together that it's hard to not to like it. Immediately, the best part of this film comes from Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush. Colin Firth may have given his best performance to date as King George VI. Firth truly embodies the role as this monarch. His stammer is completely believable without ever feeling overdone, he has all the mannerisms a monarch would have and brings out so much emotion and vulnerability to the character based on the struggles we see him go through whether it's to do with his speaking or his family. He wholeheartedly deserved the Oscar that year. Supporting Firth is the excellent Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue. The relationship Rush has with Firth was so heartwarming and fun to watch. The initial struggle Firth had opening up to Rush to the eventual bond they create was played out very well. Guy Pearce did a good job as the difficult brother and Helena Bonham Carter was also really good as the supportive wife of King George VI.The filmmaking to go with the fantastic performances was also outstanding. Filmed exquisitely with stunning visuals and angles, Tom Hooper's direction excels in every way. The costumes and production design mesh to create an accurate depiction of that time period. As much as the visuals are great, the screenplay by David Seidler shines in its own right. The dialogue along with the acting capture the personalities of each character beautifully. It's filled with moments of humour, sadness and optimism whilst remaining engaging for the viewer. I can see why this won Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars in 2011. What also stood out to me was Alexandre Desplat's score that compliments the scenery and adds to the emotion.The King's Speech is a simple film that is executed really well and is a sure crowdpleaser. Aside from its predictability and blatant Oscar bait nature, it's a film with exceptional performances, well developed characters and a charming story that'll leave you feeling happy, motivated and optimistic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"A rare movie that lives up to the hype.  Best picture, actor and director and very deserving of all of them.  I say A","Even Kings need help sometimes. This is the true story about King George VI (Firth) and his problems with dealing with a stutter. After many failed attempts with therapists his wife enlists Lionel Logue (Rush) to help him overcome it. After Hitler begins to rise, England looks to King George for support. The stuttering king works to overcome it in order to lead his country. Knowing that this movie won Best Picture at this years Oscars there is a certain expectation going in. This movie does not disappoint and is a very deserving winner of the award. Colin Firth (who won the Oscar for this movie) does an amazing job, and much like Christian Bale in ""The Fighter"", without Firth this would not be half as good. After all the talk and hype most movies disappoint when you finally watch them (especially when you are one of the last ones to see it). This is one of the few exceptions, it is as good or better then you have heard. For a movie about speech therapy it moves pretty quick and is very entertaining to watch. This is one not to be missed.

Bridging the class divide,"Tom Hooper is some kind of madman. Yes, we can look back with the knowledge of the existence of Cats, but the evidence was here for all of us to see. This is a film that ends up working despite a director instead of because of him. The script by David Seidler is an intricately researched and constructed screenplay that focuses on two characters from vastly different social classes and even countries finding commonality in the face of great challenges. It's a great little example of the triumph of the human spirit, well-acted by everyone involved (which Hooper has to get some credit for) while being...filmed like a Terry Gilliam fantasy.The Duke of York (Colin Firth) has a debilitating stutter that keeps him from doing the public duties of his office despite the chastising from his father King George V (Michael Gambon). With the support of his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), he sees a series of doctors who cannot help him until she finds Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) in an out of the way corner of London who promises that he can get her husband past his stammer. Logue's approaches are unconventional, choosing a certain level of psychiatry to address underlying issues which Bertie, the familial name the Duke uses at home which Logue insists on using, is not open to revealing his personal life to a commoner and Australian, so they focus on mechanics to get him through tough moments.This action is countered by the palace intrigue as the Duke's elder brother, David (Guy Pearce), future King Edward VIII, is having an affair with the already divorced and still married American Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), an arrangement that George V opposes as well as the entire government behind him. When George V dies, Edward becomes king, parties for a year, and will not let go of his affections for Wallis Simpson to the point he decides to abdicate the throne, ceding it to the Duke of York who becomes King George VI which also happens to coincide with the rise of Hitler in Germany and the fall of George V's cousins in Germany and Russia a generation before, meaning a perilous time not only for England with the threat of war but also the monarchy itself in the time of revolution.Now, all of this works because of the writing and the performances. The characters are precisely drawn both on the page by Seidler and on screen by the actors. The standout is Firth as George VI, recreated the high-class patois and extreme stutter, including clicks at the back of the throat, who is able to emote through it all, his many lows and the reserved highs. Rush as Logue is also quite good, playing things slightly more loosely as the commoner. Carter is also something of a delight as Elizabeth, especially how she uses her polite manners to get her out of too much close interaction with the lower classes, like her quick series of excuses to get out of dinner at the Logue house when Logue's wife, Myrtle (Jennifer Ehle), automatically invites them to share a meal.I don't think the script is quite perfect, though. George V goes from vigorous and assertive to diminutive and consumed by dementia from once scene to the next (there may be a deleted scene to allow for more of a transition). There's a late reveal that Logue has manufactured his credentials that gets introduced and resolved within minutes that feels out of place (I imagine it's in line with the actual history, but that doesn't necessarily mean it works dramatically). Outside of those niggling issues, this is a very fine script very well performed.It's just that...Hooper is morally opposed to symmetry and correct application of the rule of thirds in a frame, and it's across the entire film. If it were in just moments of high drama or anxiety, it would make sense. It is more pronounced in those moments (like the Duke in the bottom left of a frame with the rest being wallpaper when he's first in Logue's office space), but throughout the entire film, it's just that everything is off. He is the opposite of Wes Anderson where he refuses to find symmetry at all. This creates a film full of odd compositions where there is just this omnipresence of negative space for no discernable reason across every scene. It's so odd, especially when combined with his penchant for wide-angle lenses in closeup. Seriously, this feels like Terry Gilliam directed it, and I don't think Terry Gilliam would have directed a straight historical drama like this. It ends up feeling like a Gilliam parody in a historical drama genre. It's weird.So, the script is really strong, the performances are really strong, and the visual pastiche is chaotically insane. It does make me question if Hopper has any idea what he's doing from a visual standpoint in directing films, like he's chasing ideas without much concern for how it will look or how it will actually play. He's an odd duck, the exact kind of guy who thinks a live-action, big-budget, CGI heavy adaptation of Cats is a great idea.Still, the movie works really well despite him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
royal friendship,"The first thing that can be said about 'the king's speech' is the performance. C.Firth is amazing, performing very realistic a person with speech problems. In addition, the friendship that is built between the two main characters, the king and his doctor, is blending in nicely with the whole plot, keeping the audience's interest up. The historical facts are combined easily in the story, not too boring or tiring and, fortunately, not too confusing. However, apart from the above, the film does not give something to look forward to. It captures the atmosphere of the time and the way of life in the United Kingdom, but it is getting stuck on some points. Plus the doctor is not presented as he should be, giving more details about his life and hopes. All in all, an interesting film, but only for the ones that like this kind of films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
God Save the King's Speech!,"This is a really entertaining movie - a great story of triumph and an interesting glimpse at the common man interacting with royalty. I doubt the King and his speech therapist were on first-person terms with one another as we see in the movie. That said, the relationship between the speech therapist and the royal is interesting. How Lionel Logue and King George VI interact and address the distinction between their class standings makes for some interesting interplay. My favorite scene was when Logue's wife comes home and finds out unexpectedly that the new King is in her humble house. She is completely shocked but keeps her composure. The challenge that public speaking presents for King George VI (Colin Firth) is huge. He stutters badly and this proves a great liability as radio becomes a more influential medium. He is embarrassed and when he faces the prospect of having to address the world more as he will expect to be King, he is dreadfully scared. He has tried many methods of speech therapy, none with great success and then he encounters an Aussie in Donal Logue (Geoffrey Rush) are founded on the belief that stuttering originates ultimately from a lack of self-confidence. As a result of his belief in the ability of people of any standing to believe in themselves, he doesn't allow the King to assume airs while he is treating him. When the King protests, he stands up to him. Again, I wonder if this is strictly true, but regardless, I'm sure there was some breaking of decorum in the King's treatment and so the positing of them as being on an equal footing is tolerable.There is some fantastic acting in this movie. Firth plays a very popular and admirable monarch. The King seems an extremely honorable and decent person in contrast to his playboy brother Edward VIII (Guy Pearce) who famously abdicated the throne to be with his twice-divorced wife. Pearce captures the posh British accent perfectly and imbues Edward with a royal's obtuse combination of callousness, wildness, and hypersensitivity. Helena Bonham-Carter bears an eerie resemblance to the Queen Mother at that age and delivers a typically excellent performance. Michael Gambon is good as the father of two Kings, worried about his health and the future of the monarchy, and Derek Jacobi is great as a very prickly Archbishop of Canterbury, upset at the impudence of a commoner who wishes to use ""his"" cathedral in order that the King can rehearse his speech.The plot, focusing on the time period starting with his disastrous 1925 radio speech to the Commonwealth until his coronation in 1937, is well-framed. The direction is confident and light, and the acting enhances the power of the movie. This is a great, thoughtful drama for adults.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Royal Triumph of Storytelling and Performance,"""The King's Speech"" is an exceptional historical drama that seamlessly blends emotional depth, historical significance, and outstanding performances. Directed by Tom Hooper, this film tells the inspiring story of King George VI's struggle to overcome his stammer and find his voice during one of Britain's most turbulent times.At the heart of the film lies Colin Firth's mesmerizing portrayal of King George VI. Firth delivers a performance that is both vulnerable and commanding, capturing the internal battle of a man torn between his royal duty and his personal insecurities. His chemistry with Geoffrey Rush, who plays Lionel Logue, the unconventional speech therapist, is the film's lifeblood. Rush's sharp wit and unwavering confidence contrast beautifully with Firth's hesitant and reserved demeanor, creating a dynamic partnership that is as heartwarming as it is inspiring.The screenplay, penned by David Seidler, is masterfully crafted. It balances the weight of historical events with intimate moments of human connection, making the story accessible to a wide audience. The film also delves into themes of friendship, perseverance, and the heavy burden of leadership, leaving a lasting emotional impact.The cinematography is understated yet effective, often using close-ups to emphasize the King's isolation and struggles. Alexandre Desplat's haunting score further elevates the film, subtly underscoring the emotional gravity of each scene without overwhelming it.While some may find the pacing a bit slow, the deliberate rhythm allows the characters and relationships to develop naturally. By the time King George delivers his climactic speech, the audience is fully invested in his journey, making the moment profoundly moving.In conclusion, The King's Speech is a beautifully told and impeccably acted film that transcends its historical roots to deliver a universal message about overcoming adversity. It is a story of courage and friendship that will resonate with anyone who has ever faced their fears. A must-watch for fans of historical dramas and character-driven stories.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Great Movie!,"How does one make a movie out of a serious speech impediment? When one has the director chops of Tom Hopper, the writing skills of David Siedler and the brilliant acting of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush along with a star-studded supporting cast, that's how.This is a character driven story as the plot is slender. But it still keeps you on the edge of your seat even though the outcome is known. I remember my father talking about the awful speech impediment of George VI and wondering how he ever overcame it and was it a ghost speaker he had on those fiery war era radio broadcasts. Well, now we all know.The movie is captivating and subtle, full of tender moments and unexpected comedic jolts.The future king's character is captured perfectly by Colin Firth, a man full of self-doubt and psychologically damaged from an early age. His speech therapist uses extremely unconventional tools to assist him in overcoming his handicap.I will not lay down spoilers due to the delicacy of the plot. If I have any reservation it is in the open show of affection displayed by the king for his wife and daughters in front of others. Kissing the queen, lifting the daughters. To anyone who has read anything about George VI, this was not in his nature at all, he was a very private, shy person. but that is a tiny whinge in a review of a film that was so utterly splendid in execution and casting.The supporting cast includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi.

"Ggggood, bbbbut not great","This is a biopic of King George VI (Colin Firth) which focuses on the formation of his friendship with Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a speech therapist who taught him how to overcome a stammer, so that the King could deliver inspiring speeches to his British subjects, particularly during World War II. Logue succeeds where others have failed because he refuses to patronize the King simply because he is royal, and instead he provides the King not only with speech therapy but also much needed emotional counseling which allows the King to mature into a man, if not a monarch.The King is depicted as insecure and childish who apparently acquired these traits as well as his speech impediment during his childhood as a result of an overbearing father, mean nannies and having lived a sheltered, privileged life. His wife, Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) appears to be his polar opposite - a confident, somewhat haughty take-charge type of gal. However, this was distracting because the real Queen was nothing like this and the portrayal of such a mismatched couple leaves the audience wondering how the two could have related to one another on any level.With a timeless story line and a dream cast who delivered excellent performances, this was clearly a good movie, but worthy of the Best Picture? I don't think so. Although this is a buddy-flick, it has the characteristics of a trite love story where boy meets girl, then loses girl, and then gets the girl in the end. And the ending falls flat - the King manages to deliver a public speech without falling apart (hence the namesake, ""The King's Speech"")...the end, or more appropriately...ThThThThat's all folks.This movie probably won best picture because it is so relevant to Hollywood.

Together, the both of them journey as they work together in order for Bertie to improve on his speech and gain an unexpected and long-lasting friendship.I liked this movie because I could relate to Bertie and his problem. Though I don't have a stammer, I am quite terrified of talking in public, so I found that I could easily relate to Bertie's hazardous breathing, his hectic eyes roaming the crowds and his numerous pauses when talking. If I could relate to it, I'm sure there are many others who did the same. This movie really was an inspiration.Though not all facts were 100% accurate, it doesn't do anything to harm this movie's reputation. Plus, most details are less than noticeable, so it won't take away anything from the movie. Unless, of course, you're a historical buff who is particular when it comes to such things. But if you're like me, who has very little knowledge about the life of King George VI, you might enjoy this one as much as I did.Viewed on: May 6, 2011",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"Bravo, great directing and acting","When making a movie about a historical event,in order to make the film good the director facing a big challenges: Take what is interesting about the event add some personal interpretation' but don't carry away. in this film Tom Hooper did it well, very well! the movie is fluid and every since isn't just ""thrown"" to the air, every scene is well thought out and have a meaning and influence over the next scenes and the whole idea of the film. The costumes of the actors are looking very authentic, and also all the background. The acting is spectacular! Colin Firth is giving a great performance. But in my opinion Rush is the biggest performer in this film. it is clear that a nominee for the Oscar( best supporting ) will be made.

Great Film,"This film has taken a wonderful story from history and turned it into an inspiring movie. This film tells the story of King George VI (Colin Firth) and his stammering issue and how he comes to rely on a common man Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) to overcome his struggle. They come to meet by the persistence of King George VI's wife, Queen Elizabeth, (Helena Bonham Carter). The film takes place during the time leading up to the beginning of World War II when Great Britain needed a great leader to hold the country together. Even though you know from history that everything works out, the film keeps you interested in the outcome and keeps you hoping for King George VI success.This is a film of a human story, it shows the struggle of a man overcoming his speech impediment so he can become the leader his country needs him to be during a time of war. What I like about this film is that it shows the human side of the King. It tells the struggles of his child hood and lets you see the potential of his great leadership, even though he doubts his abilities because of his stammering problem. You empathize for him whenever he struggles with stammering during important moments. Colin Firth does a wonderful job playing King George VI and does and outstanding job portraying the Kings speech impediment. Watching the banter between King George VI and Lionel Logue was one of the most enjoyable parts of the film. Firth and Rush did a wonderful job making their characters believable and interesting.The lighting in the film helps set the seriousness of the film and helps give it the period correct look. The director uses humor to help lighten the mood when needed so the film stays interesting and helps make the characters likable. The director uses a lot of close up shots of King George VI's face when he struggles with stammering and it shows the pain and determination he is enduring to try and talk. Seeing the pain King George VI endures to overcome his fear, helps inspire the viewer to face their own fears and overcome them rather than be enslaved by them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Great film!,"There were a lot of elderly folks in the theatre when I saw The King's Speech. It occurred to me that some of them may have been alive when George VI gave the actual speech to the British Nation which had just declared war with Hitler.The King's Speech is a feel good movie, but a very adult one, and while it tells a good story, well scripted, absorbing and believable (except for an odd line or two), Tom Hooper's film is far more driven by character than by plot.You may need to see it to believe it but, Colin Firth has no obvious competition for the best actor awards which are coming his way. He is absorbed in the role of the stammering king who is timid, low in self-confidence, and frustrated but perfectly warm-hearted. The only time he doesn't stammer is oddly enough when he curses. This is something which his new speech therapist suggests he use as a practise tool in the one scene which earned the film an R rating. The King's Speech is arguably a proud moment for Geoffrey Rush as well. This is him at his best, and he and Firth together almost make the movie. Their exchange of dialogue is flawless.The King's Speech boasts an exceptional British cast, which includes Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce, all of whom help contribute to the picture with the smallest amount of screen time.The King's Speech says a mouthful, and it warms the heart without question. There is also no question is arguing that it is among the very best of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Easily fits into my top ten,"Public speaking is not an easy thing to do. But it is even harder when you have a stammer/stutter. The Duke of York (Bertie) has struggled with this all of his life and has been seeking help but has found none suitable for him. His wife finds a different kind of treatment given by a man named Lionel Logue that is described as ""unorthodox and controversial"". As Bertie begins seeing this ""doctor"", he notices an improvement. Initially, when I heard about this movie and all of the raving reviews, I was honestly afraid I would find it dreadfully uninteresting. But when I did see it, I was surprised at how amazing and interesting it really is. You can add mine to that long list of positive reviews. Colin Firth, whom I had previously seen in ""Disney's A Christmas Carol"", won an Academy Award for this role, and rightfully so. He is so compelling and believable that is is hard to imagine him not being in this role of the Duke. Also, Helena Bonham Carter, in a role noticeably different than her usual, pulls off Queen Elizabeth very well and fits into it much better than one might expect. And, of course, Geoffrey Rush is perfect as the untrained doctor. This beautiful achievement easily fits into my top ten films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
I was surprised,"I normally avoid certain types of British film (costume dramas and films with people with posh accents pretending to be ordinary) and given the build up with all the usual sorts arty film people liking it (who also bumped up the awful ""history boys"") I had my concerns.I went to see this as a filler, Boy - was I wrong. This is a truly great movie. I felt a lump in my throat by the end and was totally absorbed by its pace and story. George V speech to Bertie about monarchy was brilliant - Prince Charles take note. It had no saggy bits. It really captured inter-war London, the odd accents of the time and the class distinctions. The tone of the filming was excellent - the colours were reminiscent of paintings by the Camden group of artists. The now thankfully historic heavy fogs and smogs and the grime of the streets.I thought the acting was superb and HBC actually made the Queen mum seem real - a little more restrained about the present Queen. The King comes across as fine chap standing up to his advisers and overcoming his fears to lead the country in its most dangerous time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

I was never once bored, in fact I was completely entertained every second of the film. But the real reason I watched this film was, not because of the story, but for the acting. It shouldn't come as a surprise, but Collin Firth is truly astonishing. His performance is more than Oscar worthy, and deserves to be always remembered. In fact, it was not acting. Collin Firth became the character of George VI. Also Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter both did a marvelous job in the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
a beautiful film,"The true story of Albert, Duke of York (Colin Firth), who in 1936, after the abdication of his brother, suddenly finds himself on the English throne. Europe is preparing for war. The nation and the situation requires forceful and resolute monarch, who will unify the British people and raised the rebellion against the Nazi threat. A touching, historical drama atypically genuine and humane story about a king who stuttered, about the British nation on the eve of the war and the mass media who was looking for a leader and demanded speaker. The King's Speech is definitely a film that wants to please, but it does so sincerely and prudently to its charm simply does not make sense to resist. Warm, funny and deeply human story with nostalgic view on last days of British colonial grandeur. The viewer is thrown into one of the most critical moments of the 20th century, is a film for young and old, for those who love history and for those looking for more personal, intimate story, for those who live on the dead and swear to the Queen, and for hardcore antimonarhists",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
This film is immensely powerful.,"This film is immensely powerful. It has a spectacular and enthralling classical soundtrack which sways your emotions ceaselessly, adding a voice above those of the actors. The clarity and beauty of the voice acting, and the sensitivity of the miking allows the audience to hear every sound made, every little sound of tongue and tooth that lends a intensly real and intimate quality not found in other films. This was a stand-out for me. Geoffrey Rush's acting was subtle and brilliant. His character and lines were cleverly manipulated to throw him into the light as an endearing and challenging personality, who provokes thought on the audience's part as well as driving the narrative. Helen Bonham Carter, also, is surprisingly comical due to her dainty pleasures. But the real star is certainly Colin Firth. His acting is superb. His duty playing the role would have been an extremely difficult one, but he attacks the part with every morsel of attention needed. His facial acting and voice acting especially is so subtle and authentic, and this subtlety and authenticity is picked up by the sensitivity of the filming. The pace, the silence, the size and the scenery of this movie all contribute to the overall greatness of its ending. It is truly remarkable.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Superb historical story and film,"The King's Speech is an all around outstanding film. Excellent casting, incredible acting, a terrific story, and the real world actually hanging in the balance.Geoffrey Rush is terrific as Mr Logue, a gifted, driven speech pathologist who works to help people regain the ability to talk without stuttering. Bertie, aka the to-be King George VIth, is played by Colin Firth. It was impressive to see Helena Bonham Carter as Her Majesty because you've seen her play some wildly opposite characters in various films. These three actors are the core stars in this film, and they all give great performances.Bertie is filled with self doubt because of his inability to speak in public without stuttering. He tries every remedy, but nothing works. He had two brothers, one who died earlier in life, and the older brother who really does not want to be King. Events happen that lead to Bertie being pressed into duty. While he knows he can do it, he doubts he can do the speaking part of it.A friendship develops between Mr Logue and Bertie, as each tries to find the right balance of power between a commoner, and a royal King, while they try to be equals with a job to do and a nation at stake.The nation is at stake due to Hitler's assault on Europe. Bertie knows that the UK needs to stand up and be counted, but he continually fears his inability to speak makes him weak, especially compared to Hitler's loud, forceful, moving oratory style.The King's Speech elicits all your emotions - happy, sad, fearful, hopeful, scared, laughing - and isn't that why you go to the movies? See this movie - it's one of the greats. Enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Excellent movie that leaves you reflecting on your own battles,"A movie about great courage, facing up to one's biggest fear. A fear that may seem irrational and insignificant to others but is an insurmountable mountain to the individual. A debilitating and overpowering enemy that every instinct in your body commands you to avoid at all cost. King George VI again and again is thrust into a situation where he feels forced to do battle with this fear head on. Repeatedly he gives up only later to take up the gauntlet again and ultimately he overcomes; or at least finds a workable modus operandi with his deep rooted fear, that enables him to fulfill his full potential and be a guiding light to his people at a time of great need.A courageous tale, eminently well played by Colin Firth, where he manages to be at once wooden, withdrawn and distant; yet vulnerable, sympathetic and all together absolutely convincing in the role of the stammering King George VI. Helena Bonham Carter also plays well as a supportive and persistent wife, even if her occasional application of a cold facade towards her husband's brother's fiancée and Lionel Logue's wife come across as inconsistent with the otherwise warm character she portrays. Geoffrey Rush is brilliant as the therapist who knows when to command, also in difficult situations when the king is behaving obstinately, yet shows a depth of vulnerability, humility and vainness when the king gives him a cold shoulder or an aloof amateur theater director works hard at coming up with multiple unlikely justifications for not awarding a role to Lionel. A great movie that will leave you thinking about the trials and tribulations the poor king had to face. Perhaps you will draw parallels to your own life and the particular fears you are either avoiding or facing up to.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
British film making at its finest,"The King's speech is a heartwarming, inspirational and humorous tale that weaves between elements of serious drama and comedy with ease, thanks in large to excellent performances from the entire cast, with Colin Firth standing out as the stammering King George VI in one of his finest starring roles to date. Geoffrey rush is ever watchable as Lionel Logue, the speech therapist that comes to George's aid in anticipation of his potential to take the throne, and their often troubled relationship provides much of the humour as George's stubborn nature prevents pronunciation progress ( now I would like to see King George get his chops around that phrase), despite Logue's best efforts to conquer his stammer.Alongside the King and his speech therapist, Guy Pearce and Helena Bonham Carter are riveting to watch as his self-righteous younger brother and dedicated wife and although Timothy Spall has a limited amount of screen time, his humorous portrayal of Winston Churchill is an important presence, with his stoic nature and determination providing the King with some much needed confidence.As the king's speech is a character driven plot, it is imperative that we can empathise with the cast and Hooper has done an exceptional job at lightening the tone in key moments throughout the film - to ensure that we warm towards the king and his entourage - whilst still maintaining the importance of the fascinating historical events that unfold as the plot progresses. It is an impressive feat to bring so much drama and tension to a single moment in history and the build-up to the film's climax is perfectly paced as our faith in the king's ability to perform his speech begins to waiver, and at times it is easy to forget that this is a historical drama as the wit and audacity of certain characters appears very current without feeling out of place in 1930s Britain.Basing the premise of an entire film on a speech impediment was a brave move from director Tom Hooper and one that has paid off fantastically with the film receiving a total of seven Golden Globe Nominations as well as being a hot contender for a number of Oscars. Awards discussions aside, The King's Speech is a wonderful film that completely surprised me with its enormously enjoyable storyline and engaging insight into the impact that speech impediments can have on their hosts.This is arguably British film making at its finest with top-notch performances from a fantastic ensemble cast, brilliant direction from Tom Hooper, and a storyline that inspires and amuses in equal measures all adding up to make the King's Speech an unmissable film.If you like this you will enjoy these:Frost/Nixon, The Madness Of King George, Quiz Show, Quills",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

I found it so sad how it could have been prevented if not for the terrible events during his childhood. But all the methods that the final 'doctor' used were ground breaking for his time and his patience amazing. I know that this might have impacted me more than others due to my personal connection to his speech problem but i highly recommend it, even if to understand what someone with this problem goes through.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Seamlessly Layered Multi-Faceted Visual Experience,"Tom Hooper's extraordinarily self-possessed crowd-pleaser conveys by way of true cinematic form the account of a man duty-bound to speak to the world with a speech impediment. It must be excruciating enough for one who stutters to address another individual. To handle a radio microphone and know the British Empire is taking note must be a nightmare. At the time of the titular speech, a quarter of the world's people was in the Empire, and naturally they'd be listening, including Germany, with special interest.Britain was going to war with Germany. King George VI's spectators needed resolve, precision and tenacity, not hesitant trip-overs disrupted with angst-ridden silences. This was a man who never sought to be king. After the death of his father, the throne was to succeed to his brother Edward. But Edward relinquished the throne to marry the woman he loved, and the responsibility fell to Prince Albert, who had grappled with his voice since childhood.Hooper begins this thoroughly pleasurable film with an aesthetically top-notch point-of-view sequence of Albert, struggling to open the British Empire Exhibition in 1925. Before a packed stadium and a radio audience, he clutches in misery to make the words emerge correctly. His father, George V, has forever deemed ""Bertie"" a cut above his brother, though bewails the establishment of media, which entail a ruler to be seen and heard on broadcast events.The triumph of the film comes, as far as I'm concerned, centrally from invariably being with and inside the king. Sensitively, we devote a vast amount in the character, and that understanding is delicately pushed along by using remarkable visual compositions. Wide lenses are used very close to the actors' faces to exceedingly evoke their and our emotional response, camera movement and lighting makes it persuasive and keeps us betrothed to the fearful ruler. Not only do I honor the audacious framing choices that visually share Bertie's discomforted struggle speaking, but there is also exquisite regeneration of the look of early color stocks.At that 1925 speech, we see Bertie's wife, Elizabeth, her face beset with pity. As it grows apparent that Edward's fixation on Wallis Simpson is incorrigible, she realizes her Bertie may meet more public disgrace. He sees numerous speech therapists, one of whom tries the old marbles-in-the-mouth custom. Nothing works, and then she finds an unsuccessful Australian actor named Lionel Logue, who has set up a speech therapy practice.Logue doesn't realize initially who is referring to him. And one of the focuses of the film is Logue's way of behaving toward crowned heads. He proposes to Albert that they speak in unceremonious terms. Albert has been reared within the majestic vacuum of the monarchy and take offense at such conduct, not because he has an eminent view of himself but because, well, it just isn't proper. But Logue understands that if he is to become the king's counselor, he must first become his acquaintance.This handsomely produced film is abounding in period nuances and fastidious class differences. Director Tom Hooper makes fascinating choices with his locations and visuals. The movie is mainly shot in interiors, and most of those spaces are an impressively rendered composition overlapping the constricted with the expansive. That's extraordinary in historical dramas, which highlight scope and splendor and that. Here we have elongated passageways, a bottomless and tapered master control room for the BBC, rooms that appear markedly geometric.The film mainly interests the actors Colin Firth, reserved and polite, and Geoffrey Rush, generous and outgoing, in psychosomatic labor. Helena Bonham Carter, who can be hardhearted, is here alive with benevolence, discretion and affection for her husband. This is the woman who became the beloved Queen Mother of our time, living to a hundred. As the men have a scuffle of self-control and spirit, she attempts to iron the situation. And in the broader realm, Hitler finds supremacy, war nears, Mrs. Simpson devastates, and the feared day looms when Bertie, as George VI, will have to address the world and wage war.Hooper's handling of that loaded scene is virtuosic. Firth interjects his anxiety and keeps the obligatory, virtually British-patented fortitude in the face of adversity, while his personnel and family are frightened on his behalf as he strides toward a microphone as if were a gas chamber. It's the one scene in the film that must come off, and it does, and its poignant effect is astoundingly deep. Finally, what we have here is a first-class historical drama and a commanding intimate one. And two contraries who stay confidantes for the remainder of their lives.The R rating concerns Logue's use of expletives. It's absolutely incomprehensible. This is an outstanding film for children and teenagers whose parents will blindly follow that they should forbid their kids from seeing it and let them see RED and the Twilight saga instead.While I'm raving, I might as well add that I think it terribly sad to find criticism of Danny Cohen's cinematography on message boards on grounds that it doesn't follow basic rules of composition. It's not common to find a film that merges all aspects of the world it creates into such a seamlessly layered multi-faceted visual experience. Quite close to every film we see is either shot in wides for epic scope and majesty or from the small-scale voyeuristic perspective, and even on the rare occasion that a film does both, it's at any given moment doing either one or the other. By that token, one might go as far as to say that most films fail to capture half of the story they depict! That is, by the standards set by this transcendent picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Mesmerizing.,"A film about a man trying to overcome a speech impediment? Can't be too good, the subject matter isn't exactly riveting is it. Well, that's what I thought before seeing The King's Speech anyhow; before witnessing a performance by Colin Firth that must put him in good stead to finally win himself the illustrious Oscar for Best Actor; before seeing Geoffrey Rush at his absolute best; and before scribe David Siedler and director Tom Hooper demonstrated that a film about a man trying to overcome a speech impediment can be bloody riveting.Hooper is a very British director; not in the sense of where he was born, rather that he has excelled working on projects that concentrate on the majestic and regal way of life and that exclusively deal with archetypical high class British characters. He's obviously keen on period pieces – his ""John Adams"" and ""Elizabeth I"" miniseries attest to this – and he's now developed that avidness and prior experience into something very special indeed. Dramatic period pieces are often renounced as ostentatious, overly-flamboyant pictures that feature pompous, plum-mouthed characters hard to care for. When done right – hello, Elizabeth and The Young Victoria – they're anything but; they're enthralling, exciting and transcend the multi-generational gap. Hooper has achieved this with near perfection, for his recount of the Prince's battle with a stammer is unequivocally gripping from start to finish without even a hint of pretension.At its heart The Kings Speech is a buddy flick in its finest form. The relationship between Lionel and Bertie – as the quirky Australian would call him, much to Prince Albert's dismay – is funny, sad, touching and engaging, with their friendship blossoming in a natural and compelling way. They complement each other akin to Matthau and Lemmon did in The Odd Couple; Albert uptight and apprehensive thanks to his secluded life within castle walls where the butlers and nannies counted as friends, Lionel carefree and slightly off-kilter due to his acting background. However Lionel's abrasiveness – and more specifically his determination to treat Bertie like a common person – was exactly what Albert required, and quite probably, yearned for.It goes without saying that the standard of acting on show is second to none. Firth has garnered critical acclaim that has many thinking he is a shoo-in for the Academy Award, and honestly, he should be. He embodies the insecure Albert with the ideal balance of strength and vulnerability, making him relatable and likable despite his many human flaws. Rush on the other hand is an affecting delight as the idiosyncratic and often facetious Logue, investing him with such depth and charisma that should see him also nab an Oscar nom. Somewhat against type as Queen Elizabeth, Bonham Carter is marvellous as the sturdy and even-tempered constant in Albert's life, prompting thoughts that perhaps she should stray from husband Tim Burton a little more often in her career.The King's Speech is sumptuously photographed, powerfully acted, captivatingly scripted and brilliantly directed. Simply put: it's mesmerizing.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

A Regal Affair,"This is truly an elegant and scrumptious movie! Everything about it feels lavish and luxurious. From the direction, production, acting and everything else! It might seem a bit as a by-the-numbers film, but believe me, it more than makes up with its high pedigree. Colin Firth is really great in his performance and completely deserved the Oscar he so rightfully won. But it is not just him, because he is anchored by a stunning and wonderful supporting cast, from Helena Bonham Carter (who should have also won a Supporting Actress Oscar) to the amazing Jeffrey Rush, Derek Jakobi, Michael Gambon, Guy Pearce and Jennifer Ehle.While I was rooting for David Fincher to win the Oscar for Best Director, I am not sorry that Tom Hooper received it, because he deserved it just as much. Tom Hooper has been a favourite of mine for many years now. He might be best known to North American audiences for his spectacular work for HBO, with the multiple-award winning mini-series ""Elizabeth I"" and ""John Adams"" as well as TV movies such as ""Longford"" and the small movie gem that was ""The Damned United"" with Michael Sheen.The same goes for Best Movie Of The Year. I still think that ""The Social Network"" should have won, but ""The King's Speech"" is a worthy choice also.Beyond all the quirky episodes and soaring moments of the movie, this is at its hear a story about friendship, trust, loyalty and what those ingredients add up to in someone's life, not matter his/her station and/or position in society.If you haven't already done so, do yourself a favour and go see this wonderful movie.

The Art of Creating Empathy,"The King's Speech is a controversial movie, no doubt in that. Most of the arguments against this movie focus on one thing: ""This was not how it actually happened."" The only answer I give to this argument is: ""Because it is not a documentary."" The King's Speech, chose to increase the effect of its message by leaving some facts and side parts out. The movie is about two characters, which are both portrayed fabulously, rather than UK- King George VI relation. This movie clearly and cleverly demonstrate what it is trying to accomplish but most importantly, it made me empathize with a king. No, the king wasn't portrayed as someone from the common people, not at all; but yet I empathized with him. This just shows the talent in front of and also behind the camera.

"Surprisingly very, very good","There has been so much already said or suggested about this artsy film that my additional opinion is hardly needed or warranted, and I'm hardly a fan of politics or the royal family, so why am I even here? Boredom, word of mouth, high ratings... the usual sort of Oscar-nominated stuff; I had some time and I just went with it, eventually... but I'm so glad I took the jump into what looks like a nodding borefest on the surface, which is anything but!Such a lovely film for a multitude of reasons, but most of all because of Colin Firth's acting. He was astonishing, and I commented to this effect three times throughout the film. I had no real opinion beforehand, other than it must be overrated and one of the yearly artsy nominations for the sake of good acting, cinematography and mostly boring attributes that most people don't care about, as well as being obviously pompous, old fashioned and rather pedestrian, until I witnessed Firth's amazing portrayal. It wasn't so much his ability to feign stuttering, but the emotion in the man's eyes. The way he portrayed absolute dignity, humility and genuine fear. The rest of the cast was also superb, but Firth has jumped several ranks in my esteem.I also liked the inclusion of Edward and Mrs. Simpson, and all the palaver surrounding the champagne-swilling, frivolous lifestyle in comparison to the realities of WWII, and the King's ability to lead his people by example.

His wife hires an Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue in order to help him. The movie tells us a story about friendship between the King and Lionel and historical events of that time. It was really pleasant to see it. Colin Firth was amazing as King George - you can really see how great actor he is. Really worth see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The best film of the year.,"Rarely do films reach the heights that this film has striven, and thoroughly succeeded, at doing. As much as movies today have been crowded out with moronic films of dubious character and even lower concept, this one moved me on a level I haven't felt in years. With tremendous writing, an inspired, superior cast, and a level of subtly that never fails to impress, I can't even recall a story of such humanity and substance. When so many films today have replaced good acting and great scripts with special effects, violence, and gratuitous sex, it's good to know that occasionally Hollywood steps up to the plate and hits a home run. With this modern masterpiece, it takes a well deserved bow.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

I love this Movie,"I just watched this movie for the third time today. I love everything about this film. The acting by Colin Firth, Helena Bonham Carter, and Geoffry Rush is superb. It's also funny how they included 3 actors from BBCs pride and prejudice. Mr Darcy, Elizabeth Bennet, and Mr. Collins. The speech at the end is so inspiring, and Colin Firths acting performance may be the one of the best ever put to film. Though some say the social network or inception should have won best picture but I disagree. The Kings Speech is masterfully done and it's too bad that it doesn't get as much praise as it deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Worthy of the Oscar,"The King's Speech was a worthy Oscar winner, one of the best films I watched in the year. It is very well executed with good to excellent performances from everyone involved in the film. The cinematography is also very good and the soundtrack features the second movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony, one of the best pieces of classical music.The plot revolves around the personal problems of the king of England in dealing with his speech impediments and the social bonds he formed with the people involved (the speech doctor and his family, mostly).Overall, it is not a masterpiece, but it is not a simple forgettable film either.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
This Was Very Meaningful...,"I watched this movie a long time ago, with my parents, when I was still smaller. But I didn't understand the concept at first, because I had a small, innocent mind. Then, I watched it previously, and it warmed my heart. It was a simple movie, some people say bland, but I say brilliant. Reality isn't always so sweet, full of great photography and cinematography, the photography to me, was very marvelous for this kind of theme, more of a black and white concept. I liked this movie. It was very touching, showing how hard people can work. I recommend this movie to people who have not watched it, because it's a very heartwarming and meaningful movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"A Brilliant Film, A Brilliant Speech!","""The King's Speech"" was superb! After all of the praise this film had been given, I had high expectations which were incredibly exceeded. It was well written with a fantastic choice of cast. It was refreshing watching a film in the 21st century that was so brilliant, yet did not need special effects or over dramatic scenes to capture its audience. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end, scared to tear myself away from the film at any moment, in fear that I would miss a minute of it. The scenes and settings were very believable of the historical time that it portrays. If you don't watch this masterpiece, you truly will be missing out on an impeccable mark in the history of film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
20th century English period drama. King George VI takes the throne with an impeding stammer.,"One of the many holiday movies I enjoyed seeing was The King's Speech. Colin Firth plays England's King George VI, troubled by a stammer that impeded his speech since childhood. Geoffrey Rush plays an equally compelling character as Lionel, his speech therapist. It was a perfect movie to see with my dad as it deftly interlaced a feel-good story with a lot of pertinent English history.Firth's impressive acquired speech impediment, his stammer, is believably portrayed throughout the film, and he gives the audience many a memorable outburst in Lionel's (his speech therapist) office. As an American teenager studying British history, I did not learn much about King George VI's stammer, but the movie presents an interesting historical perspective on not only the possible ramifications of England's response to Hitler at the outset of World War II, but the wider-ranging effects an ineffectual king could have had on the nation.Firth and Rush's performances definitely highlight the movie that emphasizes lesser-known historical aspects of the royal family. As nuanced as Firth's performance is of the struggling king, Rush matches that prowess as a hilarious and eccentric Australian who refuses to conform to the rules of everyone else.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Most excellent!,"I always like a film based on true events, it seems that real life has just as many amazing stories as pure fiction. This is a case in point. A man who stammers has to rise above his affliction, with the help and support of those around him, to speak for a nation. It's quite a remarkable film. Here's a short summary first before I give you my thoughts (summary haters please wait outside while I get through the next speech sorry, paragraph).King George VI, known as Bertie to his friends and family, was not born to be king. That honour went to his older brother David, or King Edward VIII, after their father George V passed away. Unfortunately, David finds he cannot carry out his duties due to events in his private life (quite a scandal actually) and so Bertie has to step in. A long time before this he had started seeing an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue. He had always stammered and found it particularly hard to speak in public. With the help and support of Logue, his wife, Elizabeth and his daughters another Elizabeth (later to become Queen Elizabeth II) and Margaret; this film depicts how he overcame his problems to give a very important speech live on the radio to the entire British Empire (as it was then) just after the outbreak of World War II. It also gives an insight into the reasons for Edward's abdication and the effect it has on the nation. But I think that's enough summary for now.I found this a totally engaging film from start to finish. As a Brit, I was taught about the abdication of Edward VII in school, but I never knew about George VI's stammer or the work of Lionel Logue. Of course, the film is most noted for the performance of Colin Firth as King George VI (Bertie to his friends), which is totally justified, he is outstanding! Also worthy of note are both Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue and Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth. Honourable mentions go to Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, Michael Gambon as King George V, Guy Pearce as King Edward VIII, Claire Bloom as Queen Mary and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill.Apart from the performances, I thought it was an excellent screenplay by David Seidler. Nicely directed by Tom Hooper, it depicts the period perfectly. This is a film with many laughs, more than a lot of modern 'comedies', IMO, which serve to lift the mood of what is, after all, rather serious events in world history. Over all, brilliant performances, a great story and a few laughs along the way who could ask for more? Very highly recommended.My score: 9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

A Decent Movie,"Unbelievably boring due to my lack of interest in monarchy system, but I can put that aside.The actors are awesome, the sceneries are remarkably well-chosen. As an audience, I can feel this movie was really taken in 1910 or thereabouts. Forgive me for the date inaccuracy, I don't really care about monarchy history. It's slightly close, isn't it?And realizing that the royal family are actually human being as well from this movie is the greatest appreciation of mine.

A remarkable work !,"The King's Speech is one of my favourite films because it is both funny and sensitive. It is not a film just about royalty. This film is more a human story played by excellent actors at the peak of their craft. In the opening scene we can see how it will be difficult for GeorgeVI, the new king, after EdwardVIII abdicated and renounced the throne. Is it possible to take on the responsibility of royal duties with a speech impediment ? The new king has proved it with courage and, above all, with a great wife and an excellent therapist. The film shows his effort, his courage. There is no special effect, no action but it is exciting. When you watch the film, you are in London with the king telling: ""you can do it"". Moreover, the film is a visual experience with foggy streets. I do not know a lot of this period of British history but I think it is faithful to reality. Finally, I intend to watch it again as I loved it. The film director has done a fantastic job !",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Captivating film with great performances,"Firth seizes you from the first shot itself and his performance is the driving force that makes this a captivating watch.

The King's Speech,"The King's Speech takes place in late 1930's Britain and focuses on the monarchy of the royal family at the time. The current king is King George the 5th and when he passes on, the role of the king will go to one of his sons, either George, or his brother Edward. The film focuses on George though as he is married and has two daughters and in a lot of ways would like to become the next king of England, except his one struggle is the way he speaks. Since he was a young boy he developed a stammer and can not pronounce or talk at the same speed, or pronounce it the same as everybody else. With the current invention of radio becoming a big hit, George knows that he must learn to lose his stammer and so he is introduced to a speech therapist named Lionel Logue. George has seen different speech therapists before, so is very sceptical and unoptimistic that anything will be different with Lionel, but to his surprise, under Lionel's direction, he is getting better. Lionel who has a very unorthodox and unusual ways of doing things, connects with George, not only as his speech therapist, but as a good friend as well. This tale based on a true story is about their friendship and how in more ways than one, they are able to help each other out in life and as friends. Next to Mao's Last Dancer, I found The King's Speech to be the most uplifting and inspiring film of 2010. I think what makes it that way to me, is the fact that these two men, who in many ways are total opposites and how they are able to both reach each other and help each other out in life and how lasting and important their friendship is to each other and the beautiful and helpful times they will have together. The other inspirational part is about George and his stammer and how he is continually helped by Lionel to overcome it. We also see Lionel, working also as a friend to coach George, on the pressures of being in the limelight and in the royal monarchy and basically life itself. Along with Mao's Last Dancer, this is the type of film that warms your heart and makes you want to stand up and cheer after you have seen it. My favourite parts of the film were George and Lionel interacting with one another because in those scenes there is so much heart, human emotion and at times some very funny moments as well. The film's screenplay draws us back to the 1930's and instead of being a stuffy, or boring film, I instead found it to be so full of life and humour and so inspirational about who we can become as people and how the ones who are dear to us, can really help us out in the end and that friendships are a wonderful thing. The history aspects of this film were fascinating to me as well and of course the main point of George getting, or trying to lose his stammer was fascinating to watch because of the great character build ups and the way these characters interact with one another. It is a fantastically written film and the writing comes through with very good direction and of course excellent acting. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are terrific here as George and Lionel and they give so much human qualities to these characters that in any well done film such as this, you get to care for them and have your own sense of respect for them and just watching them is a complete and total joy. Colin Firth will win the Oscar for his portrayal of George at the Oscars in a few weeks and it is a well deserved win. The film with it's period piece settings are very suitable and enhance the historical aspects of the film and all the supporting actors do a great job here as well. To me though the thing that stayed with me and touched my heart was the message that with help from others be it friends, spirituality, or the ones closest to us, we can get help with the burdens, or things we have been struggling with and that every one of us does have one true great friend who can inspire us to go on and do great things and we can be at the side of that friend and go on to inspire them to greatness as well, no matter what field, age or any situation you are in. The King's Speech is a very entertaining film and works because of it's great direction, script and acting as well as the core messages of the film that will inspire us and warm our hearts. This is one of the best films of 2010.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Bertie and Lional make a great team,"This movie deals humorously and honestly with the personal struggle of a man who takes over as King at a critical time in British history and goes on to rule the country during the second great war of the twentieth century. The King is George VI and his struggle is against his own inadequacy which results in a serious speech impediment, a stutter - a rather awkward defect in a member of the Royal Family, even more so as it becomes apparent that he will become the new monarch. It is hard to imagine anyone performing the role of monarch under such a condition; however, with the help of a dedicated and tough speech therapist, Lional Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush, George VI, played by Colin Firth, is able to carry out his role and in fact, perform it superbly. The interaction between the two main characters is what gives this movie its dramatic impact. These two unlikely human beings are brought together by a challenge that will test them and summon up their utmost strength of purpose in pursuit of their goal, which is to give the King his voice and to lead his subjects at a time of a great national crisis. The dialogue is funny, witty, and often confrontational but through it all, a great friendship is created. The King is ably supported by his wife, the Duchess of York and later the Queen, performed by Helena Bonham Carter. She conveys the combination of regal bearing and common touch that made her character so popular with the British people. Michael Gambon is excellent as George V. Claire Bloom's talent is generally wasted in the role of Queen Mary. Her role gave her character no scope, unusual for the woman who was at the heart of the family. She is made up in way that she neither looks like herself or Queen Mary. Both David (Guy Pearce), who becomes Edward VIII, and the object of his devotion, Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), are portrayed as the fun-loving but irresponsible couple that history has come to view them. Derek Jacobi excels as the Archbishop of Canterbury, Cosmo Lang. Anthony Andrews has a small but effective role as Stanley Baldwin, the prime minister. All in all, a fine movie with a great story of how the second son stepped up and became a great national symbol when history commanded him.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"THE KING'S SPEECH (Tom Hooper, 2010) ***1/2","Though I have had it for some time, I decided to watch this the day after its Oscar triumph – since I had an inkling THE SOCIAL NETWORK (2010) was not going to make it (I was still surprised that the director of that one, David Fincher, lost out to a newcomer). Like most viewers, I am wary of a British costumer (though the period in this case was not too far removed from the present) but, since this came in the form of a history lesson (apart from the nominal human drama), the result proved more palatable than usual. That said, Hooper's directorial style here seems to rely a lot on unusual angles (even if these were not really necessitated by this type of genteel fare).The major contributing factors to the film's success are a witty script (by 73 year-old David Seidler, who also emerged a winner at this year's Oscars) and, of course, the ensemble acting from a variety of thespians. Colin Firth is the stuttering King George VI – the virtually 'uncontested' recipient of the Best Actor Oscar (in a role typically favored by the Academy). Nominee Helena Bonham-Carter appears as Firth's understanding but feisty wife, ditto Geoffrey Rush his iconoclastic speech therapist (he and Firth, incidentally, had already appeared together in another Best Picture upset i.e. Shakespeare IN LOVE [1998]) – in a way, his role here recalls his own Oscar-winning turn as a schizophrenic pianist in SHINE (1996), while his Executive Producer credit guaranteed the film end incongruously on a close-up of himself! In support are Guy Pearce as the somewhat immature King Edward VIII (who was forced to abdicate the throne because of his illicit affair with an American divorcée'), Derek Jacobi as the pompous Archbishop Of Canterbury, Michael Gambon as the confrontational King George V, Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill, Anthony Andrews as Former PM Stanley Baldwin (who also tendered his resignation in view of a tolerant attitude shown towards Hitler's European offensive), and Claire Bloom as the Queen during Gambon's rule – oddly enough, I failed to recognize the last two mentioned!The premise is simple enough: Firth's speech impediment threatens his role as the country's regal voice (brought to the fore with the advent of radio and, though only the Duke Of York, he was forced to assume this responsibility due to Gambon's final illness and Pearce's controversial private life). Though he had tried every manner of quack doctor, his wife is adamant that he overcome this problem – eventually, he goes to an Australian who thinks nothing of his patient's rank, treating him as an equal and calling him with the diminutive Bertie. For this reason, the two start off on the wrong foot but then settle down to business – via vocal coaching, incorporating tongue-twisting phrase and swearing(!), and physical exercise – only to clash again over what appears to be Rush's meddling with affairs of State, before the ultimate 'miracle' is performed. In fact, the King gets through his all-important address to the nation when war breaks out virtually without a hiccup, pardon the pun. The best scenes are the afore-mentioned dissolution of the 'partnership' set in a park, the Coronation rehearsal which also involves the scheming Jacobi's revelation that Rush has no medical qualifications (he is a ""failed actor"" who learned his 'craft' assisting shell-shocked soldiers during WWI!), and the predictably stirring finale – both in view of the sentiments in the statement being read and, of course, Firth's personal accomplishment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Splendid Masterpiece,"(Synopsis) ""The King's Speech"" is the story of the speech impediment that King George VI (Colin Firth), the father of the present day Queen Elizabeth II, struggled with his entire life. George dreaded any form of public speaking, and because he was second in line to the throne, he did not have to worry about becoming King. However, when his brother abdicates, he must assume the throne and begin giving speeches on the radio. George has engaged the help of an Australian speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Logue doesn't have a medical degree, but he has worked in the theater and with shell-shocked soldiers after World War I. Using unorthodox techniques and hard work, George learns to speak through his stammering to deliver a flawless speech heard by millions of people around the world.(My Comment) Everyone knows someone who has had a stammering problem, and how we try to help them when they struggle to get their words out. We feel their pain, and that is why this is one of those stories that we want to end well. Since the movie is based on a true story, we know it did, and we can root for the little guy who became a hero and his friend. Geoffrey Rush's amazing and outstanding performance as the speech therapist was brilliant. Colin Firth's astounding performance as the stuttering King George VI was just right and wonderful.

"""This movie is worth seeing, if anything, for the performances.""","The King's Speech is about a man who can't complete a sentence without stuttering or stammering. To make matters worse, he is to become the next king, which means he is required to publicly give long and eloquent speeches. The man, George, eventually ends up hiring an unorthodox speech therapist, Lionel, to cure his problem.George is played by Colin Firth, who gives an amazing performance. You don't need three guesses to guess who I think should win the ""Best Actor"" Oscar. George's speech therapist is played by Captain Barbossa himself, Geoffrey Rush. If Firth deserves ""Best Actor"" then Rush deserves ""Best Supporting Actor"". These guys can act and they show it here. This movie is at its best when Firth and Rush are on screen together; their speech therapy sessions are the highlights of the movie. This movie is worth seeing, if anything, for the performances. I should mention Helena Bonham Carter, who is also very good here. It's surprising and refreshing to see her in a nice quiet role; something that isn't weird, zany and/or Tim Burton-related (not that there's anything wrong with that).That being said, I do have a few qualms with the movie. I wish that the father-son relationship (with Michael Gambon) was a bit more fleshed out, and that the whole storyline with the brother (Guy Pearce) had been either refined much better or somehow completely removed. I wanted more emotional impact with the father and couldn't have cared less about the brother.The King's Speech is also slightly hindered by its mostly basic and predictable plot. It's one of those things where you know where the movie is going but are still interested enough to see how it unfolds. Some parts of the movie, specifically when Rush is absent for a while, seem to stretch and it would have served the movie well to have been shortened by about 20 minutes. In spite of this, it's very satisfying and inspirational when the movie finally reaches its conclusion.On a side note: It's interesting to see this movie Rated R strictly because of language, especially when a movie like True Grit is Rated PG-13 when it has people getting shot and murdered.

The Reluctant King And The Speech Therapist,"History has long served as an inspiration for filmmakers. This is especially true of story's from the past that serve to inspire. Director Tom Hooper's new film The King's Speech, with its tale of a reluctant king trying to over come a speech impediment with the help of an unorthodox speech therapist, is a perfect example of just such a tale. It is more then just an inspiring story though in that it is also a fine example of the art of film-making.There's the performances of the two lead actors, Colin Firth as George VI and Geoffrey Rush as his speech therapist Lionel Logue respectively, for example. Firth brings King George VI, known as ""Bertie"" by those closest to him, to life as a man who has struggled all his life to overcome his stutter only be to thrust into a role he hoped he'd never have to take. The role is a perfect place for Firth to show off his range from the almost comedic exercises to overcome the stutter to his occasional bad temper. Firth's best moments in the film comes in the scene where he talks to Logue about his childhood in a scene that is so heartbreaking that it threatens to reduce a viewer to tears and in the climatic speech as Britain enters the Second World War. Rush plays Logue as a man of seemingly infinite faith in his patient and who must overcome the skepticism of all those around to help George VI. Like Firth, the film gives Rush a chance to show off much of his range in the process. Watching the film, it is not hard to see why both have received well deserved Oscar nominations.Both Firth and Rush are backed by a fine supporting cast. Leading it is Helena Bonham Carter, herself receiving a much deserved Oscar nomination as George VI's wife Elizabeth who becomes his greatest supporter not only once he becomes King but in his battle to overcome the stutter. Guy Pearce plays George VI's charismatic and much loved older brother Edward VIII who eventually abdicates the throne for American divorcée Wallis Simpson (played by Eve Best). Much of the supporting cast is made of up of actors and actresses who makes the most out of otherwise small roles. These include Derek Jacobi as Archbishop Cosmo Lang, Michael Gambon as King George V, Claire Bloom as Queen Mary, Jennifer Ehle as Logue's wife Myrtle, the aforementioned Eve Best and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. Overall the supporting cast of The King's Speech does what any fine supporting cast does: support the lead actors and stand out in their own right.The film's production values are just as fine as its cast. Director Tom Hooper has made something of a career in expertly bring the past to life and this film is no exception. The production design Eve Stewart brilliantly recreates the numerous 1920s and 1930s settings of the film to the point I suspect that only an expert would know the difference between real locations and film sets. Much the same can be said of the costume design work of Jenny Beavan which helps to believably bring the character's to life with the actor's help. The cinematography by Danny Cohen, while perhaps a bit too dark in places, serves the film well. In particular there are moments when the cinematography, combined with the editing of Tariq Anwar and Hooper's direction, even gives the viewer a sense of what George VI's nervousness must have felt like when trying to publicly speak with his stutter. The result is a film that is as visual engrossing as the performances within it.Last but not least is the script by David Seidler. Seidler's script takes a little known story about a member of the British royal family and turns it into a drama that is both engrossing and inspiring. Seidler also sprinkles the drama with little touches of humor throughout that helps to illuminate the fact that these figures from the past were all also flesh and blood human beings. That said the film (and by extension its script) is not 100% historically accurate, though it doesn't claim to be. In particular, the film's treatment of Edward VIII and his abdication are a bit off. This is especially true of a scene with Edward being perhaps a bit too antagonistic towards his brother and where the future Queen Elizabeth mentions a rumor of Wallis Simpson having learned ""skills"" while in Shanghai (a rumor that has long since been proved untrue). The film also seems to give the impression that Churchill strongly supported the abdication (where as in in real life he seems to have done everything in his power to avoid it). One charge leveled at the film I disagree with is how it supposedly glances over Edward VIII's apparent Nazi sympathizing which certainly does not seem to be the case upon watching the film. For the most part though the film stays true to known history and is at its best doing so.From the fine performances of Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush to the fine supporting cast apparent throughout, to the as equally splendid production values and the script by David Seidler, The King's Speech presents an engrossing and inspirational true story. It is a tale of a reluctant king trying to overcome a speech impediment that threatened to ruin him and the man whose unorthodox methods helped him on the path to doing so. It is also a fine example of film-making, and the ability of film-makers to bring the past back to life, as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A wonderful film which is definitely Oscar-winning!,"The King's Speech was not essentially aimed at people my age & I was quite surprised that I thoroughly enjoyed the film throughout!The movie is about George VI who is required to speak publicly to the UK & to most of the world. However, he has a stammer.The King's Speech shows you the journey of how the Duke of York went through many methods to try to overcome his speech difficulties.Firstly, the acting was fantastic! Colin Firth fits perfectly for the role of King George VI & Geoffrey Rush was perfect for Lionel Louge! The rest were great in their roles but Timothy Spall didn't fit the part of Winston Churchill.The whole film kept me on the edge of my seat and there were quite a few moments which made the audience giggle!

An impeccable roller-coaster of emotions,"An incredible movie to say the least. Describing this movie as a doctor helping a king with his stuttering would be misleading. This is so much more. The framing is something out of the ordinary. Very often will you see a scene where the person on one side of the frame while the other half is a plain wall. Same goes with music. It perfectly and very subtly dictates what emotions we shall feel. It ties perfectly with the scenes where the king is under pressure. The build up and escalation is presented incredibly. One would think it's unrepeatable yet it's done so many times in this movie I can't be ever bothered to count.TL;DR: Every emotion you can think of you will, directly or indirectly, feel. Friendship, sadness, love, contempt, anger, jealousy, regret, impatience, hopelessness and the list goes on. Best movie I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
An historical drama,"The story opens with England's King George V concerned that none of his three sons- David, Albert or John, might develop into genuine kingly material worthy to succeed him. John is already out of the picture, having prematurely died at age thirteen without ever making a single public appearance. David, the Prince of Wales, enjoys all the necessary physical appearance and surface manners to make him at least visually and aurally suitable for Royal public diplomatic life as the future King, yet seems in many ways unworthy of the throne. His mother, Queen Mary, agrees with the King on this point, as do the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Prime Minister. Albert, the Prince of York, enjoys at least the appropriate moral fortitude and sense of honor and duty to nation and church, and also as leads an upstanding Royal life as his claim to the throne. Albert,nevertheless, stammers in public and is considered by his wife, Duchess Elizabeth, to be an introverted stammerer unprepared to live a public life in a fishbowl. By the time David has ascended the throne as King Edward VIII, Duchess Elzabeth has already sought an unorthodox route toward socializing Albert by taking him in secret to an unlicensed speech therapist in Harley Street who might or might not be able to make him more at ease during radio speeches and public appearances. The mew monarch's clash with the Prime Minister because of his affair with a courtesan closely associated with the Nazis, as well as his clash with the Archbiship of Canterbury because he wishes to take as his Queen an American divorcée with two living husbands, raises the possibility that Albert might soon ascend the throne as King George VI. Can his wife and therapist mutually guide Albert to become more at home during public appearances?",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"The ratings board was established to help protect young film viewers, not punish them!","'THE KING'S SPEECH': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)One of the most critically acclaimed movies of the year and Oscar front-runner (trailing only 'THE SOCIAL NETWORK' in top honor predictions) is this highly enjoyable, educational and inspirational film. It's directed by Tom Hooper (who also directed the critically acclaimed and award winning historical mini-series 'JOHN ADAMS' as well as the film 'THE DAMNED UNITED') and written by David Seidler (who's other writing credits include several TV movies and animated films as well as the 1998 Francis For Coppola / Jeff Bridges film 'TUCKER: THE MAN AND HIS DREAM'). It has an impressive cast including nice turns from Geoffrey Rush, Guy Pearce and Helena Bonham Carter. Most impressive though is leading man Colin Firth (who is expected to take home the best actor Oscar) who gives a great emotional and inspiring performance.The film tells the story of how Albert the Duke of York (Firth), Bertie to his family and friends, overcame his speech troubles and became King George VI. It begins in 1925 at a time when radio is becoming ever more prominent and requiring ""monarchs to become skilled actors"" as Bertie's father King George V (Michael Gambon) tells him. After performing an embarrassing stammering speech at the Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium Bertie's wife (Carter) finds him a unique speech specialist by the name of Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Through several years of frustrating training the two form a strong friendship and Bertie eventually learns to overcome his problem (to a certain extent), which becomes a necessity after his father dies and his older brother King Edward VIII (Pearce) neglects his responsibilities and hands over the thrown.The movie is heartfelt and extremely emotional, a truly inspiring film about overcoming one's fears and insecurities. It's also a great story about love and friendship as well as being a well made and entertaining history lesson. Which is a shame considering the movie's R rating, which will keep a lot of younger viewers from seeing it. The film is about as tame and innocent as most PG or even G rated films but it does contain 17 uses of the F word as well as a few other bad words. These are all uttered in two or three short scenes involving their usage in speech therapy and done in a completely non offensive light heart-ed comedic way. The producers of the film tried hard to appeal the rating, in favor of the rightfully deserved PG-13 rating, so that more people can see the film. They argued that by slapping the film with an R rating they're depriving younger viewers of a great history lesson (not to mention an inspiring lesson about overcoming adversity). They successfully argued their case in the UK where they got the movie lowered from a 15 rating to a 12A but the American MPAA was not so wise and refused to grant the ratings change. Which is a real shame considering the ratings board was established to help protect young film viewers, not punish them. I've never had much faith in the MPAA though and have long ignored their biased and manipulated stances. It's too bad the film business relies on them so greatly though. The film is a great and important movie and should be seen by those of all ages.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsKmmH2ftXQ",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Great acting from the entire cast.,"It's amazing , the fascination people have with the British Royal family and how well films seem to do that have this odd family as the subject. The Kings speech is a an excellent movie that taught me a thing or two about the history of what happened when Edward VIII abdicated and his less confident , stammering , brother took over the royal reigns. It's true that Colin Firth is brilliant in the lead role role but i was as , impressed ( if not more ) with Geoffrey Rush who played his speech therapist. This is such an easy film to watch and the 1 hour 51 minutes flies by. If i have to be critical it is that i was a little disappointed with the climax of the movie when the king makes his famous war address.

An entertaining and lavish crowd-pleasing event,"Much like The Fighter, I saw The King's Speech just before Christmas and never got around to writing a review until now. It had been hyped since its premiere at the festivals in Telluride and Toronto in September, and was always thought to be a front runner for the big prize at the Academy Awards. I clamoured to see the movie as it got more hyped as the weeks went on, and when I finally got to see the film in limited release, in a surprisingly packed theatre no less, I was more than just a little surprised.Taking its tale from a true story, Prince Albert, the Duke of York (Colin Firth) has a stammer and cannot speak properly in front of a crowd, or just about anyone. Many ""unconventional"" treatments are sought to try and fix it (the audience sadly does not get to see just how many), before the future Queen Mother Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) finds Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian living in London whose eccentric methods just may do the trick. After a rather disappointing first session, Albert leaves in an aggravated hurry, not thinking Logue's methods were of any use. But as it becomes clear that he may soon get a seat on the throne as the King of England, Albert heads back to see if Logue can truly help him overcome his speech problems.While British period pieces have always been Oscar fodder, they typically run rather long and despite housing incredible performances, usually end up being rather stuffy and boring (Stephen Frears' The Queen is a particular standout in my mind). And while there is a bit of stuffiness and boredom in some of its proceedings, The King's Speech manages to evoke an even greater sense of emotion than I thought it ever would. It is heartbreaking in some instances, outrageously hilarious in others, and when it gets to certain crescendos, deeply moving. The controversial and much discussed scene involving Firth yelling out a series of expletives in anger is of particular note, because it manages to be all three at once. But above all, the film manages at all times to be a crowd-pleasing event, always anticipating the audience's reaction. Having seen a plethora of films last year ranging from incredible to absolute garbage, I can say this film was the one that elicited the most varied and prominent reactions from the audience.While all of the technical elements are as great as you expect them to be, it is the acting that delivers in spades at every turn.Firth is simply magnificent as Albert and future King George VI. He pours his heart into every scene, and helps take the audience on the wild range of emotions the film helps deliver. He is enchanting and animated in every single one of his scenes, and you just cannot help but feel for him throughout his ordeal and ultimate quest to overcome his stammer. Firth is simply inspiring, and delivers yet another incredible performance to add to his already overflowing collection. His work in A Single Man was already enough to deserve every accolade possible. His work here only further establishes it.While Rush's performance as Logue is not as Earth-shatteringly incredible as Firth's, it is still rather excellent and considerably entertaining. He is more nuanced and low-key in his portrayal than I thought he would be, but he manages to hold his own even when he is eliciting scene chomping responses from Firth. His work here is much less pronounced (even though he has a few bizarre over-the-top scenes), but is the exact ingredient needed to make Firth's as astonishing as it is. Seeing them play off each other, just chatting between each other in often lengthy scenes, is worth seeing the film even if it was not the as wildly acclaimed as it was. Rush knows exactly what buttons and emotions to convey, and while he is nowhere near as consistent as Firth has been, he still manages to prove what an awesome talent he is.Supporting turns from Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall, Derek Jacobi and the always reliable Guy Pierce are all great, and help keep the film as lively as possible. Carter as Elizabeth is of particular note, because even though she is completely overshadowed by Firth and Rush, she still delivers some of her best work in her role. It is a thankless job as she is more of a background figure than anything else, but her grace and silent affections are quite visible at all times. She is the woman behind the man, and she always manages to make something of her character in every scene she gets. Her great work here more than helps to wash out some of the awful taste she left in her ridiculously over-the-top performance as the Red Queen in the horrifically disappointing Alice in Wonderland.But for all its greatness and how incredibly entertaining a film that The King's Speech is, I found that it was merely content with being a great film driven by incredible performances, and nothing more. I have had trouble in the weeks following seeing the film just trying to pin-point what holds the film back from eternal greatness, and it has held me back from writing how I felt about the film. I do not want to dwell or criticize it like some have for how it feels like a glorified ""Movie of the Week"" (only for fleeting moments, never to the exaggerated depths some have indicated), but in a year that gave us such wildly original films like Black Swan, Inception and The Social Network, which really challenged us as an audience, The King's Speech seems merely content as being an entertaining throwaway. It is a great film, but compared to others, it just does not seem great enough.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

The King Speaks Loud and Clear,"At last! - a movie that one can unashamedly applaud. Superficially, this is a historical drama about the Abdication Crisis and its effects on the Royal Family of the day. What it is really about,or, if you prefer, at a deeper level, it is the story of one person's struggle to conquer the inadequacies of their upbringing and confront their deepest fears. It is also a film about commitment, loyalty and friendship - and their opposites.The acting is high quality throughout, though Timothy Spall as Churchill is stretching the casting somewhat. But he and Elizabeth Bonham Carter, Derek Jacobi and Guy Pearce are very much in supporting roles. It is Colin Firth, as George VI, and Geoffrey Rush, as Lionel Logue, the speech therapist, who carry the film. The acting is superb from both, but it is Rush who is utterly outstanding.You may need to be English to fully appreciate the nuances of this movie (e.g. the manner of the Queen's deft side-stepping of Logue's wife's invitation to stay for dinner). But anyone with a little life experience can identify with the predicament of being in a demanding situation not of one's choosing and through no fault of one's own - except that in the King's case, there was nowhere to run and nowhere to hide.

I do not criticize nor belittle people with speech impediment, it was merely not a theatrical set of events that needed to be dramatized for a feature film.

"Rather splendid, my good chap","Another week, another Best Picture nominee. And with the Oscars less than a day away, I thought it only fitting to review the film firming as the favourite to knock off David Fincher and The Social Network. That film is The King's Speech, a risky effort by director Tom Hooper with a story that is unique to say the very least. Comprising of an impressive cast including actor's actor Colin Firth, one of my favourites in Helena Bonham Carter and Australia's favourite son, Geoffrey Rush, it more than lives up to its reputation as the film to beat.Firth is Albert, Duke of York, a man unexpectedly thrust into power as King George VI with his family, and entire country, in disarray. To make matters worse, he suffers from a terrible stammer, which does not bode well for a man required to do his fair share of public speaking on the job. So his wife Elizabeth (the future Queen Mother) enlists the help of eccentric Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue to succeed where all others have failed. Lionel and the King proceed to form an unlikely friendship in a grand, royal film of the most intimate degree.By this stage, Firth has become almost a shoo-in for Best Actor, and for good reason. But perhaps just as important as his performance is the way he is characterised in the film's earliest scenes. Here we have an inherently unpleasant man, whose frustration with being unable to deal with his stammer results in a short temper and bad attitude. It was crucial, then, for Hooper and writer David Seidler to evoke the viewer's sympathy nice and early to ensure we maintain interest in the story and its characters. That is exactly what is achieved in the opening scene as the Duke, utterly petrified, tries his best to deliver a speech in public but manages only a few words before the crowd gives up on him.I think it was also wise to inject the film with other infrequent sub-plots, while still keeping Bertie and Lionel's burgeoning friendship at the core. The King's Speech deals with, among other things, the death of King George V, the rise to power of his reckless son Edward VIII, and Hitler's initiation of World War Two. Some may have found it easy to be cynical about a British wartime film that deals with nothing but two peoples' friendship, but Hooper denies them this right. Historically accurate or not, these minor plot points keep the film fresh and gracefully compliment the main story.A key element of the film's impressive depth in storytelling is just how difficult Bertie finds it to overcome his impediment. Where other films might overcome the problem as soon as a breakthrough is made, in The King's Speech the subject constantly regresses, taking him and Lionel back to 'square one', as it were, and suggesting the issue is more complex than first thought. Not only does this compound audience sympathy, but it makes the conclusion more intense and, ultimately, more satisfying.This is an extremely mature piece of filmmaking, and while I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to anyone my age, it would come with the disclaimer of 'know what to expect'. And while it isn't my favourite film up for Best Picture this year, I would not complain if it walked away with the top prize in, oh, ten hours from now.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

It will fill you with joy,"In opening, I must say this is a film I would recommend to my friends. The story perfectly tells us how Bertie, unfit to be a king, overcome his speech impediment and leads his country through the war. The script is laid out cleverly and the film is well-paced, so we don't have time to be bored. This moving tale is witty and I appreciated the dry British sense of humor.The actor's game is splendid and excellent and I must say everyone did a solid job in this film. Colin Firth's performance is brilliant and Helena Bonham Carter is perfect as the haughty Queen consort. She brightens every scene she enters and the way she encourages her husband is brave and lovely. As Lionel Logue, Geoffrey Rush is very good and very funny. They are all excellent.What is interesting in this film is that it isn't all about the Royal family and their duties. Otherwise, it would have been boring. Colin Firth compels attention and sympathy in order to make the watcher interested. Moreover the pictures are bright and beautiful.All in all, The King's Speech is a must-see film that catches your eyes and tears at your guts. Full of emotions, this biopic is perfect and you can see it twice without being bored. It will just fill you with joy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Deserved Best Picture,"The Kings Speech is a film that's difficult to place in terms of plot; it's certainly about more than a speech and is something of a historical recount involving the British monarchy as well as a simple story about a man overcoming a problem in order to truly be himself. But beyond all that, at its heart it's a friendship story and in no small part due to Geoffrey Rush. The chemistry he has with Colin Firth brings an extra dynamic to their scenes and performances and with the assistance of a well played plot and sparky dialogue the two are able to bounce off of each other to the very end. And the course they take is full of wit and humor, but also manages to lay something a little deeper and emotive.The picture took home the year's Best Picture Oscar and many have criticized the decision incessantly since. However, those who have not seen the film shouldn't pay heed as The King's Speech is in fact possibly the finest film to win the Academy Award in the past decade.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
King's hard work,"This story is about George VI who is to be king of England. However, he has very serious problem ""stuttering"". He and people around him work very hard in order to overcome this problem. What is going to wait for the climax? This film is based on the royal people. Actually I haven't seen such a movie to be pointed on ""Royal"", so this time I really came to know how hard it is to be king. I learned a lot of things from this film. What I like in this film is that the cooperation of George VI and people around him. It is very moving, and I thought that people who create this film are amazing. I should have seen this at the movie theater! On the whole, for me, it is very touching!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Simple Masterpiece,"From the beginning scene in this film, where Colin Firth, then the Duke of York, struggles so much to speak in front of a large audience, you can tell that not only will the acting in this movie be incredible, but so will the movie itself.From then on it move, albeit somewhat slowly, through the different stages of Firth's speech therapy. First his wife, portrayed by the always-amazing Helena Bonham Carter, finds him a speech therapist, played very well by Geoffrey Rush, and then he goes through the numerous stages of therapy, while encountering various struggles along the way, and eventually becoming king. This is also set to a classic score by Alexandre Despalt the truly compliments the mood and atmosphere of the film.Now, I agree that that might not sound very entertaining. Who wants to watch Frith and Rush talk to each other for two hours while Bonham Carter looks on? And yet, it is the way these incredible actors bring the characters to life that, combined with this little-known tale from history, makes this movie so good.And the acting truly is top-notch. Colin Firth delivers his best performance--and in my opinion, one of the best performances in cinematic history (although I can't pretend to be an expert on that sort of stuff)--and was totally deserving of winning the Oscar. Helena Bonham Carter is impeccable, although I might be a little biased as she is my favorite actress, but I know I'm not the only one who believes she deserved an Oscar as well. Geoffrey Rush is also great, in my opinion the weaker of the three performances, but still one of the best of the year. Others throughout the movie, such as Guy Pearce, Derek Jacobi, Michael Gambon, Timothy Spall (who does an amazing Winston Churchill), and even Jennifer Ehle all do very well in their respective rolls. It's really a master-class of ingenious British actors and actresses who all work together and help create this unique and wonderful film.The story, too, is extremely fascinating, as it is definitely one you won't hear about in history class. You really get to learn how the royal system works, and it touches on the relationships between certain members of the royal family, and also how they live. I would definitely recommend this movie, even if you don't tend to like history movies in general, because if you look past all of that, it's still a very uplifting story--you will be rooting for Firth the entire way, believe me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
If we were equals!,"I strongly believe that this film can be summed up in two sentences:1. In here, it's better if we're equals.2. If we were equal, I wouldn't be here.Two sentences are uttered by the two main characters of the film: King George VI and the speech therapist. A speech therapist (Lionel Logue) says ""in here, it's better if we're equals"". What he means by this is that we, the king and an ordinary citizen are equals here (speech therapy office) and both are human beings, whether he is a king or an ordinary citizen. When someone has a speech problem and he is a stammer, it does not matter if he is a king or an ordinary citizen. Both must be treated in the same way. By equal he means that two ordinary human beings (regardless of their social status) are the same. And what he means here is where people go to treat their problems and illnesses. This is a normal place and the person who comes here is not necessarily a special person and anyone can get this disease. In fact, Lionel believes that this is a public place, not a special place.But the future king has two different purposes than the words equal and here. What he means by equal is that we are not equal because you (Lionel) do not stammer, but I'm a stammer. So the two have a completely different definition of the word equal and it seems that each of them thinks the opposite is wrong. King means here, a place where very special people come, and whoever comes here is definitely in the worst possible situation. In fact, for the King, this is a special place, not a public place.Anyone who is in here can come up with a different definition of ""equal"".The behavior of the King is defined in other parts of the film based on the same view. He does not look at his enemy as a king when he sees the film of Hitler's speech. He finds himself in a place where he can't speak, but Hitler is in a position where he speaks extremely well. He is in here and knows he is not equal to Hitler. As it was in reality: Britain did not have a German military position at the beginning of World War II, and German military superiority over Britain was evident.The King was a stammer, which made him not equal to others. He always felt inferior. When he talks to his brother, he feels that ""I'm a weak person"". He feels the same way when he talks to the prime minister or when he talks to the speaker of parliament. The King has a problem, and that is stammering, but that problem makes him feel nowhere equal to others.The same analysis can be provided for Lionel's behavior. Lionel really believes in the word ""equal"". Considering himself a wise man, he advised the future king not to think about his relationship with his brother and to think more about the future of Britain. It does not matter to Lionel that the King might be angry at what he said. Lionel considers himself equal to him and, therefore, tries to help him solve his problem.Lionel feels that he can be a good actor because he considers himself successful in his career and has high self-confidence. He thinks that when he can be equal to an actor on the stage.He spreads this equality everywhere: when he is with his sons, he plays with them and considers himself equal to them.Lionel always finds himself in an equal position, not just in one position: when he confronts his wife. He was not afraid to equal himself with the king, but he didn't dare to complete his words in front of his wife. Let us not forget that he didn't fully tell the story of the king to his wife. Also, when he realizes that his wife has come home, anxiety and fear take over his being, because he does not know how to introduce the important guest of the family.In contrast, the king always considers himself inferior to others. Except for once.With the help of Lionel, the king overcomes his problem and can deliver an effective speech that will keep the British people standing against Hitler. In the final scene, King calls Lionel ""my friend"".When the king ignores ""here"", he reaches the position of ""equal"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

A Well Crafted Drama Without the Frills,"7 January 2011. A stunning movie that has no sex and little or no action or special effects? The KING'S SPEECH relies on performance and a well crafted, tightly focused script, and deliberate editing that directs the audience's attention both intimately as well as internationally on the personal drama that enveloped King George VI of Britain and his speech impediment. Unlike the psychological delusions found in the BLACK SWAN, THE KING'S SPEECH is able to capture both the intimately relational drama between two individuals while providing a tense filled context of the political and cultural environment and importance of the outcome of the King's efforts in addressing his fears. Unlike other historical pieces focused on famous leaders, YOUNG VICTORIA (2009) wasn't able to capture the cultural and political intrigue, FROST/NIXON (2008) didn't quite have the same personal demons and flawless pacing and editing, W (2008) that had a weak performance in one of its minor characters that intruded on the movie, ELIZABETH THE GOLDEN AGE (2007) that suffered from a convoluted, clumsy script and underdeveloped characters.

you can keep your shilling,"It is 1939 and Britain's defence of the realm against the impending Nazi blitzkrieg depends on the king not stammering during a radio broadcast.Of course, the war effort was in fact more complex, but hats off to the myth-makers responsible for The King's Speech in spinning this tale so skillfully towards such a conclusion. History and films should never be conflated, and anyone who wants to harp on about ""historical inaccuracies"" in a movie should have their library card confiscated.Leaving the real King George VI aside, the cinematic regent finds his selfish big brother abdicating at a time when the nation is facing its darkest days. He employs a maverick Aussie speech therapist to help him with his speech impediment, and their bromance culminates in the king successfully addressing the nation, in turn kick-starting the war effort and taking the first step to giving Jerry what-ho.Firth is suitably regal and vulnerable. As for Geoffrey Rush - has he ever made a bad film? Bonham Carter, as usual, drips aristocratic ice. Guy Pearce plays bad guy Edward a shade too buffoonish, but you have to expect heightened contrasts when cinema takes on history.There have to be thousands of stories from WWII that are more inspiring, and significant, than the tale of one extremely privileged being's attempts to get a speech right, but fair dues to the film-makers for keeping this tale credulous.

Firth V Rush,"This film is basically a two actor piece with Firth playing the prince who is horror struck at the sense of duty to millions and history in the making which is bearing down upon him, and Rush as the kind yet damaged first world war veteran and failed actor whose initial concern in speech therapy was to help those fellow veterans whose speech had been affected by the stress of war. Both are defined by their voices with Rush being overlooked for acting roles because of his Australian accent (""only RP here old boy"") and Firth forced to engage in public speaking out of duty to office despite everyone knowing and dreading his terrible stammer. The scenes with both of them bouncing off each other are riveting. The other characters and scenes seem only there to facilitate this face off between the two. How Colin Firth can be considered the lead actor and Geoffrey Rush a supporting actor is surely a profound injustice to the latter: it must be a close run thing as to which is on the screen most.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Lived up to the hype,"I first heard about The King's Speech when the Oscars aired. It kept getting nominations, and when I saw enough of a trailer to get an idea of the plot, I *had* to see it. I'm a fan of WWII history, and this was a story I hadn't heard anything about before.Fast forward a few months. It finally comes out on Blueray, so we pick it up from RedBox. I'm a little worried about liking the movie because everyone says how excellent it is, and usually, the movies never live up to the hype. I'm happy to say that this one does. Colin Firth did a fabulous job playing George VI, and every time he stepped up to a microphone or had to have an important discussion with someone, I felt so, so terribly bad for him. I get nervous when speaking publicly. Sometimes it gets to the point where I feel a little faint. Sure, my voice might be shaky and whatever I'm saying might not make sense, but at least I'm still able to get words out. I can barely imagine how it would feel to be him.I also loved the queen! She made me laugh out loud several times. The actress (I should probably look up her name) plays some weird roles in some movies, but she was fabulous and perfect for this.The movie was about two hours long. I have a short attention span for movies - I'm usually wondering when they'll end an hour into them - but I'm happy to report I didn't look at my watch once during the entire show. In my opinion, this movie couldn't have been made any better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Beautifully shot and superbly acted yet at times I thought the story was a little slow and at times boring.,"The King's Speech stars Colin Firth as King George VI and Geoffery Rush as his speech therapist Lionel Logue. The film follows King George VI's, or Bertie's, rise to become King of England, and his struggle with his speech impediment while also dealing with the life of being in the Royal Family. All the while the beginning of World War II is lingering in the background providing for much of the political side of the film.The direction of the film was brilliantly done by Tom Hooper, especially during the scenes between Firth and Rush. Most of the scenes are just simple conversations between the two but Hooper creates this beautiful environment, often in Lionel's office, reminding me a lot of a painting, or perhaps a portrait to more accurate. He also excels during George's speeches to the public by really creating a sense of anxiety in the audience that George himself is feeling with his speech impediment. Most of all, he captures the post World War II England beautifully immersing you into the environment.The most impressive aspect of The King's Speech by far is the cast. Firth is at his absolute best as King George VI and won the much deserved Best Actor Oscar. He brings out George's strong, stubborn personality while also showing his vulnerability while very realistically speaking with a stutter. The best scenes with Firth are during his sessions with his speech therapist, Geoffery Rush. They play off each other so well during these scenes and they are only strengthened by Hooper's direction. Helena Bonham Carter plays Queen Elizabeth and as always is a strong presence on the screen that only aides Firth's performance as the King. Guy Pearce also shows up a little during the film, as George's brother Edward, or King Edward for a small stint, and proves that once again (Animal Kingdom) that he can keep up with high caliber performers.The story itself is where I felt The King's Speech was faulty, and it may not be fair to just say it's the King's Speech or just any historical film in general. The scenes between Firth and Rush are incredibly well done and pretty fun to watch on screen. However the scenes that are in between are where I feel it slows down and I found myself just wanting Rush to come back on screen. I do understand that those scenes are important to the character development of George because they mainly deal with the Royal Family, but I just found them to be too boring.Overall, The King's Speech is very well made film and in terms of a historical biography, it does it's job. I just found it dull at times but luckily the direction and casting was enough to keep me entertained and interested in the characters. I did enjoy the inside look it gave at the Royal Family, and especially what their role is in politics. The pressure and stress that simply being born in to a family is a pretty unbelievable thought. Being born into royalty and the pressure that not only comes from your family, but The Royal Family at that. It's well worth a viewing even if it's only to just see the performances, but as a film on the whole I thought it failed with the overall story and it's not the production's fault, I just think the source material wasn't really there to begin with. I felt like I was watching a history textbook and that's the kind of material I try to escape when watching a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"Deliberate, heartfelt, softly powerful and beautiful, justly deserves its Academy Award","The King's Speech, the film, is very much like the king's speech, the speech. It is deliberate, heartfelt, softly powerful and beautiful to the ear (and the eye). Despite its backdrop of historical events of global and continuing significance, The King's Speech focuses relatively minutely upon Bertie (Colin Firth), otherwise known as King George VI, and Lionel (Geoffrey Rush), his unconventional speech therapist. Burdened from childhood with a stammer, Bertie must deal with his duty of public appearances, a domineering and unsympathetic father and a free-spirited brother who is uninterested in his destiny as the crown prince. The film follows Bertie's speech lessons and budding friendship with Lionel, as circumstances raise him to the office of monarch of a nation on the brink of war.The script feels like a play in its pacing and witty dialog, yet Tom Hooper directs it into a film with a simple, personal and artistic style. He often utilizes off-center framing, fish-eye close-ups and several sequences of following a character's back as he moves through rooms and passages, allowing the viewer to see every mixed emotion as it registers on a face and to really feel the world from Bertie's perspective. Firth gives a vulnerable, powerful and nuanced performance in his Oscar winning role. Rush, Helena Bonham Carter (as Bertie's wife Elizabeth), Guy Pierce (as Bertie's brother David, King Edward) and Michael Gambon (as Bertie's father, King George V) turn in the winningly solid performances one would expect from these gifted actors. Timothy Spall does a highly recognizable Winston Churchill without falling off the caricature deep end, and Jennifer Ehle (whom many may remember as Elizabeth to Firth's Darcy in 1996's Pride & Prejudice) pops up now and again as Lionel's wife Myrtle. This quiet, aesthetic, inspirational and charming film justly deserves its Best Picture Academy Award.EntertainmentReviewRevue.wordpress.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Problem is, George has a stammering problem and he is supposed to make speeches in his new job. What to do?This historical drama works because the audience is told all that is going on, and you could understand what was happening and what was at stake even if you were a layman with little understanding of the period or of the British Royal Family. The performances are good and so are the costumes and decor. But the movie did remind me of a tour of Britain and Scotland I went on in 1999, which included seeing the Tower of London and the royal jewels. The tour guide said that each generation of the royal family wants an heir and a spare, and it was fortunate that there was a spare in this generation.

The King's Speech,"THE KING'S SPEECH – 9.4/10Director: Tom HooperWriter: David SeidlerMost intelligent scripts are not written out of pure imagination. There must certainly be a mix of brute reality and concocted fantasy. The King's Speech is one of those films that balance the nuances of fictional storytelling with realism exceptionally well, to an extent where it provoked me to research the inspirations of the writer who came up with such brilliance in simplicity.The film is a classic case of intelligent script writing. We frequently come across films where we are not sure what happened in the end. By this I don't mean films that have complicated plots, but instead films in which viewers are lost and rendered hopeless. If we being to explore the myriad elements the scriptwriter has used to produce this marvel, it might well serve as a little old school text book lesson. While I do believe that the purpose of art is to redefine definitions and break rules, this one almost seems to stick to archaic definitions but much to ones delight.The film has a strong protagonist, the roscius Colin Firth (King George IV), with an even stronger antagonist, well. Mr.stammer. Every character that does anything in the film is impacting, affecting, and related to in some manner or the other to the protagonist and antagonist. Even the King's brother's character has so tidily been knit into the entire scheme of speech impairment, no matter how little on screen time he received. The writer never forgets his central plot and focus, and keeps every character, their individual stories coming back to the central theme of the film – The King's speech impairment.He takes the film to a meaningful conclusion but first builds towards it systematically, craftily placing each stone, each brick in the right position to ensure the edifice of the film is flawless. What matters even more is the climax is not bigger than it should have been nor was it subdued or understated for sake of humility or otherwise. The achievement of the film was to make the viewer feel the joy of both, the King who just overcame his toughest hurdle, and the shrink who knew what he had achieved. Like the insignificant audience to the King's speech, we too are awed, enamored and pleased by what we are hearing. With a very weak premise – A King's Speech impairment to begin with, it is a mammoth task to build a film with so much dimension, several characters each carefully delineated, absolutely no lose ends or irrelevant sub-plots, a thick central plot and yet there was time to sprinkle ample humor. A point worthy of mention was the humor in the film. It does not rely on age old situational tactics or awkward everydayness inflated to extract laughs from a fatigued audience. The film has exceptional eloquence as though it was a book and not a film, and the humor is well integrated, flowing as smoothly as the prose with the rest of the film.The acting is top notch, and each individual more than outperforms the other. The characters are real and believable and are consistent throughout the film, never once showing signs of their true selves. It was acting that carried the film further than what it would have gone had the acting gone wrong or was not appropriate in the given circumstances. When you have several conversations between a shrink and his patient, it is the acting and the script that will keep you absorbed, and nothing less, if nothing more.Camera techniques were interesting to watch. You had the use of wide angle in closed rooms, contrary to its purpose. The magnificent halls of the royalty palaces and grand architecture of yester year London have been captured and used to great effect. The rule of thirds, though I am not sure what purpose it served in context of the film, added a sense of dimension to the scene and character. Close crops were introduced strictly when needed. Use of empty space is to perfection; I wonder if it was added to increase the sense of restriction an individual with speech impairment feels, as it certainly played on my subconscious mind and was only noticed when I made an effort to.David Seidler who suffered from the same problem himself has done justice to his cause by writing such a witty, emotional and simple yet a grand film. With whatever cues the makers could take from reality, the film certainly manages to deliver at all levels. All in all, The King's Speech is a perfect family drama, with several layers within it, and is an all weather, mood and season film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Great acting, but nothing unexpected","There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush play marvelously, the sets are perfect, the direction great. However, that was all to be expected. It is true that Mr. Firth needed to prove to people that he can act in stuff different from silly romantic comedies, but I knew he was a great actor. Same goes for Geoffrey Rush. The idea for the plot is in the history books. All one has to do here is not screw it up, and they didn't.So, from a pure technical standpoint, the movie deserves a perfect ten. From a personal viewpoint, though, it was only a good movie, nothing spectacular. As such, I can't rate it highest, because I know I saw movie that I liked a lot more, at a level of perfection much inferior than King's Speech.Bottom line: There are no twists, there is nothing really surprising in the film.

Here is a prince, son of the King, living a life we could only dream of, really out of touch. But because of his struggle through his speech impediment, a King is made a man, some we can relate with. We all share the feelings of parental affirmation, insecurity, weakness, vulnerability and fear in all social economic classes. And just like us, he got through struggle with a honest to life friend, not another YES man that the monarchy is surrounded with. The climactic speech is so intense and suspenseful. The Kings Speech will probably win best picture.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
King's Speech is a drama based on the speech impediment of King George VI.,"The King's Speech is a drama based on the speech impediment of King George VI. The fantastic cast includes Colin Firth as Bertie/King George, Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, and Helena Bonham Carter as Elizabeth, the kings' wife. Based on true events, this film follows Bertie as he works to overcome his challenges with stammering while also developing a close relationship with his speech therapist, Lionel Logue.Desperate to help her husband, Elizabeth finds Lionel to help. Through his eccentric methods, Lionel makes a little bit of progress with Bertie. The pressure to overcome the stammering becomes greater when Bertie is unwillingly forced to become the king. He is well aware of his inability to stand up for himself, his speech challenges, and the burden of leading a country. As the pressure of war approaches, the new King must find a way to convince his people that he is a capable leader. The public has always been aware of his inability to give a speech and are unsure how this is will affect his leadership. We watch as George struggles to find his voice, find his courage, and finally find a friend who believes in him.A movie with a similar theme of being a reluctant leader who had to stand up to great adversity was King Arthur. The Saxons were attacking England, and King Arthur had to lead the people to safety. He also had to lead his knights even though some were against the mission.The film was primarily set in the style of Georgian architecture. The room where Lionel and Bertie held their therapy sessions has a beautiful old world wall. The scale of the large old peeling paint wall with a lone couch against it contrast the majesty of the king. In the city, the shots of the posters stating ""God Save the King"" increases the pressure placed upon Bertie to lead his people with courage. He knows the posters were in support of his brother David.Throughout the film, we find ourselves rooting for the king to overcome his speech impediment. The support and humor of his wife and Lionel are touching. Although this is a serious drama, there are small bits of humor and humanity. We see a glimpse of the human side of the Royal Family.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Masterful,"Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush, with admirable support from Helena Bonham Carter lead this wonderful historic record with breathtaking ease. The characterisation, understated portrayals and absolute grasp of their craft offers an incite into a world that has only been guessed at.Rush is superb, Firth masterful and with the delightful and wonderfully rounded balance of Helena Bonham Carter - I was absolutely captivated for the entire movie. Dealing with a stammer/stutter in the present day is a difficult proposition - back then, with a country on the verge of conflict and a more innocent age - it must have been crippling. This movie is why I watch films of this kind - I was given such a stimulating experience and marvelled at the direction, performances and historical content I felt educated as well as entertained.Thanks to the production, which was flawless - the direction which allowed the film to flow and each and every person who worked on this masterpiece of story telling.

"I just wished the scriptwriter had realised he was writing a script, not rewriting history","In the British constitution, the King's (or Queen's) Speech is the annual address given by the monarch to Parliament, setting out the Government's legislative programme for the coming parliamentary session. This film, however, uses the word ""speech"" in a different sense; it tells the story of the efforts of King George VI, the father of our current Queen, to overcome his stammer.The film opens in 1925, when the future monarch was still known as HRH The Prince Albert, Duke of York. He was a younger son whom few expected ever to accede to the throne; the heir apparent was his elder brother, Edward Price of Wales. The two brothers are utterly unlike in character. Edward is handsome, charismatic and eloquent. Albert, shy and lacking in self-confidence, is widely regarded as dull, even by members of his own family, especially his overbearing father King George V. He is due to give the closing speech at the 1925 Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium, but because of his stammer is unable to get his words out. In desperation he turns to Lionel Logue, an unorthodox Australian-born speech therapist. Although Logue, a failed actor, has no formal qualifications, he gained a high reputation with his work teaching shell-shocked troops after World War I, and believes that he can help the Duke. As the two work together they gradually become friends, although Logue initially shocks the Duke with his informality, addressing him not (as etiquette demands) as ""Your Royal Highness"", or even by his full Christian name Albert, but by the diminutive ""Bertie"", otherwise only used by his family.At one time it might not have mattered very much, except to the individual concerned, whether a junior member of the Royal Family suffered from a speech defect. In the twenties and thirties, however, things were changing. The invention of radio and cinema newsreels meant that ordinary people could now hear the voices of their rulers in their own homes; George V had become an accomplished radio performer and broadcast a message to his subjects every Christmas. Dictators such as Hitler and Mussolini, both fluent orators, seized upon the new medium to spread their propaganda. Moreover, Bertie was not fated to remain a junior member of the Royal Family; the Abdication Crisis of 1936 meant that he was compelled, reluctantly, to ascent the throne which his brother had vacated to marry Mrs Simpson. The new King was forced to rely on Logue's assistance to help him perform his royal duties, especially after the outbreak of war, less than three years after his accession, meant that he had to act as spokesman for the nation.""The King's Speech"" is in many ways a good film, but its main fault is the way in which it tries to rewrite the historical record to bring it into line with standard received ideas. According to the standard received interpretation, Edward VIII was a Bad King, not only because he was vain and selfish but also because he was pro-Nazi, or at any rate pro-appeasement. Appeasement, of course, was a thoroughly Bad Thing, as were politicians like Baldwin and Chamberlain who supported it. The abdication was therefore a Good Thing in the long run because it got rid of Bad King Edward and replaced him with Good King George who was anti-Nazi and anti-appeasement and supported Churchill who of course was a very Good Thing and helped us win the war.There is some truth in this interpretation of history, but it involves some massive oversimplification of a much more complex reality, and this film does not just oversimplify that reality; it also distorts it, in three significant ways. Firstly, it shows Churchill as supporting the abdication, whereas in fact he, almost alone among Britain's political establishment, opposed it and supported Edward. (His only ally was the Fascist leader Oswald Mosley). Secondly, it implies that Baldwin came to regret his earlier support for appeasement and shows him apologising for this policy to the King on leaving office, whereas Baldwin's policy was continued after his retirement by his successor Chamberlain, with Baldwin's full support. Thirdly, it ignores altogether George VI's support for Chamberlain, with whom he appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace after the Munich Conference.And yet in many ways the film is a very good one. The acting is of a very high standard, and the three nominations for acting Oscars are well deserved. Helena Bonham Carter bears little physical resemblance to the late Queen Mother, but is nevertheless well able to give a convincing impression of her formidable personality. As for Colin Firth as Bertie and Geoffrey Rush as Logue, in an ideal world they would be nominated for a joint Oscar for best combined acting performance, as I felt that theirs was a partnership where the whole was greater than the sum of the parts. The film tells the story of how these two very different men learned to work together, with a certain initial distrust giving way to respect and eventually friendship, and the obvious rapport between Firth and Rush helps to convey the sense of a similar rapport between their characters. Of the other cast members, I would single out Guy Pearce's contribution as the arrogant, self-centred Edward.Overall, Tom Hooper's film tells a story of warmth and humanity and tells it well, often with the aid of humour. (The scene where Logue persuades Bertie to repeat a string of profanities went down well in the cinema). The story of how George VI overcame his problems to become one of Britain's best-loved monarchs is an inspiring one; like Stephen Frears' ""The Queen"" from a few years ago, this film gives a surprisingly positive picture of the British monarchy in a supposedly republican world. I just wished that the scriptwriter had realised that he was writing a script, not rewriting history. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Great Storytelling, Entertaining Characters","The King's Speech is about a man named Prince Albert (Colin Firth) who must take the throne at King George VI after his father's (Michael Gambon) death, however, he is held back by his fear--that he stammers when speaking to others. He fears he cannot be the voice of his people if he cannot speak clearly and confidently for them; especially since the second World War is approaching. After speech therapist after speech therapist, he finally finds Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who, through some ups and downs, attempts to help him work past his stammering and speak confidently.The story of The King's Speech is mostly based on a true story, although the relationships between Albert and Lionel is slightly exaggerated to allow watchers to relate to the characters on a deeper level. The characters are acted out wonderfully and are realistic despite the slight exaggeration in interpretation. The cinematography (directed by Tom Hooper) is very well done; the camera and lighting techniques help capture the tension in Albert's public speaking and difficulties he experiences along the way. The music used is classical, and helps encapsulate the ""royal"" setting perfectly.A similar movie would be Up in the Air. While the two movies may not seem alike, the similar cinematographic effects such as camera and lighting helps give off a similar atmosphere. Both movies also have similar main characters, despite Up in the Air not being about a speech impediment, both characters are somewhat reserved, stubborn, and independent. Both films are considered dramas, rightfully.Personally, I enjoyed The King's Speech. It was entertaining, and I barely was able to guess what would happen next (which I find as a fault in dramatic films storytelling). I love historical films, so my expectations were already well, and The King's Speech was able to surpass them within the first thirty minutes of viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Oscar-winning King should be the tagline,"Well... just by giving a 10 out of 10, do I have to say more? Do I have to spell it out for you? At this point it really doesn't matter what I'm gonna say but what you've seen... this movie shows what effort can do... to be more redundant (according to this topic, of course)... this movie is shouting every possible emotion on every character, and believe me, there was no problem on talking here. Colin Firth, keeps surprising me with every movie he takes part in. But, talking just in this case, what an amazing performance! Shyness, bad temper, impotence, medical problems, self-conscience issues, past traumas, inexperience in some cases, and that sense of great responsibility (it resembles to Lion King's Simba for this kind of feeling, ''I cannot be what I am''), all these feelings gathered and mixed in a chaotic way within Colin's character, and every one of them better than the other you've just seen. Perfect, in each and every single way to say it, JUST SAY IT: PERFECT PERFORMANCE, TOTALLY CHAOTICALLY PERFECT. Colin, you've got the whole responsibility with your character, and madly well done.

The king also needs to grow up like ordinary people,"No matter in life or on stage, stutterers often appear in the image of public jokes. People often make fun of their language barriers, or even ridicule them. No one can understand the sufferings of stutterers, but they often get ridicule when they have the potential to express. Their sufferings are only understood by nature. The king's speech begins with Colin. Fissner's trembling lips and tense facial muscles vividly expressed the pain that he could not express when he wanted to express his feelings. Maybe it was not only the pain, but also the anger, which originated from the hatred and helplessness of his own defects.

Excellent film well worth the 12 Oscar nominations it received.,"The soon-to-be King George VI, nicknamed Bertie, is emasculated by his family and a nanny when he is quite young, especially, his father deprecating him at every turn (Freudians, take heed!). Bertie has a severe stammer (stutter), though he can curse and speak when angry without difficulty, but not otherwise. It is discovered that he was originally left handed and was converted to being right handed. This is the highly emotional & largely true true story of the soon to be monarch, who facing a war (WW II)is fearful of performing his duties because of his disabling stammer. But what to do - speech therapists have a go without benefit until one highly unusual individual, Geoffry Rush as Lionel gets hold of him, literally, and attempts to work his magic. The film is a textbook case of Freudian analysis, though not identified as such in the film, in attempting to get at the cause of a debility in order to release the extreme tension it has on Bertie.So far as details, cinematography is excellent, as are casting, direction, acting, script, and editing in maintaining tension throughout the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Characters with personality!!,"I am impressed!! The good point of this movie which I want to introduce is only one.It is splendor of the performances of the casts. It may be said that a character meets the cast. A performance of Colin Firth of the part of George VI in particular is perfect. The figure reading the manuscript of his figure and speech to read ""Hamlet"" of Shakespeare aloud hard wants to support you unintentionally. The performance of George VI who was stammering for Firth would be very difficult, but his George VI was splendid. I want to know what kind of feeling he would play a human being called George VI with. In addition, the performance of Geoffrey Rush which played Lionel Logue which was Helena Bonham Carter and the speech clinician who performed the Elizabeth princess who is a wife of George VI is good at all.I think that the character of this movie has the personality that each one did well.

All ears on him,"All aboard the Stammer Train: the one that contorts mouths, twists tongues and causes more word jumbling, scrambling and tangling than somebody with a jackhammer pressed against their backside. Don't have a ticket? Well, you can take a stroll alongside this ride as it moves gradually and gives a bird's eye view in. Call it a courtesy, as this is one story that comes with overcoming an impediment that you might want to see as it's not just a bunch of stiff English blokes and blokettes in the '30s expunging emotion and sipping tea.The Duke of York (Colin Firth) was born into royalty: fancy home, finest dress, chauffeur and most importantly the people see him as a symbol of excellence and expect someone of his stature to take command. Except there's a dilemma: he's got a life long stammer and can't complete a full sentence without locking up or getting stuck. He's being groomed in case he's next in line of succession and has to make public speeches as well as broadcast on wireless radio where every flubber can be painfully heard. The supportive wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) wants to bring out the best for her husband and after many failed attempts she gets in contact with a sure-of-himself Australian speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush) who's known for being ""unorthodox"" and ""controversial."" His royal highness is mentally sharp and capable, though by this time he's at a point where he just wants to except what he has and move on as his whole life he's been told to just spit it out, not to mention belittled by his own family members including his own father King George V (Michael Gambon) and his brother the Prince of Wales (Guy Pearce).""The King's Speech"" has a dry sense of humor at times. There are some funny conversations between the Duke (or Bertie) and Dr. Logue (Lionel) as they attempt to become equals and break down previously built up barriers. Lionel is candid and direct, and Bertie is reserved and defensive. Some specialists only look at the physical maladies of the impediment, while this one attempts to go back to the root of the cause. They do exercises that include breathing, getting in physical shape and, who could forget, cursing up a storm, as Bertie is able to easily say a string of words when frustrated or mad. King George V has an illness, the Duke's brother has extracurricular activities that he doesn't want to give up and the Nazis are becoming a dark shadow over Europe. The Duke must make a decision to take charge and utilize all those speech lessons for a live address to the nation and a large portion of the world.This is a journey that extends over a period of years. ""The King's Speech"" comes with the good, bad, humorous and trying of times. The period had different people, different settings but the situation can be seen as similar to today with someone with a condition that not everyone understands and is often mistaken for being weaker than they really are. Colin Firth made it all come together: he's able to transition between held back to capable without skipping a beat in between. The setbacks he goes through are presented without being overwhelming and nailing the point home. It's treated with care and gives some room for viewers to decide their take. Geoffrey Rush plays a visionary who sees life from a different angle. He's cocksure but still has to think on his feet. What makes him likable is he's passionate about what he does, though the patient has to want it. This is not just about speech and politics, but also two men from different backgrounds sharing an unexpected friendship.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Witty. Fascinating. Sincere. A delightful film,"With so many great films coming out this year, I feel that The King's Speech will get lost amongst them all, to me at least, but that still doesn't mean it isn't a great film. It's about King George VI of Britain and how he overcame a fear of public speaking and a painful stammer in order to give a voice to his country in dire need of one at the start of World War II. The movie tells a pleasing, exciting, and very interesting story with a great cast of characters.A story like this is something that can be lost easily in a time where there was so much turmoil and confusion in the world and most of the focus was on the war itself and the main political leaders who helmed the main countries involved in the war. But it is not a story worth missing. It's a very interesting story that most definitely deserves to be told. It is triumphant and uplifting and provides a unique perspective in a time history books have familiarized us with so well. The storyline not only serves as a lead in to World War II, but it gives a lot of insight into the royal family in Britain at that time. It begins with George as the Duke of York, while his father was still in power. After his father dies his brother David becomes king but quickly resigns from the position to marry an American woman. George must be hailed in as King in a very spur of the moment manner, making the fight against his stammer that much more difficult. It is the kind of story that one must read into if they really want to know about it, but The King's Speech delivers this story in a very charming and fascinating manner. It kept me very interested, as well as entertained.The film combines a sort of dry British wit with dramatic sincerity. Some of the exchanges between Firth and Rush's characters are hysterical. It is a high quality comedy that doesn't wash over the film in excess, but displays itself quietly and respectfully. The rest of the film strays from being overly dramatic, but it still gives off a very serious vibe that keeps you engaged in the film. Tom Hooper over directs the film to an extent, despite there being a handful of very well crafted shots. The screenplay stays very witty and very articulate throughout the entire film and it covers up any directorial faults. The film keeps a nice pace that lags only slightly in the middle, but then picks up again for an engaging and delightful climax. The King's Speech is a very well made film that doesn't possess any glaring flaws.The cast is one of the highlights of this film and I expect the film to do very well at the Academy Awards in that aspect. Colin Firth puts forth a great effort as King George. There isn't a wasted line in the film for him, and he works through his character extremely well. He plays a very flawed character, but also keeps him likable and empathetic. We want nothing more but for him to succeed during the entire film. Geoffrey Rush plays Lionel Logue, George's speech therapist, and does a tremendous job in his role. He is one of the most likable characters in the film, despite having subtle flaws of his own. The relationship between Rush and Firth has an incredible amount of articulation and fascination behind it, and it keeps the film incredibly lively. The scenes with just Firth and Rush are undoubtedly the best of the entire film. Helena Bonham Carter plays Queen Elizabeth in a very entertaining role. Her character has a much more subtle importance to the whole film, and Carter does a magnificent job from start to finish.The King's Speech is one of those films that you just can't find any flaw worth complaining about. It tells a great story with a colorful cast of characters, each cast member putting forth a top notch performance. The film will delight you in every way and will lift your spirits in a very pleasing manner. There are so many films worth seeing in 2010, and this is definitely one of them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

meeting history means first wining the fight with his self,"Here is a film whose destiny is to gather a lot of statuettes on the Oscar night this year, and this may be one of its problems in my eyes. The combination between a personal drama doubled by a physical or psychological disability (the stammering of the duke of York to become King George VI of England) which allows for great principal role performances and the obsession of the big screen with the British dynasty may lead for the third time in the last two decades for royalties get an Oscar ovation. It is not that 'The King's Speech' lacks moments of good cinema, a good dramatic build-up and a human touch but somehow it is too much on the side of the predictable to my taste.Being duke of York is probably the most frustrating position on the planet maybe with the exception of being VP of the United States of America. You are one inch apart from the peak of the Universe, and yet most people in your kingdom or republic may not know your face. The spotlights fall so close and you are still in the shadows. Exceptional events do happen sometimes and the second-in-line is pushed ahead and needs to take responsibility. This is what happened with the duke of York who became king at the abdication of his brother Edward, just at the time the world and his country where to face the biggest challenge in history at the outbreak of the second world war. And yet, his historical fight was also a personal fight, as he head to overcome his stammering, a huge handicap at a time when leaders' speech inspired nations and the relatively new media of radio broadcast was the most efficient propaganda instrument in the war.The best moments of the film were for me the human dimensions that the characters of Bertie (King George VI) and Elizabeth received under the acting of Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter. I am no fan of the British royals, but I ended by really sympathizing with their representation in the movie. The personal fight of Bertie, his relation with the commoner family of his speech expert (Geoffrey Rush which is no less than wonderful as we can always expect from him) and the way he ends by facing the call of history at the right moment are well filmed and described. I liked less the way the historical context is described, with characters like king Edward or Winston Churchill reduced to their stereotype. There is one character though which draw my attention and this was Neville Chamberlain in a very exact supporting performance by Roger Parrott. I could not avoid thinking that this complex character and the dilemma of appeasement that marked his political career with the disastrous consequences did not yet get any screen version fit to the dimensions of the historical figure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Beautiful Story, Slow at Times.","Review:
'The King's Speech' is a historical-drama film directed by Tom Hooper.
I first watched this movie in English class when I was in high school. I guess my tastes in movies changed because I remember this being a long and boring movie. While it is a slow burn, the story being told is intriguing enough to keep you invested.
Colin Firth plays the future King George VI who, to cope with a stammer, sees Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian speech and language therapist. The men become friends as they work together, and after his brother (Guy Pearce) abdicates the throne, the new king relies on Logue to help him make his first wartime radio broadcast on Britain's declaration of war on Germany in 1939.
Everyone in this movie was on point, but the two leads truly shined and make this movie shine bright. Geoffrey Rush is one of those actors who isn't in a lot on American made films and gets lost in the balance of great actors working today. He was brilliant in this movie. He felt like a man trying to make a living for his family, then an opportunity of a lifetime comes up and he snatches it. Colin Firth does a good job as well. I wasn't held up on the stammering one bit, I thought I was actually watching a man struggling to speech.
This is a powerful, funny and deeply moving story, told against the backdrop of a critical juncture in modern history, of the emergence of a deep friendship out of a professional relationship between two men who would otherwise never have socially interacted. It does get a little slow at times and I checked to see how much longer the runtime has until its over. Though the story that's being told is intriguing.
Overall, the movie is stalked to the brim with great performances. It has a great script and a compelling story to keep you invested even in the slow moments.

Great Movie!,"This for me was just a movie that was laying around that i didn't expect much from, i expected it to be a slow and boring movie with not much happening. But i was wrong, you don't need to have explosions and guns everywhere to make a good movies, as proved many times before already.If you've ever gone through school, chances are you've more than once had to make a speech in front of a bigger group. This movie is just about that, how to overcome the fear of talking in front of masses of people. How everything just stops and you can't find the words to continue, and that's what's so good about this movie, i have many times found myself in similar situations during school, and that gives you great compassion for him, since you know what he must feel and most of us has all been there.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"One man, a speech therapist, made a difference in history","While I enjoy movies involving superheroes and science fiction such as Star Wars and Star Trek, there is a place in my heart for the intelligent movie with no violence. Especially those that require some knowledge of the history of the topic in order to fully understand them. This is such a movie and I could not have enjoyed the backdrop of history more than I did.
When British King George V died, at first the succession went smoothly, he was succeeded by his eldest son, who became King Edward VIII. However, Edward became infatuated with the divorced Mrs. Wallis Simpson and wanted to marry her. With the British government and those of the Dominions vehemently opposed to such an event, Edward chose abdication over the throne. This meant that his younger brother Albert, known as Bertie, ascended to the throne as George VI. A nearly lifelong stutterer, George VI found it nearly impossible to deliver a coherent speech.
Fortunately, Bertie had sought the assistance of speech therapist Lionel Logue and this is the story of their relationship and the time when Britain faced the existential crisis of war with Nazi Germany and her allies. It is a great story, for it gives insight into the history of the time. Edward VIII had many sympathies for Germany, in fact, the Nazis tried to use him as a pawn in their battle to defeat England. Meanwhile, George VI proved to be a powerful rallying symbol for the British nation as well as the Dominions.
One aspect that I really enjoyed was the depiction of Depression era England, where the people (even members of the Royal family) wore very thick winter clothing indoors due to the poor heating. To modern people, the crisis over Wallis Simpson seems overblown, but it is very well explained in this movie. The performances are all first rate and the relationships of all British subjects to their king is well done.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Beautiful story.,"This movie is about one king in Britain, King George v, show has difficulty in speaking. He is told to have a speech on the radio. He has a doctor friend named Logue. Logue always supports King George V, including treatment of the king's difficulty.I am attracted to the part when King George V finds out that he actually is able to speak a lot. I respect Logue because he knows how to let the king speak. Moreover, the actor of King George V, Colin Firth, makes the story more interesting and great. It must have been hard to act as if he has difficulty in speaking. How his expressions move and what he says make the viewers feel closer to the main character.The main message of this movie, in my opinion, is that trying hard and not giving up for something can make your goal come true. Also, friends or supporters around you are more important than you actually think. You should thank your supporters and keep working hard for your dream.In conclusion, the story of this movie is about King George V who tries to overcome his problem of difficulty in speaking. Bond between the king and the king's doctor, Logue, is strong and beautiful. The story teaches the viewers to try hard to conquer any problems. After all, this is a great movie which I recommend the most.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Solid historical drama,"The King's Speech (2010) directed by Tom Hooper, has won acclaim as one of the best films of the year. As everyone knows by now, it's the story of a speech pathologist who helps King George VI become the wartime orator that England needed.Colin Firth is outstanding as King George VI, Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful as Queen Elizabeth, and Geoffrey Rush is equally good as Lionel Logue, the speech teacher.You can't help but enjoy this film, because it's about decent people trying to cope with a truly serious problem. (No one who stutters is happy to have this affliction, but a king who can't make a speech as his country is preparing for war is in serious trouble.)As with all historical dramas, we know the end of this one as soon as the movie begins. Still, the director works with his fine actors to make us care about the process of getting to where we know we will be as the credits start to roll. Definitely a film worth seeing. We saw it on the large screen, but it should work equally well on DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Beautiful,"This film always brings me to tears and I don't believe there will come a time when it doesn't. It was beautifully made and actually strives to show what it's like to have a speech impediment, especially when you need to speak publicly.

Surprisingly emotional historical drama,"Surprisingly compelling historical drama that beautifully blends emotion and inspiration. Colin Firth delivers a masterful performance as King George VI, who struggles with a debilitating speech impediment on the brink of World War II. His relationship with the unconventional speech therapist Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush, is both heartwarming and humorous, showcasing the power of friendship and perseverance. The film's cinematography captures the weight of royal expectations, while its poignant dialogue reveals the king's vulnerabilities. The subtle tension and eventual triumph during his pivotal speech resonate deeply, making it not just a film about speech but about finding one's voice in challenging times.

"Great lead performances by Firth, Rush, and Carter. Fabulous Film !!!","I just love everything about this movie. I came in expecting it to be slow, building up only to the climax of the king's final speech (that is the movie title, after all). But I was pleasantly surprised to find the web of growth and falls of his speech impediment, the complex family relationships, the struggles of the Duke becoming a King and his fluctuating relationship with his speech therapist. All the acting in this movie is outstanding, especially from Colin Firth himself. The cinematography is also subtle, mainly showing Colin in unusual camera angles and framing until the confident, classically framed shot of him at the end to represent his growth. This was a powerful though subtle use of cinematography. Something that goes unnoticed in the film until an almost shocking turnaround in the end. Well done in all ways.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
An unexpectedly great film,"Don't let the Royal Family subject matter put you off, The King's Speech isn't a flag waving feature espousing all things monarchy. At heart it's a much more personal story about one man's battle against a debilitating affliction. Colin Firth nails the part, and not just because he is able to stutter convincingly. Speech impediments are great material for actors trying to win acting awards but really the power of Firth's performance is in the way he presents a complex multi-dimensional character. The fact it is a real person makes it all the more tricky but he really pulls it off very well and it's not hard to see why he walked away with the big acting prizes this year. Of equal note is Geoffrey Rush as his speech therapist. He too is marvellous, and the chemistry between the two leads is terrific and really makes this a true acting master-class.The background detail also interested me. The way George VI's older brother was such an irresponsible waster was fascinating – indeed if you do any research on this character you'll see that the film lets him off lightly if anything. The atmosphere of impending war also nicely set a parallel with the king's increasing anxiety in his new public role. Overall, the period detail was very good and means that the film can also be appreciated as a historical film.The King's Speech is ultimately a feel-good film. But it's really a very high quality example of its type. It has great production values, top class acting and presents an interesting snap-shot of history. It would never have been a film that would normally have stood out to me but I'm pleased that the good notices it received made me check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Brilliant performances,"Colin Firth, Helena Bonham-Carter and Geoffrey Rush provide top performances in this moving portrayal of King George ""Bertie"" VI and his lifelong struggle with a stammer. The film also depicts his rise to the throne as he became ""the reluctant king"" on the eve of the Second World War. Firth was deserving of his Oscar win as King George, and Carter as his wife and Rush as his therapist were unlucky not to win Oscars for their supporting role. The chemistry between Firth and Rush is believable and is the film's highlight. It does a good job to avoid being overly sentimental and at the same time humanises an aristocrat. It strips a king down from a figurehead and pillar of strength and obedience to just another vulnerable and flawed human being. In fact, owing to his position, this is a man who is more vulnerable than the average person, and ""The King's Speech"" sets out to portray that and does its job superbly.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Technically sound,"'The King's Speech' is not dramatic or enjoys surprising twists. Audience can expect how the story will be told because of history, facts, and narrative style. The screenwriter wrote it straight-forward and neat. However the flow of the story is natural and smooth. It is organized, accurate, and filled with details.If the movie is all about the story, we can call this one just a good movie. However, strength of 'The King's Speech' is not the plot but acting, sound editing, and camera positioning.What enriches the simple and neat scenario is Colin Firth's acting. The main theme of the movie is King George VI's intense efforts to overcome stammer, and Firth definitely conveys improvement of speech over time gracefully. His agony of personal trauma from childhood and the responsibility of leading half of the world are well portrayed. Firth deserved Oscar for his performance.When King gives his first speech in Wembley Stadium, all the surrounding sounds such as footsteps when people stand up or dragging the chair are surreally loud, creating menacing and suppressed environment. At the same time, his own voice is overly amplified through microphone, creating echo of his sound too many times, making himself and the whole audience disconcerted. Additionally, when King reads a part of Hamlet in the first session, the loud music covers up his not-stuttering speech, but in the end, audience can clearly hear the whole 10 min speech with calming and quiet music in the background. This symbolizes increase in not only his eloquence but also his confidence. He is fully exposed auditorily in the movie and to the audience.Finally, Hooper's off-center shots of characters. This technique is more obvious at the start and lasts till about half of the movie, signifying unorganized and timid Bertie. He obviously refuses to be in the center, and it does not suit him personally, and the director tells viewers all these by where he positions camera. Space created by placing King on one side speaks to me that he has lots on his mind, pondering upon his personal history and royal duties. However, when King announces the war against Germany and encourages the people of UK at the end, his whole face is situated right at the center and microphone in front of him, very symmetrical. Also, the last scene at the balcony puts royal family at the center, indicating that he accepts his position as being in the center. Nuance and hints from camera position is subtle but smart and effective, exactly following the protagonist's psychological change.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Best film I have seen for ages. Don't miss it!,"I was lucky enough to see this wonderful film, having dragged two friends along as well. We all agreed it is the best film we have seen for ages. This deserves all the praise that it is getting, for this is truly a brilliant movie in every department. Story, acting, direction and production values.The story is very engaging right from the first scene and told in a brisk pace and laced with humor. The acting is terrific throughout, truly stunning and deserving of the acclaim they receive. Colin Firth is truly exceptional, and in his scenes in public with his stammer are excruciating to watch. Geoffery Rush matches him step for step as the unorthodox therapist and Helen Bonham Carter is excellent as usual. Guy Pearce and Timothy Spall act their parts incredibly well.There are plenty of films about the monarchy, but The King's Speech is more about the personal story of a man who reluctantly became King.So often films that receive the 'hype' such has 'The King's Speech' has done, you watch with anticipation, then wonder what all the fuss has been about, I can only say it surpassed all the expectations that I had. You do not need to have any particular thoughts, for, against or neutral in regards to the Royal Family to enjoy the film, it's that good it will captivate your attention from the off. l loved this movie and it has been an inspiration to many l am sure who suffer with the same impediment.

Amazing. Just amazing.,"""The King's speech"" is a wonderful example of a British film, based on a true story, and well-made. The characters of His Majesty King George the VIth and his family transferred greatly, and you will not even want to pause the film because it's more than interesting and tense. Although, in my opinion, the actor playing Sir Winston Churchill doesn't even look like him, it's just a small thing that doesn't really matters, because he shows up in the film only few times for a minute or two.

A jewel of a movie,"In one sense, this subject - the unexpected and (by him especially) unwanted accession to the throne of Prince Albert as King George VI - is an obvious choice for a British film for we love tales about the monarchy - think of ""Elizabeth"", ""Elizabeth: The Golden Age"", ""The Madness Of King George"", ""The Young Victoria, ""Mrs Brown"", ""The Queen"" ... On the other hand, an instance of extreme stammering would seem to be a most unsuitable subject for a medium which is all about fluency in both words and vision. Yet the outcome is a triumph.Considerable credit goes first to scriptwriter David Seidler who was attracted to the project as both a stammerer like the King and an Australian like his speech therapist. Director Tom Hooper - whose television mini-series ""John Adams"" I enjoyed so very much - has crafted a wonderful work that will bring special pride to his father whom I know professionally.Fresh from his superb performance in ""A Single Man"", Colin Firth provides a superlative portrayal of the psychologically damaged George, known to his family - and (impertinently) his speech therapist - as Bertie. While magnificent Aussie Geoffrey Rush was the one with the mental problems in ""Shine"", here he is the one with the (considerably unorthodox) response, therapist Lionel Logue who provides compensating techniques and much-needed friendship. Helena Bonham Carter is perfect as George's wife and (an Australian affecting a splendid English accent) Guy Pearce is ideal as George's brother.But this is a rare jewel of a movie - one with not a wasted or weak line of dialogue, one with not a less than accomplished and convincing piece of acting however small the role. There is plenty of humour and tenderness in a story that ends in a personal triumph: the speech at the end, which is one of the two allusions in the clever title, when you hang on every word as Beethoven belts out.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

"A private struggle, in the public eye","The Kings Speech, (2010), is an inspiring public sharing of a private struggle to triumph over an embarrassing impediment of royal proportion. This film is a telling account, that is respectfully and graciously presented, of Prince Albert, played by Colin Firth, who, second in line to succeed to the throne of his father, King George V, suffers privately from a noticeable case of stammering, which is publicly realized in 1925, upon stammering through a speech he delivers at Wembley Stadium on behalf of his father the King.Prince Albert's wife Elizabeth, played by Helena Bonham Carter, upon witnessing the public humiliation and embarrassment of her husband, and the unproven, and in her opinion uncredited, unestablished, and unwelcome exercises introduced by the Prince's current physician, which in one exercise required that Prince Albert insert 7 marbles into his mouth, and then read aloud from the pages of a given book, and to her and her husband's dismay, became angry when no words at all were able to be spoken, so this understandably infuriated the Prince, as he spewed the marbles from his mouth, and left the room in disgust, thus prompting Princess Elizabeth, to set out in an attempt to locate a highly recommended speech therapist, named Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush, and set up a visit to the royal home in hopes of treating and curing the Duke of York, of his stammering.The use of marbles by the current physician, immediately had me in fond remembrance of another film, which is, My Fair Lady, and the scene in remembrance is where Eliza Doolittle, played by Audrey Hepburn, benefiting from a bet made by her speech therapist, Professor Higgins, played by Rex Harrison, and his business associate, has been instructed to speak specifically rehearsed sentences with a mouth full of marbles, and she is so frustrated at the idea, especially because she is hungry, and exhausted from the days efforts, that she accidentally swallows one of the marbles. It was actually a lighthearted scene which was meant to receive a chuckle or two.In this film, Prince Albert, is faced with questions he not only does not want to face, but is pressed to confide in a man he considers to be inferior to his worth, and this seemed to fair just as challenging as treating the stammering itself. He fought to keep things private and untold, and he refused at first to be on first names with Lionel, who insisted on calling the Prince, Bertie, which is what the royal family and close friends called him. A very conducive friendship develops between Bertie and Lionel, which will create another of many challenges which will beset the Duke of York.The lighting and location for this film set the entire mood, and in combination with weather conditions such as fog and rain given to certain scenes, I felt sad, and gloomy, which in turn, I think gave rise to the ability or opportunity to manipulate the color scheme of this film into creating a depressed and defeated mood, and one of melancholy. The lighting accentuated the dreariness and drabness of rooms, and hallways, and made the air seem dense, and cold, and the actions and dialect, of the main characters through verbal and non-verbal expressions showed great continuity and coherence.I was impressed with the juxtaposition of a place as beautiful and majestic as Buckingham Palace, with gloriously painted ceilings, and warm, inviting colors of gold and red, and tremendous pieces of art and workmanship throughout, that there holds an ugliness, and disturbing disappointment of imperfection among the elegant, superior, flawlessly regal family who in the eyes of lay people, are the epitome of perfect, and that among the strongest of threads, there is weakness, and among the heads of morality, there are infractions. This film appeals to the optical and aural senses, with its pleasant royal dialect, and clever quips, and its emotional support of family, friends.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The King Says The 'F' Word,"'The King's Speech' is among the most refreshing period pieces of recent time. It can be described as a feel good film with some very interesting and relevant historical references. While it is feel-good, that doesn't diminish the historical importance of the story and how one relates to King George, not as a king but as another fellow human being like us who's facing his own struggles just like any one of us. The splendid writing, loaded with wit and humour, is absolutely fantastic.I liked that it wasn't one of those 'larger than life' period movies. Tom Hooper does a terrific job in toning down the look of 'The King's Speech'. While the sets and interiors are beautiful they are not overtly lavish and do not distract the viewer from the story. The cinematography is stunning. I particularly enjoyed the long shots that took place during the dialogues between the moving characters (as the camera follows them). The soundtrack too is used efficiently.Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush are at their best. The two actors excellently work off each other. Their scenes are a delight to watch. Firth gives his all to the role of the stammering King and Rush performs naturally. They are exceptionally supported by Helena Bonham Carter, Guy Pearce, Michael Gambon, Derek Jacobi and Jennifer Ehle.From start to finish, 'The King's Speech' is a treat to watch. Needless to say, it is one of the finest of the year.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
the voice against the wall,"This is more or less what i was expecting, for good and for bad, and that's now actually a very good complement. When i go to a movie, i always go with an open mind, expecting to be surprised.This is a film for and about actors from root to leaves. The main plot is about an unimportant man who has to learn how to act, in order to be convincing in front of an audience, and in order to disguise his stammerer condition. The device they use to show this is a common thing in drama: the personal quest of one man to overcome his handicap is mapped onto the collective aspirations of a group, in this case a nation on the verge of a war. So, by focusing on the personal drama of a number of people; the future king, his stammering brother, his wife, the voice coach; while being given a glimpse of what's going on in the world, the imminent conflict between uk and Germany, we are given the sensation that what will happen to the world depends on whether the king will be able to talk clearly to his people or not. It's an usual device, normally used in epics or war films. In this case i don't think that the ""speech"" is a strong enough alibi to make credible the whole story, but still i suppose it is OK as a dramatic device.Within that drama, the main point is the relation between the voice coach and the king. So, here it is a film about a friendship, a whole different genre on its own, that we've seen many times before. This gets interesting here, because the actors are apt, and the script helps. Colin Firth does fine, he has become a good actor, he knows how to merge into the fabric of the film and be a part of it. But Geoffrey Rush is something to watch, no matter what he does. He is a very fine actor, and his multiple layers of acting here are really interesting to watch: he acts an incredibly good voice coach, who hides his other side of a frustrated actor, constantly being rejected in theatre castings. He is able to correct the others' speeches, but not to deliver the lines convincingly enough. He transports his undelivered performance to the king, and projects his frustration as an actor unable to convince an audience to the success of the king as he convincingly incites his nation into resistance. Radio is the chosen medium, and it is perfect for this plot because its magic resides uniquely on the words, and how they're delivered.Oh and there is an element that comes fromThere is one very interesting set, worth mentioning: Rush's office. The environment is fine, the old furniture, gadgets of those days, the turntable, the mic, etc. But what is really well picked is the texture of the wall behind the patient's couch. All those multi colored dots, placed on the background of a face fighting to overcome his difficulty. The wall has great visual power, and supports the drama well enough. I enjoyed it.My opinion: 3/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Brought tears to my eyes,..","I will keep this short. I suffered from a pronounced stammer when I was young. As I got older in age, the stammer has become less and less pronounced. I still stammer when i am angry or in situations that are unexpected. People can be cruel,which is why i closely identify to this movie. I could not imagine in a millions years to hold a conversation,let alone hold a normal conversation, when my stammer was at its worst. This man not only gave a speech, but uplifted a nation's spirit with a delivery and diction that was simply inspiring. Verbal stammering is a paralyzing impediment, often having many of its victims in fear of just saying simple words or sentences, then portraying to the world our horrible defect. When I was young i was in constant fear, which is why this movie means so much to me. I am sure that when I state that King George VI of Britain was a great man of incredible courage and diligence,there will be many with my disability,that will agree whole heartedly.God Bless you King George VI,as well as all that created this wonderful film.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A good story. And more.,"Without definition. That is my conclusion. A film with moral drops and historical spices , with a great cast but in final, only a labyrinth. Warm and seductive but not just a tea cup. Elegant and simple but lovely for deep causes. A delicate show but very strange. A king and his teacher. Shadows of crisis.And a lot of victories. For me, it is a fine embroidery. Old figures and few natural seams. Nothing complicated. But every gesture mathematical precise.The surprise is Colin Firth. Geoffrey Rush is the same - chameleon and slippery. Bonham Carter is secondary piece for a huge cake. But Firth is really impressive in this tall for ordinary people who discovers not a game with kings and dragons but a basic crisis and a small answer to daily fear. For that motive, it is not a film for Oscar or a moralistic speech.It is a voice who must be more than a drop of wind.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Why you should and shouldn't see The King's Speech,"The Story Once upon a time a boy was found in the womb of Queen Victoria earlier than any other babies possessing male genitalia, giving him the authority to rule Great Britain as Edward VII. The son of Edward VII who was born first reigned as George V, although by this time the King wasn't really expected to rule anything, just to hold still for a little bit so someone could draw a portrait to be printed on the money; surround himself with precious objects and loyal subjects; and make speeches. (If this puzzles you, here is a clear discussion of the Divine Right that serves as foundation to any monarchy.)This brings us to the beginning of the film, where I switch to the present tense. George V's son Prince Albert (Firth) hasn't been George V's son quite as long as his brother David, but David is a playboy and considered something of a flake, and at any rate, being even the second son of a king makes one very important, requiring public appearances. Surprisingly Prince Albert doesn't need to know about things and write speeches about the things he knows--they have people for that--but the Empire depends on him, as it depends on his dad (and as the United States depends on its Presidents), to recite profound words and pretend that they are his. Big problem: the Prince stammers terribly. He's seen several experts about it and has given up, but his wife Elizabeth (Bonham Carter) wants him to try a London speech therapist whose last name is actually a suffix meaning ""speech."" He reluctantly goes to see Lionel Logue (Rush), who insists on being in charge within the confines of their professional relationship, even going so far as to call the Prince ""Bertie.""What I think Colin Firth stammers wonderfully, and the Albert/King George VI on screen is a buckling vessel pumped so close to the point of rupture with frustration and fear, poetically revealed by David Seidler's script, that we feel deeply for him. Geoffrey Rush is believable and entertaining as a man who respects royalty and yet stands up to it for the sake of his royal client, and who cares not at all if his methods appear silly, because he knows they work. His main task, though, is to convince Bertie to forgive his own vulnerability, allowing him to embrace his own strength.Why you should see it: You like things that are good. You'll feel all cultured and whatnot if you see an Oscar© winner in which everyone has an English accent. You want to justify your purchase of three dozen ""Wormtail for Prime Minister"" bumper stickers.Why you shouldn't see it: You despise things that are good, because they encourage the sin of Pride and inspire admiration, which leads to more pride, leading to more achievement, making for a never-ending cycle of ""la dee da, look at me and the various and sundry good things I bring to the world because I'm such a big fricking deal."" You speak only the Twi dialect of Akan, you don't like subtitles and you're fairly certain The King's Speech is not yet dubbed in Twi.

Unjust,"The film did not do justice to the person of the duke of Windsor.He was not such a wimpy toy boy as portrayed in the role played by a person totally unsuitable for it.The mere suggestion that he could be manipulated and forced to make decisions in haste and without weighing the pros and cons contradicts the facts of history..He was raised in Queen Victori's lap and had been raised by three generations of royals, groomed to be The King and Emperor.Destiny took a different course...matters of heart ! but he was no liar.His abdication was a tragedy....and a loss!One of the reasons for this apparently biased characterization maybe the presence of the generation that had suffered the dreadful tortures of WW2 and somehow link the person and actions of the British monarch to the events that followed his abdication.But,I think we cant make a single person the scapegoat for the mistakes of so many and for so long.I respect the man, his politics is none of my business, I admire his courage and truthfulness.He might get his rightful place in history sometime in future,Amen.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
The king's Speech,"The story is about George VI who is the son of later King Edward VII. He is abused by a wet nurse and has a complex about stuttering. Though he is bring up in comfortable circumstances, he doesn't have any confidence in herself and he is too shy to speak in public. However, his strict father doesn't such the son, and he gives his son orders to speak speeches of ceremonies without mercy. One day, George VI's wife takes Lionel to George VI's. Lionel has not a medical license and dreams of becoming an actor. Lionel insists that we are equal in a consultation room. He is forced the King to give up smoking. By using the way of Lionel, he conquers stuttering and tries to work out his lessons.The film has dialogue and colors. The genre of the movie is biography and drama. It is based on a true story. I think the film can have encouraged people who suffer from stuttering.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A Great King,"This is story about George Ⅵ. He has a stammer and has been troubled since he was a child. Therefore he doesn't want to be the king. However, he has to be the king because his brother withdraws the crown. Then he begins to train for speech with Lionel who doesn't have a medical license.The scene which they practice is so funny. I laughed out loud. The method of training is unique and it is amusing the attitude of Lionel that doesn't flinch at the king. His wife, the queen, is strong. I think just she is the wife of the king. He is lucky that has marvelous wife. Certainly, king have to be perfect man. Because king is object of worship of the nation. However, even king may have shortcoming. Of course, it is common people have fault. But it is hard for a king of a nation. The king of the film is great and the nation will be sure to love him even if he has a stammer.This film's time is World War Ⅱ. Therefore I could watch the story during the war in detail. It is also interesting for me.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Breathtaking,"Wow. Just wow. I can't put my finger on it but, that was the single best movie I have ever seen. It puts all other movies in the dust. If there is one movie you have to see before you die, it's The King's Speech. It wasn't a funny movie, but when there was a joke it was pretty funny. Character development people, character development. I made the movie. I didn't like Queen Elizabeth very much, she seemed too uptight and snooty in the movie, although I was happy that she supported her husband through his journey. I was holding my breath throughout the speech. I have never liked historical movies, but this one blew me away.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Good,"I was happy finished watching it! King George VI is Stammering symptom when he was a child. He was suffered from it. He was examined many type of doctors however his symptom didn't improve at all. One day his wife Elizabeth found a doctor who is a little strange. His name is Lioel. She decided to see him here and introduced her to King George. He is so stubborn and he persisted in his pride. So he gave up soon but doctor never gave up. Then he noticed his symptom getting recover more and more. He was training in his doctor hard,he succeeded to his speech finally. He became the symbol of Disobedience movement and King and doctor's friendship continued. I was touched when King George succeeded to his speech.There were many difficulties on his way to success. This story is based on a true story so it's really good.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Good film!,"I give it a solid 7.Masterful performancesStorywise widely disseminated.The King at first, he can't trust the doctor. But after the King talk about his circumstances in family to the doctor, they get along with each other gradually. In this movie, his effort is great. He often seems to be sad, but he goes on the training with the doctor. At last, he makes a good speech.The doctor looks at the speech. I was impressed to hear the speech. His speech is perfect and strong. The public give a big hand. When the speech ends his face turns bright. The process of his overcoming stuttering is performed very well. His fine changes in his face make the movie more attractive. I felt importance of friends. If the doctor wasn't with him, he might not change. They trust each other, so that they result in success. I was impressed by acting ability of both actors.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"An impeccable British film for audiences across the pond, too.","The King's Speech is the type of film that wins awards, despite what mass audiences may think of it. It is beautifully made, almost without any blemish at all. The acting is beyond superb; Colin Firth must and will win the Best Actor Oscar in a brilliantly ironic performance where he succeeds at being unable to talk. This performance goes beyond simply getting down the patterns of King George's stammer; it is detailed and calculated for every scene to create a stunning portrayal of a man afraid of his duty to his country but brave enough to attempt it, unlike his brother. Helena Bonham Carter also deserves great recognition for her small but important role as George's wife, a pleasant woman who fiercely loves her husband and is willing to do anything to help him. Yet, perhaps the best and most overlooked performance is that of Geoffrey Rush as Lionel Logue, a rather unorthodox speech therapist whose unequivocal mannerisms and treatment of George as simply another patient stir up in the nervous monarch the courage and determination to defeat his setbacks.All accolades aside, this is an interesting film to approach. It is being hailed by many as one of the best films of 2010 along with The Social Network. In many ways, they share similar themes and ideas. Both are about the power of communication and language. Each focuses on one individual attempting to change their methods of connecting with others, though for very different reasons. The most interesting difference between the two films is how they are made and the style and substance each possesses. The King's Speech is a glorious British period piece, focusing on the commoner's favorite topic: royalty, methodically paced and wonderfully made with excellent acting, stunning sets, minimalistic direction and a tasteful and witty script. By contrast, The Social Network hurdles at a pace rarely seen by films today that don't include an action sequence. The speech is biting, cunning, cynical and is thrown at the audience so quickly it bears a second viewing just to understand all the great lines.So, the question everyone will ask on February 27 is which film will walk away with the most Oscars? In thinking about that question, having seen and greatly admired both films, perhaps it is best to not care what the Academy thinks and appreciate each film on its own merit. Each has a different story, style and audience in mind and for those goals they pass with flying colors. In a way, this is the kind of film that destroys the rigid thinking of such awards and presentations. I am sure that the actors, writers, director and other cast and crew on each film did not make their respective works in hopes of winning the little golden statue. They did so because they believed in the material and were willing to do their best to ensure it was the best viewing experience possible.With these thoughts in mind, I will watch the Oscars ceremony, not worried about which film will win the coveted Best Picture. Rather, I will attempt to appreciate each work for what it is: a crowning achievement for all involved and a depiction of the power and influence speech and communication can have. Whether you're a WWII-era Brit or a modern-day American with a Facebook account, it's easy to see that these films are great examples of how to make an organic, exciting and moving story.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
"Empathy, so much empathy","Two things which lured me to the theater were the cast and the genre: the rare case of a biography with the elements of comedy, my top favorite among comedies. Two things that made the movie memorable were the reconstruction of the time period with a rather modern insight and the close bond with the main character, it really felt like being there and then.This movie is a touching drama with a lovely humor, but can be a really scary catastrophe thriller for anyone who has any kind of speech impediment, stage fright or other problem with public speaking. The emotions you get before an exam or a public presentation will be back on you in the theater. Oh, the horror! Bertie, do you want a hug?I really appreciate how the main characters were portrayed; it was easy to see their strong and weak points, their fears and ambitions. Helena Bonham Carter was the Dutchess/Queen with class but also with nerve, and the two leading actors created a warm and strong married couple. Geoffrey Rush showed us Lionel Logue as a clever man with the greatest empathy, who was also very much ahead of his era with the approach to the therapy.It was interesting to see the society in which mass media, public relations and personal life coaches would seem much of a novelty, but apparently it was already coming. I liked the way the movie showed good and bad sides of monarchy, both for the members of the royal family and for the nation (er... Empire).It was a memorable movie certainly worth watching even if due to the emotional bond with King George it makes you feel like having a cigarette, pronouncing random dirty words and becoming a Colin Firth fan-girl forever more.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Poignant and exciting,"This past year's Academy Award winner for Best Picture, The King's Speech, looked to me like another boring exercise in British stuffiness. I was wrong. I don't think that there has ever been another film about the British royal family that has been as intimate and emotionally absorbing. For once, the royals were portrayed as human beings. Even 2006's The Queen, featuring Helen Mirren's portrayal of the current queen, for which she won Best Actress, felt to me like a cold and distant portrayal of an inhuman old woman cut off from the world. Colin Firth's depiction of King George VI (the current queen's father) was incredibly poignant, and it earned him a hugely deserved Oscar for Best Actor.

Rush and Firth are just sublime,"Let's be honest, if a writer was to pitch an idea of a film about a man with a stammer it would more than likely be rejected flat. Not much of a conflict for a man with a speech impediment other than struggling to fit a one minute sentence into, well one minute. Therefore I believe this film was only really made due to the fact that our King at the time of war had a stammer and was needed to speak to fill the nation with confidence. I suppose now you can suggest a little conflict.The film follows the Duke of York, Prince Albert (Firth). After failing to deliver a speech at Wembley Stadium his wife Elizabeth (Carter) decides to find a man who can treat her husband. After struggling with several speech therapists, Elizabeth enlists the help of Lionel Logue (Rush), an Australian actor who helps people with stammers. The story then follows Albert and Lionel's relationship along with Albert's rise to the thrown through the death of his father and the abdication of his brother, who was more interested in women then leading his country. The story shows the arrival of King George VI. The father of our now Queen Elizabeth. Reluctant to take the thrown but knowing he must the King must now try harder to solve his speech problem, especially with Hitler rising and war with Germany is beckoning.The plot of the film is weak but seeing as it is true British history we will let that slip. Also because the film isn't based around plot but around the characters involved. Let me just say the acting in this film is fantastic. Firth is so acceptable as a man struggling for words and will have you believing that in fact he is a man with a stammer. Rush is out of this world as the cocky therapist whose controversial methods must help the King. He's a man filled with wit and fearful of going deeper into someone who he should not treat as equal but does. Bonham Carter is also good as Queen Elizabeth and her chemistry with Firth feels real. In fact when these three are on screen the film really is something. The dialogue just bounces between Firth and Rush as if it was an actual conversation and not coming from a script. The lines also deliver humour and bring a light hearted feel to a part of history that is so pivotal to us Brits. Sadly though as the chemistry is so good the film slows slightly especially when Rush isn't on the screen.The film also holds several cameos coming from Guy Pearce as Albert's brother Edward, Michael Gambon as their father, King George V and Timothy Spall as Winston Churchill. All delivering good performances all round.The film delivers some lovely scenes and this is thanks to the fantastic direction. Shots are used here that won't be seen in many other films and the cinematography is so good that many of the shots involve more background than actors. Several shots having one actor in the bottom corners of the screen and the rest just being a multi coloured wall. The script is also brilliant with every bit of dialogue top notch. Like I said before the dialogue between King and teacher flows brilliantly. The script has the two as if the King is in fact a school child with Logue giving the King privileges if he participates in a task. Something a man with Royal power would never normally adhere to. One of Firth's speeches to Rush actually states that he always wondered what it would be like to know the ordinary man and to even have friends. Logue's character fits into both these aspects and helps this King to acquire the confidence he needs.The film is very very good but I feel it is only at its best when the two leads are on screen, especially Rush. When he is not on I felt myself not as interested especially as the plot is overall only about a man with a stammer. I believe the film may not have been such a big success as it has been if it wasn't about the King but having said that it is still at the top of its genre.I advise everyone to watch this. See how brilliant true acting can be and if you don't really like the film you will come out having learnt something about an important part of our history.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
A real masterpiece!,"A superb production! Outstanding performances of Colin Firth as King George VI, Geoffrey Rush as the Australian therapist Lionel Logue, Helena Bonham Carter as Queen Elizabeth and even Guy Pearce as King Edward VIII. The first wartime speech of King George VI heard at the sound of Beethoven's Piano Concerto No 5, Op. 73 ('Emperor'), is simply one of the most glorious moments of the so called seventh art in all times. No doubt, The King's Speech is the best film I have ever seen during the last ten years. I think this film deserved all Oscars he won and it tells us a wonderful and inspiring story which delivers the triumph of the most important values we need to preserve in our lives.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Watch it for Colin Firth and Geoffery Rush,The King's Speech: I dreaded that this movie would be really serious boring and predictable. But I was surprised to find that it had its comedic moments and little surprises thrown with the beautiful background and architecture of the British Empire. Colin Firth gives an Oscar winning performance .It was good to see Helena Bonham Carter playing a normal person and not one of the weirdos for a change who cares about her husband and has a quiet self-assurance that in the end he would come out triumphs. The life of the movie is actually Geoffrey Rush who is given the tough job of a guy who confidently steers stammers/people with speech problems to confident speakers and pulls it off with dignified grace given the surprising background lurking in his past sprung suddenly on the audience. It's so nice to know that there are people who go back to history and dig out stories of strength and vulnerabilities of historical or royal figures. Watching 4-5 movies a week feels like reading 5 books of entirely different topics and is a really fulfilling experience for me.,,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
Choice of music?,"Masterpiece theatreish movies aren't my cup of (very British) tea, so I don't find much interesting about the movie with a couple of exceptions, and I will leave it to others to gush with praise. Of course the performances are fine (those British can act) and it was a treat to see Claire Bloom again, if only briefly (and even if I didn't recognize her at all). It struck me odd that the future king, who was surely reared better, would act so ungentlemanly toward Logue, even if the latter certainly takes social liberties. Does noblesse no longer oblige? But I was particularly surprised at the choice of (mostly) background music, especially at the climactic point of the big speech about Britain going to war with Germany. I wonder why they chose all German music (slow movement of Beethoven's 7th symphony and slow movement of Beethoven's 5th (""Emperor"") piano concerto. Surely it isn't explained by the German blood in the royal family. Surely they could have found some rousing music by British composers.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
This is the best movie,"This story based on a man becoming King George Ⅵ of the UK. From this film we can learn the history of the UK. He has difficulty to speak in front of many people so he trains how to speak. The way to practice is very unique, funny and stupid. King George Ⅵ has big pride so he is above practice speaking in such a stupid way. During establishing a relationship of trust between him and his speaking teacher, he can speak and he can swallow his stubborn pride. This film is a bit serious but thanks to funny training scene this film is not so heavy. I cannot stop laughing when I watch funny practice scene. I love costumes of this film. These costumes have a meticulous attention to detail so these are very gorgeous and beautiful. Ironically, the end of this film is a speech of the starting WWⅡ. I feel complicate of this end.

Deep friendship is developed in an unlikely situation.,"This film is about the true story of King George VI. He was known most of his young adult life as His Highness Prince Albert of York (Colin Firth). He became the king when his brother King Edward VIII (Guy Pearce) relinquishes the throne. Prince Albert of York becomes King George VI, the new king of England. King George VI (Colin Firth) had developed a stuttering problem at age four, and he continued to struggle with the problem in his adult life. He seeks several ways to fix his personal flaw, but none of them are successful. Growing concerned about her husband's vocal handicap, Queen Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) seeks out Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush). Lionel is a speech therapist that pushes Bertie (King George's nick name) to deal with the causes of his speaking issues.The theme is clearly about finding a friend in the least likely place. Lionel is not in the same class of people as Bertie, he is just an ordinary working family man. Lionel grows to care deeply about Bertie and helps him to deal with the physical challenges of public speaking. This was done through support, encouragement, physical activity, and speech exercises. Additionally, Lionel applied a constant pressure on Bertie which pushes him into a corner and forces him to either fight his way out or cower in the corner.One element the director used lighting to depict the difference between the King's lush living quarters and the Lionel's modest accommodations. At the royal home, it was bright and clean looking. At the Logue residence, the lighting was low, it was decorated in dark colors and the film quality seemed to have a haze.The director also used camera angles and sound effects to intensify the scenes where the King froze up while attempting to deliver a speech. The camera would zoom into Bertie's face to get the overall look of stress and then zoom closer to see the Bertie's mouth struggling to get the words out. Sound effects to mimic the facial expressions of the king were applied to make the King seem more believable. These elements would make the audience feel like and active participants.The film Lost in Translation has a similar theme. Bob Harris (Bill Murray) is in Tokyo on business. Bob is lonely, bored, and seems to stick out like a sore thumb in Tokyo. Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson) is staying at the same hotel as Bob. Charlotte's husband (Giovanni Ribisi) leaves his wife at the hotel while he travels away on business. Charlotte finds herself bored, lonely, and unclear about her life in general. Bob and Charlotte meet and develop a close friendship that hints to becoming a bit more.In both films a deep friendship is developed in an unlikely situation. These friendships were developed throughout each film and each came with its own set of complications. However, in the end, the benefits out weigh the difficulty",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"

Unique and inspiring,"I think that Tom Hooper's The King's Speech is unlike any other movie ever produced. Some people get bored with historical movies but it is impossible to get sick of this one. This flick is not the typical Hollywood film with the typical happy ending either. Instead this film takes you on a ride through time, exposing a British King's life. The movie begins with King George VI, played by Colin Firth, nervously awaiting the speaking platform for the closing speech of the Empire Exhibition in Wembly, England. He stands thee vulnerable, exposed, and embarrassed, as he stutters through the entire speech. I think that this role is one of Colin Firth's best. Right off the bat Colin draws you in. You automatically feel for his character. His stammer is so believable! Colin allows you to walk in the King's shoes, having the entire world listen to him stutter through every speech. I experienced a roller-coaster of emotions watching this film. In the beginning King George's arrogance and unwillingness to cooperate made me feel extremely frustrated. As he begins to trust himself and his new speech therapist, Mr. Lionel Logue, played by Geoffrey Rush, it's impossible not to feel reassured as an audience member. Lionel works his magic by giving King George confidence and something he has never had, a genuine friend. Director Tom Hooper deserves a round of applause for the well rounded, historically accurate plot. He uncovers many sides to King George and describes the events, both public and private, that made him who he was. Hooper shows us the meaning of friendship, family, perseverance, trust and most importantly overcoming adversity. This movie is for all ages young and old. I think that the actors and makers of this film deserve every Oscar and Academy Award given to them. I give The King's Speech a standing ovation.",,Anonymous,"Biography, Drama, History"
