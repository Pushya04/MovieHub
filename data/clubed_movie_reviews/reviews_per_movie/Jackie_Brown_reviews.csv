Booyah!,"Coming as it did after critical darlings ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", it's perhaps not surprising that Quentin Tarantino's next film failed to - at the time - scale those giddy heights. Yet on reflection these days, when viewing Tarantino's career over twenty years later, it's one of his tightest works.Working from master pulper Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch"", Tarantino had a concrete base from which to build on, which he does with aplomb. Cleaving close to the spirit of Leonard, ""Jackie Brown"" is rich with glorious chatter, each conversation either pings with a biting hard ass edge, or alternatively deconstructing the vagaries of the human condition.Oh for sure this is a talky pic, but nothing is ever twee or pointless, for it's a film that pays rich rewards to those prepared to fully grasp the characters on show, to be aware that all is building towards the final third. It's then here where the story brings about its stings, with a complex operation cloaked in double crosses and evasive captures, of violence and more...There's a wonderful portion of the story that sees Tarantino play the same sequence out from different character perspectives, but this is not self indulgency. Tarantino reins himself in, not letting stylisations detract from the characters we are so heavily involved with. His other triumph is bringing Pam Grier and Robert Forster to the fore, who both deliver terrific performances. It's through these pair, with their deft characterisations, where Jackie Brown is most poignant and purposeful.Is it a case of ""Jackie Brown"" being undervalued in Tarantino's armoury? Perhaps it is? For it's ageless, holding up as a piece of intelligent work of note, and well worth revisiting by anyone who hasn't seen it since it was first released. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Solid film, never a dull moment, great characters","Although different than some of Tarantino's more violent precursors,  such as ""Reservoir Dogs"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""True Romance"" this is an excellent film. Where it lacks in violence however, the film makes up for in language earning it an ""R"" rating in the US. In certain scenes, I thought it Tarantino went to far with the explicit language and it seemed awkward and artificial, but that does not cast a shadow of over what I thought was an otherwise fantastic film. The editing and directing is excellent. There is good character development of the main characters, yet there is not one scene where the movie drags throughout its entire 150 minutes. I couldn't tear myself away from this movie until the very end.Especially enjoyable is the performance by Robert Forster whose character I thought was outstanding. Max Cherry, played by Forster, is a tempered bail bondsman who cautiously handles his unscrupulous clients. One day he is approached by Ordell Robbie, played by Samuel L. Jackson, to post a bond for Jackie Brown, a middle aged flight attendant for a low cost airline who gets caught smuggling Ordell's fortune in Mexico into the US. The initial meeting between Jackie and Max sets up a relationship between these two characters on both professional and personal level and that changes Max from a methodical and business man to almost an innocent young boy with a crush. The last scene in the movie between these two characters is absolutely brilliant.I highly recommend this film and it's fun to watch Tarantino mature as a director. The little extras littered throughout the film such as ""Chick with Guns"", the fabulous locations such as the Cockatoo Inn, and the excellent characters make this film well worth a view.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of my favorite Tarantino movies,"Jackie Brown is considered by many (myself included) to be one of Quentin Tarantino's best films and also one of his most under-appreciated. There's love for it but it isn't met with the same reverence as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, or the same enthusiasm as his genre homages that followed. But it should be more widely praised as it's an exceptional movie. The direction is wonderful, the soundtrack is fun, and the script is full of memorable dialogue, as you would expect from Tarantino. The cast is terrific, led by '70s legend Pam Grier in her ""comeback"" role and Robert Forster in an understated performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar nomination. Every scene with Grier and Forster, separately or together, is a treat. As fun as Sam Jackson is, these two are what hold the film together and make it so enjoyable to watch over and over. For his part, Jackson does what you expect him to do. He's foul-mouthed and funny but still very menacing when he needs to be. Robert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda both offer amusing support. Chris Tucker has a brief but funny appearance. The movie has a lot of humor. That's one of the main things that makes it so enjoyable to watch over and over. It's a great film that probably holds more appeal to non-Tarantino fans than most of his movies do.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino's sleeper. An underrated gem of a movie.,"Many people were disappointed with 'Jackie Brown' when it was first released as it didn't live up to their expectations created by the more flamboyant 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. I admit that I was one of those disappointed fans. But as the years have gone by I have come to appreciate this movie more and more, and if you deal with what it IS and not what you thought it was going to be, you'll see that it is an underrated gem of a movie. 'Jackie Brown' is much more character driven and leisurely plotted than Tarantino's previous two movies. I haven't read the Elmore Leonard novel on which it was based so I can't tell whether this was a conscious decision by Tarantino himself, or it's because of the source material, but it might be a stumbling block for those with MTV-style attention spans. 1970s crime movie buffs will find it much easier going. The big names in the cast like De Niro, Jackson and Fonda are all very good, but the real standout performances in this movie are by 70s blaxploitation icon Pam Grier ('Coffy', 'Foxy Brown', 'Black Mama White Mama',etc.etc.) and a revelatory one from Robert Forster. Forster back in the day showed plenty of promise in movies like 'Medium Cool' but quickly found himself stuck in b-grade exploitation movies like 'Vigilante' and 'Alligator'. Fun stuff, but hardly Oscar material. Max Cherry is the best role he has ever been given, and he is superb in it. The fascinating thing about 'Jackie Brown' for me is that Tarantino's critics accuse him of making shallow and violent self-consciously hip crime films, but the central story of this movie concerns an inter-racial Middle Aged romance, something I haven't seen done in a believable or realistic fashion by Hollywood before. By doing this so well Tarantino shows he has much more depth, and is a much more interesting and braver film maker than his more acclaimed contemporaries. 'Jackie Brown' is a fine movie that hopefully one day will get the kudos it deserves. Don't overlook this one just because it isn't 'Pulp Fiction The Next Generation'!",,Anonymous,Crime
"Personally, I find it to be Quentin Tarantino's Masterpiece","Sometimes a movie requires more than one viewing. The first time I sat down to watch Jackie Brown, I wasn't so impressed. I didn't hate the movie, but I didn't love it either. I thought it was decent. The second time I watched it, I knew the plot already so I really got to indulge in the characters of the film. And thats exactly what the film is, it's a character piece.Those of you who expect an energetic, stylized, violent, comic book-esque film like Pulp Fiction will not get that from this movie. Its a lot more tamed, and to say the least realistic. I love Pulp Fiction, its one of my all time favorite movies. But I doubt in the real world there would be two hit men in matching black and white suits. The scenarios of that movie, while fun and totally entertaining, aren't too realistic. Jackie Brown on the other hand has totally real characters that don't come off as too over the top.All the actors in the movie are superb.The lead is played by actress Pam Grier who nails the role. Tarantino again shows you don't need an a-list actor to carry a movie. Grier plays Jackie Brown, an airline stuartess in her 40s. Samuel L. Jackson plays Ordell Robbie, a gun dealer who uses Jackie to bring him in money from Mexico. Robert DeNiro (in a smaller role for such a big actor) plays Louis, Ordell's friend who recent got out of jail. Bridget Fonda plays Melanie, a ""blonde haired surfer girl"" who lives with Ordell. Michael Keaton (my all time favorite actor)plays ATF agent Ray Nicollette who wants to take down Ordell. And Robert Forster plays Max Cherry, a bail bonds man. Without giving too much away, all of these characters in one way or another are all after $500,000 of Ordell's money. Every character in this movie is great and unique in their own way. But for me, Robert Forster steals the show. Max Cherry is without a doubt my favorite character in all of Quentin Tarantino's movies.To some people, this movie is just a crime/heist movie. But to me there is something quite beautiful to this movie. After a few viewings of the film, you will notice that underneath it all, this movie is really about two people. Jackie Brown and Max Cherry. Two people who are middle aged, lonely, and tired of their dead end jobs. Two people that meet in a very unlikely way. Two people that together figure out a way to steal $500,000 and get away with it. Take this movie however you want it. But to me, thats the heart of the movie, and thats why the movie works so well.In conclusion, Jackie Brown is not a graphic crime story like Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction that preceded it. Nor is it a stylized revenge saga like Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2 that followed it. Instead it is a stand alone film. A wonderfully acted character study. And for me, an absolute gem of a film. It's Quentin Tarantino's underrated MASTERPIECE.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pam Grier!,"What a film! Amazing ensemble, serpentine plot, all based on an Elmore Leonard novel. I enjoyed the film when it first came out but I didn't appreciate its complexity and the caliber of its acting as I did when I saw it the other day.A tired airline stewardess (Pam Grier as the eponymous character) sees a slim window through which she could escape to a more leisurely life. However, she will have to steal money from a nasty small-time arms dealer and convince the Feds she is trying to help them get the dealer. Can she make it work? On her side is bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) who, we think, might want to squeeze out that window with her.However, she has to outwit the venal Ordell Robbie (Sam Jackson) who we see is not the nicest guy in the world. Robbie is assisted by the dim-witted pothead ex-con Louis (Robert DeNiro) and his possibly-smarter-than-she-looks snow bunny Melanie (Bridge Fonda).On the other is the law, in the person of Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) and Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton). She has to convince the Feds she is complying with the terms of her agreement with them and she has to convince Ordell that she is not scamming him. It's a hell of a balance. Can she do it?Great music, typically a-bit-too-clever dialogue as one might expect from Tarantino. Tarantino features LA's grittiness in a way that those of us Angelenos who know that the Southland isn't all Beverly Hills and Hollywood really appreciate. The acting is fantastic. You've never seen Robert DeNiro act like this. He's dopey with a lot of repressed anger. DeNiro gets the essence of a conflicted ex-con. Robert Forster is competent and confident. The chemistry he has with Grier is smoldering. Sam Jackson eats up the screen in his scenes. It's like shooting fish in a barrel for him.Pam Grier is phenomenal as Jackie Brown. You don't know just how honest Jackie is but you have sympathy for her from the get-go. Grier makes her gorgeous, smart, hard-working, sexy, confident, and diligent. It really is a shame that she hasn't had another role even APPROACHING one of this richness. It truly is a great role though and Pam Grier delivers in spades.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The forgotten one,"Out of all the films in Tarantino's career as director, JACKIE BROWN is the one people are least likely to have seen. This may be because it's the director's most subtle and relaxed movie, and also the only one in which the material he directs isn't his own; instead this is an adaptation of an Elmore Leonard novel. This doesn't mean it's at all bad, and in actual fact it's entertaining to watch Tarantino try something different for a change.Of course, his trademarks are still apparent for the fans. The dialogue is as zippy and frenetic as ever, and the characters the usual bunch of double-crossing low-lifes you'd expect to see in RESERVOIR DOGS and PULP FICTION. There's a huge set-piece late on in which takes place in a shopping mall that manages to be just as entertaining as the chop-em-up showdown of KILL BILL: VOLUME 1 even if the on-screen events are more laid back.As with every other Tarantino movie I've seen (all of 'em, with the exception of DEATH PROOF), the cast is remarkable for its breadth and daring. Once again, Tarantino isn't afraid to pick forgotten or non A-list types as central characters. When he incorporates A-listers, like De Niro here, he does an about turn and casts them against type. It pays off. De Niro is hilarious as a no-good hoodlum and seems to be loving the chance to play something other than a slick mob boss.Elsewhere, we get cult favourite Robert Forster (ALLIGATOR) who gives what I think is his best ever performance; Michael Keaton, playing a pretty weird/wired cop; Bridget Fonda as a stoner; Chris Tucker, not annoying for once; Samuel L. Jackson as a cold-blooded, almost reptilian character and, of course, Pam Grier. While I appreciate Grier's iconic status - I've seen a fair few of the '70s flicks that made her famous - I don't think she's quite the actress that Tarantino hoped for when casting her, but she's adequate at least. Add in a Sid Haig cameo and there you have it: a typically offbeat, original and enjoyable Tarantino outing with a cast to die for.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
No Fancy Fireworks needed,"Contrary to Pulp Fiction which had a very unusual editing and flashy situations, Jackie Brown focuses more on characters that are basically humans with very focused problems, for instance getting older which is an eminent theme tackled in the film. No one's evil in all this. They all have interestingly real personalities and I felt strangely comfortable watching them talk, eat, kill and argue with each other. Tarantino is an excellent storyteller and I wish I could write dialogues as interesting as his. The film flows with a slower pace than Pulp, with all it's many streched takes and lenghty scenes, but by doing so leaves us more time to grasp the characters with all their differences. A more mature Tarantino. Still loving what he does. And he said it himself before the film came out: ""This one is at a lower volume then 'Pulp.' It's not an epic, it's not an opera. It's a character study.""",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Authentic and well acted but it drags on for far too long,"Quentin Tarantino is a man between genius and madness who has created some of the best movies ever but also a few true Fails in my opinion. ""Jackie Brown"" is just between both extremes for me and is maybe his most unspectacular film to date.On the positive side, this movie is Tarantino's most organic one until now. The characters are more credible than usual, the dialogues aren't all too over the top and the story line is quite easy to follow. The movie includes no special effects, shock moments or unexpected twists and feels surprisingly down to earth for a Quentin Tarantino movie. From that point of view, it's a quite unique movie from him. The acting is authentic and very well done. Pam Grier plays an attractive and intelligent lady in her forties who starts the movie as a victim just to become the one who plays with each other character around her. Samuel L. Jackson does a convincing role as superficial but not dumb gangster. Robert Forster plays a bondsman and smart gentleman with a lot of charisma as well. He's the actor I somehow like the most in this movie. In addition to the movie's authentic mood and the great acting, the soundtrack is as always quite convincing as well and introduces us to many great Afroamerican musicians. I must though admit that I preferred by far the soundtracks of other Tarantino movies such as ""Kill Bill"" or ""Django Unchained"" for example.On the other side, the movie definitely has its lengths as many Tarantino movies. There are some more or less important endless dialogues that should have been shortened in my opinion. This movie would have just been fine with a running time between ninety and one-hundred-five minutes in my opinion. Apart of that, the story is not only down to earth but also quite unspectacular and there isn't that much going on in two hours and a half. The movie feels a little bit too simple at some points. Apart of the acting, the movie lacks of a true highlight. The killing scenes are really unspectacular and you don't see very much. It's the same thing for one single and quite boring sex scene. The movie is supposed to have a few humorous moments but they really aren't all that memorable. The showdown in the mall also lacks tension. It shows us the same scene from three different views which gets quite redundant. The only truly gripping moments in this movie are the first E encounter between Pam Grier and Samuel L. Jackson in her apartment and the scene when Robert Forster and Samuel L. Jackson go to the Office of the bondsman.In the end, this film could have been a standout movie in Tranatino's career because it's quite different from what he usually does. The film though fails from that point of view and drags on far too long and turns out to be quite unspectacular or even boring at some points. It all feels more like a theatre play where convincing dialogues by solid actors matter but not much more. I have seen far worse but also far better movies and I would only recommend this flick to die hard fans of Quentin Tarantino's works.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Underrated,"Being a huge fan of Tarantinos earlier efforts Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction expectations were of course high. Especially since Jackie Brown is based on the Elmore Leonard novel ""Rum Punch"". And Elmore Leonards stories usually fit the big screen very well, they are actually one of the rare occasions where i usually prefer the film to the novel.Tarantino sets a different mood here compared to the more frantic and violent Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. This is more of a slow crime story that focuses more on being cool than being shocking. I think this movie works very well despite the slow pace which seems to put a lot of people off. Mainly i think it works because the actors are all giving it their best (the casting is also excellent) while Tarantino seems to handle the whole story more gently than in Pulp Fiction. He doesn't stress it, he doesn't run the risk of over-doing the ""cool"" parts. The end result is enjoyable but a lot more somber than what you're used to from Tarantino.All in all i feel this movie is underrated. It's enjoyable, well made and stylish. Recommended to those not demanding all movies to head on at breakneck speed. I rate it 7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Great Heist Film That Is Currently Under-Appreciated,"I see Tarantino's three films in the 90's, not including Four Rooms, as a crime trilogy of sorts, and Jackie Brown is the one that is considered to be the most underrated or by others as the weakest of Tarantino's catalog. I never really had high hopes for this film, because for one it just doesn't have that wit and charm that Pulp Fiction has or the unique style that was demonstrated with Reservoir Dogs. I have now seen this film a couple of times and even from my first viewing I thought this film was great and got even better the subsequent times I came around to it.Jackie Brown is definitely a left turn from Tarantino's films as it wasn't an original idea but rather he adapted Elmore Leonard's novel, other notable work include Out Of Sight and 3:10 To Yuma. This choice of not adapting an original story is strange but it doesn't matter anymore after you have seen it, because it's still an entertaining film. I haven't read the source material but I have read reports that this film adapts the novel accurately and that Leonard's novel is filled with dialogue. This film indeed has that element, which works in favor of Tarantino as he has a complete understanding of how to make dialogue look and sound interesting. This may be dismissed by many due to the fact that it lacks the style and charm that was found on his previous two films, the film instead takes a conventional approach to it's storytelling but personally this isn't really an issue for me as the story is still entertaining to watch unfold and Tarantino doesn't completely lose his touch with this film. True, the film relies on the story in developing it's characters rather than having them spill out words that collectively will shape their personalities, but Tarantino's dialogue and style isn't the star of the film but rather the motivations and intentions of the characters.Looking at Quentin Tarantino's career, his films differ from one another and the director is starting to walk the same lines as Kubrick in not repeating oneself. Jackie Brown is the director's heist film and he has achieved in not grounding the film on the same style and level as the other heist films it is now compared to. The film may not scream out Tarantino but it does at the very least experiment. The heist itself was a genius in execution, how difficult it must be to have us see the same heist and not feel repetitive and tiresome. There are also moments in the film where it uses a split screen showing two moments at the same time, and the film also has unusual choices of transitions. This is the first time we get to see Tarantino's ability to let the audience gain introspection of the characters.In order to get that dark and gritty style that the film needed, Tarantino opted for a change in cinematographer and hired Guillermo Navarro. Navarro is now known as a frequent collaborator with Guillermo Del Toro and those films usually have this murky black tone to it and the credit goes to Navarro's photography. This is also one of the main reasons that it doesn't have that look that is prevalent on the director's previous two films. Jackie Brown's look is definitely one of the reasons that the film has personality and it does allow us to perceive the story with seriousness that it demands. The film's dark tone does lose that humor that Tarantino was known for but that aspect isn't truly necessary here to engage the audience, though there are moments where it does get you laughing.Again, Tarantino stays away from the traditional film score and fills the film up with musical nuggets that works perfectly with the scene. The previous two films touches on tracks within the Rock N' Roll and Pop genre, while here he chooses tracks within R&B genre. These tracks have so much soul in them and it does in a way throwback to the classic films that Pam Grier was in. Though I do wonder if the film would be improved using an original score, even if it retains that quality that the soundtracks give but I guess we'll never know.The film's cast includes a return of Samuel L. Jackson and a number of stars who are known to have lost their touch, in particular Pam Grier. Honestly, I have yet to see a film that Grier is in but after this film, it proves that she has acting chops and that she brings great personality in a role that it's hard to not keep your eyes off her. Grier should have been nominated for Best Leading Actress at the Oscars that year but that is just my personal opinion. The rest of the cast were great with notable stand outs like Robert Forster and Bridget Fonda. Forster plays it more casually but not being near the borderline of laziness, while Fonda brings the sex to the role and she was able to bring the immaturity and bratiness that the role needed. Keaton and De Niro are a bit underused and their characters doesn't really have more to them that I could grasp on to. Jackson on the other hand still brings his usual style that was also found on Pulp Fiction but he changes it enough that it doesn't feel like he is repeating himself.Jackie Brown is an entertaining crime-heist film that definitely needs much more attention. I personally felt that this film is much stronger than Reservoir Dogs but it doesn't capture the greatness that Pulp Fiction was able to give off, regardless of it's stellar cast, amazing music, excellent cinematography, and a story that had me locked on to until the end of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A lesser known but just as strong Tarantino,"When you ask someone to name a few of Quentin Tarantino's films, Jackie Brown is usually not mentioned. After the double whammy of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, the reception of Jackie Brown was a bit more tame. The word was: it's an okay film, but no RD or PF...
But this is still a very solid film. Strong cast all around, great nod to blaxploitation and a beautiful soundtrack. But what really makes this film stand out, is it's level of maturity. It's a more serious film than its predecessors and followers. And the film really shines in the dialogue scenes between Pam Grier and Robert Forster. They talk about growing old and all the pain and regret that comes along with it. Not typical Tarantino, but pretty damn good filmmaking nonetheless",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Less showy than Pulp, but a more mature story that is just as enjoyable","Jackie Brown is a 44 year old air hostess who also acts as a money carrier for her boss, gun dealer Ordell Robbie.  When one of Ordell's other employee's is caught he is forced to kill him, however, before he can get to him the employee tells the police about Jackie and they pick her up.  With Jackie facing jail or being killed by Ordell she strikes a deal with both the police and him to bring in a large stash of money.  However to help her retirement she plans to play the game to her own ends.Coming as a follow up to both Dogs and Pulp, this film was going to be the `greatest movie ever made' or it was going to be met with a critical response that seems to be a bit negative.  It was the hype and hyperbole around anything baring the name Tarantino that perhaps was giving every film he did higher and higher standards to meet, it is wasn't Jackie Brown that was met in this way it would have been the next film, or the next one. However the reviews were mostly good, but it did get some unfair reviews from critics who expected this to continue the upward trend.  In a way I believe that this film did show Tarantino's growth as a director.Where Pulp Fiction was dizzying in it's style and pace, Jackie Brown is much more of a mature, balanced film that is satisfying in a more traditional sense that the design of Pulp.  Developed from a Leonard novel, the plot is a solid crime thriller with a good plot that still gives room for Tarantino to do some time shifting as he reveals some key scenes from different perspectives to allow us to see the bigger picture.  As a story it fills the rather generous running time pretty well and is enjoyable throughout.The film is still full of Tarantinoisms for the fans - the heavy soundtrack, the pop culture references, the witty, slick dialogue.  However where the film stands out is that the characters are actually better than in his previous films where they never really went beyond the story and dialogue. Here not only are they better but they also include well-written female parts!  While some of the characters are as good as they need to be within the confines of the basic crime story, it is in Jackie and Max where Tarantino has grown up a bit - although in fairness this was an adaptation rather than his own script, but he still manages them better than some of his own thin characters.Following the praise for Pulp and Tarantino's ability to rejuvenate careers, he must have had no problem cherry picking for this role.  Grier gives a great performance and should be grateful for the role in an industry that generally ignores middle-aged women (not to mention black women!).  The only thing surprising about her is how poorly she has taken this big lead role and used it to take her career on.  Her performance embraces her age and uses it well, but it is Forster who gives the standout performance here. Not an actor many will be aware of apart from this film, he got an Oscar nomination for this and I think he deserved it.  His performance is very low-key and quite moving - I think I will appreciate his work here more as I get older.  Jackson does what is expected of him and has no real character, but his energy and skill are there to see.  De Niro plays a little against type and is an interesting, but underused character.  Fonda is really, really sexy and has some good lines while the rest of the cast do good work in small roles with people like Keaton, Tucker and Bowen in there.Overall I enjoy this film and can understand why it will never be loved to the extent that Pulp was and is.  However to me this is a more satisfying film with an enjoyable plot and a more traditional delivery.  The development of actual good characters beyond snappy dialogue is what impressed me the most and it sadden me to see him regress about a decade into style without substance with Kill Bill Vol. One.",,Anonymous,Crime

Wtg Q...,"When I first heard the name of Q's next movie, Jackie Brown, I figured this would be a remake of a 70's Pam Grier blaxploitation flick (i.e- Foxy Brown). I quickly learned that this was actually an ode to the legendary Pam Grier! Loaded with possibly the best and deepest cast since True Romance, and very similar in many ways, this movie delivers on all levels. Like T.R., a combination of road trip movie (this time airborne), gangsters, comedy, druggy/pimp story, and love story molds itself into a great story. A fantastic revival for Robert Forster- who'd never been awarded the shot he deserved, as Max Cherry, our star and hero of this film. Robert's been historically type cast as a gumshoe cop in numerous roles- Mulholland Drive, South Beach, Rear Window, Me, Myself Irene, but really breaks out in this opportunity to portray a character with actual personality,integrity, wit, and passions. Hail to Robert! Fantastic deliveries from Michael Keaton who revives the Ray Nicolette character seen in Out of Sight, Bridget Fonda's transformation as the stoner surfer girl, DeNiro as the shifty ex-con, Samuel J as the untrustworthy Ordell, and most impressively the one scene delivery of Chris Tucker- with the famous improvised line 'You sneak up on a Nigga with this sh#t!'...

"Decent, but don't expect a Pulp Fiction sequel","""Jackie Brown"", the 1997 film starring Pam Grier as the title character, a flight attendant who smuggles cash into the country for a shady associate, Ordell (Jackson) is the third film directed by Quentin Tarantino. When Jackie is tagged by the feds, (played by Keaton and Michael Bowen) she is willing to give up Ordell because she has a plan of her own. Meanwhile, Ordell has proved himself to be a pretty nasty character, killing associates without even a hint of betrayal, so to say that Jackie is walking a tightrope is an understatement. Rounding out the cast is Robert Forster as Max Cherry, Jackie's bail bondsman hired by Ordell when Jackie is initially arrested by the feds, and eventual love interest, Robert DeNiro as Louis, an associate of Ordell's who is fresh out of jail and about to buy in on one of Ordell's gun selling schemes and Bridget Fonda as Melanie, one of Ordell's women, and object of both fascination and irritation for Louis.""Jackie Brown"" features many ""Tarantinoisms"" that we have come to expect from his films; slick cinematography, a soundtrack that is perfect for the film (in this case, 1970's R&B) a rich cast of eccentric characters, a solid amount of violence and even more profanity. If there was a Tarantino film that DIDN'T include these elements, I would be disappointed. As John Travolta was dug up to star in ""Pulp Fiction"", Tarantino resurrects two 1970's actors, Robert Forster and Pam Grier, and both prove once again that there are few contemporary directors around who have better gut instincts and an eye for casting than he. Although there could have been many other bigger name, safer choices that would have jumped to be in Tarantino's perceived follow-up to ""Fiction"", the film geek once again proves that he knows best. Grier is absolutely luminous, and looks at least 10 years younger than her actual age. Better than that, she is sexy, spunky and knows what she wants. The supporting cast is also excellent, and while it's definitely film geeky to admit it, like the actors who appear in the ensemble films of Paul Thomas Anderson or Wes Anderson, I always admire the cast of Tarantino's film because while they may not have a large or prestigious role in the film, they are always juicy characters that are sometimes played against type. I loved seeing Michael Keaton as a hard-faced, leather jacket clad fed, and Robert DeNiro, who can chew scenery better than a lot is fantastic as the quiet, shlubby and slobby sidekick.Anyone who approached ""Jackie Brown"" looking for a Pulp Fiction sequel was probably either somewhat disappointed or, like me, encouraged that Tarantino can not only do flashy, but can spin a good story as well. And perhaps even more importantly, he wasn't a two-trick pony with the inspired films ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"". While I have mixed feelings about Tarantino the man, (I am endeared to his almost autistic-knowledge of film and his inherent film geekiness, but I am both fascinated and repelled by his almost constant hysteria and, particularly in the infancy of his fame, his inability to turn down an acting job or engage in ceaseless self-promotion) I certainly count him among my favorite directors and anytime he releases a film, it's an event. Before seeing his latest releases, ""Kill Bill Vol. 1 & Vol. 2"" I lamented that he possibly took too much time off between projects, but after seeing ""Vol. 1"" I quickly reconsidered, saying that if he is going to consistently put out superior product, he can take as much time as he wants.And that is why I look at ""Jackie Brown"", a film that wasn't quite as stellar or lauded as his others with a certain amount of fondness, because it is a great piece of work, without all of the flash, bells and whistles of its predecessor. Knowing that a ""Pulp Fiction 2"" would be an instant hit, Tarantino decided to go in a different direction, and it's that willingness to take a chance, even if it's not a huge leap, that makes me appreciate it that much more. It's probably my least favorite Tarantino film, but even my least favorite Tarantino film garners a better rating than 80% of contemporary cinema. Even Tarantino fans that I know let this film go under their radar, so if you are in the same boat, seek this one out; it is well worth it. 7/10 --Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the Best Movies ever made,"I've never been a big fan of Mr. Tarantino's movies, but when I viewed Jackie Brown I was smitten.
I've been watching movies since talkies were in their infancy, through all the westerns and detective movies that kids like to ""grown up"" films, and I believe I've seen most of the best ones.
But Jackie Brown is a film that has it all. Adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel, Mr. Tarantino has developed it into a sparkling tale featuring characters that are at once likeable and detestable.
I don't want to go into the plot because it may reveal too much, and I'd rather talk about the characters.
Samuel L. Jackson as Ordell Robbie is a casual, fun-loving guy who deals in illegal arms. He's all that but at the same time as ruthless as any mobster we've ever seen on the screen.
Bridget Fonda is perfect as Melanie, an addicted bit of eye-candy who lounges about the house keeping Mr. Jackson company and doing little things such as answer the phone or bring him a drink.
Robert De Niro in one of his finest performances is dull ex-con Louis Gara. He's just out of prison. Mr. Jackson allows to stay with him for a while mostly for the extra company. Mr. De Niro doesn't have to say or do much to show us he's dull, possible has a fried brain from drugs. It shows in his eyes. They're dull and we know he's now quite all here. What we don't at first know is that he has a very short fuse. That's probably why he was in prison.
Tiny Lister doesn't actually do much. He finds people for Max Cherry. If we skipped bail we wouldn't want him to come after us. We can see in his posture that he's serious.
Robert Forster is Max Cherry, a bail bondsman who's tired, getting old and just wants to retire. But when the phone rings, he's all business.
Michael Keaton stands out as a jaunty agent who's out to get Mr. Jackson but the real star that puts this film over the top is Pam Grier.
She's Jackie Brown, a middle-aged single woman working for a second-rate airline. She just wants to get enough money together for the future. Flying out of the country enables her to pick up gun money to bring to Mr. Jackson.
Everyone in this ensemble cast is so perfect and some of the scenes are at once a jolt, yet at the same time inevitable, that one viewing is simply not enough. Nor are two. This is an amazing of artful direction.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Ultimately, a bit boring, don't you think?","This film has a great start and a very memorable opening sequence. Our main character is on an airport track and is going forward on a conveyor belt set to a great tune. Fantastic use of the camera and a great song to go along with it, but then once you get to the movie, beyond the stylized and interesting opening, the film starts to slow down and goes on for 2 1/2 it didn't need to.The thing that defines the film from Tarantino's other work is that is not his own creation (or his own ripoff of someone else's creation) but a legitimate adaption of a novel. Tarantino's style was never that conventional and when you see him working within conventional cofines, which is sort of what this is, despite being a vibrant-feeling piece, his whole style just doesn't work and he can't acomodate proper pacing. Tarantino's style is suited to fast-pased thrillers or just things told of out of sequence. When he tells a character-driven crime story in a rather linear matter, his very superfluous direction and writing ends up chugging the whole thing down, when it should be either speeding the thing up or directing more so its focus. The opening is more in line with his type of films, but once it gets into relationships and more complex elements of story and character, the thing just kind of drags.It's got so much good in it, with great acting and great dialouge, but Tarantino just doesn't pace it right cause he can't handle a story of this type and the movie ends up feeling a bit boring, by the time you're finished. Still, though, it's got so much good in it, that it's not necessarily a bad way to spend an afternoon but maybe there'll be a point, where you wish it were it over, when there's probably still a good amount to go.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Jackie Brown is some lady.,"Jackie Brown works well thanks to a great cast and Tarantino's mastery of cinema technique. As Jackie Pam Grier almost steals the show but Jackson and DeNiro are strong support. The plot is a complex bit of double crossing, when Jackie finds herself trapped by the police to give up her dangerous associate in order to gain freedom. It flows along punctuated by extreme closeups, long tracking shots (that would do credit to Orson Welles) driven at times by pop music. All of which Tarantino manages very well. In the end the direction takes a lot of credit for the success of this thriller in the wake of Pulp Fiction. The violence is understated by comparison, but all the more shocking because of this. Well done.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tough-talking but surprisingly low-keyed Tarantino curiosity...,"Quentin Tarantino's much-anticipated return to film-making following ""Pulp Fiction"" is an intriguing character-drama about a cool-headed flight attendant in cahoots with a merciless gunrunner who ends up playing both sides of the law to save herself from going to jail. From Elmore Leonard's book ""Rum Punch"", and full of punch-drunk people, dreamers, and low-life scuzzies with cockeyed, crazy ambitions. Great acting by nearly everyone (particularly Robert Forster as Pam Grier's bail-bondsman), but in the end it does feel a little thin--especially as the plot is stretched out too long. Tarantino's technical dazzle is certainly in place, but there's possibly too much exposition for the film to really hit the bull's-eye. Hot soundtrack, lots of funny/scary moments courtesy of the auteur, and some fine conversational dialogue, as when Grier tells Forster about her record collection: ""I was gonna buy a CD player, but I didn't feel like starting over."" *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Boring..,"I had way too high expectations about this movie. Quentin Tarantino is by far the best and coolest director, in my opinion, and watching Reservoir Dogs (my favorite movie), Pulp Fiction and the Kill Bill movies, I understood what Tarantino was really about; blood, violence and a fast tempo. But Jackie Brown has none of those things. If another director had made this movie then people would probably go on saying that it was good and it had a good story and so on. But Tarantino knows what he's all about (I'm sure) and he knows what his fans like, once again fast tempo and violence. Plus a great soundtrack. Making this movie wasn't so smart. But I hope he'll continue with the cool movie making, cause he really knows how, and that we will see more of his greatest movies in the future. Thumbs down for Jackie Brown, but thumbs up for the coolest dude on earth.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Quentin strikes again.,"Where does a director go after making two colossal worldwide hits?""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) and ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) were two of the greatest movies ever made, and they launched director Quentin Tarantino into the realm of Mainstream Hollywood Director. Most of the time, a director faced with this reality will sink into a slew of really bad movies, but so far Tarantino has been either extremely lucky or extremely talented - his third feature film, although lacking in the brutality of its predecessors, contains just as much wit. Based upon the Elmore Leonard novel ""Rum Punch,"" it's packed with the clever dialogue that Leonard is known for in his writing. It's also got a good amount of style, too. It's not a typical Tarantino movie, but is that necessarily a bad thing? In this particular instance, no.Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight stewardess forced into running jobs for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), a ruthless criminal who has no respect for life - or death, for that matter. However, during one of her smuggling efforts, a couple of FBI Agents (including Michael Keaton) nab her and offer her a deal: If she helps them get Ordell, she will be let free from custody. The Feds do not know who Ordell is, but they know he exists, and that is where Jackie comes in. She reluctantly agrees to participate in their sting operation, but all is not what it seems. And when $500,000 dollars disappears from his retirement fund, Ordell stops, thinks, and arrives upon the conclusion that we all anticipate with glee: Jackie Brown did it.His partner in crime, Louis (the wonderful Robert De Niro), also decides to double-cross Ordell, with the help of a sexy blonde ditz named Melanie (Bridget Fonda), The movie's twisting plot line and intersecting story lines is very reminiscent of ""Pulp Fiction,"" and De Niro's underrated performance is a real stand-out. The movie's quite well made and enjoyable.Don't misinterpret what I'm saying. This is no ""Reservoir Dogs,"" nor does it want to be. It's not in the same vein as Tarantino's other movies, at least not at a superficial level. However, it is extremely entertaining, helped along by a great cast and a terrific script. The only difference here is that Tarantino did not come up with everything by himself. He adapted the screenplay from another source, something he usually doesn't do. But there's also a little-known fact that Roger Avary co-wrote some of ""Dogs"" and ""Fiction"" with Tarantino, as well as sparked the idea for some of his films. Here, Quentin adapts Leonard's novel and does justice. People who say it isn't as good as his other movies because it's recycled obviously don't know what they're talking about.Tarantino started out as a video store clerk, and is the movie buff's filmmaker. Not only does Tarantino share a deep passion for films, but he also knows what most of the real movie enthusiasts want. He has yet to disappoint me with any of his directorial efforts. His own life story would make an interesting movie, and indeed it did with ""True Romance,"" partially based on Tarantino's own self-image of himself. (A geek working at a comic book store falls in love and goes off of an adventure into a new realm -- in Tarantino's own case, it was film-making. For Clarence, from ""True Romance,"" it was drugs and murder.)Tarantino has a flair for raw energy in all of his films, and ""Jackie Brown"" is no exception. The movie is bursting at its edges, packed with wild antics and the occasional fierce brutality. The movie was criticized by Tarantino's die-hard fans for being too different from his other films. However, the mistake of many directors is to repeat the same formulas over and over again. One must at least give Tarantino credit for trying new things in each of his films. If anything, the only thing that Tarantino likes to insert into all his films is a large source of energy. And is that a bad thing?4.5/5 stars.",,Anonymous,Crime

"A solid, character driven movie","When we insert our Quentin Tarantino movie into the machine, we expect to be bombarded with action, and perhaps sex. If this is what you're looking for, you may walk away disappointed. While this film does not provide a gun shot or beating around every corner, or breasts every few scenes, it does provide us with an intricate look inside a half dozen interesting characters. Don't get me wrong, it packs a mean punch compared to the average flick, just perhaps more mature and talkative compared to the average QT thriller. I personally commend Quentin for swaying off his action crammed image and simply telling an interesting story with a few sporadic gun shots here and there. Unless you can't stay seated without action in almost every scene, I would recommend this flick be seen.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino grows up,"Quentin Tarantino follow up to the hysterical response generated by his suitably hysterical first two movies was 'Jackie Brown', an altogether more restrained film that garnered a somewhat more restrained set of reviews. Perhaps the relative lack of impact made by this film explains his subsequent return to extremes with 'Kill Bill'. But in some ways this is a shame, as there's a lot to enjoy in 'Jackie Brown', particularly in the universally first rate performances the director manages to get out of his distinguished cast. Robert Forster is wise and weary as a middle-aged bail bondsman, Samuel L. Jackson plays a criminal with all of the menace and none of the charm of his character in 'Pulp Fiction', while Bridget Fonda and a (cast against type) Robert de Niro are entertaining as a pair of useless crack-heads. Best of all is former blaxploitation star Pam Grier in the title role, combining human warmth and coolness under fire with considerable charm. The generic Ellmore Leanard plot is ultimately not quite as clever as it promises to be, and as as ever with Tarantino, both tone and taste are sometimes questionable: the early sequence 'Women Who Love Guns' is very funny, but it's quite unclear whether it's intended as satire or celebration. Nonetheless, once one adds in a typically splendid soundtrack, everything adds up to a movie far above the average crime thriller, and for all the breathtaking invention of his other movies, it's enough to make one wish that Tarantino didn't usually feel the need to try so very hard.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
This is how to write a female protagonist,"With so many failed female protagonist movies today I just had to revisit this one. I think Hollywood should learn a lot from Jackie Brown and Kill Bill on how to write a character.This is yet another nicely scripted movie by Quentin Tarantino that is forgotten most of the time.Every actor and actress were just perfect and everyone was stealing the show in every scene especially Samuel L. Jackson. Unfortunately , for me , Robert Forster gave a poor bland performance thru the whole movie. I really wish they made him a little more entertaining but I still enjoyed his relationship with Jackie Brown.The movie has some very nice and clever twists that you never see coming.Sadly there are some scenes that are just not logical making this movie a bit confusing if you are looking at details.The first 30-45 minutes were slow even for Tarantino and his well written script.Thankfully with some patience you will definitely enjoy and have fun with this movie.The character of Jackie Brown is quite
simplistic and linear just like the plot of this movie but the way she was written in this movie is really charming. She is a strong , independent woman yet vulnerable and loving.

I was mislead by all the glowing reviews here,"This is the only Tarantino movie I hadn't seen because I hadn't heard much about it, so I thought I should remedy that. I liked every other one, except Death Proof, so I thought there was a good chance I'd like this too, especially after seeing all the glowing reviews on IMDB.
I don't need lots of blood and violence to enjoy a movie, but good writing, editing and tension have always been a Tarantino mainstay that I've enjoyed. Sadly, this didn't seem to have any of those. It's also way too long, at 2.5 hours. It should have been a 1.5hr movie. There's so much unnecessary filler that goes nowhere, which Tarantino calls ""hang out"" scenes. I could have used much less of them.
Instead of dragging things on like the movie did, I'll just list my pros and cons.Pros:
-Pam Grier, Samuel L Jackson and Robert Forster are great in this
-Nice soundtrackCons:
-Drags on a lot with a lot of dialogue scenes that seem interesting at first but ultimately made me tired of all the slow pacing
-De Niro was wasted on this. His character wasn't interesting at all
-Story was OK but not really that compellingIf you like the ""typical"" Tarantino movie, don't come in expecting the same quality. If you want something different than his other movies and don't mind slow pacing, you might enjoy this.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining and exciting thriller that keeps you hooked during its 160 minutes,"Tarantino once said that Jackie Brown was a film that was most enjoyed the second or third time you saw it and I must admit that I agree now. This is an entertaining and exciting thriller that achieves the goal of keeping you hooked during its 160 minutes, with an intelligent and very well executed screenplay.The film managed to hook my attention from start to finish, but in order to follow the tangled story without being confused I had leave unnoticed a few details that I only got the second time I saw it. These types of films in which the viewer can overlook certain important details, and that require subsequent scenes of explanation, in my opinion, remove subtlety from the story. However, although I did not feel this with Jackie Brown, since Tarantino knew how to provide the amount of information necessary to keep us informed and intrigued at the same time, the way certain information and some facts were revealed to us did not completely convince me.Leaving aside the treatment of some transitions between scenes, which I think could have worked better, technically the feature film is quite solid. I loved the use of the colors yellow, red and blue in the photography and the costume desing, as well as the choice of music, since I feel that they complied with giving personality and a very particular tone to the film. Likewise, despite not having read the novel, the adaptation seemed great to me. The way Tarantino decides to develop the story and the way in which the motivations of the characters make sense, result in natural and slightly forced acts. The scenes that serve to explain what is happening, as I mentioned lines above, could have been better narrated, but this does not remove suspense or emotion from the plot.Likewise, the direction was well executed with interesting panning camera movements that take you from one character to another, and recurring closed shots that fulfill concentrating our attention on the actors and their dialogues. Except for a couple of scenes involving Ordell and Beaumont (Chris Tucker) and which I consider to be very well accomplished, the overall direction is not outstanding.Another element of the film worth mentioning is the acting. Pam Grier, the protagonist, gives an excellent performance that allowed her to participate in important awards that season. It's worth mentioning that this character was intended exclusively for her after Quentin Tarantino was impressed with her talent on a previous audition. In the same way, we have a Samuel L. Jackson showing one of the best performances I've seen of him so far. Jackson manages to blend perfectly with his character and dialogues, taking him from being a fun and friendly subject to a true and desperate psychopath. Although for me it is he who should have had an Oscar nomination for his performance in this film, it was Robert Foster who ended up obtaining it with his excellent work playing Max. Recall that at that time Robert Foster was going through a career decline so he accepted, without hesitation, when Tarantino specifically sought him out for this role. Finally, the film shows us some solid Robert De Niro, Michael Keaton and Bridget Fonda who I think did a great job in the scenes where they worked.Finally, Tarantino confessed that he feared that Elmore Leonard, the writer of the novel, would hate the film, but the author ended up later revealing to him that it was possibly one of the best scripts he had read. I don't know if that's the case for me, but Jackie Brown is definitely a film that, although not perfect, is very well written, has an entertaining and compelling story, and is excellently performed. Whether you are a Tarantino fan or not, it is a movie that I definitely recommend watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

There is no sense to make this kind of little above average ""realistic"" dramas if your name is Quentin Tarantino. The man has a very special talent for creating pulp stories with pulp characters. Tarantino should be proud of that and stick with his talents.Same goes for Kill Bill. Great Tarantino flicks(Reservoir, Pulp + Romance) are not about action, not about drama, they are all about cool characters with cool dialogue. Jackie Brown is not a great Tarantino film - it's not even a great genre film. Just an above average crime drama.

"Tarantino's best film, a tremendously entertaining thriller","Quentin Tarantino takes on Elmore Leonard? At first look not such a good idea but coming to ""Jackie Brown"" several years after its more or less lukewarm initial reception (released after so-called masterpiece ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the inventive and infectious ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Jackie Brown"" was seen as something of a disappointment) and being able to assess it without putting in context of Tarantino's filmography, ""Jackie Brown"" is surprising.It is, without question, Tarantino's most mature and complete work to date as a director. Mature in the sense that Tarantino here is not preoccupied with 'homages', references, style (not too much, at least), or indulging himself in his fantasies. Tarantino, for once, is primarily a storyteller, and the approach works stunningly well. ""Jackie Brown"" is a fantastically entertaining crime thriller that not only does justice to Leonard's source material, but in some senses improves on it (admittedly, the novel this is based on is hardly his best work). The cast is a dream for this sort of movie, and contains what is as of 2008 Robert De Niro's last truly memorable performance, the music fits perfectly, the atmosphere created is the sort you can lose yourself in for the running time of the film (which feels significantly shorter than it is), and the screenplay, with its witty exchanges, striking characters, and plentiful plot twists, keeps the viewer more than entertained. This is a truly engaging film.Tarantino movies do it for me. I don't think he's one of the greatest directors of all time or anything, but he is a talented director with the capacity to make tremendously entertaining films. While many would prefer him to do films like ""Kill Bill"" I think ""Jackie Brown"" is a far better representation of his talent. He's certainly not completely out of his element here, there's plenty of 70's retro cool in this film, but thankfully it is contained and kept from going overboard.Expect another ""Pulp Fiction"" and disappointment is an understandable reaction, but if you go into this with an open mind and expect nothing in particular you might just find that ""Jackie Brown"" is not only Tarantino's best but one of the most entertaining films of the 90's.9.5/10",,Anonymous,Crime

Watching again 25 years later.,"I have to admit that when this film first came out it went over my head. I think because I was young, I couldn't empathize with the characters. Now, being 40 years old, I found myself really loving the film. The soundtrack very well could be Tarantino's best. Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street"" is used so well in this movie at the films beginning and end, and the ironic thing is that the movie takes place in Los Angeles. The song by itself will move you, but coupled with the awesome cinematography of this film and the movie's plot, it's VERY effective. The final shots of the movie are absolutely beautiful with Robert Forster walking out of focus then cutting to Pam Grier lip syncing along to the song's chorus as she drives off into the next chapter of her life. Everyone gives an incredibly good performance in this movie. Chris Tucker's small but important part is very funny but also feels so real... Samuel L. Jackson is incredibly good and has the privilege of delivering some of Tarantino's best written dialogue... and I must say that his wardrobe and hair are totally awesome. Pam Grier is perfectly cast. A comeback performance and she's still HOT and TOUGH. Bridget Fonda kills it as the as the irritating pot head brat... Robert DeNiro... some of his best and most interesting work. Micheal Keaton cast perfectly as the ATF agent. Robert Forster also gives a come back performance that's outstanding. Seriously, the casting job on this film could not be any better and these actors DELIVER. They truly understand who their characters are. THAT my friends is what happens when great talent is working with one hell of a good writer and director that is willing to take risks. Quinton took a big one adapting Elmore Leanard's novel, Rum Punch.This is Tarantino's most mature film. It's plot is simple, but as a young person watching it 25 years ago, I had a hard time accepting that because it wasn't filled with over the top villains and action. I was just too young to relate to each characters motivations. I highly recommend that people that haven't seen this film in 25 years, in the wake of Pulp Fiction, give it another chance.

Jackson, Robert Forester, Robert Deniro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Michael Bowen, Chris Tucker, Tiny Lister, Aimmie Graham and Sid Haig.I'll go over the plot and then review it. Ordell Robbie(Jackson) is an illegal arms seller. One of his aquaintences Beaumont Livingston(Tucker) was put in jail for carrying a machine gun that he bought from Ordell. Ordell goes to Max Cherry (Forester) and gets a 10,000 dollar bond to get Beaumont out of jail. After getting him out, Ordell pays Beaumont a visit and kills him.Later.....while walking in the airport parking lot from her job as a stewardess, Jackie Brown(Grier) is stopped by two FBI agents Mark Dargas(Bowen) and Ray Nicholette(Keaton). They check her bags and we soon figure out that Beaumont told everything to get out of going to jail. Jackie is Ordell's money runner for the guns he sells. Unfortunately, in the money bag for him, the buyer had slipped in some cocaine for Ordell and Jackie goes to jail. Ordell goes back to Max and has him move the 10,000 dollars from Beaumont to Jackie. Max drives her to her house and is beginning to fall for her. Ordell goes to Jackies house to try to kill her, but Jackie stole Max's gun and protects herself. This all spirals into fooling Ordell out of 40,000 dollars.My review: 9 out of 10. Robert Deniro and Bridget Fonda were excellent together as Ordell's friend and girlfriend. Keaton has a gem role that's small but important. Grier and Forester are in their best roles ever and Jackson is good as always.

Tarantino sees off the backlash,"Quentin Tarantino is clearly finding it difficult to follow the phenomenal success of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", which made him the hottest writer-director of his generation.  In the six years since then this is the only time that he has returned to the directors chair.  ""Jackie Brown"" - his ""difficult third film"" - seems to be his response to criticism of his first two films that he could only make movies about other movies, but not real life.  He cleverly anticipates the backlash by adapting a tightly plotted, character driven Elmore Leonard novel, still set in his familiar world of LA low-lives, but keeping to a minimum his trademark comic-book violence and pop-culture references, while emphasising the novels more mature themes - such as ageing and the feeling of time running out for the middle-aged characters.  The result is a slick, interesting, if slightly draggy thriller, which ultimately lacks the freshness and audaciousness of those earlier films.Tarantino still has his maverick streak though, as displayed in his trusting of Pam Grier to carry the entire movie.  The casting of a middle-aged black actress with no box-office clout in the lead role can't have been easy in an industry notorious for it's scant regard for actresses after they reach 30. You can bet that the studios would have at least insisted on the safety of a Sharon Stone or a Demi Moore.  But Tarantino, as he did when casting Travolta, stuck to his gut-instinct, and once again it proved an inspired choice.  Grier, bringing with her the memories of her 70's blackploitation movies, gives a convincingly tough, wise and sympathetic performance.Actors love to work with Tarantino because the roles he gives them will be invariably jucier than usual.  That is once again the case here, although the casting isn't quite as inspired as it was in ""Dogs"" or ""Pulp"" (or ""True Romance"").  Samuel L. Jackson is reliably good - if hardly stretched - as an unscrupulous hustler who is not as smart as he thinks he is, and Bridget Fonda has fun as his conniving beach babe girlfriend.  Robert Forster jumps at the chance to play a role with depth after years in made-for-tv hell. Robert De Niro though, despite providing some amusing moments, is disappointingly wasted as Jackson's dim-witted partner.At times this feels like just another thriller, but every now and then Tarantino reminds you what all the fuss was about.  Jackson's brutal (off-screen) dispatching of Chris Tucker in the boot of a car, as the camera slowly cranes up into the sky, is masterfully conceived and a scene, which is subtly built up to, involving a teasing Fonda and a p*****-off De Niro is as unexpected and as shocking as anything Tarantino has done before.  By refusing to make a Pulp Fiction 2, Tarantino may have missed out on some easy money, but this film has enough to suggest that he will be more than just a flash in the pan.",,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino's Most Underrated Picture,"""Jackie Brown"" is a crime-thriller about a flight attendant who finds herself caught up in an ATF investigation involving an arms dealer. The film stars Pam Grier as Jackie Brown, Samuel L. Jackson as Ordell Robbie, Robert Forster as Max Cherry, Brenda Fonda as Melanie Ralston, and Robert De Niro as Louis Gara. This is the third feature film from Quentin Tarantino. ""Jackie Brown"" is one of Tarantino's most unique pictures; excelling in subtlety, wit, and pacing.The performances in ""Jackie Brown"" are well-constructed. Pam Grier plays the titular character. In contrast to many of her Blaxploitation roles, Grier takes center stage as more than a caricature for male fantasy. Jackie Brown is intelligent, cunning, and a bad ass all the same. Grier breathes life into Jackie Brown through a wide palette of emotion. In her dialogue, she exhibits anger, fear, and joy with the inflection of her voice. In addition to her delivery, Grier's body language is one of her strongest assets. By large, she is the film's glue. Samuel L. Jackson counterbalances Grier's soul with snakish charm. Jackson's portrayal of Ordell Robbie is devious and chilling. Ordell has charisma and style, however he is cruel. Jackson's best moments are displayed through non-verbal body language. His facial expressions are his strongest attributes. Ordell Robbie may be one of Jackson's most underrated characters. While Jackson and Grier excel in personality, Robert Forster completes that package with his old school Hollywood acting prowess. Forster's character Max Cherry is thrusted in the middle of the film's conflict. He steps in as the audiences surrogate. He is the film's straight man, yet he displays a lot of heart. Cherry gradually transforms into a warm character. Forster plays off both Grier and Jackson as the voice of reason, while simultaneously matching their strong performances. The supporting cast does a great job of keeping up with the film's three central characters. De Niro gives one of his most low-key performances as Louis Gara, while Brenda Fonda is bombastic and colorful as Melanie Ralston. Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen are sprinkled in as an ATF agent and LAPD detective. They each give weight to the film's circumstance through their non-yielding presence as the authorities. In sum, the cast of ""Jackie Brown"" is really good. They have great chemistry - and their performances double as a ""how to"" guide on fine acting.""Jackie Brown"" has a strong narrative. There are many twists and turns in the film's plot. While character motives can be seen as complicated, the film does a great job of identifying each person's central goal through exposition. The film's complex set up is one of its' strengths. There is never a dull moment. Tarantino crafted a tight screenplay that does not waver. One of the best aspects of ""Jackie Brown"" is the use of perspective. Akin to Francis Ford Coppola's park scene in ""The Conversation,"" portions of the movie are depicted from different character standpoints that add new details and new meaning to the central action. Tarantino kills two birds with one stone by replaying the same scenes, while adding each character's essence to the aforementioned scene. One of Tarantino's defining trait is his well-written dialogue. ""Jackie Brown"" is no exception to this. The dialogue and language used in ""Jackie Brown"" is well-crafted. Each character feels unique, yet their speech connects to one another and adds more weight to the story. To say ""Jackie Brown"" has a good narrative is an understatement. The film's plot and dialogue are very strong.The cinematography is great. Director of photography, Guillermo Navarro does a great job of matching the script's complex narrative with top-notch camera work. The opening scene is an iconic character introduction. The steady-cam dolly on Jackie Brown on a moving walkway is one of the film's best shots. Throughout ""Jackie Brown,"" the camera often follows the characters, mimicking verite and presenting a documentary-esque feel. It makes the drama feel real - and proves compatible with the already excellent story. The film's editing is solid, but at moments rough around the edges. A few cross dissolves feel unnecessary. The sound-mixing is really good for the most part, yet when the characters talk on the other end of a phone - their audio tracks do not match. It's often as if the characters are in the same room as the other characters while being on the opposite end of the phone. It's a minor gripe that can be immersion-breaking. Despite, very minor editing issues, the film has a great style. The soundtrack adds so much to the mood and tone of ""Jackie Brown."" It's a fun movie to look at - with great music to compliment the visuals.Overall, ""Jackie Brown"" is Tarantino's most underrated film. It's novel, it's witty, it's well-paced, it's charming, and it's a great experience. ""Jackie Brown"" should be remembered as a film that gave Pam Grier and Robert Forster their best performances. Defined no less than what it truly is - a thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Peep This Reviews,"It seems that this gem becomes overshadowed sometimes by Tarantino's other films. But it's easily one of his best.

Street life... street life...,"Jackie Brown is a crowning stylistic achievement that merges the 90s crime film with the low-budget exploitation films of the 70s. That sounds like it could be the kind of kitsch that Tarantino's next couple of films would fall into, but here it works beautifully, and seems like a perfectly natural style to make a film in. It's old school without ever being old-fashioned.The story is fairly complex, revolving around a money-exporting operation and the small fry that get caught up in it and then decide to go into business for themselves. Pam Grier is a likable heroine, and it's quite refreshing to see a middle-aged black woman in the starring role, but it's Robert Forster as her bail bondsman partner that really steals the show. He makes me want to watch a TV show about bailing people out of jail, which is something that never would have occurred to me before.In the end, there isn't a lot of significance to this story or the way it's told: it's just a very well-done crime film with a fantastic cast, a knowing but not excessive sense of humour, and some charming music. Everything fits together more or less perfectly, and though it's almost 150 minutes it doesn't drag. Not a life-changer, but it can make for a very good afternoon.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Masterpiece,"Along with ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" this is Tarantino at his best. The great novelist Elmore Leonard was on board as Executive Producer, insuring that this great script was on target. The perfectly cast actors all give perfect performances, often the best in their careers. The caper at the core of the drama is arguably the most complex and well worked out that we've ever seen. The music is very well chosen, even when it's just faint in the background from an unknown source. This is also Elmore Leonard (""Get Shorty,"" ""Hombre,"" ""3:10 to Yuma,"" ""Valdez Is Coming"") at his best. If you don't think it's a perfect movie, see it again....",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
not as good as other tarrantio's,"It was always going to be a hard act to follow classics like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and unfortunately Jackie Brown doesn't deliver to the standards set be Tarantinos previous efforts.  Whilst this is an enjoyable, whilst slow paced movie, it doesn't hit the viewer on the same level and actually left me slightly disappointed.  This does not, however, mean that you shouldn't see this film, whether you are a Tarantino fan or not.  It may be better viewed if you are not an enthusiastic fan of the director.Based on Elmore Leonards novel Rum Punch, the movie strays away from the book, so much as changing the colour of the lead to black.  Pam Grier does a good job of playing the forty something caught up in money laundering and Samuel L Jackson delivers a great performance as Ordell, but the film unfortunately fails to grip the audience, and unlike Pulp and Dogs, this is not a film you will want to watch over and over again.BEST ACTOR: SAM JACKSON is funny, witty and truly scary as Ordell.  BEST ACTRESS:  PAM GRIER was perfectly cast as Jackie and fits in perfectly. BEST SCENE:  The three different views of the money exchange is one of Tarantinos best set pieces.  BEST QUOTE: 'Wanna F&$k?', from Bridget Fonda is very sexy.OVERALL: 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very good,"I do not understand why this movie is not noticed among the movie world. If I were to ask somebody who directed Jackie Brown, I do not think they would be able to tell me. This movie, although not nearly as action packed as Pulp Fiction, has great dialogue and at times can be very humorous. The soundtrack is arguably Tarantino's best (And he knows his music) and the characters are well rounded and unique. Although some people feel like the ending is bad and in some ways ruins the movie, I felt as if it were the perfect fit for a movie like this. Also, each character seems to get their own scene to show off both the actor's talents and the way the character acts compared to those around them. ElmoreLeonard's writing mixed with Tarantino's attitude make this movie a sure 10/10 and it is enjoyable, if not more enjoyable, every time I see it. Tarantino knew his material, and turned it into one of the best movies I've ever seen.It might take a second viewing to truly appreciate it. If you don't focus so much on the plot, which is phenomenal, the second time around and focus on the amazing dialogue, you will see what makes this movie a true gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The stars are Quentin Tarantino's vehicle,"Like other Quentin Tarantino films, Jackie Brown has more than its fair share of deadly violence. Although you may think that Pam Grier and Sam Jackson are the film's stars, this movie is all about Tarantino's angle of vision into worlds most of us know nothing about (and wouldn't care for if we did). It is clever, elevates criminals, laughs at the police and kills characters off at regular intervals. Unlike some of his later movies, Jackie Brown lags at times -- and some of its scenes (Pam Grier strolling and then running to make it to the flight gate on time) are overly lengthy. I suppose you'd have to say that Grier is the star of this film because the plot really does revolve around her but Sam Jackson outshines her (in my opinion).",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Wow, so so boring!","As you may have guessed I hated this film. It was so boring I kept looking at the clock to see when it would be over. The premise of playing the same scene over from different points of views might have worked in an interesting movie, this however was not. Acting was weak and rather dull. Pam Grier may be the worst actress I have ever had the displeasure of watching. Quentin Tarintino is an amazing writer/director, unfortunately this is by far the worst movie he has made.

"An excellent, low-key character study with the usual Tarantino quirks","Arguably director Quentin Tarantino's greatest film, and his third straight masterpiece in a row following the creative success of Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), with his firm grasp of character, narrative and dramatic involvement at something approaching a career best. Unlike the first two films aforementioned, Jackie Brown (1997) is something an obvious step-back from the hip dialog, cool violence and narrative experimentation of his more characteristic work; with a mostly straight story placing the emphasis on the dynamics of the central characters and the continual themes of middle-age hopelessness and the need for fulfilment; all of which seems fairly radical when looked at within the context of Tarantino's career as a whole, and in particular his two most recent films, Kill Bill (2003-2004) and Death Proof (2007). Unlike the more self-aware, post-modern self-reference of those particular films, Jackie Brown is an entirely low-key affair; built around an outstanding central performance from Pam Grier and an accomplished ensemble cast that compliments the character of Jackie - as well as the theme of people living off past glories - with Tarantino capturing the action with a restraint and intelligence that many of his detractors might conveniently choose to overlook.As ever with Tarantino, the writing is intelligent enough to support both the mechanics of the plot and the reliance on character interaction, with a lot of the film simply being supported by the complicated relationships between the characters and the downtime that occurs during the more obvious moments of exposition; with the two strands coming together on a number of occasions to show these characters as fully-formed, complicated human beings trying to do right, when all along tormented by the need to succeed. There's also Tarantino's great use of colour and composition - still entirely low-key but completely suited to the subject matter - the always great use of music to both establish a mood and set the tone for the characters, and an incredibly complicated final act that dips into the territory of Kurosawa's Rashomon (1950), albeit, with the director's always interesting use of long takes and intricate tracking-shots. The handling of the central theme of the film, of middle-aged characters looking back to the past and seeing only the defeat of their later lives, is brilliantly conveyed by the casting of actors considered forgotten or ""washed up""; with the central performance of Grier as the still sassy Jackie Brown being matched by the performance of Robert Forster as proto-love interest Max Cherry, or De Niro as the past-it career criminal, itself a sly reference perhaps to De Niro's own drop in quality over the last fifteen years.There's also fine support from Tarantino regular Samuel L. Jackson, as well as Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Michael Bowen, Tommy Lister and a cameo by former ""blacksploitation"" icon Sid Haig. Without question, Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature picture to date; not only in the sense that it's characters are more seasoned, beat-up and worn down than those found in the previous two films, but in the intelligent and thoughtful way that the film has been put together. True, there's nothing here that is as radical or as iconic as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction, with the gunplay and sporadic bursts of violence having been toned down to a bare minimum; but regardless, the film still fizzles and pops with an energy and enthusiasm that makes Tarantino's work so original and worthwhile. What we have here is an honest look at criminal characters that is as real and unglamorous as you could possibly get, with the dialog enriching and complimenting these characters, as opposed to defining them, and the film-making sensibilities of the director capturing the essence of the story, without overwhelming it.",,Anonymous,Crime
Totally Unique,"It's based on ""Rum Punch,"" a novel by Elmore Leonard and for those readers among us, that is a very familiar name. Leonard has a way with dialogue as much as he has a writing style with some of the most irritating transitions in modern pop literature.But he also has a tendency to spin unique plot webs that you never really see from any other writer.Most of the time it is the mundane tried and true ""Cop and the witness against the bad guy, serial killer, mafia boss...enter cliché here"" motif that you've seen in a million other movies. Elmore always takes it a step further for the sake of originality.Instead of the same old thing you have the Bail bondsman and the middle-aged Stewardess against two corrupt ATF agents and an arms dealer with delusions of grandeur.What could be better? You have the pairing of Leonard and Tarantino, two masters of dialogue, two masters of entertaining plot lines that come together to give you a little gem of a film that you will never see the like.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
probably Tarantino's finest effort,"Jackie Brown is probably the only movie by Quentin Tarantino i'd watch more than once. The reason is that in this one we see characters, not caricatures. We even see an occasional moment of genuine emotion by some of them.Of course, with Tarantino it is always a question whether there is a higher meaning behind his output. Jackie Brown is a crime thriller, but i haven't been able to find any context apart the obvious.The cast is well chosen, the setting the regular shady world of crooks and gangsters. As with all his movies, a superb soundtrack accompanied it. And on the wave of success of Pulp Fiction i think this is where Tarantino decided to make a movie in every possible genre he loved. Everything filmed after Jackie Brown confirms my assumption.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Tame ending, and a less gratuitous than Tarantino's other films","Some would call this a tamer/toned down version of Pulp Fiction... I don't know. I guess it is, but the film is also more devoid of Tarantino's style than any of his other work. The non-linear time-line would be the prime example of this; it's only used in a handful of scenes, rather than the one thing that keeps the film going, as is the case with one or two of his other films(Reservoir Dogs, arguably Pulp Fiction). The film has much less violence, sex and drugs than any of his other films as well, which, together with the non-linear time-line, is Tarantino's trademark. However, in some ways, it lifted the film above expectations of the standard Tarantino production; instead of sitting there, waiting for some shocking violence, I actually payed attention to the story, which is more than what I can say for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction(Kill Bill managed to juggle both things, Tarantino's style and a good, interesting plot perfectly, which is partly why I like it more). The problem with the plot, however, is that it's so damn confusing... if you don't pay perfect attention every single second of the way, you'll miss something. Normally, this would rate high with me, as I like films where it pays off to pay attention... only, this one doesn't. It doesn't pay off to pay attention, because the one reason there is to watch the movie, is to enjoy Tarantino's unique style, which, as I mentioned before, is not as present here as it is in his other movies. The ending is a anti-climax, and a powerful one, since it gives you exactly the ending you expect from the very start of the film, and you realize that you've just spent two and a half hours, watching something that ended exactly the way you knew it would end. Pulp Fiction ended unexpectedly, both in time and situation. Kill Bill had a great twist, at the end of each part/volume. Even Reservoir Dogs had a better ending than this. The plot is a pretty good, but a little too predictable, and it has almost as bad a pace as Pulp Fiction; the thing that kept me watching was my enjoyment of Tarantino's style and the fact that I wasn't as confused by it as I was by Pulp Fiction. The predictability might have something to do with me having seen so many other Tarantino's films, but it still should have surprised me more; all of his other films surprised me, some more than others, but all surprised me at some point or another. The characters are well-written, like with most of Tarantino's other work. The dialog is also about as good as Tarantino's other films. The soundtrack is also pretty good, but it's inferior to his other films, in my opinion. The actors are all well-cast. Hmmm... what else... I don't know, all in all, it's just a typical Tarantino film, with the twist that it's in several ways different from, uh, the typical Tarantino film. That's pretty much it. If you're into Tarantino's style, you'll enjoy it, but you have to love his films and style to really love it. I recommend it to fans of Tarantino, who are up for a slightly different film from what he usually does. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Jackie Brown - A Masterpiece in the Shadows,"Released in 1997, Jackie Brown stands as one of Quentin Tarantino's most overlooked films, often overshadowed by the more iconic Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. While it may not have captured the same level of public attention or critical acclaim, Jackie Brown is a masterclass in character-driven storytelling, blending Tarantino's signature wit with a slower, more deliberate pace that allows for nuanced performances and richly developed characters. It's a film that deserves far more recognition than it has received, and in hindsight, it has proven to be one of his most underappreciated works.At the heart of Jackie Brown is Pam Grier's performance as the titular character, a flight attendant caught up in a scheme involving drug smuggling, FBI agents, and criminals. Grier, known for her iconic roles in blaxploitation films like Foxy Brown and Coffy, brings a depth and complexity to the character that transcends the typical tough-girl trope. Jackie is not a superhero; she's a woman trying to navigate a treacherous world while playing the long game. Grier's performance, filled with quiet strength and vulnerability, is arguably one of the finest of her career. It's a testament to her skill as an actress that she makes Jackie both a formidable force and a deeply relatable figure.Unlike Tarantino's previous films, Jackie Brown doesn't rely on breakneck pacing or non-linear storytelling. Instead, it takes its time to develop its characters and their motivations, with a measured approach that allows the film to breathe. The plot is relatively simple: Jackie is caught between the law and the criminals she works with, and she has to outsmart both to secure her freedom. Yet, it's the way Tarantino builds tension through conversations, subtle character moments, and long pauses that sets Jackie Brown apart from other films in his oeuvre. It's a movie that lets you live in its world and get to know its characters on a much deeper level.The supporting cast is equally remarkable, with Robert Forster's portrayal of Max Cherry, a bail bondsman who becomes Jackie's ally, standing out as one of the film's most memorable performances. Forster brings a warmth and sincerity to Max, providing the perfect foil to Jackie's more guarded persona. Their chemistry is understated but palpable, and their evolving relationship forms the emotional backbone of the film. The supporting characters, including Samuel L. Jackson's unforgettable turn as the menacing Ordell Robbie and Michael Keaton's cameo as an FBI agent, further enrich the story with their colorful, well-defined personalities.What makes Jackie Brown so special is its dialogue. While Tarantino is known for his rapid-fire exchanges and pop culture references, this film feels more grounded and restrained in comparison. The conversations are often slow and deliberate, allowing for the characters to reveal themselves through the things they don't say as much as through what they do. The sharpness of Tarantino's dialogue is still very much present, but it's balanced by an underlying melancholy and a sense of realism that gives the film emotional weight. It's a movie about ordinary people caught in extraordinary circumstances, and the dialogue reflects that.The film's pacing, which might feel sluggish to some, is actually one of its greatest strengths. Tarantino's decision to let the story unfold at a more methodical pace allows the audience to become fully immersed in the characters' lives and the tension that simmers beneath the surface. There's a sense of anticipation in every scene, as the stakes gradually build until they explode in a series of explosive confrontations. The film's slower rhythm allows the emotional beats to land with greater impact, making the eventual payoff all the more satisfying.The soundtrack of Jackie Brown, a carefully curated collection of soulful tracks, perfectly complements the film's vibe. It's a soundtrack that fits the mood without overwhelming the narrative, providing a sense of nostalgia and emotional resonance. The music choices aren't just there for style-they reflect the themes of the film, weaving a sense of longing and regret into the narrative. The music, much like the film itself, is understated yet deeply effective.One of the reasons Jackie Brown has been underappreciated is because it doesn't conform to the high-octane expectations that often accompany Tarantino's work. It's quieter, more introspective, and more patient than his other films. But that's precisely what makes it stand out. It's a film that rewards careful attention, offering a wealth of character detail and subtle commentary on themes like loyalty, betrayal, and the complexity of human nature.The film's underperformance at the box office and its relative lack of attention compared to Pulp Fiction are unfortunate but understandable. Jackie Brown is a slower burn, one that requires the viewer to invest emotionally in its characters and their journey. But for those who take the time to appreciate its depth and craftsmanship, it stands as a highly rewarding experience. In many ways, it's a mature reflection of Tarantino's unique voice, shedding the flashy tricks of his earlier films in favor of something more nuanced and heartfelt.In hindsight, Jackie Brown deserves a more prominent place in Tarantino's body of work. It's a film that showcases his ability to craft deeply human stories while still maintaining his distinctive style and flair. It's a movie that's rich in character, atmosphere, and dialogue, and while it may not have had the same immediate impact as some of his other films, it has only grown in stature over the years. Jackie Brown herself may have been caught between two worlds, but Jackie Brown is a film that deserves to be recognized as one of Tarantino's finest achievements.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Emperor has shown us he ain't got no mother-f***ing clothes on,"In Tarantino's screenplay for ""True Romance"" the main character, Clarance says: ""Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those a**holes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books."" Unsurprisingly, that line didn't make it into Tony Scott's movie. About five years ago I tried to read the book that Tarantino turned into Jackie Brown, but lost the will to finish it. And I don't think I would have lasted the 2.5 hours of the movie if I hadn't kept telling myself that it was made by the Emperor of all things post-modern.The problem is this: it's Tarantino without the gimmicks, without the shocks, without the over-cool sense of style. And if you take away all that, there ain't too much left. His comic-book characters just don't stand up to prelonged bouts of soul searching realism. I just got plain bored listening to a bunch of low-lives waffle on about themselves. If this is the way Tarantino sees himself going, he's just gonna end up as a poor-man's Scorcese.The danger always was that Tarantino would start to take himself seriously after Pulp Fiction.

Robert Forster plays a much larger part than I was expecting at the beginning, which is only a massive plus as he gives a great performance.

It's aged excellently.,"This was the only Quentin Tarantino film I'd only watched once... until tonight! Took me 12, maybe even 13 years to revisit it, but I'm glad I did. Either it's gotten better with age, or I didn't fully appreciate it before. My memory of it before was that it felt like a perfect 2-hour movie stretched to 2.5 hours, and I don't really feel that way anymore. It certainly takes its time in places, but I think it earns its length. If anything, it could potentially be a scene or two longer... part of me wonders if the final scene would hit harder had there been more time spent with two main characters together, but it's already a great scene/ending as is. Maybe one more scene showing De Niro's character unraveling could've helped; the suddenness is jarring in a way that maybe sort of works?I do also appreciate how restrained Jackie Brown is compared to other Quentin Tarantino movies. Maybe I wanted a little more humor and/or violence the first time I watched it, too, but the fact it keeps some of his trademarks while dialing others back makes me respect it more now. It's a shame he says he'll retire after his next movie, because this showed he was already great at dealing with older characters and slower stories, and that's something I imagine he'd be able to do just as well, maybe even better decades later (guess he demonstrated that well with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which is probably his second most restrained film).Also, what a cast here. Everyone is perfect for the role they play, and I love seeing actors I've seen in dozens of other movies (like Robert De Niro and Samuel L. Jackson) play the kinds of characters they don't usually play (De Niro's such a schlub for much of the movie, and Jackson's genuinely terrifying as an antagonist, where I usually think of him more as either an anti-hero or a sidekick/supporting character). Michael Keaton was also much better than I remembered - his comedic/manic energy is perfectly utilized. But the film belongs to Pam Grier and Robert Forster, the former so cool and charismatic and the latter so vulnerable and endearing. They're two of the best characters in any Tarantino movie.Speaking of Tarantino movies: I wouldn't call this my favorite, but I like it even more than I remembered (and I still really liked it before).

I really feel like I've wasted 2 and a half hours on something boring. The plot was predictable since Jackie started to play the both sides. And everything was going slow, really slow. And as other Tarantino films, at the end everything is escalating quickly but not in this case. I like Tarantino as a director but he's terrible as a writer. The dialogues are really good but the whole point of the movie loses it's sense because it's procrastinated so much. Half of his movies are really good and the other half are really boring.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino's difficult 3rd movie,"After the unforgettable twin strike that was Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino did the only sensible thing he could and that was to make a solid third film. He couldn't possibly top his first two movies so, instead, made a less flashy character driven crime flick. Furthermore, he reigned in his style more by basing his film on another source (Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch) as opposed to another of his original screenplays, although admittedly much of the dialogue has been rewritten by Tarantino; the story, however, remains much the same. What emerges is the most mature work in the director's career. It isn't as good as the more personal Dogs or Fiction but it's definitely an excellent crime movie and a great adaption of the book.Elmore Leonard's books are full of snappy dialogue and cool characters. They are prime material for a director like Tarantino, and so it proves here. Samuel Jackson returns from his star-making turn in Pulp Fiction to take on the role of Ordell, the charismatic gun dealer. He is ably supported by Robert De Niro in a very unglamorous role as Ordell's sidekick and Brigitte Fonda as his waster girlfriend. But the movie possibly belongs to the two less famous performers Pam Grier and Robert Forster. Both are sensational, contributing multi-layered performances. Where Forster gives the movie its heart, Grier is its driving force. It could be argued that the film as a whole is Tarantino's tribute to Pam Grier and the blaxploitation film genre. Grier certainly justifies QT's adulation and delivers the goods. It's also a great and unusual thing to see a relationship between a middle-aged man and woman being the core of a film directed by a hip young film-maker, or any film-maker for that matter.As much as I enjoyed Tarantino's work since this movie, Jackie Brown proves that he can make a movie with more substance and character depth. While it may not have the sheer dynamism and fresh invention of his first two movies, it does feel more satisfying that the Kill Bills and Death Proof. I think it would be a good thing for QT to revert back to this style of film-making approach in the future, as the movies about movies approach that he has subsequently adopted can surely only end up at a dead end. Where nowadays he frequently lifts soundtracks from other films, and as a result takes you out of the movie, in his first three films he constructed his soundtracks from 60's and 70's pop songs; and this approach worked much better as this music was not solely associated with other films. Although in the case of Jackie Brown the music is sometimes taken from 70's blaxploitation films, it still doesn't seem quite so obvious. Jackie Brown comes recommended for fans of both Tarantino and crime thrillers in general. Like the book it may not have the greatest plot but its characters are well-drawn and well acted by the excellent cast. A very satisfying movie overall.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Undeniably cool though it pales in comparison to Tarantino's best efforts,"""Jackie Brown"", based on the novel ""Rum Punch"" by Elmore Leonard, was Quentin Tarantino's hotly anticipated follow-up to ""Pulp Fiction"". It met with generally favorable reviews but is today overshadowed by much of Tarantino's other output.The story revolves around the title character, a middle-aged stewardess (Pam Grier) who gets caught transporting illicit cash for her arms-dealer boss (Samuel L. Jackson). As a result, the authorities coerce her into aiding them. However, she soon hatches a plan for a complex con that will satisfy her legal obligation while also fattening her pocket with some of her employer's ill-gotten funds.The script, while adapted from someone else's work, has much of the usual Tarantino style. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the film gets bogged down somewhat by the sheer complexity of the scam that Jackie is trying to perpetrate. It takes a lot of time and exposition to set up the caper and in the end the film has little to offer beyond the superficial plot. That being said, Tarantino does manage to fit a fair amount of character development into the film's two and a half hours.The cast gets high marks. Samuel L. Jackson delivered a performance that was every bit as good as his turn in ""Pulp Fiction"". Both Pam Grier and Robert Forster had their careers rejuvenated by their assured performances in prominent roles. Robert De Niro doesn't spend much time in the spotlight here but his performance is marked with nuance and skill. The rest of the support is solid too, especially Chris Tucker in a small but entertaining role.Naturally, Tarantino's direction is top-notch. While I can't recall any particular visuals that stood out the overall presentation was carefully considered and well executed. Tarantino also displays his penchant for savvy soundtrack choices, this time using a number of R&B gems with a dash of sixties rock for variety.Ultimately, though, the film's relative lack of action and convoluted plot make it a little less compelling than other Tarantino offerings. It's still a cool flick but don't expect something on par with ""Reservoir Dogs"" or ""Pulp Fiction"".",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Solid crime drama with lots of tension. The plot is very good, but also quite predictable and below Quentin's standards.","I really enjoyed this trip at the end of the 90s, and ""Jackie Brown"" is still after more than 20 years a solid movie. Two hours and half flew away. This is one of the less violent Tarantino's movies. Sure, there are a couple of gruesome scenes, but nothing too graphic, therefore everyone should be able to watch it, without issues.Repeating the success of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" is a difficult task. I can only imagine that at the time there were huge expectations, and unfortunately mine were disappointed. I did not see the same creativity or the same screenplay complexity of his two previous flicks. The story is predictable and very straightforward. Cannot say that I was really surprised, there were no twists and the end was exactly how I pictured it. What I really appreciated was the tension that QT built on some scenes, in this he is really a master. I know what is going to happen, but I don't know how is going to happen. This is the true power of ""Jackie Brown"".Pam Grier gave life to one of the most iconic characters in American cinema history. She is fearless and clever. She has to overcome a lot of issues along the way, in order to accomplish her plan, but in the end her strategies are successful. Together with Max Cherry they formed an incredible partnership. Nothing is handed to them and I feel that their ""happy ending"" is really earned. Odell was good, but he was really not so special. Samuel Jackson always had more or less the same role in Quentin's movies and in this case I saw the laziest depiction of a criminal in his entire narrative universe. Also Louis was pretty much bland, and I do not know how you can get a character wrong with a guy like Robert De Niro. The rest of the cast was okay.The soundtrack has something special. Every protagonist has his own theme song. Lyrics well describe them as people and highlight certain characteristics that are never explained in a dialogue or in any other way. This was an amazing detail that for sure inspired many other productions afterwards. Colors, photography and editing are stunning, I could clearly see that every shot was thoroughly planned and every camera movement thought in a certain way.This was probably the first attempt for Quentin to approach a larger audience, by removing some of his trademarks: he did not push so much for violence, dialogues were captivating, but missed that creative spark, characters had a lot of highs and lows and the plot could have been way better. His previous two movies at the time were real shockers and he showed things that most of the people never saw in the commercial cinema. Both are now considered cults. This one played safer and did not get much enthusiasm from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Jackie Brown - ***** out of *****,"Tarantino is obviously one of the most consistently fascinating filmmakers of the past few decades. I would imagine that even his detractors have to concede a certain level of prowess and love of cinema that is undeniable in his craft. For me, JACKIE BROWN is his crowning achievement, with the KILL BILL movies being a close runner-up. This film encapsulates all the great characteristics of Tarantino as a moviemaker, and the screenplay which he co-wrote with Roger Avary is one of the best adaptations ever. (It is based on the 1992 novel RUM PUNCH by Elmore Leonard.) The dialogue here just sings, it crackles. I love the pulpiness of it, the way it takes an intricate plot that could easily have been used in a 1940s noir film and gives it a modern sensibility. Samuel L. Jackson frankly scares me to death in this movie - it is his finest screen performance. Pam Grier and Robert Forster make for a surprisingly engaging duo, and they add a humanity and a core decency that is missing in some of Tarantino's other films. This will always be for me not only the overlooked, underrated gem in Quentin Tarantino's oeuvre, but one of my favorite films of the 1990s.- Jeff Marshall.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Killings are unlikely but Fonda delectable.,"Three killings done in public places without attracting attention are very unlikely and detracted from what was otherwise a realistic flick.  Also, the murder of Melanie was just too extreme to be a likely scenario.  Fonda was terrific as the druggie old hippie chick.  Jackson, tho, made the whole thing work.  I could have done without those looong shots of Grier walking to various places.  She was certainly stacked high and proud in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Is it worth 2 1/2 hours of my life to watch them?This movie is promoting violence in a sneaky way: It makes you like a character which seems good, then he commits a crime, just because he is a bit afraid or frustrated!And what's that all about ""Jackie Brown"", the title of the movie and the over-promotion of the character like she was some sort of national or local hero or diva? That was at least naive and bad from a cinematic perspective and from an ethics perspective too.Conclusion: No, it doesn't worth 2 1/2 hours from my and your life.

Perhaps the most subtle movie from Tarantino,"I don't think Tarantino has ever directed a movie with less gunfights, blood and gore, which is by no means a bad thing. Jackie Brown is more style than action, but it's still unerringly Tarantino. Everything from the music to the dialogue to the characters is pure him. It's simply more of a thriller instead of an action film.The eponymous Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is an airline stewardess who, as means to make more money, smuggles drugs and cash for Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), a fairly successful drug lord. A deal goes sour and Jackie needs to do one last big job for Ordell to preserve her life. Things get complicated when a bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) develops feelings for Jackie. The rest is great conversations, intriguing characters, style, class, some violence and a really good criminal masterplan. Tarantino in a nutshell.Neither Grier or Forster had acted in a leading role for a long time before this film and this movie helped revitalize their careers. And not undeservedly so. Grier especially is phenomenal in her role and this movie is considered to be one of the best action/thriller films with a female protagonist. She's resourceful, tough as nails and quick on her feet, but she's also way in over her head, but making it work for her. Great character, one of Tarantino's best.Jackie Brown is largely a con job film, so I shall say no more in fear of spoiling it for you, but trust me when I say that it's well worth a watch, whether you are a fan of Tarantino or not.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Jackie Brown,"Samuel L. Jackson really steals the show here as the petty criminal ""Ordell"". He sells guns - gradually accumulating a small fortune which he smuggles in from Mexico using the services of the eponymous air stewardess (Pam Grier). When his well oiled machine starts to splutter, he avails himself of bail bondsman ""Cherry"" (Robert Forster) and so starts a complex story that sees people drop like flies; policeman ""Ray"" (Michael Keaton) get involved and we build to a sting operation not seen since Paul Newman in 1973. A great soundtrack that doesn't overwhelm some good performances, a pithy and dryly humorous script with the foul-mouthed tirades from the rather ruthless ""Ordell"" working well to develop his character and a really solid effort from Grier as the middle-woman who is very capable of thinking on her feet! There are a couple of scenes - not least between ""Melanie"" (Bridget Fonda) and ""Louis"" (Robert De Niro) - that are genuinely laugh out loud and the threads knit cleverly and from left field a bit at the denouement. This might be my favourite Tarantino film - it has pace, style, character and engaging contributions from a cast that work and deliver well together.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Didn't I blow your mind this time?""","These days, when a director becomes a household name, there's a pressure on them to live up to their established reputation. If the formula changes the fans don't take it well. This is at least partly thanks to the auteur theory, which tends to value a director's work on its consistency rather than the actual quality of each movie. After his revolutionary hit Pulp Fiction, his follow-up Jackie Brown was not exactly a flop, but its reception among critiques, awards ceremonies and the general chitchat of Tarantino aficionados was somewhat lukewarm compared to the raging success of Pulp Fiction. What was wrong?Jackie Brown differs from previous Tarantino projects in that it is adapted from a novel, rather than being an original screenplay straight from the director's brain (albeit filtered through his many cinematic influences). It contains rather less of the dialogue-for-dialogue's sake that was so integral to the appeal of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, so no ""Royale with Cheese"" business here. It still has plenty of cracking dialogue in pursuit of plot though, and scenes such as Lewis trying to explain what went wrong with the switch are glowing examples of Tarantino's black humour. Overall it's a finely constructed thing, a nod towards the lovers-in-crime sub-genre of film noir as much as it is a stylistic homage to blaxploitation. And perhaps it's those romantic undertones and the slightly more low-key violence that put off many of the less broadminded Tarantino admirers.Always something of a minimalist behind the camera, Tarantino's visual style here is at its most simple. Like a Sergio Leone picture, every scene basically boils down to a stand-off between two characters. Tarantino mostly eschews camera movement, just giving us stripped-down shots of people glaring at each other. Of course some may miss the more flamboyant touches that could be seen in his earlier movies, but for the sake of story and character, he is better without them. Special mention must be made of the music in Jackie Brown. Tarantino is of course known for his use of popular music soundtracks, but here it is more apt and co-ordinated than ever. The opening sequence is perfectly timed to ""Across 110th Street"", the aching melody and lyrics setting the tone of the whole movie as Pam Grier strides along to the beat. At other times the soundtrack is even witty, as when Robert Forster steps out of the changing room. Tarantino should try making a musical one day. It'd be amazing.The simplicity of Tarantino's approach has given more prominence to the cast. Blaxploitation star Pam Grier here gets her most significant role in years, slotting into Tarantino-world with ease and confidence. She has a lot of silences – her refusal to answer when she's asked if the envelope can be searched, the long close-up of her while Michael Bowen interrogates her offscreen – but she constantly acts through them, subtle reactions flickering across her face. Crucially she has the necessary strength of character to make us believe she would stand up to cops and gangsters. Other honourable mentions must also go to Robert De Niro, bringing presence to his small part, and his unlikely but fruitful pairing with Bridget Fonda, who matches him for comical delivery.Jackie Brown clearly lacks the superficial pizazz and deconstructed narrative that wowed everyone in Pulp Fiction, but in its place there is a clear, strong story arc and a slightly more human, emotional slant. To my mind that's more than a fair exchange. But perhaps it's most helpful not to consider what it is or is not in comparison to its predecessor. Jackie Brown is an excellent movie in its own right.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

My Favourite Movie of all Time,"What's amazing to me about this movie, is that it managed to fully captivate my attention, despite the fact that I generally don't like drama movies, and have ADD. Usually I need horror films with jump scares, or high action films with lots of loud fighting to keep my attention. But in some mysterious way, the director of this film made even the slowest most non eventful parts incredibly interesting to me.In all, I can't think of a single scene that didn't deserve to be in the movie. There are some rare parts that don't seem entirely essential to the story to me. But those parts are still great just on their own, and would stand on their own as short films.One thing that really makes this movie unique for me is the strength of its female lead protagonist. Strong aggressive female characters in other movies almost always feel forced to me. Like they are trying too hard to be seen as respectable leaders, but actually just come off as jerks. I don't think I am sexist, but I might be on some subconscious level. However, the actor playing Jackie Brown plays the part of an aggressive strong protagonist like a natural. The fact that she is a woman taking on an authoritative and strong role, against violent and strong men, didn't stand out to me at all during the movie. It all felt natural. Jackie still comes off as a nice likable woman, and not a jerk at all.If I were forced to come up with just one criticism, it would be that it wasn't long enough. The story is completed by the end, in a satisfying way. But I cared so much about the characters that I wanted to keep seeing more of their lives, even if it was not eventful.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is a lot better than I remember.,"JACKIE BROWNI first saw this movie when it was first released and I hated it. I thought it was boring. now after 14 years I decided to try it again...The movie is about a flight attendant named Jackie Brown. She gets caught up in a huge arms deal and decides to risk everything to help herself other than anyone else.The movie is quite slow going. There is not a great deal of action in it, but the character building is brilliant. A lot of time is spent getting to know the characters and dialogue. That is one thing I love about Quentin Tarantino﻿s movies. The man really knows how to build a character. The dialogue in all of his movies is what makes him stand out from everyone else. This is one of the reasons why he is one of the best.Another thing that is really good with this movie and a lot of Tarantinos films is the soundtrack. I read that he bases his films around the soundtracks, and this has some classic songs throughout.Even though there is not a lot of action, you can't help be get drawn into the story and trying to guess what Jackies next movie is. All the way through the film I was trying to guess what she was doing and who she was actually helping. It is a good film to keep you thinking.The casting was fantastic. Every single actor did a great job in this movie and they all deserve some credit. Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Robert DeNiro, Bridget Fonda & Michael Keaton star in this movie. It was also a nice surprise to see a young Chris Tucker and also Sid Haig appear too.The main thing I noticed from this film compared to most of Tarantinos others was the lack of violence.

An Absolutely Brilliant Character Piece,"Look at Jackie Brown talk. Look at they way she's the fuel behind the conversation, a driving force one intellectual level above her verbal opponent. How, when in trouble, she doesn't collapse under pressure — instead, she, cigarette in hand, talks from the side of her mouth with striking sass, at once condescending and commanding. How she can merely lift an eyebrow in sly disdain and scare the sh-t out of the person sitting across from her. She's tough. She's smart. She's sexy. She's  Jackie Brown.To most, Pam Grier is an action heroine, a Coffy, a Foxy Brown, or a Friday Foster; she's the Queen of Blaxploitation — hell, she is the blaxploitation movie. But she's a cult favorite, a black Angelina Jolie of an era forgotten by most. And after the subgenre ended in the late 1970s, things changed for the leading lady. Most movie executives had no idea what to do with her (too resilient to be tossed aside as a meager love interest, too arousing to convince as a matronly, sexless authority figure), so she spent the majority of the '80s and '90s philandering around in thankless supporting roles that could hardly capture her brassy appeal.So Hallelujah Quentin Tarantino noticed her past highs while working as a video store clerk before he became the boy wonder of the independent movie: giving her the role of a lifetime, ""Jackie Brown"" is the movie Pam Grier was born to star in. Not cheap, not badly written, not supported by a bundle of terrible actors, not hastily directed, she no longer is the best thing in a bad movie (a characteristic most of her best films kept in their chest pocket for everyone to see); she's the best thing in a great movie, and by 1997, it was about time.In ""Jackie Brown"", Grier is as badass as Coffy ever was, but she's also quite a bit wiser, a tough cookie all grown up. Jackie is 44-years-old, a stewardess for the worst airline in America, and makes a disappointing salary of $16,000 a year. She's had trouble with the law before, but in her middle-age she's become much more methodical about her criminal actions, preferring to keep things low-key enough to keep herself happy and the cops oblivious. Currently, she acts as a smuggler for Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), a corrupted arms dealer so closely monitored by the ATF that he's forced to work with an odd assortment of runners for the sake of keeping business afloat.Things turn sour one day when, en route to work, Jackie is stopped by a couple of ATF agents, who find Ordell's dirty money and a few ounces of hard drugs in her handbag. She spends the next few days is prison, eventually finding bail through Max Cherry (Robert Forster), a worn-out bondsman. Following her release, the ATF presents her with two options: she can either (1) avoid jail time and direct them to one of Ordell's schemes by acting as a courier once again or (2) go directly back to her jail cell and forget that they ever offered her such a deal. The scrappy Jackie chooses option one, but she's never been one satisfied working alongside the law or following the orders of a street smart but academically winded guns dealer. So she comes up with her own plan: double-cross both parties (telling the heat she's going to betray Ordell,, telling Ordell she's going to betray the heat), run away with $500,000, and buy a one-way ticket to Spain and start life anew, with lavishness.Whereas all of Tarantino's films deal with violence as part of the aesthetic, ""Jackie Brown"" trades pulp fervor for insanely sharp exchanges of dialogue, the only carnage occurring offscreen while the characters size each other up and entertain us with their canny games of one-oneupmanship. Much of his mainstream success depends on the ruthlessly funny intrigue of ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Kill Bill"", but look closely — while not so tongue-in-cheek, the cunning ""Jackie Brown"" quite possibly delivers his finest screenplay, so endlessly amusing that there are a number of moments that call for near inescapable applause. The climactic money exchange, conceived in the same style as 1956's ""The Killing"", is so ingeniously drawn that I found myself laughing in delight, not because so much of it's humorous (which a lot of it is), but in disbelief. Call Tarantino an idiot savant of the cinema all you want — but he's brilliant.Equally brilliant is the accomplished cast — with no obvious supporting characters, the performers are of equivalent importance in pushing the lustrous plot forward. Grier is a sensation as the titular character, a victorious combination of sexy and too da-n tired; Jackson is as threatening as he is inexplicably winsome. Forster provides an amiable straight man who loves Jackie too much for his own good, De Niro is lucrative as Ordell's dim-witted, raging partner-in-crime, and Bridget Fonda, who gives the most uproarious supporting performance (in a movie of unlimited uproarious supporting performances), is hilarious as Ordell's pot-smoking, surfer-girl mistress.It's less grandiose than Tarantino's other movies, but ""Jackie Brown"" is a masterpiece nonetheless, with a screenplay dressed to kill and a leading lady ready to smack all the Julianne Moores and Sandra Bullocks out of the picture and provide a leading lady to be reckoned with. If you're as smitten with the film as I am, you'll know what I mean when I say I never wanted it to end.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not halve as good or memorable as Tarantino's other work but still way above average of course!,"Yes this is a Tarantino movie alright there is some trademark typical Tarantino dialog and a complicated and ingenious story. But something is missing here, especially compared to Tarantino's his other work.Main problem is I think the characters. They are good all and eccentric in a way but they are not really memorable. Especially the main character Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is disappointing. She isn't really strong enough as a character to carry this entire movie. Real main character of the movie to me was Samuel L. Jackson but why oh why did you had to wear that odd looking pony-tail Sam? Character that I truly liked was Robert De Niro's. He plays a sort of loser role like you wouldn't expect from him in a movie like this. The rest of the character aren't really strong or interesting enough to carry this entire movie.Really strongest element of the movie is the brilliantly written script that once again is filled with some typical Tarantino elements and twists. Yes, the ending might had been a bit weak and perhaps disappointing but no it did not ruined the movie for me. I still enjoyed this movie, it just wasn't as good as I had hoped for. It was kind of like the movie ""Out of Sight"" by Steven Soderbergh which has a kind of similar build-up-style and story, it comes very close at times but it never quite takes the cake.Still a perfectly watchable, mostly fun movie but still you're better of watching Tarantino's other work.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino. Underrated.,"When movie is better than a book...
It's a Hangout film, where you spend time with the characters. There is time devoted to crime, just like there is to war in Inglourious Basterds - that is, very little. The most important thing is that the film is not about gangsters, but about aging and accepting yourself at any age, which is what Jackie Brown and Max Cherry are talking about. This is the main leitmotif of the film, wrapped in a stunning soundtrack of funk and soul of the 70s.Underrated gem from 90's.

A Decent Film that Falls Below the Usual Top Standard Set By Quentin Tarantino,"Pros:
1. The soulful soundtrack adds a really fun and energetic feel which layers a lot of life into the film.
2. There is excellent use of lighting to foment particular atmospheres. A great example of this would be when Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to intimidate Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) in the dark.
3. The comedy elicits constant laughs, especially in regards to the commentary on race.
4. The costume design is fresh and lively thus cementing that 1970's feel, as summarised by Ordell Robbie's get-up.
5. Samuel L. Jackson, Pam Grier, and Michael Keaton (Ray Nicolette) give fantastic performances.Cons:
1. There is far too much screen-time given to Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) as he does nothing for the first hour and 40 minutes, and does little after that.
2. The pacing is way off for the second act as it's needlessly prolonged with useless scenes, or scenes that last way too long.
3. None of the characters, aside from Ordell Robbie, that are likable or intriguing.
4. The romance between Jackie Brown and Max Cherry (Robert Forster) feels massively underdeveloped, and therefore unrealistic.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A solid rewatch,"I have been watching this movie for years. Probably seen it at least 10 times. Do you know who this movie is about? It's about Max Cherry. I wonder what Quentin would say about that. I'm so glad to see Robert Forster play that character. So much going on in his face. Seemed like a real sweet guy.Robert De Niro did absolutely nothing in this movie, What was the best actor in it. So subtle, how does somebody not act and be the best actor in a movie at the same time?I wonder what Jackson felt about playing opposite De Niro? It looked like they had a lot of fun together, especially when they were sitting at the bar drinking together.Bridget Fonda is drop dead gorgeous in this movie.

Jackie Brown,"I've always felt this is one of the most underrated Tarantino films and offers one of the more well-layered and engaging narratives, with the high level of pleasingly eclectic cast I've come to associate with his work. I am not sure if Tarantino deserves more credit for the writing or if the actors do for bringing these characters to life, but either way there are always roles in his films that you could not imagine anyone else ever being cast for once undertaken. Grier's performance in the titular role was on point, and her authenticity was necessary and relied on in order for the plot to work in the audience member's minds. It was Robert Forster that probably takes my MVP this watch, and the shots of him and his partner, played by Tony Lister, definitely did not go unnoticed. Fonda has an entertaining turn too, and it's even more impressive that she was acting across de Niro in most of her scenes. Solid as always on a technical level, and I don't remember feeling like a single scene was unnecessary or wasted. 8.5/10 Samuel L. Jackson Binge: Tarantino and Jackson just click perfectly here (and everywhere else for that matter), as no one is better at giving Tarantino's writing an entertainingly convincing voice. The goatee is just the perfect chef's kiss. In the 1990s, Tarantino was one of the biggest directors around; he had won an Oscar for his writing, and audiences were anxiously awaiting his third film. After acquiring the film rights to Elmore Leonard's novel 'Rum Punch', Tarantino started writing Jackie Brown with the intent of giving the script to another director; however, Leonard loved the script so much that Tarantino decided to direct himself. Jackie Brown takes inspiration from Blaxploitation films like Coffy and Foxy Brown, though with a slower pace and using much less action. Pam Grier, star of both the aforementioned films, was Tarantino's only choice for the lead role and to this day he is amazed that she was not nominated for an Oscar. The film is a slow burn compared to Tarantino's previous two movies and does have its issues with pacing and story consistency but does contain more humour.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tarantino at his best,"This is one of the movies in my DVD collection that I haven't watched too many times but whenever I see it, I really enjoy it. It hasn't got the attention-grabbing scenes or famed dialogue of Tarantino's previous efforts, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, but I rate this film at least as highly as I do his others. The plot's good and keeps you interested and it's refreshing to see a movie whose main characters are middle-aged and trying to come to terms with getting older. The cast is pretty much flawless - Jackson is as reliable as ever, De Niro turns in one of his best performances of the last ten years, Grier is really good in the title role and, based on his work here, I've no idea how Forster didn't become a much bigger star back in the 70s. The soundtrack, as you would expect from Tarantino, is spot-on too. What also struck me about the film is how accomplished the technical side of it is, particularly the camera-work and editing. The late 90s was a good time for adaptations of Elmore Leonard's novels, with Get Shorty and Out of Sight being released in that period as well. However, as much as I like those two movies, I think Jackie Brown might be the best of the bunch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Don't go into this expecting Tarantino's usual fare and you'll love this movie,"Jackie Brown is almost certainly Tarantino's most polarising movie, usually appearing either at the top or bottom of people's rankings of Tarantino films. My friend is one of those who watched it after watching Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Django, etc. and wasn't too keen on it because of its slow pacing.As a huge fan of Tarantino, I have to lay my hands down on the table and say I loved this movie, even though it's generally seen as a movie for people who don't like Tarantino movies.And yet for me, it's one of my top 3 favourite Tarantino movies alongside Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill. Why? I'll tell you.I don't enjoy Tarantino's work for his OTT violence (which this film lacks). I enjoy his work because it always clearly screams a love and passion for the cinema, and because of the tremendous dialogue and characters he uses to construct this world. This movie has all of this in spades, with amazingly fleshed out characters such as the bored, middle aged and directionless two central characters who form a silent romantic bond with each other (Jackie Brown and Max Cherry), the sleazy, cowardly, cunning drug dealer Ordell, his smart-ass girl Melanie, his ex-con friend Lewis, whose laid-back characteristics conceal a fearsome dark side and troublesome detective Ray.The dialogue again works wonders throughout the movie, the acting is pitch-perfect across the board, with Pam Grier, Samuel L Jackson and Robert De Niro being as great as you'd expect them to be, and Robert Forster and Bridget Fonda delivering career best performances and the movie has some amazing sequences, my favourite being the sequence filmed from three different viewpoints, followed by the sequence that involves a promise of waffles and chicken and a car boot (no spoilers for either). And the plot also builds to an fantastic and logical conclusion.In conclusion, let me sum it up for you. If you like Tarantino movies for their OTT violence and OTT characters, you probably won't like this movie. However, if you like Tarantino movies for their wonderfully realistic dialogue and amazingly charming or detestable characters, then you'll love this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

an homage to an earlier genre,"Quentin Tarantino does a magnificent job with ""Jackie Brown,"" a rich film that harkens back to the black exploitation films like ""Foxy Brown"" that gave Pam Grier, the star of this film, her start.Though the plot of ""Jackie Brown"" is wonderful, the characters make this film worth watching. Pam Grier, an actress of remarkable presence and special beauty, plays a flight attendant caught between gun merchant Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), for whom she transports money, and two ambitious detectives portrayed by Michael Keaton and Mark Dugas. She decides to go for a con of her own and enlists the aid of her bail bondsman (Robert Forster). Forster hails from my home town, and he is one who knows a lot about career ups and downs. He first made a splash in ""Reflections in a Golden Eye,"" and when the reviews came out, he was doing construction work outside the newspaper office. The review was thrown to him. He was nominated for an Oscar for ""Jackie Brown,"" playing a man at a crossroads. He's marvelous as a hard-working 56-year-old man who's seen it all, made his life choices, accepted what he has, and then falls hard for Grier.There are so many layers to the film and performances. The tone is laid back, natural, and conversational, and most of the acting is very underplayed. Jackson is great portraying an absolute horror show who bails people out so he can kill them before they give him up. DeNiro has only a few lines as Jackson's apparently easygoing, take it as it comes partner (and what comes at him is Bridget Fonda), shrugging and smoking pot through most of the film. Towards the end, he nearly steals the movie as his nerves creep up on him. It is an absolutely brilliant performance. Keaton is perfect as a hyper detective. But it's Grier, as a powerful, street-smart woman determined that she has had her last bad break, who captivates as Jackie Brown. The part is unusual, in that it's a lead role for a 44-year-old woman.Tarantino gives us the usual scenes shown from various characters' points of view, the violence you don't see coming, and a great sound track. Though not considered his best film, Jackie Brown is interesting, fun, and bittersweet. And hey, he gave some very good actors a second place in the sun.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Routine crime story with good acting,"Tarantino does a good job with Jackie Brown. There is action, some plot twists with cool music, quality directing and editing. I had only one problem. I recently saw Out of Sight (another film based on an Elmore Leonard novel) which was equally good in all these areas but had a much more interesting and unusual story.With its routine plot, Jackie Brown never left me in suspense or surprised me but I still enjoyed it. I owe this to its fine performances. Pam Greer is solid in the title role as the victim calling the shots. Samuel Jackson is terrific but may I suggest please lose the strange hair (which seemed left over from Deep Space Nine). But my favorite performance is by Robert Forster. He is tough and street wise but surprisingly he is not macho at all. Other supporting roles by Michael Keaton and Bridget Fonda were just fine.

And what a pleasure it is to watch something as wonderful as this after so many average films. Splendidly plotted, thanks to a large extent to the original Elmore Leonard book, Rum Punch, this traverses its considerable length with ease and panache. Once more I am struck just what fantastic performances QT seems to obtain. Pam Grier gives the performance of a lifetime (better even than her tremendous 1974 Foxy Brown turn) and she seems to grow in stature and presence as the film progresses. Robert Forster is perfect and a great balancing element between some towering and competing personalities. Robert DeNiro, of whom I am no great fan, here, surely gives his greatest ever performance and even Bridget Fonda is really good, bare feet and wiggly toes and all. Overall this may turn out to outlive the wonder of the latest film but for me, though this is still a stupendous film with great acting and good jokes it didn't have that 'makes me smile' factor the new film seems to have, for me anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
An amazingly cool film.,"First of all I am one big Tarantino fan always have been. Most people have criticized this movie as being his worst movie. That couldn't be further from the truth. Quentin takes Elmore Leonars novel Rum Punch and turns it into an amazingly cool film. Pam Grier is as foxy as she was in Foxy Brown and Samuel L. Jackson is a really good bad ass. Quentin gives this story is own spin with a great adaptation of the book and outstanding direction. Robert Forster gives a great performance as a bail bonds agent named Max Cherry. His performance actually surprised me considering he wasn't in much before this. The best actor in this film is by far Samuel L. Jackson, his character Ordell is perfect for him. I might even say that he is better in this than in Pulp Fiction. I think this movie is a great, foxy, cool mystery that deserves much more attention then it has received.

I liked how we saw different parts of the story over and over again from a different person's perspective. There wasn't that much action but the main story was pretty gripping and kept you guessing. Although it was gripping to an extent, I felt that it took too long to get going properly.

Under-rated Tarantino gem,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this Tarantino crime drama. Thinking back to the days of its original release, I don't remember much enthusiasm for this film. Yet, having watched it for the first time last night, I thought it was fantastic! It contained many of those retro Tarantino tricks that I love - the '70's soundtrack; the unexpected cuts and fades; the tricks with the time-line. The characters were fantastically portrayed for the most part - Samuel L. Jackson is a genius in this film as is DeNiro in his very understated role. In fact, this DeNiro character is unlike most others I can think of and in that sense, is sort of a relief. And Robert Forster captures the essence of Max the bail bondsman perfectly. This film lacks some of the wild pace and excessive violence of other Tarantino films. I find that a bit of a relief, too.

You won't recognize anyone.,"Having become a household name with ""Pulp Fiction"", Quentin Tarantino followed it up with the somewhat confusing - but definitely worth seeing - ""Jackie Brown"". As the title character, Pam Grier gets involved in a series of lowlife events in LA. That's a loose description, but you may have to see the movie more than once to really understand it (I only saw it once).I had never heard of Robert Forster before this movie came out, but he's quite impressive here as cop Max Cherry, trying to use Jackie to accomplish his goals. Possibly the most mind-blowing thing in the movie is Samuel L. Jackson's character Ordell Robbie. A low-level criminal with a pony-tail (yes, the silver screen's baddest motherf***er sports a pony-tail), he almost seems like the sort of person who should have been played by Denzel Washington - but make no mistake about it: Jackson does a good job with the role. It seems that Bridget Fonda's character didn't have much purpose of being in the movie; ditto Robert DeNiro's character. Michael Keaton's character is mostly interesting when you realize that this was his last good movie until ""White Noise"" last year.All in all, this isn't the Tarantino movie that I would recommend above all others, but it is worth seeing.

There's only a little bit of out-of-ordering sequence, but it comes together in a memorably well done heist scene. It runs a little bit on the long side, but it feels like a full experience. While having genuinely good storytelling, instead of being purely dramatic, it takes the unique route of being satire. The serious and comedic elements add to each other rather than take away.

This isn't a film where violence is played for laughs. Violence is fast. Bang! Over. Dead body on the ground.

Oh My God!,"I was so angry when I saw this one in the theater. Now I can just laugh at it. By and large, just overkill for Tarantino. Way too self absorbed. Perhaps he was over-thinking it? Perhaps he did way too much coke before doing this? I dunno. He had some good ideas, but he just couldn't deliver. There was one scene that worked for me. The exchange between Samuel Jackson and Chris Tucker. That was nice. It had some edgy realism that took you to another level. Some pure American street jive that portrayed hoods or gangsters, showing the gritty underbelly of America. And if Tarantino went that harsh realistic route it may have been a good movie; an interesting departure for Tarantino. But unfortunately after that scene it simply fell apart. He tried to do too much. The worst scene was the one in the mall where you had three different takes on one scene. A complete waste of time because it was a useless scene to begin with. If that isn't self gratuitous I don't know what is. And DeNiro. Man was he embarrassing! I don't think that was his fault. What the hell kind of character was that?? For such an accomplished actor too. On the other hand you give Pam Grier the lead? Bad choice QT.Oh well, you can forgive Tarantino for this one. Every director has a stink bomb.

this one merits another viewing...,"Jackie Brown deserves more credit than it often gets...If anything, it proves that Tarantino has a real knack for filmmaking, and that he isnt some indie fluke who made a couple masterpieces and then went downhill. What weve got here is a real piece of work. A film that is provacotive and entertaining, a film that features solid performances and skilled directing. Jackie Brown embodies the essence of a great film, and I will still stand by the claim I made when I first say the picture: If this came out before Pulp Fiction, in 1994, JACKIE would be viewed as Quentin's masterpiece.But of course as we all know, it followed in the wake of the Pulp madness, and that was perhaps the films death knell. To out-do Pulp would be impossible - it is the greatest film ever made, but I dont think Tarantino was trying to make a film that out did it, I think he was trying to make a film that he would enjoy if he happened to catch it at the cinema back in the 70's. Its fun and it moves at a more methodical pace than its two predecessors (Pulp and Reservoir Dogs), but dont be fooled, its still chock full of brilliant dialogue and inspired segments. Keaton turns in a great performance here, and it just goes to show that he is incredibly underrated. Robert Forster brings a dose of charming reality to the film and he brings a warm and comfortable presence to his charecter. Pam Grier approaches her role as Jackie with the same detached yet confident ""cool"" that made her a legend in stuff like ""Coffy"". She's great, and she really keeps you glued to her every move. DeNiro is DeNiro - he is a classic actor and this shows why. He can do it all. Honestly I this is his best work since Raging Bull.Jackie Brown is great, dont be told otherwise.

Tarantino's worst film,"Jackie Brown was not a bad movie, but just a disappointment, since I was expecting so much more from a Quentin Tarantino movie.  The movie still had the same style to it as all of Tarantino's other films, but the movie was a lot different and not as enjoyable as Tarantino's other films.  Of course, this movie was based on a novel, so Tarantino didn't write it, he just wrote the script.  The story is too drawn out, but the acting and directing are excellent, and there are a few very cool scenes that make the movie worth while.  Sam Jackson plays a very funny part, and it was fun to see Robert De Niro in a Tarantino film.  Both actors, as always, played their roles very well.  It was a treat to see Michael Keaton in the film, as well as Chris Tucker.  I'd rate Jackie Brown right beneath Kill Bill Vol. 2 as far as Quentin Tarantino films go.

Tarantino brings a toned down version of Pulp (re-review in 2010),"""One of her brothers was a bad outlaw..."" It was satisfying to see Jackie Brown on a big-screen, finally, as I had originally meant to see it when it came out in 1997. It also was fitting that the print of the film screened hadn't been updated or changed since 97, so there were parts that looked scratched and worn - ironically a Grindhouse-looking print for a QT movie that is the least Grindhouse-like movie he's made. The violence here, one of the things that people expect in his movies, is toned down; only once, when a particular character is killed in a car is it bloody or really shocking. The other few kills in the movie are off-screen or far away. That doesn't mean they don't have an impact - if anything, you feel it a bit more due to it popping out.The whole movie carries restraint to it, but this is a good thing. Tarantino isn't concerned so much with plot- though it has a kickin'-good yarn spun by Elmore Leonard to work off from - but with the characters, hanging out with them (he's said that it's ""his"" Rio Bravo - just chilling out with some guys who happen to be in a story with some danger and action to it, but more-so talking about what will happen and seeing how the dominoes fall).Another thing I noticed this time, after seeing the film so many times I've lost count (though it's less than the number of lost-count-times than Pulp Fiction, more than Reservoir Dogs), is how masterful Samuel L. Jackson is here. This may be my favorite performance from him, or at least the most he's given per capita seeming to do so little, as he exudes a brooding, intelligent menace for Ordell, a guy who is, if one has to pigeon-hole him, the 'villain' of the story. But he also epitomizes the gangster-style of the Wu-Tang song 'CREAM' (""Cash rules everything around me, cream, get the money, dolla dolla bill y'all"") and is serious as a heart attack about it.And yet he's not someone I outright hate as a villain or detest; he's like a cool-ass mother*****' snake who gets done what he had to get done, and is on top of everything until he isn't. Jackson makes the guy look cool, though dangerous, and he has especially great scenes in the final 20 minutes of the film where his ponytail hair is let down all like a crazy samurai and he gives his threats in a hushed tone to Robert Forster in the car. Really excellent work.Also reminded again: Pam Grier in a red dress. Oooh. Just saying.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Jackie Brown is more proof that Tarantino has a talent for walking that tightrope and pulling off the right tone. I think part of the genius lies in casting. With someone else in the lead role, Jackie Brown could come across as overly manipulative and mean-spirited. But Pam Grier has a charm that makes her actions seem justified and righteous. Samuel L. Jackson is also the perfect guy for the most dangerous man in the movie. He can have a number of aggressive rants without feeling like a ridiculous parody of a villain, and also laces those rants with a charm that makes it clear how he could become a successful businessman. This quality continues in the supporting cast as well, like Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, and even Chris Tucker.Despite all the positives this film has going for it, I had some issues with Jackie Brown. For starters, it feels a bit slow-paced and long. I don't typically notice the length of a Tarantino movie because I'm always on the edge of my seat waiting to see what will come next, but I was approaching boredom here. Also, I found Robert De Niro to be out of place or underused in the film. For a long time he's just a pointless character that tags along, and by the time he does anything of importance, he's out of the film seconds later. It also felt at times like Tarantino thought the plot was more clever than it was in reality. During one of the biggest scenes we have to rewind 3 times to show all the different angles of what happened, when I figured it out the first time through, so the movie was just idling in place for no good reason. There's no denying that Jackie Brown is a well-made film with some great moments, but it was lacking that extra special punch that it needed to knock me off my feet like some other Tarantino movies have done in the past.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good but not great.,"I unfortunately found myself bored throughout this movie. Although the characters were fairly interesting and it was a good script, it felt as if there was more here that was not being explored. Yet, it also felt too long. During certain scenes I felt myself losing focus due to sheer boredom. Only to come back and realize I hadn't missed anything of importance at all. I'm all for long movies, but this one falters in its length. Overall still worth the watch. Even though I wouldn't consider it one of my favourites.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Jackie Brown: 8/10,"Expectations ruin movies. I was talking to my brother about Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to Pulp Fiction. He said the movie ""bombed"" because people didn't think it was as good as Pulp Fiction and made less money. Although many were disappointed that it didn't rise to Pulp-like statue, and that it didn't make as much money as it (less than 20%), but does that automatically make Jackie Brown a terrible movie? No. On the contrary, it's a nice departure from the frenzied pace of Pulp, and shows Tarantino's growth in this medium.Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight attendant at a small airline. She works in transferring money via the airline, but soon she is caught. In order to reduce, or eliminate her sentence, she helps the police get Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson), an arms dealer, put away. However, with the help of bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), she starts to play both sides like a modern-day Yojimbo. Plus, Robert De Niro using a large bong!Tarantino takes a breather between Pulp and the Kill Bill movies here with a (for the most part) nonviolent drama. It's slow, but it's refreshing. In the age of quick cuts and techno music that's overused, it's good to see a film like this. The pace is slow, sometimes too slow for its own good, but it never gets boring or tedious. The movie does have a few stylish flairs, but it looks low budget, and feels low budget. This movie seems normal-none of the wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am dialogue that made Pulp so famous. There's almost no memorable dialogue in Jackie Brown, but does that mean that it's a terrible movie? According to many people, yes. In my opinion, no.The thing is, although Jackie is about 20 minutes too long, it's entertaining throughout. The script, based on Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch, keeps our interests throughout, mainly because of Pam Grier. Her endearing work makes the movie worth watching. Her no-holds-barred attitude in the movie makes it continually interesting. Jackson puts in an average show-nothing can top Jules Winnfield. De Niro looks like he's doing a favor for a friend-or Tarantino just wanted him in the movie. But chronically stoned Melanie (Bridget Fonda) put in a good job. The acting's not as good as previous Tarantinos, but for the most part, it's good.So, let me sum up everything I've said. Jackie Brown is an entertaining, long (by about 20 minutes), and enjoyable movie. See it.My rating: 8/10Rated R for strong language, some violence, drug use and sexuality.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A few douchebags rip off a bigger douchebag,"Not that much of a punch. The female protagonist is written well and strong, but isn't likeable. Likewise, Samuel's character is interesting, but repulsive. The rest of the characters are blank without much soul about them. The plot is very simple and they just care about some money. Pretty fun movie but that's all. Perhaps not rewatchable. Not much to say. Cya nerds.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pam Grier Should Have Been Nominated,"I just watched Jackie Brown for the first time in about 10 years.Unlike Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction this is told in chronological order. And whilst it lacks the wow of Pulp or the simplicity of Reservoir its a more mature movie. Tarantino shows he does not need to use violence to hold an audience. That is not to say there is no violence in the movie, there is, but there are only four deaths and you don't really see anything.Pam Grier is a joy, Samuel Jackson is great at delivering Tarantino dialogue. Michael Keaton is as great as he always is, as is Robert De Niro (but I'm not sure I could see Sly in the role, especially the scenes in the mall) but it's Robert Forster who was Oscar nominated. Personally, I think Grier should have been too.I like how Grier was cast in this, and certain changes were made (Her name in the novel was Jackie Burke and she was white) The director thought she was the best person for the role, so she got it, like with Morgan Freeman in The Shawdhank Redemption, he was supposed to be a white, red haired Irish guy, but Freeman was the best for the role.One thing I will never understand is why Max does not leave with her at the end.Jackie Brown grossed $39 million dollars (against a $12 million budget) at the domestic box office.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Paging Elmore Leonard,"That rarity of Tarantino films, more character than gore.Who would have ever thought it possible?The only reason Jackie Brown works, and works quite well, is that it's based on a novel by the late Elmore Leonard. Now, Leonard could go pretty medieval in his novels, but his characters always felt like real people, good 'uns and bad. The language coming out of their mouths sounded real.I saw Jackie Brown some 15 years ago, about the same time I saw Out of Sight, based on another Leonard work, and I thought the two made great bookends. They seemed to honor Elmore Leonard. Seeing the movies made me want to read more Leonard novels.Imagine my surprise when I found out that the Charles Bronson flick, Mr. Majestyk, was one of his. I love that movie, and it made me love it more.15 years after my viewing Jackie Brown, the story itself is pretty much gone, but I do recall that it was suspenseful, had interesting folks doing bad and not-so-bad things, and even had a smidgen of humor that didn't depend on John Travolta hitting a chuckhole and blowing some poor doofus' head off.I have not seen the Django thing or Kill Thrill Bill, 1-47, or Inglorious Remakes or the recent Hateful Hatful. If I want to participate in Tarantino's pornographic horror shows, I guess I should watch more, but why would I want to? He hit his high point with the film version of a pretty good crime novel, and all we can do now is bring a mop to the theatre to push around the blood sloshing off the screen.Gag.",,Anonymous,Crime
A solid 'Meh...',"Talk about a bloated film...By my reckoning, if all of the scenes in Jackie Brown that consist entirely of the following were cut, the film would be one hour shorter:A scene where someone is walking while allegedly cool 70's music plays in the background.A scene where someone is driving while allegedly cool 70's music plays in the background.A scene where someone is sitting while allegedly cool 70's music plays in the background.Etc, etc, etc.Aside from the film student style 'character studies', which largely consist of the above and make a person think that they too could make it big in Hollywood if this is what passes for a story, the movie is otherwise fairly blah... Simply put, not much actually happens.Jackie starts as a hot chick with moxie and ends as a hot chick with moxie.Bail Bondsman, Cherry starts as a guy smitten with Jackie and ends as a guy smitten with Jackie. (And oh, we know this because on meeting her for the first time, allegedly cool 70's music plays in the background as she walks towards him, and the audience wonders why a late-middle-aged white guy suddenly hears Motown - after all, the scene is shot from his perspective... or perhaps we're to believe Jackie just carries that soundtrack around with her...?)Bad guy Ordell starts as a untrustable thug and ends as a untrustable thug.Etc, etc, etc.I'd wager that if this had been QT's first film, it would have been his only film.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A good movie but not as good as it's director's reputation!,"Jackie Brown is a fine movie.Well adapted,well acted and well directed.It's interesting and not predictable,which is most important.However,i do feel that it misses that Tarantino's style.As we watch it it's obvious that this is not Tarantino's original work.His original screenplay.There are no dialog's and scenes which mark Tarantino as an outstanding director and a writer.It's a good movie,there is no question about it.It's just that...I don't know.It's just very noticeable that this is not his original writing.That's the main flaw in this movie.It just doesn't look's like it's his.But here is something to cheer you up,Robert De Niro was great as usual!He was really brilliant in this movie.I can tell you right now that you wont regret watching this movie.At least not as long as you forget the fact that it's Tarantino's!7/10.Enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pam is STILL the Queen!,"One of Quentin Tarantino's more mature outings, this is an engaging adaptation of the novel ""Rum Punch"" by Elmore Leonard. The filmmaker shows a typically masterful way of telling a story, except that, because he's working from someone else's source material, there's less self-indulgence on his part. He assembled one hell of an impressive cast here, and as usual his choice of music is pretty damn eclectic. ""Jackie Brown"" is an awfully long, seemingly unwieldy film at approximately two hours and 35 minutes, but it's always hip, and funny, and entertaining.Blaxploitation goddess Pam Grier got a long overdue comeback vehicle here, playing the title role. Jackie is an ageing flight attendant who also couriers money for gun running lowlife Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). Soon, she's caught in the act, and does an amazing job of manipulating both the detectives (Michael Bowen, Michael Keaton) on her case and Robbie himself, all in the name of keeping herself out of jail and on the job.Pam is a treat to watch, playing this very smart and very savvy person whom you just can't help but like. Also getting one of his best roles in ages is Robert Forster, as the lovestruck bail bondsman Max Cherry who's intrigued by her situation. The scenes with Pam and Forster are among the best in the film. Jackson is a lot of fun as the flamboyant criminal. The excellent ensemble extends to Robert De Niro, as Ordell's not too bright associate Louis, and Bridget Fonda, as the conniving surfer girl Melanie. Chris Tucker, LisaGay Hamilton, Tommy 'Tiny' Lister, Hattie Winston, and Aimee Graham co-star; it's especially delicious seeing Sid Haig, Pam's long ago co-star in exploitation features of the 1970s, cast as a judge.You know you're in for some good times when the opening credits are accompanied by Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street"". The cinematography by Guillermo Navarro and editing by Sally Menke are first rate. Although the pace is rather deliberate, things get more interesting towards the end as Tarantino shows climactic events occurring from a few different perspectives.Although Tarantino films often tend to get quite violent in an operatic sort of way, the violence here is more restrained, which may make ""Jackie Brown"" more accessible to people who ordinarily might find the directors' work somewhat off putting.This is a rock solid picture, one that's well worth seeing.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
An infinitely enjoyable experience.,"Despite the negative criticism this film has received, and claims that the shine has gone off Quentin Tarantino, Jackie Brown is still head and shoulders above most of what the movie business has to offer. As Tarantino said, the movie is not supposed to be an epic, rather a character study. It does not have the class and brilliance of Pulp Fiction, and the suspense of True Romance or Reservoir Dogs. The storyline in itself is nothing original. Yet what Jackie Brown has is amazingly real charachters and dialogue, interesting Tarantino situations and a stellar cast who perform it all to perfection. Samuel L. Jackson is awesome as a street-wise gunrunner - he won the best actor award at Cannes. Bridget Fonda is is dynamite as his stoned house-mate. Robert Forster received an Oscar nomination  for his role - perhaps the most natural, human performance I have ever seen, free from any Hollywood gloss. Robert DeNiro plays an unusual role for him - a quiet charachter, but plays it  to absolute perfection. Finally, Pam Grier is a sensation, a fresh face on the screen. All characters are complex and enticing. The movie is long, but you can hardly want it to end because it's a joy to watch.",,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino is losing it...,"Not that this was a bad movie...  I can't fault him on the semi-lackluster script because this story was adapted from a novel.  But it took him 4 years just to make Jackie Brown and now 5 to make Kill Bill?  If you've read the script for Kill Bill, there is a pretty good chance you are as disappointed as I am.HOWEVER Jackie Brown is NOT Dogs or Pulp Fiction so it should not be so closely compared to the other two.  It is well directed, well acted, (in the case of Pam Grier and Robert Forster, I found Sam Jackson's performance to be very annoying)and the music is very good.  On the other hand, the story, whether it was a novel or not, was not top rate.  The ending falls flat, there is no twist...but maybe that was the intention, I'm not sure. DeNiro didn't even need to be in this movie, it bothered me that he had such a meaningless role (in terms of DeNiro caliber roles, anyone his age could have played that part).  I'll give it a 7 though when all is said and done because of Pam Grier's performance and the soundtrack, and those two things put together make the movie interesting enough for me to watch and enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Very Watchable, A Different Shade of Tarantino","When I think of Tarantino's films, I think of strong gory violence, non-chronological order and very showy films. They tend to be very action dominant; Jackie Brown, however, is rather different.It still has killing but they are toned down. We do not see limbs being removed with samurai swords, blood spouting from every orifice or brain matter splattered all over a car.The film itself flows very well and has a good plot. I did however find it a little predictable at times but it was still an entertaining watch. The casting was good and managed to fit their characters very well.In summary, if you have seen pulp fiction et al and are expecting much of the same then think again, you will find probably find this film very bland. However, this film does provide an entertaining watch with a gripping story and is certainly not bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I like it!,"I really admire how flawed and relatable the characters are in Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown."" Take Max Cherry, for instance. He's not your typical slick gangster in a sharp suit; he's just an ordinary guy dealing with thinning hair. And Jackie Brown herself isn't some criminal mastermind; she's more about putting on a tough act before facing down a gun runner. Even Louis Gara's absent-mindedness when he forgets where he parked during a robbery makes him seem all the more human. These characters feel like people you might actually know.While Tarantino's later films are definitely praiseworthy, there's something special about embracing the humanity that shines through in ""Jackie Brown."" Sure, some viewers might have initially found it less flashy and intricate compared to ""Pulp Fiction,"" but Tarantino's choices in this film are just right. From the opening credits that echo ""The Graduate"" and give us a quick glimpse into Jackie's world to gripping moments like Ordell's confrontation with Beaumont, it's all on point. And let's not forget about that unforgettable kiss at the end of the film-not because it's super sensual, but because it's imperfect and real.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
In shadow of great predecessors,"Even a weaker Tarantino is still a good movie. For me, Jackie Brown is not one of the best works of him. Of course the movie has a hard time because it is inevitably compared to Tarantinos other works.The film has no length despite a running time of two and a half hours and is entertaining.

"A must-watch, even for non-Tarantino fans","Jackie Brown is probably the least Tarantin-esque film ever written or directed by Quentin Tarantino, mostly due to its chronological order of storytelling and lack of explicit violence. That said, it still retains many of his unique writing and directing features that have created such a large fanbase over the years.

A minor blip on an otherwise uninterrupted (upward?) trajectory,"This is my fourth Tarantino movie and I can confidently (unfortunately) say it comes bottom of the pile. What I've loved about Quentin's previous movies to this it that even if you get lost somewhere in the plot, there are always things going on to keep you entertained until you catch up. With this movie, however, he seems to have thrown that all away and focused on a story that tries to be too clever and kills itself by forgetting twists and turns aren't all should go into the movie. I'll admit I may not be the sharpest tool in the shed but I got confused to the point of frustration watching this movie. There are only so many times you can use the ""who's with who?"" thing before it gets boring and confusing, and Tarantino broke the record with this script. The music is another big letdown. Tarantino seems to have gotten too comfortable with the 70's black soul/funk genre, which results in an uninspiring, flat soundtrack. Even geniuses can't keep up the pace without fault forever, and Tarantino is no exception. I have my full faith that his next movie, or maybe even the one after that will be bigger, better, and badder.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Probably Tarantino's best.,"I'm not a real big fan of Quentin. Frankly, I see him as being one of the most overrated faces of Hollywood and the prince of swooping other people's ideas. That's just my opinion, but it's also many other's.Jackie Brown was workable for its decent finale. A wrap-up which is quite different from other Tarantino movies. You came away feeling satisfied with what happens to the characters. (Each one got whatever they deserved, in a good way or a bad way depending on who they were) And unlike other Tarantino movies, the characters here were richly textured, and much more believable then the foul mouthed, Lee-Marvin luvin' thugs in the ladder.Pam Grier makes a wonderful comeback as a Flight Attendant who is caught smuggling coke and a half a million of her boss' money. The boss is Samuel L. Jackson, who was so despisable and evil as the illegal arms dealer that anyone else in the movie was pixy dust. If she helps the bust, there's immunity on the deal.Not a perfect movie, but the performances were very good. Overall, nice adaption of Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch.""",,Anonymous,Crime
Both underrated and overrated,"""Jackie Brown"" is one of the most divisive Tarantino films: it gets either praised as his masterpiece or bashed for being too dull.I understand both points of view: Tarantino's trademark style reaches its technical maturity here in many aspects, but it's indeed rather sluggish and toned-down compared to his most famous works. It's a film that takes its time and focuses on the characters rather than the situations, telling us the story of a bunch of worn-out, middle-aged half-assed criminals (well, that was quite a series of hyphens).It might be a bit wordy and overlong, but the mood makes it a pleasure to watch. Stylistically a personal homage to blaxploitation, as the tasteful use of the music and the title screen suggest (the ""Jackie Brown"" logo looks exactly the same as ""Foxie Brown"", also starring Pam Grier).Tarantino again managed to put together a great cast, except for maybe De Niro, who didn't seem to blend in well with the other characters (it might be due to the bland role he got). I personally loved Samuel Jackson, Bridget Fonda, and Robert Forster the most here.Either underrated or overrated, but personally a just fine film without high or lows.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The smartest ones don't always win out.,"After a ground-breaking, eye-opening success like Pulp Fiction, any director would feel pressured to make a film that establishes them as a genuine talent rather than a flash in the pan. I'm not sure that is what Quentin Tarantino attempted to do with Jackie Brown, but he makes it work in every way possible. As his only film not originally written but based on an Elmore Leonard novel, the film has a very novel-like structure. There are also quite a bit of main players, to a degree even more so than Pulp Fiction because here they are part of the intricate and complex plot rather than supporting characters thrown in for some enjoyable banter.It is interesting to see the evolution of Tarantino's ability to direct a film between Pulp Fiction and this. One feels like a young, up and coming director full of ambition and energy, ready to show the world what he can do. The other is much more restrained, professional and interested in the deeper realms of these characters. Indeed, throughout his career it is obvious that Tarantino's gifts lie with dialogue and characters; for him they go hand-in-hand.To go along with that is a terrific cast. Pam Grier, an icon of the blaxploitation films of the 1970s, looks tired and weary of the cards life has dealt her as the title character, a flight attendant who gets mixed up with smuggling money and the ATF, putting her in a position she would rather not be in but understands the long-term significance. Samuel L. Jackson gives perhaps the best performance as Odell, a mean, driven criminal willing to go to any lengths to ensure his status. Robert Forster revived his career as Max Cherry, a bail bondsman with a lot in common with Jackie and willing to help her out. However, my personal favorite must be the great Robert De Niro as Louis, a former cell mate of Odell who is more than a little unable to work his way back into society after being released from prison. The way De Niro plays the character so subtly stupid and ignorant is both hilarious and shocking to watch.Of course, with any Tarantino film, the plot doesn't matter so much as who's in it. The film is long but never boring as he winds up this intricate story of crossing and double-crossing all while sneaking in scenes contemplating heavier themes like age and life's direction. This is certainly a film that will catch people by surprise, especially Tarantino fans who loved Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The classic Tarantino signs are here, but there's also a lot more under the surface.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Endearing,"There a great deal in Jackie Brown (JB) that has the potential to warm the cockles of a movie-lover's heart.First, it's simply a well, well constructed flick. If you love solid filmic storytelling, you'll marvel at the conception and execution.There's a kind of built-in wonderment at the release of JB relative to Tarantino's earlier work. It doesn't pack the same kind of punch as Dogs or Pulp. But the punch it *does* pack is no less significant... and the contrast is appreciated.The characters are fantastic studies in character. In a nutshell, JB is (among other things) a kaleidoscopic bestiary of sociopathy. I don't think it's a spoiler to advise that, as you take stock of these various nuances and degrees of criminal mind, you should cast your net very widely: Perhaps only the cops come anywhere near to being truly morally clean--remember that as you're watching the concluding action.Tarantino's penchant for dusting off and deploying yesteryear's faces is very well served in JB. Forster is an absolute delight.Speaking of cutting edge casting, Tarantino's against-type and subtle direction of heavy-hitters like DeNiro and Tucker (especially the former) is a joy to see. DeNiro takes direction humbly and very well to create a truly DUMB persona. Louis is loyal, dutiful, not-without some moments of rugged sagacity... but slathered over it all is a translucent sauce of unfortunate, dogged dimness. And it's all nicely integrated in a superb character and narrative mix.And there's more! I could go on! But I won't. Watch it.I give it a '9' because the profound mythic dimensions of Pulp Fiction sort of set a high bar.But don't judge JB too harshly on those terms.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Everything in place but the magic - 73%,"For many years, this was the big one - the one that got away. As much as I enjoy Tarantino's movies, this one never really seemed to bother me much and so I was happy to give it a miss. I even bought it on DVD and traded it before I watched it. So using the benefits of a Sky+ box, I could finally give it a fair hearing but after all this time and given the fact that it is the follow-up to one of my favourite films of all time, could it really hope to compete?Taking his cue from riffing off other genres, ""Jackie Brown"" is Tarantino's take of Seventies blaxploitation and introduces us to airline stewardess Jackie (Pam Grier), who should be doing better but finds herself increasingly held back by past mistakes. Her other source of income is running money for arms dealer Ordell (Samuel L Jackson) but things are about to take a turn for the worst. After being busted by ATF agent Nicolette (Michael Keaton), Jackie finds herself caught up in their plan to catch Ordell or face a long stretch behind bars. Trouble is, anyone double-crossing Ordell ends up dead pretty quick. But Jackie is a resourceful woman and begins making plans of her own, possibly involving her bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster)...There is technically nothing wrong with ""Jackie Brown"". Performances are universally brilliant - even Chris Tucker's brief appearance isn't annoying - and almost as good as the funk and soul mix of the soundtrack featuring legends like Bobby Womack, the Delfonics and Randy Crawford. The soundtrack, you expect to be faultless in a Tarantino flick but his usual antics of playing with the chronology are kept to a strict minimum which means any who didn't get ""Pulp Fiction"" will not be confused by the plot here. The story, based on an Elmore Leonard novel, has the usual twists and turns but ultimately doesn't offer too much in the way of surprises which felt a little disappointing. But in truth, this is a great crime movie with brilliant performances and all to a fantastic soundtrack. What's not to like?Well, Tarantino's films have a reputation for being close to the edge, for pushing boundaries and taking things to the extreme but ""Jackie Brown"" is none of this things. It feels too safe by Tarantino's standards as if he's afraid of offending anyone and as a result, it lacks the usual zing and verve of his other films. And while it keeps the Seventies vibe going, I never personally felt it was a blaxploitation tribute as strongly as ""Pulp Fiction"" paid homage to crime thrillers. I wanted to be gripped but I only stuck with it for fear of losing the plot. It's an easy film to admire but a difficult one to love and to be honest, I just didn't feel the magic.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Federals, Guns and Money","After listening to the interesting movies podcast ""The Plot Thickens"" season on actress Pam Grier, (and what an interesting life she's led!) this Quentin Tarantino movie seemed the most attractive option for me to witness her work. I haven't watched any of her Blaxploitation-heyday movies before, or actually any other of them, barring ""Shaft"", although I love the musical soundtracks they inspired, so this homage to the genre by QT seemed like the best way in, although I'm not the world's biggest Tarantino fan either and haven't seen many of his movies to date.But I did enjoy the movie. For me it nailed the era in all its big-car, trash-talking, bad-fashion, randomly violent glory, if that's the right word, and yes it benefits from selecting the cream of the best music from the times as its soundtrack too, the latter avoiding big names of the time like Curtis, Stevie and Marvin to name but three in favour of prominently featured tracks by the likes of The Delfonics and Bloodstone.Grier stars in the title role as the barely subsisting middle-aged air-stewardess working for a crummy airline, who out of financial need (and past experience obviously) is tempted back into being a mule for Samuel L Jackson's crazy-wigged, crazy-bearded gun-running overlord Ordell Robbie.Most of Robbie's super-stash is in Mexico and he wants to now bring it into the country to spend it, which is where Jackie comes in, only the plan goes awry when she's picked up by the Feds at the airport, Michael Keaton and Micheal Bowen. They want to use her to nail Ordell and start to pressurise her accordingly. Of course she's initially in jail on remand until Ordell uses bail bondsman Robert Forster's Max Cherry to get her out so that he can coerce her into making his big score. We've already seen how ruthless Ordell has been in ruthlessly disposing of one of his minions but now he's running about with Robert De Niro's stoner-goon Louis Gara to whom he introduces his white-trash live-in girlfriend Melanie played by Bridget Fonda. Meantime Jackie and Max click over a Delfonics track and she starts her own scheming to stay safe, avoid jail and cash-in all at once.It all hinges on a cash-drop by Jackie in the changing room of a plush fashion store, involving Gara and Melanie with Max apparently a coincidental casual observer and the Feds waiting in the wings. Tarantino then does his familiar multi-perspective, time-messing thing before bringing the whole shebang in for a bumpy landing.Like I said I thoroughly enjoyed the evocation of the era, the larger-than-life characters, their rapid-fire vernacular dialogue, despite the overuse of the ""n"" word and especially the intricate plotting. Grier is excellent as the resourceful Ms Brown, Forster the same as the road-weary bondsman, Jackson is naturally in his element as the hair-trigger, fashion-disaster Robbie and De Niro as ever chameleons easily into his hash-pipe guzzling lackey role but who also turns out to be borderline psychotic just like his new boss.Stylishly directed with typical panache by Tarantino, he utilises his ensemble cast to fine effect seasoning the pot as ever with dark humour and acts of random violence.Didn't he blow my mind this time, well maybe not quite, but it's certainly one cool movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Simple but effective,"Compared to Tarantino's more bombastic, more outrageous flicks, this is like very subtle. As a film it's not at all, but just compared to his filmography. I can see why many would rate it among his lessor efforts, but I thought it was particularly engaging and well-paced. It's still definitely a crime film but one can see the disappointment in those people who wanted more of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction-like levels of intensity and narrative. The performances here are solid (although Jackson continue to stay in the same comfort zone that he's always good at, even if unoriginal). This is probably middle of the pack for me, but sort of underrated",,Anonymous,Crime
"Tarantino, but not quite","Out of all Tarantino's movies, this is by some distance his least Tarantino-esque. Forget excessive violence and cursing, random, endless dialogue, multiple storylines, non-linear narrative, overly stylish and irresistably cool storytelling, cartoonishly erratic characters. Well, there is some of all of that, but it's a healthy dose that is used effectively and serves a purpose.Instead, Jackie Brown takes a more traditional route, as it stays tight and focuses on its plot. It takes its time and builds up nicely. Also, its main character is arguably the most relatable and down to earth character of any Tarantino movie. Jackie Brown is a middle-aged black woman, tired, feeling the clock ticking. Add the interracial romance, which unfolds in a subtle and delicate way and you have a character that isn't on the spotlight that often. She has trouble with the law and tries to pull off a magic trick, escaping from the police, from her criminal ""boss"" and running away with the money. The movie shows us how this plan is carried out and all the complications that emerge.A big highlight is the ""exchange"", the main event of the movie and it's done exceptionally, as we get to see it from three different perspectives. The only complaint would be that it acts as a climax and comes too early. On the other hand, this choice adds realism, as that's how real life plays out, it's not like the movies.Another major strength of the movie is the casting. Pam Grier is too tired to deal with any nonsense, all the wear and tear is catching up and she will get what she wants. Robert Forster has so much street wisdom that it's hard to get moved by anything. However, after meeting Jackie a small crack appears and a glimpse of sensitivity just barely gets out. Bridget Fonda is busy wearing a bikini and getting high, but there is more than meets the eye, a pleasantly surprising performance. Samuel Jackson is memorably over the top, while Robert De Niro shows the toll prison takes on a man, though he admittedly could have have a bigger part.And of course you can always count on Tarantino to hit you with a great, '70s inspired soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
a rare occurrence in film,"While it may not have as many bodies hitting the floor as pulp fiction or kill bill this story was more subtle and believable than any other Tarantino film I've ever watched. I wouldn't normally give such a high rating for a film but I wanted to reward this movie for not having one thing that really bugged me or that I felt was just terrible or out of place. This film keeps getting better every time I watch it and that's something (at least to me) worth holding on to. I understand every movie isn't for everyone but if you're a fan of Tarantino, Blaxploitation films or any of the principle actors I would say this movie is at least worth 45 minutes of your time. If you can watch that much and it doesn't pique you interest then fair enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Just when you thought it couldn't get any better, it actually didn't but it couldn't have come closer.","Tarantino is quoted to have said, when asked about his follow up to Pulp Fiction which caused shock waves throughout the industry and how he would match it, that he knew he couldn't go over Pulp Fiction; so he went under it. In Jackie Brown, Tarantino pulled off from that very sentence what he set out to do. The film is a quite simplistic and laid back experience for most of the time, only branching off at certain points with that distinct flair Tarantino brings to his films when it needs to. This is most evident during the actual trading of bags in the shopping mall, something Tarantino announces is about to happen with a title card and a cheeky fourth wall breaking comment: 'For real this time'.But leading up to this heist or exchange or whatever is a thoroughly rewarding and distinct journey littered with realism; menace; great dialogue; great acting and individual personas for each of the characters. Given that Tarantino includes characters in Jackie Brown of the stoner, surfer bimbo and flight attendant variety and for him to make them come across as anything but the clichés and caricatures we have become to associate with them is a triumph in itself. Part of this is down to casting; having De Niro play Louis, a bank robber recently out of jail and addicted to drugs is one thing but resisting casting a young man in the role and resisting having him talkative and naïve in that 'stoner' caricature we could all associate with him is another. If anything, Louis could take the drugs to keep him calm since the instant we see him spending long amounts of time away from the pad and away from the drugs, he becomes very irritable and somewhat dangerous.Then you have the other 'types' that could so easily have been typecast but people like ATF enforcer Ray Nicolette (Keaton) is more than a typical policeman or agent with a badge and an ego, he wants to help Jackie and at certain points wants to get to know her whilst carrying a certain quirkiness attributed to Keaton's approach to the character. So if Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs were all about breaking down stereotypes in a well worn genre then Jackie Brown is the continuation of this, albeit on a lower scale. The film could fall into crime, possibly even neo-noir and quite possibly romance. There are some blurry lines as to who is playing the protagonist in the noir-inspired sense as bail bondsman Max Cherry (Forster) could clearly be given the 'down on his luck' lead role and Jackie the femme fatale or Cherry could simply be labelled an ally and Jackie (who's equally down on her luck) is the anti-hero playing everyone off against each other. The film is named Jackie Brown after all, but if we can learn anything from the final scene and garner anything from the film overall then it's feasible Max is the best and most interesting character.Jackie Brown is perhaps the most conventional of Tarantino's films; certainly at the time and certainly with hindsight also. It adopts a straight and linear path that only become complicated when it branches off to show its several primary characters' actions. In terms of manipulating the linear passage of things, Jackie Brown rarely toys with formula until it is absolutely necessary to drop the viewer into chaos of the mind as they frantically backtrack and work out who's where and why they might be. This is done during the most important scene in the film and feels like the climactic heist as everything comes together and fits into place but really, Tarantino is using it as a set up for the bigger picture; the attempted acquiring of a gun runner.At the core of the film is a strong female character and how often can you come away saying there is such a thing in a film that contains gun runners; stoners and could quite feasibly fall into the noir genre? Incidentally when Max first sees Jackie, played by Pam Grier, leaving the jail house his look is constructed around the gaze theory but one thing I noticed that may be deliberate by Tarantino is that she isn't fetishised or presented in an objective fashion. This is down to two things; firstly Tarantino places her about two dozen feet away from the watching Max and secondly, given the dystopian locale of the jail house we've previously been presented with, Jackie has this aura about her that does not demand an attractive labelling. She is a mess, with scraggly hair; well worn clothes; air miles under her belt for that particular day and generally unglamorous.Following her brush with death at the hands of gunrunner Ordell Robbie (Jackson), who is equally brilliantly set up in all his ruthless glory, the film divulges into the seedy world of apartments bought with blood money, malls, mall car parks and police station offices. The splashes of Tarantino are evident in random flashes of violence; eventual non-linear story telling and a mock cartoon bird's eye view of a flight from Mexico to America. The soundtrack of light, mellow love songs adds a depth to Jackie Brown as Max gently eases his way into feeling for the woman as the meetings escalate between the two. The manner in which each character is fleshed out in their own retrospect's and the efficiency of most scenes involving Jackson's Ordell Robbie as well as Cherry's gradual relationship with Brown are some of the reasons Jackie Brown goes down as and will remain as one of my favourite films.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The Worst of Tarantino, but still decent","The film definitely has its moments. I love Pam Grier in it, her smile is just awesome. Music is great, Sam Jackson is Sam Jackson. Robert Forrester is the man. Bridget Fonda is sexy. And Micahel Keaton is an added treat. I also love how much the mall features in the film. That said, DeNiro is wasted in the film (in more ways than one) and the plotline just sort of slugs along. It's not a very compelling story and the dialoug seems forced at times. Overall, the movie seems like Tarentino needed to put out a movie after the success of Pulp Fiction and he rushed this out. Of the 9 QT films, this one is definitely my least favorite, but still watchable. QT is still the man.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Quentin, you owe us an apology","When first hearing of this title, you would of expected another Pulp Fiction. Sadly here you;re very mistaken. You've been very short changed I'm afraid. Working from Elmore Leonard's novel, Quentin must of been self conscious in his telling of this nothing impressive tale. There's hardly any Tarantino humor or VIOLENCE. We have a few stretched out scenes, wasted ones, of little significance, ones that take place in Jackson's Venice beach apartment. We can tell he's held back here, as if to honor or not disrespect crime author, Leonard's book. Pam Grier playing the title, one of the many great performances, is a 44 year old black woman trying to make ends meat, by earning her undeserved share of money made off selling guns, that her boss, Ordell Robbie sells. Jackson is fun to watch in this, playing bad good, in reverse to the much gentler and reserved teacher he played in 187. When Grier is arrested by the feds, she has her own way of snaking out of it, outwitting authorities, while hatching a plan to rip off Ordeal. You gotta admire the courage and strength of the character, but the storytelling just seems to be prolonged. There's not many surprises in the thriller department either. We know what each character wants, whether he/she is good or bad. They're an open book. Deniro was fun to watch as as ex parolee friend of Jackson, who lags around in Jackson's apartment with skinny bikini bodied pot smoking Mel (Fonda). Her murder in the car park was a shock. On the whole Jackie Brown was a bitter disappointment when seeing it in the cinema. This disappointing feature almost had me wondering if I was in the right cinema. I enjoyed it more second time around on video, but this Tarantino flick is a two an hour flick that could of easily been told in 90 minutes. It's just a prolonged story with a lot of flat, not much happening scenes. If Tarantino did it his way, minus Leonard's' influence, we would of had a better movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pam Grier terrific,Flight attendant Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) smuggles money from Mexico to Los Angeles for gun runner Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson).

Ordell intends to kill her but she comes up with a better scheme to help him smuggle out money and pay her for any jail time.Quentin Tarantino fills this movie with compelling characters played by charismatic character actors. Pam Grier makes a terrific step up. The plot is stuffed beyond what's necessary. It's a bit too long. I would like it to be tighter and more tense although Tarantino loves to fill up the in between scenes. It never drags and it's all very interesting.

Plot-heavy but occasionally meandering; decent characters make this worthwhile viewing.,"'Jackie Brown (1997)' is plot-heavy but occasionally meandering, one of the only Tarantino flicks to be based on pre-existing material - which is probably why it contains more of a story than most of his other work.

Tarantino's most layered movie to date,"(89%) If ever there was ever a movie that needs to been seen more than once, then this is it. Of all Quentin's films this has the keenest attention to character, as unlike a lot of movies that have hardly one dimension to the main role, this gives a past, a present, and a future to almost the entire line up, as this is as much Ordell's (Jackson) or Max's (Forster) movie as it is Jackie's (Grier). I can understand why there's a few people out there that don't really like this entry as after the tough and memorable ""Reservoir dogs"", and the brilliant vibrancy of ""Pulp fiction"" many movie goers were expecting yet more again, and what they got was a hugely talky, slower paced piece that didn't feel like it was getting anywhere soon. But this is something that grows on you the more you watch it, as I must have seen it about four times now and I pick up new things I hadn't even noticed because there's just so much to it. It really is something you can watch every 18-20 months on a cycle. Performance wise this is quite brilliant, nobody is making up the numbers, everyone is on top form, and even though Grier is known as an exploitation star she has always been a good actress, and here she is faultlessly natural. Of all Tarantino's movies, this is the one to buy and keep forever.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not Tarantino's Best Effort,"Following mega-hits (especially back-to-back mega-hits like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction) is bound to be a tough job. If Reservoir Dogs didn't cross your path back when it first came out, Pulp Fiction would've and, by the time Quentin Tarantino began working on his third film, it's only inevitable that people would compare whatever we would go on to do with his two previously established hits. Perhaps as a response, he decided to make Jackie Brown, which goes in a different direction entirely.
As has already been said here on IMDb, this film is much more ""mature"" than anything else Tarantino's done, which could've worked in his favor. This movie, however, is a major slow-burn that really starts to drag before the halfway point.
A lot of people adore this film - would, in fact, place it on a pedestal as being Tarantino's best film - but it just wasn't for me. It wasn't a bad movie by any means, but it was a major disappointment to follow up the prior two films. This particularly story could've been justifiably told in a 90 minute window as opposed to the ass-numbing 154 minutes that is Jackie Brown.I still maintain that Quentin Tarantino hasn't ever made a ""bad"" film, because ""bad"" this film is not.

Among Tarantino's Best,"A lot of people sleep on ""Jackie Brown."" I find it very enjoyable and entertaining. Quentin Tarantino brings his signature memorable and quotable dialogue and his climactic violent endings here. It's much more laid back and slower paced than his more explosive films like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Inglorious Basterds"", but I would rank this among my top three favorites of his. I honestly like it better than ""Reservoir Dogs"", as crazy as that might sound to some people. ""Jackie Brown"" reflects a more mature and thought-out side of Tarantino that wasn't present in his first two films, which allows for better written characters and more character development. I don't think it matches with ""Pulp Fiction"" in terms of memorability or impact, but it is a very underrated gem.Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Robert Forster, and Michael Keaton are all great here. The cinematography is marvelous. It pays homage to blaxploitation and 60s and 70s pulp cinema in a way that will delight many fans with eclectic tastes.My major gripe is that it does drag a bit in the middle while the plot unravels and we get a better sense of where we're going.

TARANTINO'S TRUE MASTERPIECE & ROBERT FORSTER IS OUTSTANDING!!!,"Jackie Brown is an absolutely BRILLIANT Crime Thriller, Tarantino created a gripping, intelligent, exciting, funny & totally entertaining piece of pulp cinema & my personal favourite Tarantino film, This crime Thriller is right up there with his other classic films ""Reservoir dogs"" & ""Pulp fiction"" the 90's were the best for Tarantino's genius.
The pairing of B-movie & low rent films of the past legends Pam Grier & Robert Forster is phenomenal, it's PERFECT casting so thank you mr. Tarantino for bringing back two of the underrated greats of past cinema, the whole movie relies on the romantic chemistry between ""Grier & Forster"" & it's completely perfect.
Just the nice scenes of these two veteran actors together sitting & having Coffee & chatting are such comforting scenes, the way Max looks at Jackie when he's at her apartment & she puts on some music, beautiful touching & natural character moments, Tarantino is a genius at this, just letting you hang out with the characters & become comfortable with them like you would with real friends, Tarantino gave us a real gift with JACKIE BROWN!!!!Jackie Brown is a character piece as well as his true masterpiece, Tarantino has put interesting characters on screen & gets the viewer to hang out with them & it becomes a comfort seeing these great characters again each time you watch it & that's incredible.
From the amazing opening scene with the Awesome song playing ""Accross 110th street"" it's one of the Coolest films ever made, easily the best Tarantino film in my opinion!!!
Also the look & cinematography is gorgeous this is superb film making at it's best!!!!
The dark humour is hilarious & the dialogue is witty,smart,humorous & great.
Samuel l Jackson is fantastic & gives one of his best performances!!!
Robert Forster is truly Mesmerising on screen, easily one of the greatest performances in cinema history!!!
Jackie Brown has become my favourite Tarantino movie & that's mainly due to the incredible performance from ""ROBERT FORSTER"" & this movie introduced me to him & made me a fan of his & got me searching out his back catalogue of his movie career, Forster has such a great screen presence as an actor,
He is rugged world weary & full of heart but
he's got a sadness in his eyes & a rugged natural Coolness, he puts a depth into his characters, a seriousness that makes him so interesting to watch, he's truly one of the best actors in the history of Cinema in my opinion!!!
Max Cherry is one of my favourite movie characters ever, Max is the type of world weary-seen it all & survived it all kind of guy you would want as a friend, he's wise & smart & a good man.
Forster always gives a solid performance even if he has a small role in a Little B-movie, there's a richness to the veteran actor on screen that can't be matched!!!
Forster is the kind of blue collar ""working actor"" who turns up in lots of movie's, mainly B-movies & low rent Thrillers but is always very good no matter what small role he may have had, he's like the great ""Tom Atkins"" in that respect or even the excellent ""Robert Davi"" as each guy is a good solid character actor on screen & brings their own unique acting style & screen presence & that's why these guys have huge ""cult following"" later in their careers, the ""cult status"" is for cool dudes like these & ""Robert forster"" is easily one of the best out there!!!""Brown"" is not a blood-soaked ultra violent film like ""Fiction"" or ""dogs"" it's a slower paced character driven drama-thriller with a beautiful heartwarming centre, that centre is the two ageing & lonely unlikely kind of couple in ""Jackie Brown"" & ""Max Cherry"", it's the heart of this crime caper.Jackie Brown has definitely become a favourite of mine now (It's entered my all time top 20 films list) ""Brown"" grew on me the most as i used to like it & always loved pam & forster in it but i used to think this was Tarantino's most boring film, but hey i was only a teen then so i couldn't understand the richness of the characters & the excellent story telling until i was older & now it's my favourite of his movies!!!
I rediscovered the genius of ""Jackie Brown"" & fell in love with it.The heart of this gripping crime Thriller is the sweet unsaid love story of Jackie Brown & Max Cherry, it unfolds beautifully & never fully blossoms but it's there.The cast & performances are truly fantastic here in Jackie Brown, i mean we have the legendary Pam Grier, Robert De niro, Samuel l Jackson, Bridget Fonder, Michael Keaton & Robert forster!!!
This is a standout ensemble cast & Pam & forster give the greatest performances of both their careers!!!Max Cherry (Forster) is my favourite character from the universe of Tarantino, i think ""roberts"" performance is one of the greatest in cinema history & he got a nomination!!!
I'm thankful for ""Tarantino"" introducing Robert forster & Pam Grier to me with this film, this film also resurrected Forsters career & got him the attention he deserves as a respected veteran actor.
Pam Grier is TRULY outstanding as ""Jackie Brown"" she gives the film a higher feel of quality & her BRILLIANT performance is mesmerising, she made an incredible lead along with ""Forster"" & it's the best I've ever seen her.The music is beautiful throughout & the scenes are crafted with a special song thats specific to that moment, it's Tarantino's genius again at work.
Jacke Brown is a fantastic movie & is as good as pulp fiction & reservoir dogs & that's how great a filmmaker Tarantino is!!!
Tarantino is one of the greatest directors of all time.
Reservoir dogs 10/10
Pulp fiction 10/10
Jackie Brown 10/10

slow paced but on the whole decent,"As a fan of all QT's work up to this point, back in 1997 I eagerly anticipated Jackie Brown's release. It didn't live up to the high expectations but in fairness you cant expect all his work to be five star classics.This movie was made at a time when all of Hollywood were falling over themselves to be in a Tarantino film and Jackie Brown certainly has a star studded and able cast. Robert Forster and Keaton in particular stand out in their supporting roles. Jackson gives his usual consistent performance as the villain of the piece but one thing that really Irked me about This film is the number of time Samuel L mentions the N-word. Here we must be talking treble figures and in this instance I found it really annoying and unnecessary. Pam Grier gets the lead role and makes a commendable fist of it. De Niro gets in on the act as a low-life career criminal-scumbag type character but we don't see much of him, ditto Bridget Fonda who is mostly seen lounging around her apartment in a bikini smoking weed.Good marks for an elaborate & original storyline and well-executed script throughout. I felt some of the scenes were overly slow and ponderous in places, but all things considered there is enough here to keep the viewer captivated. I give Jackie Brown a solid 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another Tarantino Triumph,"Tarantino once again writes and directs superbly in this gangster style crime thriller. With half a million dollars in cash as the prize, an air stewardess (Pam Grier) a gun runner (Samuel L Jackson) a bail bondsman (Robert Forster) an ex-con (Robert De Niro) a cop (Michael Keaton) and stoned beach bunny (Brigette Fonda) are all out to con one another and get their hands on the cash.The dialogue is very slick and clever throughout, and although its loaded with vulgarity; it works brilliantly.The characters are very diverse and each one is fascinating to watch, due to the great acting and the strong script.The direction equals all of Tarantino's previous work, and it blends the characters nicely into the story with craft.The story is a great slant on a commonly used theme, with more than enough twists and surprises to keep it stylish and fresh.Compared to Tarantino's other work, there is a noticeable reduction of violence in this movie, but it doesn't have a degenerative impact on the movie as a whole.Overall, Tarantino has done it again, its probably not quite as effective as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but it certainly doesn't fail to entertain for a moment.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Different kind of masterpiece from Tarantino.,"Okay, I have to admit I was one of those people who called ""Jackie Brown"" a bad movie around the time of its release. I thought it was overlong, uninteresting, dull and not nearly containing enough violence and spectacular gimmicks. That has changed with a couple of repeated viewings over the years. Admittedly ""Jackie Brown"" is an unusual film at first, especially when you expect to see another ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs"", but Tarantino's versatile brilliance still quickly shows through the staggering dialogs and masterful character drawings. The script is an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel called ""Rum Punch""  and a very faithful one, I've heard  but the elaboration of the characters and creating the atmosphere of coolness is pure and genuine Tarantino. He squeezes the most out of his already super-talented cast members and, for once, also indicates the viewer right from the start that this will be a slow-paced and story-driven type of thriller this time. I'm usually not a fan of long movies but the two and a half hours of Jackie Brown always literally fly by, since it's a joy and pleasure to observe Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Michael Keaton and all the other cast members in the roles of their lives. Jackie Brown is a middle-aged airline stewardess working for a lousy minimum wage and making some extra cash on the side by smuggling for the relentless gun trader Ordell Robbie. When she gets caught, she and the charming bail bounder Max Cherry develop a plan where they play Ordell and his criminal posse against the tough cops led by special agent Ray Nicolette. Trust me, the plot is far more convoluted and extended than this and it's definitely worth discovering the details for yourself if you haven't already. Many fans and internet sources state that ""Jackie Brown"" is one giant homage to the ""Blaxploitation"" trend of the early 70's. Well, it's true... but only partially. The smooth atmosphere (with the awesome soul soundtrack) and decorative elements are definitely heavily influenced by this particular cinema trend (and of course the casting of Pam Grier and Sid Haig as well), but the actual story is far too sober and even too mature to be Blaxploitation. Tarantino for once didn't deliver a rough and provocatively violent film, but this different type of approach is definitely rewarding since he managed to make a different type of masterpiece: one with heart, beauty, intellect and passion.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Far from Tarantino's best work, but there are some special acting performances which make this a worthwhile film, although it does not qualify as a ""must see.""","It's difficult to distance ""Jackie Brown"" from the earlier works of director Quentin Tarantino.  Compared to ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" it falls down at least a couple of pegs.  Tarantino's characters usually live in the criminal fringe of society, but most can evoke some sympathy from an audience.  This was not true of ""Jackie Brown"" at least not for me.  In the title role, Pam Grier gives us very little outside of attitude ... she might be in trouble, but she's not taking anyone's guff ... and I didn't feel that was enough.  I don't think you can base a quality film on someone whose only obvious attribute is that she can vamp through an airport like Tina Turner (who, by the way, would have been a better fit for the character).  Robert Forster, as the bail bondsman, gave an excellent performance.  He validated Grier's character by subtly playing off her affected sassiness.  Forster gave the audience a character to cheer for.  Samuel L. Jackson made a terrific villain, but I couldn't stand that little braid he had growing off his chin (was that supposed to be a beard?).  Robert Deniro showed, once again, why he is one of the best-paid stars in Hollywood.  He played the part of a basically useless thug, a man without a conscience or charm, but made him funny and charming, in a brutish kind of way.  Deniro made the character interesting, even though it was only a small part.  They should show clips of ""Jackie Brown"" in Acting 101 classes for Deniro's performance alone.  It is too bad, for the sake of this film as a whole, that Deniro's character was such a small part.  Two of the best scenes in this movie are between Deniro and Jackson, in a panel truck, and between Deniro and Bridget Fonda, in a parking lot.  ""Jackie Brown"" gets bogged down in the scenes between Grier and Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen, as two narcotics policemen.  The ordinarily likeable Keaton is out of his element here, trying to play a tough but well-meaning cop. He isn't able to establish any chemistry between himself and Grier.  As the hero, Forster did a much better job of that, and Jackson as well, as the anti-hero.  Fonda is believable as Jackson's ""blonde surfer girl"".  You see flashes of Quentin Tarantino's magic touch in ""Jackie Brown"" but mostly this film is remarkable only for a few very special acting performances amidst some questionable casting choices.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Sluggish,"I lost interest after 1 1/2 hours.It dragged, and this being Tarantino & Elmore Leonard, I waited patiently to no avail, while enjoying Pam Grier. Robert De Niro comes from The Downturned Mouth School Of Acting. And what's with Samuel Jackson's grotesque wig? ""Get Shorty"", another Elmore Leonard story, snapped, crackled & popped - it was fun from frame one and it had no payoff either, but who cares? It was delicious all the way - saw it three times. Tarantino writes the best dialogue, but apparently not here - why try to improve on Elmore Leonard?",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Read The Book Rum Punch The Movie was better,The Book Rum Punch by Elmore Lenoard was completely different than this movie. The best things Tarrantino did was switch the location from South Florida/Cayman Islands to L.A./Cabo and switch the lead character Jackie Burke from a blonde 40ish white woman to a 40ish black lady Jackie Brown. When you read the book its confusing why Lenoard made the lead character white because the story flow isn't that good. Tarrantino also removed a couple other sidelines from the book which all in all made the movie much better than the book. Pam Grier in a way brings elements of all her 1970s characters into Jackie which if you liked her early work you'll love this. Jackie in many ways is sort of like Foxy Brown over 40 and out of options but still with her brain. Ordell played by Samuel Jackson underestimates Jackie and it costs him big.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The most underrated film of 1997.,"A lot of people don't realize why Pulp Fiction was such a great movie.  It excelled in two areas:  characters and story.  Both were great.  Jackie Brown has fascinating, well-defined characters who scheme and plot and think and act like real people.  I could watch them all day.  The plot is labyrinthine, twisted, satisfying, and genuine.  These are real people using their brains to try to pull something off.  Brains are what matter most in this film.  Tarantino--for all his hype--is a great director because he writes great, realistic characters and he's a terrific storyteller.  This film has all of these elements.  It's a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not One of My Favorite Leonard Adaptations for Film,"Jackie Brown(1997) is a major disappointment following the brilliant and strange Pulp Fiction(1994).  A huge plus for the film is the cast and their performances.  A rare De Niro feature where he is not the center of attention in Jackie Brown(1997).  Too eratic in story and some scenes.  A average take on an Elmore Leonard movie compared to 52 Pick Up or Get Shorty.

Waited fifteen years for a second viewing,"I first watched Jackie Brown when it came out in the cinema back in 1997. And, like so many people at the time, I was unimpressed. I fell into that large group of people who felt it wasn't up to the violent/gory standards of Reservoir Dogs or the cleverly made-up standards of Pulp Fiction.Now, fifteen years later, I decided to watch it again and see if my opinion has changed. Now I'm not so blown away with the great Pulp Fiction, I thought I might be less biased.Sadly, my opinion hasn't changed that much.This time I was able to look at it as a stand-alone film, not just 'Pulp Fiction 2,' yet, unfortunately, I still found it sub-standard.It's two and a half hours long. And, for quite a lot of time, it really feels like it. Samuel L Jackson plays a similar (if not as cool/likable) character as his one in Pulp Fiction and does his best to carry the show. Robert DeNiro is obviously a great actor of the modern age, yet he doesn't seem to come alive at all. He mainly sits on the sofa looking like someone who's come on his own to a nightclub and doesn't know whether he should leave or not. (despite participating in the film's really only shocking and unexpected moment of the film). Plus the film's titular character, Pam Grier, is as good as she can be and Bridget Fonda makes good eye candy for the lads! The major gripe I have with the film is its constant use of over-wordy dialogue for scenes. Yes, we get to know the characters well through how they interact with each other, but it's just too much. Each scene is dragged out for longer than it feels like it needs to be.Sometimes films are re-released as a 'director's cut' with added material. Jackie Brown is one film I'd like to see a director's cut of which has been trimmed down to a shorter run-time.Jackie Brown is not Pulp Fiction. It doesn't try to be. It does win points for staking a claim to being a film in its own right. However, the fact remains is that it just isn't as good as anything Quentin Tarrantino has done before it, or since.I'm glad I gave it a second viewing. Even though now I doubt I'll ever watch it again (even in another fifteen years time), I didn't feel like I'd completely wasted the two and a half hours of my life. I just felt that there are better gangster-style films of the genre than this, despite its impressive ensemble cast.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tarantino Does it Again,"In my opinion, Jackie Brown had more entertainment value than Reservoir Dogs and was more believable--if not better--than Pulp Fiction. Currently, I'm going through my Tarantino phase and have seen three of his movies (four if you count Natural Born Killers--a waste of film) in the past week. Jackie Brown, with its complex crime plot and detailed characters, is a must-see for anyone who is a fan of the genre.What really holds this film together is the fabulous acting. Pam Grier was wonderfully cast as the middle-aged, lower class, clever stewardess, and Samuel L. Jackson, as a tough gun dealer, were both wonderful choices.Overlong, maybe, but with the terrific acting, delightful screenplay, and solid direction, it manages to keep your attention throughout. 9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Some thoughts...,"I'll refrain from summarizing the entire film because you've either already seen it or you're interested in watching the story. Instead I'll just share some thoughts I had with you.It definitely felt like a step down from most of his films. There wasn't anything revolutionary about the film. The beginning seemed to lag for a good while. It eventually picked up steam during the heist portion of the movie, but that in itself didn't really seem to have anything new to add to that genre. The were some really nice long shots in the film (I'm a huge fan of artistically staged lengthy takes), the car pulling into the empty lot on the other side of the fence is a good example. I will say tho, that there were some long shots that seemed to be stretched out for no apparent reason other than just to do it.The acting was solid. The characters were a mix. Jackie was stuck in a dead end job for somewhere around twenty years and yet she proved to be quite the master mind by the end of the movie. Kind of makes you wonder why she wasn't able to advance in her career. Jackson's character was well played and was indeed intriguing, but after a while I kind of wished he would leave me alone.It's not a bad movie, but not one I would recommend to someone else. These are just my thoughts on this particular project. If you're interested in the film I'd urge you to see it and make your own.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Y'know? Quentin Tarantino has made a lot of great films, and this one is right up there with his best. It has all of his trademarks - a fantastic cast, snappy dialogue, creative story-telling, excellent pace, a retro/cool soundtrack, and several ""big"" moments. It also has a nearly perfect level of discipline and restraint, which make it that much better. Love Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Robert Forster, and Bridget Fonda in this.

Tarentino Stumbles...,"Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, but based on Elmore Leonard's 1995 bestseller Rum Punch, the ridiculously too-long Jackie Brown is like Pulp Fiction on a weight-reduction plan.  Gone are all the fattening calories like long-winded, witty dialogue, ultra-violence, street-humor, over-the-top character development and good roles for everyone (`Tiny' Lister, Chris Tucker and Robert DeNiro play stock characters with next-to-nothing to do).Let's just say the best thing about Jackie Brown is... well, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), a hard-up stewardess who supplements her meager income by smuggling cash into the US for a gunrunner named Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson).  Grier, the blaxploitation she-god of 70s tough-cookie flicks, barely misses a step, proving she belongs back on the silver-screen amidst Julia Roberts and Sigourney Weaver.  But Jackson, on the other hand -- I found myself caring less and less about his near-unexciting character!Crime goes unpunished until Jackie is nabbed by ATF agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and LA detective Mark Dargus (Michael Bowman), at which point a cat-and-mouse caper begins.  The cops pressure Jackie to help bring down Ordell, threatening prison if she refuses (Ordell wants to kill her before she does). So, with the help of sympathetic bail bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), Jackie launches a foolishly daring plan.The biggest problem with Jackie Brown is that Tarentino made a film with `real' salt-of-the-earth characters  the kind of conspiring people you see in local bars who live right around the corner.  Unfortunately, most `real' people we know are boring and limp; certainly less-than-dynamic.  And that's not why we love Tarentino, it's why we love film-makers like John Sayles. But Tarentino himself set us up for this fall  two sensational films followed by an ordinary film?  Let's hope Tarentino has got a heavy brand of cork and rubber in his next bat when he steps up to the plate again -- I'd hate to think of him as a two-trick pony!At least there wasn't a chase-scene to end the film.",,Anonymous,Crime

Yes, there is a good cast, there is the most important thing - dialogues written by Tarantino and several storylines intersecting to the ending.

Two of the World's Greatest Writers Join Forces,"Quentin Tarantino is one of the few filmmakers that will adapt a novel by a popular and well- received veteran novelist like Elmore Leonard, whose books are famous for not being adapted into very good movies, twist it into a blaxploitation homage, change the settings and a few things about the characters, and make it the best adaptation ever made of that author's work...save for Out of Sight, of course. Tarantino has that way of charmingly ruffling up other people's work and making it his own and somehow getting us to love it. Jackie Brown is wonderful.This is inarguably Quentin's least appreciated film. This is something like saying the Holy Spirit is not as appreciated as the Father and the Son, because all of his films are appreciated. They're looked at by incredible amounts of people as ingenious, groundbreaking cinema. However, Jackie Brown is not mentioned as often, it's not quoted constantly, it doesn't have a following, and it's not on IMDb's Top 250, where Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and the Kill Bills have their places. I think it deserves more recognition than it gets. l think that the reason it's his least appreciated film is frankly because it's not soaked in blood and it's a battle wits more than weapons. Even though I love blood-soaked gorefests, highlights of such a kind of film being those other four Tarantino films, I think it's awfully shallow to expect such a narrow criteria from such a brilliant filmmaker like him, leaving his other efforts in the shadows. Jackie Brown has a lot to offer: One of the finest ensemble casts I've ever seen, Tarantino's trademark salt-of-the-earth dialogue (""Beaumont ain't got a doin'- time kind of disposition...""), a roller-coaster rush of a soundtrack including forcibly head-bobbing 1970s funk with unforgettable highlights like Bobby Womack's Across 110th Street and The Brothers Johnson's Strawberry Letter #23, and a clever con game that is slowly unraveled.Jackson ignites the screen with his infectious and eternally memorable portrayal of Ordell Robie, the perfect opposite to his Jules Winnfield. He's an eccentric who doesn't realize it, a nearly laughable pseudo-badass-businessman exterior, but with a cold-hearted interior quietly ahead of everyone else, a clever double-sided mastermind.Grier naturally gives off that down-home, unsophisticated streetwise woman-trying-to- make-it feeling in the movie's title heroine, especially early on when we're just coming to know her as a character and she's not saying much, tired from nights spent in jail, just wanting a drink and a smoke and to go home, but knowing something about her situation isn't adding up. We learn to love her not just as a badass black chick in a suit with a gun, but as a middle-aged woman trying to cling to that semblance of a life she has and taking such risks to beat the odds.One surprise in Jackie Brown is the presence of Robert De Niro. It seems appropriate that Tarantino, someone who so embraces the crime genre and having done so much with Harvey Keitel, should cast De Niro as a seasoned career scumbag, the staple of his tremendous career. The surprise is that he plays the character down, which is so rare for him to do. Usually, De Niro takes a character and plays him up, making him a bigger, tougher, more brazen and bombastic character, sometimes just a little bit and sometimes a lot. Jackie Brown is a departure from the majority of his other work. His character shares a lot of the same traits as most of De Niro's other tough guys and crooks, but his disposition is so different. It makes this one of his most intriguing performances.Those who've overlooked this gem, buried in all the hype of Tarantino's other classics, you're really really missing out.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Rich, pulsing, dramatic, convincing, and archly fantastic, like the best of fiction films","Jackie Brown (1997)Tarantino's films are so dependably well made--well written, acted, directed, filmed, and with great music--it's hard to not like them in the most sensual way, with our eyes and ears. Jackie Brown has everything going for it, including a straight up crime plot with some great, logical twists. The woman playing Jackie Brown is Pam Grier, the real deal, famous for early 1970s blaxploitation films, and of course included not only for her great presence, but for her ties to the scene the Tarantino was trying to recreate.Then there is Robert Forster, as amazing as Samuel Jackson, and with a more difficult part (playing a bondsman who is lowkey and subtle, next to Jackson's bad guy cool guy gunrunner). The two cops (including Michael Keaton) are great, and Robert De Niro has a small, steady role as well. If there is any one weak actor it's Bridget Fonda, and her role is to be exactly the kind of shallow, selfish person she portrays, so maybe that works, too.Does the movie transport you and sweep you in? Absolutely. Do you care about what happens to all these believable characters? Not entirely, but mostly. There is a sense of style of substance, of plot over character development here. And even the nature of the plot, mostly hinging on some money that has to exchange hands, is almost too simple for such a long movie.Yet, some of the most delicious, moving moments are just when the camera lingers on someone's face, and a reaction is slowly coming out, and it takes so long you can't stand it. This is what makes great movies, and Tarantino really has a feel for how to make the scenario really get under your skin, not through shock (the violence here is mostly out of view) but through a manipulation of the medium, the photographer and editing. I think you could study Jackie Brown the way people study Pulp Fiction to see how a contemporary film can be made. Certainly the series of versions of the same scene in the clothing store near the end, each from a different viewpoint is textbook stuff. And effective.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

QUINTESSENTIAL TARANTINO,"Honestly, this movie doesn't match the brilliance of its predecessor, PULP FICTION. However, this movie is still a Quentin Tarantino flick. Great directors have their own style: their movies may fall into particular rubrics, but they have a unique identity of their own, creating a different blend of movies, confirming rigidly to their specific style. Quentin Tarantino has his own way of directing and conceptualizing his movies, and JACKIE BROWN, has all the sine qua nons of a trademark Quentin' movie.To begin with, the combination of American & African-American gangster pair still continues on from its predecessor. Even this pair of gangsters (Robert De Niro and Samuel L Jackson) is as ruthless and unemotional as the pair (Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta) in PULP FICTION, in executing gory killings. The plot is pretty simple: A female flight attendant, working hand-in-glove with an arms dealer tries to trick him and loot him of his own money. Within the execution of the plot, one is bombarded with the quintessential Tarantino': great dirty' dialogues, brilliant retro music, (instead of using background scores, Quentin uses songs) detached & controlled butcherly violence, and of course, the bohemian funny nature of the characters.Though pretty much in the same lines as PULP FICTION, JACKIE BROWN isn't as inane and mindless as its precursor. Far from his 1994 attempt, which is a classic, Quentin's 1997 attempt, though not in the ranks of PULP FICTION, is still a fantastically made Tarantino' flick.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is a cool movie,"Tarantino makes films you either love or hate. There doesn't seem to be much in between. Jackie Brown is one that I love; in my opinion one of his best. (See my IMDb reviews for some of the ones I hate!)When you first watch this you are reminded of crappy low-budget 70's US action flicks - indeed in a few scenes we can see such films being watched by the protagonists in the house. It's homage. This is one of the things Tarantino likes to do - he likes to pay homage. He certainly watched a lot of trash in his formative years - but because of this he can come up with cool movies like Jackie Brown, Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction. There is complete homage to the music. The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant, but as with all things Tarantino though - it's all borrowed.This sounds like detraction. It isn't. Everything about Jackie Brown works; seedy sets, downmarket airline outfits, the cars, the interiors, the music - the imagery created is first-class. The dialogue handed to the players is good, the acting strong. Sometimes Tarantino dialogue grates - but not here, it works perfectly well because the plot setting (downmarket...) is convincing.Jackson is very good as a not-too-bright but very dangerous second rate gun runner. Bridget Fonda is fun as the kid who got washed up early in life. Keaton is good as a 'Fed perhaps on the brink of getting lucky. This is an odd wholly out of type showing from De Niro; basically a thick washed-up loser. You would hardly know he was there - but what he does, he does well.The major plaudits are reserved for two; Bail Bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster) - who rightly got an Oscar nomination. His chiselled features and evident hard life are given appropriate prominence. He has a good script to work with and we feel for him, especially at the end. A brilliant performance.The second major plaudit goes to Jackie Brown (Pam Grier). Like the others, she has graduated from the school of hard-knocks. Like the others - she is washed-up, a bit of a loser. But she knows it, and sees a way to come out of this on top. Power to her! She is cool - as cool as the 70's music she plays.Overall - this is an excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Has aged better than Pulp Fiction,"When this was originally released it was greeted with people putting up with it but going home to watch Pulp Fiction again, in order to maintain their love of Tarantino. BUT, for me this film gets better every 5 years, while Pulp for whatever reason gets more and more dated. I can't explain it, maybe different film and or camera quality?With Jackie, it's a great 'what the hell just happened?' kind of plot, consistent to QT's first 3 films. It always has me going until the end. Sam Jackson, Michael Keaton, his cop partner, and Robert De Niro are all awesome, true highlights, especially De Niro. Bridget Fonda is pretty good, holds her part well. The low lights are Pam Grier, in the title role ironically, and Robert Forster. I firmly believe it is their ""relationship"" that made this film 30 min too long and made the overall movie experience lacklustre. There's 3 or 4 scenes with these 2 that are really weak and unnecessary, while showcasing some less than exciting music as well.That aside, the plot is cool, the vibe is great when it's not bad (haha), it has all the QT feels to it, with a typical QT tornado/domino effect ending. Reservoir Dogs is a great debut but always reeks of a 1 million budget, Pulp remains the QT high bar, Kill Bill 1&2 are eh ok, Death Proof even more forgotten than JB, Inglorious and Django are a whole different QT that are good but only for 2-3 viewings, while Once Upon should have been a lot better. In 2022, for a solid, in his initial peek, still hanging on to indie roots Quentin Tarantino caper film, I feel this has aged better than any of his films. Without the initial post-Pulp hype and anticipation, this film plays a lot better when the audience goes into it with new and fresh eyes.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tarantino leaves his calling card with Elmore Leonard,"""Jackie Brown"" was pretty much what I expected, with a few notable exceptions.  First of all Pam Grier did an outstanding job as the hard on her luck stewardess.  In a film as filled with cinema giants as this one (Deniro, Jackson, and Keaton) is, she more than held her own.  And although it is getting tiresome to see Samuel L. Jackson in foul-mouthed, ""heavy"", violent roles, he does do it very well.  The bail-bondsman who becomes a very integral part in the film can attest to that.  Many of their scenes together showed that Jackson can quite easily intimidate almost anybody.As far as the story, it was mildly interesting, though I'm not sure if the constant flashback/different points of view really worked for me after awhile.  To be fair, I did not read local favorite Leonard's novel, but the plot seemed a little disjointed to me.  One thing I did like, however, were the extended scenes with good dialogue, mostly with Grier, Jackson, and the bondsman.  It was an intriguing idea, a well-made movie, but it lacked something that would have made it a favorite.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Samuel Jackson was really good in this movie even though his character seemed to similar to his Pulp Fiction one. Robert DeNiro had an unimportant but amusing role.

This one´s a winner!,"I´ve always been a huge fan of blaxploitation-queen Pam Grier and her stunning cult movies like ""Coffy"", ""Foxy Brown"" or ""Friday Foster"", and I also love Quentin Tarantino and his cool gangsta films ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction""! Now, both icons made a film together and my hopes were more than tremendous toward it, however I was quite disappointed when I saw ""Jackie Brown"" for the first time about two years ago: there was too much talk and too much political correctness to be really enthusiastic! Jackie was neither tough nor sexy enough to be a second Foxy! But I was wrong: Tarantino´s film is brilliant actor drama with fantastic protagonists like Robert de Niro show Samuel L. Jackson and Bridget Fonda in the lead! However, the greatest thing is main actress Pam Grier herself: she has nothing lost of her sex appeal and is still one of the most gorgeous ladies on our planet! Her acting is great, she even steals Robert de Niro´s, but she didn´t use her chance for further appearances in better movies, what is quite incomprehensible to me! But also director and script writer Tarantino once more did a great job: loved the marvelous 1970s-soundtrack and the plot is as well-developed as in ""Pulp Fiction""! Some may call it a bore, I call it one of the best films of the last decade!!!",,Anonymous,Crime
Jackie Beige,"A well directed, well acted, well scripted film that steadfastly refuses to move out of first gear throughout its entire duration. Every time you're convinced it's suddenly about to spring alive into a riveting, engrossing, high octane classic... it doesn't.Starting with its initial home media release, I made 3 or 4 genuine attempts (over the course of about 20 years) to make it through Jackie Brown without falling asleep, and each time I failed in my mission. Today I took one last swing, and managed to get through the entire movie without losing consciousness. The reward I get for my persistence and dedication is a 6/10 movie.Nothing about this is bad. No one is bad - although Samuel L Jackson is a bit of a cheeseball here, too stricken with verbal diarrhoea to be properly believable. Pam Grier and Robert Forster are good. The plot is good. The soundtrack is good, and well applied. Everything fine... It just takes way too much time to do what it apparently has to do, and does it with the fearsome no-holds-barred swagger of a clinically depressed manatee.

The dialouge is top notch, the characters infinitely interesting and the sweet, sweet direction amazed me.Pam Grier deserved an Oscar nomination for her turn as the money smugling stewrdess making 16 thousand dollars a year.

Underrated slow burn film,Jackie Brown is very underrated and you don't hear much about it compared to Tarintinos other films. It's prob one of his weakest films but that doesn't mean it's not good.

Jackie Brown (1997),"This feels like a mellow breather between the sensation of PULP FICTION and the epic KILL BILL. It doesn't really push a lot of boundaries, or crackle with snappy monologue, or provide much tension or action. It's a bit on the slow side and except for the title character, the personalities aren't especially memorable. But it's still a good movie with some style. I hadn't seen it in a long time and had forgotten most of it, so I enjoyed getting wrapped up in the story all over again. Pam Grier is terrific, and although I rarely think about him, I realized that I always like seeing Michael Keaton at work. Maybe this is too ""P.C."" of me (never mind how much I hate that term) but I do feel a little uneasy about how comfortable Tarantino is with the n-word. I don't think having Samuel L. Jackson say it or being a blaxploitation aficionado necessarily makes it okay. I guess I have this image of QT thinking he's being ""real"" or ""edgy"" or something by sprinkling it so liberally throughout his scripts. But perhaps I'm just projecting. It's a nitpicky complaint, anyway. While the film doesn't reach the dizzying heights of Tarantino firing on all cylinders, it's one I like watching more than RESERVOIR DOGS.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Character-Driven Tarantino,"In many ways this film is typical but also atypical Tarantino. Nothing in the film is anything outside the realm of possibility for pre-Jackie Brown Tarantino but it's much different than his previous work. For one, the narrative is mostly linear or at least relatively linear. This compounded with the fact that the plot isn't as dense as his other work makes for a much easier story to follow. Some of the details do become a bit muddled but it isn't a serious problem. The film is defined by its characters moreso than its plot. The characters make the movie more engaging than the plot does, in my opinion. The characters are great. They're entertaining but it's not quite enough to carry the film up to the quality of its predecessors, for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""I'm serious as a heart attack.""","Tarantino is able to make great movies no matter what, and this movie is another testament to why I love this guys movies. Sure, he isn't entirely original, but his movies are entertaining, and you don't need to understand such hopelessly trivial ""deep"" themes to understand. The reason you should watch movies is the entertainment value, that's what matters so much. Themes are there in real life, so you really don't need them in movies. Sure, themes and social commentary make good movies, but liking movies even though they have a lack of meaning doesn't (of course, it helps to know, however, many mindless movies are actually more boring than movies with subtle meaning). Just to be sure, Jackie Brown is a bit restrained but still has the Tarantino trademarks that we all know and love.Bridget Fonda is so absolutely perfect as gun-runner Samuel L. Jackson's sassy ""surfer chick"" that you are convinced that this is who Bridget Fonda really is. Robert De Niro was given a long leash in his portrayal of a dim-witted, recently-paroled bank robber (not exactly a typecast for him... and he nails it. And the other characters that spice up the plot are all well-formed and well-acted. But it's the improbable relationship between Jackie and Max that grabs you and won't let you go. Like a swirling, cool, evening fog by the waterfront on a steamy, summer evening, it is hard to define and even harder to grasp, but you know you like it. Music and dialogue carry this movie and are the two ingredients that make it such a pleasure to take in. The film's been described as ""slow-moving,"" but people who say that don't realize that the pace is purposefully done slow so one can enjoy each characters' interactions. Sam Jackson's character, for as messed up as he is, is a piece of art. Charismatic dialogue. Jackie Brown is the Tarantino film that mostly goes over lot's of people's heads, but it is no less entertaining in many ways (although it's not as good as Pulp Fiction, obviously). Don't be fooled by Jackie Brown's different approach and black sheep persona of the Tarantino canon, it's just one of his charms that his movies seem to be black sheeps when compared to certain others. In any case, ignoring this fine work would be kind of futile.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Highly enjoyable crime caper,"Tarantino is often derided by his dismissives as an over zealous, pop-culturally obsessed schizoid with a penchant for fetishizing violence and, oddly enough, feet. But in this 1997 adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel, and hot off the heels off the watershed event that was Pulp Fiction three years prior, he chose to follow up his electric filmography by incorporating a slightly more complex and elegant plot in the form of a heist caper. What sets it apart from other entries in the genre (and subsequent adaptations of Leonard works by the likes of other gen X indie directors like Soderbergh), is Tarantino's unique combination of cinema homage and pastiche that gives the proceedings a fresh and vibrant aura. Tarantino skillfully employs elements of blaxploitation through choice soundtrack, camera work, and elegant casting. Pam Grier in the eponymous title role as a middle aged Afro-American woman attempting to emerge out on top of a crime sting is not only a headstrong and intelligently spunky protagonist, but through the course of the film she offers an acute sensitivity to her situation that adds a gravity to the story. coupled with a subtle turn by Robert Forster, in a similair comeback role to John Travolta in Pulp, as an aging, jaded bail bondsman who is injected with a burst of vitalic romantic interest in Jackie Brown, and the subsequent bonding that grows between them offers Tarantino his most empathetically human and thematic material thus far.But the most entertaining turn in from the cast is Samuel L Jackson as the fast-talking, foul mouthed thug who isn't quite as clever of a criminal as he thinks he is. The often witty and hilarious dialogue exchanges between he, Bridget Fonda, and an unassuming Robert DeNiro as a bumbling, apathetic accomplice is amusing and carries the film deftly onward, even when it threatens to be dragged down by the slightly dry plot. But there is a noticeable lack of cloying pop cultural references in the script that Tarantino is known for. Instead, it is all just great character acting, and he manages to make the mundane a roller coaster of verbal levity.The look of the picture is great, with skillfully composed shots and fine tuned audio, with a killer soundtrack to top it off. Jackie Brown is a tightly made film that delivers in its black humor and a feel good tale of one sassy feminist throwback getting the better of her clueless colleagues, and learning a little bit of mid life wisdom along the way. Highly recommended for fans of well constructed and stylish crime capers.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Most movies by Tarantino have a great story but this one is definitely an exception to that, if this had been made before Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs maybe it could be chalked up to him still finding his style but since it came after those two excellent films it's a big disappointment. This gets 5 stars only because of the quality of the acting, Jackie Brown with lesser actors would rate a 2.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"This isn't Tarantino's best film, but it is an entertaining picture with some great writing and characters","Jackie Brown (1997) is currently available on HBOMax and tells the tale of a flight attendant who runs money across the border for an arms dealer. When she gets arrested she is approached by both the government and arms dealer with plots on the remaining money. She creates an intricate plan to distract both while getting away with half a million dollars. This movie is directed by Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill) and stars Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), Pam Grier (Coffy), Bridget Fonda (Point of No Return), Robert De Niro (Casino), Sid Haig (House of 1,000 Corpses), Robert Forster (The Delta Force), Chris Tucker (Rush Hour) and Michael Keaton (Batman). The storyline for this picture is intricate and very smart. It has excellent dialogue and a tremendous script. The acting is also perfect and the cast is perfectly selected. There was great chemistry and execution throughout the film and it was hilarious to see Haig as a judge.

The least Tarantino of Tarantino films is still a ton of fun,"Tarantino's lone adaptation of pre-existing material, though that's an argumentative point since so many of his projects are derivative of others (i.e. RESERVOIR DOGS adapting CITY ON FIRE or TRUE ROMANCE riffing on BADLANDS, etc.). What's fun about his adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel ""Rum Punch"" is that he made it into a Blaxploitation film homage. Casting Pam ""Coffee/Foxy Brown"" Grier in the lead role and giving her the much cooler name of Jackie Brown instead of Jackie Burke. Grier plays a flight attendant who's caught cash from South America for drug dealer/gun dealer Sam Jackson and then finds herself caught between competing interests, working for the ATF, working for Sam Jackson, or working with her bail bondsman, Max Cherry, the fantastic Robert Forester in a career reviving role, much like what Tarantino did for John Travolta with PULP FICTION. Leonard's novel is a perfect source material for Tarantino, where both writers excel at mixing crime, violence, and quirky humor. JACKIE BROWN came out the same year as Steven Soderbergh's OUT OF SIGHT, which is the better of the two films, but one fun connection is that Michael Keaton plays federal agent Ray Nicolette in a small cameo in JACKIE BROWN and a larger supporting role in OUT OF SIGHT. Where JACKIE BROWN lags is in pacing. There are some slow stretches with not especially anything interesting happenings except for the plot being pushed forward. Still, Tarantino fills the movie with a terrific cast, which besides, Grier, Jackson, Forester, and Keaton, includes Robert De Niro as an ex-con stoner, Bridget Fonda as a stoner hippie chick, Michael Bowman as (what else) a jerk, Chris Tucker, Tiny Lister, Sid Haig (also a veteran of Blaxploitation films, who'd actually quit acting until this film), and look fast for Denise Crosby as a Public Defender in an uncredited role. Besides the cast, you also get Tarantino's trademark snappy dialogue, such as:Ordell Robbie: My ass may be dumb, but I ain't no dumbass.OROrdell Robbie: Here we go. AK-47. The very best there is. When you absolutely, positively got to kill every motherf---er in the room, accept no substitutes.ORJackie Brown: Shut your raggedy ass up and sit the f--- down!Another Tarantino hallmark, the film features a fantastic soundtrack using a super cool collection of preexisting music.

Great Movie!,"I loved this movie, but then I loved everything else Tarentino has had his hands in.  I loved True Romance and Natural Born Kilers, especially the courtroom scene, which was all his.  This movie is not typical Tarantino because it was based on a book not written by Tarantino.  It was based on a book by Elmore Leonard orginally called Rum Punch.  Elmore Leonard is another master of the dialogue, and he should be credited for much of the story and dialogue.  The movie dragged because it was a copy of the book, only missing a few scenes.  I loved the way the movie was done, and it was fabulous.  I love Elmore Leonard and Tarantino.  The dialogue between the two was almost perfect.  However, I think that Tarantino fans of his first two films should not see this expecting the same type of fare.  This is Leonard-land, and it is a glorious place.",,Anonymous,Crime

Quentin Tarantino's most mature film till date,"While not necessarily his best, Jackie Brown is easily the most mature, most complete, film Quentin Tarantino has made till date. No other Tarantino film can match Jackie Brown's storytelling, character development and realism. The movie accentuates Tarantino's love not only for cult/obscure films and pulp fiction novels but also for the forgotten movie stars.By handpicking two washed out actors like Pam Grier and Robert Forster to play the major parts in Jackie Brown, Tarantino, a self- confessed admirer of both of theirs work, took a huge big but his faith in them didn't go unrewarded as both deliver superb performances with Forster even getting his first Academy Award nomination.The memorable performances of Grier and Forster are well backed up by the rest of the cast: Samuel L. Jackson once again plays an N- word loving hit-man to a tee, only this time it is more repugnant than Pulp Fiction. Michael Keaton plays an ATF agent with his usual frenzy. Robert De Niro effortlessly essays the part of a sociopathic ex-convict. And Bridget Fonda skillfully plays a drugged-addict moll. Rarely does anyone miss a keynote.Tarantino's brilliant choice of stock music further adds to the movie's experience. The direction and editing is absolutely top notch. Tarantino doesn't spoon-feed the audience and delivers an ending that certainly keeps the avenues open for some of the major characters.For more on cinema, please visit my film blog ""A Potpourri of Vestiges"".",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Another Feather In Tarantino's Cap,"This movie was a blast. And whether it was intentional or not (I'm sure it was) it was a riot. Samuel L. Jackson was a barrel of laughs as the main bad guy, Ordell.This was a cleverly written movie about a flight attendant, Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), trying to avoid the law, avoid a known criminal and take a big payday in the process. It's not about a big heist or major robbery; it's simply about a middle aged woman trying to stay free and get out of the doldrums of working for a small airline.Like I said, Sam Jackson made the movie. Pam was great, but Sam was truly the star to me. His delivery is so on point. He effortlessly runs off zingers and deadpan humor. His performance in this was even better than ""Pulp Fiction"".

This movie can't be rushed or crammed because for me Jackie Brown is a character study from person to person , we are given time to analyse each character to and to see them for what they really are. Everything in this movie is form following function and that can be told from Tarintino's heavy study on the lingo used by the characters and not to mention the soundtrack and settings which just add homage to the genre. This movie is different from what others might expect from QT , but it really has to be followed closely and appreciated as we get to see him stretch out his wings further into the artistic world of directing. Having said that I feel that Jackie Brown may not be for everyone because not everyone will understand it will probably require than one viewing but if you can get through that then trust me you might really get to see it for what it really is.JACKIE BROWN : 8.6 OUT OF 10THIS Christmas , SANTA'S GOT A BRAND NEW BAG...",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino's Best!,"""Jackie Brown"" from 1997, is director Quentin Tarantino's adaptation of Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch,"" and is a masterclass in storytelling that combines sharp dialogue, complex characters, and a meticulously crafted plot. The film features the incredible Pam Grier in the title role, delivering a career-defining performance that is both powerful and intense, embodying the essence of a resourceful, but aging woman caught between the criminal underworld, the cops, and her own moral compass. The superb supporting cast, including Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Robert Deniro, Bridget Fonda and more, adds layers of depth all around, each character vividly portrayed with their own motives and desires. Tarantino's signature style shines through in the film's non-linear structure, expertly weaving together various perspectives and timelines that keep things moving briskly. The cinematography (Guillermo Navarro) captures the gritty yet stylish atmosphere of 90's Los Angeles, while the meticulously curated soundtrack enhances the film's tone, evoking nostalgia and adding a rich background tapestry for what transpires. Tarantino the writer has penned some great films in his career, but this one may just be arguably his best directed effort. Because it is an adaptation, some noticeable excesses of his unique style are missing, but that turns out to be a curiously positive thing, adding a few needed restraints that work beautifully here. While his style is unmistakable here, there is much more of a tighter story structure in this gem than most of his other films, which works extremely well to its advantage. The characters here also seem a lot more believable and grounded in reality than some of the more unusual, eccentric ones in his other films, and this again makes it all work flawlessly. Historically, this will probably never be treated by most audiences with quite the same love and admiration as Tarantino's more groundbreaking and famous movies, but it should. Irresistible, always entertaining, and truly compelling filmmaking from start to finish.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Quite good, really!","I put off seeing this film until just 2 days ago, and now I wonder why I waited so long!  This is a GREAT flick!  Superb acting all around (Tarantino had the sense NOT to give himself an on-screen role!), more twists than a really twisty thing (I've never been good with analogies), and an EXCELLENT soundtrack make for pure movie watching enjoyment!  The ""N"" word is peppered pretty liberally thoughout the flick, so if you're not into that, you've been warned! All others, enjoy the show!",,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining film but way too long,"There was good acting, decent development of the main characters and an interesting plot however the film went on for far too long, making it very boring at times, given its rather simple plot. 90 minutes would suit it better than 150 minutes so it was overdrawn by something like one hour. Tarantino has an inclination for needlessly long conversations in his films.Also be aware that the scene towards the end of the film in the Billingsley department store was taken three times but it was all about the same events involving the same persons though from a different perspective so don't get confused.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very Underrated Film,This is such a good movie in general. I avoided watching it because it never just popped out to me I hate to say this but I was avoiding the movie and didn't realize how big of a mistake it was. I absolutely loved this movie for the characters and the music alone was just so fitting. Take the time to really just watch this love yes it's different than Tarantino's other popular films but it is just as good.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining in an old fashioned way.,Tarantino slows down a little and shows his skill at plotting an entertaining tale that doesn't tax your patience. Less blood and more characterisations than usual - let's hope that those put off by the excesses of Reservoir Dogs don't miss out on an entertaining movie more similar in genre to crime/scam 70's classics than 90's shock tactics.  Helped along (as usual) by strong performances and great casting - I loved DeNiro's small but significant role in particular.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of Tarantino's Best.,"When I first watched Jackie Brown, I thought it lacked something that Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction had: the entertainment factor. I liked the movie but I didn't enjoy it much. I re-watched it and re-watched it again and realized that it wasn't supposed to be like Reservoir Dogs nor Pulp Fiction.Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's most ""real"" film. Real in the way that it handles very true-to-life characters in a complex and well-written crime plot. Unlike Reservoir Dogs, which focused more on the violence; and Pulp Fiction, which had more cartoonish elements to it.As far as story goes, this is Tarantino's best. A very interesting, appropriately paced crime story that makes you think and pay real attention to understand all the details of what's going on.Acting-wise, superb. Every cast member does a brilliant job portraying these fantastic characters. Pam Grier and Sam Jackon have great chemistry, Robert Forster is amazing playing a low-key regular man, De Niro is very good and funny, and Bridget Fonda and Michael Keaton are great as well.The direction is good. I wouldn't call it Tarantino's best directing job (that'd be Pulp Fiction) but it's a very good work that shows quality.Overall, Jackie Brown is a very good film, and I mean the word very. Perhaps Tarantino's most underrated, but a great film with a great story and great characters.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino Lite,", I love Pam Grier and Tarantino is my favorite director. That being said, I was disappointed in his follow up to Pulp Fiction, a much better film. Pam is Jackie, a stewardess on a Mexican airline who smuggles cash for a gun runner named Ordell(Samuel L. Jackson). One of his workers, Beaumont, is arrested and jailed, so Ordell pays a bondsman, Max, to get him out in order to kill him before he turns informant. Too late, as he has already given Jackie's name and she is busted with planted cocaine and sent to the pokey. Her boss sends Max to bail her out and he is awed by her body and will not set her up to be killed. Instead they go back to her house where she pulls a gun on Ordell, and they make a deal where she will smuggle half a million dollars for him and he will retire. Of course, there is no honor among thieves, and Q.T. uses several plot twists throughout the Elmore Leonard inspired movie. It is also a tribute to Foxy Brown, the 60s blaxploitation film which starred Pam Grier. She still looks great; a very well preserved and sexy woman. The major problem is the 2-1/2 hour plus running time, which needed a good 1/2 hour edited out. Also, Bridget Fonda is one of the most annoying actresses on earth. She should go away forever. The rest of the cast is good, especially Robert Forster as Max and Robert DeNiro as Louis Gara. The length and Fonda's bad acting ruin it for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A poor follow-up to Pulp Fiction,"Quentin Tarantino`s third movie is not in the same class as his previous two(Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction). The movie is about Jackie Brown, a stewardess, who gets caught smuggling. The movie doesn`t have the good characters and cool dialogue seen in Tarantino`s others films, and is therefore nowhere near as good as his previous films.  The amount of violence has also decreased dramatically since Pulp Fiction, and violence is one of the main ingredients in Tarantino`s movies.   Overall, Jackie Brown is quite lacking in all areas. 4/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Pure Quentin,"Well, I guess actually with a good dose of Elmore thrown in. This is my favorite Quentin movie (of the ones I've seen) and in some ways it seems his most deliberately ""mainstream"" type film, almost cheesy at points. Pulp Fiction is a little too bizarre for even me, I loved moments of Grindhouse and Bastards but the whole didn't work as well. Pam Grier is the stewardess mule for evil gun runner Jackson, she gets stopped by goofy fed agent Keaton and needs the services of bail bondsman Forster. Add De Niro as a recently sprung con and Fonda as Samuel's ""secretary"" and you have a lot of talent to work with. Grier is appropriately tough, and the scene with De Niro and Fonda in the parking lot is hysterical in its own sick way. But I think the movie is stolen by Forster, who gives an Oscar caliber performance as the deadpan, stoic Max Cherry. This film is worth watching for his performance alone.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Quentin Lite,"Not being much of a Quentin Tarantino fan I thought this was the his most impressive film.  This has to do with a more interesting plot and better developed characters than earlier films.  The director does an excellent job of fleshing out some of the characters, especially Jakie (and what beautiful flesh it is, too.  Pam Greer never looked better.) and Ordell.  Robert de Niro's character was not developed into much although he did that wonderful secene with Bridgette Fonda at the clothes rack in the department store; i.e. The Stare.  Forster was very believable and clearly sympathetic.  I had no trouble imagining how it must be to kiss Jackie.The music was great.  I had no idea Tarantino had such a deep knowledge of the classics.I was amused by the use of period cars throughout the movie, even in parking lots.  Although the film make reference to the Gulf War, Cherry drive a late 1970's Seville? Surfer Girl drive a vintage VW Bus, and 1970s cars litter some parking lots at the mall.The plot had enough turns to it to stay unpredictable and engaging.  A fun film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"convincing actors, interesting plot, just like good wine","Like all the movies directed by QT you stay focused and interested in what comes next, through an not easily predictable plot. The actors and the strong colorful characters they play are very convincing. It is almost impossible not to find a character in QT's films you can not identify, sympathize with or admire. As it seems a lot of viewers are not able to catch every detail presented and have the impression that sometimes nothing happens and therefor find Jackie Brown not speedy enough. The details, the colorful characters, each with its unique style, and the rich plot need exactly the speed the movie has. It is just like a good red wine.

Actually I saw this film before watching Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction and those two movies appeared a little disappointing to me because I was expecting to see something like in Jackie Brown. So like I said the plot was good and another thing that I liked about this movie was Robert Forster's character which was very realistic, especially when he's at work.

Borderline bad,"This film is mostly Tarantino indulging himself, which brings me to the most obvious flaw in this movie - Pam Grier is not a good actress. QT apparently has some kind of affinity for her, probably stemming from the blaxploitation era films, but those movies were BAD, and so was she. Fun, to a degree, but bad. In a film with such talents as Sam Jackson, Bridget Fonda, Robert DeNiro and Michael Keaton, the vast majority of the scenery is chewed by the least charismatic actors. To make matters worse, Forster and Grier had next to zero chemistry.Pace was too slow, exacerbated by long, pointless steadicam walk-alongs that did nothing for the story. Ditto for the numerous long-take, single camera scenes. It just seemed to muzzle the performances. It was nearly painful to watch at times.There were some good scenes with Fonda, Deniro, and Jackson, but they were few and far between.I tried to like it when it came out, mainly because I like QT, and I probably overrated it at the time, basically rooting for it, and QT.

Very clever film,"I remember that Jackie Brown was on television once. I didn't watch it, but I remember seeing a short trailer or something.The story of Jackie Brown is well written for sure, but it feels like something is missing. The story works well and it thrilling and intriguing. I haven't read the original novel, but the fault lies either in the novel and story itself or Tarantino's ability to adapt the novel for screen. Not that it is a big problem, not every story can be extremely unique and one of a kind stories - the most important thing is that the story works. One weakness for the story is that for a moment in the beginning it alienates the audience, when they don't know the whole idea yet, and they are just trying to follow. Now it's easy to catch up and things do become much clearer, but for a moment there the viewer might not have a clue on what's going on - especially when they haven't read a summary or anything.Jackie Brown is also an interesting character, considering that for a moment you have no idea who she is lying to and whose side she is on. The only thing you can count on is that this whole thing better be good for her. And Pam Grier, oh my god, I think I am in love with her. She's an amazing actress and so beautiful.I love the music in this movie. Makes me think of some extravagant 70's police show.Jackie Brown is a very clever film.

"A very slick, entertaining caper","""It wasn't as good as 'Pulp Fiction',"" you've probably heard many people say.""Jackie Brown"" was Quentin Tarantino's follow-up to his 1994 Academy-Award winner ""Pulp Fiction."" Granted, this time around, Tarantino takes his filmmaking approach differently, but it is far more satisfying than its predecessor.A lot of you are probably thinking that what I just said is sacrilege. I'll repeat myself: ""Jackie Brown"" is better than ""Pulp Fiction"", and here's why:-- Smart retelling of an Elmore Leonard caper(his novel ""Rum Punch""), which always make for good films.-- Explosive soundtrack featuring Bobby Womack, The Delfonics, Johnny Cash and more.-- Excellent cinematography by Guillermo Navarro.-- Surehanded direction by Tarantino, who leisurely paces the film with some creative one-shot sequences, but never bores us, who embraces the blaxploitation film influences but never spoofing them, and doing something different from the similar ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"".-- The casting of Samuel L. Jackson, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda, Michael Keaton, Michael Bowen, Tommy ""Tiny"" Lister, Jr., Chris Tucker, and especially Robert Forster in his Academy-Award nominated turn as Max Cherry, the no-nonsense bail bondsman who helps set up the caper and can't help but fall for Jackie in the process.-- And, of course, Pam Grier, one of the most underused actresses we have, in her most explosive performance to date. She commands the screen with her sense of fear of Jackson's character, her sense of style (a nice touch involving buying a suit DURING the score) and her sense of cool. And her chemistry with Robert Forster is perfect. That last scene gets me every time.Plus, everyone told every key plot twist in ""Pulp Fiction"" before I ever got to see the damn thing. Worse things have happened, but Tarantino is not slumming. If anything, he is grown as a filmmaker, and I hope that he can take his time and give us something new to chew on. His next film, ""Kill Bill"" with David Carradine, Uma Thurman, Lucy Liu, Sonny Chiba and Daryl Hannah, sounds terrific.***1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,Crime

Tarantino awards 'Jackie Brown' an often foregone human element.,"'Jackie Brown' quickly became one of my favourite Tarantino films, and my satisfaction with the title began in the first scene, with a stylish set of opening credits, accompanied by Bobby Womack's wonderful 'Across 110th Street'. Pam Grier as the eponymous character delivers a brilliant, very convincing performance as a middle-aged flight attendant caught by the police with a bag of cocaine and a dubious amount of money. Jackie must then consider her options. The film boasts a surprisingly strong performance by Samuel L. Jackson, who seems to – and I know how strange this sounds – outperform Robert De Niro in places. Of course, the film benefits from the presence of the 'Taxi Driver' icon, but De Niro's performance is a little underwhelming. I'm choosing to attribute that to the writing of his character, though – which brings me on to my next point. One thing that has often deterred me from Tarantino's films is how cartoonlike his creations sometimes seem. I couldn't invest in the characters of 'True Romance', and I couldn't see 'Reservoir Dogs' as anything other than bizarre. Tarantino's world is inhabited by some unforgettable but not-quite-believable characters: Marsellus Wallace, O-Ren Ishii and Alabama Whitman are all examples of this. Pam Grier's Jackie Brown, however, is very believable, very ordinary and very human. This is where I think Tarantino made the right choice, as her fellow characters Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) and Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) would be a little too ""caricature"" in their own world. As Jackie Brown is the most normal aspect of 'Jackie Brown', she serves as a relatable reference point, allowing the desperation of her situation to really sink in. Standing at two and a half hours, the film teeters on the edge of losing momentum in several places, but it is consistently salvaged by some unexpected development, intelligent scene or well- placed soundtrack. The editing in 'Jackie Brown' is commendable, and it is shrewder than the editing in many other Tarantino films, not feeling at all arbitrary. There is one scene (or one series of scenes) which employs multiple-perspective editing excellently, and this scene remains the highlight of the film. I think that 'Jackie Brown' is Tarantino at his best, and I was consistently impressed.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Entertaining adaption from an Elmore Leonard novel,"(1997) Jackie Brown
CRIME DRAMAAdapted from the novel written by Elmore Leonard called ""Rum Punch"" written and directed by Quentin Tarantino starring Pam Grier as the title character of the movie ""Jackie Brown"" who happens to be an airline stewardess who also works for criminal, Ordell Robbie (Samuel Jackson). The actual movie doesn't start until it's been acknowledged that a former client(Chris Tucker) of Ordell had been shot and killed by Ordell himself for cautionary reasons since he had already been caught. And apparently Ordell is afraid of him snitching his illegal activities to the police for the possibility of a lighter sentence. For the movie dwells on two particular characters to succeed until the very end which is Jackie Brown and bail bondsman Max Cherry played by Robert Forster. As a result of the success of ""Get Shorty"" which was inspired by the success of ""Pulp Fiction"", Tarantino obviously decided to adapt an Elmore Leonard novel which consist of multiple characters intertwining with one another resulting to a very fun experience except that there were times that it felt a little too long. Robert DeNiro, Bridget Fonda and Michael Keaton also stars with pivotal roles.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino at His Best and Worst,"""Jackie Brown"" shows Quentin Tarantino at his very best - and his very worst. Like all of Tarantino's work ""Jackie Brown"" has razor sharp dialogue and unique characters driven by excellent performances from the entire cast. Pam Grier and Michael Keaton in particular create sympathetic, three demensional people that are among Tarantino's most realistic creations. As always Tarantino's music choices animate each and every scene, even if what's happening on screen is less interesting than the soundtrack.But there's a reason that ""Jackie Brown"" has a reputation of being one of Tarantino's weakest movies. Although it does highlight what's great about Tarantino, it suffers from his biggest flaw as a director: excess. Excessive characters, excessive language (more specifically, excessive racial slurs), and an excessive running time make ""Jackie Brown"" a less than entertaining experience. There's absolutely no reason for ""Jackie Brown"" to be over two and a half hours long - a running time that's largely the result of unnecessary filler and drawn out conversations. ""Pulp Fiction"" is longer than it needs to be, yet the characters are so original and entertaining that you don't care they talk too much. The characters in ""Jackie Brown"" are well-written, but they just aren't interesting enough to justify endless, long-winded conversations about nothing of importance. What worked in ""Pulp Fiction"" doesn't work in ""Jackie Brown."" Fortunately Tarantino learned from this and switched styles with ""Kill Bill"" 1 & 2, which remain two of my favorite films of the past 20 years.The central plot, which involves a flight attendant attempting to outsmart men on both sides of the law, is novel but simply not executed well. Unlike Tarantino's other plot driven films like ""Kill Bill"" or ""Django Unchained"" there's no emotional investment in the overall story. After the first forty-five minutes the movie loses you as a viewer until the sensational third act - which thankfully is well worth the long wait.All in all ""Jackie Brown"" showcases what's great about Tarantino - and what's not so great about Tarantino. There's more good than bad: the acting, directing, and writing is just good enough to overcome poor pacing and an uninteresting plot. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Also, it focuses too much on the intricate game the characters play, when it should have focused more on relations between characters. The eponymous Jackie Brown is so likeable and captivating, she should have been given more things to do besides plotting and dealing with the police.

Tarantino's Underrated Masterpiece,"Jackie Brown is an exceptional film that showcases the brilliance of Quentin Tarantino's directing skills. Although it is often considered Tarantino's most underrated film, it is certainly one of his best. The movie boasts a star-studded cast, including Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bridget Fonda, who all deliver outstanding performances.The plot centers around Jackie Brown, a flight attendant who gets caught up in a dangerous game between a ruthless arms dealer and the law. However, the movie is much more than just a crime thriller. Tarantino masterfully weaves together a complex web of relationships and motivations that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish.What sets Jackie Brown apart from Tarantino's other movies is its subtlety. The film is a departure from his usual fast-paced, hyper-violent style, and instead, it focuses on character development and dialogue. Tarantino's signature sharp dialogue is on full display, as the characters engage in witty and often hilarious banter.Pam Grier shines as Jackie Brown, a character who is both tough and vulnerable. She brings a depth to the role that is rarely seen in female characters in action films. Robert Forster is also fantastic as Max Cherry, the bail bondsman who becomes Jackie's ally. The chemistry between Grier and Forster is electric, and their scenes together are some of the movie's best.Jackie Brown is an excellent film that deserves more recognition than it gets. It is a masterpiece of storytelling, acting, and directing that showcases the best of Tarantino's talents.

A semi all-star cast, with all of the actors clearly ""playing themselves.""  A deadly boring story, little action, and it all goes on for far, far too long.I simply wasn't interested enough to put in the energy required to follow the plot, and so as the film progressed I knew less and less about what was happening.  Despite the ""realistic feel"" (which on deeper examination seems carefully contrived), I cared nothing for any of the characters (in fact, I found most of them quite irritating, especially the two detectives) and I kept waiting for something interesting to happen (eventually, almost praying for something interesting to happen).  Unfortunately, nothing did.  There are those who might enjoy this movie, I suppose, but I thought it was a complete dud, about as interesting to watch as plain, unsalted white rice is to eat.  5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

Another excellent masterpiece by Tarantino,"This film further solidifies Quentin Tarantino as one of the best motion picture directors in the business, and even adds a new dimension to his repertoire, as he was able to take a well done Elmore Leonard novel and make it into a well done feature length film. Jackie Brown is an absolutely stellar film for five main reasons, the first of which is the casting for the film. The stars assembled for this movie are the some of the most unlikely collection of names, with many of them playing roles that differ greatly from most of the roles they have played in the past. This movie proved that Pam Grier still has what it takes as a successful actress, and Samuel L. Jackson was an outstanding foil for her character. Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, and Bridget Fonda are very strong secondary roles, but the most suprisingly uncharacteristic role is that of Robert De Niro, who's character is almost nothing like any of the previous characters he has played in his illustrious career. It was certainly a huge departure for him, and he played it very well. Secondly, this movie has very good cinematography, which is something Tarantino has made a habit of maintaining in all of his feature films. The angle preferences give the movie a very good edge and serve to help the storyline well. Third, this movie has unexpected twists, similar to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs in the sense that you don't see them coming, but when they happen, you see exactly why they happen and how they work. None of Tarantino's movies are predictable and they often push the envelope in terms of what you expect to see, and that's an edge that he will always have in his career. Fourth, the plot is intelligently simple, yet deceptively complicated. On the surface, the story is all about money, drugs, and guns, and what makes it complicated is the twisted nature of the consequences that come from each of the characters' involvement. Some of the characters in this movie never even meet each other, yet what they do and whatever actions they take directly affect the actions of the others, another trait that exists in Tarantino's previous films. Finally, the soundtrack is outstanding. The use of classic soul songs like Bobby Womack's ""Across 110th Street,"" ""Natural High"" by Bloodstone, and ""Street Life,"" by The Crusaders featuring Randy Crawford really serve to give this movie an identity that is distinctly different from Tarantino's other pictures. This movie has great emotion and a unique level of suspense as a result of the music, without the use of dramatic scores and orchestrations, which really is a trait that Tarantino uses in all of his movies to give them their own identities. The bottom line is that Quentin Tarantino is a master of film directorial prowess, and Jackie Brown is simply another masterpiece to add to his collection.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Character-driven crime drama with Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Forster","RELEASED IN 1997 and directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Jackie Brown"" is a crime drama about a middle-aged flight attendant, the eponymous Brown (Pam Grier), who smuggles huge sums of cash from Mexico to L.A. for a too-cool arms dealer, Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson). When she's caught by two agents (Michael Keaton & Michael Bowen) they propose a deal to apprehend the dealer in exchange for her freedom. In the meantime Ordell enlists an aging bondsman, Max Cherry (Robert Forster), to release her with the aim of eradicating her. Brown knows Ordell's wicked intentions and devises a plan to not only survive the life-or-death situation, but come out the richer for it. Bridget Fonda plays Ordell's hot white babe and Robert De Niro his fresh-out-of-prison pal.This is Tarantino's most realistic film, so don't expect his typical cartoonish-ness and buckets of blood. There are occasional flashes of violence, but this is mostly a talk-driven drama. Interesting dialogues have always been one of Tarantino's strengths and so it is here. Grier is a distinguished protagonist while Fonda is smoking in her Daisy Dukes. De Niro's character is in a post-prison stupor, but you know he's still very formidable, which one character is too dull to realize. Bottom Line: ""Jackie Brown"" may not be as eventful as ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) or ""Django Unchained"" (2012), but it's a very good crime drama and unique in Tarantino's oeuvre.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours & 34 minutes and was shot in the greater Los Angeles area (e.g. Venice Beach, Carson, Torrance, Compton, Carson & Hawthorne). WRITERS: Tarantino wrote the script based on Elmore Leonard's 1992 novel ""Rum Punch"" (the only film he wrote based on a previous work).GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Entertaining but not a Masterpiece,"My Rating: *** out of ****.When it came out there was no doubt that people would be disappointed by Jackie Brown, Quentin Tarantino's follow up to his masterpiece, Pulp Fiction. People thought by some miracle that Jackie Brown would be the masterpiece that Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction was. Sadly, it was not the case and Jackie Brown did not receive half the critical praise or the box office that Pulp did.Unfortunately, while Jackie Brown is entertaining in its own right, has a brilliant performance by Samuel L. Jackson, and has some great lines of dialogue, it is not a masterpiece. The good news is that it is a good film and definitely worth watching. It was just unfortunate enough that it would be compared to Pulp Fiction.The difference between this and Tarantino's other films is that this is an adaptation of the Elmore Leonard novel, Rum Punch. Admittedly, I have not read the book so I can't compare the two. Leonard is supposedly famous for the snappy dialogue he writes. Tarantino admits that he is somewhat influenced by Leonard. So its kind of hard to tell if the dialogue here is Tarantino's or if its Leonards but there are some great lines here. Theres actually a conversation that really stands out. Its a conversation about hiding in a trunk, whether this is Leonards or Tarantino's, its got classic written all over it. Unfortunately, while there are some great lines here, theres not nearly as much as there was in Pulp Fiction.Samuel L. Jackson has always been one of my favorite actors. I have yet to see him turn in a bad performance. His work as Ordell Robbie ranks with the best I have seen from him. Its a compelling, mesmerizing performance that rivals his performance in Pulp Fiction as his best work.No one in the cast matches Jackson's performance but they give solid support. Many people have said that the best performances given in the film were done by Pam Grier and Robert Forster. While I thought that both did solid jobs, I didn't find anything remarkable about their performances. Despite being somewhat underused, Robert De Niro gives an entertaining performance. Bridget Fonda is also well cast as a pothead.Stylistically, this is a toned down Tarantino film. The film moves at a slower, deliberate pace. Tarantino does use a split-screen but only once and briefly. The most intriguing thing Tarantino does is show a crucial sequence in the film from three different perspectives. I am not exactly sure of the reason behind this but it was interesting.Overall, Jackie Brown is an entertaing film that even though its not a masterpiece I would still like to see it again. I did think it could have used a little trimming towards the end but perhaps its because I saw it on TV and it was with all those damn commercials. I may review this film again after I watch it on DVD. So if I do feel different in anyway expect a changed review.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Jackie Brown lacks the cool edge that RD and PF have.,"Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's third feature length film, and the only one is his roster that's not an original screenplay. And this is why, in my opinion, it's his least- best work. It's still a solid piece of work, but by filming an adaption Tarantino doesn't get the chance to break free like he's done with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. JB contains only fleeting moments of absurdity and outrageousness, toned down as if to keep the director in check. Jackie (Pam Grier) an air hostess, is forced to smuggle money from Mexico to L.A by the unconvincing weapons dealer Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson). Betrayal and double crossings ensue. Agent Nicolette (Michael Keaton) is on her case. Others involved include a bail bonds accountant (Robert Forster) and a couple of Ordell's friends (Robert De Niro and Bridget Fonda). A good hour could be cut from the 154 minute running time to make it quick, snappy and enthralling. Instead it drags in the 2nd act, and by that time, I had to pause, and split Jackie Brown in to parts. Of all of Tarantino's films, this is one I won't be rushing back to.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of Tarantino's better offerings,"I get that Tarantino is a ""Marmite"" Director and his work for me is often too gory and stylistic for its own good. Here however there is less gore and more character development and storyline. Pam Grier is outstanding in the lead role. She elevated the film beyond my expectations and conveys a mix of intelligence, style and allure that keeps you rooting for Jackie. Robert Forster is excellent too as the smitten bail bondsman drawn into trying to help Jackie out and was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. As usual there's a winning soundtrack to accompany the action. There's also an interesting out of type casting of Michael Keaton as a government agent.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nod to blaxploitation films,"I didn't think there was much depth to the characters or much attention given to the script. It is hard to believe that this was based on a novel. Compared to Quentin Tarantino's other films this just doesn't measure up. I realize that this is a nod to blaxploitation films. I am not a fan of that type of film so maybe that is why I couldn't really appreciate Jackie Brown. Robert DeNiro is such a great actor, he should not be settling for such 'nobody' roles. Samuel L. Jackson did his best with what he was given. I like the way he changes his looks to fit each character he plays. I am glad that Pam Grier managed to keep her shirt on, literally! If you have ever seen Pam Grier in her blaxploitation films she is constantly running around bare-chested, it's ridiculous.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
A steady burn,"My first viewing of Jackie Brown, years ago, confused me. I was expecting time jumps, and I kept asking myself when things were happening. I was trying to rearrange a movie that needed to rearranging.I mention that uninteresting anecdote because it speaks to the interesting, slightly out of step, place Jackie Brown holds in Quentin Tarantino's whole filmography. People threw the word ""mature"" a lot at Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood as though Tarantino had never calmed down before, but Jackie Brown is the work of a filmmaker in complete control of his craft and coolly telling a story. It's a very mature work, and it's only his third film.A small-time gunrunner living in Los Angeles named Ordell Robbie is suddenly having a bit of a problem with his business. One of his employees, Beaumont, has been picked up for a gun charge which, combined with his parole, could lead to ten years in jail. Ordell understands Beaumont's character, uses Max Cherry, a bail bondsman to get Beaumont out of jail, and then proceeds to kill him. Ordell's instinct about Beaumont's character was completely correct, though, for Beaumont had given up a slice of Ordell's business by naming Jackie Brown as Ordell's gopher.Jackie is a middle-aged black woman who works for one of the worst airlines in America as a stewardess. She supplements her income by sneaking things in from Mexico for Ordell, mostly money. Because Beaumont gave her name, the ATF is ready to meet her when she lands in Los Angeles. Ordell gets her out of prison using Max Cherry again, and Max picks Jackie up from prison and is immediately smitten by her.Jackie knows that Ordell will view her the same way that he viewing Beaumont, and she's terrified, but she's also smart. She knows that he's going to come to kill her, but she also figures out a way to get herself out of the situation. She proposes a plan to him to get his stash of cash out of Mexico. He has limited options around this, so he accepts. She then plays both Ordell and the ATF against each other while she plans on keeping the money for herself.What follows is a delightfully twisty game of cat and mouse as Jackie ropes in Max to help her deceive both the ATF and Ordell. The whole game is played with Tarantino's classic ability to spin dialogue and his actors' abilities to sell it. Chris Tucker, apparently, told Tarantino that he would usually just say whatever he wanted in place of scripted lines, but he was going to say Tarantino's dialogue verbatim because he liked it so much. There are scenes, as in every Tarantino movie, of people just sitting around talking. This isn't merely indulgence on Tarantino's part, it's important character work that gets the audience in deeper into the world. Melanie isn't just some beach bimbo, she's a well defined beach bimbo so that when she starts egging on Louis after the big trade off (for real this time), it makes perfect sense. We know the entirety of her relationship with Louis, so we understand that she's the kind of person to egg him on and that Louis is also the kind of guy who's got bottle up rage that could come out at any moment. It makes the moment that Louis shoots Melanie both more shocking and more expected and inevitable than it otherwise would have been.The movie as a whole is that kind of low-key fun. The action of the film is around moving shopping bags under changing room doors. The handful of gunshots are shown with little blood and seem incidental to the action at hand. The characters are intelligent and talk to each other in ways that are both believable and move things forward at the same time.It's a steady burn of a movie, and a wonderful addition to Tarantino's body of work.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Could Have Been Called ""Pulp Fiction 2""","""Jackie Brown"" is another great winner from Quentin Tarantino.  Pam Grier stars as the title character who is smuggling money for arms-dealer Samuel L.

She has hatched a plan with bail-bondsman Robert Forster (Oscar-nominated) to steal a large amount of money from Jackson.  Now the chaos begins.  Tarantino's screenplay and direction are on par with his previous work in ""Pulp Fiction"".  The aforementioned actors are excellent, but so is the rest of the cast.

Doesn't feel like Tarantino.,"Jackie Brown is a very good film. I enjoyed most of it. The performances and story were also great. But despite all that, this film still has a few flaws. And the biggest one is that it doesn't feel like it has that Quentin Tarantino magic. Tarantino is one of the best film makers out there, and its because of his unique style that most directors don't have. His over the top gore scenes and his long and tense scenes filled with sharp dialogue are what Jackie Brown is missing. Its why I didn't gave it a nine and its why its not one of Tarantino's better films. Also it seemed like it needed to be a bit shorter. There are a few story elements that didn't work and had the chance to do something else with it but didn't. And Samuel L. Jackson's performance seemed a little too much and unnecessary, even for him. But I still have to say that the music was really good as usual in Tarantino films.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not Tarantino's strongest movie, but has the energy not to forget who he is","""Jackie Brown"" was released in the holidays of 1997 where a lot of people were expecting to see another Quentin Tarantino masterpiece, but were left short of luck by the bad press and the long timing compared to the ninety minute ""Reservoir Dogs"" or the wild kinetic one-hundred fifty four minutes ""Pulp Fiction."" It was slumped due to the fact that the film came out on Oscar season where the majority of critics and fans were cheering for ""Titanic"", ""As Good as it Gets"", ""Good Will Hunting"", ""The Full Monty"", and ""L.A. Confidential."" Not to mention the comparisons of Pulp Fiction and seeing how there was no point besides the fact that Tarantino resurrected a few actors (Pam Grier, Robert Forester) and making references to pop culture along with having dead songs back to life.Pam Grier plays the title role in which she's an airline flight attendant for one of the most crappiest airport corporations in the world while still making a living. She gets caught up in a scandal after gun dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) kills a criminal who was connected with Jackie along with possession of drugs and fifty-thousand dollars in an envelope. Ordell bails her out and has plans with Jackie on her not to talk to any cops before she gets popped.Other characters include Max Cherry (Robert Forester) a bail bonds man who not only sees Ordell nearly everyday of his life, but has a small attraction with Jackie Brown. Louis Gara (Robert De Niro) just got out of jail after doing time for a bank robbery where he finds Ordell's mistress Melenie (Bridget Fonda) to be a pain in the ass. Michael Bowen and Michael Keaton play the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) cops who want to protect Jackie, but Keaton's character shows more coolness.Though this film isn't Quentin's strongest movie, it somehow manages to be entertainable to most fans. Some scenes make you laugh while other scenes will probably have you either guessing what will happen next to each character.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
... when Quentin was king,"Despite the inevitable backlash against Tarantino, and regardless of whether you approve of his violence/bad language/self-referencing narratives, I firmly believe the cinema owes him a huge debt.For I genuinely believe that the 1980s were the worst decade in history for the modern motion picture. The ""high concept pitching"" of films that could be summed up literally in two lines, with functional dialogue and A to B plotting had caused a serious slump in creative output, and audiences were being patronised by what substandard fare was being pumped into the cinemas.In 1992 Quentin entered the scene with Reservoir Dogs (9). Okay, it's heavily indebted to foreign film, but the real-time/time-bending conceits of the movie, coupled with naturalistic dialogue that gave characterisation broke down the rot. Okay, films with plot and character were all the rage in the 60s, 70s, 50s even. But the 80s had forgotten how to do it, and Quentin gave it back to us. Now I'm sure everyone could tell me there's another film writer-director that did it first, but Quentin was the one to popularise it. He capitalised on Dogs with the more commercial, more indulgent, more juvenile, but ultimately much more fun Pulp Fiction (10). Without these films we would never have seen such fare as The Usual Suspects, with it's wordy script and time-bending, and this would never have bled on to the dying British film scene with movies like the successful Trainspotting. There were other successes, too, such as by far and away the greatest Tarantino film not directed by Tarantino, True Romance (7). Starring Christian Slater (who allegedly gives 10% in royalties to Jack Nicholson for every performance), it lost the downbeat ending and time distortions, but Quentin was said to be satisfied with the linear narrative of this 93 movie. His first real film script (discounting an incomplete student project, ""My Best Friend's Birthday""), it was completed in 1987 and went for years before being taken up. It showcased some of his best dialogue and Hollywood satire; Tony Scott's more laid-back direction actually giving greater chance for the writing to shine. And for a film that also features Dennis Hopper, Christopher Walken, Brad Pitt, Val Kilmer, Gary Oldman and Balki out of Perfect Strangers, it didn't feel crammed. Amazingly, I still know of people that won't see it as they think by the title that it's a romantic comedy.However, the nature of the films and the fact that Tarantino did so much in so little time meant a backlash wasn't only inevitable, but in certain quarters, eagerly awaited. Experimental, between-film follies such as Four Rooms didn't help, and when Jackie Brown emerged, three years after Pulp Fiction, it seemed as if his time had passed. Jackie Brown (7) was a smoother, maturer direction for Tarantino. The first of his films not to come from his own ideas, but from a source text, Elmore Leonard's Rum Punch, it was a new direction. Interestingly, aged 15 Quentin had been caught trying to unsuccessfully hustle a copy of Leonard's ""The Switch"" from a shopping mall. Many of his previous films did use the oft touted ""magpie technique"" of borrowing. Ringo Lam's City of Fire has often been brought up in conversation against Reservoir Dogs and the ""Butch"" segment of Pulp Fiction was a reworked version of Roger (Killing Zoe) Avary's ""Pandemonium Reigned"". Yet this was a fully-fledged adaptation, Miramax having bought him the rights to four Leonard novels in 1995. (The other three being Killshot, Bandits and Freaky Deaky. Quentin's original plan was to make Killshot, starring himself, Bruce Willis and Holly Hunter).Of course, many don't appreciate a film that has in it's range Robert DeNiro, yet underuses him, and Samuel L. Jackson, who is given plenty to say, but nothing as incendiary as Ezekiel 25:17. There is only one time-break, where a single scene is played out three times in the same bracket, and only one kitsch moment, where an animated plane is used to paper the gaps in a $5 million-higher-than-Pulp-Fiction-but-still-very-low $13 million budget. Violence is almost non-existent by Q's standards, and the subjects discussed range not from burger bars to the Fantastic Four but the fear of ageing and the Delphonics. Top of the bill is a long-term idol of Quentin's, Pam Grier, who is even name-checked in Reservoir Dogs. It's an altogether more relaxed, more controlled film, and in many ways the writing is stronger. The easy option of a sketch-style format for his script is discarded, making it, in a sense, a better film. Yet people claim it to be worse. Strange. A genuinely touching romance at times, the only comment this one got was ""it's nothing compared to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction"". Quentin, it seems, is a victim of his own success.And so it is that we now await his fourth writer/director vehicle, another Leonard piece, ""40 Lashes"". Fingers are crossed that it will a superb return to form, though maybe it doesn't really matter. Even if Quentin's time were over, he would still have achieved a wide-scale revitalisation of American cinema. However, it would be fortunate if 40 Lashes did live up to its promise, if only to put the ghosts of Tarantino failures to rest. But that's another story. The time",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An underrated Tarantino classic,"I finally got round to watching Tarantino's third film, Jackie Brown (1997), for the first time the other day and, as always, he did not disappoint. The dialogue, as expected, was always either funny, tense, exciting or a combination of the three and the ensemble cast work exceptionally well together. Though it's hard to narrow it down, the two highlight performances of the film are definitely Pam Grier's sympathetic antihero Jackie Brown and Sam Jackson's charismatic arms dealer Ordell. Both actors embody their roles with so much charm you'd hardly need any more standout characters, but Robert Forster, Michael Keaton and De Niro are all there threatening to steal the show in their supporting roles. I can't think of much negative stuff to say about the film. The pacing felt right, the dialogue was great, the acting was first class and the soundtrack invigorates the whole thing with an epic disco vibe.

Jackie Brown is another Tarantino classic!,"Quentin Tarantino has written and directed some of the best movies in the last 25 years, starting with Reservoir Dogs and all the way up through the Kill Bill movies. Each of his films has a distinctive quality about it, whether it's the violence or the harsh language, but the thing everyone remembers most is the dialogue between characters.In Jackie Brown, Tarantino takes us for a ride as we follow Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), a flight attendant helping an arms dealer named Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) get money where it needs to be. After a flight, she is pull aside by two cops, one being Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton), who find the cash she is smuggling in for Ordell. Now she faces jail time and Ordell must get rid of somebody who might snitch. What happens now is the bail bondsman Max Cherry(Robert Forster) and Brown team up to mess with Ordell and his two pot smoking companions, Melanie (Bridget Fonda) and Louis Gara (Robert De Niro). Now it's a nice plot of how Ordell wants the half a million dollars he has coming to him with these arms deals and how Jackie Brown is the only connection between Ordell and the police and Cherry.Tarantino once again delivers the goods with this film. The movie starts off with a great dialogue between Jackson and De Niro about guns. The rest of the movie is very entertaining. Whenever Grier and Jackson talk, it's a good scene because the two have no idea what the other is about to do to the other one. They are both a little stressed out over the fact that the money isn't in the right place and are trying their best not to get each other pinched.This movie received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor (Robert Forster) and many good reviews. Forster isn't the only one giving a great performance. De Niro, Fonda, Jackson, Grier, Keaton, even Chris Tucker who is in the movie for probably less than five or ten minutes gives a notable performance.The whole ensemble is incredibly well casted and deserves to be recognized.Jackie Brown is vintage Tarantino. This film is over shadowed by his other giants (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2), but still is a great film. Tarantino is one of the best writers of recent cinema and this piece shines. Another great script from Tarantino, a fun plot, and an incredible cast give this movie something to be proud of.

Light and weaker than Quentin Tarantino's other works,"When many hear the name Quentin Tarantino, odds are they are thinking of something of a masterpiece or at least something close to such. It's very difficult to deny this director has a God-given talent in filmmaking and storytelling, and the accolades he's achieved in his past twenty years of his career. This is not to say he's immune to some duds. Though his director has not yet been subject to any cinematic failures, a few of his works have proved to be less memorable and more shallow than others. Jackie Brown, a film following the success of the highly acclaimed masterpiece 'Pulp Fiction', feels less of Tarantino's style and much less excitement than his other works. Pam Grier plays the titular character, a middle-aged flight attendant who's tasked by arms dealer Ordell Robbie (played by Samuel L. Jackson) to smuggle $10,000,000 from Mexico to Los Angeles. When she's unexpectedly caught and arrested by two FBI agents (played by Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen) in attempt to smuggle a million dollars worth of cocaine in her purse, she is sentenced to prison but is ultimately released when she makes a deal with the agents to capture and arrest Ordell. Upon learning of Ordell's sinister plot, Jackie acquires the help of business fund manager Max Cherry (played by Robert Forster) to steal $1,000,000 from Ordell.Quentin Tarantino follows relatively the same style of filmmaking similar to his other works including the non-linear storytelling and interconnected story lines but manages to cut back on the over-the-top graphic violence that he's often known for, watering it down what feels like PG level in comparison. The film offers a plot that pays homages to 70s blaxploitation flicks. While there is plenty of substance to be experienced, the plot supplements little excitement and conveys at an unnecessarily slow pace, clocking at a 152 runtime that feels more like three hours. Without any sort of suspense or thrills to offer, the plot conceives a rather lack of tension. Quentin Tarantino is known for generating some of the most clever stories on film, particularly what we brought to 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction'. Unfortunately, much of the excitement conceived in those films is abandoned here. Luckily, there are a few twists and surprises sprinkled throughout that at least present some redeeming quality. The aspect in which the film greatly succeeds however, is building up strong character development along with some talented acting from an above-average cast. Pam Grief shows off an convince vibe as Jackie Brown. It may stand inside the Oscar range but there's no denying her performance shines. Samuel L. Jackson, returning to the Tarantino fare from 'Pulp Fiction' is good as ever, adopting his typical boldface personality. Robert Forster also comes off as impressive with his performance. The biggest disappointment though, is Robert De Niro who plays Samuel L. Jackson's sidekick and is decidedly underused for what could have been a compelling role for an actor like him.Jackie Brown doesn't quite scale the ladder like Quentin Tarantino's other films but there is some smarts to be experienced in what is a worthy effort by Tarantino, even if it doesn't succeed at a narrative scale. Those who are Tarantino fans are recommended to watch this, everyone else though will most likely to left with a shortage of entertainment.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

There are some holes in the caper that the movie is centered on, but there is an amazing love of story and cinema by the man who brings us this tale, and I think it is a genius who happened to be at his peek at this particular moment.As well as Tarantino's genius, we get some great performances by some gifted actors. Among the great performances was Robert De Niro's brilliant performance as a pathetic man totally beaten up by life and prison. I suspect that many movie goers had difficulty with De Niro's performance at the time because it was so opposite of the confident character we came to know from his portrayals in his films prior to this one. Samuel Jackson's great performance owes quite a bit to De Niro. These characters just seem to naturally belong to and deserve each other.I have to ultimately judge this movie on the fact that I keep returning to it. I've watched it a dozen times and I'll watch it another dozen times or more before I'm done.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Quentin Tarantino + Elmore Leonard= Quality,"Jackie Brown (Quentin Tarantino's third movie) is a movie that grows on you. I tried to watch this for the first time expecting another wildly violent Tarantino flick. After an hour, I was bored. Well, I gave it a second chance and a few viewings later, I've come to a conclusion: I love this movie.The plot is based on an Elmore Leonard novel called Rum Punch. The plot is way too complicated to explain here in full detail. Basically it is about an aging bailbondsman (Robert Forster) bored with his dead end job who helps smuggler Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) frame her boss and run off with his money. After she is arrested, her boss, Ordell Robbie, (an arms dealer played by Samuel L. Jackson) bails her out with the intention of using her for one last job and then killing her. Jackie Brown, however, has other plans. There are also a bunch of interesting subplots involving the cops (Micheal Keaton in particular) and Ordell's not-too-bright accomplices,(Rovert DeNiro and Bridget Fonda) who plan to keep the money for themselves and kill Ordell. The excellent plot is combined with Tarantino's trendy dialogue to help develop the great cast of characters. The movie moves along at a slow pace, so you have to be patient when watching it. If you are expecting a ""typical"" QT flick, you will hate it. It does not use any gratuitous violence (there is some violence, but it is realistically portrayed) or weird gimmicks such as Japanese anime. The plot focuses on just one character, who is not only likable but a good person, not a murderer like in Dogs or Fiction. The performances were excellent, Pam Grier convinced me as Jackie Brown and Sam Jackson is a great villain. There was also a great supporting cast. The soundtrack was awesome too, its a lot of 70s soul/funk...not a genre I'm familiar with, since I'm an 80s baby, but I loved it in the context of the movie. This is the most underrated of Tarantino's movies and my favorite.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

a refreshing change of pace,"The people who were disappointed with this film were probably thinking, ""How dare Quentin Tarantino make something other than 'Pulp Fiction 2' after making it big?"" Which is a very narrow-minded way to look at things.This is Tarantino's Elmore Leonard adaptation / blaxploitation homage / Pam Grier worship movie. It doesn't grab your attention like his previous two films, and that's because here he slows down so as to draw more detailed characters. He's abetted by the actors, who turn in rich, flavourful performances, including Robert De Niro, who makes his character goofy and very funny.There are only two things holding this movie back. This is the first time Tarantino isn't doing his own thing - it's an adaptation, and this seems to have led him to be a little too self-conscious in terms of style. Also, the film could afford to be ten-fifteen minutes shorter.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Underrated Look At Desperate People,"Quentin Tarantino knows what he likes when making a movie, and what he likes are actors and actresses that once had a career, and then fell off the radar. Jackie Brown stars two actors that fit that mold, Pam Grier, the 70s blaxploitation star, and Robert Forster, who gives an Oscar nominated performance. Grier plays the title character, Jackie Brown, who's an stewardess for the worst airline that connects between her home of Los Angeles and Cabo San Lucas. After her criminal past, she lives on her $16,000 salary, picking up a few dollars by running money from Mexico to her contact in LA, played by the always dependable Samuel L. Jackson. Robert Forster plays a worn down, 50ish year old bail bondsman who meets Jackie while picking her up from jail after she's caught with drugs with the money headed to Jackson's character. While this film boasts the most plot of any of Tarantino's movies, it is still not the most important part of the film. The interaction between two lost souls over the age of 40, and how they try to outsmart their enemies (gun dealers, the feds, the police) is fun to watch. Some complain that at 2 hours 30 minutes it's too long, but I disagree. The length allows the characters to talk to each other, not just about plot points, but to also just talk. The film also features Bridget Fonda as a beach bum, Robert De Niro as a baked ex-con in a truly funny, if not subdued role, and Michael Keaton as an ATF agent who thinks he knows how to handle Jackie Brown. Jackie Brown is on one level about an airline worker smuggling money into the country for her boss, but on a more important level, how desperate and tired people of a certain age will act when the chance is there to make a change in their life.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
'Jackie Brown' Will Please Anyone Who Watches Her (It). * * * * (Out Of 4),"Three years after the huge success of the pop-culture phenomenon ""Pulp Fiction"", Quentin Taratino serves up a quiet little success named ""Jackie Brown"", which I found, is more pleasing in substance the ""Pulp Fiction"", and many other films. On a slight homage to blaxploitation films of the 70's, he gives us a drab, seedy region in California, where we meet the most complex and colorful characters, including Ms. Brown. What really hits you hard is the interest in these character, their emotions, their behaviors, their life. It's one amazing film.The main character, as you already know, is Jackie Brown, a stewardess who works in California. In her mid-40's, Jackie knows a man by the name of Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) who is an illegal gun merchant. Jackie and Ordell are connected to the same bail-bondsman by the name of Max Cherry (Robert Forster in an unbelievable performance). With Ordell's wealth of cash from his sell's, he hires Jackie to import them into California from Mexico (Where her flights come and go). The police however, are catching on to Ordell, and one cop by the name of Ray (Michael Keaton), is on Jackie's trail. Along for the ride is Ordell's ex-con friend Louis (Robert DeNiro) and one of Ordell's stoned-out-of-her-mind girlfriends, Melanie (Bridget Fonda). These six players are all on the trail of Ordell's half a million dollar profit, and like the DVD box exclaims ""The only questions are...who's going to get played...and who's going to make the big score?"".Quentin has a habit of resurrecting aging star's careers, such as Travolta's with ""Pulp Fiction"", but this time around he does it twice, with extraordinary performances from Pam Grier and Robert Forster. There's even a subtle romance between Jackie and Max. Even Ray, the cop, has an eye on Jackie. And it's within these subtle hints of the script that we get into these characters and feel for them. It's amazing what Quentin can do with them, and how each speech between two characters has such immense importance.What's a great shock is the feel of how the movie takes it's time and does not rush to it's ending. It takes in as much as it wants, and so do we. The film is a long film, about 2 and 1/2 hours long, and yet we don't mind how long it takes, because we're not looking for the end. We're studying each scene with precision, admiring the character development. The ending is a cool, classy, laid-back approach. No startling revelations, but a very satisfying feel.The soundtrack features the soul and sound of the 70's with featured bands like The Delfonics. The opening and closing will give you a great smile, and it's because of how Quentin chooses his musical arrangements. I could not have been happier to hear the music being played for the ending. I savored every moment of Jackie Brown and you should too.My Ratings: * * * * (Out Of 4) A+ (A+ Being The Highest, F Being The Lowest) 10 (On the IMDb.Com's scale, 1 being the lowest)",,Anonymous,Crime

Cinema Omnivore - Jackie Brown (1997) 7.8/10,"""As per Tarantino's penchant, JACKIE BROWN is awash with dialogues rambling on and on, most eloquently symbolized by Jackson's ponytailed (and later unloosed), braided-goateed Ordell, whose vicious streak becomes a persistent undertone beneath his street-gang verbiage. Whether he is chewing the fat with his slightly-obtuse cohort Louis Gara (De Niro, cast against the type), or talking shop with the cool-as-the-cucumber bail bondsman Max Cherry (Forster), he is vigilant as a squirrel, slippery as a snake and heartless as an ice icicle. Therefore, one finds it difficult to credit Ordell would so tactlessly rise to the bait in the climax, although his downfall is exactly what audience expects, the script doesn't prepare us for such an expedient method, which may be viewed as a cop-out by some, since plot intricacy is Tarantino's forte.""-",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Foxy Grier,"""Jackie Brown"" was widely received as a disappointing follow-up to Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction,"" but I think it's actually a better movie, if less obviously so. It's hard not to be blown away by ""Fiction"" because of it's sheer audacity; ""Jackie Brown"" is a quieter film that shows Tarantino has the potential to become a mature and sophisticated director. It's somewhat ironic that Tarantino, associated with the young hipster audience, made this film, because at the basic level ""Jackie Brown"" is about getting old. All of Jackie's motivations spring from the fact that starting over will soon become impossible for her. That the options available to a a middle-aged, lower income level, black woman in modern America are severely limited. Tarantino shows an amazing prowess for getting into the head of this woman. His sensitive direction coupled with Pam Grier's top-notch performance combine to make Jackie one of the most compelling and honest female characters to hit the movie screen in recent years.The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent too. Robert Forster stands out as bail bondsman Max Cherry, who becomes Jackie's partner in crime, as it were. Samuel L. Jackson does well with the kind of part he seems born to play, but his character is not as interesting as the others and so makes less of an impression. Bridget Fonda is a scene stealer as a California beach bunny, and the contrast between her and Pam Grier is used quite effectively.It's interesting to note that in the book this movie was based on, ""Rum Punch"" by Elmore Leonard, Jackie was white. Changing the race of the title character to black adds a whole other dimension to the film that the book lacks. This is one case where the movie greatly improves on its source material.""Jackie Brown"" will take some commitment on behalf of the viewer. It's leisurely paced and more reliant on character study than Tarantino's other films, but these aren't detriments. They merely illustrate that Tarantino has some range as a director, and I hope he continues to explore that range.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Slick characters and slick dealings in one perfectly executed film,"I never thought that I would actually like a Quentin Tarantino movie, let alone think that it's a brilliant film that should be revered. ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) was entertaining but most of his other violent, ridiculous ""artistry"" I couldn't even sit through. ""Jackie Brown"" though, gives us some powerful characters to connect to, a drug and money plot which for the most part makes sense, and relatively, very little violence.The eponymous Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a 44 year-old black woman, but I can't describe her using Samuel L. Jackson's words because they are all expletives. I am hoping that I'm allowed to laugh at Jackson's many racial, blasphemous, and offensive declarations because they were hilarious.The majority of the comedy is when we are being introduced to all the characters at the beginning of the film. Once we establish that Ordell (Jackson) is a very ruthless, rich arms-dealer, then we establish that Jackie Brown might be more like the opposite of him, a hard-working stewardess trying to make right in society. But they're friends and she's caught with his money and cocaine.After giving us some rich characters, we then get a plot. A plot which involves some very shady connections, and under-handing and double-crossing. But we're given everything we need to know so it's easy to follow, and then we get to guess who is actually working for whom and who is defrauding whom. And every single one of these potentially-suspicious characters is played by a great actor in a role seemingly made for them.""Jackie Brown"" is filmmaking at its best with these vibrant characters, engaging story and the detailed use of style, song choice, and framing of shots to keep all of the connections alive.

Attention to detail is Tarantino's greatest asset,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching Jackie Brown, where each character is so reachable and believable you would be forgiven for thinking you're watching real life instead of a movie. Tarantino is very skilled at grabbing an audience's attention early and once he's got you, you're there to stay. Pam Grier is the sassy Jackie Brown who is impossible not to warm to, even if some of the things she does we would never do, but wish we could. Samuel L Jackson I must admit is not an actor I usually take on board, but in this as the ruthless Ordell Robbie he excels and it's by far the best role I've seen him in. As well, I'm not a fan of Michael Keaton. I didn't think he was suited as Batman as he doesn't have the strong physique or persona to wear the sacred cape, but he surprised me here with his assuredness and ease in which he portrays a cop, on the hunt for Ordell. Robert De Niro pitches in with timely humour as Ordell's live-in partner in crime and I was captivated by Bridget Fonda, the surfer girlfriend of Ordell, with her casual style and rocking good looks.Even though the run time is huge I was never bored or lost interest in this movie. The characters are people I wanted to know about and that really is what sets this movie apart from many others - Tarantino's incredible usage of his cast and they being more than complicent in following his direction. With just the right mix of drama, comedy, action and suspense, Jackie Brown is a cult classic. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pam Grier is an adequate actress, but I didn't think she was as hot looking as the camera seemed to think she was.  I'm not sure why people call this a ""character study"", but I think it means that since the plot is so boring, the only thing the film has to offer is interesting characters.  The big pay-off I was expecting after two hours of development was a complete disappointment.  I'm also tired of Quentin's technique of writing ""hip, street-wise"" dialogue, which consists of using the word ""nigger"" liberally.  On the plus side, Samual Jackson was fantastic.

"It's not a masterpiece, but it's a great work!","JACKIE BROWN is, like PULP FICTION, a movie written and directed by Tarantino, or by other words a work that completely came out of his mind.

However the differences are bigger. JACKIE BROWN might not be so brightly like PULP FICTION but it is a great movie full of suspense and twists.The characters are all well conceived and all of them sustain and give an extra strength to the plot. I appreciated especially three acting jobs: The one by Samuel L Jackson, which does one more time the role type he does best; Pam Grier, which plays the main role (JACKIE BROWN), and does a magnificent work playing a strong and intelligent woman that can deceive everyone and ends fulfilling her goal; and Robert De Niro role, LOUIS GARA, which is not a very important to this movie, but I appreciated it because I think he does a character with a different personality from what I'm used to watch in other movies.

Jackie Brown getting' down!!,"It may be old news now, but Quentin T. showed out in this fast and sassy maxi-scam caper flick. He couldn't have hired a better acting ensemble to pull this off, to wit, Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Sammy J., Bobby D., Brigid F., Chris Tucker, Michael K., etc.For starters, I think this is the best performance of Pam G's career: she exhibits a multi-dimensional persona here I have never seen her pull off before. For example, notice how she effortlessly segues from the street-savvy demeanor whilst in the company of Sammy J., etc., to the middle-class, nice girl, good-diction modus operandi when she's in the company of the the likes of Robert F. She shows how tight her game really is and isn't afraid to do whatever it takes to pull off her intended caper.Robert F., mild of manner and well composed, is cast as the antithesis of the Sammy J. character who is a down-and-dirty, bombastic rascal. Notice how Robert F's character, a white bail-bondsman, effortlessly mixes in well with people of color without being obsequious or trying to be hip: He is merely himself and lets that fact set the tone for whatever may ensue.Sammy J. is his usual awesome self, with great support from Bobby D. and Brigid F. That unholy trio makes sparks fly as the drama unfolds. Notice how Bobby D's character slowly shifts gears from a mellow understated ex-con to a violent shooter when he becomes unduly provoked: a nice touch from Mr. DeNiro.Quentin T's usually crisp directorial skills are in evidence here, as his cutting in and moving back and forth in time work very well. His rewinds in time allow the viewer to see the same scenes from another vantage point so that one can see the logical progression of events from several angles. All that and an awesome, cleverly positioned soundtrack that kicks much booty! How about ""Across 110th Street"" at the ending?

Accept no substitutes!,"Quentin Tarantino's third movie is his first literary adaptation, based on a novel written by his favorite author, Elmore Leonard (QT was actually offered the chance to direct another Leonard story, Get Shorty, which would have been perfect for him). The movie is Jackie Brown, and it's Tarantino's most mature effort so far (N.B. By ""most mature"" I don't mean ""best"", as I still prefer Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill, particularly Volume 2), with real characters who feel real emotions and speak as they would in real life (the trademark speeches are awesome, but honestly, who talks like that at home?).At the center of the story is Jackie Brown (Pam Grier), an air hostess who also works for gangster Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson). She gets caught by two federal agents (Michael Keaton and Michael Bowen) who force her to cooperate if she wants to keep her job. A new who-gets-what game is about to start...As usual with Tarantino, a lot of the movie's strength lies in the writing: the realistic dialogue is a joy for the ear, and in terms of plot structure, every single character is important, from Keaton's cop to Chris Tucker's unlucky crook, and no one is there to merely serve the script; they're all interesting, human beings we will remember. And the actors who bring those people to life are extraordinary: former blaxploitation star Grier is of course the best, and her character's romance with bail bondsman Max Cherry (the Oscar-nominated Robert Forster) is one of the most convincing ever filmed. In the villain department, Sam Jackson shines as gun expert Ordell (""AK-47. When you got to absolutely, positively kill every motherf**ker in the room, accept no substitutes.""), and Robert De Niro (cast against type) makes a believable sidekick.Not as weird, innovative and fascinating as QT's other works, but absolutely, positively worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Excellent, not disappointing at all","Director Quentin Tarantino started his film career with the great Reservoir Dogs, then the following film he made was the excellent Pulp Fiction, then he made Jackie Brown. Some people were disappointed with this because they were expecting this to be the best movie ever made. This isn't the best movie ever made, but it still is excellent.The qualities that make a Tarantino movie are an interesting story line, style, complex characters, witty dialog, and action. This doesn't have as much action as his other movies, but it still keeps you interested the whole way through.This isn't as raw or violent as Reservoir Dogs, as flashy or showy as Pulp Fiction, or as unique as Kill Bill, but it still has a unique style.The story follows a stewardess who is smuggling money for an arms dealer. Quickly, she is wanted by the FBI and the arms dealer at the same time. There are several other things that take place, eventually making the whole plan start to back fire. This is shown mainly in chronological order, but there is one scene that jumps back a little ways from the current event.This is a great movie, for those of you who watch Tarantino movies just to watch people get shot or tortured, you might not enjoy this as much. The running time is really long at 2 1/2 hours, but it does have plenty of entertainment values that keep this movie from ever becoming boring. The music is great, it's a good collection of music from the '70's.

"Quentin hits the bulls-eye again, but in a slightly different manner","Quentin Tarantino is one smart dude. After the explosion of ""Pulp Fiction"" and everybody expecting him to make ""Pulp Fiction 2"" he offered up something that, for a name that occupies the blank after phrase 'Directed by:' on the credits list, doesn't have a lot in common with his previous masterpiece.In the years after its release ""Pulp Fiction"" has been copied so many times in other movies, that the last thing QT wanted was to copy himself and repeat what was already said.If characters in ""Pulp Fiction"" were like something out of comic book, these guys are their more mature, multi-dimensional versions. This is not to say that ""Pulp"" is inferior to ""Jackie"" but merely an observation stating the 'grown-up nature', if you will, of this movie. This is essentially a sweet and smart love story between a couple of people in their 40s - Jackie Brown, stewardess who after years of service and bad life choices has very little going for her and Max Cherry, a bail bond business operator who reached the contemplative stages of his life and is thinking of quiting his job. Of course many other characters are equally involved and each contributes a lot to the overall quality of the movie.""Jackie Brown"" works on every level, as a love story, as a crime caper, as a human behaviour study and even as a comedy (Chris Tucker has a marvelous cameo playing a thug named Beaumont Livingston).

"Slow moving crime drama, not as much action as Pulp Fiction","In Tarantino's third film, Pam Grier stars as Jackie Brown, who is arrested for bringing illegal money into the country which ultimately takes her into a case involving one of her close friends, gun dealer Ordell (Jackson).Once again covering the crime genre, Tarantino brings the characters and plot to life with cutting edge direction, and specific writing in a great portrayal of the crime world.A lot of crime films focus upon action and car chases at every possible opportunity but this crime drama exploits the more specific details of what gun dealers and police are like with the unnecessary action. In admiring the realism of this concept, it does last for the entire film with hardly any action and can trail off waiting for something big to happen.This may be off putting for many action viewers but the direction, script, dialogue and characters are good enough to give that little extra to put this film right up with Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill.The acting is excellent by all involved. I particularly enjoyed De Niro's (Raging Bull) performance, in perhaps an underrated role for the legendary actor. Samuel L Jackson is again good, but not as powerful as he was in his Oscar nominated role in Pulp Fiction. His character is intriguing to watch and develop as the film progresses into a more personal stage, but with the lack of action and suspense, the characters sometimes end up being a bit dull, all except for De Niro and Grier, who are the stars of the show.Grier takes centre stage as the air hostess who is under the spotlight from everyone in this film and Brown's actions and skillful planning are a joy to watch and the zest in her actions make up for the lack of suspense and action.Not Tarantino's best film, but nevertheless great portrayal of real life crime with a good sophisticated plot that will keep viewers intrigued t the very end.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Part of what made Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs so compelling was that you had the feeling they were the work of a mad genius. Anything could, and did, happen. Jackie Brown is far more pedestrian. It is by no means boring, but that same adrenaline rush that came along with, well, Uma Thurman's adrenaline rush, just isn't here. I suppose that's what Quentin was shooting for: a more subdued character piece. He would have been tarred and feathered had he made Pulp Fiction 2, so I expected a different direction. I admire him for trying something new, and on many levels he succeeded. The romance between Max and Jackie is beautifully handled and portrayed, never feeling forced or sappy. Jackie Brown called for a more relaxed pace, and it is delivered. But its director is perhaps the reigning master of cinematic chaos, and all of that energy is (wisely) held in. Let's hope Tarantino's next project allows him to really let loose, so he can do what he does best: blow our minds.",,Anonymous,Crime
Very long.,"Yep, apparently no one wanted to tell Quentin Tarantino ""no"", so we havean almost three hour movie that loses it's audience quickly. I wanted tolike it, but it's almost like he's daring us not to by staying in scenesfar too long and giving us uninpired performances. I loved RobertForster and Pam Greer, but what was DeNiro doing, and what was BridgetFonda doing? They were cliches of the thug and the bimbo, and I couldcare less about them. To me, the magic of Tarantino is taking onedimensional characters (see Pulp Fiction) and showing us a differentside of them that makes us love them and care about their stories. I gotthat with only a few of the roles in this film. I will always see thismans films, I think he's a major talent, but I hope he sticks with thelesser known actors who will really come through for him and leave the'stars' (unless it's a Travolta like comeback) to other directors.Resevoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction will remain on my shelf, but not JackieBrown. Come back Tarantino! Make another film, and make it cheap fastand out of control!",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino's most mature (and arguably best) movie to date.,"The late 90's weren't the best time to be a Tarantino fan. While peaking in the early 90's with masterpieces like Reservoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction, the mid 90's didn't show him the best light, as Four Rooms was a huge waste of potential (and Tarantino's segment was the most pointless in the film) & while From Dusk Til Dawn was a fun B-movie homage, that's all it was, and it was very forgettable in the process. And let's not even start on his horrible attempts at acting. Because of this, many felt that by this point, Tarantino was a two-trick pony and had to make something truly special in order to say otherwise. This is where Jackie Brown comes in. Despite being his least stylistic film, Jackie Brown makes up for it with strong character development, an engaging story and a great script, creating Tarantino's most mature film to date.The story is that Jackie Brown, a flight attendant, smuggles money from Mexico to the US for Ordell Robbie, a black-market gun runner in order to make extra income for herself. However, when she is arrested for smuggling drugs that she was unaware were in her bag, she decides in order to avoid jail time to help the law get Ordell in jail. However, she finds it difficult to find where her loyalties lie. The story for the most part is very engaging, as it keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen all throughout the film. While the large amount of subplots can make the film overly complicated and hard to follow at times, it is still interesting and keeps you on the edge throughout the film's duration.The characters are also very well written and demonstrate Tarantino's best character writing to date. All of the characters are three dimensional and very compelling. It also helps that all the acting is fantastic, with Pam Grier being the standout, delivering an Oscar worthy performance as someone who is struggling with what to do with her life, and will go to extreme lengths in order to have a peaceful life. Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forester, Robert De Niro, Michael Keaton among others are very good as well and Chris Tucker actually isn't annoying for once. The script is also very good as well, with great dialogue & interesting themes relating to the ideas of aging, gun violence, betrayal and many more that keep the film utterly engrossing throughout.The biggest problem for many is that this is Tarantino's least stylistic film to date. The dialogue isn't as Tarantino-esque as before, there isn't much action & the story is for the most part (except for an outstanding sequence set in a mall where a scenario happens from multiple perspectives) told in a linear fashion. To be fair, the film does feel slower than his previous films and isn't as enjoyable as them because of it (not helped by he film's overlong two and a half hour running time), but it is still engaging nonetheless, due to it's story and characters, which due to the lack of action the film has more time for. The film also has some style, as particularly highlighted with the aforementioned mall and the marvelous soundtrack, which oozes funk and soul, and is fits with the film perfectly.Overall, this is a great film. While not as good as Tarantino's previous efforts, it still is quite outstanding, due to its characters, story and acting. Too long and potentially hard to follow sometimes it may be, but it still is worthwhile viewing for any Tarantino fan, who want to see him at his most mature, and arguably best, era of film-making.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not The Excitement or Violence You Would Look For In a Tarantino Film,But Still Really Good,","Jackie Brown is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline like all Quentin Tarantino's movies and a very talented cast.I certainly didn't enjoy it as much as Tarantino's previous work,Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction,it wasn't as violent,action packed or as exciting as them and I was a bit disappointed by it,but it still is a really good movie.This focuses a lot more on characters and dialogue,which didn't bother me because I really liked these characters and the dialogue was very well written.The cast are all fantastic,Pam Grier and Robert Forster both did a fantastic job,but the best performances had to be Samuel L Jackson and Robert De Niro,their both some of my favourite actors,they always get really interested in their characters,and this is no exception.Fans of Quentin Tarantino will be disappointed by Jackie Brown,but its still a very good,character driven movie.Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) gets involved with an arms dealer and the police force after a few mistakes she made in the past that brought her into jail.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A film that somehow keeps you interested.,"Jackie Brown is a film that is not a usual kind of Tarantino film. This is the only film that Tarantino has not had any kind of gory violence, which is why I liked it. Not because it didn't have gore, but because it is unique.I first saw this movie on TV and I must say Samuel L. Jackson and Robert Forster's performances were quite impressive. (In case you didn't know, Robert Forster was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars).However, a bit of a downfall was that it had a bit too much talking, and not as much action as it should, but it kinda makes up for it with the whole idea and cleverness of it. Overall, a good film, even if you don't like Tarantino.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good,"Actually, I like it a lot. Tarantino has made another movie in his own style. It was fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino's most adult work,"Jackie Brown is probably the most adult work of director Quentin Tarantino. Although the name and star Pam Grier hint for a blacksploitation-style movie, the movie never feels like any kind of exploitation. There are numerous references to movies like Foxy Brown and many songs in the background are ripped from their soundtracks, but the movie itself is actually quite calm. It has some violence but it's not very explicit ea. it's shown off-screen. This is not how Tarantino movies usually are. Another thing that freaks us Tarantino fans out is that in the movie characters talk mainly about stuff that's related to the plot, there's barely any mention of old TV-series or Kung-fu movies of the 70's. This is why the movie also feels less Tarantino than his other work. This may be due to this being an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's the Rum Punch and not an entirely new story from QT's warped mind.All this does not make this movie a bad one. In fact it's surprising how little actually happens in the movie, it's mainly just talk until the last 40 minutes or so. Yet Tarantino clearly has a gift with words, you will always feel interested about what a character says. Speaking of characters, Tarantino has usually a marvelous cast, but this puts the likes of Pulp Fiction to shame. Pam Grier is great at the title role, Robert DeNiro gives us yet another immortal role and Samuel L. Jackson does a superb arms-dealer who thinks a little too much of himself. Yet the best performance comes from Robert Foster, who is really the heart of the movie as a bail-payer, who becomes interested in Jackie Brown's scheme to steal the money his boss wants to smuggle to America. The relationship between Foster's character and Jackie is touching, almost like Vince and Mia in Pulp Fiction, as it's an almost love-story which ends before it even starts.The plot is actually like a Seinfeld episode without the jokes. All characters seem to have different interests at first, but later all the plot points tie in together. And this time Tarantino actually tells the story linear, not by some jumps in time back and forth. It's actually a working solution for this film. We Tarantino fans got a little worried there when he made such a straight movie, quit for six years, but we certainly were rewarded as his next one was the two-volume roaring rampage of revenge, his most exploitational movie yet.**** (8/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointing,"Jackie Brown was Tarintino's only bad movie that I've seen.  Before I watched I saw the running time; 154 minutes.  I thought, well maybe it was very involved, but it was the most slow moving, drawn out, movie I've ever seen.  The only good thing in that movie was Samuel L. Jackson's performance.  Maybe I had too high of expectations for it, considering it was made by the same guy who made Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  I don't recommend this movie but if you feel you must watch it, go into it with low expectations.",,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino's Plump Fiction,"Tarantino's quirky characters and dialog can carry a film only so far. An interesting story with characters one cares about is missing here. Samuel L. Jackson does a decent imitation of his character in Pulp Fiction but lacks a John Travolta to play off of. Pam Grier is impressive looking but doesn't have the acting chops to carry a film. Robert Forester is solid but his character is a dullard. The main setting, a generic shopping mall, is as interesting as the mall in which I originally saw the film. And someone tell Tarantino if you're going to depict a scene from 3 different viewpoints, make sure the scene is worthy watching in the first place.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Absolutely brilliant,"Jackie Brown, like all of Tarantino's other films, is a masterpiece.As you'd expect from a Tarantino film, the characters are crafted perfectly, with a stacked cast to deliver the clever, funny and zippy dialogue. We are treated to Samuel L Jackson, De Niro, Keaton, Forster and a terrific performance from Pam Grier as the eponymous Jackie Brown. All of them were incredible in this film, even those will smaller parts. The chemistry was always there and the characters felt real, gritty, and lived in. A particular mention needs to go to Sam Jackson, who was so good in this film, easily his best collaboration with Tarantino.The plot was also really special. It actual feels very understated and quite compact compared to other Tarantino films, which I loved. There aren't loads of characters, and the story always had quite a narrow focus, which gave the film a great pace and feel.I also think Jackie Brown benefitted from the fact it was not very violent at all, which gave it a sense of realism and kept it grounded. Not that I'm averse to a bit of Tarantino OTT violence, but it never would have worked in this film. The script was also perfect, which really benefited the story and the character development and exploration.As for rest, well, its a Tarantino film, so expect a brilliant score, great visuals, smooth and slick direction, and of course feet.Brilliant film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
(On Pam Grier) she's Jackie just like George C. Scott was Patton and Marlon Brando was Vito Corleone,"I read some about Jackie Brown before I get to see it so I didn't get surprised either for the minimum volume of explicit violence or the smooth kind of movie I was going to see.J.B. is certainly beyond the expected: It is a clean and a very intelligent film where the perfectly portrayed atmosphere and the so amazingly conceived and interpreted characters just let the story flows clean and steady on an enchanting smooth rhythm.Jackie Brown a flight assistant which is masterly interpreted by the former 70's black exploitation diva Pam Grier and, as it is obvious, happens to be the centre of a story were as usual everyone wants a piece of the cake but one.  I can't think of other actress to play Jackie Brown, I would bet Tarantino conceived her picturing Pam playing her, she's just great she's Jackie just like George C. Scott was Patton and Marlon Brando was Vito Corleone. No further comments needed.Other character that happens to be essential is Max Cherry superbly performed by Robert Forster.  Max is the rhythm of the movie himself: Being just smooth and equilibrated he keeps the movie on an even but always thrilling elapse.The atmosphere: a very 70s LA couldn't be better sketched: Jackie's apartment, Max' office and the steak house where Jackie and Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson) have Piña coladas and Screwdrivers are simply amazing you just feel like if you have been there.That's more or less all I have to say about this picture which in my concept is simply one of the greatest movies ever.I also find remarkable the Robert De Niro role as Louis Gara an ex con who add the fun touch to the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

An Underrated Movie,"Jackie Brown is Tarantino's best film in my opinion; it is more grounded in reality and tells a compelling story. Pam Grier is excellent in the titular role, she gives an Oscar-worthy performance and is well cast and beautiful to boot. Of course Robert Forester, Sam Jackson, and Michael Keaton are perfect in their roles as well. I also like the theme and exploration of aging and how a person of humble station eventually gets to the point of not caring what may happen, all they know is that they will not be starting over again.The music is also top notch and fits the storyline well. ""Across 110th street"" is a fitting theme song about escaping the ghetto. 110th street of course divides wealthier mid-town Manhattan from the historically poorer Harlem neighborhood north of Central Park. And, of course Pam Grier starred in similar films in the 1970s (""Foxy Brown"", ""Coffy"") so she was really the only and best choice for this role. It's a shame she and the film didn't receive higher praise. And, the cinematography is well done, I loved the opening scene of her going through the airport, and the ending scene as well of her and Forster parting ways.Now, for the negative aspects which keep this movie from being a 10.0 and probably a bigger commercial success: the beach-house scenes needed cut out or edited way down. The movie is a little too long and would have been helped by some more editing. The DeNiro and Bridget Fonda characters were not necessary, or at least should have had much less screen time. Their scenes are cringe-worthy and drag on, I don't need to see them smoke or hump -- not necessary and some things could be implied later on. And the ""chicks with guns"" segment is also cringe-worthy at the beginning and should have been cut. Plus the Ordell/Beaumont conversation borders on the absurd. I feel that if Tarantino kept this a tight crime thriller grounded in reality it would have done even better, though perhaps people couldn't accept that from him right after ""Pulp Fiction"" which is as silly as its title suggest. Also, the mall scene at the end was fine, but should not have been replayed from different angles, that part dragged.Overall, I still really like this film; it is an overlooked gem. 9.0/10.0.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not Bad At All But Not As Magical As Quentin Tarantino's Finest Works Either,"The third feature film by Quentin Tarantino is also his first to be adapted from a pre-existing material instead of his self-written screenplay, and while it manages to work as his homage to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s, Jackie Brown unfortunately lacks the flamboyance & kinetic wit of Reservoir Dogs & Pulp Fiction and is one of Tarantino's less impressive works.The story of Jackie Brown is set in Los Angeles & follows its titular character, a middle-aged woman who works as a flight attendant for a small Mexican airline and earns a little extra by smuggling money for an arms dealer. Caught in the act by federal agents, she refuses to cut any deal with them and instead concocts a devious plan to get away from the mess she put herself in.Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino, Jackie Brown carries an entirely different feel when compared to his earlier works and isn't as stylish & fancy as one expects a Tarantino film to be. The story is character driven but the scripted characters themselves lack an interesting dimension. Nevertheless, the plot is consistently moving, the twists are expertly executed & it is entertaining for the most part.Coming to the performances, Jackie Brown features a wonderful cast in Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda & Robert De Niro, with Grier & Forster impressing the most in what turned out to be a career-resurrecting work for both of them plus their chemistry is pretty much on the spot as well. Jackson dominates the screen with another terrific performance while De Niro is a natural in the role of a bum.On an overall scale, Jackie Brown takes a slightly conventional route with its storytelling, is crafted in a restrained manner, and although it packs in usual Tarantino's trademarks, much of its presence is low-key in comparison to his past works. Lacking the charisma, vibrance plus his patented blend of violence & humour yet offering a solid thriller that works far better when accepted as a separate entity from Tarantino's then-established forte, Jackie Brown isn't disappointing but it isn't as magical as his best works either.",,Anonymous,Crime
The stumble of a giant,"This film has the stamp of Tarantino everywhere, with excellent lighting effects, camera movements and vulgar and overflowing characters, but it's like a movie that the director has made in a hurry, without much care for details and with a rather weak and slow story, which needs a couple of reads to refine many contradictions, gaps and obviousness.Despite the good performances in general, it's quite far from other great successes like its predecessor.This proves that even the greatest have stumbles.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino not being Tarantino !!!!,"This undeniably has a look and feel that is different from all other Tarantino films. He avoids the flashiness and and his signature over the top bravura to present us with a very mature, low key film that expertly engages us and still has all the entertainment value that all his other films boast of. Although this is again a story that deals with crime and criminal activities, but there is surprisingly very little violence and blood shed throughout the film. The script is tight with very subtle scenes involving very provocative dialogues. Characters look much more believable and realistic than Tarantino's other films and the acting is top class. Pam Grier and Robert Forster deserve a special mention. The screenplay like Pulp Fiction is at times non linear and very intricate. All the different characters play significant roles leading up to a satisfying climax.I really was impressed by this film and I now know how mature and versatile Tarantino can be when he wants to. For me, this is Tarantino's 3rd best film after Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Jackson) The real treat of the film is that it's a slice of life look at people dealing with age and facing retirement. Ordell knows he can spend the rest of his life spending, Lewis can't smoke a bong properly anymore, Jackie Brown and Max Cherry are both stuck in jobs that will have them with things that ain't worth a damn Quentin Tarantino said he made this film for black audiences and everyone else is invited.

There is a shot of a womens feet (out of all shots of womens feet in his film, this is my favourite). There are references to things on television. There's a great soundtrack and so on and so forth I don't know if I'll ever see a film like it again in my life, but I prefer it to Quentins others because of it's adult themes and much more to Pulp Fiction because of the structure I give it 100/100",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Tarantino film for non-poseurs...,"Pitch perfect. So Tarantino actually made at least one film that doesn't allow viewers to get high on gore, and does require some concentration to get it. No wonder people didn't like it. Jackie Brown is like a Coen Bros. script directed by Tarantino. A bunch of people all scrambling for a bagful of cash - except unlike a Coen Bros. movie, these people aren't all morons, and someone manages to get away. The director executes it like a pro, never letting a viewer's attention wane.The dialog in this film is smart and sober. Samuel L. Jackson is the epitome of scum, and plus he's badass to the core. Pam Grier is an absolute FOX. These two were born to play their parts. The casting is uniformly perfect - except De Niro. I have no clue what he was doing here - seems like the studio wanted more ""star value"". He sleepwalks through the whole thing, dragging down the quality of the entire film.Overall this film is just a BIT slow. A couple of places require some speeding up, but on the whole the mood and pace is perfect. The character of Jackie Brown is one of the most interesting things Tarantino has come up with. He seems to have very quickly realized that his fans don't want anything even remotely resembling substance, and so he went commercial big-time with his next project. Kill Bill struck the mother lode. Its eerie; the man has a frightening grasp of the average movie-goer's likes and dislikes.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Amazingly boring.,"Is this really a Tarrantino film?   What happened?  .I have been watching this movie for 50 minutes now, and I am BORED OUT OF MY MIND.

C-Span is more exciting.-Mind you, I actually hate the typical macho action flick, wherein everything blows up all the time.  However, it would be nice to have SOMETHING happen in 50 minutes.  So far, all the characters have pretty much just sat around and talked, and in fairly monotone voices, yet.The cast is as all-star as you can get, but they have absolutely nothing to do, and they act like they haven't had their morning coffee yet.  -Or perhaps they all just came off a three-day bender.  Boring, boring, boring, boring.Words just about fail me.  I remember that most of the critics hated this movie when it came out.  Now I know why.

Oh dear Tarantino what have you done?,"First off let me say that I am a big QT fan. I have seen all his other films like Resevior Dogs, Unlucky Romance, Kill Bill 1 and 2, Pulp Fiction and Inglorious Basterds etc. Though I knew Jackie Brown was different that it wasn't as violent hence the 15 certificate and that there was more deeper characterisation and plot development, which isn't what QT does I was still intrigued and was looking forward to my weekly film lecture at uni as this was the film that was screening.It pains me to give this such a low rating. Yes there is some great dialogue with superb music and the acting is great with some moments of comic relief but it's far too long! I didn't necessarily expect action all the way through but there was barely anything. All there was just talking, rambling all the characters and going into to deep analysis about them when there didn't need to be.The plot was simple but Tarantinio just drags it out. I don't mind deeper character development but there has to be a balance. This dosen't have it. The usual sparkle and pace we have come to expect from Tarantino was gone from this film, but thankfully since with Inglorious Basterds, which I loved, he has reverted back to his original formula.It's a brave attempt by QT to make a different type of film and it can work but not in this case and by the end I came out just not caring about any of the characters and what happened to them and it's a pity with such a star cast of Robert De Niro, Samuel L Jackson and Brigit Fonda that they were wasted.But despite this setback for QT he's still a superb director whose allowed one little slip up.

Jackson doesn't have a character?,"I just want to disagree that Samuel L. Jackson in this movie doesn't really have a character. One of my favorite things about this movie is his character. It's an extremely subtle and well-done depiction of a manipulative sociopath. If you pay close attention you can actually see the way he's carefully watching the reactions of people he's talking to to make sure they're going in the direction he wants. The character himself is acting almost constantly throughout the movie, the few times you see him alone, as he really is, it's like he's a completely different person (a very frightening person). One of the hardest things to do in acting is to play a character who is himself acting, and it's to Jackson's credit that he pulls it off so well.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Elmore Leonard meets Blaxploitation,"Jackie Brown (1997/Quentin Tarantino) **** out of ****The openings of many Tarantino films are classic. They usually began with some great dialogue at a diner or bar, and set the tone for the film itself. But with `Jackie Brown', you get the exact opposite. What you get is pretty straight forward: The rolling of the credits accompanied by a song (and a small homage to The Graduate'). But, the normal credits do set the tone for the film. They clearly state that this will be Tarantino's most normal, serious, and realistic film.The plot is about a flight attendant (Pam Grier) who gets caught smuggling her boss's gun money into the United States. Instead of getting sent up river, she teams up with a FBI agent (Michael Keaton) and a local cop (Michael Bowen) to bust her employer (Samuel L. Jackson). But then she thinks up a plan that works toward her advantage. Along for the ride are Robert DeNiro (an ex con), Bridget Fonda (Jackson's hot and cold lover), Robert Forster (in an Academy Award Nominated performance as a burnt out bail bondsman), and Chris Tucker as a loud mouth lowlife.Just about everything in this film is great, if not everything. Tarantino has once again gives past actors another shot at fame (Grier and especially Forster). This is Tarantino's most realistic film, probably due to the fact that the story is based on the novel `Rum Punch' by Elmore Leonard, which he adapted into an interesting caper film and blaxploitation homage. The characters are not larger than life like they were in `Pulp Fiction' and in `Reservoir Dogs', they are real people, and that is why they are so likable. The pacing is also excellent. I have read some reviews saying that it is to slow, but the pacing reflects the mood of the two main characters. Grier is tired of her dead-end job, and tired of making $16,000 a year. Forster is tired for practically the same reasons as Grier. And their tiredness is the slow pacing that most of the film has.After watching one of the documentaries on the second disk of the DVD, I greatly respect Tarantino's casting decision of Robert Forster. He was saying that he could have easily cast someone like Gene Hackman in Forster's role, because Forster was a Z-list celebrity making films like `Vigilante' or `Maniac Cop 3'. Although he appeared in bad movies, his performances were still good. And Tarantino saw this in him, and gave him the opportunity to show the world that he was here, and that he hadn't lost his chops.When the name Tarantino' is brought up, usually `Pulp Fiction' or `Reservoir Dogs' comes to mind. But this should not be. `Jackie Brown' is not considered as one of Tarantino's better films, and this is sad, because it is just as good (if not better) than the first two films mentioned.

Excellent movie!,"This is one of top-notch Tarantino films, which takes you several hours of concentration to find a single flaw. Work of Tarantino as a director is great as usual, actors are excellent (especially Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson and Michael Keaton), script is brilliant, and the whole atmosphere is very realistic. Although there is almost no action, the movie captures viewer's attention from the first minute.

Jackie Brown is a Flight Attendant who finds herself needing more than her wits alone to outsmart Samuel Jackson & the Feds,"Pam Grier and Robert Forster are great as a flight attendant a bit past her prime and  graying bail bondsman who meet under, not the best of circumstances, but have no choice but to trust each other to survive the street tough gun runner played by Samuel L.Jackson and his cronie crooks. And still stay one step in front of the Feds. Can they do it?? Well pop in the video and hear Tarantino adapt another Elmore Leonard classic.

Tarantino does what Tarantino does best,"Quentin Tarantino's third feature isn't generally as highly rated among fans as his previous two. Many non-Tarantino fans say that Tarantino fans don't like this film because it's central character is a woman, but the simple fact of the matter is that it's simply not as good. Jackie Brown lacks the bite and dynamic genius that epitomised Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, and instead of having a profound influence on cinema, Jackie Brown is more of a continuation of what Tarantino started with his first two features. I am neither a fan nor a hater of Tarantino; up until the Kill Bill travesty, I was a fan; but now I'm not so sure. However, this was made in a time when Tarantino was still cool, and 'cool' is something this movie definitely is. The coolness comes from Tarantino's quick-fire script, relaxed character mannerisms and old style soundtrack. The coolness doesn't do the film any favours whatsoever on the realism, or credibility front, but when you're watching Jackie Brown, you know you're watching a movie; so just sit back, relax and have fun, as Tarantino takes you on a tour of what he loves about cinema.In technical terms, Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's finest hour. This is the most intelligent and mature script he ever wrote (the fact that it was based on someone else's work not withstanding). This is also the film that he reached his directorial peak. Tarantino is good at making cool crime films; he proved it with his first two features, and this film goes a long way to proving it more. Typically, it's a long way from perfect; it's overlong (an interesting prelude to Kill Bill, which was about 2 hours overlong), the character development is cringe-worthy at times and the story gets muddled a little towards the middle; but the good outweighs the bad, and when you've got the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Robert DeNiro chewing fat over a 'Chicks with Guns' video, you're unlikely to care about the film's problems. As usual, Tarantino razzle-dazzles his audience with his trademark 'great' cast (which really is great by the way) and a soundtrack comprised of songs that used to be hip (and now are again, strangely) and this helps to mask the film's problems also.All in all, Jackie Brown is a lot of fun. Audiences the world over should gather round and thank Tarantino for making this film. This is the sort of film that allows you to lose yourself for a couple of hours and just absorb what you see on screen. Quentin Tarantino may not be the greatest director of all time, but he knows how to entertain and this film is immense in that department. Here's to hoping Tarantino returns to projects he can handle in the near future...",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Excellent plot - perfect cast,"This film is superbly crafted with excellent twists in the plot and in depth character studies of several people.There is no such thing as ""blacksploitation"" it was the name given to films like the original Shaft which depicted a black male as being sexually desirable. The red necks couldn't stand that and had to rubbish Shaft and black males were recast back into comic roles (E.g. Will Smith.) Proof? I don't know of a single other film, which depicts a black male as an object of sexual desire.Jackie Brown is beautiful and smart but has been `round the block` a few times and is sick of starting her life over again every few years. She outsmarts the crooks and the cops and falls for the bail bond guy who assisted her.

One of the greatest crime films,"Reportedly, Elmore Leonard read the Tarantino-penned script of Jackie Brown and proclaimed it the best screenplay he'd ever read. This wasn't hyperbole - watching Jackie Brown is watching dialogue glide right off the page onto the screen in a fashion you don't often get to see. Jackie Brown is the ultimate writer's film, an action film where the dialogue is the action.Tarantino balances the film's narrative complexity with genuine emotional involvement and (shock) a believable love story and the result is so brilliant it seems almost effortless. Perhaps this is why people consistently rate Jackie Brown below many of his other films. It all looks a little too easy, a little too cool.Well, it's my feeling that this film represented the peak of Tarantino's monopoly on 'cool' in films, and that his output post Brown has been a constant battle to maintain that status or to win it back. Tarantino has said he would never adapt another film. I think that's too bad, as this film represents what I believe is the greatest film to Tarantino's credit. Jackie Brown is fantastic cinema told with balls to the wall confidence.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

I think that you should definitely see this flick if your a Robert De Niro fan. Although I was surprised that he was in it, his character is one of the most key elements to what happens in the end.

Best Movie Ever Made,"Jackie Brown directed by Quentin Tarantino has intrigued and inspired me from the first time I saw it. I have probably seen the movie twenty times or more.One of the characteristics of the movie is that it is both realistic and unrealistic. It is hard to believe that the story of Jackie Brown is real because the chain of events is too unlikely. In addition, there are too many coincidences. The chance of types of characters portrayed in the movie coming together is unlikely. For example, Ordell Robbie is a criminal who will do anything to save himself and protect his money, including murder. Melanie is a druggie who has no apparent way of supporting herself other than living off of Ordell. However, she seems way too intelligent and too attractive to have to resort to that.Jackie Brown could be a true story because of the sense of realism. The individual actions are not too incredible. The characters have flaws that make them seem human and they are not stereotypes. The dialog of the characters in Jackie Brown are down-to-earth.Jackie Brown is an amusing and entertaining movie. Jackie Brown has a lot of violent action, but it is not too graphic. In addition, it is enjoyable because it is unpredictable. The movie does not follow strict chronological order. Additionally the movie is entertaining because of the different points of view of the same scenes.The reason why Jackie Brown has intrigued me is that the movie allows you to put yourself in a character's place and makes you think about how you would react to extreme situations. Even though the police have never arrested me, seeing Jackie get arrested gives me a sense of how it would feel to be in prison. Before Max Cherry met Jackie, he was lonely and had nothing to do but work. He had a stressful job dealing with criminals. He trusted a criminal, but she was doing what she had to do to survive so she was not really a criminal and he saw that, so he wanted to help her. He was a good and decent man.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nice Gem but Miscast,"We'll written, potted and acted. Pam Greer makes the flick; something about her personality that wreaks confidence-I dig that. That said, two roles are miscast: DeNero and Fonda. DeNero is a simple actor; no depth. He acts the same in all his roles; he's a misfit. He just doesn't gel in this flick. Fonda's not convincing, just doesn't fit; can't put my finger on it. I'd give this movie a 10 were It not miscast with those two. Anyhoo, I used to loath Jackson, until I started watching some of his more unpopular roles and was totally impressed. This man is nothing short of great, as actors go. I'm glad I came around. If you can ignore the two f-ups in DeNero & Fonda who give the flick a weird vibe, this is a must watch. Did I mention Greer is gorgeous?",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Tarantino's best, but not necessarily for Pulp or Dogs fans","This movie was the best Hollywood flic I've seen in a long while.The film marks Pam Grier's triumphant return to centre stage after years of neglect following the end of her early career in Blacksploitation pics. Still looking knock-out gorgeous in middle-age, Grier proves to all naysayers once and for all with this film that she definitely can act. Clearly Tarantino's tribute to one of his favourite actresses, the film's soundtrack (another excellent Tarantino soundtrack, this time with an appropriate focus on 70s funk and soul) even features one song sung by Grier, and another by Bobby Womack, the singer Grier first began her showbiz career as a back-up singer for.As equally brilliant as the the casting of Grier in the main role is the casting of Robert Forster as Jackie Brown's bail bondsman. The on-screen chemistry between Grier and Forster works perfectly, and the two's final scene together is the moving pinnacle of the entire inspired film.But those Tarantino fans looking for the graphic violence of Reservoir Dogs or the snide cynicism of Pulp Fiction will be disappointed with this film, which is a much deeper, quieter and more mature work. A good crime tale told with a nice plot twist, but more than this a deeper probing into the issues of aging, life and intimacy, this work satisfies in ways that Tarantino's previous works could not.With this film, Tarantino has made me into a fellow Pam Grier fan, and has left me waiting to see more from both of them.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 4 - Through his eyes, but not by his hand: Jackie Brown","Different, but the sameJackie Brown was the first (and until now the only) film that was directed by Quentin Tarantino, but written by someone else. The film was based on a novel by Elmore Leonard called Rum Punch. Now despite the fact that Tarantino did not write th e story of the film itself, his hand is very visible in the dialog. There are lines and conversations in this film that I consider to be typical of Quentin Tarantino (the same phenomenon can be found in From Dusk till Dawn). These conversations are mostly about nothing or do not really matter as far as the plot goes, but still they are interesting and entertaining to see,because they are gripping and sometimes even funny in their simplicity. I truly believe that the reason for Tarantino's brilliance partly stems from the fact, that he does not hide the amount of ridiculous conversations a human being has on a day. He shows us just how often we do that and he sometimes even exaggerates it. I must say though, that in this film, he stays on the normal side of conversations and despite the fact that there are some Tarantino tendencies to be found in the conversations, the man himself does not go quite as far as in his preceding two directorial offerings.Now Jackie Brown has what you might call an ensemble cast, with Robert DeNiro, Samuel L.Jackson, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda and Pam Grier, but that does not suffice to make a film good of entertaining. In my opinion Heat would be a pretty good example. That film had lots of names attached to it, but did not get much further than mediocrity. This film is different though. The actors have all been perfectly matched to the characters they are supposed to play. There was no actor or actress here that made an Academy Award winning performance, but every actor (including Chris Tucker) got his part down good. I was really impressed, especially by Pam Grier. Now I don't really now any of her other work, but judging from the sort of films she made, I would not assume that she could play that well. I guess it just all depends on the part you get and the director you work with.This film has a running time of 150 minutes, which I would say is pretty much for an ordinary Gangster film without too much action, but throughout the entire experience there never ever is one part that is too long. Everything done in this film is done with some thought and every scene is made perfect by the chemistry of the subtle camera movement, the actors and the music. Now I'm not the sort of folk you would catch listening to any of the music played in this film, but I felt that they underscored the events taking place on screen to maximum effect. Tarantino has really emphasized that he is the master when it comes to combining picture and songs to enhance the impact of the film. The music is not there to sell the soundtrack, as is the case with films like Daredevil or The Blair Witch Project 2, it is there to make you feel the movie. Tarantino does not want you to watch his film. He wants you to experience it. Jackie Brown may not be as thrilling as Reservoir Dogs and it may not be as cool and mysterious as Pulp Fiction, but it still is an enjoyable experience. There are many directors out there who would love to have a film this good on their resume (not to mention the cast) and still Jackie Brown is not as good as Tarantino's preceding directorial offerings.7,5 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A More Silent Version of QT,"Even when you think Tarantino is at his weakest, the final product is always top stuff. And I don't think you could ever call a Tarantino film weak. Similarly to Reservoir Dogs, the film emphasises the human aspect in the corruption and difficult choices of gangster life, condemning it without condemning it, just representing what is true and daily, having respect for the characters and their role in reality. That's why Jackie decides to flee with the money.And the humanity of it gets accentuated with the unusual romance between Jackie and Max, in an ending sequence beautifully and poetically portrayed in close-ups. I very much enjoyed a more silent version of QT. This guy can't make bad films.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

But I recently got an HBO free-sample week and JACKIE BROWN happened to be on, so I finally watched the whole movie, and that original awkwardness vibe was more than fulfilled.

"""I'm serious as a heart attack...""","Jackie Brown is Quentin Tarantino's best film. There is not a single note wrong here from beginning to end. Dogs was a rough start, Pulp was a crowd pleaser, but with Jackie Brown, there are characters who are more than pawns in a game of ""Guess what movie I ripped off...""The awesome cast is firing on all cylinders to give the movie a real backbone. Surprisingly only Robert De Niro's presence comes off out of place in his nearly wordless role.The film works better on more levels than any other Tarantino. Why? Three main reasons;He is working from a completely realized story from Elmore Leonard. Tarantino has never shown himself to be much with a singular story over 2 hours, Leonard's Rum Punch gave him a solid foundation to work from.He is free of gimmicks dealing in black and white suits, glossy guns or samurai swords. There are almost no way to quantify his filmic references here, but they are all completely in sync with the story and characterizations, not for flamboyance. The story and characters rule here. What little violence there is in Jackie Brown, it actually has power and doesn't feel gleeful like in Pulp or Kill Bill.Most importantly...He is hopelessly in love with almost every character in this film and it feels as if he KNOWS each of these people. The personal touches for each of the players here are well done by the actors, but Tarantino simply worships them with his words, his camera and his soundtrack. This film could easily be called ""Reverence.""More than 10 years on, Jackie Brown feels fresher and far more mature than a re-watch of his other films, which by comparison come off as wind up toys or forced. On the other hand, Jackie Brown is a true love song to Pam Grier, the 70s and Blaxploitation and movies in general.But above all that, Jackie Brown is solid and just a damn good movie on any level.

I like Reservoir Dogs and I really love Pulp Fiction, so I had hopeful expectations prior to viewing this film. Sadly, I was very disappointed by what I saw.Robert De Niro was a wasted talent who had no purpose to the story, the movie doesn't know what it wants to be, and Samuel L. Jackson doesn't make a convincing hustler. Does that mean I hate everything about this movie? Not necessarily. I like the direction, the dialog is smooth, and the production value is good, but I wanted more and the movie just didn't deliver. For example, there's a scene where the female lead is getting a bag full of money in a dressing room. It shows you this exact same scene from three different perspectives which was annoying and didn't move the plot forward. Tarantino did this method so well in Pulp Fiction, but that movie worked because of its non-linear structure. Here, its like Tarantino ran out of ideas on the way there and didn't know how to translate his vision.Overall, this movie was a disappointment.

Extremely exciting and well told crime film,"Brilliant performances and a killer soundtrack! Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is a flight attendant who is caught smuggling money for arms dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L Jackson). She is given an ultimatum by the police to help bring Ordell in or become incarcerated herself. All the while, Ordell seems to have some tricks up his sleeve (keeping Jackie and the audience well on the edge of their seat) while a fresh plan is hatched for another smuggling. It's the only film Quentin has brought to the screen based off a separate original source, based on the book 'Rum Punch' by Elmore Leonard, and as far as I'm aware it's a very faithful adaptation produced beautifully for the big screen, keeping Tarantino's glorious style well in tact. It cemented Jackson as the ultimate actor to deliver the distinctive dialogue. The entire cast are amazing and despite its impressive 2 hours and 30 minutes length, I could've happily sat and watched these characters for longer. Pam Grier creates a career defining role and she shines so brightly here; a great screen presence.

A great Tarantino,"Jackie Brown is my favourite Tarantino film. Grier is absolutely brilliant in the lead role, showing that a middle aged black woman is able to pack one hell of a punch. She is sexy, manipulative and gives as good as she gets while maintaining her charisma throughout.The movie is not as violent or ""arty"" as Pulp Fiction, but I feel that in some ways this allows a wider audience to appreciate what Tarantino has to offer. (Luckily, Tarantino does not make one of his frequent awkward cameos in this film). Lisa Gay Hamilton (aka Rebecca on TVs ""The Practice"") makes a cameo as a young misled country girl.The plot is simple on the surface - but there are depths and unexpected twists all the way. Samuel L Jackson is always great value as a gun runner, truly cold hearted and yet likeable.This film was perhaps not marketed as well as it should have been, and is worth a look for those wanting a suspenseful thriller where characterisation is more important than explosions and special effects.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Boring,"I'm not the one to get bored easily and give up on a movie. However, this one pushed my limits. The intro was over 1 hour and the main part wasn't worth my time either.On paper, great cast but extremely boring and way too long for such a basic plot. Sorry to say that. I know the names sound great but the product is mediocre. It's overrated just because of the names.Perhaps Tarantino is not good at making movies based on others' stories since this was the only one where he used an existing story. If you want to watch it just because you want to make sure you don't miss anything (like I did) be prepared to get bored, keep your mobile or a book next to you.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great follow-up to a masterpiece,"Jackie Brown is a middle-aged airline stewardess who supplements her income by smuggling arms for crime kingpin Ordell Robbie. One day she is caught and the agents offer her a deal in order to apprehend Robbie. Robbie, however, is onto the threat and tries to have Brown eliminated. What follows is a dangerous game of bluff, deceit and betrayal.In 1994, Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed the greatest film ever made, Pulp Fiction. Following up that movie was always going to be a tall order, especially as his previous movie, Reservoir Dogs, was almost as good. There was almost no way his third movie could even come close to those two masterpieces.However, Tarantino gives it a good try.Yes, Jackie Brown is not in the same league as Pulp Fiction, or Reservoir Dogs, but very little is. It is, however, still a great movie. Clever, solid, plot, based on Elmore Leonard's novel 'Rum Punch'. Has the Tarantino trademark complexity and interconnectivity of a few stories and characters and meticulous plot detail, all combined with very witty dialogue and dry dark humour.Excellent performances, with Pam Grier (as Jackie Brown) and Robert Forster to the fore.On the negative side, the plot does feel overly drawn out. The meticulousness slows down the pace of the movie. Also feels overly complex at times, as if some of the twists are there for twist's sake.Still a great movie though.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A different side of Tarantino,"This was the second movie by Tarantino that I ever saw, the first being 'Reservoir Dogs'.  After having been amazed by every second of 'Reservoir Dogs' (pop culture references, great dilaogue, cool minimalistic action, unconventional character development), 'Jackie Brown' seemed very bland, and dragged on way too long.  I was younger then and hungry for brain candy rather than any real themes, especially about getting old and not having anything to show for it.  So I labeled this proof that Tarantino could make a mediocre film. Now, after a second viewing, a few years and many lessons and heartbreaks and shattered dreams and heavy depressions later, this film really spoke to me.  This is a much more subtle film than any of the others Tarantino has been involved in.  The characters don't babble on about meaningless topics to no avail, but rather they speak about their desires and ambitions, and often not very in depth.  There is a lot about these characters that we have to figure out by reading the little there is on the surface, but they seem less contrived.  In Reservoir Dogs, each character is built up to be a certain type so that they can play a certain role in the crumbling of the jewel heist.  Here in 'Jackie Brown' we often haven't pinned down what a character is like until after they've acted.  The relationship between DeNiro and Fonda's characters is especially interesting because they do a complete turnaround in their attitudes towards eachother, even though DeNiro's performance wasn't one of his better outtings.  Grier and Forster manage a mostly platonic interracial relationship that we do not see very often, even in modern cinema.  Tarantino shows signs of maturing visually here as well, especially the shot he uses for the demise of Beaumont, but I don't want to reveal anything for those who've not seen it.  Anyway, 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Black Sheep of the Tarantino Herd,"Small-time gangster Ordell (Jackson) runs guns. He also has the nasty habit of using a legit bail bondsman (Forster) to haul any captured associates out of prison and kill them before they can talk. When hostess Jackie Brown (Grier) is arrested for smuggling Ordell's money into the US, she persuades Ordell to let use her to con the feds and smuggle his entire fortune under their noses, while deceiving the police into thinking she is helping them nail Ordell. But whose side is Jackie Brown really on?After his crowning success Pulp Fiction, Tarantino tones down the stylistic fireworks and adapts an Elmore Leonard novel. The slick double-crossing and elegant narrative is pure Leonard, but the dialogue and humor remain vintage Tarantino, and the union works wonders. After an opening shot that bodes ill by shamelessly copying ""The Graduate"", and hints that this might be a mere blaxploitation revival, Tarantino plays things more subtly with a laid-back and elegant direction, comprised mostly of long takes and a fluid camera - courtesy of longtime Del Toro collaborator Guillermo Navarro - allowing us to focus on the actors and their ace performances. Robert Forster received most of the praise at the time of release for underacting to a tee, while Samuel L. Jackson's larger than life Ordell and Robert De Niro's half-wit convict Louis steal the showier moments. In truth, this is a group effort, and everybody delivers, from Pam Grier to Michael Keaton (in a role he reprized a year later in ""Out of Sight"", also adapted from a Leonard novel).Jackie Brown was not fully appreciated when it first came out, and Tarantino sadly seems to have disavowed it to some extent, following it with the indulgent and pointless Kill Bill duo, before finding himself again with the more playful Deathproof. This might be less showy and hard-hitting than Reservoir Dogs, but it remains his most sensitive and mature film to date. One can only hope he will explore such territory again soon.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Quick, sharp, and well thought-out.","Of all the Tarantino fans I've encountered, none have praised Jackie Brown as highly as I do.  ""It's alright"" is the common answer.In my opinion, it's one of the most underrated movies of all time.  Just because it wasn't ultra-violent and didn't have the snappy dialogue of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction doesn't make it bad.The characters are smart, like-able, and the type of people you normally wouldn't hang out with.  Robert DeNiro put on one of the best performances of his career as the quiet but visually bored Louis Gara who is like the friend that would always rather be somewhere else.  Cool and collected, you wonder how long it takes for him to snap.Sam Jackson is Ordell Robbie, the gun runner who thinks he's cooler than he actually is.  Sure, he has the money, the guns, the girls, but it's all just to stroke his own ego as he's not much more than a bumbling cool guy-wannabe.Then there's Max Cherry, the bail-bondsman who has seen and done it all, and now just wants to sit back and enjoy life, but can never let himself do so.Jackie Brown is a little bit of everyone.  She's been there, done that, and she puts up with stuff she doesn't want to just to get by.  One of Pam Grier's best performances.Character study aside, it's a very well thought out crime caper that comes together very well.Great direction, good pacing, fantastic characters, and a slick plot, Jackie Brown is not to be overlooked.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino's second-best film,"Let's not get carried away - Pulp Fiction, this is not. But to anybody who knows his work, this movie screams Tarantino from beginning to end. It is clever, intriguing, observational, entertaining, but never patronizing.Personally I think DeNiro & the stunningly gorgeous Fonda are hopelessly mis-cast here. As in PF and almost every other movie he appears in, Jackson controls every one of his numerous scenes. That's fine because he does it better than anyone else I know. But it needs a very special actor to play opposite him, and the above mentioned don't quite fit the bill here. Forster & Grier on the other hand, manage it well (for those not yet fans of Forster, check out American Perfekt.) Keaton provides good support but Chris Tucker is under-used. Locations are not really memorable and the film lacks atmosphere. What really makes this worthy is the script, the plot, and the lead's acting. Of course there's the music too, but it's all strangely subdued.Obviously the pedigree is evident and the film is well-crafted, but it is the story that shines through here. I give it 8 only because I think QT has done better, but it really is a must-see movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
kill bills and pulp fiction step aside -- Jackie Brown is in town!,"Jackie Brown -- the character and the movie -- RULES.I'd seen several of the Tarantino movies and liked almost all of them and love at least a few. For some reason I'd never seen JB. Discussing the merits and demerits of Kill Bill (I say 2 yeahs and guy at work sez 1 sucks and 2 is better) and the guy asks me if I've seen it. I say no. He sez I should. It's taken me 2-3 years to do it, but DAYUM, I'm glad I did.Jackie the character has it all: looks, brains, charm, sass, and a survival instinct that makes all women want to stand up and say yes! Pam Grier has been SERIOUSLY UNDERUTILIZED in the acting world. WHY? Tarantino does an extraordinary job of directing JB. I'd like to give the man a great big kiss for the way he has portrayed Jackie. No slack for her. No apologies. No exaggerations. She is what most women are or could be if only men would just leave us alone. But men don't leave us alone. They own everything and control everything -- except the pussy -- so we are forced to deal with them. I applaud Tarantino for having the balls to acknowledge what's beautiful about women.The cast of JB is extraordinarily kickass. It's a nice change to see DeNiro play something other than a leading role! Don't get me wrong though, he's awesome in what he does. Samuel L Jackson blows me away in this movie. It's hard to describe how he captures the essence of the character he portrays, but he has subtantial acting skills. Jackson's little blond surfer girl -- Bridgette Fonda -- is perfect for her role. Michael Keaton has only a bit part and seems like a weak link in an otherwise titanic strength chain. Maybe it was him or maybe it was his slimy character though...The real star of this movie, however, has to be Robert Forster, who plays a bail bondsman who gets drawn into the plot of the movie. What the hell? I never would have thought he was capable of doing what he does in this movie. Kudos to Mr. Forster and to Mr. Tarantino for his abililty to see what Forster can do and giving him a chance to do it.Is there anything left to say? I don't know. Oh yeah ..................

"Black Sheep of the Tarantino Family, Jackie's More Substance-Minded Than Style-Blinded","Easily Quentin Tarantino's most mature work, which admittedly isn't saying much for a director who brought us the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique and a literal blast of adrenaline to the heart. That's not to say his films have ever lacked in substance - rather, I think the true depth of their character is merely overshadowed by those visceral moments of graphic excess and their stylish methods of delivery. Jackie Brown, instead, manages to step out from that bloody shadow and shine on its own volition. Its lingering close-ups and long doses of heady silence give the impression that the plot is moving slowly, when in fact it's going roughly a mile a minute. Tarantino just wants us to savor the performances of his all-star cast and the tangle of plot threads that surrounds them before forcing our heads out the window and punching the gas in the last twenty minutes. Along the way, he subtly, efficiently grazes a gamut of emotions that leaves us deeply invested in the (often untimely) fate of each character. Rich, complex and rewarding, it's not as flashy as Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, but it's every bit as excellent.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Best of Tarantino? Nah! Super fun? Damm straight!,"It's the best of Tarantino? No it is not! It's extremely fun? A LOT! Jackie Brown is the 3rd feature film from the master Quentin Tarantino, and can once again prove their writing skills and originality, and an unforgettable cast. The story looks a bit like Pulp Fiction, Jackie (Pam Grier) is a black stewardess 40 years, with life unstable financial environment, at least in this work. Because secretly she's a drug dealer and exchange money, she works for the ""famous"" arm's dealer Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), the most dangerous and ruthless leader of the crime (and extremely entertaining) anyone can know. On a normal day of traffic, Jackie is caught by two DEA agents Ray (Michael Keaton) and Mark (Michael Bowen), before being arrested both agents offer Jackie the chance to have all his clean criminal record in helping arrest Ordell . Between being perpetually stuck or open your mouth and be killed by Ordell, Jackie sees only a chance to enjoy this little game of intrigue. The entire movie, like any Tarantino movie, is filled with intriguing dialogs, what is most striking is that the film manages to be extremely fun just getting the dialog, and the plot twists than any movie Tarantino has. But this was the first film I see that Tarantino takes mild violence. It is violent? It is, but is not that awesome bloodbath of the other Tarantino's films. The cast is also formidable, Samuel L. Jackson BADASS as always; Pam Grier excellent as Robert Forster; Robert De Niro does not give his best performance, but he still shine as the temperamental junkie Louis Gara. Not the best of Tarantino, but it is really entertaining from start to finish, keeping the good spirit of the films of the great Master.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
loved it,"I have to admit that I had never seen a Quentin Tarantino film until recently. I saw him on Howard Stern and thought he was kind of fascinating so when Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction came on cable a few years ago, I watched them. Then I saw Kill Bill volume 1. The last one that I saw was Jackie Brown and liked it better than the others. The fact that so many great actors were in it, combined with me being in my mid 50's and remembering the movie the Sting so well may have had something to do with it. I have probably seen it four or 5 times on TV and is one of the few movies that I purchased the DVD. I am just a regular working guy and definitely not a critic but have recommended this to several people and all have loved it. All the actors do superb jobs. I think 30 years from now that people will still be watching it and finding it as enjoyable as they do now. One thing that I noticed that nobody put in the goofs was the age that Max was supposed to be. He said that he was 56 but when he showed Jackie his id, I believe that he was born in 1948, possibly a year or two earlier.

"""Is it this aisle Louis? Louisssss?""","Some say ""Jackie Brown"" is Tarantino's best work. I would say it at least equals the other masterpiece ""Pulp Fiction"". If you love his other work, then you must give this gem a chance, although everything is done very differently then in his other work, yet the Tarantino magic is still very recognizable and highly enjoyable. Higly enjoyable! I would say that ""Jackie Brown"" is his most playful work, yet simultaneously it is also his most serious work. It just oozes creativity and fun in his typical Tarantino direction style, but the story and the characters are still being portrayed very seriously, unlike many other Tarantino works in which characters often become almost cartoon like.This story is told entirely chronologically, with only one flashback. It is based on a story by Elmore Leonard, who has written numerous great stories, that have been turned into movie scripts. Quentin Tarantino got to know of this famous author by reading pulp magazines in the seventies, which were the inspiration for the title of his most popular movie ""Pulp Fiction"". But ""Jackie Brown"" is totally different in style and storyline, so be warned, because some first time viewers are a bit disappointed watching ""Jackie Brown"" because they expected more action. It is still very funny, but it is a talking heads movie, lots and lots of talk. Some serious talk, some con talk and some hilarious talk!""Jackie Brown"" is a slowburning portrait of a woman in financial dire straits, who smuggles some money across the border for a weapons dealer (Samuel L Jackson). She gets caught and then the story unfolds in ways you couldnt imagine, because Jackie Brown has gotta save her own ass and does she know how to do that! Female empowerment Booyah! Gotta see it for yourself. Suspenseful, hilarious and touching.The huge amount of time that is taken to learn to know the leading character Jackie Brown pleases me enormously. But some Tarantino gore fans migth find it lacking in speed. I love the slowburning flow of this story, I truly think the slowness is essential to the core of this subtle portrait. Almost 2 and a half hours is the running time and I guess 75% is pure talk with close ups of Jackie Brown and the other characters.Shot in 4:3 format, the old television format of the seventies and eighties and this particular choice of the director further prenounciates these magnificent close ups of the characters. It's a talking heads movie, in which every eyelash, wrinkle and nervous twitch in ones facial expression can be observed. That makes for some stunning pictures of the actors in it.""Jackie Brown"" is an Actor's Gem! Best dork role of Robert de Niro ever. Most freakiest role of Samuel L Jackson ever. And Pam Grier is by far the star of this brilliant Tarantino flick. What a joy to watch over and over again. I just can't get enough of it!Please check out the Trivia section of this film, because it is full of fun anecdotes. Interviews and quotes by Tarantino himself are often as interesting as his movies. Just a quote that I couldnt withold from you Imdb viewers: Quentin Tarantino compares the film Jackie Brown to Rio Bravo (1959). ""It's a hangout movie"", he explained. ""Jackie Brown is better the second time, and I think it's even better the third, and the fourth time. To me, that's the thing that Rio Bravo (1959) did. I remember the first time I saw Rio Bravo (1959), but I remember more the fifteenth time I saw Rio Bravo (1959). It's about hanging out with the characters.""This was my 200th review for Imdb.

Another Tarantino masterpiece,"Jackie Brown is one of those films that leaves you satisfied after a showing. Tarantino did very well, rather than what a lot of others have to say. Those who complain about the film's length should stick to a lesser story, something that isn't as layered as this Elmore Leonard adaptation.The acting in this film is superb. Whoever casted the film deserves a mention as well as Tarantino. From Samuel L. Jackson to Robert DeNiro to Chris Tucker in a more subdued role, all are in perfect character throughout. However, if there is anyone who steals the show it is Pam Grier. Grier delivers a powerhouse performance and just like Travolta in Pulp Fiction, I hope this manages to resurrect her film career. The camerawork on Grier at the beginning of the film as she walks through the airport and later while she is walking through the mall is a perfect example of how one can have an effect on a film without dialogue.This film ranks up there with Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs and still manages to do so without the use of gratuitous violence. The story is also presented in flashback sequences like Pulp Fiction, but again in a lesser form. Tarantino is a master with using differemt film techniques and angles and even threw in a split screen to sharpen the 70's effect. Another shot of Grier that speaks volumes in right after she has made the money switch. Frantic looking, she makes her way through the mall and seems lost and confused. As she turns around looking for someone, Tarantino circles her with the camera creating a state of confusion, then instantly stops this as she calls out a name. Moments like this are what make Tarantino one of the best directors of all time.Tarantino is using another Leonard story as the basis of his next film and if it follows suit in the ""Jackie Brown"" genre, it will surely be another success.A full recommendation for this film.8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Tarantino proves he's for real.  Deal with it.,"I read a positive review of this film which said it was the Elmore Leonard adaptation people were waiting for, but he wasn't sure if this was the Tarantino film people were waiting for.  Well, sure, if you were expecting PULP FICTION pt 2!  Given the way we Americans (although I live in Canada, I'm a U.S. citizen landed here) love to backlash, I know it's really popular to say Quentin Tarantino is a hack, and I believe the account given in the book KILLER INSTINCT which suggests he let success go to his head.  Still, there's no doubt the man has talent, and he shows it here.I do agree with those who feel it's too long, De Niro is wasted, and Samuel L. Jackson does go overboard on the n-word.  But it's funny and compelling to watch after the plot kicks in, with the same attention to character Leonard has.  I'm not as familiar with the work of Pam Grier and Robert Forster that Tarantino and those of similar tastes are, but I was blown away by their work here.  And who'd have thought a filmmaker as supposedly trapped in hipsville as Tarantino would present straight a romance between two middle-aged people, let alone an interracial one?  That alone makes it worth watching.  I also loved Bridget Fonda in the role of Melanie, an airhead.  Fonda does that type of role well, because she has no condescension in her.  I'm sure this film will get better with time, once the ""Tarantino is nothing"" campaign loses steam.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tarentino proves to be as great a storyteller as he is a film stylist...,"Though PULP FICTION is definitely Quentin Tarantino's stylish masterpiece full of cinematic flair and magicianship, Tarantino also proved to be a master storyteller with his severely underrated follow-up JACKIE BROWN, a richly entertaining story of LA criminals and low-lifes that may not contain the cinematic trickery of FICTION, but is a textbook example of telling a great story on film. And it's not so much the story itself, but the way it unfolds with its introduction of characters which are alternately detailed and murky, but done in a style that keeps you glued to the screen and greedily anticipating what's going to happen. Tarantino's story centers around the title character, a 44-year old flight attendant (Pam Grier) whose double life and shady past are the linchpin of an elaborate story of her struggle to get out from under the thumb of a sleazy weapons dealer (flawlessly portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson). Once again, Tarantino tells his story from the far reaching points of an octagon, where each point of the octagon appears to have no connection to the next but it all manages to flow into one smoothly executed climax displayed from several points of view. Tarantino's deft screenplay rivals his Oscar-winning PULP FICTION screenplay and his direction is as stylish as ever. As always, Tarantino's penchant for stunt casting pays off, especially with the casting of 70's action heroine Grier (who still looks fantastic) in the title role. Grier is smart, sexy, and completely commands the screen without ever going over the top. Tarantino also revived the near comatose career of Robert Forster by casting him as Max Cherry, the cool-headed bails bondsman who befriends Jackie. Forster's smooth and controlled performance actually earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor, though the whole cast works at Oscar level. Also providing solid support are Michael Keaton (one of his best performances), Michael Bowen, Bridget Fonda, Chris Tucker, and especially Robert De Nio, having a ball playing Jackson's old buddy who re-enters his life. And it's all backed up by some of the most amazing Motown music from the 1960's that will evoke memories by itself. Tarantino and company hit a bullseye here.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Woman Named Jackie Brown ...,"Quentin Tarantino created such recognizable trademarks in his first two movies that the third one, ""Jackie Brown"" seems like borrowing the name, but not the essence. No over-the-top violence, no wisecracking dialogues, no non-linear editing except for a few parts: ""Jackie Brown"" is not the most defining film of Tarantino's style, but certainly of his incredibly versatile talent.The film patiently lets the relationships grow and the decisions be made with a level of realism that respects the audience's intelligence. Interactions, deep moments of thinking, while a usual thriller would mostly rely on action, massive shootouts or bloody violence; in ""Jackie Brown"", the point is elsewhere, and the plot only works to assess the depth and three-dimensionality of the characters, stuck in a cat-and-mouse situation with the complexity of a chess game. And with so many lives at stake, the smartest will be the winner. There's such a harrowing feeling relying on Jackie Brown's desperate need to be THE smartest, it's only fitting that she is an attendant: her situation embodies the stressful nature of her job, when regularly, she expresses the need to light a cigarette so she can pull herself together, have a break. And think again.What makes ""Jackie Brown"" so compelling is that the best scenes generally feature two characters trying to act clever, to make a decision, a move, to see through things. Nothing is taken for granted, not even one earlier scene when Ordell (Samuel L. Jackson) gets rid of Beaumont Livinston, a business partner who's got busted by the AFT agent Ray Nicolet (Michael Keaton) and might rat on him, Beaumont (Chris Tucker) is hard to convince, refusing to get in the trunk, he finally falls in the trap when Ordell tempts him by promising his favorite food after the job is done. This scene is well-written and it serves the plot on two crucial levels: first, it highlights Ordell's personality as an excellent manipulator, secondly, it illustrates in what kind of situation, Jackie Brown is put, when she's the next one arrested by Nicolet.The film is long because it works on a repetitive process, vital to create a feeling of logical continuity when the whole plot is based on pure logic. The first repetition involves the third most important character of the film, the bail bondsman, Max Cherry, played by Robert Forster in a nuanced but powerful performance, rightfully Oscar-nominated for Best Supporting Actor. Max paid the bond for Beaumont before he got killed, and of course, he's the one in charge of Jackie Brown's case. By using the same logic, Tarantino deliberately lures us into a feeling of predictability to better surprise us with the scenes' outcomes. Yes, we expect Max to fall in love with Jackie, but the way it's handled is original and satisfying: no sex scene, no stereotypical dialogues, there's a relation evolving smoothly, graciously, with lines that ring true.And 'true' is the first feeling that inspires the growing tacit romance between Max and Jackie. Hard to believe that it's made by the same director who made ""Pulp Fiction"", with an emphasis on ""Fiction"", but it's the ultimate proof of Tarantino's originality and versatility as both a writer and a director. Look at just how the characterization works. In most movies, characters are defined by their actions, in ""Jackie Brown"", their thinking, their decisions, their collaboration, and their interactions define them through an extreme intricate puzzle with all the pieces reassembled together at the end. The movie can be frustrating at some parts where we don't follow Jackie Brown's reasoning but this is pivotal as she's trying to outsmart Ordell, Nicolet and Max a little bit, that we might feel outsmarted too.The film works on that intellectual and subtly emotional level, that makes all the difference between ""Jackie Brown"" and the other 90's gangster films. And Tarantino didn't forget his particular touch, we get the iconic trunk shot, the beautiful sight of Bridget Fonda's lovely feet (sorry), an unrecognizable De Niro in a loser role, and a homage to the opening of one of my all-time favorite movies ""The Graduate"". Tarantino's touch is present but never without serving the story. Take Bridget Fonda as Melanie, she is an obnoxious and particularly annoying spoiled bitchy blonde and De Niro as Louis Gara isn't the brightest of the bunch, the combination of the two makes you expect the worst. They're criminals, they know how to shoot, but Jackie Brown is smart, and Max Cherry has a fondness on her, their 'partnership' as she likes to say, is more valuable than all the guns in the world, to outsmart a criminal mastermind like Ordell.And Pam Grier as Jackie Brown, is the reason-to-be of the film, another demonstration of Tarantino's secret talent not to revive careers but to remind us how underused some actresses are... or some actors like Robert Forster. ""Jackie Brown"" wouldn't have worked the same with actors and actresses used to play lead romantic roles. Grier and Forster are so into their character of old, tired, hard-working people that they don't expect to fall in love, so the communication goes through objects, music and other intermediary elements. When Max listens to this beautiful 'Delfonics' song, we know it's his heart for Jackie that is pounding and we feel for them whenever the melody can be heard. Age is one of the recurring themes of the film, incarnating this passing of time as an invitation to act before it's too late, a tormenting feel of urgency. Because there's always more than money, more than freedom. Jackie Brown is not totally relieved at the end as she knows she's won more than a 'partner' in Max.And we're satisfied that, at least, they could finally exchange a tender, intense and rewarding kiss before another song could get between them, leaving the ellipsis or the interrogation mark up to the viewer.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great movie, mistreated by production companies","Jackie Brown is yet another Tarantino film that ages very well. It is a break from the speed of Pulp and the plot has this fine Roald Dahl quality: the spectator is not let in on Jackies plan until the very end of the movie.I keep on playing the 4:3 DVD I have - the film seems to get better every time. I was happy to be able to buy a 1.85:1 copy, distributed by Buena Vista (UK). But what did these bastards do? They clipped the top and bottom part of the 4:3 transfer I already have. Instead of seeing the whole frame, I get to see LESS (than in the 4:3 transfer). And it is quite visible too, because actors now have the top-part of their heads missing.Why are distribution companies mistreating this movie? Why is it that Miramax allows two-bit distributors in every European country to molest their products? I wish that A Band Apart (QT-s production company) could see it (and that they slap Miramax for allowing this).If you would like to buy this movie, then avoid this version.

Brilliant Tarantino!,"I have never seen a Quentin Taratino movie that I have yet hated. All his movies are filled with witty dialog, a great cast, and a well-written script. That is no exception for this movie, Jackie Brown. This wonderful film is actually one of his underrated films. When people talk Quentin, they always talk about Pulp Fiction or Inglourious Basterds never this film. This is a gritty crime film that is actually worth watching just for the dialog alone.Jackie Brown is about how six different people could end up with a lot of money if they are the first to get it. We have a shady gun salesman, a lonely jail bond guy, a no-nonsense airline clerk, a coke-happy girl, an honest cop, and another shady guy just released from jail after serving time for bank robbery.What is always good about Quentin is that he knows how to cast his movies. That proves to be no exception here. I just loved the main cast and their personalities. If I had to choose, I would have picked Samuel L. Jackson as my favorite character in this film. I'm happy to say that this film also resurrected Pam Grier's career and got Robert Forster recognized by the Academy.Overall, this is almost the perfect Quentin film. It has the well-written dialog and the great chemistry between the actors. This film reminded me of Pulp Fiction style-wise, but it has a whole new tone to it. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Plays like a fine-tuned, well-oiled mechanism","Jackie Brown is so far the first and only time Quentin Tarantino wrote an adapted screenplay, based on Elmore Leonard's novel ""Rum Punch"", and it plays like a fine-tuned, well-oiled mechanism. Compared to Tarantino's other films, this is a cleaner, more genre-faithful crime story. And he even tones down the violence, which here is often hidden from view and filmed in a 1970s tradition. Jackie Brown is first and foremost about plotting and characters, all of which are penned, played out and photographed in a way that makes the film dance elegantly on a fine line between stark realism and a celebration of Hollywood's crime movie-tradition. The latter, of course, has always been an important element in Tarantino's films, but in Jackie Brown he uses it for effect more than to make a statement. The film doesn't come off as post-anything - it's right in the thick of it, completely unaware of the tradition it belongs to, and thus a lot less self-conscious and self-referring than most of Tarantino's other films. This immediacy lifts the crime story and basic premise of the picture, which is as clever as it is uninhibited. And it is helped along and lifted by some typically meritable narrative tricks from Tarantino, who toys with perspectives and timelines. There are without exception brilliant performances from the entire eclectic cast, which is superbly selected by Tarantino. None more so than Pam Grier and Robert Forster, who enjoyed well-earned career-rejuvinations as a result of their work.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

JackiE Brown- A Tarantino Movie,"Jackie Brown is a 44 year old air hostess who also acts as a money carrier for her boss, gun dealer Ordell Robbie. When one of Ordell's other employee's is caught he is forced to kill him, however, before he can get to him the employee tells the police about Jackie and they pick her up. With Jackie facing jail or being killed by Ordell she strikes a deal with both the police and him to bring in a large stash of money. However to help her retirement she plans to play the game to her own ends. The film is still full of Tarantinoisms for the fans - the heavy soundtrack, the pop culture references, the witty, slick dialogue. It is in Jackie and Max where Tarantino has grown up a bit - although in fairness this was an adaptation rather than his own script, but he still manages them better than some of his own thin characters. Tarantino takes a breather between Pulp and the Kill Bill movies here with a nonviolent drama. It's slow, but it's refreshing. The characters are all well conceived and all of them sustain and give an extra strength to the plot. I appreciate especially two acting jobs: The one by Samuel Jackson, which does one more time the role he does best; Pam Grier, who plays the main role (JACKIE BROWN), and does a magnificent work playing a strong and intelligent woman that can deceive everyone and ends fulfilling her goal. About DeNiro's role, LOUIS GARA, which is not a very important to this movie, I think he does a character with a personality from what I'm used to watch in other movies. Here, he's silent and nervous and almost seems like a ""poor little devil"" thief.I think Tarantino did a great job one more time. It's not a masterpiece like PULP FICTION or Kill Bill but it's a great film and must watch for any movie buff Overall I enjoy this film and can understand why it will never be loved to the extent that Pulp was and is. However to me this is a satisfying film with an enjoyable plot and a more traditional delivery. The development of actual good characters beyond snappy dialogue is what impressed me the most.My Rating- 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Quentin Tarantino at his best, that's right I said it!","What a good heist movie! Extremely entertaining for such a straight foward plot. The characters stories all tie together brilliantly!     The characters were just about all hilarious and Samuel Jackson's performance was probably the funniest I've ever seen him. The music in it is so catchy and suits the movie to a T. This movie is so much more up beat and refreshing then either pulp fiction or resoviour dogs, but it's suppose to be so the comparsion of Jackie Brown to those movies is unfair in that respect. I believe that Jackie Brown is a demonstration of Tarantino's continuous evoling talent and diversity in direction. Plenty could argue with me that pulp fiction and resoviour dogs are better directed than jackie brown,and maybe they're right.

Word Play and Gun Play: A Tarantino-Lover's Delight,"This delightfully disrespectful adaptation of Elmore Leonard's ""Rum Punch"" features the return of Pam Grier to the big screen, along with Robert Forster as a stoic bail bondsman and Samuel L. Jackson recreating his signature archetypal criminal type. Set in a Los Angeles that is as metaphorically far away from Tinseltown as possible, the movie follows grizzled flight attendant Jackie Brown as she tries to rescue herself from her own troubled life. The stars shine, although Robert De Niro's one-dimensional character could have been played by a trained gorilla.  Lighter than ""Pulp"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"", this movie was mislabeled as being Tarantino Lite. Rest assured that this movie features enough clever word play and gun play along with the plentiful expletives that are Tarantino hallmarks.

The director that will never made a bad movie.,"In my opinion this is Tarantinos weakest movie and to be honest for maybe 45 minutes in the middle, this movie is kind of boring. I know it was to capture the Elmore Leonard talking feeling, but it just did not work out for me. It's also Tarantinos least re-watchable movie in my opinion.I know it's many people out there who say that Death Proof is Tarantinos weakest movie and for you, I recommend you to check out my Death Proof review.With that said I still think Jackie Brown is a solid movie. The characters are good and the story have to be Tarantinos most realistic. The soundtrack works perfectly even if it's one song I dislike, I can still see that it is important to set up the tone. The opening and the ending works very well and especially the 3 perspective shopping montage that feels both clever and original (If it's not stolen from another movie). And the camera work just screams Tarantino, so you still know who is behind the movie.And my final line is this: This guy will never made a bad movie.Death proof was a dead project from the beginning because the Grind house genre is not a very serious one and I would still think most people would agree that it's one of the better movies in it's genre. And this one is still a solid film that works and doesn't lose hes reputation after making Pulp Fiction (One of the greatest movies of all time) that would have give most directors goosebumps. Just the idea of after making two adrenaline pumped movies going back and making this one, just say so much about how skilled and controlled Tarantino is as a director and that's why he will never do a bad movie.This is a solid film that I would have cut a bit in the middle.It's my least favorite movie in Tarantinos filmography and I don't even think it's in my top 100-150.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tarantino keeps rolling,"Quentin Tarantino made a promising debut with Reservoir Dogs. His 2nd film, Pulp Fiction is simply amazing. His next film, Jackie Brown is another great effort from this gifted film maker. If you see this movie with an open mind and don't expect it to be another Pulp Fiction, you will enjoy it. It's not as fast-paced as Pulp and with alot less violence and profanity, but is a very entertaining film.Jackie Brown marks the first time Tarantino has adapted someone else's work. In this case, Elmore Leonard's novel Rum Punch. Leonard's books, like Stephen King's and Michael Crichton's, translate very nicely to the big screen. The book was great and Tarantino follows it pretty closely. The one major change is white Jackie Burke becomes black Jackie Brown. This happens so he could cast Pam Grier in the lead role. She is terrific in this. Robert Forster, another 70's star rescued from oblivion is very good, too. They join John Travolta as actors whose careers have been revived thanks to Mr. Tarantino.Robert DeNiro, Bridget Fonda and Michael Keaton are good in small roles unlike any I've seen them play before. Samuel L. Jackson is wonderful as always. Jackie Brown is a very enjoyable movie with an awesome soundtrack. It is not an original Tarantino story and is unlike either of his first 2 movies, but is alot of fun. Tarantino comes through again. I'm looking forward to seeing more films from him in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Gets better and better, both by age and as the story progresses","It's easy to dismiss this film as one of Tarantino's lesser popular films. But if you look closer, it's actually really good. This is a film that can't be compared to Tarantino's previous two movies, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. It features elements from both films, but is overall a more mature, straight-forward film. It's a character driven film, like any other Tarantino film, however it is slow, but in a good way. Nothing's rushed, we get a lot of time to study the different characters. The dialogue is witty and clever, just like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Then there's the realism, which is excellently portrayed. People act and talk like it was just a normal day, which makes it an absorbing experience, and will make you forget that the actors are actually acting, and that there's actually a film crew behind the scene.Then there's the ensemble cast. All six of the main characters each have different point of views, watching them do what they do is simply fascinating. This is one of those films where the ensemble cast works really well. All of the characters have their part in the story, nobody is miscast. It features Pam Grier, Samuel L. Jackson, Robert Forster, Michael Keaton, Bridget Fonda and Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro is very amusing, his performance is the best (out of all the great performances in the film). It's fun to watch him in this film just for validating the fact that he doesn't always get type-casted. Pam Grier and Robert Forster are excellent as well, and Samuel L. Jackson nails his role, which is somewhat identical to his character in Pulp Fiction, though that's not a bad thing.This is another must-see Tarantino film - Moose finds this film worthy of a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""Jackie Brown"" (1997)","Directed by: Quentin Tarantino
Genre: Crime, Drama, ThrillerPLOT:
""Jackie Brown is a middle-aged airline stewardess who supplements her income by smuggling arms for crime kingpin Ordell Robbie. One day she is caught and the agents offer her a deal in order to apprehend Robbie. Robbie, however, is onto the threat and tries to have Brown eliminated. What follows is a dangerous game of bluff, deceit and betrayal.""REVIEW:
Recently watched Jackie Brown which is an adaptation of Elmore Leonard's 1992 novel Rum Punch. It is the only feature-length film that Tarantino has adapted from a previous work. It was hilarious, goofy and the overall humor was used pretty well, it was mostly a regular crime drama. Some people might claim it to be Tarantino's weakest or second weakest film but I don't think that's really the case here. In my opinion this was Tarantino's one of the most realistic and grounded work, the characters felt real and almost believable. Although the direction was great but didn't really liked the adapted screenplay, the whole narrative seemed lackluster but it's presentation somewhat made it better. Some sequences felt incomplete as if something was missing. It would've be alot better if some of the areas of the plot would've been explored more. It was less Tarantino-ish rather it felt like more of a regular crime drama with little to no violence / gore which imo was a great idea as it was somewhat different and showcased QT's potentials even more. It mainly focused on the characters rather than the plot itself. The characters were written really well and were acted even better. Subtle and realistic acting is one of the reasons to watch this movie. A combination of Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Samuel L. Jackson & Robert De Niro really worked their charm in bringing the best out of their characters especially Pam Grier, definitely a topnotch performance, really loved her character. And secondly I thought QT's used Samuel L. Jackson's character really well and the way Jackson acted it was something admirable, it was a memorable antagonist.Jackie Brown will surely grow on you and you may have to watch certain parts more than once to grasp it but it all comes together in the last hour but they didn't really handled the thrill and suspense of the film that accurately as at times it felt sluggish but maybe it was because the runtime was a bit long. Also wasn't really satisfied with the ending, I mean it was good and all but it could've been alot more interesting and convincing than it was. Cinematography was good but the camerawork was even better. Another notable thing was the color palette, it provided a grim and eye catching look to the movie. The soundtracks really had a Tarantino-esque vibe and they synced pretty well with the whole universe and vibe of the film.Overall the movie had a few shortcomings but mostly subjective depending upon person to person. Finally I'd say the film was a different experience as far as QT's filmography goes and one might consider it as an underrated flick. It was an enjoyable, funny and a hilarious ride. If you're looking for a movie to enjoy and lighten the mood then definitely go for it. Not a masterpiece but definitely a great movie.Final Verdict: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Calm,"Like in the Pulp Fiction` segment with John Travolta and Samuel Jackson, we experience a certain, deplaced calmness here. The movie runs two and a half hours and singular scenes are longer than usual. There are hardly any violent scenes in the movie, no bloodshed; language is the only reason why I couldn't watch the movie before I was sixteen. The music is from the seventies and also quite slow and melancholic. Pam Grier was famous in the seventies and Robert Forster himself even looks like coming straight from a twenty-year old TV series. This calmness  that is the result of all these facts  had a great fascination on me. It produced a fantastic suspense and if the dialogues were not typical for Tarantino I would say, it's a very Hitchcock-like film.If there was an Oscar for casting, this film would have won it. That unusual mix of well-known and coming-back actors, all together doing a great job, makes the film most interesting from the start. 9 stars out of 10.Actually, there is nothing to complain about, as long as you see the film only once. When I saw it a second time, the dialogues started to get a little tiring and I asked myself: Do they really have to be so long each? So don't watch it twice one after the other.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Jackie Brown,"Jackie Brown is a stewardess in mid-life malaise, toiling at a third rate Mexican airline while moonlighting as a cash courier for a gun runner (Jackson) who ties up loose ends like nobody's business (Bang!). When one of Ordell's operatives gets arrested (Tucker), the ""cheese eating rat"" spills, putting Miss Brown in the clutches of the crime fighters (Keaton Bowen), she cutting a deal to get clean of a dubious federal drug charge and maybe swing a ""tidy sum ($)"" in the process so she can finally fund that IRA.Pam 'Foxy' Grier stars for director Quentin Tarantino in a crime drama genre for which she was well known, but this time, rather than bullets & buckshot settling the issue, the 70s black action heroine uses brains, her's and those of a beguiled bondsman (Forster) to outwit the crooks & coppers. It's the kitchen table talk between Brown and Max Cherry that is the special moment to tuck in your mind's drawer if you be like me, one who never mastered the money game (""I always feel like I'm starting over""). And take time to appreciate Jackie Wear, courtesy of designer Mary Claire Hannan. We know Pam would look good in just about anything, even that proverbial potato sack (Travilla), but I'm partial to her b&w ensemble, Cabo blue blazer (""Booyah!"") & terry cloth robe worn over cups of Maxwell House®, ""the, uh, stuff that dreams are made of.""Co-stars Bridget Fonda as the freckle face with the cutest toes in town who gets a bit TOO cute for her own good (gulp), Michael Keaton is the T-Man, Bob De Niro in a rare support role, Mike Bowen, Tom Lister, Sid Haig as the judge and Samuel Jackson is orderly Ordell who's a soft spot for surfer girls. The obscure soundtrack could've brought the whole thing down (Delfonics) but a strong story (Leonard), skilled players, keen eye (Navarro) & artful edit (Menke) can survive even the most esoteric scores. Had she a Roberta Flack in her vinyl stack or Max some Ozark Mountain Daredevils amongst his car cassette dreams (Jackie Blue), this one would've ranked with compelation greats Easy Rider, American Graffiti, Boogie Nights & Goodfellas. The crime drama and clever-to-kooky characters with their tense interplay will keep you glued and, when it's over, leave a satisfied smile on your face (No one holds a closing like Jackie: ""He's got a gun!"").

There are no fast paced scenes, fireworks, blood, sex and all that 'noise' that would normally get you excited. So what is it then?

Excellent in every way,"Jackie Brown is Tarantino's most mature, and fully realized film to date. A superb cast, an excellent story/script and Tarantino's understated yet assured direction lead us into a film with wit, and plenty of heart but not a sentimental bone in it's body.Pam Grier as the title character is simply a revelation, beautiful, funny, and absorbing. She embodies this every woman effortlessly. The fact that she was not nominated for an Oscar says more about the Academy than it does about her work.Samuel L. Jackson has never been better, and Robert DeNiro has not had such a good role since Scorcese lost the plot.In a perfect cast there are two real surprises here, Bridget Fonda comes pretty damn close to stealing the film. I have watched this film several times and I still laugh whenever she is on screen. Someone please build a comedy around this neglected comic talent!

A true work of genius,"Watching Jackie Brown again on a big screen, as I had the pleasure of doing last night, reminded me of what an utterly superb piece of film making this was by Quentin Tarantino. There isn't a single wasted shot, scene or line in it, and the two and a half hour running time passed in a thoroughly enjoyable manner. From the opening shots of Pam Grier rushing through the airport to the strains of Across 110th Street, the story unfolds in a gentle but gripping way that allows the characters to breath and become far greater than the sum of their parts.And what a story it is, with Tarantino's vision of the Elmore Leonard novel, Rum Punch, really bringing a vivid life and colour to the intrigue and uncertainty. The performances all work well, with Grier looking as sassy and sexy as any woman I think I've seen on screen, and her counterparts equally stepping up to the plate and delivering. Robert Forster convinces as nice-guy Max, the integrity of the man not overshadowed by his willingness to live on the edges of legality. Jackson and De Niro as the odd bad couple are funny and convincing in their engagements, with the added frisson of Bridget Fonda stirring up the mix.The music is used brilliantly, adding to both the action and the events on screen and seeing it again in a cinema reminds one of just how good the camera work and editing really are. Its sumptuous to look at and quite compelling as you're swept along, particularly a long urgent take in the mall the second time around. I was still seeing things that I had missed in the various times I've watched this on DVD since it's release and I really can't recommend it enough. His best work in my opinion, measured, humorous, thoughtful, well-structured and utterly eminently watchable.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good, engrossing flick","It's fantastic to see Tarantino expand his horizons with this gem of a movie. I think it took a lot of guts to make this film, it was bound to receive a lot of flak-a lot of Pfiction and Rdogs fans found this dreary and tedious.With a superb cast like this, how can you go wrong? Forster definitely great> deserved his Oscar for this one. Very interesting camera work and performances makes this one movie you need to watch more than once.The only misstep I felt was the casting of Michael Keaton.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
***/4,"Good Tarantino movie, not as good as pulp fiction but better than resevoir dogs. Stars Pam Grier as a down and out flight attendant who will do anything to change her luck for a better life. Robert DeNiro was especially funny in this movie and Bridget Fonda was looking especially sexy in this one. A scene involving them beginning in a shopping mall and ending in a parking lot had me sidesplitting in laughter. The score was really good but I had a few problems with the script which relied on too much chance to get things going. Also Pam Grier's character I really had no sympathy for her because all of her problems were caused by HER decisions not by the cruel hand of fate. Anyway the directing is outstanding and so is the acting so i gave this one a good scorePros: Acting, comedic situatons, score, directingCons: Script, themes.Bottom line: With tarantino you can always expect above average or better, this one was good.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
beautiful love story,"There's something beautiful about a character who has grown, experienced life's many letdowns, first hand, and emerged from an angry, vengeful, egotistical, attention-seeking twirp into a reticent, humble, calmer, sadder/happier adult.  How do you feel about getting older?  This is the question of the movieI'm getting older.  Pam Grier and Robert Forester, in their roles, reminded me of the grace that comes with age.  I've read other comments on this board, about how some people feel that this film almost gave us the impression that we have been living with these people for some time, and gotten to know them pretty well.  I feel like I definitely got to know them. That sad quality of Robert Forester, the melancholic mood, it's become more and more a part of my character.  The unrequited aspect of the plot, it too is something I can identify with.  And Pam's character, she's such a wonderful person anyway.  She's had her hard knocks, in real life.  Haven't we all?  But she wears it well.   To me this is a triumph of character. Jackie triumphs over the people she must overcome, while staying true to the one person who is true to her: Max Cherry.  Max is true to just about everyone, and he is the most sympathetic character in the filmI saw Reservoir Dogs when it came out, and loved it.  I laughed when a friend described it as the 'feel good movie of the year'.  I thought Pulp Fiction was, to a certain extent, a sell out, in that it took the basic ideas of Reservoir Dogs, and made them more saleable by virtue of the big names: Bruce Willis and John Travolta.  So, when the bad reviews came in for Jackie Brown, I figured his goose was cooked.  Here we are in January 2003, and I only just saw Jackie Brown for the first time one month ago.  It has become my new favorite film.  It has replaced the Sorrow and the Pity as the 'regular' flick in my VCR.  I think I have seen it eight times, or moreI'd say this is his best film yet.  Granted, we needed the other two films to get to the point where we are now, but his story of redemption, and tender, unrequited love, the acting, the soundtrack, the casting (except De Niro, who was underplaying to a fault) - it's a combination that I can't easily forget.My favorite scenes are, first, when Max meets Jackie at the gate, as that song is playing.  And, second, in their last meeting, the tender kiss and the even more poignant look on Max's face as he excuses himself from his phone conversation to look out the window, with that 8 year old look on his face, I can feel his stomach getting sockedIt's a bittersweet film.  It's a calmer film.For those who say it isn't 'Pulp Fiction', or at that level, all I can say is that I actually prefer Jackie Brown.  These characters are loveable. Even Samuel Jackson's dispicable character is otherwise loveable, or at least valuableI love the people who put this movie together",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
