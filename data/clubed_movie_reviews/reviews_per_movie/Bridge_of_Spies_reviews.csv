"Legal/historical drama, not action","Don't be fooled by the title. Make sure you know what you're getting yourself into when you watch this film. Bridge of Spies is literally about the Cold War Bridge of Spies, where Soviet/US spies were exchanged through negotiations. This is nothing like ""The Americans"" (FX TV drama - for some high unrealistic and over-sexualized espionage action - redirect here) and the most action-packed scene you will see is Francis Gary Powers getting shot out of his U2 plane during his mission.Bridge of Spies is really a historical/legal drama. And based on my preliminary research, they seem to be getting most of their facts right. Obviously a little bit embellished for Hollywood's sake, Bridge of Spies does a fine job as a historical docudrama. There is a lot of talking, but it's meaningful talking. At times, the film can be a little slow {opening scene, especially}, but give it a chance and you might enjoy it. History buffs like myself will definitely enjoy it. But thrill-seekers, you're better off to see the new James Bond movie instead.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An organic wonder.,"Bridge of spies is not your typical movie, it almost seems like it would be boring, except it isn't. This film is like a tree that you drive by on your way to work. Nothing special, quite ordinary; and then one day you see it from a different angle, and the way the dew glistening off of its leaves catches the sunlight, just takes your breath away.As I mentioned before, bridge of spies is different, it doesn't have a particularly memorable score, or poetic dialogue, every character is portrayed as a ""regular guy/gal"". The credit must go to the Coen brothers here. The actors lines, particularly the exchanges between Hanks' and Rylance's characters are stirring in their simplicity. The story unfolds similarly, everything sort of just happens, and at the end, it all fits together perfectly.Nobody knows, what makes Spielberg so great, is it his groundbreaking camera work? or perhaps his implementation of cutting edge visual effects? In my humble opinion it is his enigmatic ability to take what would likely be dull and uninteresting in the hands of any other director, and turn it into a thing of wonder. This movie plays out naturally, with moments of subtle heroism, and true human emotion, it is so very downplayed, that one simply cannot pull their eyes away. Bridge of Spies is truly an Organic Wonder.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""And the Best Supporting Actor Oscar goes to... Mark Rylance""","There are combinations of film makers that make you confident, as you pay your ticket price, that you are not going to be terribly disappointed: Steven Spielberg directing; Tom Hanks taking the lead; Janusz Kaminski behind the camera; Michael Kahn editing and a Coen brothers script (with Matt Charmon (Suite Française)). And Bridge of Spies doesn't disappoint, particularly for someone of my more advanced years (I was born the year following the film's climatic events) who remembers well the terror of potential nuclear catastrophe that hung over the world through the 60's and 70's.In a story based on true events, Hanks plays James Donovan (diverging somewhat from reality here) as an insurance lawyer dragged by his firm into defending Rudolf Abel, the accused Soviet spy played exquisitely by British stage acting legend Mark Rylance. Against this backdrop, the international blue touch paper is about to be lit by the shooting down over Russia of Gary Powers (Austin Stowell from ""Whiplash"") in his U-2 spy plane (sorry – ""article""). Donovan becomes instrumental in unofficially negotiating on behalf of the US government the release of Powers in East Berlin. The deal is jeopardized by his boy-scout tendencies to also want to help another US captive Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers).I've read some negative reviews of this film in the papers that made me quite cross, describing it as ""yawnsome"" and ""sanctimoniously dull"". For me, nothing could be further from the truth and the packed Saturday night audience I saw this with seemed equally gripped from beginning to end, silent save for the odd laugh where some appropriate humor is weaved into the story.Tom Hanks is solid and believable as the fish-out-of-water lawyer, albeit that the role is played with a large spoonful of patriotic American sugar as Donovan trumpets about the importance of the constitution over the lynch-mob mentality of the general public. Alan Alda – great to see again on the big screen – channels his best Hawkeye-style exasperation as Donovan's boss, looking for a clean and quick conviction.But it is Mark Rylance – an irregular player in movies, and due to appear again in next year's ""BFG"" – who shines out as the acting star of the film. His salubrious and calm turn as the cornered spy just reeks of class and if he isn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor nomination for this then there is no justice. (A special 'casting recognition award' to my wife Sue for spotting that the actress playing Judge Byer's wife – Le Clanché du Rand – was Meg Ryan's mother in Sleepless in Seattle 22 years ago!)The cinematography is superb with some gorgeous tracking shots and framed scenes. Most outstanding of all is the scene depicting the traumatic construction of the Berlin wall – long tracking shots in greys and blues delivering a truly breathtaking piece of cinema. In general I'd give a big shout-out to both the art department and the special effects team in making the desolation of East Berlin feel so real. It makes the similar scenes, that I commented positively on in the recent ""Man from U.N.C.L.E."" seem like an amateur school production.The special effects team also contribute in making the shooting down of the U-2 a thrilling piece of cinema.Music is sparingly and effectively used by Thomas Newman, and it can be no greater complement to the composer than that I was wondering until the end titles as to whether it was another Spielberg/ John Williams collaboration or not.A great film, one of my favorites this year. Highly recommended, especially if you are over 50. You should also get out to a cinema to see this one – it will be far more effective on the big screen than the small one.(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

"A very good, very Spielberg motion picture, starring Tom Hanks.","This movie hit me really strangely.I was expecting a political drama about the cold war, and while indeed it was that, I was not expecting to have so much fun and for Bridge of Spies to be so humorous.The Coen brothers writing a movie Steven Spielberg would direct just sounds like a winning combination and it really was. Sealing the deal, was a great performance by Tom Hanks.Tom Hanks does what he does best, by playing an everyday man in an average life. James Donovan was just an insurance lawyer who gets caught up in the middle of the Cold War. Bridge of Spies, starts him off so normal and then turns his life into quite an adventure.And I do mean adventure. In the hands of Spielberg, the movie's visuals were large and epic. I was expecting this movie to feel more like his last flick, Lincoln. Instead it feels more like Indiana Jones, as James Donovan travels to Berlin at the time when the wall was being completed.Watching Hanks play Donovan who is just swept into an overwhelming situation and just keeps his cool and his charm is just highly enjoyable.Totally loved Bridge of Spies, It's one of the best team ups between Hanks and Spielberg and even though Lincoln was a great movie, Bridge of Spies is everything Spielberg is capable of. So entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,History
One of Spielberg's best most recent movies,"Bridge Of Spies is a historical drama film starring Tom Hanks, co-written by the Coen brothers, and directed by Steven Spielberg. Even though its subject matter of the Cold War is something I know very little about, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I am now more interested than ever to learn more about it. I rank it among the best of Spielberg's most recent movies.In 1957, tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War are at their peak. Spies from both the American CIA and Soviet KGB are a major threat to the security of both world powers and each side often resorts to hasty measures to stop any classified information from being leaked. In Brooklyn, New York, Rudolf Abel is arrested under the suspicion of being a spy. James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned as Abel's defence lawyer. However the idea of defending a potential Soviet spy proves to be an unpopular and difficult task for Donovan. Meanwhile, over in the Soviet Union, an American spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down and captured by the KGB. As a means to ease tension between the two warring countries, Donovan proposes a swap between the two prisoners of war, Abel for Powers.Despite containing barely any action scenes and being almost entirely made up of talking, the film never feels boring or slow paced. This is most likely due to the Coen brothers' clever screenplay and Steven Spielberg's creative direction. There were many suspenseful moments where it felt like the prisoner negotiations would go horribly wrong and that kept me on the edge of my seat. Tom Hanks also gives another memorable performance as James B. Donovan, once again proving his versatility as an actor.I rate it 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Spielberg and Hanks--fry to find a better duo than that for a great film.,"""Everyone deserves a defense. Everyone matters."" James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks)In Bridge of Spies, Steven Spielberg once again masterfully goes to the historical drama with a righteous man's theme (think Schindler and Lincoln for starters). This time lawyer James B. Donovan is asked to defend an accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Able (Mark Rylance, superb), in order to show the world the American justice system is democratic.The story is ""inspired by true events"" with the outline of the exchange of Able for U-2 downed pilot Gary Powers historically accurate. As usual, Spielberg recreates the times with the atmosphere, cars, and film noir aspect of a spy thriller in the figurative and literal Cold War. He said, ""I always wanted to tell the stories that really interested me in my personal life—which are stories about things that actually happened.""Hanks is central to Spielberg's vision of the lone hero defying the odds and supporting the highest ideals of the American Constitution and the individually virtuous man. Never does Hanks overplay the good-guy card; he's just very adept at playing an everyman not always right but always righteous.The dialogue is crisp, a no fooling around typical of Spielberg and Hanks but a charming bad guy as well: James Donovan: ""Aren't you worried?"" Rudolf Abel: ""Would it help?"" As producer Kristie Macosko Krieger commented about Spielberg, ""He's got a childlike sense of wonder. He never gets tired of hearing stories . . . . "" Bridge of Spies is vintage Spielberg with a Lincoln-like atmosphere, righteous hero, and intriguing multi-plot, an entertaining spy story brimming with humanity.As the director says, ""This is more about very smart people in conversation with each other, and the sword of Damocles hanging over their heads is that, if they make the wrong decisions, it's the end of the world.""",,Anonymous,History
Good rendering of events but emotions are missing,"The depiction of historical aspects seemed very well done, and the settings and period elements were great. It's an interesting story but the reason it's only a 6 for me is that I felt like the film was almost sterile, lacking in the emotions of the characters to a degree. Almost more like a history lesson than a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A solid and effective piece of filmmaking through and through,"Following ""War Horse"" and ""Lincoln,"" ""Bridge of Spies"" rounds out Steven Spielberg's trilogy of histories in the 2010s, each film earning a Best Picture nomination for being a superb piece of craft — and having Spielberg's name attached.None of these are bad, but they are extremely traditional films evoking the prestige dramas of the '90s and not necessarily offering anything new. As such, ""Bridge of Spies"" doesn't shed new light on Cold War history, but it does tell a small story with of inspirational characters with a lot of heart.Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, an insurance attorney asked to represent a recently detained Soviet spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). A proud Constitutionalist of sorts, Donovan decides it's his honor and duty to give one of America's most hated men his right to a defense. Then, when a U.S. pilot is captured in Soviet territory, the CIA recruits Donovan to negotiate a swap.""Bridge of Spies"" echoes ""Lincoln"" in its portrayal of a morally tenacious man who stood firm in the face of opposition. Putting an actor as likable Hanks in the role of someone as upstanding and charming as Donovan is almost unfair. The script, treated by Mark Charman and also the Coen brothers, builds clever scenes for Hanks to navigate through with total ease. The story doesn't push or challenge the veteran, but it does frame everything that's happening with the appropriate weight, enough so that we can connect with everything Donovan is going through and respect the decisions he makes and Hanks helps communicate those stakes. The Cold War was an ugly time; it might seem that what Donovan did and how he approached his responsibilities was a moral no-brainer, but it was actually quite complicated and extremely unpopular.Rylance as well is a an excellent stroke of casting genius. More known for his stage work, the veteran creates a portrait of a man so self-assured it's frightening. It's the kind of nuanced supporting role that is easy to overlook when most award-winning supporting turns are flashy scene-stealers.Spielberg and longtime director of photography Janusz Kaminski give ""Bridge of Spies"" such richness. This is a film driven by plot and acting, but the picture is pristine. In particular, the way they capture East Berlin during the negotiations scenes is feels haunting in a way few films taking place in that similar time and place have. Also, the visual symbolism of reflections and different perspectives is something Spielberg plays with subtly but enough so to put some artistic flourishes on his film. Most importantly, the climactic bridge sequence works on every level, and that alone proves Spielberg, cast and crew all did their job.When Spielberg is done directing, ""Bridge of Spies"" will probably not make anyone's list of his top films, but it shows that just about any corner of history can make for an excellent film in capable hands.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Turkey Without The Gravy,"I am biased in my review of BRIDGE OF SPIES. The Cold War is my thing, always has been my thing. I am dazzled by that time in history: surveillance, the cars, CIA, Eisenhower, and the mystique of John Fitzgerald Kennedy.From the trailer of this film, I expected a delicious plate of Cold War atmosphere, intrigue, and commentary. Like a gleeful child, I sprinted to the movie theatre – expecting a non-pretentious high octane version of Mad Men. I anticipated my favorite era in history being served up like LET ME IN (a piece of 1980s period perfection elegantly directed by Matt Reeves).I held close the trailer as I landed my perfect middle seat in the theatre. The clips of a U2 Surveillance jet spiraling at 70,000 feet, children overflowing in tears as they watch a thermonuclear film strip, and Tom Hanks' face plastered to a subway window as we see guards firing at bystanders trying to climb over the Berlin Wall.Then you add Steven Spielberg to the mix – the master of the period piece – modern cinema - the evoker of our deepest emotions. One of my favorite Spielberg films is Munich. Munich captures the violence of the Middle East 70s with revere, respect, and revelation. This is what I wanted from Bridge Of Spies. I wanted a dark, harrowing portrait of the Cold War, I wanted this tense era exposed in Spielbergian fashion, and I wanted to have 1957-1961 ruminating in my heart, mind, and belly. Bridge of Spies, however, met none of my desired expectations.Diluted by a PG-13 rating, filled with comedic moments (clearly due to the Coen Brothers having written or participated in this script) that don't tickle my fancy, and an avoidance of Cold War atmosphere – Bridge Of Spies hit me like a tennis ball on the head.It's taught, adequately plotted, and the hero is smart, likable, and witty. It's garnered rave reviews. But, for anyone that likes substance, don't look here. Spielberg's story is a moral tale – of courage and standing up for one's ideals – the universal plot which Steven devours like a hungry child.Unfortunately, there's no stakes. Hanks follows his journey and does what he does best – but his universe is given little context. You'll want turkey and you'll get turkey – but you're not getting any gravy.**Possible Spoilers – Things that bugged me about the film was plethora of wasted opportunities. When you have Spielberg at the helm, you know what could have been –1. The relationship between the Lawyer (Hanks) and the Soviet Captive (Mark Rylance) is an unbalanced paper weight. We get a glimpse into the Lawyer's character, the archetypal Tom Hanks - fair, honest, moral, etc. We get very little info on the Captive. He is quiet, dignified, and keeps responding to Hanks wondering if he is aware of his dire situation, ""Would it help?"" Rylance is the typical Spielbergian ""caught in the middle guy"" – much like Ben Kingsley in Schindler's List. Physically weak, trapped and powerless - yet stoic and unafraid. That being said, what are his motives? He is a spy but what drives him – where is the monologue where he explains his background, what formed and shaped him and what forms the basis of his lifelong goals?2. What I love about Mad Men is its strong focus on the media and culture of the era. Except for the end of Bridge of Spies (where we get a clip of Pierre Salinger informing the news of the spy swap) and an early scene of a teenage girl watching a late night story, there's not much to nibble on – Spielberg wastes a huge opportunity in a class room scene where kids are watching a nuclear bomb film strip. Lifting the film strip like a YouTube Clip and then showing a few generic shots of kids watching it and one girl crying - the master of modern cinema stumbles and falls into shallow surf. In this instance, I wanted to yell at the editor – build this up, let it seep in, give us some Wonder Years or Let Me In flavor. There's none to be had –3. Not only do we get a vapid Francis Gary Powers – due to lackluster character development and the miscasting (in my opinion), but the U2 Surveillance storyline is about 12 minutes. Give me at least 25, Steven!! When the U2 is shot out of the sky, we get about a minute of action – give us three. In addition, because Francis Gary Powers has no character development, I don't sympathize with him or even care if he comes home.4. The PhD student who is included in the Prisoner Swap is devoid of character – another guy that I could care less if he makes it home. Both guys appeared to have a lackluster indifferent time over the in the USSR. The Soviets dowsed Powers with water and German soldiers rip up the PHD students thesis paper – oh no!5. There is no discussion of the disastrous political implications of the U2 being shot down over the Soviet Union. Reluctant to authorize the mission, Eisenhower was smeared by its failure and left office of the President on a black cloud. However, we don't hear Eisenhower's name mentioned once in the story.All and all, Spielberg delivers a cup of vanilla ice cream with fudge – most audiences are going to love Hanks and the Soviet spy.In the final analysis, it's a buddy film with some period costumes and a somewhat poignant conclusion. That being said, those that want a stirring pot of fear, sadness, and elation – I suggest you wait for this on HBO and watch Munich instead.Ted's Personal Enjoyment: C+",6.0,Anonymous,History
"An unshowy Steven Spielberg does a master's job with Cold War tensions, honoring a real-life attorney's victory over fear.","A feel-good Cold War melodrama, Bridge of Spies is an absorbing true-life espionage tale very smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. In its grown-up seriousness and basis in historical conflict, Steven Spielberg's first feature since Lincoln three years ago joins the list of the director's half-dozen previous ""war"" films, but in its honoring of an American civilian who pulled off a smooth prisoner exchange between the East and West during a very tense period, the film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does now. Spielberg's fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, which world- premiered at the New York Film Festival and opens commercially on October 16, looks to generate stout box-office returns for Disney through the autumn season. For people of Spielberg's generation, the early years of the nuclear era and the stand-off between the United States and the Soviet Union represents a significant part of the fabric of childhood. With the passage of time, it's possible to tell stories of the time without furnishing them with overt propagandistic overlays, and for Westerners there is the added built-in appeal of the ""we won"" factor and the perception that dealing with adversaries was so much simpler then than it is now. As their focus in this impeccably rendered recreation of a moment in history, most palpably represented by the building of the Berlin Wall, Spielberg and screenwriters Matt Charman and Ethan and Joel Coen have chosen a sort-of Atticus Finch of the north, a principled, American Everyman insurance attorney unexpectedly paged to represent a high-level Soviet spy caught in New York. There is no question that Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is guilty, but James B. Donovan (Hanks), a proper and decent family man with a professional dedication to his client and an abiding loyalty to the principles of the U.S. Constitution, has a quick and intuitive read of any legal situation and shrewdly stays at least one step ahead of the game in almost any situation.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Sometimes People Think Wrong,"I don't know what it is about 2015, but I think this year has been full of films that don't entirely meet your expectations. I don't necessarily mean that those films are bad by any stretch of the imagination, but it seems like film after film end up making me feel a bit letdown. Bridge of Spies is the new Steven Spielberg directed film based on true events during the cold war. It focuses on James B. Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, who is thrust into representing a supposed Soviet spy in court and Donovan's further involvement in executing an exchange of prisoners with Russia.Much like Crimson Peak, this film is not really what the trailers make it out to be. The trailers heavily focused on the relationship between Donovan and his client, Rudolf Abel. The film gives us maybe 20 minutes between them in the beginning, but really that's all. To me, their relationship and the scenes between Hanks and Mark Rylance, who plays Abel, are easily the best the film has to offer. Even though it's never truly clear as to why Donovan backs this man so much and his motivations behind continuing the negotiations, I really bought into their dynamic. In fact, it's the only true payoff you get in the end is their relationship and its outcome.By no means is Bridge of Spies a bad film, it's not. It doesn't help that it's directed by perhaps the greatest director of all time, in Steven Spielberg. Expectations are sometimes far too high for his films. But I think the problem here is that there's just not a ton of meat to this story and it's one of Spielberg's weaker films in recent memory, but really he doesn't make any bad films. Some things did bother me about his directing here though. For example, there is a character introduced within the first 10 minutes as Donovan's associate and partner. He attends Donovan's family dinner and seems to be set up as help to Donovan and a slight possible romance is hinted at with this character and Donovan's daughter. Well, after one scene we don't see this character ever again.Amy Ryan plays Donovan's wife, who I absolutely adore as an actress, is also incredibly underused. I guess what I'm trying to get across here is that there is no flow to the movie. Or rather, no arc. It's very predictable, being a true story, but the tension isn't there either. It's a slow moving picture with a great climax but not a ton of build to get to that great climax. Surprisingly, this could be contributed to Spielberg. Spielberg does do a great job of taking us to the time of the Cold War. He certainly gives us the feeling that at any moment war could have been truly started by either side. The performances are all really good. Mark Rylance who plays Abel does a magnificent job in his limited screen-time and rightfully never gives one way or another in terms of his innocence. Tom Hanks is, well, Tom Hanks. And Thomas Newman replaces John Williams as the composer and does a wonderful job as he always does. There's a lot to really like about Bridge of Spies, more than not. But for me, it was just a bit of a letdown in its lack of intensity and pay off. I wouldn't have known it was the Coen Bros script and Spielberg's directing if it wasn't for the trailers and marketing.+Rylance & Hanks together+Spielberg transports you to the Cold War+Newman's score+Climax-Lack of intensity-Didn't get enough of Donovan and Abel together7.0/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
"carries a spirit of all-American-ism without being too preachy, keeping a wit about it and Tom Hanks","One of the surprising things about Bridge of Spies is not really that Steven Spielberg directed this story, which tracks the trial and then trade of a Russian spy in 1957 (an exchange for an American pilot, and someone else who I'll get to shortly). It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.It's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).The Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.In a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.Bridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice (""Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters"" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.Two little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.Aside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.",9.0,Anonymous,History
a very odd film,"... but not necessarily a very entertaining one.First -- and this is the key to my review --- semi-biographical films documenting real events do not have to be dull, or tedious, or dark, or lack connection with the viewer.Look at PAWN SACRIFICE, for example, recently reviewed by this reviewer and still very much top of mind.And then we have BRIDGE OF SPIES, a two-plus hour opus that one suspects never would have been greenlighted without you-know-who as the director and you-know-who playing the lead.Presumably we are meant to honor the main character's humanity as he struggles against a corrupt (or possibly insane) system to do the right thing...? If this was the intent, then even a yeoman effort from Hanks fails to make this character connect with the viewer, to resonate. In spite of it all, he comes across as a wildcard pick in a game which he never really understood.And if the events of the last few years are any indication -- this written in 2015 -- it was a game the rest of us never understood either.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Cold War Propaganda,"A new film set in the Cold War era of the 1950's was released a few weeks ago and is apparently a big hit. The plot revolves around James B. Donovan, a simple lawyer who is chosen to defend Colonel Rudolf Abel, a captured Soviet spy, in the midst of an atmosphere of anti-communist hysteria sweeping the US. Later in the movie Mr. Donovan is recruited by CIA to negotiate the release of captured American spies in exchange for Colonel Abel, including U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers who was captured by the Soviets after his spy plane was shot down in Soviet airspace. The tortured tagline of the film sums up the propaganda point to be driven home: ""In the shadow of war, one man showed the world what we stand for."" What we (the US) stand for is supposedly a just and humane society where everyone, even a communist spy, is entitled to a fair trial. This is set against the supposed tyranny and cruelty of communist states.However, the version of events presented in this film and the case it attempts to make in favor of an American system of ""fair play"" can easily be disproved. Many relevant details have been distorted or conveniently left out of the narrative. Also, some facts have been included but presented out of any historical context. Unfortunately, most Americans will passively accept this false narrative without question or without doing any further study of their own. They will accept the movie as being a true recounting of historical events. I could now spend a lot of time discussing every single propaganda element within the film such as the dark and gloomy atmosphere in East Berlin; the scowling faces of the East German border guards; the menacing and hostile demeanor of various communist officials or scenes of torture, but I have decided to take a different approach. I will simply tell the truth of the historical incident that this film is supposedly based on; and I will do it using the memoirs of the two primary American participants in these events - James Donovan and Francis Powers.Let's start by comparing the details and outcomes of the Abel trial in the US with that of Powers' trial in the Soviet Union. Both spies were caught red-handed and so there could be no doubt as to their guilt in both cases. Therefore, the purpose of the trials should have been simply to gather all the facts available in an effort to come up with a suitable punishment to fit the crime. Below, I have included a table that shows the results of each trial.Powers (Soviet trial) Abel (US trial) Held Incommunicado 4 weeks 3 weeks Phys. or Psych. Abuse No Yes Max. Poss. Sentence Death (rare cases) Death (very common) Actual Sentence 10 years 30 yearsPowers stated in his autobiography, written a decade after his return to the US, that he did not suffer any abuse during his captivity in the Soviet Union. Abel, however, said that during his interrogation he was struck in the face by one of the FBI agents who grew frustrated at his silence and refusal to cooperate.Powers was told by the Soviets that execution for espionage was rare in the USSR, but Abel was informed that the death penalty was very likely to be his fate. In fact, just a few years prior to Abel's trial in 1957, the Rosenbergs had been sent to the electric chair for stealing atomic secrets for the Soviet Union. Finally, in the sentences that were eventually handed down, Powers received a relatively light 10 years imprisonment while Abel was given 30 years.The Soviets were accused of subjecting Powers to a ""show trial,"" but this is exactly what the Americans did with Rudolf Abel. As it turns out, despite all the blather about the high ideals of the American legal system, Donovan and his co-conspirators were really just concerned with promoting the idea of superior values of American ""fair play,"" without any regard for the substance behind such claims. Furthermore, the real reason Mr. Donovan argued to save Abel's life was in order to hold him as a bargaining chip in the inevitable event of a spy swap with the Soviets down the road.Mr. Donovan, the humble lawyer, was actually a high-ranking career spy. He admits in his memoirs that at the time he was supposed to be impartially defending Colonel Abel, he was at that moment still a spook! In his own words he reveals that he ""still held a commission as a commander in Naval Intelligence."" Prior to that he had worked as head legal counsel in the OSS (precursor to the CIA) for several years and had helped to organize the CIA after WWII! However, from the insane viewpoint of American exceptionalism nothing here is out of place, but if this film had been done from the Soviet perspective (taking into account the undeniable facts of the incident), the plot might go like this:The US violates Soviet airspace repeatedly until one of their spy planes is finally shot down. The pilot, despite his refusal to denounce the criminal activity of his government, receives a very light sentence in comparison to America's treatment of captured Soviet agents. Some time later, a CIA spymaster shows up in East Berlin demanding the release of three American spies in exchange for one Soviet spy. Although this naturally strikes the Soviets as unfair, due to their good nature they agree. Colonel Abel returns home to a hero's welcome while Francis Powers is received with suspicion, denounced by the media and much of the American public as a traitor, and is held incommunicado by the CIA for ""debriefing"" for nearly a month.

A Well-Acted Cold War Thriller,"Bridge Of Spies is a well acted, thrilling, smart Cold War drama that features a Oscar worthy performance from Tom hanks. Bridge of Spies tells the true story of a Cold War spy swap, during the height of tension between the U.S. and Russia. The time period was so tense that when films can capture that tone it's usually special, that being said the film doesn't quite capture that tone, but it comes close. Tom Hanks performance, and Spielberg's seasoned direction manage to save the film. When the film could have been slow, they save it by using either humor, or great acting, Acting that will most likely get Hanks an Oscar nomination. In the end Bridge of Spies isn't as good as it could have been, but is still admittedly a great film that will undoubtedly get plenty of recognition at the 2015 Academy Awards.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great Spy Thriller,"In 1957, during the Cold War, the insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is assigned by the Bar association to defend in court the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), who was captured by the FBI. Donovan is successful and Rudolf is sentenced to life imprisonment instead of death penalty. Meanwhile the American pilot and spy Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is arrested by the Soviet government while taking photos from a spy plane that crashed. The CIA summons Donovan to help in the negotiation to exchange the two spies. When Donovan learns that the American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) was arrested in the border of East Berlin while trying to bring his German girlfriend to the West Berlin, he decides to include the student in the negotiation. However his proposal is not supported by the CIA that is interested in Powers only. Further, Powers is prisoner of the soviet government and Pryor is prisoner of the GDR (German Democratic Republic). Will Donovan succeed in his intent?""Bridge of Spies"" is a great spy thriller based on a true story in the period of the Cold War. The plot is engaging and the cinematography, costume design and art direction are amazing. It is unnecessary to comment the direction of Steven Spielberg and the performance of Tom Hanks, perfect as usual, but it is impressive the capacity of negotiation of James B. Donovan. This American lawyer is shown as an impressive negotiator, having cold blood to make tough decisions. The credits informs that Donovan has been also successful negotiating later in Cuba the release of prisoners.

Great Performances and Good Drama,"Bridge of Spies (2015)*** (out of 4)Attorney James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is given the thankless job of defending suspected Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Donovan accepts the job but soon finds himself defending his client a bit too good for some, which leads to him being the main negotiator between America and Russia when it comes time for a prisoner swap.Steven Spielberg's BRIDGE OF SPIES isn't one of the director's greatest works but it's certainly a very well-made film that manages to hold your attention throughout the rather long running time. I must admit that the trailer for the film really left me cold so I wasn't sure what to expect from the film but overall it's another good movie from the director, although the ending falls into that cringe-worthy, over-sentimental stuff that the director does quite often.With that said, there's no doubt that there's a highly good story being told here that grabs your attention and doesn't let it go. The screenplay by Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman does a very good job at capturing the spirit of the period and even if you're not familiar with the Cold War the film does a nice job at bringing you up to speed on the various fears. Spielberg perfectly handles the material and milks it for some nice drama as well as some political points that are certainly meant to be taken into consideration on some current issues.Hanks, as you'd expect, turns in an excellent performance and is certainly believable in the role of the attorney who finds his life spinning out of control from not only his wife but strangers who feels he is helping a spy. Hanks is such a calm grace that it really was entertaining just seeing him negotiate. Rylance also deserves a lot of credit for the way he played this character and I really loved the laid back approach to where the character never tips his cap in regards to what and who he really is. Technically speaking the film is quite good and of high standards.BRIDGE OF SPIES could have been a bit tougher on the political aspects but it's goal was to aim for the mainstream and in the end it's an entertaining film.",,Anonymous,History
"Tense, Fresh, Even-Handed Perspective on Cold War Negotiations","Hanks and Spielberg tackle a Cold War spy-exchange against the backdrop of a freshly-constructed Berlin Wall. As one might expect from these old masters, it's expertly-crafted and loaded with gravitas; a warm, motivated take on a surprisingly under-explored chapter of recent history. It does a great job of delicately re-evaluating popular sentiment and the bullish nature of post-war international relations, too, painting heroes and victims on both sides of the dispute. The plot is very linear, though, moving on a predictable set of rails from start to finish, and that can make it feel preachy when a few of the more heavy-handed themes briefly overstay their welcome. A foundationally-strong, workmanlike offering, it's 50% desperately-uphill legal drama and 50% high stakes poker with a set of captive American souls as the ante.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Some good acting in an utterly disappointing movie,"Mark Rylance stands out as the best reason to watch this movie. And, I feel tempted to say, the only reason to do so. His lines take the cream of the screenplay. I am quite a fan of spy movies. That is exactly why I find this to be extremely disappointing as a movie. Seeing Steven Spielberg's name come up at the final credits was a sort of cherry on the funeral cake. The direction and the editing are the two most disappointing elements of this production. Then parts of the story. It is all so predictable, so cliché, so déjà-vu. I happened to watch this film in the weeks in which the BBC broadcast a brilliant 5-part series entitled ""London Spy"". That is everything a spy-film fan can wish for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is everything but that. Underwhelming at best...",7.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting Insight,"With the masterful Steven Spielberg behind the lens, this movie was destined to be amazing. Tom Hanks gave an incredible performance as the non-fictional character, James B. Donovan. I really enjoyed this film because of that aspect; that it really happened. It was such an eye opening film to a true story I never really knew about it. Hanks was an extremely powerful and convincing lawyer and it was very interesting to see how his mind worked when it came to dealing with the character Rudolf Abel, played by Mark Rylance. Rylance also delivered a wonderful performance. Overall, this film was an interesting insight to events during the Cold War and a story that definitely needed to be told.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Another masterpiece from the grand master.,"Well What can i say? Spielberg did it again! This is a film that has that instant feeling you just love it and you're watching something truly special. And its a true story, and i'm a sucker for true stories.The story its another great lesson to be learned by humanity, and the screenplay does an outstanding job telling it. It has all the ingredients Spielberg is known for, the hope in humanity, the believe in the mans power to change the course of history for the good, the true selfless, and so on.The cast is beyond perfect, and everyone gives amazing performances, but of course Tom Hanks steals the show, he gives one of his most likable performances, in the end the character helps a lot. Its just a bigger than life character which fits like a glove in Tom Hanks. The other characters are also amazing, but the one that stands the most to me, even if hes not the one to appear the most, is the Russian spy (Mark Rylance) hes just one of those characters that his so unique and likable that is amazing.The production values are just top notch as one would expect from a Spielberg film. The visuals are hauntingly beautiful and perfectly illustrate the feel of the cold war. The film is amazingly shot, there's a scene with an aircraft that is breathtaking. The special effects are perfect. The production design is bound to be nominated for an Oscar, special attention to the Berlin settings. The score is another hit for Thomas Newman, though the film has this amazing atmosphere were there's very little score and the one there is is mainly in the final minutes. This gives a very authentic and realistic feeling to the film, its like you are really rgere. Thats why i was surprised that the length of the score is almost 50 minutes!Overall the film has a lot in common with Lincoln, its really the perfect follower to that amazing picture. This is one of those films where you just get lost in the story, it's a very immersive film, a true masterpiece thats bound to get a ton of nominations from the academy.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Solid Cold War thriller, but a bit disappointing.","Spielberg, Hanks, Coen Brothers. Rarely have there been so many members of the Hollywood royal family working together on a single motion picture. With this calibre of talent involved the expectations are unsurprisingly sky high; unfortunately this Cold War true story lands in the 'good, but not good enough' category and subsequently feels like a missed opportunity. At first it's difficult to pinpoint why the spark is missing as all the ingredients for an old-school espionage yarn are present, but after careful contemplation it seems to me that Spielberg may be going through the motions. His direction is purposely understated to be sure, although there is a distinct lack of oomph in his narrative propulsion that is strangely un-Spielbergian. There's also never any real sense of Hanks' American attorney being in danger, despite spending large chunks of time in war-torn Berlin liaising with shadowy Russian diplomats and volatile German soldiers. Nevertheless, this thriller predominantly satisfies thanks to another heartfelt performance from main man Hanks. His put upon lawyer is righteous but grounded, intelligent but humble, fearful but optimistic, all with a welcome dash of wit. In fact it's the Brooklyn-set first act that proves the most entertaining, when it's mostly a two-hander between Hanks and Mark Rylance's dryly-humorous Russian spy, the latter damn near stealing the show right from under Hanks' nose. With regular Spielberg collaborator Janusz Kaminski on hand as director of photography, the movie looks utterly spectacular too, the glowing courtrooms of New York just as impressive as the snowy streets of a war-ravaged Germany. Bridge of Spies is a solid Cold War thriller with a compelling protagonist, yet with the Tinseltown heavyweights involved I can't help but think it's also somewhat of a disappointment.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Power of Being a Boy Scout,"Good guys DO sometimes win... We would like to believe this is true all the time. In the story presented so ably by Spielberg and the Cohen Brothers, and as acted in the Lead by Tom Hanks in this film, we can feel good that Right has might, and good guys can and DO win.2015 was an amazing year in American cinema - three of the finest films since 2000, 'A Bridge Of Spies', 'Spotlight', and 'Sicario' were released in the same year. Spotlight deserved its position as Best Film of the Year. But Bridge of Spies presented close competition - In terms of the ""feel good"" aspect, if there were an award for such, Bridge wins. The brilliant, gritty, and moody Sicario might be the best-ever film depicting the War on Drugs on and over our Southern border.With parameters of Academy Awards now ""conditional"" upon social justice messaging in 2023, a year like 2015 may be one of the last in the foreseeable future, where films shall be judged solely upon its art excellence by the Academy, something I didn't think ever necessary, as the freedom of speech and free choice has always been innately present in film art - does it really need oversight? Kind of defeats the ideals inherent in art imo.Regardless, Bridge is fabulous, one of Spielberg's best films, Hanks knocking it over the Berlin Wall and spellbinding acting by Mark Rylance who deserved his Supporting Actor statuette.HIGHLY recommended viewing!👍👍",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Watchable, forgettable, Hollywood caramelized drama","With all the power names in this film it has all the potential to be one of the greatest. And sadly, this watchable and reasonably entertaining film falls incredibly flat on many accounts if you're someone who uses your brain. When a film relies upon a character study and doesn't have lots of action, there needs to be a proper foundation to justify why characters act the way they do - and that clearly wasn't the case here. And the film's attempt to be clever outsmarts itself.In summary, Hanks plays an insurance defense lawyer. He's recruited to be the face of a defense for an alleged Russian spy. The full details of the spy are unfortunately just left for the viewers imagination. There is a complete lack of developing the character other than ""a dispassionate old guy who likes to paint and look like a nice old man"" that Tom Hanks finds his heart bleeding after a meeting. There seems no question that the man is guilty. But Tom Hanks decides to go all the way to defend this man and beyond, in spite of being demonized in public as the defender of a traitor. Things get complicated when a US pilot is captured in Russia and an innocent American student as well in Germany.The performances are excellent. There is some witty dialogue and some character study, unquestionably the unrivaled abilities of the Coen brothers. I found the first 1/3 of the film to be the most engaging, by far.But as much as I admire their work, this film has Spielberg shmaltz draped all over it. And this ultimately is what makes this film (a) totally predictable; and (b) overly dramatic to the point of groaning multiple times. I found myself drawn completely outside of the movie when it was clear that these actors were just caricatures and very shallow, cardboard cutouts. The film was cardboard, mostly telling a noble series of events without knowing very much at all about all of the players. There is precious little to understand the true motives of any of the characters. And then there will be repeated one-liners for laughs (I thought the characters would wink at the screen) and moments where you could practically hear the director call for the camera to pan out and admire the actor, transfixed in his expression which makes a bold, iconic statement. (Yeah, I'm guessing it all went down just like that, a dramatic artistic moment.)It's an entertaining film but make no mistake before you decided to go -- this has Hollywood draped all over what you would not expect from a Coen Brothers script. If you can shut down your brain and cheer for American patriotism, you'll very much enjoy the film. But if you're a thinking person who picks up on subtle cues, you may find this a very contrived and predictable work.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"A ""Lincoln""-like Examination of an Historical Event","Although this is an exceptional story that enjoys examining the minutia of the period, the story arc as a whole does not really offer anything new. This leaves the performances as the primary appeal for the film. Tom Hanks has proved himself as the Average Joe of this generation. Then again, I never felt he was really in peril at any point in the film, perhaps because of his role in Captain Phillips or even Saving Private Ryan. In those films he was an Average Joe who nevertheless had the courage to face violence when necessary. One of my favourite films with Tom Hanks starring is Road To Perdition. Because that was also a period piece, sometimes I felt I was watching the mafia character he portrayed. The most standout performance is Mark Rylance playing Abel, the Soviet spy caught in the U.S. He certainly could get an Oscar nod for a supporting actor.The story rolls along well enough, the longer length of the film comes from the fact that two stories are told. First is the capture and conviction of Abel in America. The second story follows the downing of Francis Powers and the setup of the exchange. I think some places to condense the exchange story could have brought the film back closer to a more appropriate two hours. Why? Well, I forgave Spielberg for the longer running time in Lincoln, because that film also had such a large cast to flesh out, and most of those characters were the real attraction in that film. Here, time is spent with Hanks visiting many East German characters that aren't particularly noteworthy, along with a few side trips that ultimately slow the momentum.One thing that has become annoying is the one-note style of cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. As usual, every scene has a washed out backlight. Spielberg is known for incorporating longer single-take shots that are well choreographed, traveling along with the momentum of the scene. Oddly, he is too constrained with that style, where I was hoping some dynamic camera-work would provide a unique perspective of some interesting locations. I can't say I totally disagree with that decision, other than when a dynamic shot occurs, such as one showing the sentencing of Francis Powers, it seems it is the only time the films shows any real visual energy. The music hits the right beats, but again, does not try to stand out in any way.I doubt general movie goers will embrace this movie. The subject matter will not really connect with anyone beyond those who enjoy period pieces like this. Hanks' character, unfortunately, has no Oscar moments to emote. The climax of the film also doesn't have any fireworks in the normal sense. I would recommend this film as a chance to get a glimpse of a piece of history you probably never knew before. But I would not really not call it one of the best films of the year, or a highlight of either Spielberg's or Hanks' career.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Those brought up on John Le Carré might perhaps expect from this moral equivalence, shabby compromise and exhausted futility. But Spielberg, with his gift for uncynicism, uncovers decency and moral courage amidst all the Realpolitik.

"Just Solid, Classic Spielberg","One of the most prolific directors in the history of cinema, Steven Spielberg, returns to the silver screen with his new period thriller ""Bridge of Spies"" starring two-time Academy Award winner Tom Hanks. It features competent and solid filmmaking from its director, writers, and crafts team however, the film doesn't quite ignite passion and excitement from its standard storytelling. What really manages to standout is the impeccable and sensational performance of Emmy Award nominee Mark Rylance, who steals and owns every scene he's present.The film tells the story of James Donovan (Hanks), an American lawyer that is recruited by the CIA during the Cold War to help rescue a pilot (Austin Stowell) detained in the Soviet Union. It all begins with the discovery of a probable spy on our own soil Rudolf Abel (Rylance), who tests Donovan's profession and safety net.Academy Award winner Steven Spielberg brings many of his signature techniques to the spy tale. Tugging at the emotional heartstrings is an Olympic event at this juncture in his career, although not exactly hitting the mark the way it was intended. He frames his scenes with the same familiar authority that we've grown to love about Spielberg, and it definitely exceeds some of his lesser works like ""War Horse"" and ""The Terminal."" What the film truly lacks is a daring approach to its source material. Unfamiliar with the story and real life individuals, Spielberg, and the writers, Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman, don't enter the grit and horror of two countries at a feud, literally on the brink of a real devastating war.Tom Hanks brings his natural charisma and wit that we've loved about him for decades. His James Donovan is caring, engaging, and reminiscent of Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird."" His devotion to his family and the human condition is truly admirable, all clear and on display thanks to Hanks. As Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance is just a joy to behold, filling in the gaps of the film's shortcomings with charm and seasoned acting ability. It's a brilliant turn by a brilliant actor. It's one of the year's best supporting turns and a contender for the Oscar statue.As James' wife Mary, Amy Ryan is relegated to just a few scenes but great nonetheless. Also brief are the works of Billy Magnussen and Alan Alda, who have good, solid one scenes to chew on.Technically the film does present qualms. Janusz Kaminski's camera work is distracting in parts, shining bright lights through windows, and keeping a one note camera style all throughout its 135 minute run time. Thomas Newman's score isn't put to its best use, as it swells in inopportune moments, even managing to overwhelm a key and fantastic scene by Rylance. Michael Kahn cuts the film to a bloated expansive run time but manages to keep you involved enough to make it through. The film really shines in its Production Design by Adam Stockhausen and its Costume work by Kasia Walicka-Maimone.""Bridge of Spies"" may find lovers in mass audiences. What it does well is ignite a curiosity and power to look at the history of its subject. Spielberg succeeds at introducing the world to James Donovan and what else he contributed to society, along with the supporting players at hand. We do wish that a better, more dynamic treatment had hit the screens. From an awards standpoint, it's going to appeal to a great deal. Perhaps a second viewing will open up more possibilities.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Disappointingly shallow and poorly acted out,"Hanks, Alda, Spielberg, the Coen brothers. What can go wrong? Apparently, quite a lot.Strengths first: the meticulous recreation of the 60's across two countries is breathtaking. The streets look 60's, the people look and talk 60's, the atmosphere is 60's. It's immersing and awe-inspiring.Now the weaknesses: 1) Lots and lots of exposition. I understand that the millenials are expected to not know the history from 50 years ago, but come on - if someone doesn't know/love history they aren't going to see this movie in the first place. Stop wasting our time with exposition. 2) Poor acting. This must be the weakest performance from Tom Hanks I've seen in years. The guy is sleep-walking through the role, and everyone else is wooden and not worth mentioning, except for Alan Alda who steals every scene he's in. Amy Ryan is just awful I'm sorry to say. 3) Too long. Way too long. Should've ended with the exchange taking place. We don't need the ""happy end"" through vindication - it's completely implausible too. 4) Not focused. The pilot's story is completely surplus to requirements and insignificant - it doesn't add anything to the narrative. We don't really need to see the pilot until his first scene in captivity. Instead, the time should be spent on character development of which there is absolutely none. 5) Predictable. Yes, the story is well known and we all know how it ends, but this means that the unpredictability needs to be in the nuances. The little things that aren't part of the written history. But everything is predictable, nothing is captivating. 6) The treatment of the story. The script is by the Coen brothers but it has John Le Carre written all over it. It's a classic Le Carre-like spy thriller (thriller, not action). There have been fantastic film adaptations of Le Carre, so we know it can be done. Sadly, on this occasion Spielberg fails to deliver.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,History

a must see for Cold War and post-Cold War generations alike,"I saw Bridge Of Spies with friends last night.

Every American, every citizen of the former East Germany and West Germany, every citizen of Russia or any former republic of the Soviet Union, such as Lithuania, Kyrgyzstan, Estonia; every citizen of a former Warsaw Pact country such as Romania, Poland, the former Czechoslovakia, Albania; MUST SEE this movie, especially those who weren't old enough during the Cold War. Life in our countries was very different during the Cold War. Many people, young and old alike, didn't live long enough to see the end of the Cold War, or the demolition of the Berlin Wall, because they were killed. Many families were separated or forced to relocate during the Cold War. Some of us served in the armed forces then and are known as ""Cold Warriors"". Some of these people might've been your relatives or friends of your family.The film depicts a part of the life and the negotiations of an American attorney during the Cold War and how tense things used to be.

Appreciated but not loved!,"Set in the Cold War era, in Brooklyn, Bridge of Spies is a story about a successful insurance prosecutor, James B Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is given a case to defend a Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). A true nationalist and yet an idealist lawyer, James draw a lot of flak from his men for his earnest and professional efforts in the case. But soon, his ideology leads him to a precarious task of rescuing an American pilot, a task gravely sensitive for the two conflicting nations. The movie is not a nail biting thriller which the title or the trailer or Saving Private Ryan might have suggested. This is a very evenly paced drama, predictable for most of the time but boasts of meticulous details, a hallmark of Mr Spielberg. The story is inherently a little weak, yet Mr Spielberg manages to spin off a decent movie out of it. James and Rudolf really hit it off and it is fun to watch them together. Tom Hanks is at his usual best and Mark Rylance befits the character of an extraordinarily wise, artistic and resolute Russian soldier. Other characters are not of much significance and a couple of them actually seem needless. The movie follows a depiction of the event as it happened and doesn't display any deliberate dramatization. Consequently, it doesn't evoke any strong emotions while watching which some people might actually prefer. Personally, I believe a better connect and impact would have made this movie far more memorable. This definitely is a decent, American film which scores completely on actors, cinematography (involving 1960 Brooklyn) and direction. But considering what Mr Spielberg and Mr Hanks have done before, I had stomach for more.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Easily one of Steven Spielberg's best films in recent years, this Cold War-era feel-good drama is a masterclass in old-fashioned Hollywood craftsmanship","Steven Spielberg's latest Cold War-era thriller begins with a near- wordless cat-and-mouse overture that reminds us how much of a craftsman he is. In that brilliant opening, we watch transfixed as FBI agents trail a suspected Soviet agent named Rudolf Abel through subways, sidewalks and parks of Brooklyn before finally raiding his apartment and arresting him on charges of treason and espionage. As much as you'd expect Spielberg to follow that up with screw- tightening suspense, he confounds that expectation just as quickly with a droll introduction to his lead protagonist named James Donovan, a New York insurance claims attorney arguing why the accident in which the client he is currently representing had hit a car with five people should not be referred to as ""five things"" but just ""one thing"".Sure enough, Spielberg doesn't try to do a Tom Clancy with this real-life story of how Donovan came to be appointed by the Bar to represent Abel and subsequently negotiated a tricky exchange of Soviet and American spies; instead, working with a brilliantly written script by Joel and Ethan Coen with Matt Charman that adapts freely from the historical record, Spielberg mounts a handsomely old-fashioned story of righteous underdog triumph. It is a feel-good drama in every sense of the word, one that not only celebrates Donovan's achievements but also honours the man for the principles of the U.S. Constitution for which he stood resolutely for, no matter how much others had already made up their mind about how the so-called American enemy should be treated.Unfolding in two quite distinct halves, the first sees Donovan giving Abel a stout defence despite the CIA's interference and presenting a compelling argument to the judge why his client should not be put to death, while setting up the circumstances by which Donovan will in fact be proved right. At what seems narratively the same time as the trial itself, the U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), selected as part of an elite group to take part in a top-secret mission to take highly detailed photographs of military installations within the Soviet Union, is captured by the Russians after his plane is shot down. It is not long after that the Berlin wall will be erected, which an American economics student named Richard Pryor (Will Rogers) finds himself on the wrong side of and detained by the East Germans.And so, in the second half, Donovan is recruited by the CIA to cut a deal with the Soviets that will see the former trade Abel for Powers' return – though Donovan decides on his own initiative to get two American men back for one Soviet spy. In contrast to the preceding half, this one is pretty much anchored through and through by Tom Hanks' Donovan, who makes multiple trips by himself across the Berlin Wall to negotiate separate deals with a top KGB agent on the return of Powers as well as a very Western East German lawyer named Vogel (Sebastian Koch) on Pryor's return. Donovan plays it cool in front of both the Soviets and the East Germans (what other choice does he have, really), but a scene where he is played by Vogel to be detained overnight by the East German police and another in which he watches East German refugees attempting to scale the wall being gunned down reinforces the peril within his lone-man mission as well as the complex geopolitical realities at play.There is no secret whether Donovan manages to navigate the potentially treacherous waters (pun intended) to secure both Powers' and Pryor's releases – yes, the history books will already have you know that it all culminates at the Glienicke Bridge linking West Berlin with Potsdam, from which the movie takes its name. Rather than playing up the facts of the case, Spielberg opts instead to focus on the unlikely American hero with the modesty, high principles and simple fairness who would – as a post-script informs – be called upon to play yet another instrumental role in the subsequent negotiation with Fidel Castro for the 'Bay of Pigs' invasion. Yet Spielberg doesn't over-emphasise these ideals to make Donovan any sort of an icon; rather, Donovan just does the right thing from moment to moment, with an uncanny ability of ""feeling"" the person at the other end of the negotiation.It is the sort of role that is perfectly suited for Hanks' Everyman charm, and the actor, here in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg, gets it down pat. Removing any hint of sanctimoniousness, Hanks puts on, on top of a warm and generous performance, an extra air of humanity to play the rookie who, though way out of his depth in the rough and murky waters of espionage, follows a clear conscience and abiding values to emerge as an admirable hero. Hanks makes it all seem so natural, but lest we take it for granted, it does require a formidable actor to play the ordinary Capra-esque hero with a dry humour and much intellect to bear. And at least for a good third of the film, Hanks is well-matched with veteran stage actor Rylance, whose understated performance as Abel is a masterclass in itself.Indeed, there is never any doubt at any point in the film that we are amongst seasoned pros – besides Hanks and Spielberg, the latter's long-time collaborator Janusz Kaminski on camera who achieves a thick and luxurious atmosphere with his choice of shots and colour palette. This is as assured and confident Hollywood filmmaking as it gets, whether as a gripping fact-based docudrama or as a detailed character study or even as a sober lesson on tradecraft, political ideals and personal values. It is also Spielberg's best film in years, one that should and would see some deserved Oscar attention come next year.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting but clumsy and a tad idealistic,"Interesting but clumsy and a tad idealistic.A European man living in the US, Rudolph Abel, is arrested as a Russian spy. An American lawyer, James Donovan, takes on his case but, faced with overwhelming evidence and a biased judge, loses the case. Abel is sentenced to 30 years in jail and Donovan's Supreme Court appeal fails. Just then Francis Gary Powers, the ""U-2 Spy"", is shot down over Russia and captured. Now Donovan becomes the negotiator in a potential prisoner swap...Interesting story, especially as it is largely true and involves a very well-known historic event - the U-2 Spy. The negotiations and brinkmanship towards the end are quite intriguing.However, feels clumsy, idealistic and, at times, contrived. The first part of the movie deals very heavy-handedly with Abel's trial. The character of Donovan also seems too goody-two-shoesy to be the real Donovan.Certainly not Steven Spielberg's best direction - far from it. The movie seems to lack engagement and what there is is overly contrived and sentimental. Plus I quite quickly got irritated with his over- use of the last image of one scene being a segue to a new, unrelated, scene. Just felt very cheesy and amateurish.Being a Steven Spielberg film, we have Tom Hanks in the lead role. He puts in a fairly solid performance. Mark Rylance got a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his performance as Abel. Not sure why - he doesn't have that much dialogue and his screen time is fairly limited too.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Cold-War Chess Match as Suspenseful as Any Thriller in Spielberg/Cohen Broithers  Masterpiece,"For over a half-century after the Second World War, from circa 1945 to 1990, the United States was involved in a ""war"" of sorts with the USSR we call the ""Cold War"". Barring the USSR's military engagements, such as in Afghanistan and other border countries, few died on other side as a result of this Cold War (and spy thriller novelists made a fortune). The Cold War was a continual chess match of adversarial confrontation and tension between the two world super-powers and their respective allies, notably the USSR and their eastern bloc allies of the Warsaw Pact and the United States and their NATO Allies of the North Atlantic Treaty. Non-violent conflicts were nearly never-ending, their chess pieces involving spies, intelligence, and espionage, each side trying desperately to gain the upper hand over their respective adversary, constantly moving their pieces to different areas of the board. When the two sides came to secret negotiating tables, they engaged the game like poker players, holding their cards close to their chests, neither side revealing any more about their hands than absolutely necessary. ""Bridge of Spies"" written by the Cohen Brothers with Matt Charman and directed by Steven Spielberg, chronicles one such as ""game"".Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance, in an Academy-Award caliber performance), a.k.a. Vilyam ""Willie"" Genrikhovich Fisher, was an older unassuming man in a small Brooklyn apartment appearing to engage in painting projects. While under the guise of a painter, Abel was passing military secrets to Soviet agents. His cover was blown in 1957 when CIA agents raided his apartment and arrested him on charges of espionage and spying for the USSR. The US government appeals to Abel for help in their intelligence gathering in exchange for his release, but Abel declines.James Donovan (Tom Hanks), a former Nuremberg Trial associate prosecutor, is working as an insurance-claim lawyer in a New York firm. His firm asks him to defend Abel as a publicity gesture to prove the US engages in fair trails, even for those who are charged with the highest-level crimes against the United States. (The film makes it seem like he was an associate attorney forced by his firm to take the case, although at the time, Donovan was in fact a senior partner of his firm Watters and Donovan.) Donovan reluctant agrees to take the case.The respective lawyers, prosecutor and defender, meet with the trail judge who explains the trail is only for ""show"" to publicly send a message to the USSR and the world at large that the US Justice Department treats all defendants fairly and impartially, even with those accused of the most heinous of crimes against the state. However, behind closed doors, the judge indicates the verdict is a foregone conclusion. Donovan, who desires to be true to his case and his client disagrees, stating the trial should be taken seriously and not act only as a kind of international publicity stunt. Donovan then meets with his client where a mutual understanding is exchanged in which Abel makes clear he has no intention of cooperating with US intelligence authorities.At first Donovan is perturbed at his client's reluctance to aid the CIA as it could mean the death penalty for Abel. However, as their attorney-client relationship evolves, Donovan begins to have respect for Abel. Abel was engaging in activities which other men in service to the United States are doing to the other side. In a profound statement, Abel says to Donovan that he hopes an American spy caught on the other side will also not be mistreated. In the only part of the film which was a bit weak, details of the actual trial are glossed over before Abel's inevitable conviction. In a surprising turn, the judge does not give Abel the death penalty but rather sentences him to a long prison term.In a different storyline, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is a US fighter pilot recruited by the CIA to engage in intelligence gathering. Scenes between the Abel case and Powers interweave and we learn about the recruitment and training process for pilots who have been drafted into the Cold War conflict. They are now expendable chess pieces in the larger game. They learn about their equipment and their undercover tasks which is so secret they are forbidden even to tell All-Mighty God about their endeavors. At first, Powers' story seems to have little to do with the Abel case, except Powers and Abel are both intelligence-gatherers for the different sides of the Cold War. However, as events play out, the two men's destinies will become intertwined. Eventually, Donovan will be traveling to Berlin where he'll see first-hand the creation of the infamous Berlin Wall.An absolutely riveting and edge-of-your seat Cold War story. While there are no car chases and no gun-fire exchanges, the story is as compelling and suspenseful as any by Spielberg and the Cohen brothers. They are masters of the well-paced scene in which we the audience are never sure how the events will resolve. Even during the final climactic event of the film, which is largely understated, not much actually happens, but our anticipation of what might and might not occur keeps us glued to every gesture and expression. This is one of the best directorial offerings by Spielberg since ""Lincoln"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the most riveting by the Cohen Brothers since ""No Country for Old Men"". Not to be missed, but it should be noted if you're looking for an action and suspense film similar to a Bond or Le Carre offering, ""Bridge of Spies"" is not that kind of story.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Mr Smith goes to a bridge,"I am a Cold War child, born in a country which did have common borders with a Warsaw Pact member but was never a target of thermonuclear destruction. I was still at primary school when I came across a couple of serialized excerpts from Powers' memoir. He really caught my imagination. I saw ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" and ""Across the Bridge"" (with Rod Steiger), films in which the bridge is both the passage and the frontier, a no-man's land in which destinies can be decided in a split second of hesitation or bad luck.Bridge of Spies was a great disappointment. Cars and costumes were fine but the spirit and the people of the era was absent. I don't understand why, when I think of ""Munich"" or ""Schindler's List"", when there are so many novels to consult for the atmosphere and so many memoirs to consult for the facts. Why was Powers pictured with such unkind shallowness? Why were CIA men and DDR functionaries such caricatures? No matter how great Mark Rylance was, where was the motivation and the ideology of the Soviet spy? Where were the political leaders of the two superpowers? How did the little lawyer from the Bronx become such a cool operative behind the lines, from one day to the other, without experiencing any fear or trepidation?There is nothing wrong with high morals or nostalgia in cinema but when a film tries to portray an episode from a complex political and ideological conflict serving only these ingredients, then I can only be disappointed at the waste of means and opportunities.

Bond of men in the coldest of times,"Capturing the weight and gloom of an era, Bridge of Spies is equally a biopic and an unexpected light drama. There's a lingering intensity, especially concerning the world of secrecy, yet it's a fascinatingly accessible story with subtle refined humor. This is meant to inspire instead of evaluation of ideologies, showcasing that humanity still resides beyond the other side of border or wall.Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is an alleged Soviet spy, he's caught and set for a trial. For his defense James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is unceremoniously selected, mainly for the purpose of procedure. After a while Donovan becomes invested on defending his client despite the unusual circumstance, it then takes him on a journey to help CIA save their own agent.Despite the rather shady title, this is not the flamboyant gunslinger action ala James Bond or the intense operation like Argo. It is, strangely and also effectively, a light foray into the otherwise dark world of espionage. The pace is utterly calm, credit goes to Mark Rylance as Abel, who occasionally shows the pettiness of worrying.He and Tom Hanks have incredible chemistry, both of the characters practically have nothing in common aside from the mutual respect towards each other. Donovan himself is avid negotiator, he pushes his objective with verbal aggression, yet the movie almost never resorts to violence and even on few occasions that it does venture to bleak territory, it does so with sophistication.Rather than using typical war buildup, the movie gives faces to each party, thus humanizing them in incredibly identifiable way. It also deals with the issues of the era head-on while maintaining composure and suspending judgment. Lastly, it offers a soft touch of comedy along the way. The unexpected banters lighten the mood with timely cynical quip, it doesn't undermine the theme and still gives polished interaction between the supposed stoic personalities.Bridge of Spies is perhaps one of the most accessible depictions of a war. It might set in Cold War and showcase the grim reality of it, yet it never falters on presenting honor, duty and the best side of humanity in less than favorable time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Historically Accurate Cold War Thriller!,"After a long time, I was able to see and witness a captivating prisoner swap drama sequel from the declassified archives of American CIA.Steven Spielberg is all praise for his professionally meticulous direction, perfectly taking the audience to the austere world of late 50s, when the Cold War was taking its surreptitious twists and turns. All the set frames including location shooting in Germany and USA were too close to reality. The entire story, script, screenplay and dialogs were so well fed and uttered with skillful craftiness by Hanks and the soviet convict spy played by Rylance, which made viable sense and were bred with the thrill that ensures the viewer to stick to the end.It is a must see spy thriller for mature audience taking them back in time to all those moments of glory unfold from enigmatic and suggestively nerve raking espionage taking place in the classic world of late 50s. Well done Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance for superb characterization of their respective roles, skillful film editing by Michael Kahn and top of the line direction by the old timer - Steven Spielberg.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Spielberg and Hanks deliver, but it's Rylance who steals the movie","""This man, my father's friend, he was beaten. Every time they hit him, he stood back up again. They hit him harder, still he got back to his feet. I think because of this they let him live.""Over the past few years Steven Spielberg has shied away from the big blockbuster productions and settled for historical dramas such as Lincoln, War Horse, and Munich. Now we can add Bridge of Spies to Spielberg's list of history lessons which counts on some outstanding and understated performances from an A list cast. This is the fourth collaboration between Spielberg and Tom Hanks, and although it doesn't rank amongst my favorite I still enjoyed the character he plays here. Hanks is James B. Donovan, an insurance attorney with a strong sense of justice who also happens to be a respectable family man. Hanks plays the character very subtly and in a way he reminded me of Gregory Peck's Atticus Finch because both characters seem to share a strong moral code and they put their sense of justice above what the community might think of them. Here Donovan is given the task to serve as a defense attorney for a KGB intelligence officer named Rudolf Abel (played masterfully by Mark Rylance) during the height of the Cold War. You can imagine how the public reacts when Donovan begins to take his role seriously and defends this spy. It takes a toll on his family as well, his wife is played here by Amy Ryan and his children by Jillian Lebling, Noah Schnapps, and Eve Hewson. They believe in him, but also seem to be going through a similar conflict. My complaint here is that Amy Ryan is sidelined and doesn't get to play an important role in the movie.There is also a parallel story going on as several US pilots are being recruited on a special mission to secretly fly U2 planes over the Soviet Union to gather intel. One of these pilots is Francis Powers (Austin Stowell) who on his first mission is shot down and captured by the soviets. The two plots come together when Donovan is asked by US government officials to try to negotiate a deal to interchange their prisoners. Spielberg delivers a historical piece with precise attention to detail giving us once again another important lesson about humanity's unsung heroes. Donovan represents the ideal character here with strong moral values that are often forgotten or overlooked in today's movie. I couldn't think of a better actor to play such a character than the great Tom Hanks. However the standout for me was Mark Rylance as the soviet spy. It was a breath of fresh air to see a character like this portrayed in such a humane light. He is not the enemy here, he is a man who is doing his job and also seems to share a strong moral code. Rylance gives the film's best performance and I think he out shined everyone in this film. The great Alan Alda also gets to be on screen for a few minutes although he isn't playing against type or anything like that.Political thrillers are rarely in my interest, but I couldn't let this film pass me by considering Steven Spielberg is the director who has made more of my favorite films than any other. Include a screenplay co-written with the Coen brothers and I was sold. The pacing of the film at times did seem to drag the movie down, but Spielberg treats the material with respect. Kaminski's cinematography captures the era perfectly and Newman's score adds to the emotional moments. The 50's are perfectly captured through the art direction and Spielberg managed to transport us back to Berlin during the construction of the wall. Overall I enjoyed my history lesson once again from Steven Spielberg, but I felt that the film could've benefited from more thrills and a better pacing. It's still a must see in my book.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Excellent and often very absorbing film, without being one of Spielberg's finest","'Bridge of Spies' had much going for it, mainly that it's based on a very interesting story, Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance are talented actors with some very noteworthy performances and when in his prime Steven Spielberg directed some of the most relentlessly entertaining and entertaining films in cinema.While 'Bridge of Spies' is not one of Spielberg's finest films, in the way 'Schindler's List', 'Jaws', 'ET', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'Empire of the Sun', 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'Jurassic Park' are, for me despite its flaws along with 'Lincoln' and 'War Horse' (remember liking 'Munich' a lot too, though it needs a re-watch) it's one of his better ones since 'AI'.There is not an awful lot wrong with 'Bridge of Spies', though due to the subject matter it's not going to appeal to all tastebuds. To me, it's biggest problem was pacing. By all means not a continuous problem, because there was enough in the film that was really engaging, but parts do drag and not every scene felt like it was needed. The beginning is notably draggy and the film could easily have ended after the climactic scene on the bridge, because the ending did feel unnecessarily stretched and was particularly guilty of the sappiness and over-sentimentality that Spielberg is often criticised for. Similarly Donovan's family scenes could have been excised with no problem, they add very little and their cloying nature did feel too much and misplaced within the rest of the film. The only other problem was Thomas Newman's score, it's nicely composed and it fits at least (to have it used sparingly was also a good move in order to not distract from the atmosphere and dialogue) but there is nothing hugely memorable or anything to go wow over or that evokes any strong emotions. Not bad as such, just bland.However, 'Bridge of Spies', as always with Spielberg is incredibly well-made, as well as directed with a lot of class. It is sumptuously shot and the period detail is elegant, atmospheric and positively eye catching, especially the scenes in Berlin where you actually feel the cold, austerity and tension. While there is a lot of talk in 'Bridge of Spies', the script is thought-provoking and tightly structured, not making the mistake of being rambling, using complicated jargon or being too wordy. There is even some nice knowing witty humour that gives the film some freshness and is well-incorporated when it appears, while the political and patriotic elements avoid being preachy. While the pace is not completely secure and not every scene felt necessary, the story is very absorbing and is told with intelligence, tension and emotion. While there is perhaps not enough on the trial, that part is very intriguingly done, while the Berlin scenes that dominate the film have a lot of tension and suspense. The shift from America to Berlin is handled well and not too crudely, a very easy thing to do when visually and atmospherically their scenes are so different.The characters are engagingly written on the most part, with the exception of Donovan's family (his wife in particular is the typical nurturing but frustrated cliché with little variation on it). Donovan is one of those characters that holds the narrative together as strong as a rock and is easily rootable, while Abel comes close to being the most sympathetic character while at the same time evoking some chills. The chemistry between the two characters is very strongly done. All the acting is very good (though Amy Ryan barely registers in the role that gives her very little to work with), with Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance being outstanding. Hanks is effortlessly commanding and has such a great cool charisma, essential for a lead role that is on screen for almost the whole duration. Despite his screen time being much less, Rylance portrays Abel with quiet understated dignity, with his expressions and eyes speaking every bit as much as when he's delivering his lines, that comes over both chillingly and heart-wrenchingly.All in all, excellent and often very absorbing. 7.5/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,History
Getting across the wall,"Bridge of Spies is a pedestrian cold war drama that combines the talents of Steven Spielberg and the Coen brothers. It really is a literal title as the climax takes place on a bridge and it has spies.Tom Hanks plays an insurance lawyer. We are meant to root for him even though as he tries to stiff a personal injury lawyer. Remember folks, his insured driver injured five people but he wants to limit it as one claim.Hanks really has the hang of these types of characters now, sturdy, steady, steadfast with just a hint of overacting. He plays James Donovan who is called in to defend Rudolf Abel a captured KGB spy operating in the USA. He places his life at risk to save him from the death penalty, being astute enough to realise that Abel may become useful in later years. So it does when the Russians capture a U-2 spy plane pilot. Donovan then has to put his personal safety at risk by going to East Germany to negotiate a spy swap.The film features a critically acclaimed performance from Mark Rylance who plays Abel and won a best supporting actor Oscar. Rylance is an example of a subtle, understated performance.Spielberg is a master craftsman but the film is just too cumbersome and stuffy. It never has the labyrinthic thrills of a John Le Carre story. There is some wonderful art direction but the film really needed some zap.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Finally a Cold War Film!,"Yes. I am a Cold War history buff and I am so glad someone finally made a Cold War film! Even better Tom Hanks stars in this excellent film. I love war films, but I find they usually get low ratings (like War Horse). This movie is a must see for anyone who enjoys good espionage films. I have to finally give a thumbs up to Spielberg for making a family friendly film (with the exception of some curse words which can be bleeped out).This is a must see movie! It's gripping and wonderful. I love how Spielberg portrays the Cold War era without making it to risky for those who still remember it. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job in the lead role. This is definitely one of his better roles and one that he will be remembered for.

A bit long but recommendable,"Not my type of movies, but I liked the cinematography, story and the directing. Of course, who am I not to like Spilberg's movies? Tom Hanks is a stand alone, Oscar worthy element in the film and has not been nominated even. What will make me wonder for a while is how on earth did Mark Rylance win an Oscar as an actor in supporting role for this particular movie, and Tom Hanks was not even nominated? Yet again, to date I don't understand how Emily Blunt was not nominated as a best actress for The Girl on the Train... I will never understand how the Globes and Oscars committee work to give the credits.

Missing something,"It was opening night, the theater was packed and I was expecting greatness. After all, this story is right in Spielberg's wheelhouse. The time period, cold war, Tom Hanks, the stars were aligned. I will start with this notion, Spielberg's movies are always well acted, always well shot and always beautifully scored. Bridge of Spies does not fail this standard. There are clearly some remarkable acting performances. It wouldn't be a surprise to see some trophies handed out for this work. The director got what he needed, superb acting. The actors did not get what they need, superb story telling. It is the only thing missing here but it's a biggie.If you know anything about the real life story of James Donovan you could easily imagine a truly exciting movie. The opening credit sequence included this line...Based on Real Events. This disclaimer gives license to the director to ""Hollywood up"" the story. So basically there are no excuses. In Munich, the director pealed your sole with great story telling, tension and acting. Bridge of Spies had that potential, at least, that's what I was expecting. Tension was left out of this movie for some reason. I theorize Spielberg did this intensionally. Why? Somebody should ask him.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Spielberg's greatest feat in some time, a masterclass of direction","Like the master-craftsman of his art that he is, Steven Spielberg just keeps on producing the goods. Sure his films may include the likes of 1942 and the last misguided Indiana Jones movie outing, but for someone that's directed 31 feature films its incredible there's not an absolute stinker in a career that's spaned in excess of 50 years. Where Bridge of Spies might rank among the bearded hat wearing gurus career however can only be decided by time but there's little doubt this cold war thriller is an absolute treat of cinematic produce.Tense, taut and most tellingly, meticulously shot and edited, Spies is quite possibly Spielberg's finest film in a decade.Working with his usual and trusted production crew including D.O.P Janusz Kaminski and editor Michael Kahn (sadly John Williams doesn't score Spies, perhaps he was busy in a galaxy far far away?), Spies really does see Spielberg achieve fantastic overall results, especially from his team up with writers Joel and Ethan Coen who were bought in to touch up Matt Charman's original script.While it's not got the heart of Spielberg's most revered films like E.T, Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan or the pure spectacle of ventures like Jaws or Minority Report, it's still clear Spielberg had a blast creating this thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat almost entirely through its scripting and construction. Spies in many ways feels cut from the same cloth as Spielberg's Munich, just much more tightly focused.In recent times Spielberg may've achieved good if not stunning outcomes in tales like Lincoln and War Horse but Spies is just a purely unbridled joy led by yet another great Spielberg directed performance of Tom Hanks.Himself experiencing good not incredible films of recent times, Spies allows Hanks to once more display the everyman American that's driven his career and his hardworking lawyer that really just wants a good night's sleep, James B. Donovan, will here go down as one of his all times best.His the star of the ensemble, Spielberg allowing him a showing in almost every scene and Hanks nails it. Delivering just like the film around him does, seemingly with the ease of the ticking of a clocks second hand.Put simply, a near faultless production that lacks ever so slightly some true emotional punches or set pieces that would've made it a 5 star masterpiece, Bridge of Spies is yet again further reminder to all as to why Spielberg is the true movie making king and this is a film that will likely see him and his crew seriously contend at the next Oscar ceremony.Bridge of Spies is without question a definite much watch for all cinema lovers.4 ½ American breakfast's out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Constitution and the Cold War,"During the Cold War, an American lawyer (Tom Hanks) is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.The film is nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (for Rylance), Best Production Design and Best Original Screenplay. Let us address those in reverse order.There is no doubt the screenplay is strong, and another feather in the caps of the Coen brothers. Whether or not you consider it to be ""best"" probably comes down to one thing: do you prefer a good story or do you prefer historical accuracy? If you prefer historical accuracy, you are going to have qualms with this picture because Donovan (Hanks) is very false. He is portrayed as an insurance attorney rather than the intelligence operative he was, and he is shown as the victim of multiple acts of violence, which he was not. So that will be an automatic hangup for some people who frown on dramatic exaggeration and poetic license.If one looks at it a bit more forgivingly, though, it is an incredible script that covers the Constitution, the Cold War, the interaction of various governments and their agents... it tells the story of one attorney defending a despicable client because it is the right thing to do (a la ""To Kill a Mockingbird"") and the better-known tale of Gary Powers and the U-2 spy plane. Is it sensationalized? Somewhat. A little melodramatic with its patriotism? Yes. But still a darn fine story, and whether a winner or not, clearly a strong contender for best screenplay.How about production design? This one is a bit of a challenge. The work that went into this film is incredible, bringing everything on screen back to the 1950s and 1960s. Every car, every outfit, and even the most inconsequential detail had to be touched. How you compare this to the futuristic sets of ""Mad Max"" or the science-driven world of ""The Martian"", who knows? It is like comparing apples and oranges. While ""Bridge of Spies"" will probably not carry this category, those who worked on securing all the necessary scenery deserve top honors.The supporting actor category is where ""Bridge of Spies"" has its best chance of winning an award. Mark Rylance is not an actor whose work I am familiar with, because he has primarily distinguished himself on the stage. So it is hard to say how much he is going outside of his normal range here. But he gives us an interesting character. While ""best actors"" are often intense or pushed to their limits, Rylance is quite the opposite: subtle and understated. But it makes fora powerful, compelling nemesis you cannot help but like in some way. He would be deserving of the award.Which leaves us with best picture. And the short answer is no, this is not a contender. The nomination makes sense, but the film never seems to hit all cylinders. Although nothing is lacking, it still feels somehow incomplete. ""Bridge of Spies"" is not the film of the year, nor is it among Spielberg's best.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Everything you'd expect from Spielberg,"It has been a while since we have been blessed with something from the legendary Steven Spielberg and Bridge of Spies certainly does not disappoint. I do not think this is one of Spielberg's greatest films (It's kind of hard to become of those), however I do believer this film is surely high on the list. Bridge of Spies brings light on the Cold War, an event that most audiences do not know much about. The Cold War did not have much action associated with it and neither does Bridge of Spies. Nonetheless, this film was highly entertaining and had me glued to my seat. Everything flowed together perfectly. These days actors are perform at a high level and most films have moving performances from everyone they cast. Bridges of Spies was no exception to this. Tom Hanks has yet to let me down in a film and Mark Rylance looks like he needs to be cast in a lot more films. The only thing negative I have to say about the film is that it is very predictable.

The Bridge over the Torn Curtain...,"In the midst of the Cold War paranoia, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) a lawyer specialized in insurance settlement is assigned to defend KGB spy Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance in a performance that will deserve a few words. This is less a trial than a tactic to prevent the Soviet Union to politically exploit Abel's arrest: Abel's case must show the world that USA treated him democratically. But that's only a cover, what Donovan ignores. Like so many characters who populated Hanks' filmography, Donovan is a decent man and much more, a professional. He takes his job seriously and when he discovers that much of the evidence was found without search warrants, he even wants to call a vice of form.So, what we get is a highly respected lawyer, with an Irish name, a respectable family, and a 'Red' who might have pulled a Rozenberg in his actions and be the cause of New York's imminent nuking, in the minds of millions of Americans or kids, constantly brainwashed by these Nuclear mushroom images (you know these 'duck and cover' programs). Naturally, Abel's public image inevitably spills over Donovan who worries everyone from his family to his colleagues, from the prosecutors to the judge, and his zeal doesn't help. That, alone, would have been the premise of a terrific movie, the contradiction of a man who does his job, out of decency and patriotism and is almost treated like a traitor. To think that there were supposed to counter-attack the Russian propaganda is one of these film's many subtle delights and it doesn't come as a surprise, that within this whole paranoid craze, you have these two men who seem to speak the same language.It is not a friendship in the cinematic sense of the word, but it's a story of respect between two men who know the context they live in, their duty, their limitations, but still, find a 'bridge' of communication, through such simple matters as honor, principles and humanity. Rylance's performance looks like a one-note one, but don't get mislead, this is a man who was trained not to show any emotions, to keep a low-profile, so it's only through his eye-language, and a few words, that you can get to the core of his feelings. He says he's not afraid of the electric chair, but his stoicism is later counterbalanced by the 'although it wouldn't be my first choice'. This is not some robotic spy, this is a human being who's also caught in the requirements of his job. And his attitude, if not the public's, earns him Donovan's everlasting sympathy.Tom Hanks, as usual, doesn't need to speak loudly his emotions, we can see that from the way he exchanges looks with Rylance, and after Abel's sentence, he pleads to Supreme Court arguing that there's no way, the USA should treat dishonorably a man who's only following a fighter's code the same way that America wished his men would follow the Constitution. There has to be a reciprocity of actions and treatments, not just in the weapon department. And what could have been a terrific climactic speech is only the precursor of the second act of the movie. Of course, there was no way, Abel would be found innocent, he wasn't anyway, so the film had to move to higher levels, and it does.It's interesting that Donovan worked in insurance, this is a man who made a living out of predicting odds, and in 1957, it didn't take the highest insurance exec to guess one American spy might be arrested once, and Abel could be used as a bargaining chip. His eloquence convinces the judge and Abel escapes from the Rozenberg treatment, and of course, it pays off, as a spy pilot, Gary Michael Powers, is shut down while traveling above the Soviet territory on U-21 plane. Donovan is then entrusted to negotiate the exchange of prisoners, which would've been a formality if it wasn't for a little twist: the arrest of an American student in Berlin while attempting to get his girlfriend to the West Side. When Donovan learns about this arrest, he can't imagine going back to America with only one person. The film turns into a very interesting chess game where Donovan must hit two birds with one stone, he must convince the Soviet and the East-German representatives, understand their motives, express his, and make the timing his ally, rather than an obstacle. It's a heart-pounding race against the clock.Although Steven Spielberg isn't renowned for being the most subtle director when it comes to emotions, his recent ""Lincoln"" was a signal that the tone of his movies abandoned their usual sentimentalism to some more mature material. Lincoln was less the noble-hearted hero than a positively Machiavellian tactician, and this is what Donovan is. And he plays the diplomatic game perfectly, learning how to be mild-mannered or firmly resolved, in the middle of a Cold War that wasn't just symbolically cold. This leads to a wonderful climax, whose first element of surprise is to reveal that the film's title wasn't just a metaphor.Now, I read many comments accusing the film of being another propaganda movie. I would say it's more of Capra-like movie in its spirit. Besides, wasn't Abel the most fascinating character of the movie, and a hero to some extent? Weren't the Americans as eager to hang Abel as a Western mob to lynch a cattle thief, and didn't one of the CIA guys even care of the American student? In fact, ""Bridge of Spies"" is beyond these considerations, it is less a thriller with two antagonistic sides, than a great character study with two similar men united by their patriotism and their sense of duty. And no matter how different the lifestyles are, two systems making such men possible can't be that bad.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks strikes again with the fantastic political-legal thriller, Bridge of Spies","As a child who grew up during the late nineties through the mid 2000's, I was part of the first generation to be raised in an era where there wasn't a second great power on Earth. Being born in 1987, I was living within the Cold War for only a few years, during the last moments of an interesting generation for America; a generation that once thought that a third World War with the Soviets was possible and that any day could be the last before the bomb was dropped. It was the last of an era were today's movie perfectly says was a war of information.Given how many WWII movies are out there, I'm surprised that nostalgia and our obsession with history has not produced more movies about the Cold War. Though there are plenty before the Soviet Union was dissolved (Including Dr. Strangelove, Rocky IV and my favorite of the bunch, WarGames), you'd think that more stories about the era would have opened up allowing for plenty of entertaining options. Steven Spielberg is a director that has tackled WWII plenty of times (1941, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan), so Bridge of Spies should seem like a literal and figurative bridge to connect that transition.In 1957 Brooklyn, a middle-aged painter Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) is seen picking up a secret message and reads it before FBI agents burst into his apartment. He's arrested and prosecuted as a Soviet spy, sparking a media and public demand for his death. As per rule by the court, Rudolf is given a lawyer for his defense, which turns out to be James B. Donovan (played by Tom Hanks). The interesting thing is that James is an insurance lawyer with little experience in criminal law, but takes the case anyway to show that he's loyal to his profession.James receive hate mail and accusations from people, his own children and even get's approached by the CIA, but stands on his ground that he's simply doing his job, helping the soviet spy. Though Rudolf is found guilty, James convinces the judge the give a jail sentence rather then death in case of needed collateral. That moment comes soon enough when CIA agent Francis Gary Powers is shot down and jailed by the Soviets. Both governments agree to an exchange, but not only does James actually have to go to East Germany to negotiate the deal, but when another American is jailed, he tries to get a two for one prisoner.Steven Spielberg has a track record that's easy to rely to when defending his movies, yet I wasn't sure how I'd respond to the political-legal thriller that Bridge of Spies is. I'm proud to say that it s engaging in a most unexpected way. While the subject doesn't seem too remarkable, once you get to know both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance's (who I hope gets an awards nomination for his portrayal) character, you get a good idea of what both sides are hoping to achieve, both as a stance on what it means to be loyal to your country and doing what's right.Aside from being a strong character piece, Bridge of Spies has a different look then you might expect from the more whimsical Spielberg. This fits right along his darker material as most of the movie is shown is greyer tones and surprisingly gets greyer once the story shifts to East Germany. With that said, the recreation of a Cold War Berlin looks great, especially when you see Tom Hanks riding the train to the other side where the wall shows what the difference is in one moment (which I won't give away).I'll give this ten cold war posters out of ten. Bridge of Spies is guaranteed one of my favorite movies of 2015 and deserves at least one watch from not just cold war fanatics or even history fanatics, but from the mainstream crowd. Bridge of Spies will get least start one conversation going once the end credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The Spy Who Went Into the Cold,"(Rating: ☆☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is highly recommended.In brief: A riveting docudrama with Spielberg and Hanks at the top of their gameGRADE: A-Bridge of Spies is a true Cold War tale about the espionage business, its unethical surveillance methods, and the ongoing political war games orchestrated between powerful nations. The film does shamelessly manipulate the emotions of its audience and, at times, lets the nostalgia wash over its subject matter depicting more innocent times than in actuality, but, in the capable hands of Steven Spielberg, this is superb filmmaking and one of the year's best. ￼The director's masterful handling of this complex story impresses in its concise storytelling and richly drawn characters. The screenplay by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers builds its narrative convincingly and clearly lays its background exposition through its compelling dialog that not only establishes the characters and their motives but moves the action at a steady pace.The year is 1957 when the United States and Russia were major enemies and spies worked undercover in search of oneupmanship. (Some things never change.) Back then, the world was splintering into different political factions, the military industrial complex was expanding, the threat of nuclear retaliation was a common practice, and the Berlin Wall became a reality. (A few do.)￼Into this quagmire is yet another political incident involving a convicted Russian spy named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) and an imprisoned American, Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a pilot caught behind enemy lines. One man, a lawyer named James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is asked to act as a go-between and secretly negotiate their exchange. The film chronicles these events with authenticity and high drama.The acting is excellent and the film is very well cast. Mr. Hanks has played the similarly upright decent common man role before but he continually impresses with his restraint and understatement of a man with a moral code that will not waiver. The actor never allows his character to overplay the righteousness and make Donovan more complicated by his subtle acting choices. Mr. Rylance has the more showier role as Abel and he brings a sly and layered portrait of a man who seems to enjoy being the pawn in this chess match. Other standouts include Alan Alda as one of Donavan's associates, Dakin Matthews as a very biased judge, Jon Curry and Michael Gaston as determined CIA agents, Will Rogers as as idealistic college student caught in the cloak-and-dagger web of intrigue, and Amy Ryan as Donovan's loving 50's wife, white pearl necklace included.￼Production values are top notch. Janusz Kaminski's lovely muted photography, wonderful art direction designed by Adam Stockhausen, Kasia Walicka-Malmone's nuanced period costumes, and a subtle and haunting music score by the talented Thomas Newman all work to enhance this film.But it is Mr. Spielberg's vision that resonates. His love of period Americana and the late fifties era create powerful vignettes (e.g.: spectators in a courtroom rise segueing into students reciting the Pledge of Allegiance leading to a school lecture on the effects of radiation poisoning to highly impressionable children, desperate people trying to escape over the Berlin Wall and, moments later, seeing typical children playing and climbing over wire fences, reporters scurrying over broken discarded flashbulbs from old fashioned cameras that litter a courthouse corridor, a frightening aerial escape as a plane spins out of control. Special kudos to Michael Kahn for his skillful editing as well.) Spielberg's willingness to establish period details of pop culture images defines the film brilliantly.￼Bridge of Spies is a triumph and one of Mr. Spielberg's finest cinematic projects to date.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",10.0,Anonymous,History
Insider Trading,"It's always a bit dangerous to do historical drama, especially when things are within the memories of living people. This is the story of a prisoner exchange involving a Russian spy and U2 pilot Francis Gary Powers, whose spy plane was shot down by said Russians. Instead of a series of scenes of weapons fire and close calls, this is a very cerebral movie. Tom Hanks, in sort of an Atticus Finch mode, puts aside the furor of the nation and potential threats to his family, to follow the course of justice. He finds himself dealing with those who must cater to their nations positions in world politics. He also must act without sanction from his own country. Next to Hanks, Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel steals much of the movie. I'm sure some liberties were taken with facts along the way to make it more Hollywood, but this did nothing to diminish a real view of what the Cold War was like. And, yes, I remember ""Duck and cover!""",9.0,Anonymous,History
One lawyer to save everything...,"""Bridge of Spies"" is a Drama movie which tells the story of lawyer James B. Donovan who is entrusted to negotiate the release of an American pilot from Soviet Union in exchange a captive Soviet KGB spy who is held by the United States.I liked this movie a lot due to the fact that first of all is based on something that happened in reality and secondly because of the plot of it. In addition to this the cast of this movie was selected very nice with Tom Hanks who played as the lawyer James B. Donovan to make a very good interpretation. Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned was made by Mark Rylance who played as Rudolf Abel the Soviet spy. The direction of Steven Spielberg for one more time was exceptional and this can be seen very easily in the whole duration of the movie.Finally I believe that ""Bridge of Spies"" is a very good movie to watch and is a lesson for everyone because it represents and shows the difficulty of the job that this lawyer took over and how the choices that he made affect him but his family too.",7.0,Anonymous,History
how an ordinary insurance lawyer changed history.,"The film is very dialogue heavy, with great production design, well lit, expertly directed and filmed, a little humour mixed into the script, plus a brilliant performance by Mark Rylance. Both the script and the style of the film felt very old Hollywood to me, there's a strong focus on characters and carefully written dialogue rather than showy melodrama and to make clear that Mark Rylance is not playing the bad guy in the film his position is contrasted with an American captured by the USSR on similar spy charges. The characterization of Rylance's character also leads the audience towards sympathy with him, his mild manner and honest persona win not just his lawyer over but the wider audience.In terms of suitability for children I'd say it's fine, though they might find it a bit slow in parts, There's little violence and when it does happen it's nothing up close or graphic, though the mood is tense throughout. Some of the direction is slightly clunky and on the nose, but overall I think there's much to enjoy. The CGI is not great.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant!,"Based on the 1960 U-2 incident & set during the Cold War, 'Bridge of Spies' is a Brilliant true-story, told Brilliantly.

Creative historical theme succeeds,"Bridge of Spies states that it is based on true events. It depicts the story of a Mr Abel (Mark Rylance), captured and accused of being a spy during he 1950's at the heart of the cold war between the US and Russia. Tom Hanks plays the Lawyer Jack Donovan who is offered the task of defending Mr Abel.Hanks does more than that, delivering a heartwarming portrayal of a good man who just wants to do good. After defending Abel and fighting for his survival, the US continues it's spying actions over Russia.Hanks is eventually asked to take a role that will challenge his nerves, his family, and his belief in all he believes in. Will he succeed in this role, or will he suffer the same horrible fate as so many East Germans?I really liked Bridge of Spies. The direction by Spielberg was excellent. The costume and scenery were great - really authentic. Hanks was terrific, and Rylance was good, though I think Rocky in Creed should have won the Academy Award.

Satisfying Cold War drama with the classic humanity of Spielberg and Hanks,"At the height of the Cold War, insurance lawyer Jim Donovan is chosen by his peers to defend a Soviet spy captured by the U.S. Donovan faces suspicion and animosity from practically everyone, but is determined the spy get a fair trial.A few years later, when the Soviets capture an important American spy,Donovan is tapped to arrange a swap. Plans are complicated by the construction of the Berlin Wall, as Donovan must negotiate traveling between East and West Berlin for the exchange to work.The film does an excellent job of conveying the realities of the Cold War on both sides, both the physical backdrop of Berlin and the emotional world inhabited by Americans, Soviets, and East Germans. As Spielberg so often does, Bridge of Spies focuses on the difference a person of conscience and humanity can make in a fraught situation. It does not disappoint. I particularly enjoyed the rich detail: Donovan's kids learning to ""duck and cover"" at school, East Berlin's bombed- out buildings and gangs, Donovan's wife asking him to bring home some marmalade.If you want to watch a movie that both explores the challenges and complexity of Cold War history and also leaves you feeling hopeful about humanity, I recommend Bridge of Spies.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"""Bridge of Spies"" breathes new life into historical films","When the director of ""Jaws,"" the star of ""Forrest Gump"" and the writers of ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" come together to make a film, you know you're in for a treat.""Bridge of Spies"" is set in 1957 during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested by the FBI and charged with being a Soviet spy. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is asked by his partners to defend Abel in the impending trial.Donovan is ridiculed and scorned by his fellow Americans for representing and defending Abel, as many of them would rather see him hanging from a rope. However, Donovan's success in keeping Abel away from the death penalty proves vital in negotiating with the Soviets after they capture an American spy.Whenever I watch Tom Hanks, seldom do I see Tom Hanks. Whether it's Forrest Gump, Captain John H. Miller or Woody from ""Toy Story,"" Hanks consistently excels at becoming the characters he portrays, and he delivers a dynamic performance as James Donovan. The character is decent and kind, but firm in upholding the law and his personal values.Mark Rylance's portrayal of Rudolf Abel is Oscar-worthy. Abel is an awkward, mild-mannered and unusually calm elderly man, the last person you would suspect as a Soviet spy. In the face of potential execution following a guilty verdict, Abel remains cool and collected. Blown away by his lack of alarm or concern, Donovan questions, ""Are you not worried?"" to which Abel responds, ""Would it help?""Ethan and Joel Coen's script dishes out the perfect comedic, dramatic and thrilling elements that make ""Bridge of Spies"" great. Its dialogue drives the story, and while this may turn off certain audiences, I found it enthralling. Fundamental themes of integrity, perseverance and standing up for what's right are broadcast clearly and effectively through the actions and words of the story's protagonists.Like most of his films, Steven Spielberg's touch is evident from the first shot. There are several scenes throughout the film in which two or more people are simply exchanging dialogue in a room. While on paper this may come across as dull, Spielberg keeps you engaged by positioning his characters in different places during a scene. Through this he is able to portray a variety of shot types and angles and simulate the effect of cuts that aren't actually there.Spielberg's narrative direction is as captivating as his visual storytelling. ""Bridge of Spies"" is based on a true story, and very little is altered or fabricated for the sake of entertainment. Aside from a few minor plot points and inconsistencies of the spies' time in captivity, Spielberg and the Coen brothers stay true to the intriguing story of how an insurance lawyer from Brooklyn saved the lives of two Americans and a Soviet spy.Novelty in today's cinema is a hallowed treasure. Unique scripts are replaced with unnecessary sequels and reboots, and dialogue-driven stories dwell in the shadow of the next Marvel blockbuster. Despite Hollywood's ever-growing lack of originality, directors like Spielberg continually restore my faith in filmmaking. ""Bridge of Spies"" breathes new life into historical thrillers, and is a must-see for lovers of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Another legendary Spielberg and Hanks wartime drama,"As with most Steven Spielberg films, 'Bridge of Spies' was a shoe-in for a best picture nomination at the 2016 Academy Awards. Wartime setting? Check. International relations-infused drama based on true events? Check. Tom Hanks? Of course - check.Despite the formulaic nature of 'Spies,' the film is unsurprisingly as well done as most things Spielberg touches. He has a way with turning something that could be very straightforward on paper into a story that tugs at the heartstrings while making several twists and turns. Here, we see a bond develop between Hanks's virtuous Brooklyn lawyer and an alleged Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in a tangled web of deceit, wargames and trickery that defined this era. There's a cold and dark undertone to the film, which matches the harsh elements on screen, but Hanks's James Donovan is a lighthouse in his crusade for justice.But it's not just the acting that stands out here. The execution of 'Spies' is something to take note of, from the use of visual call-backs throughout the film like the images of people jumping the Berlin wall and backyard fences to the refrain of Rylance's question ""Would it help?"" in response to multiple statements Hanks makes, these serve as Spielberg's fingerprints on his product.'Bridge of Spies' is not the most memorable film from this genre. Instead, it's an understated story of personal achievement that is happy to exist as a snapshot of a moment in time from a contentious period in our history.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Once again, the movie is nice because of several factors (performance, the created atmosphere, etc.), but it is not intelligent enough to motivate deeper reflection.While the ""good guys"" have richer shades of grey, Spielberg almost always portraits cartoonish ""bad guys"".The good thing about this movie, is that as a Walt Disney movie, it has a high motivational value that with a happy ending, help people to enjoy the time.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great performances and amazing dialogue.... But I didn't love it?,"Bridge of Spies is one big mystery for me. It felt like a love/hate relationship, like Bridge of Spies and I enjoy each other, but we secretly dislike each other too. I did enjoy this movie, but it's easily my least favorite of the best picture nominations for 2015/2016, even more shocking considering that it was directed by the great and mighty Steven Spielberg.Your premise is it's 1960, it's the Cold War, and your main character, played by the one and only Tom Hanks, is just an American attorney who is put into this situation of releasing a spy plane pilot for the United States, in exchange for a Soviet spy that the Americans have captured, and this is the story of how the trade went on and the trials and tribulations of getting this very difficult swap made.Okay guys, before you watch this movie, be prepared for what this movie is: It's not an action movie... Despite the fact that this is pretty much is a war type of movie, for the most part not even a little bit. It's lots of negotiations and back and forth of trying find compromise of making this soldier swap happen. However, the lines that these actors deliver can be downright nail-biting and thrilling at times. The power and audacity in which many of these lines are delivered was very spine tingling at times, and I enjoyed that thoroughly. Unsurprisingly, Tom Hanks was the best at this, and his performance was outstanding. Oscar worthy? Possibly. I'd stick him up there maybe for a nomination, but definitely not the winner. Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy was a surprise standout performance that I really enjoyed in this movie, and occasionally brought a comedic spot to this movie.But there was an issue with this movie that could be more to do with me than the movie, but there were many periods in the movie where I just got downright bored. I felt like in some moments that I was just waiting for the plot to continue on.... And it wasn't. This was a stab in the gut, because I was bored during quite a few parts of this movie. Like I said, I had a love hate relationship with this movie. I was either intrigued by the dialogue and the magnitude of some of the moments in this film, or I just got downright bored and almost irritated at times, waiting for something bigger to happen.Never the less, this movie is directed exquisitely. Something this movie did was make me feel like I was in the time period, and submerged in this world, thanks in no small part to the excellent directing by Spielberg. It's a well shot and fundamentally sound movie that l's obviously well put together.All and all, this was an entertaining movie for me. Don't get me wrong, I love period pieces and historical dramas/thriller, but for some reason, this movie didn't captivate me the way I was truly hoping it would.7.75/10 on my Wynner Scale",8.0,Anonymous,History

A million-dollar set-up that is not payed-off........,"Name every aspect involving making a film and thumbs go up with this one.The master speaks, uses his skills to the sublime. No one doubts. Spielberg at his best. Right?Yes, but...1/3 courtroom, 2/3 cold war suspense. Thats a rough outline of the scrips structure. The latter would be deeply satisfying for it's exiting, sentimentally old- fashion, home- cooked cold-war-spy-movie grandeur. But it is not satisfying to me. Why? Because there is a 1/3 courtroom part that is so much more, so much more promising, so much more layered, with so many exiting set-ups, that i miss - i miss him more often these days - good old Clint Eatwood to bring all that complexity to a satisfying end. The first part is not about cold war, not about a spy and not about court. The fist part is about.....us. Us people in modern days turmoil , caught in the middle of international terrorist fear. In the middle of fear for Muslims, in the middle of fear for 'the other' human being, in the middle of group pressure, consensus, media hysteria, etc..... The first part is showing a hero who thinks for himself, who is not giving in to group- thinking, who dares to stand alone, who uses reason in the right way, who is a hero because he keeps his brain sound and clear, his private property, not owned by Apple, Google or God knows who..... All in the setting of the 50s. This 1/3 part promises a movie that uses a cold war concept to dig deeper into the psychology of group thinking and the harmful consequences of it.Instead, we turn to a good old spy movie, Spielberg forgets his million-dollar worth set-ups, leaves us alone with the moral expectations we developed and gives us goodies and baddies....with a twist, sure, but......Americans that think, act straight and...... Eurpoeans that act weird and confused.Great movie to watch, because it is nothing more than great popcorn. My favorite is white ceddar cheese btw...",8.0,Anonymous,History

This is a great and very well-done movie. Spielberg does another awesome job with this movie. It has great themes and is thought-provoking at times. It has a great message about standing up for what is right, even if/when everyone else hates you for doing it.
This is Tom Hanks best role (that I've seen so far, anyway). He does a fantastic job as Donovan and literally embodies in every sense who the real Donovan was. Everyone does an awesome job, really. Their acting is very believable.
Definitely watch this!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting subject matter yet a lack of suspense,"Spielberg manages to create a film that is able to keep hold of your attention for its relatively bloated runtime, but only just. The true story is that of interest, especially if you are into the Cold War however a lack of memorable moments and a flat third act make it hard to recommend too strongly. Its a fine film, with good acting and excellent cinematography however it won't be something you rush to see again any time soon.",7.0,Anonymous,History
well-made,"It's 1957 Brooklyn. Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is arrested for being a Soviet spy. Insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is pushed to defend him. Despite popular pressure, Donovan fights to prevent Abel's execution. When U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers is shoot down over the Soviet Union, CIA director Allen Dulles recruits Donovan to test out the prisoner exchange idea as a private citizen. American student Frederic Pryor gets imprisoned on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. Donovan decides to hold out for both Americans' release.Director Steven Spielberg delivers a well-made movie. However, there is a lack of tension for most of the movie. Spielberg needs to ramp up the danger to Donovan. He needs to gin up more danger to his job and to his family. The shooting into his house is fine. I expected a scene of his wife getting confronted. Having said that, other scenes seem too heavy-handed especially the last few scenes back home. Spielberg is also putting in too much of a glare which gives the movie a dreamy quality. Instead, it needs a darker, harsher, and scarier tone. Tom Hanks is a bit too calm. He needs to be scared in more times. The time he's confronted by the street youths in East Berlin is a prime example. It needs to be shocking and it needs to come out of nowhere. Instead, it's laid out before it happens and it's a source of comedy afterward. The tension is never too high. It could have been a darker, scarier scene.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Competent, unspectacular but enjoyable","A well-made and acted but understated cold-war drama about the exchange of prisoners between the USA and the USSR in Germany.Tom Hanks is reliably good as the insurance lawyer James Donovan, drawn into cold-war intrigue, representing a Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in court. Mark Rylance gives a quiet, understated performance as the spy. Rylance is competent, but the performance is rather a surprising nod for an Oscar.After an American spy pilot is shot down over Soviet air space, much of the film is set in Berlin as Donovan negotiates with Soviet and East German authorities for the release of the pilot and an American student captured in East Berlin in exchange for Abel.The scene where the pilots plane is shot down, is poorly filmed with cheap special effects.But otherwise the film is well shot with excellent period detail and atmosphere. Although some of the scenes in East Berlin verge slightly on absurd, a hint of the Coen brothers influence as screenwriters for the film.Amy Ryan is largely wasted as Donovan's wife while the early scenes detailing Abels court case feel a bit short and underdeveloped. And the final scenes fall prey to Steven Spielberg's usual twee sensibilities. But overall, the film represents a decent notch in the well worn and capable partnership between Spielberg and Hanks.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Another Great a Effort By Spielberg,"Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors of all time with his massive and mostly amazing filmography this was one of my most anticipated movies of 2015 and it lived up to most expectations. Tom hanks is fantastic in this movie he is instantly likable as he is set up from the first scene as an honourable and hard working man. But my god Mark Rylance was outstanding in this movie, he stole every scene he was in and his ""Standing Man"" speech is one of the best monologues of the year. The era of the Cold War was very well done as it was clear how many people hated the soviets in this movie and also made for a lot of very intense moments and gave the impression that things could fall apart at any moment. Like most of Spielberg films Bridge of Spies is superbly directed with most of the scenes are long cuts, tracking shots and close ups. It could have been very easy in a dialogue driven film like to cut a lot but Spielberg doesn't fall for it. This film is not without its flaws, for one Powers' are in this movie was slow and honestly unnecessary as looking back at Savung Private Ryan the person they were trying to save in that movie didn't even make an appearance until 2/3 of the way through and that type of decision would also have worked very well for this movie. The film also suffers from a slow paced second half. With certain obstacles becoming a bit silly and drawn out and being a bit repetitive after a while. The ending however was just perfect for what it needed to be. Not without its flaws but still a great movie and another Spielberg classic.8.5/10 A-",8.0,Anonymous,History
Another masterpiece from Spielberg/Hanks,"Who said that a thriller has to be violent to be considered as successful? Bridge of Spies is a smart movie about the Gary Powers affair, a dramatic event which could have become the spark of a destructive conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union.Despite what the title may suggest, Bridge of Spies is not a movie about espionage. Don't expect to see thrilling chases, firefights or anything we could see in James Bond or Mission Impossible. This movie is about the real story of the efforts of one man, Jim Donovan, a Brooklyn lawyer specialized in insurance issues, who became involved in spite of himself in the most sensitive crisis of that time and, by using his negotiating skills, is trying to settle peacefully the crisis by organizing an exchange between Powers and a Soviet spy who was arrested prior to the crash of the U2.Once again, Tom Hanks is playing with perfection this role of a man who put his reputation, his life and his family's in line by defending a Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (played admirably by Mark Rylance) because he truly believes that anybody, whatever the charges are against him or her, deserves the right to be defended.Mark Rylance is also perfect impersonating Rudolf Abel. His performance is very sober and I have some sympathy for the character. As Donovan says in the movie, Abel is just a loyal soldier of his country and he should not be branded as a traitor as many did back in that time.But what gives to this movie all its credits is its sobriety and objectivity depicting the tension between the two sides back in that era, the hypocrisy of both judicial system including ours who wants the world to be considered as a model of justice but in reality are ready to deny the values of our country by violating the Constitution and depriving Abel of his basic right to defend himself.There are some scenes who literally broke my heart. I had tears watching Jim's son filling the bathtub of water because in school he learned that the first basic needs which couldn't be able to be fulfilled in case of a nuclear bombardment will be electricity and water or when those two people got shot to death while trying to climb the Berlin wall and escape the oppressive Soviet regime. I looked up and it turned out that more than 200 people were gunned down trying to escape including women.So yes maybe some would have preferred an action movie but for the ones who prefers a realistic recalling of the facts like myself will really appreciate this picture. We need more movies like Bridges of spies. Movies who can give you a realistic insight of what was going on. In that matter Bridge of spies is accomplishing its mission very perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Bridging the Gap,"But it's either a very big gap or a very big bridge (or maybe both). So to some this may feel too long. What it definitely is true, is the fact that the movie takes its time to tell the (true) story behind it all. While Spielberg probably took some liberties (as almost every filmmaker does when they tackle a true life story/incident), this is very interesting and tense stuff.Though you wouldn't know when looking at the main character (besides the one Tom Hanks is playing), because of him underplaying everything. Was the real person like that? Haven't read much about that, but the movie may take a couple of people to take a look into that. And for that, the movie achieved what it wanted: Putting a spotlight on something not many are aware of. Spielberg and Kaminsky always deliver when it comes to settings/camera of course, acting is great too, so it's kind of a ""no-brainer""",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A Strong and Bright Light, James B. Donovan, Trying to Make the Difference in a World, the Cold War, Full of Darkness","Bridge of Spies is the fourth collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. This particular one is much more focused on persuasive and intense dialogues and not on big action scenes, but due to the beauty and consistency of the conversations, the film doesn't become boring.It has a captivating and inspiring plot and is based on a true story that took place during the Cold War. As presume, the direction is spectacular, Steven Spielberg once again proves to be one of the best. With the help of Janusz Kaminski, movie cinematographer, they manage capture the minutiae and subtleties in each scene, making the picture having an amazing aesthetic, besides the setting and scenery being very well-constructed and provide a higher truthfulness to the movie. Considering the portrayed event and troubled time that happened, the film could have brought a higher tension, the lack is mostly felt around Tom Hanks' character, James B. Donovan, as he's doing something so outrageous in the Americans' perspective. The hostility is there,it's perceptible but it's not high as it might be. A aspect which could help fulfill this need is the soundtrack, which didn't show up as expected, instead was restrained and discreet.Tom Hanks is the highlight among the cast, he delivers a great performance. The character is fantastic, his power of rhetoric and persuasion are astonishing as a result his speeches are just jaw-dropping. Another good acting was Mark Rylance being Rudolf Abel. He transmits such serenity and wisdom due to his personality, and when he and Tom Hanks are in the same scene, you just sit back and enjoy their chemistry creating some impressive discussions.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Tense humorous cat-and-mouse game,"The bar association asks insurance lawyer James B. Donovan to defend a suspected Russian spy arrested on American soil. When an American spy is captured Donovan becomes a negotiator for two of the world powers to agree the prisoners release.With the film based on real-life events writers Matt Charman, Joel and Ethan Coen turns a secret prisoner exchange between the CIA and the KGB into a tense and often humorous cat-and-mouse game. Suffering with a cold, quick thinking breifcase touting Tom Hanks' law-abiding lead character Donovan is gripping as he is used as a go between by his own government with German and Russian officials. Hanks brings an everyday man vulnerability, akin to Michael Caines' Harry Palmer to the role.Steven Spielberg offers a finely crafted Cold War espionage thriller, wonderfully recreating the Cold War era thanks to clever special effects. The stakes are high, you witness the Berlin Wall being built, it's an appealing diplomatic film. There are tense moments littered throughout, notably when Donovan is tasked in defending a Russian spy in a court of law, the backlash from his community and the danger he puts his family carries an impact.Its a fine production. Bridge of Spies is interesting throughout and it surprisingly captures some old fashion Hollywood magic.",,Anonymous,History
Stodgy and old-fashioned,"Predictable and somewhat plodding story-telling. Yes Spielberg/Hanks are fabulous, but nothing felt fresh or original, no surprises. Watching masters doing what they have done over and over, for many years is OK, but felt stale. It's a good story, well acted, directed and written, but lacked spark. The first 30 minutes or so seemed pointless. They make good use of period cars but that was about it. Anticipated Schindler's List, but got 1941, not great. There is a moral compass but the energy was flat. Something is missing, no excitement, no chemistry. The family scenes felt inauthentic, forced intimacies. Minimal exploration of interpersonal relationships, ineffective and emotionless. Overall, disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
One of my favorites,"This is on my top ten list for best acted and best directed films that cover our involvement in the Cold War. How can you go wrong with actors Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance? They are superb. And Spielberg's direction gives us a great mix of historical perspective and suspense, because frankly almost none of us living really remember the details of these events as they actually played out. You'd have to be 90 years old or a history wank to know what's going to happen, so we are given Tom Hanks as the lawyer James Donovan to guide us through those difficult times. Mark Rylance plays the Russian spy whom Donovan defends at the expense of his career, family and death threats. Rylance, who also played Thomas Cromwell in Wolf Hall, is completely believable as the honorable, dead pan, Russian spy who can't help but be admired, if not for being a spy, but for his gentle manner and humanity. Hanks and Rylance are most memorable, but the story never plays second fiddle. Mixed with the embarrassing events of the U2 spy plane, the backdrop of our fear of Russia, and the dreary, dark winter of living in East Berlin, we are given a perfectly entertaining account of serious times.",10.0,Anonymous,History
the U-2 incident was one of the sketchiest ever,"People in the 21st century might not be that familiar with the U-2 incident (a US spy plane got shot down over the Soviet Union and the pilot got arrested). If Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" is a good introduction. Indeed, one of the most important scenes is when Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) explains that he is defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) because the Constitution says that even the people charged with the most heinous crimes deserve equal protection under the law; this scene is just as relevant during the so called War on Terrorism, which is now likely to go supernova under a Trump presidency.But there was another side to the U-2 incident. Eisenhower was planning a summit with the leaders of the UK, France and the USSR, in the hope of easing Cold War tensions. The U-2 spy plane got shot down right before the summit was to take place, and the summit got canceled. It looks as though the plane got sent over the USSR to deliberately sabotage the summit, as the US hardliners didn't want an easing of Cold War tensions. This makes clear why Ike warned about the military industrial complex.A previous reviewer complained that the movie didn't emphasize things that were representative of the era, like cars or music. I interpreted the absence of these things to mean that this story is a timeless one, especially the matter of civil liberties in wartime.I'd say that Rylance deserved his Oscar win.",6.0,Anonymous,History
very bad fake,"this is a silly and stupid set of stamps and manifestation of an inferiority complex from a lack of knowledge. In the film, the mass of historical and factual errors, and the film is not a history of the spy Rudolf Abel and his exchange on pilot Francis Gary Powers, and a pretentious propaganda picture.It all started back in the Spielberg movie ""Terminal"", but in this movie took a truly catastrophic proportions. Spielberg does not have a clue about life in the USSR and the GDR, and all of his view of life in these countries is based on a picture of the American propaganda magazines and newspapers of the time (ie, during the Cold War. Who started the United States and its allies, and the Warsaw Pact was created as a response against the NATO alliance. And the plan of offensive war in Europe, originally did not belong to the Soviet Union and the United States and the United Kingdom).If you are interested in the history of flying spy plane U-2 over the Soviet Union and the subsequent exchange of Francis Gary Powers to the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, see the Soviet movie ""Dead Season"". It is much better to do than this fake of Spielberg. In addition, in this old Russian movie authentic costumes, interiors and uniforms of the period. Unlike Spielberg film in which nothing is authentic, except for helmets GDR Army.By the way, Francis Gary Powers voluntarily told all in captivity, without tortures and horrors in ""Spilberg style"". Upon returning to the US, he was accused that not blew himself up along with the aircraft at ejection (under catapult CIA profit laid an explosive charge) and that did not take the poisoned needle for suicide (Francis Powers voluntarily gave the needle during the arrest).If you interesting to see a movie about Powers, watch Soviet movie ""We accuse"" (1985). As far as I know, in the United States was no movie about Francis Gary Powers. Although he fulfilled his soldier duty to the end, and died like a hero - rescuing children from falling helicopter.This movie - 0 from 10.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Powerful Performances Perfectly Recaptures this Incredible True Story,","Bridge of Spies is a stellar movie with a very well developed plot and a magnificent cast. We are almost immediately taken in to the drama and intensity of this true story from the very beginning, as we follow an insurance lawyer who is tasked with defending a Soviet spy who has betrayed his country. We manage to gain support from the spy as we see his point of view, beautifully captured by the great Steven Spielberg.On the other hand, I did feel that it did not give us enough insight on the seriousness of the Cold War. There is a scene where Donovan views a bunch of people being shot down while travelling on a train, I would like to to have seen more of this, to emphasise the struggles this movie is dealing with.The performances are the highlight of it all, Tom Hanks is breathtaking as the lead role, James Donovan, perfectly conveying the transformation of an everyday lawyer turned hero, and Mark Rylance delivers a well deserved Oscar win as Rudolf Abel, a flawed, conflicted character who we can not help but support as a result of Rylance's charm. Terrificly acted, superb direction and a great script, Bridge of Spies is certainly worth the watch for anyone looking for a good drama.An insurance lawyer is tasked with defending a Soviet spy, a job that ends up stretching far beyond the courtroom.Best Performance: Tom Hanks / Worst Performance: Alan Alda",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Old School Filmmaking, At Its Finest","Bridge of Spies is a well crafted film that tells an important yet unnoticed story on the Cold War. Don't expect guns blazing and pistol whipping action however, as Steven Spielberg's picture keeps away from the frontlines & focuses on the talking points of governments at war. In the film, we see James Donovan, an insurance lawyer roped into representing a Soviet spy, who is later promoted as a negotiator for the exchange of American POWs held captive by the Commies.As a film that relies heavily on directing, dialogue & acting, BoS delivers. Spielberg showcases masterful camerawork, adding thrill & emotions through well timed close ups and character placement in long takes. This compliments very well with the crackling script stamped by the Coen brothers. As for our stars, Tom Hanks gives another Oscar worthy performance as his dramatization of intense and colorful moments was captivating. Thanks to his satisfying performance, I was blindsided with how un-dull the film was specially for a ""talking"" film. Mark Rylance was just as impressive! His delivery of the restrained and unnerved Soviet mole takes an unsympathetic character & turns it into one of the years 's memorable movie creations.Overall, I would give this film an 8/10 and further props for its old school Hollywood traits in filmmaking.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An Old-School Cold War Spy Yarn,"The missus asked me what I wanna see this week and I replied: ""what else, the Spielberg-Hanks one"". This collaboration has always been a marriage made in film-heaven. Yes, I even adore The Terminal. But I don't know about this latest one. My wife dozed off a few times and the dude sitting next to me slept through most of it.The story is based on the true-life tale of James Donovan (Hanks); a lawyer who was pushed headfirst into the Cold War during the 1960s when he had to negotiate for the release of downed U2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) after the airman was shot down over Russia.The title refers to the popular Cold War nickname for what's now the Glienicke Bridge connecting East and West Germany at the time the film is set. Its official name then was the Bridge of Unity, but it garnered its alternate moniker due to its notoriety as a prisoner exchange point for Western and Soviet powers.This Cold War story is certainly ripe for a rip-roaring cross-country yarn but Spielberg went for a sweet classical tone instead. There is a certain elegant sheen to the proceedings and the film poses deep ponderous questions like what makes us citizens of our countries. Hanks' nobility shines off like a light from a candle in a dark room as he takes up the job that nobody wants. The spycraft is captivating and absorbing, and when I say spycraft I don't mean Bourne or Bond. Dead drops are meticulous affairs. Gadgets are giant cameras installed on the bottom of light-weight aircrafts and hollow coins with a poisoned pin for instant death inflicted on oneself by oneself. It is all good and fine but the film couldn't engage me totally with its lack of severity and tension.For me, the film worked best when James Donovan (Tom Hanks) and Rudolf Abel (Michael Rylance) are sharing a scene together. Abel's face is impenetrable, yet it is filled with the weight of histories and subsumed patriotism. There is a scene in which he opens up to Donovan that is absolutely haunting. The moment the movie just focuses on Hanks it loses me. There is nothing wrong with Hanks. Hanks is just playing.... Hanks for the umpteenth time. You know which Hanks I am talking about... he is the cleverest man, the perfect man in the whole world. He bounces up from setbacks with a dusting off of his pants. You know he will save the day. Mind you, there's nothing wrong with that. But it didn't help the cause of the character when he is depicted as the noblest Saint of Earth and all others are evil, vile and dumb. Where are the cat and mouse games and the battle of wits between the Germans, Soviets and this lone American knight in a shiny armor? Nobody stood a chance against Hanks, and to really drum it into you Donovan's Messiah powers, every American looks to him like he is the enemy of the state and the scum of the earth. I don't appreciate being manipulated like this, especially by a movie.Still, this is a handsomely made film with some superbly crafted scenes that will remain in my memory for a long time, like the building of the Berlin Wall scene. Spielberg's typical musical cues are a little too in-my-face for my liking, forcing me to feel a certain way. The narrative circles and probes, but it didn't manage to percolate. Usually Spielberg's magic envelopes me and makes me a believer, just not in the case of Bridge of Spies. The film resonates and beats with the sweet energy of a full orchestra with Spielberg-Hanks as the maestro, but like Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool's new manager, sometimes I prefer Heavy Metal.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Every person matters,"Amidst the megahits of Q4 (is winter the new summer?) comes this quiet sleeper from Steven Spielberg. It's a chamber piece defined by soft words and silent gestures. Even the true story upon which it's based is a relatively unseen bit of history. Although it's such an interesting story, you wonder why.You've seen the big beats in the trailer. But this is a movie of details as tiny as the secret messages that unshakeable Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) receives on the sly. He's captured and fast-tracked through the American justice system. Insurance lawyer Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks) represents him, but he's powerless against a guilty-by-default verdict.Then the Ruskies capture a US spy and an American student. As a US citizen ostensibly representing no one but his clients, Donovan is bunged off to a divided Berlin to negotiate a swap: one Russian for two Americans. The devil's in the detail – and, as Donovan discovers, there are so many damned details.Spielberg is cinema's top craftsman. We know this. But he does little here to draw attention to that consummate skill – and I mean that as a compliment. The ""quiet camera"" of Lincoln continues. And as a story it's as much a humanitarian one as Lincoln, although the script here (sharpened up by the Coen brothers, who are presumably to thank for the plentiful ironic humour) is less labyrinthine, less grandiose. More on-the-nose.So is Thomas Newman's music, sadly, which sounds like one imagines a Spielberg movie should be scored, all sugary clarinet softness. It jars with the austere Cold War mood and only really making sense in the final scenes, where a creeping schmaltz lurks. The Lives of Others this ain't.That's not to belittle the human emotion the film possesses, which is mostly convincing. Abel's ""standing man"" speech is a keeper. But beyond that, Bridge of Spies is a film of Big Themes: what nationality means; what professional duty means; and the arbitrariness of national borders. Donovan is genuinely baffled by the hypocrisy of his superiors, regarding Abel as merely a human being doing a job – the same job many US spies are asked to do.Rylance, subtle and dignified, is a shoe-in for a Supporting Actor gong. Hanks, meanwhile, makes it look effortless, somehow forging a relatable everyman out of an iron-nosed lawyer. These are actors at the top of their game.Intense, involving, and intelligent: if you're looking for something patient and quietly moving at the multiplex, look no further. It might look like minor Spielberg, but it's a major dramatic success.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A notable Spielberg film about an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy and set during the Cold War.,"During the Cold War, an American lawyer called James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy called Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) . Francis Gary Powers was a U-2 pilot who was shot down by the Soviet Union, that it was a huge international incident. Rudolf Abel is accused of being a Soviet spy, in a trial that only pretends to be fair. Committed to the principle that the accused deserves a vigorous defense, he mounts the best defense of Abel he can, before a strict judge (Dakin Matthews), declining along the way to cooperate in the CIA's attempts to induce him to violate the confidentiality of his communications with his client. In the shadow of war, one man showed the world what we stand for !. In a world on the brink the difference between war and peace was one honest man !. Inspired by true events !.An interesting and engaging film with thrills, emotion, drama , historical events and nice interpretations. Steven Spielberg once again directs Tom Hanks, in a thriller inspired by real events about an advocate at law who has to help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot and written by the prestigious brothers Ethan and Joel Coen in collaboration with Matt Charman. Tom Hanks portrays very well in his usual style Jim Donovan, an insurance lawyer (although he also acted as a prosecutor in the Nuremberg trials), who is entrusted with the defense of Rudolf Abel. The person in charge of giving life to the spy is Mark Rylance, whose performance earned him an Oscar and the BAFTA for best supporting actor as well as a Golden Globe nomination in the same category. Steven Spielberg cast Sir Mark Rylance in the movie after seeing his Tony Award-winning performance in Twelfth Night, which earned Rylance his third Tony Award. In addition, the film won the David di Donatello for best foreign film and was nominated for an Academy Award for best film, original screenplay, music, sound mixing and production. Along with Hanks and Mark Rylance, the cast is completed by other good actors, such as: Jesse Plemons, Amy Ryan, Alan Alda , Sebastian Koch, Austin Stowell, Dakin Matthews, Billy Magnussen, Scott Shepherd, among others.Evocative scenarios by production designer Adam Stockhausen, Janusz Kaminski's photography and Thomas Newman's music enhance this brooding and attractive historical drama.

"The real title should be ""Tom Hanks is a hero, once more""","If you expect to see much spying or bridges in this movie you will be sorely disappointed. The plot is about ace lawyer Tom Hanks (his screen name does not really matter, since the movie is just star performance) who is going to prove how good he is, both to the Russians and the East-Germans.A rather puffy-faced Hanks is in most scenes, playing a smug and arrogant lawyer, who always gets the last word and whatever he wants. His performance as a the lawyer is rather overbearing and even slightly unpleasant, but the public still liked him a lot and laughed at all his one-liners (again, star performance, rather than good plot or script).The spies or would-be spies featured in the movie are: 1) a sour little man, who speaks with what sounded to me an Irish accents and who was supposed to be funny with his unflappability. He repeats ""Would it help if I worry?"" countless times, every time getting a laugh 2) a rather dumb American pilot and 3) another sort of heroic American student, getting mixed up with foreign politics, when he'd better stayed at home. They all seem to be just props to give Hanks a chance to shine.The moral of the story should be that all countries should be better off minding their own business.

Well Told,"In the late 1950s insurance lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is tasked by the CIA with defending Russian spy Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance) in a U.S. court of law. Later Donovan is tasked with negotiating the swap of Abel for downed U.S. U2 (spy plane) pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). Then Donovan learns of an American Economics student, Frederick Pryor (Will Rogers) held by the Russians and wants to do a 2-for-1 deal that the CIA is against. The CIA just wants Powers. Here we go.The only action scenes show the U2 spy plane being hit by Russian missiles and Gary Powers trying to reach the plane's self destruct button. These scenes are extremely good.Other than those brief action scenes, this is a talk-fest, but the conversations don't drag and are very concise among the Russians, the East Germans (this was the time the Berlin Wall went up), the CIA, some other U.S. government officials and James Donovan.The most engaging scenes are between Rudolph Abel and Donovan and they are excellent as the dialogues were spot on. When Donovan asks Abel why he doesn't show that he is worried Abel replies, "" Would it help?"" It wouldn't surprise me if Mark Rylance as Abel is nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Award. He is really good.This was history being made and this story is well told. There is nothing complicated and you always know what is going on. However, I was not aware that Donovan also wanted to get Pryor out of Russia as part of the deal. Tom Hanks as James Donovan in this role is perfect.

Spielberg Can Make Even the Cold War Maudlin,"I thought that the Coen brothers as co-screenwriters of ""Bridge of Spies"" meant that we might get some restraint and intelligence to balance the maudlin platitudes that almost certainly come attached with a Steven Spielberg film. But I was wrong. Spielberg takes a chilly Cold War setting and then proceeds to pump sentimentality into it until by the end it's as sunny and warm as a Folgers coffee commercial.Tom Hanks, as usual, does his best to calm Spielberg down, and plays the main character as an every man Joe trying to do the right thing despite Spielberg's attempts to cram his heroics down our throats. But by the film's end, he's as overwhelmed by the rest of us by Spielberg's schmaltz, served with healthy doses of the requisite pounding Spielbergian score, this one supplied not by John Williams but rather by Thomas Newman.Mark Rylance won an Oscar for playing a Russian spy who barely speaks, and I suppose I appreciated his ability to convey emotions without histrionics, something Spielberg certainly isn't capable of. But I can't say I really see that he did anything special enough to warrant an Academy Award.The Coens were nominated for their script, which they co-wrote with Matt Charman, and the film also copped nominations for Best Picture, Production Design, Original Score, and Sound Mixing.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,History
Far From Spielbergs Best But Still Fantastic,"When I first saw Bridge of Spies in theatres it was purely because it was a Spielberg film yet I was still intrigued to see it I love Tom Hanks he's one of my all time favourite actors and thought it isn't Spielbergs best it's far from his worst and Bridge of Spies is a fantastic film with two Fantastic lead performances from both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. Like more of Spielbergs more recent films this is more of a dialogue driven drama and it's not discredit to him his films all have amazing dialogue and this is no different it makes for a compelling film that any Spielberg fan should watch. Tom Hanks in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg is fantastic in this film he's impossible not to get behind he just knows how to portray the every man quality of his character that just wants to do the right thing and that's what makes James Donovan such a great protagonist for this film he just wants to do the right thing despite all the hatred it brings him. But ultimately movie new comer Mark Ryalnce stole this movie and deservedly won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for it he has amazing chemistry with Hanks. Ryalnce just brings a likability and vulnerability to him and his ""Standing Man"" scene will go down as one of the great movie scenes in a Spielberg movie. The courtroom scenes in this movie really gave you a sense of how people were during this time and gives you a chance to see what Donovan and Abel were facing for what they were trying to do. The flaws from this film though come from its second half the plot to free Powers just wasn't neither as compelling as the plot to free Abel and I would have personally would have portrayed his character more like James Ryan from another Spielberg film ""Saving Private Ryan"" it just would have made us more excited to finally see him and would have made for a more compelling story arc.But in the end I like Bridge of Spies much more than I ever thought I would it has fantastic dialogue, characters and performances making for one of the finest films of 2015. 88%-A-",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""Would it help?""","Mark Rylance's laconic Colonel Abel (improbably but authentically speaking English with a Scots accent) lies at the heart of this drama; but Tom Hawks being the bigger star dominates the footage and accounts for the film's whopping running time.Had this story actually been filmed in 1960 it would have been terser and in black & white; over fifty years later Steven Spielberg bathes it in a nostalgic glow with Edward Hopper lighting and '77 Sunset Strip' on the telly and 'Spartacus' at the pictures.In the light of current events in the Ukraine it's sympathetic portrayal of a Russkie might raise eyebrows (particularly as Abel in one scene praises Shostakovich, who'd been given an extremely hard time by the very regime he served); but the incredible heroism shown only last week by Marina Ovsyannikova is a salutary reminder that not all Russians are monsters.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A real accomplishment,"A thriller co-authored by Joel and Ethan Coen, directed by Steven Spielberg and, starring Tom Hanks promises much - and fortunately ""Bridge Of Spies"" delivers. For all this super-talent, what gives the movie such power is the compelling story which is largely inspired by true events.At the height of the Cold War in 1962, an insurance lawyer called James Donovan (Hanks) - without any specific status or authority and suffering from a head cold during the key negotiations - managed to facilitate a spy swap. In return for downed U2 pilot Gary Powers, (and an unfortunate American student detained in East Berlin), the Americans agreed to hand over convicted Soviet KGB spy Rudolf Abel, the physical exchange of the actual spies taking place on Glienicke Bridge (hence the title of the movie echoing that other bridge in Venice).This is a great role for Hanks who plays the kind of decent American that is rare in the movies these days, an amicable lawyer who is willing to offer Abel a legal defence and gives a CIA operative a mini-lecture on the need to honour ""the rule book"" that is the US Constitution.In effect, Donovan is the bridge between Abel and Powers and the film cleverly tells the spies'stories in parallel - two dedicated state servants who become lonely prisoners whose only physical connection is a few seconds passing one another on a snowy bridge without a word exchanged between them. Abel is played by the outstanding British actor Mark Rylance who, as he did in his portrayal of Thomas Cromwell on BBC television, ushers a laconic, wry and understated persona (although his accent rather wanders).It is a tribute to the sharp (and sometimes amusing) script - co-authored by British dramatist Matt Charmian - that, although we know how the mission will end, it is still a gripping tale. Thanks to cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, the film looks good with a lot of attention to period detail, but there are a couple of contemporary political messages here.The first is clear: in the face of a war (whether the cold war or the war on terror), we should not abandon our ""rulebook"" (that is, our protection of liberty). The other message might be unintentional: just as the East Germans build a wall and fortifications to prevent their citizens from seeking freedom and prosperity in the West, so Europe today - but notably not Germany itself - is erecting fences to present Syrian and other refugees from their efforts to flee another form of totalitarian rule.",,Anonymous,History
"Spielberg playing it safe and ""Bridge of Spies"" feels strangely subdued","""Bridge of Spies"" (2015 release; 141 min.) brings the story of how insurance lawyer Jim Donovan became involved in negotiating a prisoner exchange in Berlin between the US and the USSR. As the movie opens, we are told that it is ""1957, the height of the cold war"". We then follow someone in Brooklyn, who after a long chase sequence gets arrested for spying for the Russians. In order to make it look like the spy is getting due process and a ""fair shake"", the US government appoints a lawyer to represent him. Turns out to be NY insurance lawyer (and ex-Nurnberg assistant prosecutor) Jim Donovan. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest in series of historical ""inspired by true events"" movies from director Steven Spielberg, this time directing from a script by Matt Charman, Ethan Coen and Joel Coen (yes, THE Coen brothers). I had seen the trailer a number of times, and was expecting a riveting movie in line with earlier historical movies from Spielberg such as Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, and Munich. Alas, it was not to be. The movie lacks any tension whatsoever, and has the feeling of having been done strictly ""by the numbers"". The best scenes are when we get to Berlin, in the frantic days as the wall was being completed and people were desperate to get out of East Berlin. And the of course the climax of the movie, filmed on the real bridge of spies (the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, near Potsdam--I had the good fortune of visiting this site a few years ago, it gave me the chills walking on it). There are several noteworthy acting performances: Tom Hanks (in his 4th cooperation with Spielberg) as Jim Donovan, and Mark Rylance as the spy Rudolf Abel (great line: Donovan: ""you're not worried?"", to which Abel responds: ""would it help?"", ha!). As always with Spielberg, the production is terrific and authentic in to the smallest of details. Last but certainly not least: the orchestral score is, shockingly, NOT by John Williams, which I believe marks the first time in 40 years in a Steven Spielberg (the score is from Thomas Newman, who does a fine job). Bottom lime: I found ""Bridge of Spies"" strangely subdued and to me it feels like Spielberg played it safe in this one.""Bridge of Spies"" opened nationwide this weekend, and I couldn't wait to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay, but frankly I had expected a lot more people, given this is the movie's opening weekend. I have seen most of Spielberg's movies and as a long-time fan, must admit this to me feels like one of the weaker movies he's done in a long time. Is it bad? Of course not, but neither is it great. Nevertheless, this is of course a personal and subjective view, and I would encourage you to check out ""Bridge of Spies"", be it in the theater, on VOD or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A film of standing for what you believe in and negotiating!,"""Bridge of Spies"" is a thriller starring Tom Hanks that was set during the Cold War times which involved a rescue mission of a Soviet spy.

Dull and boring.,"This movie is long, stagy, pretentious and boring. The acting is hammy, and the characters are drab and inspire little interest. The tension should have been gripping. Instead it is absent. The ending of movie is already known and is anti-climatic. The movie seems to suggest that Abel was not treated fairly and downplays the seriousness of his crimes and the sinister nature of his work. The treatment of Francis Gary Powers is completely superficial, which makes the story even weaker. For an audience not familiar with the history surrounding Abel and Powers, this movie will not make any sense at all. This movie contains no heroes, heroines, no damsels in distress, none of the stock characters and situations usually employed to give a story some substance. Instead, the movie just plods along to its foregone conclusion. Why would any movie maker find such bland characters worthy of a movie? The real story is how the Soviets managed to shoot down an American spy plane flying at 70,000 feet. How the Soviets were able to detect and target a U2 flying at that altitude is not explained, nor is the huge political fallout caused by the Powers debacle even mentioned. Indeed, the names of Eisenhower and Khrushchev are absent, yet in the actual event they were the key players, and by leaving them out, there's no story.",3.0,Anonymous,History
An Excellent Movie that Poses an Interesting Moral Dilema,"Bridge of Spies is a fantastical movie and the second-best collaboration between Spielberg and Tom Hanks (Saving Private Ryan has to be #1). Bridge of Spies tells the real story of a lawyer who is called on to represent a Soviet Spy in the heart of the Cold War. Though much of the movie concerns a hostage exchange and is tense and interesting, I found the actual trial and ethical complications around the trial the most interesting. At the time, America was anticipating a nuclear war with the hated Soviets and the thought of representing the captured spy in court must have been a daunting one. The movie stands up for the Constitution and holds dear to American ideals that make the country the great nation it is.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent! Tom Hanks delivers once again,"After watching Sully, I went back to see some movies with Tom Hanks that I had skipped. Bridge of Spies was brilliant. The way in which a civilian, although a lawyer, was dragged into this whole thing and the way in which he handled it, was amazing and thrilling to watch.Mark Rylance was also breathtaking in his role as Rudolf Abel. The movie had a really nice plot behind it, amazing scenery and photography in general, and it did keep you at the edge of your seat. It was quite long, but still I felt like it could have used some extra time towards the end.My favorite moments were of course towards the end of the movie, when all loose ends are tied up one way or the other.

4) The opening half an hour and final half an hour are both mesmerisingNEGATIVES:1) The film is undoubtedly half an hour too long
2) It almost feels like two films wedged together; with the courtroom drama of the first 45 minutes quickly abandoned for the espionage thriller of the final 2 thirds

A Nice Movie with an engaging Plot,"The film is a historical drama set in 1957, the period of the Cold War. It was a time where spies were used extensively by US and the Soviets. Though I don't claim to be an expert about the Cold War and it's history, I thought that the story is presented with utmost honesty. This is one of those films which would inspire one to learn more about such historical events. The film turns out to be quite a thriller.Rudolf Abel is arrested by FBI on charges of being a Soviet Spy. A lawyer is provided, in order to ensure that justice is seen to be done. The lawyer, James Donovan, ignoring the fact that he was employed just for a formality, works with utmost sincerity in presenting Abel's case. He faces a lot of heat from public, family and his own firm. After some time, Francis Gary Powers who is a US pilot is captured by soviets. CIA, afraid that Powers might leak secrets, employees Donovan in helping them trade Powers with Abel. At the same time. Frederic Pryor, an American Student is unjustly held by Germans in suspicion of being a US spy. It turns into quite an adventure for Donovan as he tries to get both Pryer and Power for Abel.The story is quite close to the true course of events. Powerful performances by Tom Hank and Mark Rylance are some of the main features of this film. Spielberg does a wonderful job in presenting the characters. For a plot so rich and dense, I thought the film moves a bit slow and covers less ground.

Oddly lacking in thrills and tension,"Steven Spielberg's latest exercise in good ol' fashioned American wholesomeness, integrity and diplomacy transports us back to 1957, where undercover KGB agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is about to be busted by the FBI under suspicion of passing secrets onto the Soviets. The idealistic man at the centre of the story is James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer working in Brooklyn who joins the likes of John Quincy Adams, Oskar Schindler and Abraham Lincoln on the list of great, conflicted men caught up in a difficult period of upheaval and portrayed by Spielberg in an admiring light. And who better to play a man of such a clear sense of morality than Hollywood's favourite nice-guy Tom Hanks?Working with frequent collaborator Janusz Kaminski, Bridge of Spies is about a good-looking as a film gets. Infused with the same eye for detail and greyed-down solemnity of Lincoln (2012), the backdrops on show provide the perfect location for serious men talking serious business. The main crux of the film rests in the blossoming friendship between Donovan and Abel, who are captured on an equal par in a bleak interrogation room as the sun blazes through the blinds. These are two men from opposing sides, but share the share the same determination, stubbornness, and loyalty to the ideals of their country. Abel accepts his increasingly-likely execution as one of the requirements of his job, but Donovan wants to exercise his rights as a PoW, making himself public enemy number one in the process as his face splashes across the newspapers.Donovan also hopes to keep him as a tool should the need for a prisoner exchange rear its head in the future, which was incredible foresight for anyone who knows the true-life story. As Donovan fights for Abel in the courtroom, the United States are prepping their own mission - to send a spy plane over the Soviet Union to take photographs. Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is shot down and, after failing to swallow the cyanide given to him by his commanding officer in case he finds himself in such a perilous position, is taken prisoner by the Soviets and routinely tortured for information. The U.S. government again turn to Donovan in the hope of setting up an exchange just as American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) is also arrested.For a story so littered with intrigue and espionage, Bridge of Spies is oddly lacking in thrills and tension. When Donovan arrives for the exchange in Berlin as the Wall is being put in place, the city is hostile and seemingly lawless in areas, but instead the film focuses on the various bizarre characters, including a Petter Lorre- alike KGB man, who flock around Donovan, a man they simply do not know. Perhaps the unevenness in tone is down to a script-polishing by Joel and Ethan Coen, who never shy away from taking a genre and stamping their own particular brand of humour on it. Spielberg also cannot resist resorting to sentiment at the film's climax on the eponymous 'bridge of spies' (Glienicke Bridge). Still, this is Spielberg at his most professional, harking back to classic Hollywood while maintaining the relevance of the films themes.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Very disappointing,"I personally felt this film was not to my taste. I went in expecting a nice meaty courtroom drama. Turned out it was something else entirely. Something bereft of any drama at all, really. This film is about a man who faces numerous obstacles that he needs to overcome in order to do the right thing. The problem is that each time he comes across an obstacle turns out all he has to do is simply ask someone to remove it for him! And for some reason they do it for him! Every single time! He does this over and over again throughout the film. It's ridiculous. If he can simply ask for whatever wants then there is nothing at stake. There is never any tension.I wish I had not wasted my money. And I wish I had instead sat at home watching a tin of beans heat up in a microwave. And because everyone knows you can't put metal things in a microwave, it would have at least provided more drama and more tension than the entirety of this very long and very boring film.",2.0,Anonymous,History

Triumphant Approach,"Bridge of Spies centers a lawyer who gets involved on defending a Soviet spy during the Cold War, meanwhile an American pilot was captured from the Soviet Union after a failed infiltration mission; having both sides even. This can be called a war movie, except it takes place in another side of the war; where we see people making decisions, having negotiations and such; might be recalling Spielberg's last film, Lincoln. Though some people may not be fond of the similarity, Bridge of Spies however manages to bring more humor and excitement within this journey. The plot remains rigorous, yet finds some real humanity, anyway. There are many reasons to get hooked into this film; from the story to the craft, whether it's big or small, the entirety is just excellent.The opening is already impressive, having a wordless prologue showing what this Soviet spy does in his job, hidden behind his innocent mannerism and appearance. It's simple, but tense and catches your attention, filling you with intriguing questions about this man's work. And then we cut to James Donovan, played by Tom Hanks, who is supposed to help this spy who was just captured and becomes a notorious man for defending an enemy of the nation. But things get tougher when he gets on an espionage, and then there's more. Despite the plot goes through a lot of directions, it never gets tedious and that might be because it's brought with some levity and sharp writing. But of course, the movie is on point with its theme. Basically acknowledging that no one is particularly good or bad in this war, both nations are having the same struggle, except Donovan strives to represent his country better by not only defending their spy, but also defending his own nation's integrity.And ironically, the Soviet spy happens to have more empathy in this film compared to the American spy. He can still be a threat for handling information, but he is actually a quiet old man who isn't afraid of anything. And his small moments with Donovan are instantly winning, mostly by its profoundness. In the midst of people arguing how to retrieve back their spies as safely as possible, the viewers shouldn't be worried by a stick-in-the-mud plotting, because the film hints with subtle humor. But of course, there is some suspense to be seen, as well. The opening is just the most interesting for its sense of mystery; the rest of the set pieces are just tension of people probably getting into trouble.And these scenes won't be as effective if it weren't for Steven Spielberg himself. The smaller scenes are obviously gripping and given warmth when they needed to, while the larger ones have brimming spectacle. The overall imagery always look great due to its stunning cinematography. The Coen Brothers, as the co-writers of this film, can obviously be noticed by the film's levity and some subtlety, as well. The acting is all predictable, with Tom Hanks being terribly engaging as James Donovan, but the more notable actor, Mark Rylance, brings a less showy performance, yet given something more to his moments.Bridge of Spies is stellar, simply by its craft and how it straightforwardly retells this story. It doesn't necessarily try to heighten the stakes beyond than what's necessary, in which some viewers can be disappointed, but the movie offers something more earnest and riveting. There is still a fine dose of suspense, though it actually handles a variety of tones: there are moments of coldness, but there are also moments that lighten itself up; making each account quite affecting and most importantly, entertaining, in this case of these men finding better justice for saving each other's spies, during one of the toughest times in history. And it's all done much you would expect from these filmmaking and acting talents.",,Anonymous,History
Could not stop talking about it.,"Tom Hanks has always been excellent at bringing to life, unique, interesting, and inspiring characters. From his early days as a kid who magically grows up and has to deal with the adult world in Big and as a disabled young man in Forest Gump, Hanks has consistently charmed audiences with his strong performances and acting style. In his latest movie, Bridge of Spies, he does it again, promising and delivering yet another powerful performance of a completely different character. He plays an insurance lawyer who is chosen to defend an accused Russian spy during the Cold War. Hanks' performance shows off his remarkable talent as he shows viewers the many sides of his well rounded character. He is a father, a lawyer, an American, and in the end a friend to his client, as he works to bring a strong legal defense to and save the life of the accused man. He eventually works to be able to negotiate to return the prisoner to his family. With heartbreaking moments, fascinating political commentary, and compelling and true story this movie this movie will keep you talking long after the credits roll. Without giving anything away the scene near the end set on the bridge is especially powerful.The part of the story I found most interesting was the intense debate over what rights, if any, an accused person person who was not born in the United States should receive. As I watched the erosion of the rights of the accused I was reminded of a recent trial that, at least partially, revolved around a similar theme. What was important during the Cold War remains a concern as we face a shifting future of international politics and complicated international situations. Bridge of Spies is strong and powerful and is sure to be a crowd pleaser. My personal rating is ten out of ten. Please note that this is a reflection of my personal opinion, not paid for or influenced by any company affiliated with the movie Bridge of Spies and that, while I am a proud employee of a national movie theater chain the views and opinions expressed in this review are mine and not necessarily a reflection of the company where I work.

A flawed but interesting insight into Cold War tension,"Based on the true story of an American insurance lawyer who wound up negotiating spy exchanges during the Cold War, 'Bridge of Spies' does a sterling job depicting tensions and insecurities during one of the most volatile periods in US history. While the focus of the film is always the American lawyer, played by Tom Hanks, the film successfully weaves in several subplots that hint at what it was like to live during the Cold War. Most potently, the lawyer's son becomes obsessed with preparing for nuclear disaster after watching one too many propaganda films at school. Not so successfully woven in are two subplots involving the men who Hanks has to negotiate getting back in exchange for a captured Russian spy. The time-line of events in the film is also a little incredulous; no sooner has Hanks pleaded for the Russian's spy life to be spared in case of prisoner exchange is a prisoner exchange suddenly put on the table. Never to mind, Mark Rylance is superb as the Russian spy who hilariously keeps asking ""would it help?"" whenever Hanks asks him if he is worried. In fact, there is quite a bit of oddball humour in the film (Burghart Klaussner answering the wrong phone, etc), which can probably be chalked up to the Coen Brothers script. Furthermore, one of the film's strongest assets is how it balances light humour and very grim drama. As icing on the cake, the film looks superb with accurate period sets/costumes and lots of fluid, mobile camera-work from Janusz Kaminski. Thomas Newman provides an effective score too in lieu of John Williams.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Moody Film,"Sometimes, you go to the Cineplex to ""catch a flick"". Sometimes, you go to ""watch a movie"". And sometimes, if you're lucky, you are able to ""view a film"".BRIDGE OF SPIES is a film in every sense of the word.Directed by the great Steven Spielberg, BRIDGE OF SPIES tells the story of the Cold War prisoner exchange in the early 1960's that was brokered by the character portrayed by Tom Hanks . Taking his time telling this story in a script that was written by Matt Charman and punched up the the Coen brothers, Spielberg and Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski create a gray, grainy and, yes, cold world that accurately depicts the feelings of the time.Not only is Spielberg at the top of his game but so is Hanks in the lead role. He imbues lawyer James Donovan with strength courage and decency while also showing the fear of the unknown that permeates the movie and the Cold War times of the early '60's. It is Hanks best performance in quite some time and further cements him as one of the best actors of our generation.Spielberg, Hanks, Kaminski, Coen are all ""veteran"" movie names that show, yet again, that they know what they are doing and create a film/world that is interesting to look at and satisfying to experience. But it is relative film newcomer Mark Rylance, as Russian spy Rudolf Abel who steals the show. This veteran theater actor has a minimalist expressive face that shows more emotion in a raised eyebrow than most actors show in the entire performances. It is a memorable performance and one that I expect to see called out come Academy Awards time.If you are looking for an ""action"" spy movie - wait for the James Bond film that is coming out in a few weeks. If you are looking for a smart, atmospheric, well acted FILM that accurately depicts the mood, feeling and atmosphere of the Cold War, view BRIDGE OF SPIES.It's terrific.9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Safe bet in the Cold War.,"When a story needs to be told against the backdrop of a volatile world in the middle of the Cold War, who better to employ than a couple of silver screen legends in Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Add the storytelling brilliance of the Coen brothers and Hollywood has a sure fire winner when it comes to 'Bridge of Spies'. With recent tensions resurfacing between the United States and Russia it is appropriate timing that the big players in movie land have handed such a sensitive issue safely in the steady palms of four powerhouse individuals to deliver a movie inspired by real life events.But was it too safe? 'Bridge of Spies' was billed as a political thriller with dramatic historical undertones but I can't help feeling that this film has missed its mark in its desire to leave an impact on the audience. Spielberg has delivered a film that comfortably plays within its boundaries without giving the viewer the 'wow factor' that allows the audience to walk out of the theatre with a sense of content satisfaction. This is not to say that 'Bridge of Spies' is a bad film, I just believe with the talent available, it could have been better. The Coen brothers have written a story that was always going to be strong, intelligent and interesting but the narrative seemed stale and tired. 'Bridge of Spies' could have been written by any number of decent script writers. It would have been very difficult for Joel and Ethan to insert their edgy trademark into a story with a set path leaving me perplexed as to why they would have agreed to write the script that relied on rigid conformity.Tom Hanks is his reliable solid self as Insurance Lawyer, James B. Donovan who has the unenviable task of defending accused Russian spy, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). In 1957 at the height of the Cold War, America's distrust of anything communist is evident with Donovan's staunch morals and belief in his countries constitution is tested and his families safety is not guaranteed. With Abel's outcome a foregone conclusion it comes as surprise to many at the result in his trial. Sometime later, Donovan is given the opportunity to broker a deal in East Berlin to exchange Abel with an American pilot that had been shot down while taking photographs over Russian airspace. Hanks plays out his role without a hiccup, never really challenged by his character who could be a little too close to Hanks own personality but it is his solid unspectacular performance that allows Mark Rylance to shine. Rylance's calm, intelligent interpretation of a British national that has ties with the USSR bounces wonderfully off Hanks's presence and it becomes apparent that the two characters have a mutual respect for each other. Amy Ryan has a bit part as Donovan's wife, Mary, but doesn't get the chance to make a significant impact and Alan Alda has a cameo as James B. Donovan's boss, Thomas Watters Jr.Spielberg does give the audience an outstanding look into the recent past with a reconstruction of East Berlin. The wall has just been built and the infamous Checkpoint Charlie is brought back to life with disturbing images of desperate wall jumpers being mercilessly gunned down. An authentic contrast of conditions on either side of the wall adds some much needed tension to Donovan's negotiation's in an atmosphere where uneasy paranoia is just below the surface.At a little under two and a half hours, 'Bridge of Spies' strains the patience that the viewer puts into it believing that they are going to be given more than what they actually get. It's solid and it is safe but it is not brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Slow as death - felt like a MOW/Docudrama. Little substance and Boring!,"I am a big fan of Spielberg and really had high expectations for this film. However, it was so slow moving that if it was not for the director name and Tom Hanks I would have walked out of it. Yes, you read that correctly. There was really nothing moving about the movie and the over saturated directing made it even worse. The main few events were played over and over so much that the end of the story felt blaise. Great material and wonderful that it is a true story but it was the most shallow slow moving boring docudrama and I love history but I would not recommend or waste any money on this movie. I give it a 1 star and the worst movie Spielberg has made.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Riveting Story, Superb Cast, Solid Filmmaking on All Counts","Stephen Spielberg's riveting new film portrays the real-life events and personalities that led to a historic U.S.-Soviet-East German prisoner exchange in the frozen depths of the Cold War. In 1962, in a divided Berlin, an accused Soviet spy is to be traded for two Americans, if all goes well. An off-the-books U.S. negotiator has led the Soviets and the East Germans separately to the brink of agreeing the exchange, but hostilities are strong, motives are complex, and success is far from guaranteed. Based on the 2010 Giles Whittell book of the same name, the story centers around the intertwined fates of William Fisher, born Rudolf Abel, a British-born KGB agent whom the FBI arrested in New York; Francis Gary Powers, U.S. pilot of a super-secret U-2 spy plane shot down while flying over Russia; and Frederic Pryor, an American graduate student who finds himself on the wrong side of the new Berlin Wall and in the hands of the Stasi, East Germany's notorious secret police. Spielberg tells these men's stories, but centers on the role of U.S. insurance attorney James Donovan in the negotiations. Donovan's role initially is to defend Abel in his trial on espionage charges. He takes on this thankless task, even though everyone in the country, including the judge in the case, believes Abel is guilty. However, American legal processes need to be followed, if only to show the world that every prisoner receives a fair trial (an ironic punctiliousness half a century later). Inevitably, Abel is convicted, but at least Donovan persuades the judge not to invoke the death penalty. It's a controversial choice for Donovan to decide to appeal the verdict, and one that puts himself—and perhaps his family and career—in some danger. When Powers's plane is shot down, the possibility of a prisoner swap is immediately seized upon by the CIA. They want Powers back. He knows too much. Donovan is asked to negotiate an Abel-Powers trade, unofficially. What he encounters on all sides in Berlin is stubborn resistance salted with suffocating paranoia. He also hears about the unlucky American student and insists he be part of the deal, which the CIA rejects. They're not interested. The acting is terrific, especially Tom Hanks as Donovan and Mark Rylance as Abel. In smaller roles, the CIA agents and Soviet and East German negotiators are suitably opaque and blustering. Amy Ryan, Donovan's wife, is always excellent. They have the benefit of working from a strong script by Matt Charman, Ethan Coen, and Joel Coen. I particularly liked how, whenever Donovan asks Abel if he is worried about some particular outcome, Abel responds, ""Would it help?"" The look of the film is exactly right—cold, forbidding—and the Glienicke Bridge, site of the hoped-for exchange is a desolate place. Spielberg's handling of Donovan as ""the standing man,"" underscoring a metaphor introduced by Abel, works. If only he'd resisted a few message-heavy Hollywood touches (East Germans versus U.S. children scrambling over a wall, for example), it would have been perfect.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Great visuals as expected in a Spielberg film,"Spielberg's film is always a treat for the eye. He manages to recreate America and Europe of the ""cold war"" era with great aplomb. I defy anyone to find anachronistic errors in the visuals of the film. This film reunites the director with Tom Hanks. Hanks, who plays regularly this type of American who has integrity and honesty, and is driven by a strong sense of justice. He follows in the cinematic tradition of Gary Cooper and James Stewart, but does not add much to the genre, if only modernity.With a director so focused on the visuals, the depth of the characters remains deficient. Even a script signed by the Cohen brothers, amazingly did not help much. So I remained with the question: how does this fairly ordinary lawyer become so heroic in environments of hostile international intrigues.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A return to form for Spielberg,"I've been a huge fan of Spielberg for ages. Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, Minority Report etc. But the last few films haven't really done much for me. Crystal Skull really killed my enthusiasm for his films, and with the exception of Tintin, I haven't seen anything since that matches his best. But Bridge of Spies is a true return to form. Unlike Lincoln, which I thought was dull Oscar bait, Spies is a taut, exciting cold war thriller. John Williams provides another great score, the cinematography is excellent, and the film really captures the cold war paranoia and fear of those turbulent times. Parallels can be made between this film and the Bush administration, and at the same time not get bogged down in politics (Unlike the dry Amistad). This is a film that reminds people that the most exciting words on a movie poster are ""A Film by Steven Spielberg"".",9.0,Anonymous,History
Ultimately Unsatisfying,"Meticulous craftsmanship and production design are hallmarks of all Spielberg movies, and Tom Hanks is always a winner, but when the movie was all over I'm not sure how entertaining it was. Mark Rylance apparently got an Oscar for mumbling a lot and just looking sad, with his mouth turned down at the corners so severely I genuinely thought it was a prosthetic of some kind. But my biggest issue is the way the film depicts Soviet spy Abel as some kind of sympathetic hero, when he was an enemy of the United States and his activities clearly put American lives at risk. That seems unforgivable in a film posturing itself as historically accurate and left a sour taste in my mouth.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Would it help?,"Greetings again from the darkness. For a director, true power in the movie industry means you can obtain the financing and assemble the cast and crew you need to make the films that have meaning to you. With his 40 year career of unmatched combined box office and critical success, Steven Spielberg is the epitome of film power and the master of bringing us dramatized versions of historical characters and events. In his fourth collaboration with Tom Hanks, Spielberg tells the story of James B Donovan.You say you aren't familiar with Mr. Donovan? In the late 1950's and early 1960's, the CIA (Allen Dulles was director at the time) persuaded James Donovan to provide a bit of Cold War legal service. Mr. Donovan was by trade an Insurance attorney, but after others in his profession passed on the ""opportunity"", his commitment to justice and human rights drove him to accept the challenge of defending suspected Russian spy named Rudolph Abel. In the face of an angry populace and government, Donovan took the case all the way to the Supreme Court – and his exact words are spoken in the movie by Hanks.Not long after, Francis Powers (played by Austin Stowell) was piloting a CIA U-2 spy plane when he was shot down over Russia and taken captive. This sequence in the film is breathtaking to watch. Enter James Donovan again  this time to negotiate an exchange of prisoners: Rudolph Abel for Francis Powers. It's these negotiations that provide the element of suspense in the story. Mr. Donovan was a family man, but he was also very confident in his ability to negotiate on the biggest stage and under the brightest spotlight (or darkest backroom).The movie is exactly what you would expect from a master filmmaker. Spielberg re-creates the era through sets, locations, and costumes. He utilizes his remarkable eye behind the camera, an interesting use of lighting, and the score from Thomas Newman. Nope, that's not a misprint. It's the first Spielberg movie in 30 years not scored by John Williams (who was unable to work on the project). Of course, the cast is stellar and it all starts with Tom Hanks. He just makes everything look so darn easy! Whether he is talking to his wife (Amy Ryan), his kids (including Bono's daughter Eve Hewson), his law partner (Alan Alda), or agents from the U.S. or Russia  Hanks manages to make each scene real and believable.It's the scenes between Donovan and Rudolph Abel that are the most fascinating to watch. Mark Rylance plays Abel, and to see these two men grow to respect each other for ""doing their job"" is a true acting and screen writing clinic. We find ourselves anxious for the next Rudolph Abel scene during an extended span where the focus is on Donovan's negotiations. When the two finally reunite, it's a quietly affecting moment where much is said with few words.Spielberg utilized many of the locations where the actual events took place, and this includes Berlin and the Glienicke Bridge where the real exchange took place in 1962. While missing the labyrinth of twists and turns of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, it's knowing that these are real people in real situations that make this historic drama so thrilling and riveting to watch. Film lovers will also get a kick out of the fact that the script was co-written by the Coen Brothers, and history lovers will enjoy seeing some of the details provided by the written words of those involved, as well as their surviving family members. It's an era that seems so long ago, yet the topics are so pertinent to what's happening in the world today. Beyond all of that, it's a story of a man standing up for what's right at a time when that was not the easy or popular way.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Solid,"A solid piece of work by Spielberg and his collaborators. Tom Hanks, the James Stewart of our day, incarnates honourable American values but manages, in a way Stewart never would or probably could, to convey his awareness of their fragility. The business of holding fast to one's values in a challenging world is the spine of the film's message, dramatised in the relationship between spy Rudolph Abel and Hanks' character, lawyer James Donovan, in this tale of Cold War brinkmanship.Abel is played by someone who I have no hesitation in naming as one of our era's greatest actors: Mark Rylance. Very familiar to theatre audiences in the UK, he has appeared infrequently on screen. I have a feeling this situation is going to change as a result of his typically superb performance here. Watching him and Hanks play their scenes together was for me the film's main pleasure.Hanks is well partnered too in his scenes with Mikhail Gorevoy as a Russian diplomat and Sebastian Koch as an East German lawyer. Austin Stowell is excellently cast as Gary Powers, the American pilot whose capture reconfigures Abel's fate, and there are a number of other first rate cameos, including Peter McRobbie's turn as John Foster Dulles.The women have a rotten time. Amy Ryan has little to do but smile or worry as Hanks' wife. Nadja Bobyleva manages to make a mark with an emotional scene as the Berlin Wall is being built, one of the film's most chilling sequences.The film's stand-out sequence on the technical front is a terrifying plane crash, one of those jaw-dropping set-pieces that are hallmarks of a Spielberg movie. In this story there's not much room for another of those hallmarks - sentimentality - but where Spielberg can find it - mainly in the scenes around Hanks' family - he puts it in.Still and all, it's definitely worth going to see BRIDGE OF SPIES, not least for Rylance's masterclass in screen acting.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Spielberg is Back - Not that He Ever Went Away,"It's easy to get caught up in the magnificent acting performances of this film's phenomenal international cast. Of course you expect Tom Hanks to put his usual Oscar-worthy skills on display, and he does in scene after scene. But everyone in the supporting cast is equally as memorable, not to mention Mark Rylance, who is one of the most talented actors many people may not recognize or even be familiar with. It's also easy to get caught up in the beautiful, period cinematography, locations and sets in Bridge of Spies. The look and feel of both early 1960's America plus the depressing starkness of East Berlin during the escalation of the Cold War are depicted perfectly.But what came through to me more than any of these individual pieces is the unsurpassed storytelling skills of Steven Spielberg. Not only does he get one of the best performances out of Hanks in his entire career, but his attention to detail and nuance is utterly amazing. When Hanks is confused, Spielberg makes sure you are as well. When he's feeling anxious or paranoid, the director makes you equally as apprehensive. But he does this with visual cues, glances, hints and a marvelous musical score.This is cinema at its purest and its best. Dialog is less important than the visuals, but the script is tight, crisp and taught. Nothing is wasted. In a season when there have been a great many outstanding films to hit the screen (Mr. Holmes, Black Mass, Everest) Bridge of Spies is a must-see for anyone who loves a well-told story that will make you wonder how two hours can fly by so quickly.",10.0,Anonymous,History

James Donavan(hanks) plays the the perfect joker in the negotiations and his bluffs do pay off at the end. Mr. Hanks played the character amazingly well and the story being a real one will give chills about what it was to live back then in the East/west Germany. Having said so, the direction seemed pretty average. For a man like Spielberg,I expect more. But,then again, maybe there lies the charm.

"In ""Bridge of Spies"", Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks bring us a 1st Class historical drama.","A friend of mine recently posted on Facebook that his daughter had asked him who played the character called Hawkeye. ""Alan Alda,"" was my friend's reply, thinking of the surgeon on TV's ""M*A*S*H"". But my friend's daughter was asking about the Marvel Comics character in the ""Avengers"" films (played by Jeremy Renner). Besides amusing me, that little story got me thinking about how I was going to write my review of Steven Spielberg's historical drama ""Bridge of Spies"" (PG-13, 2:21). If I'm going to discuss a movie in which ""The U-2 Incident"" plays such a big part, it might be a good idea to point out that this reference has nothing to do with ticket scalping at a rock concert or anything of the sort. In fact, to better appreciate this review and, more importantly, Spielberg's film, you might want to do what I just did – reinforce and add to your historical knowledge of the aforementioned Cold War crisis, the Hollow Nickel Case and Rudolf Abel, Francis Gary Powers and James Donovan. Or you could just read my review and then go to the film, not just for a great cinematic history lesson but to see one terrific movie.Tom Hanks stars as James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer in the 1950s. Donovan is smart, honest, hard-working and, most importantly, he has principles and integrity – especially when it comes to the law. He has also served his country in uniform and assisted in the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the post-World War II Nuremberg Trials. Donovan's law firm's senior partner (played, coincidentally, by the same Alan Alda mentioned in my previous paragraph) asks him to accept the thankless task of defending accused Soviet spy, Rudolf Abel (multiple Tony Award winner Mark Rylance).Donovan is understandably less than enthusiastic about all of this, but his sincere belief that ""everyone deserves a defense"" leads him to take the case. In spite of (and because of) his patriotism, he represents this obviously guilty spy as zealously and ethically as he represents all his clients. In the vehement and almost universal anti-communism of 1950s America, Donovan runs down every ground ball, making him one of the most hated men in America – and even endangering his family. His wife (Amy Ryan) supports him throughout the case, but she has some trouble understanding the lengths that he goes to for Abel.Fast-forward a few years. Abel is still in prison, and Donovan brings him a letter supposedly from his wife in the U.S.S.R. The letter amounts to a back-channel proposal from the Soviets to discuss trading Abel for recently captured U-2 spy plane pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). C.I.A. director Allen Dulles personally asks Donovan to negotiate the swap – but as a private citizen, NOT as a representative of the U.S. government. Telling his wife he's going on a business trip to London, Donovan heads to East Berlin, just as the politically divided city is being physically divided by the construction of the Berlin Wall.With a C.I.A. employee (Scott Shepherd) briefing and supporting him, but needing to otherwise keep his distance, Donovan begins his dangerous mission. Navigating check points and a street gang, he walks alone from West to East Berlin for an appointment inside the Soviet embassy. He meets unofficially with another man to, as Donovan says, ""have the conversation that our governments can't"". Further complicating an already tenuous negotiation is Donovan's personal decision to insist that the prisoner swap include an innocent American university student recently detained by East German authorities. Clearly, it's going to take every ounce of Donovan's intelligence, skill and nerve to accomplish his objectives, not the least of which is avoiding getting shot or even detained and put on trial himself.""Bridge of Spies"" is that rare movie that can make history come to life and give it the immediacy of a first-class cinematic drama/thriller. Of course, there are those (as two people behind me in the theater seemed to do) who will walk out of a movie if it isn't very quickly filled with explosions, murders or at least a good chase scene, but short-sighted individuals like that miss an opportunity to enjoy the artistry of well-crafted stories that, sadly, are not as common as they used to be. This entire cast is exceptional, especially Hanks, who is as at the top of his game in full-on thinking man's ""boy scout"" mode, and Mark Rylance who deserves significant awards season recognition and, of course, the always impressive Ryan.I should mention that the Cold War intrigue highlighted in the film's trailers is all in the second half of the film, but the script, co-written by Matt Charman and none other than Ethan and Joel Coen, is smart and compelling throughout. That story, coupled with Spielberg's expert touch, impressively recalls a time and tone that few Americans still remember, while giving us the twin dramas of a Soviet spy in the U.S. and a downed U.S. pilot in the Soviet Union. These two tales are seamlessly woven together and perfectly edited. The film also reminds us that what makes all of us Americans are not the political or religious beliefs we hold, but the principles we all stand for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is as American as apple pie and about as rewarding an experience as anyone, regardless of nationality, could hope a film to be. ""A""",9.0,Anonymous,History
Oscar stuff,"Hanks plays lawyer and former counsel for the OSS who represents Soviet spy Rudolph Abel on espionage charges, and is then asked to broker a deal permitting Abel to return to Russia for the release of Francis Gary Powers, captured U-2 spy plane pilot. I have a natural distrust of Spielberg, most recently from the fictional War Horse, for being overly manipulative with his audiences. I have checked the basic facts behind this movie and they appear legit. If the movie was confirmed on a few other points I would give this a 10 without reservation. Sorry, for me historical movies (and particularly Biblical movies) need to be accurate - subtle deviations from the truth can (to me) create false impressions. As it is Hanks and Rylance (as Abel) are just superb, Hanks seems made for Spielberg's sort of movies. The period work is very impressive and cinematography superb. The story starts slowly but once things get going it moves along very well. This has the feel of Oscar work, just an impressive movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History

They both give Oscar-worthy performances and make you actually care for the characters. Also, the writing is excellent. Most of the movie is people talking and negotiating so it could've been boring. Fortunately, the writing keeps the story really interesting and engaging. The direction and musical score were also fantastic. My only problems with the movie is that it is a little slow, mainly in the first half. Also, it doesn't have that re-watchability so I can't really see myself watching it again.

One of the most fascinating Cold War thrillers you'll ever see,"Steven Spielberg's vast body of work has been hit-and-miss for me. While he's always been a technically brilliant filmmaker, he sometimes falls too much into mainstream territory, directing films that undeniably entertain but fall short when seen from an artistic point of view. However, when he's on point, his films are absolutely breathtaking. Bridge of Spies certainly falls under this category, although I might be slightly biased simply because I'm a Cold War buff. Based on the real-life incident, we follow lawyer James Donovan, who ends up negotiating the exchange of Soviet spy Rudolf Abel for American pilot Francis Gary Powers in Berlin during the early 1960's.Ever since reading Don DeLillo's incredible postmodern novel Libra, I've been fascinated by the U-2 spy planes and the capture of American pilot Francis Gary Powers. In a part of the novel, DeLillo describes, in disturbing political realism, the capture and interrogation of the pilot after his U-2 plane was shot down over Soviet territory. Now, in Bridge of Spies, Spielberg dramatises this important moment in history with terrifying realism.While not overtly violent, the film manages to disturb the viewer through the impeccable set design, cinematography and Spielberg's typically brilliant direction. Soviet spies lived and spied on Western nations, most notably the USA and the UK, while American and British spies lived and spied on Soviet Russia, during a time of extreme political paranoia. With the world on the potential verge of World War III, James Donovan (Tom Hanks) uses his legal knowledge in order to prevent a massive wave of violence. Hanks gives a predictably strong, professional performance as Donovan while British actor Mark Rylance steals the screen for his supporting role as Rudolf Abel.Spielberg is old-school Hollywood. His films feature the theatrical musical flourishes found in 40's and 50's Hollywood classics, American sentimentality and patriotism, and well-staged action and direction. His craftsmanship is undoubtedly excellent and this film shows why he's one of Hollywood's most successful and popular filmmakers, and Bridge of Spies is one of his best films. But we can't forget another filmmaking double, the Coen brothers, who co-wrote the film and deserve a mention for their well-written screenplay. It is a tense and exciting political thriller, and also a fascinating account of one of the most important, but also somehow forgotten, moments in Cold War history.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Adding To Spielberg's Amazing Collection Is....,"Bridge of Spies is directed Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks as James Donovan, an American lawyer that, in Cold War era 1957, is chosen to defend a captured Soviet spy named Rudolf Adel (Mark Rylance) in a court of law. He later is selected to negotiate a swap of sorts to trade Mr. Adel to the Soviets in exchange for an imprisoned American pilot, Francis Powers (Austin Stowell). This film is based off of a true story, and is truly one of the best films of 2015. I'm glad it's nominated for best picture.The best thing this movie offers is the directing. Very few films are directed perfectly, and this is absolutely one of them. The camera angles Spielberg utilizes are fantastic, and his ability to capture a whole conversation in just one shot is magnificent. The cinematography is also great. The cinematographer (Janusz Kamiński) did amazing at capturing the Cold War era, and the flips in between Germany and the United States are very distinguishable and impressive.On the contrary, the movie is long, and has about 2% rewatchability. Much like Spielberg's 1993 film, Schindler's List, the movie is a one or two time watch, and may be a two hour-thirty minute snooze-fest for action lovers. Anybody who comes to this movie expecting James Bond espionage will surely have a good nap. However, a film lover and admirer of the art of cinema will be on the edge of his seat.The acting is also great. Tom Hanks gives an amazing performance, as always, yet not very memorable, unlike Forrest Gump or Captain Miller (Saving Private Ryan). His character won't be remembered in twenty years or so, no matter the status that the film ascertains. However, Mark Rylance gives the performance of his career. Besides Stallone, Rylance is most qualified to acquire the Oscar. The only performance I really had a problem with was that of Amy Ryan in the role of Mary Donovan (James' wife). She didn't exactly do bad, but her ability to portray her disagreement with her husband in dealing with his defense of a Soviet spy.The main problem I had with this movie is everything having to do with the American spy, throughout the first 45 minutes or so of the film. It takes away from the intensity going on with Hanks' and Rylance's characters. Every time something suspenseful was happening, the film would switch over to Power's side of the story, which wasn't too interesting. His scenes were directed well, and acted well, so the blame goes to the jumpy script, although the Coen brothers (yeah, they wrote a serious movie) ultimately did well once the second act rolled around, and lifted the film up pretty high.The last thing I'll mention is the score. This is the first Spielberg movie in many years that is not composed by John Williams, and it shows. However, that's not a bad thing. This film has a really good score, and keeps the suspense up, in a style Williams doesn't often use. Not to criticize Williams; he's the best film composer working today, but the score is captured beautifully by Thomas Newman, this film adding to his collection of many other great films he's scored, such as The Shawshank Redemption (1994) and American Beauty (1999).Overall, Bridge of Spies is a great movie with a few nitpicky problems here and there. The acting is good, the script is good, and the directing is flawless. I'm going to give Bridge of Spies an A-, or a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Classy film,"I have to confess to knowing very little about Bridge of Spies before the opening credits rolled. Going from the title and Tom Hanks presence was expecting a thriller, but it's actually a docu drama. The film tells the tale of events from the cold war. Like most docu dramas it suffers from the need to spice up a few of the real life events, but judging from other comments on the web most of the main plot lines are true.Hanks plays James B Donovan who is a lawyer hired to defend a Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). The film is always at it's best with the interplay between Donovan and Abel. A few of the scenes could probably have been dealt with a little more harshly in editing. As ever Hanks is always very watchable though, so it's certainly well worth a watch and gives a sense of what life was like during the cold war.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Every scene that takes places in West Berlin and East Berlin and what follows was enthralling and a delight to watch. The entire film is basically negotiations, posturing and dialogue.

"A nice, old fashioned thriller that could have done with a bit more bite","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAt the height of the Cold War, suspected Soviet informant Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) is captured, and is due to stand trial. Idealistic lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) agrees to represent him, at a great personal cost to himself and his family. But as the situation escalates, and casualties start being taken on the Russian side, it builds to a dramatic settlement outside the courtroom that will test both sides.Hanks and Spielberg are almost like their own company, obviously an effective partnership that has produced a number of high quality, epic productions over the years. The first thought bound to run through your mind when you see the latest offering from them is: what can go wrong? And so, the third film in a row I've reviewed that's been about spies unravels before me. Artistically, it's everything you'd expect on the tin, two seasoned professionals doing their thing and delivering the goods. In the end, though, it's just a bit too under-whelming to be great.In a day and age of relentless, flashy, fast paced CGI spectacles, it is refreshing to see such an intelligent and intricate story up on the big screen, taking its time to unfold and present all the facts. The drama itself does need to be pretty compelling, though, and sadly Bridge of Spies doesn't always maintain the most exciting pace. Hanks himself is serviceable, but hardly gives the most stirring performance of his career. But then, the trailer promised a dramatization of a man who risks losing everything, whose endurance and sanity are pushed to the very limit, but the script just never really delivers this, just a slow, plodding trot to the end, so he hardly finds himself stretched.It's an undeniably well made, intelligent and generally involving affair, if you're willing to pay attention, it just could have done with a little more meat on the bones underneath. ***",7.0,Anonymous,History
A really good story that could have been a really good movie if done by anyone else.,"What is it about Spielberg? He has turned into the King of the Banal. Or perhaps he was always thus? Except for Jaws maybe?But let's start with the GOOD stuff first. First off, I'm okay watching a Spielberg movie because I know he's not going to be using HAND- HELD throughout the movie. I seriously appreciate the camera work of people like Spielberg or Wes Anderson because I know I don't have to take Dramamine to watch their stuff.Secondly, Rylance probably deserved his Oscar. He's so mysterious. You always want to know what is going on with that guy! I just loved his fake befuddlement near the beginning of the movie when the CIA bust in on him. Great stuff.Third - Hanks. Tom Hanks does a bang up job giving this character real humanity. He turns him into a real person...as much as he can, since there is not much of a real person in the way the character was written. Another one of Spielberg's stalwart heroes. Dull as dishwater - except for the fact that Hanks wrestles the human being out of the flat script.So now onto the stuff that bugs me - let's start with the ending. Seriously, this movie could have ended 10 minutes earlier. Why oh why does S.S. have to always put those crappy endings on his movies? Hero comes home to wide-eyed adoring wife and/or children. And I'm a bit tired of these cypher-like, no-personality wives in these stupid movies.Was the wife really part of the story? No, so it is not necessary to cram that character in there being all 50s wife-ish and yelling about what it's all DOING TO THE FAMILY and all that other trite crap. Since no women were actually involved in this story - historically - it's OKAY to not try to shoehorn a female character into it. We women won't get all offended! We'd much prefer you just leave out the doting wife crap altogether. And leave the precocious interactions with the son out too, please. Why is this stuff always in an S.S. movie? Every. Damn. Time.Was there a point to having Alan Alda show up for 5 minutes to be a dick? And why set up this whole thing with the young man who was going to assist Donovan with the case and then the character just...disappears. Could S.S. cast someone even REMOTELY interesting to play Powers? And was all of New York really all reading the same newspaper and staring Donovan down on the subway? I really hate these dumb, made-up movie scenarios. Finally, nobody ever shot up Donovan's house. You really lose your credibility when you spice up the truth with bull-dooky incidents.(As long as we are on that vein...did people in the late 50s/early 60s watch as much television as the family in this movie does? Wouldn't the little ones be outside playing stickball? Wouldn't the teen girl be up in her room playing 45s?)It wasn't torturous to watch this movie. But it was just a movie. What it mostly did was spur you onto the internet to read about the real people and the real incidents. But as you are sitting and watching and getting curious about ""the real story"" you will find yourself rolling your eyes a lot.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Hanks and Spielberg bring out the best in one another yet again,"Bridge of Spies marks the fourth collaboration between director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks, a relationship that has gone extremely well thus far. Both of these Hollywood icons seem to bring the best out of each other and all things were pointing towards Bridge of Spies being another winner.Telling the story of James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer who, during the Cold War, is told he will be the defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) in court, a man believed to be a Soviet spy.When the American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), is shot down and imprisoned by the Soviet Union, Donovan is then tasked with negotiating an exchange with the Soviets; Powers for Abel at a time when tensions were very high between the two nations.Spielberg is my favourite director and he will go down as one of the greatest storytellers in the history of cinema. Whether he's dealing with a summer blockbuster or a lower budget drama, Spielberg finds a way for the film to connect with its audience, and Bridge of Spies is no different.The sentimentality that can so often be found in a Spielberg film is usually the key component in that connection and it is ever present in Bridge of Spies, a film that depicts an event in history made possible by one honest man when some thought war was the only option.There were some rewrites carried out on the script, written by Matt Charman however, when you can call upon the likes of Joel and Ethan Coen to spruce it up a bit, you know you are going to get real quality. Every word feels like it counts and there were some genuine moments where I was thinking to myself, ""Yeah, these are the words of the Coen Brothers"", with dashing of light humour sprinkled throughout.Coming to the performances, there were two that, unsurprisingly, stood out for me. Of course, Tom Hanks is one of them, playing the spirited Donovan with a performance full of such wit and charm that he becomes instantly likable and a character the audience will be rooting for.The other is the performance from the lesser known Mark Rylance, an actor known more for his stage roles than his work in front of a camera. As accused spy Abel, Rylance shares a chemistry with Hanks that sees Donovan and Abel seem more like old friends than strangers who have just met. Spielberg was so impressed with Rylance that he offered him the lead part in his upcoming adaptation of The BFG, due next year.Weirdly, for a Spielberg film, the score was not composed by John Williams, who had to drop off the project due to bad health. Thomas Newman stepped up to the plate and, while he does a fine job, his score doesn't do enough to evoke the emotions the way a score from John Williams would.This isn't Spielberg showing off with a big special effects laden film, nor is it a film about spies that you may expect. Bridge of Spies is however, a riveting drama with two Hollywood icons in top form. You'd be crazy not to check it out.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An amazingly engaging historical representation,"Bridge of Spies stars Tom Hanks as the real-life lawyer James B. Donovan, who must defend the captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Directed and produced by Steven Spielberg, who has directed and produced many war-time films (such as Saving Private Ryan, War Horse and Schindler's List) he sets this film during the bleak conditions of the Cold War, just as the Berlin War completes construction.Bridge of Spies employs fantastic acting from all cast members, especially Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, who emit a strong yet realistic sense of camaraderie and friendship due to their, at first, mutual relationship which develops into a bond so tight that the audience doesn't want it to be broken. The film also manages to contrast image and words, which work brilliantly, such as every scene where Tom Hanks is on a train, where no words are spoken, but one hundred ideas are broadcasted via the strong emotional face of Tom Hanks. These Grade-A performances as well as the completely differing settings of the two halves of the film, perfectly execute the mood integral for this serious, often heart-tugging moments. As mentioned, the scenery is gorgeous, with frequent switches of location; from America to Berlin and back, the location/cinematography greatly enhances the atmosphere of this film as do the uncoverings of background characters emotions and feelings towards Hanks' character such as a random policeman he meets, all questioning him: ""Why are you defending that traitor?"", revealing to the audience the side some must take for their country.Overall, the film is magnificent with perfect performances, a contrasting climate (from sun to snow) and the nuanced characters makes Bridge of Spies a fantastic film with strong underlying morals and values which still apply to this day.",,Anonymous,History
Dry but Spielberg puts his stamp on it,"It's so nice to watch a director who's completely in charge of whatever it is he's making. Even if the end product isn't perfect or to your liking, you can still appreciate that you are watching a master of his craft at work. Steven Spielberg will always be one of those directors. It helps he always works with an incredible team and has amazing actors at his disposal to direct, but the fact remains his name alone is always a stamp of quality. 'Bridge of Spies' isn't perfect, I have very little interest in the Cold War, the story itself within the war did very little for me, and yet it was an absolute pleasure to watch. A sure sign of class.The film has been nominated for Best PIcture at the Academy Awards. I think the nomination surprised some as it wasn't Spielberg's finest work, and it was missing some of the ""neccessaties"" when it comes to getting a nod, like a compelling love story (you could say there was one but you'd be stretched to do so). Films that are considered lucky to get a nomination are never any shot of actually winning the award, as they are just supposed to consider themselves lucky to be there in the first place. So sadly you won't be seeing 'Bridge of Spies' take home the award. A well deserved nomination nonetheless.Also nominated for Best Actor in a Supporting Role is Mark Rylance. Rylance blew me away. He has an amazing ability to appear as though he's not trying in the least bit, and yet at the same time completely steal a scene - even from the likes of Tom Hanks. The Coen Brothers, along with Matt Charman, wrote some terrific and Oscar worthy dialogue for him to deliver admittedly, but it was no doubt him that brought those words to life. Everyone is going to have a tough time knocking Sylvester Stallone off his perch for the award this year but if anyone can do it I believe it's Rylance.The only thing really holding it back from being great is that it's a touch dry. I never felt any emotion towards any character throughout the entire film. That, along with the fact that there is very little humour anywhere in the mix, can make it a tough watch at times. The quality though makes it worth the price of admission. Nothing is done half-heartedly, the sets are astonishing, even set on the actual bridge the events happened on. Hanks is his usual charismatic self and Rylance is in masterful form in every scene he's in. It's probably not one Spielberg will be most remembered for when we look back in 50 years, but I'm certain he'll still be proud to have it on his résumé.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Lots of things going for it, but should have been more nuanced.","So little was needed to make this a fantastic movie. The story itself is great, the insurance lawyer ending up way over his head, but approaching it with perfect calm. The mysterious spy. THe tension of the cold war. And the people involved in making this movie are also fantastic. From the Coens, to Hanks, Spielberg and so on. The movie looks good, and the actors do a good job.It seems like they tried to make a movie that is a bit more nuanced than good versus evil, where the characters aren't just black or white, but complex moral beings. But it doesn't really succeed. I like the way they explore the act all of the nations has to put up, and how all of them blunders, but do try to avoid war. But at the same time, the movie does not take the time to show the East Germans and the Russians as more than narrow minded. It was a terrible situation, and it should not be excused, but even a big movie like this should try to do justice to the (very real) people who lived back then, on all sides of the conflict. Much like Donovan does, in the movie.The movie is somewhat split into two, and the first part is definitely the best.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Solid in all areas and does exactly what it sets out to do!,"First off I had no idea going into this film that it wasn't a traditional Spielberg/John Williams collaboration. So it is testament to Thomas Newman's sheer brilliance and style that as the credits came, the first thing I turned and said to my partner was 'I could swear this score sounds like Thomas Newman, but obviously it's Spielberg so I'd imagine it's John Williams'. In fact on viewing the credits it turned out I was right and Spielberg has collaborated with another composer for the first time in 30 years! And what a brilliant soundtrack it is! Already far and away my favourite composer it's about time Thomas Newman won an Oscar. Given that he's done Spectre as well this year, fingers crossed it's his time!As for the film itself, yes the soundtrack is the best thing about the movie but that doesn't mean to say the film isn't good. It's very good, and delivered exactly what it should - a fascinating story delivered well and with solid acting performances. Hanks is great as usual and his character is brilliant! The set design is excellent and very true to the era (across 3 different countries). All in all it does exactly what it's supposed to, not ground-breaking, unlikely to be award winning, but a solid film... Think Lincoln, but more thrilling, less 'dull historic scenes'. One thing's for sure, it's certainly a step up from War of the Worlds!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Spielberg takes on the Cold War,"So after sharks, dynos, extra-terrestrials, WWII, Holocaust, Olympics terrorism, future, Lincoln and handful of other themes, it's the turn of the Cold War to be processed, re-created and brought to screen in the vision of Steven Spielberg. 'Bridge of Spies' inspired by the historical character of James B. Donovan, defender of the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel and then main negotiator in the spies exchange that set him free for the US pilot Gary Powers downed while in a mission over the USSR, is also the first movie in the political thriller genre directed by Spielberg.Had the script of this film been written by Ken Follett or the late Robert Ludlum, I would probably have accepted much easier the outcome. However, when brothers Coen are two of the three authors of the script I would have expected more than a smooth narrative structure and well written dialogs (in many moments). There is almost nothing of the sparks or daring insolence of many of the scripts in the films directed by the two. The story is roughly divided into two parts, and the tentative to synchronize the two threads (Abel's story and Powers' story) fail not only because they were separated in time by five years but also because it is only the first that has interesting material and consistency. The lawyer who does the right thing defending the rights of a criminal who presumably caused harm to his own country in time of what some perceived as war is too gross an analogy to the contemporary fight against terror viewed from a liberal point of view. The second part is more like the classical East Berlin spy stories, but here again the schematic description of East Berlin and of the Eastern German policemen and even officials lacks authenticity and complexity.We are left with enjoying two formidable performances by Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan and especially by Mark Rylance and Rudolf Abel. I am looking forward to the nominations for the Academy Awards and I hope that Rylance will get at least an Actor in a Supporting Role nomination. His act here is my favorite from all 2015 movies I have seen until now. On the other hand the political messages that this film tries to convey are much too obvious. Yes, they are important, but important messages are not well served when the style gets that close to propaganda. Actually the genre this film is closer than other is the Western. One lonely hero fights for justice against the whole world and wins against all odds. It's just that the century is the 20th and the hero is not using his gun, but is a lawyer. Problem is that the analogy does not work very well in this recent film of Spielberg.",6.0,Anonymous,History
the government propaganda of individual patriotism mars the film,"Steven Spielberg's 27th feature film is a superiorly constructed retro-pigmented Cold War drama, inspired by the real-life happening of a prison exchange among USA, USSR and GDR in 1957, a fourth collaboration with Hanks, who plays our hero James B. Donovan, a New York lawyer, who is firstly appointed to defend a KGB spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance), and later, he is entrusted by CIA in negotiating the release of the American pilot Francis Gary Powers (Stowell), who is captured by Soviet Union during his spy mission, in exchange of Abel, which will be held in East Germany. Meanwhile an American graduate student Frederic Pryor (Rogers) has been arrested as a spy by GDR government, but in fact, he is innocent, out of his righteousness, James wants to change the 1-for-1 swapping to 2-1, insist both Powers and Pryor should be released, where CIA's only interest is Powers, so will everything turns out as James hopes?Spielberg sensibly enacts a more true-to-life depiction of the espionage activity in the movie's slick opening, from the Hollow Nickel Case, Abel is introduced as a phlegmatic and practised old- hand, who can steadily erase the evidence while FBI is rummaging his room, and Mark Rylance, a UK thespian, whose theatre achievement is overwhelmingly distinguished, proves that he can upstage Hanks without steeping into theatrics, his portrayal of Abel as a docile, reasonable and undaunted figure leaps out to be the takeaway of the entire movie, with his offhand epigram towards James' impromptu questions like ""are you afraid?"" or ""are you worried?"". ""Does it help?"" shows his much prepared devotion to his dangerous cause, which is also the reason why he is able to win over James' admiration.Hanks acts in his very comfort zone, being an overall good guy, like his previous effort in Paul Greengrass' CAPTAIN PHILLIPS (2013), his goody-goody persona, aka, a standing man, has become quite weary, this is where dwells my major beef about the film, the script (with Coen brothers on board) conveniently establishes James as a textbook example of safeguarding the basic human rights without mining into his own inner struggle, as if from the very first moment, he is set about to be the unyielding fighter, against all odds of being the public enemy No. 2 to defend a so-called traitor, even after his own house being attacked, there is no single doubt ever flicking over his complexion about whether he should proceed this taxing case. More excruciatingly, he is also the one who miraculously persuades the jingoistic judge Byers (Matthews) from making a death penalty verdict to Abel by foretelling a possible prisoner-exchange would benefit from keeping Abel alive, and single-handedly accomplishes the tough deal without any assistance (he cannot even stay in the Hilton hotel) in Berlin. Everything tastes like an in-your-face American government propaganda of individual patriotism and the tropes are rather banal and a bit disappointing from Spielberg and co., e.g. the intentional juxtapositions of two disparate treatments of captives between USA and USSR, and an overlong shot of the hand of the GDR lawyer Vogel (Koch) after being denied for a handshake after delivering Pryor.But then, fairly speaking, the film is a stunning accomplishment from the production team and a captivating political drama which reflects the highest quality of Hollywood filmmaking presently, nominated for 6 Oscars this year, apart from BEST PICTURE and BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY, the other four are well-grounded (BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR for Rylance, BEST ORIGINAL SCORE, SOUND MIX and PRODUCTION DESIGN), but one might highly suspect it will go home empty- handedly.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Standard moral and thematic inclusions can't disturb a film largely built on meditative quietness,"Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" opens in a quiet, almost meditative manner, giving us a sense of the hustle in 1957 Brooklyn during the brutal Cold War. Spielberg focuses on movements of characters and slow, melodic buildup that results in a shockingly peaceful opening, giving what we can foresee will occur. We then cut to a man named Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), who retrieves a secret message in public before he returns to his apartment to be apprehended by FBI agents believing he is a Soviet spy.Subsequently, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), a lawyer who specializes in insurance settlements, is requested to take the case and serve as Abel's defense. The difficultly in the forthcoming legal battle is to ensure that Abel gets a fair trial, despite relations with Russian boiling like an unattended pot on a hot stove. Also during this time is the famous U-2 incident, where an American spy plane was shot down by Soviets and resulted in the death of Pilot Gary Powers (Austin Stowell). As a result, Donovan must now go to the USSR in order to try and sanction an exchange for Abel's safe return to his homeland for Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), an economics professor who was arrested under suspicion of being a spy during the construction of the Berlin Wall.The first half of ""Bridge of Spies"" is so quiet and low-key that it's almost a marvel of some sort. Spielberg further proves himself to be a delicate artist, with a gentle, liberal hand for long takes and intimate settings that build relationships with characters through tight, formal structures. Working with his longtime cinematographer Janusz Kamiński, Spielberg gives this film a classic-film look, almost echoing the dark and brooding sentiments of Hanks' overlooked ""Road to Perdition."" This film feels like a Cold War-era film about a forgotten piece of the era, thanks to its emphasis on classic set decoration and Spielberg's directorial artistry.The second half of ""Bridge of Spies,"" however, opts for an approach more grounded in what you'd expect from this kind of a film: talky setups, moral conveniences, and a more linear A-to-B plot structure instead of the fascinating ambiguity and meditative qualities a Spielberg film like ""Lincoln"" or ""Munich"" maintained throughout their entire runtimes. During this latter half of the film - which admittedly doesn't cripple it - even with the film's scope extended to a more international level, we still zero in on the fine performance by Tom Hanks, who further proves that pairing him with Spielberg can almost do no wrong.Hanks plays a character conflicted because of oppressive times to the point where some may find it difficult to see ""the big deal"" behind defending a Soviet spy on American soil. The moral ideas about following through with due process and a fair trial, while pretty standard and predictable for anyone who paid attention in law class, is still nonetheless a fascinating depiction of a film that is erected on difficult, weighty decisions by characters that always come with an accompanied ""but..."" whenever they are audibly proposed. Probably the most underrated component of the film, however, is the relationship Hanks' Donovan has with Rylance's Abel. The two occupy a sort of respectful, father/son relationship with one another that makes their banter that much more believable, in addition to softly humorous in some respect. The film would've benefited from more of these simple scenes between two men caught in very difficult positions where a rulebook of any kind eludes them.The film was co-written by the Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, and in some ways, the more somber style of filmmaking makes this feel more like a Coen spectacle than a Spielberg film. However, it's the poetry communicated through Spielberg's directing that makes the film feel so fluid, in addition to the strong narrative that is given time to build over the course of nearly two and a half hours. All of these elements blended with some great, subtle period cinematography and a strong Hanks performance and you have a fascinating adult drama that, while not as layered as it could be, is an enriching experience.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Not the thriller it wants to be,"Why would Stephen Spielberg want to make Bridge of Spies, a Cold War spy thriller, when there's already plenty of better movies out there, like The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, the original Manchurian Candidate, The Lives of Others, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, or even The Third Man? The answer seems that Spielberg is using Bridge of Spies to draw thinly-veiled allusions to the modern War on Terror and enemy combatants, with warnings about xenophobia, government propaganda, and global hyper-nationalism.Bridge of Spies is engrossing and Mark Rylance is especially good as a dispassionate pawn, seemingly apathetic to every part of life and every person, except he has a deep respect for people who get knocked down and stand up again. However, the movie is simply good, not the great movie it wants to be. It lacks the necessary noir and suspense, two aspects hard to achieve in color.We get a legal procedural followed by some low-intensity negotiation and some minor history lessons. Our hero, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), also plays a manipulated pawn, but he has a few tricks up his sleeve because he's compassionate and thoughtful and impervious to propaganda. Information is key, and thus also secrets, so we must keep secrets about lies and lies about secrets (insert modern discussion of cryptography here). Eventually, no one knows who is zooming whom.We have the Rule of Law, which so often breaks down to the Rule of Man, because people write laws and choose whether and how to enforce them. America wants to show off it is better than evil police states, but the lesson here is maybe that's all we do. We simply show off we are better without the actual moral higher ground.Maybe Mario Puzo wrote it best in The Godfather: ""The lawyer with the briefcase can steal more money than the man with the gun.""",7.0,Anonymous,History
A film about values,"The height of the Cold War, the late 1950s, was a time of anti-Communist hysteria fueled by Senator Joseph McCarthy's anti-Communist crusade and only four years after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were convicted and executed for providing atomic secrets to the Russians. While it may seem anachronistic to make a film about the Cold War, the points made in Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies are just as relevant today. Like Spielberg's Lincoln, it is a film about values, about standing up for what you know to be right instead of succumbing to your fears, not an examination of the rights and wrongs of international intrigue or the merits or demerits of the Cold War.Co-written by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman, insurance lawyer James Donovan, (Tom Hanks), is called upon by his boss (Alan Alda) to defend Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), a defense that would thwart a public opinion calling for his summary execution. In attempting to mount a defense, Donovan discovers that the government only wants him to go through the motions of due process, not to actually mount a strong case for his acquittal. Not even Donovan's family wants him to defend Abel, especially after they receive death threats and rocks are thrown through the windows.In the film's opening sequence, Abel is seen painting a self-portrait in a room filled with receivers and transmitters when he is interrupted by a phone call. Leaving his building, he is pursued by federal agents in a frantic chase through streets and subways tracked by cinematographer Janusz Kaminsky. When captured in his home by the feds, the taciturn Abel in a breakout performance by Shakespearean actor Rylance maintains his calm and denies that he is a spy. All he can say is to ask that the agent to please fetch his teeth from the bathroom. Un-Communist spy-like, Abel is also given to dry humor.When asked why he is so calm in the face of possible execution, he replies, ""Would it help?"" a response that is humorous and appropriate but repeated once too often in the film to maintain its edge. Though aware of the strong evidence of his client's guilt, Donovan establishes a good relationship with Abel whom he calls a man of integrity who is only serving his country. The first part of the film depicts the court proceedings, the sentencing, and Donovan's appeal to the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds, an appeal that he lost on a 5-4 decision.The bulk of the film, however, takes place in Berlin where it turns into an international spy thriller, and a good one at that. The film shows the CIA's secret U2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) flying at 70,000 feet en route to Russia to photograph military installations when it is shot down over Russian air space. When Powers disobeys instructions from his superiors to go down with the plane and is captured by the Russians where he is imprisoned and tortured, the event torpedoes the summit meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower, dashing the world's hopes for peace. Spielberg does not hold back from showing the techniques that Powers is forced to undergo, perhaps a reference to the CIA's use of water-boarding during the Iraq War.Called upon to negotiate a prisoner exchange between the Soviets and the East Germans of Powers and captured American student Frederic L. Pryor (Will Rogers) for Abel, Donovan is mugged by East German punks and stripped of his overcoat in the freezing snow, suggesting the addition of ""The Spy Who Got a Cold"" to the film's title. Anyway, coat or no coat, Donovan must maintain the ruse that he is an independent party, not an official government representative and the back and forth intrigue and chess match of opposing wills ratchets up the tension until its dramatic conclusion. Bridge of Spies strives for and achieves a refreshing balance, not gratingly pro-American or excessively anti-Soviet but a film that demonstrates the sordid nature of espionage on both sides.I could complain about the unnecessary role played by Amy Ryan as Donovan's devoted wife, the ending that goes on past the film's logical dramatic stopping point, or the overwrought score by Thomas Newman, but would it help? The film is best when it makes clear what American values are supposed to be about. Donovan's argument to the Supreme Court expresses this well. ""Abel is an alien charged with the capital offense of Soviet espionage,"" he said. ""It may seem anomalous that our Constitutional guarantees protect such a man.  Yet our principles are engraved in the history and the law of the land. If the free world is not faithful to its own moral code, there remains no society for which others may hunger."" Amen, brother!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Bridge of Spies Review,"During the Cold War, U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is captured by the Soviet Union after his U-2 spy plane gets shot down. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, Powers' only hope is New York lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) who is recruited by the CIA to negotiate his release. Donovan then boards a plane to Berlin to try to secure Powers' freedom through a prisoner exchange. If all went according to plan, the Soviets would get Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), the convicted spy who Donovan defended earlier in court.I will say that the film is not as exciting as the trailer but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. There isn't too much action or suspense as the core of this film is based on conversations between characters. The suspense comes from whether or not the people on the other side will follow through with what they say and whether or not the situation in which the characters are in the middle of, The Cold War, will have an impact on the proceedings. But what had the potential to be quite dull was not thanks to the performances of Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, the direction by Steven Spielberg, the score, and the cinematography that really captured the paranoia in that corner of the world during the Cold War. Hanks is great here as he was the only reason I saw this film. In his best role since Captain Phillips (I still think he should have been nominated for an Oscar for that one instead of Christian Bale for American Hustle). I liked him in this one because I found his character to be very endearing and very human. I also found that this went well when juxtaposed against the world he was in. Rylance, who I have never heard of before this, stole scenes as the Soviet spy Abel. He was very witty with a calm demeanour and who never let the situation get to him. He and Hanks had great chemistry which made their scenes together very entertaining. I just wish they could have had more scenes together as their storyline was only for the first quarter when Donovan defended Abel in court and a little near the end of the film during the exchange. The reason I say this is because the middle of the film was not as exciting to me since it dealt with Hanks being in Berlin during the Cold War and having his character negotiating for the release of Powers and also another prisoner Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers). These scenes were still good because of the great script by the Coen brothers and the acting by Hanks and others. They just just didn't have the same weight for me since the film chose to focus on Hanks's character Donovan instead of the characters he was trying to rescue so they came off as one- dimensional. I guess they just wanted Powers for what he knew but they still could have fleshed him out more than just in the one scene. Also it is evident that this is taking place during the Cold War but I wished I had more of a sense of that. In other words, they could have gone further with that idea as we never got to see ""how bad"" the Soviets and the Germans, who captured Pryor, were as nothing really happened to them (onscreen at least). Overall, this is just a great movie and one of Spielberg's best.Score: 8/10 keithlovesmovies.com",8.0,Anonymous,History
Destiny of Espionage,"One more credit to Spielberg. It's a very good entertainment movie. Sound and writing is on it's place, as expected. Mark Rylance makes an excellent interpretation on Rudolf Abel, in my opinion. Abel is a very charismatic and enigmatic person who never brakes up with his duty. In the other hand, Tom Hanks as Donovan, keeps the movie going on it's espionage suspance, although against most of the American people. Donovan keeps doing he's lawyer work as he knows best, believing that behind the Russian spy is a good person who was just following orders years ago. The movie gets intense in the end when the main reason of the movie takes place. Personally, i was expecting a different ending, however the producer didn't want to make a ""show off"" scene, which i can understand since the movie is based on real facts.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Classic Spielberg sensibilities,"Steven Spielberg needs no introductions, as he is arguably the most prolific director in film history and one of the few representations of classic Hollywood still working today. ""Bridge of Spies,"" Spielberg's latest, is evidence of that. It has classic sensibilities that are all but dead in today's market; sensibilities that Spielberg helped establish in the first place.""Bridge of Spies"" follows the true story of James Donovan (played by Tom Hanks), a life insurance lawyer who gets recruited by the government during the Cold War to defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance) in court, and then later negotiate the exchange of the spy for one of America's own, Francis Gary Powers (played by Austin Stowell).I had my reservations going into this film because the trailers made it seem like the whole story was just an exercise in jingoism. Without context, many of the lines used in the marketing campaign came off as platitudinous cliché's about how America is the best because we have the Constitution and it makes us the most just of any country in the world. Or, at least, that's the impression I had going in.In reality, my initial assumptions couldn't be farther from the truth. What I thought would be an endless stream of patriotic generalizations about Cold War America ended up being an intelligent critique of our own ethnocentrism. Donovan is hated by the public for much of the movie because he's the man appointed to defend Abel, who was viewed as some sort of devil. But Donovan understands that this man is just that: a man, like any other. He was merely doing the job he was assigned to do and deserves as fair a trial as anyone. Naturally, America doesn't sympathize with Donovan's quest for justice.Spielberg's critique of American society during the Cold War, and in general, is based on this conflict. Donovan's philosophy essentially boils down to treat others as you would treat yourself, an ideology that America hasn't always abided by throughout history. This is what makes the film so thoroughly engaging. Aside from being a taut, humble historical drama, it also forces America in front of the mirror, giving us a look at our past in a light not often used.Virtues aside, ""Bridge of Spies"" also functions incredibly on the technical side of things. Spielberg is known for his subtle long takes, and this film is no different. He eliminates the need for cuts by moving the camera around his actors in a way that allows for close-ups and wide shots to flow seamlessly, which often leads to takes running for several minutes. This allows the audience to fully immerse in each scene without even realizing what's going on, giving the illusion of reality that much more credence.This technical competence runs all the way back to the script, which is concise and engaging at every turn. Donovan is written incredibly well, which is only emphasized by the fact that Hanks, America's sweetheart, plays the character with his trademark precision. It goes without saying that you're on Donovan's side from his first appearance on screen, but it's his classic sense of wit that really locks you in. As is appropriate for an insurance lawyer from Brooklyn who finds himself under such absurd circumstances, Donovan greets every escalation in the stakes with a sort of professional sarcasm that keeps the tone light without breaking that valued sense of realism.Spielberg and success pretty much go hand-in-hand at this point, and it's good to see that the founder of the blockbuster still keeps his classic style close to his heart. ""Bridge of Spies"" probably isn't going to knock the socks off of anyone in the younger generations, but for the mature, patient moviegoer, this film is one of the most satisfying of the year.",,Anonymous,History
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Bridge of SpiesThe biggest difference between American and Russian spies is Americans won't trade military secrets for blue jeans.Mind you, the only trading transpiring in this drama is that of a human nature.Hired by the US government to represent accused KGB agent Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), insurance lawyer James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) goes on to negotiate Abel's exchange with Russia for a downed U-2 pilot (Jesse Plemons) and an American abroad.On the home front, Donovan's wife (Amy Ryan) and family are unaware of the dangers he faces on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall.Scripted by the Coen Brothers, directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks, Bridge of Spies is award bait at its best.

Spielberg's Latest Outing in Style,"Bridge of Spies is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks, which is the best director-actor duo in history in my opinion. Once again, Tom Hanks is so good as a lawyer who has to defend a Soviet spy during the Cold War. But probably the best performance was Mark Rylance, the man who played the Soviet spy, and he certainly deserves an Oscar nomination. The cinematography is so beautiful and Spielberg perfectly captures the world in 1957.Most of this movie is conversations between Hanks and others during negotiations or court room scenes. A lot of people can be turned off by this, claiming it's ""too boring."" But if you like drama with a lot of intrigue about history, you will be engrossed in Bridge of Spies. It is a slow and long movie, so you have to be patient while watching. However, there is a fantastic scene with an airplane that brings energy into the movie.Bridge of Spies is certainly not one of Spielberg's masterpieces, but it is still a great movie on its own.

Good film but lacks tension,"Bridge of Spies takes the audience back to a time when the entire world was on the brink of a thermonuclear war, however, it didn't make me feel that way. A plethora of small internal and external conflicts are presented in the film but it never really built up enough tension to put me on the edge of my seat. The film contradicted itself by presenting each problem as very serious with the use of incisive dialogue and melodramatic lighting without ever really letting the viewer know what was at stake. Although aesthetically pleasing, almost every scene's outcome seemed inconsequential throughout the movie. Tom Hanks did a great job with what he was given; it's the fault of the soft-hitting plot that he isn't up for an Academy Award. I have no idea what the the writers were trying to do with the Russian Spy character. If you watch the movie you'll understand. Even with all of these critiques, the film was very easy to watch and it made you want to know what was going to happen next. Despite being a good movie, it will undoubtedly be swallowed up by time for not being great. I would fully recommend this movie to any person interested in history or wants to pass two hours leisurely.Positive(s): I was pleasantly surprised with how well the movie flowed and I was never bored. Negative(s): I didn't feel any sort of apprehensive pressure while watching the film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Decent Historical Thriller,"I did not come to Bridge of Spies with particularly high expectations. Based on the commercials, it looked like an attempt to put a patriotic spin on what was an extremely embarrassing international incident for the United States. However, even though Steven Spielberg brings his usual optimistic outlook to the proceedings, he still crafts a well done film, boosted by an excellent cast and a script by the Coen brothers.Bridge of Spies focuses on the early 1960s prisoner exchange of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel for captured American pilot Francis Gary Powers and graduate student Frederick Pryor. Tom Hanks gives a strong performance as James Donovan, the American lawyer pressured into representing Abel and ultimately negotiating the exchange deal with the Soviets. He is backed by a strong supporting cast, especially Mark Rylance as Abel. Rylance deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination at the very least.The proceedings are prevented from descending into historical pageantry through a strong, witty script by the Coen Brothers. The serious national security proceedings are permeated with humor, particularly from the deadpan Abel. The script also manages to maintain a certain level of suspense, not a small feat given that we know how the events turned out. At the same time, the film offers important messages about the true nature of patriotism, lessons that are all too needed nowadays since patriotism has been reduced to militaristic fervor.The film does have some notable flaws. At times the pacing is rather slow, and the proceedings may lose the interest those with weaker attention spans. Furthermore, it downplays just how embarrassing the U-2 shoot down was for the United States, particularly after President Eisenhower was caught lying about the U-2 program at a US-Soviet summit. Nevertheless, the film is well worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Solid but nothing spectacular,"I don't think I can criticize this movie, it's a Spielberg film after all, nearly flawlessly made, Tom Hanks is excellent as usual (but let's face it Tom Hanks has never acted poorly in ANY film EVER), mostly historically accurate as well. In fact if it would have been made by anyone else I may have liked it a lot more than I currently do, but alas Steven Spielberg has become a victim to his own success and ability. So all I can say is that while this movie is solid it's nothing spectacular, there are no great scenes but the story is well done and it's evenly represented, a couple of weeks ago I watched Edward Zwick's Pawn Sacrifice and found it to be very pro American and anti Russian, Spileberg of course is above all this pettiness and delivers a balanced film in which both sides are fairly represented. However, I was expecting the raw power that Spielberg delivered in Munich (last time he tackled the theme of espionage) but that's not what this movie is about, it feels a lot simpler and the stakes never feel high. Bridge of spies is a good movie and can go on the B-Side of Steven Spielberg's greatest hits along with The Terminal, Lincoln, War Horse etc. while the A side continues to have Schindler's List, Saving private Ryan, Raiders of the lost ark etc.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Another Steven Spielberg history lesson (and based on Wikipedia not very much true),"This film was one of the most anticipated movies of 2015. It's directed by Steven Spielberg, has Tom Hanks in the lead role and has a script written by Joel and Ethan Cohen, but...it's more conversational and seems to be more dialogue intensive rather than any movement or action. Also, the movie is too long for the story and unnecessary baggage of scenes are added. Absence of adequate background score makes many scenes sound boring. Generally, there's not as much tension as one might hope, especially once Hanks is in Berlin, when film becomes slow as we wait for the deal to be brokered.It is OK movie, but that's about it. The film runs for over two hours and is almost nothing but talk, which makes it a bit of dull historical movie. In some ways, it feels like a film for school children. The flick's headlining novelty is Mark Rylance, who plays Abel with mesmerizing performance. Compering to him, Austin Stowell as Powers comes off as the equivalent of actor negative space. Overall, it just didn't make a huge impression on me.Rating: 6-Favorite quote:

Rudolf Abel: Would it help?",6.0,Anonymous,History
God bless America as we show justice to the world.,"Predictable stuff from Hollywood - shallow and very disappointing. Spielberg doing a kids version of a spy story. Poor Tom Hanks goes to Berlin to save the world from communism, and rescues the youth of America. And all he gets is the sniffles. Violins on the bridge, before dawn, for goodness sake. Given the accolades, I was hoping for something more suited for an adult audience. Rylance is a good actor, but that doesn't make it a good film, just watchable when he is in the scene. And those poor kids of Hank's - subject to such hatred because big daddy stood up for justice and the American flag. It isn't even interesting from the historic recreation of New York - just a demonstration of how much money can be spent on a movie that really doesn't tell much of a story. There could have been more depth, and less devotion to period drama. And the script was pretty dire at many points - dialogue when no words were needed at all.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Vintage Spielberg,"Just weighing in but with nothing new to add. I agree with other reviewers, it's a very entertaining film that's hard not to like. sometimes I am struck by that fact that Spielberg films often resemble Frank Capra films in that they uphold a high standard in filmmaking and don't always rely on naked characters and buckets of blood. In ""Bridge of Spies"", Tom Hanks has the Everyman role Capra used to employ. This one, in fact, is rated PG-13, which doesn't happen often in Lowest-Common-Denominator Hollywood.Tom Hanks never disappoints and an argument could be made that he is America's best actor. Here he is his old self, although a few pounds heavier than in previous pictures but an idealist in the James Stewart mold. Good supporting cast of unfamiliar faces and the story moves along at a good clip. It's all been said and I don't do summaries - read another reviewer for one. Very worth seeing, an oasis in a desert of crummy Hollywood movies.",,Anonymous,History
Modern American Propaganda,"'Bridge of Spies' looks at the peak of the Cold War tensions between two global superpowers as part of a political three-way negotiation drama. The movie is a good one and is well directed by Steven Spielberg and of course brilliantly acted by Tom Hanks, but it has one fundamental flaw: We are blatantly given the impression that America is loving and caring while the Soviet Union is cold and unsentimental. This becomes especially clear in the end parts of the movie. The characters involved in the swap are well-played and well develop through the film. The Soviet 'spy' (and very talented artist) is on one side of the deal while the Economics student studying Communism in Fascist/Capitalist Germany (whoever does that...) is on the other side of the table alongside Francis Gary Powers. The film in more than one way is therefore unbalanced and does not excitingly exceed expectations, as previous Hanks/Spielberg productions have such as 'Band of Brothers' and 'Saving Private Ryan'. A decent - good film overall nevertheless which manages to keep a good level of suspense throughout. 7.0/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

Yet another great Spielberg/Hanks film!,"Bridge of spies is directed by Steven Spielberg who is probably the most prolific and well known director of all time. He directed movies such as Jurassic Park, ET , Jaws , Raiders of the Lost Ark and many more! Though Bridge of spies is more of a serious real life event movie like Schindlers list or Lincoln. It is the fourth time Spielberg and Hanks have joined to make a film and it is yet the fourth time that they've made a great movie! (Saving private Ryan, Catch Me if you can and the Terminal)This movie is masterfully crafted, acted, shot and directed. It's what you'd expect from a Spielberg film! Though this is not everyones piece of cake. I you like a lot of serious talking and great Oscar worthy performances like me, then you'll be more then pleased with Bridge of Spies. But if you like more action/adventure Spielberg films keep away from this one even though I'd still recommend it!Bridge of Spies is one of the year's best film and I cannot wait to see this masterfully made film once again.

A Well Balanced Thriller,"There are two sides two Steven Spielberg. One- Making magnanimous movies with big budget and special effects, Two- Making history come to life with classic film-making. Bridge of spies belongs to the second type. Based on true events, Bridge of Spies tells the story of American Lawyer, Jim Donovan in two parts. The first part is where he tries to do his best as a defense lawyer for the alleged Russian spy Abel and the second part where he negotiates a prisoner exchange with Russians and Germans. The film has two different flows. But, one cannot argue over the shift in the storyline as it is based on real events and it is best that Steven Spielberg has kept it that way. Very well written dialogues, subtle humour and great acting makes this movie, a masterpiece. Not too emotional, not too funny, not too dramatic this movie balances everything well.Tom Hanks, well there is nothing to say about him we all know he gives the best. But Rylance, with very few lines is the one who steals the show in this film. His role adds a whole new dimension to a grey character. Apart from these two characters, other roles are hardly significant.If you are looking for an out and out entertainment, this movies pace might disappoint you. But this movie is for the good cinema lovers. Who loves and admires a work of art whenever they see one.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant and amazing entertainment!,"Brilliant and amazing film! Forget films based on John Le Carré's novels. It is a different approach about stories related to spies. Totally different, indeed! In the height of the Cold War, the inspiring and true story of the man who kept his commitment with the Law and the Democracy - precisely the political regime based on the Law - , even with risks for his career, his own life and the lives of his whole family, in his own country. The sequel of the Hanks' character during his speech to the Supreme Court is simply memorable! It reminds me Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck's performance) and the Lt Colonel Frank Slade (Al Pacino's performance). In my opinion, this film deserves at least the Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Best Screenplay (Charman add Coen Bros.), Best Film, Best Director (Spielberg), Best Actor (Hanks) and Best Supporting Actor (Rylance).

A Riveting Espionage Thriller That's Consistently Thrilling Despite Its Lack Of Action,"Marking the fourth collaboration between Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks, Bridge of Spies is an elegantly crafted, cleverly narrated & sincerely performed spy-thriller from the esteemed filmmaker who, even in what can be termed as his semi-retirement phase, continues to thrill & surprise us with stories that may not be as magical as his best works but still make up for an enriching experience.Inspired by true events, the story of Bridge of Spies is set in the 1960s during the Cold War and follows an insurance lawyer who is recruited to defend a Soviet spy, to give the illusion of a fair trial which in actuality turns out to be completely one-sided. But when an American spy plane pilot is caught by the Soviets, he's asked by the CIA to facilitate the exchange of spies between the two hostile nations.Directed by Steven Spielberg, Bridge of Spies continues his recent fascination with setting a drama around historical events and is another masterful work from the notable filmmaker that's thoroughly captivating from start to finish. While the story is dialogue-driven, the film has the structure of a cat-and-mouse game that keeps the interest alive and is wonderfully anchored by sensible performances from its cast.Production design team does a splendid job in recreating the timeline its story is set in with all the necessary details in place. Cinematography follows the mantra that other dramas by Spielberg carry and brilliantly reflects the grim period with its slightly darkened images. The pacing is steady and top-notch editing ensures that only relevant moments stay in the final print. Also, it's is one of those rare Spielberg flicks that's not scored by John Williams but Thomas Newman does well to fill up the void.Coming to the performances, Bridge of Spies features a much mature & dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, Alan Alda & others, amongst which Hanks & Rylance impress the most. Hanks is at his usual best in the role of James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer assigned to defend the arrested Soviet spy in the court and later helps in negotiating a prisoner exchange deal between US & USSR. Rylance plays the Soviet spy with effortless ease and owns almost every scene he appears in.On an overall scale, Bridge of Spies is a refreshing entry in the genre of espionage thrillers that's deftly scripted and confidently brought to life under Spielberg's assured direction & Hanks' reliable performance. The plot brims with political tension, has its own set of twists n turns, and is consistently gripping despite its lack of action. The year of 2015 has already seen its fair share of spy-thrillers but Bridge of Spies is definitely amongst the best ones to surface and marks another successful collaboration between Spielberg & Hanks. Definitely recommended.",,Anonymous,History

One other reason I didn't give it a 10 is because I'm just not a fan of the genre/time of event, but that's not the creator's fault. I overall liked the actors and think they did a good job however, the mom in the Dunavent family was strange. She was one of the few who acted worse than others, I feel like.

The Masterly Spielberg,"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. I need not say more. I entered the theatre with expectations. Two other things that made me more excited for the film was the casting of remarkable Mark Rylance (stage actor) to the big screen. I first saw him this year in BBC's Wolf Hall and was floored by the man. Al Pacino is quoted as saying "" he( Mark Rylance) speaks Shakespeare as if it was written for him the night before"" and also fact that Coen Brothers has co written the movie. The story essentially is a cold war espionage drama. The film does not have any pounding music, eye popping CGI, no 3D, no mind bending plot twist nor any thrilling/heart pounding scenes. Yet it is a timely drama reminding everyone of how the civilized society is supposed to function as per the rule of law and also about what it is to be human. Bridge of spies is vintage cinema. Every scene of the movie is so well done by the master craftsman Steven Spielberg that even some times the camera just narrates the story instead of dialogues. Coen brothers were very evident in the screenplay with their trademark subtle humour present throughout. Tom Hanks portrayed the role of James Donovan to perfection with ease and it was a real treat to watch the artist perform. Mark Rylance lived up to his reputation with a masterly subtle performance. The Cinematography, Editing & Direction reminded me of how inspiring and captivating the art of cinema can be. There has been some criticism that the movie does not have suspense enough but i think the movie is more a drama than a thriller or to quote Mr.Spielberg ""Character Thriller"".

It wasn't the most action packed but the cold war also wasn't full of action. The cold war was full of suspense and anticipation and I think the movie did a great job of recreating that feeling.

"Highly underrated, gripping and masterfully directed.","I can't remember the last time I missed a Spielberg picture in the cinemas. I had to check out Bridge of Spies because, while I am no expert on the cold war there was something inherently thought provoking about the very minimal trailers that were being shown.The story centres around Jim Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who has been recruited by the CIA to handle the case of a suspected Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance). I won't reveal anymore, I refuse to.While there is not much action in this film, it is incredibly sleek, and mysterious. It gave me strong impressions of both excellent espionage and noir cinema. Kudos to frequent Spielberg collaborator and top notch cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who weaves a beautiful display of icy, shadow-fueled photography. Truly gorgeous to watch.The writing is snappy, and ultimately superb. Can't expect much less from the Coen brothers who always seem to surprise me with their intelligent and clever scripts.Hanks is a brilliant lead, who almost seems like a fish out of water, but ultimately a man who sticks to his guns, and never backs down. His scenes with outstanding stage actor Mark Rylance are the best parts of the film. These two heavyweights go blow for blow with each other despite their scenes being considerably calm and talky.Spielberg very rarely lacks punch in his storytelling and this is another fine example of why he is considered as one of the all-time greats. This intelligent picture lacks a certain bravado of his earlier works, but that by no mean hinders from the films success. He is a tight, concise, and clever filmmaker who has yet again done wonders with an even more wonderful team of artists.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"A thrilling film, filled with many emotional moments.","Bridge of Spies is a biopic about an American lawyer named, James B. Donovan(Tom Hanks). During the Cold War, the FBI capture a spy from the Soviet Union named, Rudolf Abel(Mark Rylance). Donovan's firm, gives him the task of defending Abel, in a court of law. Donovan's insistence on being the best possible lawyer for the enemy nation's spy, makes him come under fire from the American government & press. Donovan somehow prevents Abel from being executed in the electric chair. This later comes in handy, when an American pilot named, Francis Gary Powers(Austin Stowell) gets captured in the Soviet Union. Now, it is up to James B. Donovan to facilitate a prisoner exchange & bring back Powers, safely to the US.Bridge of Spies is a spectacular film. Director Steven Spielberg, has made another masterpiece. This movie is even better than Spielberg's other biopics like, Lincoln(2012) & Schindler's List(1993). Lincoln(2012) is great, but it is slow. Schindler's List(1993) is a classic but, it is a bit slow as well. However, Spielberg has successfully pulled it off with this film. Bridge of Spies is primarily a drama but, it is extremely thrilling. You just don't know what's going to happen next, even in the final minutes of the film. I would have given this film a ten if it was say, 10 minutes shorter. Then, it would have been even more gripping. The suffering in Berlin during the time of the Berlin Wall, has been accurately depicted & is heartbreaking. Apart from Spielberg's brilliant direction, the performances are another highlight of the movie. Tom Hanks is outstanding as James B. Donovan. Hanks is charming, adds humor to the serious proceedings & can also be intense when the script needs him to be. Mark Rylance is amazing as Rudolf Abel. Amy Ryan is great as Mary Donovan.

Mikhail Gorevoy & Sebastian Koch are superb as Ivan Schischkin & Wolfgang Vogel respectively.

Spielberg And The Cold War,"The forty-five year period between 1945 and 1990 is one that the whole world knew as the Cold War. During that time, there was a huge struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union for control of how much of the planet should be free or under the yoke of the atheistic system that was Communism; and at several points, that war almost went from cold to hot. In the main, it was primarily a war of intelligence gathering; and the possibility of spies being captured on the wrong side of the Iron Curtain was always a possibility. Such an event is the subject of director Steven Spielberg's 2015 Cold War suspense thriller BRIDGE OF SPIES, the 27th film in this legendary director's career.Tom Hanks, who has made it his business of playing an Everyman, portrays the role of James Donovan, a New York insurance lawyer who, in 1957, was thrown into the breach of the Cold War by being forced to defend a KGB agent named Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) on three counts related to espionage activity. Although Hanks loses that case in court, Rylance is spared the electric chair because, as Hanks admonishes those in high places, the day may very well come when the Soviet Union might capture one of our spies behind their lines, and that a prisoner exchange might well be necessary.Three years later, in 1960, that very possibility comes to the fore when Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), a U-2 pilot working for the CIA, is captured by the Soviet Union after one of their missiles downs his aircraft. Hanks sees a huge opportunity for both countries (neither Rylance nor Stowell have divulged anything to their captors); but this potential boon is tainted by the capture of an American graduate student named Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers) on the wrong side of the newly-completed Berlin Wall in the winter of 1961. Hanks then gets a hard lesson in the bizarre nature of Cold War politics, as Rogers is being held by East German officials, and both they and the Soviets are on different pages when it comes to the Communist political playbook.With the help of some fairly cagey maneuvering on his part, though it is severely looked down by his fellow Americans in general, and his own wife (Amy Ryan) in particular, as coddling an enemy agent, he manages to set up the moment of truth for all three men on the Glienicke Bridge (the actual bridge that is known as the Bridge Of Spies) that separates Berlin from Potsdam, all of this without any shots being fired in anger.Given that these events happened half a century in the past, and that an entire generation has grown up not knowing what the Cold War actually was, almost any other filmmaker might have had a very difficult time making the story clear. But then Spielberg has never been just any other filmmaker, and, being part of that generation that did know the fear that life as they knew it could end in a matter of hours, he knew that this was a story with huge implications, both political and humanistic. BRIDGE OF SPIES is a masterpiece of tension and suspense, with Spielberg continuing to show the influence of Alfred Hitchcock in his work; and Hanks basically does a role not dissimilar to James Stewart in several of Hitchcock's classic films. The depiction of the Cold War is magnified in the way Spielberg depicts the way the Berlin Wall cut off both the eastern and western parts of that city, and how Soviet soldiers cut down those who tried to jump over the wall (not unlike similar scenes involving the Nazi death camps in the director's 1993 masterpiece SCHINDLER'S LIST. Rylance gives a superb low-key performance as Abel, a man resigned to his fate whatever it is but willing to accept what comes from it, gaining a lot of respect from Hanks in the process. Spielberg also superbly recreates that horribly tense period of the late 1950s and early 1960s where America was at risk, probably less from its fears of the bomb than its own anti-Soviet paranoia.Because John Williams, Spielberg's long-time collaborator, was unavailable due to health issues, Thomas Newman, part of Hollywood's illustrious film scoring dynasty, stepped in to do the score for BRIDGE OF SPIES; and while it may not have the typical verve of Williams, Newman's score has a lot to recommend it, including the influences of both Shostakovich and Copland, avoiding the easy and (in some ways) expected patriotic cues. Sober and serious much of the time, but with the added wit and gravitas of Hanks' and Rylance's performances to keep the story from getting too grim, BRIDGE OF SPIES is another masterpiece in a long line of masterpieces for Spielberg, especially in his collaborations with Hanks; and it is a film that reminds us that the Cold War, though a part of history now, is also still an important part of that history.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A BRIDGE TO NOWHERE,"Steven Spielberg's Bridge of Spies is a Cold War drama set in the early 1960's. The movie is crowded with stories that all crash into each other. Sadly, they never generate any real drama. How could the man who made Jaws come to give us movies that have about as much drama as an election for President in Russia.The movie starts by showing us a guy painting a self portrait. Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance, recently of Wolf Hall fame). is a very unlikely spy, seemingly a simple man engrossed in his work as a painter. When he is arrested, James Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance defense attorney, a 'common man' type who lives in Brooklyn with his wife and children, is picked by the Bar Association to represent the suspected Russian spy. Out of the blue so to speak, we are told the story of Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell), the pilot of a US spy plan shot down while over the USSR. Powers is taken prisoner by the Soviets.Gee, I wonder how these dots are going to get connected?Donavan insists on giving Abel the best defense he can. In the process, he becomes as hated a figure as Abel. The trial judge, the newspapers, his friends and even his family, all try to convince him that he only has to go through the motions of representing Abel and no one expects him to get Abel acquitted because we all know he's guilty, right? Well, yes, we all do. The audience is shown from the start that Abel really is a spy so there is no suspense there. Abel's trial turns into a 'show trial' in spite of Donavan's efforts. Donavan's only success comes when he convinces the trial judge to sentence Abel to 30 years instead of the electric chair.And this is where the plot connects the Powers spy plane story - the CIA wants to exchange Abel for Powers. It asks Donavan to act as negotiator because the US government does not want to get involved directly in the negotiations. Donavan accepts and heads to Berlin.Now the movie could have just told us these stories and it would be a straight cold war drama - but no, its hero Donavan isn't going to just be a pawn for the CIA. So, enter a US student studying in Germany who is caught on the wrong side of the Berlin Wall on the day it is erected. It seems he is trying to save a girl he is in love with, or maybe it's just a friend - it doesn't matter because the student is just a plot device. He is arrested on charges of being a spy for a reason that will become clear.Donavan, after a series of cat and mouse games with various agents of the Soviets secures the deal to release Powers, but he will not agree to it unless the student is also released. The CIA goes nuts - it wants Powers and doesn't care about the student. Donavan won't budge - he is a decent American and we all know that decent Americans are far better than their duly elected ghastly government. Pont made. Story of stupid American student understood - he is there to be rescued.The screenplay was pieced together by more than one person - three or maybe two and a half - Joel and Ethan Coen were brought aboard to redo the original Matt Charman script. For this reason, the script is choppy and none of the characters is fully realized - except Donavan. What I hated about Mark Rylance in Wolf Hall was his stoical almost comatose attitude to everything that happened. In this movie, he is actually more deadpan, but his lack of concern about everything is used in the plot. On more than one tense occasion, Donavan asks his client if he is worried and Abel always answers, ""Would it help?"" It might help if Rylance moved an eyebrow once in awhile.The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long and could have been brought in less than 2 hours. There are lots of Spielberg 'mood shots'. The music is like listening to crème puffs oozing out their goo then exploding at the 'dramatic' points - John Williams was ill (probably indigestion listening to his own scores after Jaws) so Thomas Newman filled in as pastry conductor. There are a lot of appearances by fine actors (Alan Alda among them) who are given about as many lines as Rylance has facial expressions.Keeping in character with Bridge of Spies, I am now going to do a flip and stitch in a new perspective - in spite of all the above, go see it. Tom Hanks is just so good at playing these kinds of roles that you shouldn't miss it. Not the showy stuff of Forrest Gump or Philadelphia, but the kind of roles that Henry Fonda gave us in 12 Angry Men and a host of other films. Another quietly fantastic Hanks' performance is worth the price of admission.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Bridge of Spies,"The film ""Bridge of Spies"" set during the cold war is a collection of banalities including a predictable plot, mediocre acting and dull music. The screenplay could have been much more thrilling if the writers would have followed the main events in a more historically accurate way.The real life of James B. Donovan was much more exciting than the one depicted in the film. He was a lawyer at the Nuremberg trials and was already a well-known lawyer when he took the Rudolf Abel case. Donovan did not see Berlin wall escapees being shot; the shootings, which were the most similar to the ones depicted were those associated with the killing of Peter Fechter that happened the summer after the Powers/Abel exchange on the Glienicke Bridge.The real life stories of the spies of that period offer rich material for a writer, however the Coen brothers took the most uninteresting segment of the espionage story. The characters are bland and forgettable. This is an example of a politically correct propaganda film showing the good work of the intelligence services.The film ""Bridge of Spies"" is boring and disappointing – a naïve film made for a naïve audience. It is clear that Spielberg is a populist and the master of banality.Read more at: http://indie-cinema.com/2016/09/bridge-of-spies-review/",2.0,Anonymous,History
"With subtle messaging and outstanding acting, Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" knocks it out of the park","In my mind, there are only two kinds of movie: good and bad. What makes a good movie good depends on a variety of factors that boil down to one thing: does it satisfy the needs of the audience? If you go to an action movie, chances are you go into it expecting many things to blow up and not a bunch of romantic interludes. If you get a lot of booms, then you are satisfied, or if you get a lot of romance, you will probably be dissatisfied.""Bridge of Spies"" is a very satisfying movie.This is not an action film by any stretch of the imagination, mind you. Only three or four booms occur and only a handful of gunshots are seen. This is not a spy film, either. True, the main points of the film centers around two ""spies."" For those not well versed in history, here's the set-up:In 1957, Rudolph Abel, played very simply yet effectively by Mark Rylance, is arrested in New York by the FBI on charges of espionage. Appointed to his defense is Tom Hanks playing James Donovan, an insurance lawyer with a good family struggling to raise his children in the midst of the Cold War atmosphere of paranoia.In 1960, Francis Gary Powers is shot down flying a U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union and is captured alive. In 1961, the Berlin Wall is erected, completely separating East Berlin from West. Finally, in 1962, a prisoner exchange is arranged for Powers and Abel in Berlin, on the Glienicke Bridge, known as ""the bridge of spies.""Donovan is given the unenviable task of defending a self-admitted spy, putting him in a position much like that of John Adams who took the case of the British soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre. Hated by his own people for defending values that everyone in America should value, Hanks' Donovan must wrestle with his morals in the face of people who have bought into their own propaganda and forgotten what is truly at stake.Spielberg puts the values of America at the heart of this movie, but doesn't rub it in your face. On the contrary, through the simple but powerful character interactions and very simple background music, Spielberg lets the audience come to the conclusion for themselves the results of sticking to your values, even when you don't want to, with implications that easily apply today (think Guantanamo.)For those interested in history, the set directors did a wonderful job showing Cold War-era America and Berlin, Berlin especially. It's amazing to think that even 17 years after the end of World War II, East Berlin still had large sections of the city in ruins.Don't look for anything fancy, but don't look at anything at face value. Appreciate the simple yet smart repartee that Hanks shares with characters such as Abel, FBI agents, and Soviet and East German bureaucrats. Reflect on the messages that this film sends in parallel images seen throughout the film. Hopefully, you will come out of the theater feeling ... satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Bridge Of Pies,"Bridge Of Spies acts as if you are ordering food at a restaurant (much like that one scene with all the food in East Berlin). However, you've ordered a rare steak and what comes out is a medium steak. It's the same food, and you'll eat it, but it's not what you ordered. Bridge Of Spies just feels too cautious in it's approach. The trailers were extremely misleading (tho I don't judge the film on that) and nothing really happens. Instead of the suspense and highly intense story I was believing I was going to get, I got a courtroom drama with a cliché side story instead.Bridge Of Spies is underwhelming, tho if you deal with it, the middle portion of the film is quite fast paced and well filmed. However, if you look at the two sides of the middle, you'll find a slow paced, uneventful, cliché riddled, classic Spielberg film and a classic Tom Hanks performance. Nothing all that new nor great, but at times enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Enthralling Cold War espionage thriller by Steven Spielberg,"Director Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks collaborate once again this espionage thriller set in the 1950s in the height of the Cold War, a period of political tensions between many nations across the globe and a time when the United States facing threats of communism from the Soviet Union that ravaged on until the early 1990s following the fall of the Berlin Wall. Based on the true events, Tom Hanks play James Donovan, an American lawyer who takes on a daunting court case to defend Rudolf Abel (played by Mark Rylance), who is suspected of being a Russian spy, much to the outrage of the public as well as his wife and children. When CIA U-2 Spy-plane pilot Francis Scott Powers (played by Austin Stowell) is shot down and captured by the Soviets, Donovan is assigned into a negotiation with Germany to exchange Abel for Powers who is held hostage by German officers. This film marks Steven Spielberg's first collaboration with the Coen Brothers who produced this film, though the lack of humor typical for the directorial duo make it difficult to tell.This film does a pleasant job with highlighting the key points of the Cold War conflicts. It accurately portrays the atmosphere and the paranoia of nuclear war that America dealt with during this period. After all, it is Steven Spielberg behind the camera, and his director appears to carry polished knowledge on American history as demonstrated in some his previous outlets. One of the Cold War's most crucial elements of paranoia is best demonstrated in a scene for an example where Donovan's young daughter is in school and her class is watching an instructional video on seeking shelter for when a nuclear explosion occurs, and you see clips of cities getting wiped out by nuclear explosions. It genuinely shows the emotions people felt when the United States was in conflict against the Soviet Union, and how the threat of nuclear exchange was dangerously high. The Coen Brothers' screenplay and the direction are very well accomplished here, at least for the majority. Spielberg ambitiously maintains intriguing story as it follows the perilous journey of the main character and his attempt to make a deal with the Soviet Union, a deal that can carry catastrophic consequences if gone wrong. And with a crafty hand like Spielberg, he manages to keep the plot moving at a fairly solid pace, even when the film gets a bit too talky at certain points. Though the story doesn't quite offer many elements of surprise or even emotional depth (especially for a Spielberg flick), Spielberg fuels in plenty of substance to sustain the plot on an intriguing scale. The biggest disappointment in the narrative department however, may lie in the anti- climatic (though nicely shot by Janusz Kaminski) ending as the story concludes in a fading light fashion rather than with a bang, but there are some fair goodies in terms of the acting. Tom Hanks leads a terrific performance as his character James Donovan who is written beautifully without feeling very lionized with heroism. Mark Rylance does a pretty swell job as Rudolf Abel, the antagonist character who is portrayed very humanly without falling victim to contrived villainous characterization.Bridge of Spies is one of the best film of the year and is definitely a must see. While it certainly isn't as memorable as Steven Spielberg's other works, its still very satisfying. This is also probably the best film you will see centered on the Cold War.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Hanks and Spielberg. An unrivaled pair.,"""I am Irish, you are German. But what makes us Americans? Just one thing, The rulebook. We call it the Constitution and agree to the rules, and that's what makes us American.""Spielberg returns to the history of war long after ""War Horse"", a story of a stallion with a Lassie attitude during WWI, but not with heroic images of the battlefield as in ""Saving Private Ryan"". ""Bridge of Spies"" takes place during the Cold War. A period during which espionage was commonplace and super powers completely distrusted each other. As a result a whole arsenal of nuclear missiles were aiming at the main cities in both continents. Spies infiltrated into society and gave the authorities and agencies all sorts of secret information. And those spies just look like we imagined them. Dignified dressed men with a long coat and a stylish trilby, shyly and cautiously moving through the crowd and revealing a rolled up piece of paper somewhere out of a wall. After that they deciphered this message by means of an ingenious mechanism and a complicated decoding key in their sober furnished apartment. And that message contained the new coordinates where the next message was hidden. Well, in my childhood I imagined it would be like that.The most successful part of this film are the overall eye-catching images and decorations. The setting looks absolutely beautiful with lots of details. The city of New York in the 60s with its boulevards full of beautiful cars, the costumes, the atmosphere and family values in that period. Thus we are introduced to the the family of James Donovan (Tom Hanks). A typical American model family, residing in a house decorated in atom style, elegantly dressed in the fashion of those days and with a disciplined lifestyle. In contrast, a bit later we are witnessing the construction of the Berlin wall that splits this city into two parts. A grim, postwar, snow covered Berlin where heartbreaking scenes take place.Key figure in this espionage drama is James Donovan, an ordinary lawyer who's specialized in legal cases with insurance companies. From one moment to the other he needs to defend the recently arrested Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). In those days anyone or anything that has to do with communism is automatically suspicious and should be condemned immediately. This means that this cold-blooded spy can't count on a fair trial. But they forgot about Donovan, because this principled lawyer convulsively believes in the constitutional rule that everyone, no matter what their crime or origin, is entitled to a defense and isn't guilty until proved otherwise. The result is that the hostile public opinion isn't only focused on Abel but also on Donovan, someone of Irish descent but American at heart.Did ""Bridge of spies"" make a huge impression on me? No not really. Not that the perfectionistic images are disappointing. Or that the acting is abominably bad. But because I wasn't waiting for the umpteenth historical war-documentary. The used clichéd contradictions between the two superpowers was a bit to obvious. For instance, the circumstances of Abel's imprisonment seemed more comfortable than those of the American prisoners in Eastern Europe. And the cunning way Spielberg bypasses the historical character and gives it a more adventurous and heroic touch, shows that he must make concessions to Hollywood's management. On the other hand it was a relief to see that the image of a spy is shown in a realistic way. So don't expect James Bond or Ethan Hunt situations, filled with impetuous action and death-defying stunts while making use of high tech gadgets. The spies in ""Bridge of spies"" are ordinary characters who perform their ""spy-work"" in a simple and less spectacular way.And finally, the importance of a star actor such as Tom Hanks is of course crucial for this film.Hanks is and will always remain one of my favorite actors. A charismatic and versatile actor who turns each role into a masterpiece. He dominates in every movie. Without Hanks this would only be a typical historical drama that has taken shape in the mind of the master himself, Steven Spielberg.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",7.0,Anonymous,History
Coen brothers propaganda,"The message is that the ""other"" is always a gift, and that Americans who resent those who seek to destroy their country are evil. No one in fact ever attacked Donovan's home, but it's a made up scene for the movie to reinforce how awful average Americans are, typical Coen brothers' nonsense. The push is always free of the fact that the Soviet system was and is vastly less concerned with civil liberties or rights than America. However, the movie frequently picks apart American values and slips these themes into the movie like roofies to lull the audience drinking in this bull. When Donovan tries to appeal and is warned off for the potential damage to his career, they forget this never happened, but the same film makers would never highlight how many mainstream Americans get de-platformed everyday from Facebook, Twitter and others in the greatest assault on the First Amendment in American history. Great acting, sets, cars and clothing, etc. Too bad there's a political anti-American theme dressed up as ""history"".",4.0,Anonymous,History

How do we trade our pilot Gary Powers for the Russian spy Rudolf Abel?Mark Rylance as the Russian spy is so good that I can't think of anyone's performance that can beat him for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Director nomination for Spielberg, The Coen Bros. for their script, Thomas Newman for music, Janus Kaminski for Cinematography.Amy Ryan as Hanks's wife and Sebastian Koch as the German lawyer Vogel steal every scene they are in. There is much humor to cut the tension and pathos as Hanks puts his family in grave danger representing the Russian spy with a big heart.From Brooklyn to East Germany when they are putting up the Wall is a nice jump in locations and the sets are so real you think you are really there.Could be a contender for Best Picture.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Interesting but somewhat draggy,"To start off, Tom Hank's acting was spot on. He played the character James Donovan well, and the film as a whole allows us to root for him and to feel what he feels, even though everyone looks down on him for his ideals. Mark Rylance's character (Rudolf Abel) was dry in my opinion, although there were small moments where he shined.The plot as a whole was interesting, but the movie's progress felt somewhat slow. Was it to build up tension? I'd guess so, though I didn't feel it and I was always waiting for more to happen (to no avail, until the finale). The movie could have been shortened to an hour an a half, in my humble opinion. Perhaps it is somewhat due to the relatively simple and short main plot.Not an absolute must watch in my opinion. I'm sorry but I expected so much more.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Steven Spielberg and Kaminski put out another gem,"Spielberg and the Cohen Brothers are a dream team for films like this. The photography by Kaminski, a favorite of Steven, is only matched by the costumes created by Polish born Kasia Walicka (who also did the work for the Cohens in Moonrise Kingdom). Steven has an affinity for capturing the ethos and complexity of Eastern Europe period films as demonstrated in Schindlers List and now in Bridge of Spies.Tom Hanks plays his usual self, milking scenes with small gestures that lend a form of gravitas to otherwise normal events. His gradually worsening cold gives him a chance to play with his handkerchief that otherwise sits like a soldier in his coat pocket, rigid as the East German guards. If you look up the real person that he plays (Donovan), you will notice that Tom does a bang up job in capturing the character of the man.The story is true, the scenes where Berlin becomes divided by a wall are graphically real and disturbing. Spielberg uses the camera as the eyes of citizens separated by the wall. Depending on which side you end up provides a polar opposite understanding of what's happening.As for the Russian Spy played by Oscar winning English actor Mark Rylance, I was stunned by his minimalist interpretation and limited dialog that riveted my attention to everything he spoke and the little gestures that made his character so vivid.A lot of people felt he did not deserve and Oscar. I say he deserved it by stripping out all unnecessary movements and character effects and still leaving a powerful presence. Unlike Stallone who milks every scene with the same body language, Mylance shows his gifts he learned from stage roles and his management of the Shakespeare Theater. Expect more from this man. Steven already is pulling him into the animated BFG story coming out now.The only part I did not like is the one dimensional treatment of the U2 pilots, young bucks out of central casting. Gary Powers was a much more complex person than shown in this film. This would have added an extra dimension on what the value of each ""spy"" was to their respective countries.An excellent film, done in cold, unemotional, frigid, bleak style.",10.0,Anonymous,History

'It doesn't matter what others think. You know what you did.',"The setting for this based on a true story film is the 10950s – that tense period when in America children were put through classroom drills in case of an expected (or rather, feared) nuclear attack form Russia. Most people had bomb shelters stocked with supplies for the propaganda response that the Cold War ruled everyone's thinking. Remember those days? If not then this film will most assuredly force you to stare at the anxiety that ruled the politics and the military and the populace during that awful time.Steven Spielberg directs a script created by the Coen Brothers and Matt Charman and has engaged a splendid cast that offers many insights into the thinking of that period. The story (for those who are shaky on facts and dates) is as follows: 'In the cold war, an insurance lawyer, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), who hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II, is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers (Austin Stowell) who was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission- with a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) who was arrested for espionage in the US. The strong anti- Communist mood at the time makes him a target from those (the general populace) who think Abel should just be executed. Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. And of course Donovan's theory works, emphasizing the humanity that can resist fear of the unknown in the time of Cold War.The cast is uniformly excellent with special kudos to Alan Alda, Sebastian Koch, Amy Ryan and of course Hanks and Rylance. Superb script, well re-enactment of an ugly part of our history, and some fine nuances about faith in the democratic system make this one of the finest films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Outstanding example of modern film-making,"Tom Hanks plays James B. Donovan, a lawyer whom his superior asks to take on the defence of captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). To the surprise of everybody, Donovan does not just try to keep up the facade of due legal process but really attempts to get Abel off. Eventually he persuades the court that Abel is valuable currency, given that the Soviets may at some point capture an American spy who will have to be exchanged. Once this happens, the US government approaches Donovan to negotiate the exchange, which takes place in Berlin. 'Bridge of Spies' is a great Spielberg that in some ways is typical of the approach of this director to historical material: At the centre of the plot is an everday person - Donovan - who decides to do more than what is expected of him (first during Abel's trial, and then when he negotiates the exchange), and that America has people like him is one thing which makes it a great country. The care that has been taken with costumes and sets needs to be stressed. Literally everything is spot-on, from the way US and Soviet prisons differ over the S-Bahn carriages and the scenes showing how the Berlin wall is being built to the films that cinemas in Berlin are showing in the winter 1961-62 (for example 'One, Two, Three' - which back then flopped in Berlin - and 'Spartacus'). The acting is superb throughout, and 'Bridge of Spies' is beautifully filmed: Spielberg paid a lot of attention to the colour schemes that characterise scenes in the US and in East and West Berlin, with the US being far more colourful that dark blue-grey Germany. All in all this is an outstanding example of modern film-making - a world away from the propagandistic myth-making of for example 'Darkest Hour' (2017).",9.0,Anonymous,History
average to boring,"OK, Bridge Of Spies.

A Wonderfully Done Historical Drama,"If you're a fan of historical dramas--films based on true stories and the like--then you definitely should check out ""Bridge of Spies"". I found this movie to be absolutely great, and it's very easy to see how and why it's been nominated for Best Picture.Perhaps the strongest part of this film is its overall production. I didn't know a thing about the movie going into it (I watched it as part of my attempt at seeing all of the 2016 Best Picture nominees), and so I had no clue that it's a Steven Spielberg film. That said, when you see this movie you'll be reminded of what true craftsmanship looks like in a film production. The scenes, the camera work, pretty much everything in this film just comes together to make it an outstanding effort in filmmaking.I also can say that I enjoyed Tom Hanks in this performance. I do sometimes have trouble getting into Tom Hanks movies these days, as he's sort of become too big of a star--I always see him as himself rather than as whoever he's playing on screen. That was true for ""Bridge of Spies"" as well, but the role of a random New York attorney in the middle of the 20th Century makes that whole aspect less bothersome than if he were playing a more well known historical figure.All that said, I seriously considered giving this movie a perfect 10, and I can see how many people might do just that. I've held back from the perfect rating for one lone aspect, and that's that this movie probably doesn't have the ""epic"" feel to it that I tend to want to reserve a perfect score for. ""Bridge of Spies"" is a fantastic movie that will entertain you for a couple of hours--but fifteen years from now it's probably not going to be a movie that you remember too much about. The story provides great escapism for the moment, but it just isn't so mind blowing or suspenseful that it warrants being thought of in the same category as, for me, an ""Unforgiven"" or a ""Chinatown"". Thus my 9/10 star rating.",9.0,Anonymous,History

But if you want to see a good realistic spy movie that shows what spies looks like in a real world this movie is a must. Again Tom Hanks performed perfectly. Directing, screenplay and cameraman job is done with highest standards. The only weak spot i would think of is it gets too sentimental at times. But who has seen Steven Spielberg movies, knows he does it a lot. I totally recommend this movie for history, real life events based movie lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Everyone needs to see this movie IMHO,"We were vacationing in Germany only last week. But as soon as my wife and I returned home, everyone who had seen this movie strongly recommended that we see it. Turns out that we were standing in each and every location shown in the movie including the outside of the Russian and US embassy as well as the streets, bridges and historic sites shown in the movie.So, not only is this movie strongly tied to the real locations but also the U2 spy plane news story that I personally recall seeing in the news years ago....The best part of the movie is the accurate portrayal of the exceptional main character..... and there are some wonderful surprises as well.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Engaging, Entertaining and very Hollywood","A well acted movie with catchy dialog. Too often though, it sounds like punch lines being delivered. ""I'm not afraid to die....Then the punchline...but it wouldn't be my first choice."" Unfortunately it was meant to please not give the story any depth. At the end of the film you know nothing about, nor care about, the characters other than what was minimally needed to move the story. Just for the record, all the women are minor characters.

A somewhat exciting but rather bland story of Americans helping each other,"Bridge of Spies is about a simple American lawyer, played by Tom Hanks, who during the 60's Cold War defends a Soviet spy, played by Mark Rylance. Hanks eventually end up in the middle of East Berlin to negotiate a trade, the Soviet spy for an American pilot. The film is directed by Steven Spielberg which means that the two heavyweights are reunited once again, the last time being in 2004 when they collaborated on The Terminal. Bridge of Spies was nominated for an Oscar, among others in the category for best picture. Mark Rylance won surprisingly for best supporting role.Bridge of Spies is a very skillfully crafted film but with such a competent director as Steven Spielberg, I wasn't expecting anything else. What really stands out with Bridge of Spies is how great they've recreated East Berlin in the 60's. The production design, the costumes and the music is indeed top class. I was curious about the story itself, but at the same time I sort of suspected it to be a pretty one-sided tale of American heroism. I was right.The fact that Bridge of Spies is told from an American perspective is not a problem, there are tons of great films told that way. The thing that bothers me is the liberties they take with the truth, just for dramatic effect. Everything can of course not be true in a film based on real events, but this film steps over the line a couple of times. An example of this is the portrayal of how the Soviet treats their prisoners just to make them look worse. The other thing that bothers me is the pacing of the film and the fact that it never really takes off. It's sort of like watching a motion picture combined with a documentary where they twist and turn the truth. Hanks spends a lot of time in East Berlin without ever really finding out anything new and vital. With its 2 hours and 20 minutes, Bridge of Spies is simply too long and could have been made on or below 2 hours. The story is however interesting and the film looks good, 6 out of 10.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6.0,Anonymous,History
My Rating: 8,"Okay. Because of the perspective of every idealistic person and mostly because this movie is based on real historical events it should be also presented here. Yes, the world has the need of such persons, regardless of age, gender, nationality. The final explanations in the film can best explain this.About that the highest human nature does not recognize propensities and is capable of creativity. Often transcend the established order and shines above it, although we know many cases where it remains neglected, gray and misunderstood.About the nonsense that we have caused to ourselves some time ago, and are still trying to inflict. About complete rethinking of our values. About the price and the meaning of human existence. About farsightedness and nearsightedness, which in both cases are defects, equally different world views.About the cult of personality, but also of the way that it is displayed. More decently for the one who receive himself as surpassing it will always be better if he is modest and non-woven. I.e. it may be added further quality and quantity to be removed. About that books remain better than the movies (with very few exceptions).http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History
From Brooklyn to Berlin,"***MILD SPOILERS***True story of the capture conviction and later exchange of Soviet master spy Rudolf Abel, Mark Rylance, who was caught in his Brooklyn hotel room by the FBI trying to relay,in a hollowed out US nickel,a secret documents to his Soviet controllers back in 1957. What seemed like an open and shut case of espionage Abel was given insurance lawyer James B. Donovan, Tom Hanks, to represent him to show the world as well as the hated Soviet Union that he was to get a fair trial before he's to be executed or at least sent away for life for his crimes. Donovan really takes his job as well as the US Constatution seriously and defends Abel to the best of his ability only to have his client convicted and given a 30 year sentence which to many Americans seems like a slap on the wrist: That's after the Rosenbergs were executed for the very same crimes that Abel was convicted of some five years earlier.With Abel locked away in federal prison in Georgia and Donoven appealing his conviction US Air Force pilot Francis Gary Powers,Austin Stowell, is shot down with his U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union on of all days May 1-May or Workers Day in the USSR-1960 giving Abel a lifeline for an early out by the US Government who's ready to exchange him for Powers. It was Powers who against orders didn't end up killing himself with a cyanide tipped needle before he was captured by the Russians alive that exposed him as a US spy not a weather man as the US Government claimed he was.With Donovan still Abel's lawyer he's told by his government to negotiate Abel's release in exchange for Powers who's been given a three year sentence, a lot less the Abel was given by the US courts ,behind bars as well as seven years house arrest-In the Moscow Hilton- by the Soviet peoples court. It's with all this going on a love sick American collage student Fred Pryor played by Will Rogers?, not the one you think it is but someone else, is busted by the Communist East German police in trying to get his German girlfriend out of the city of divided Berlin before it's walled up by the East German police as well as military. With the US more then willing to let the totally innocent Pryor hang-by his you know what's- but only wanting to get Powers, who in fact was spying on the USSR, freed Donovan makes it a point to get both Pryor as well as Donovan freed or else he just won't cooperate with his string pullers in both the State Department and Pentagon.***MILD SPOILERS SINCE HISTORY ALREADY SHOWED US WHAT HAPPENED***Donovan prevailed in the end getting both Powers as well as Pryor freed for the return of Rudolf Able in a nail biting exchange on the Berlin Gilenicke Bridge with out as much as a shot, in anger or celebration, being fired. Donvovan who was hated and called a dirty Commie by almost everyone who knew him is now a hero not only by getting Powers and Pryor back but later getting over 9,000 Cuban freedom fighters and their families back to freedom after being captured and arrested by Castro's troops in the disastrous ""Bay of Pigs"" invasion of Communist Cuba in 1961. As for Francis Gary Powers the main man in this movie he never was given the respect that he deserved in him not killing himself before the Commies or Russans captured him thus exposing the entire U-2 spy operations to the world at large. And putting the US, who up until then said it was national policy not to spy on anyone, the self proclaimed ""Good Guys of the Free World"" in a bad light.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Seems a bit one-sided,"I guess the point of the movie was to demonstrate that Americans are over-reactive, unfair and hateful. From childhood, apparently, Americans learn to be bad people who grow up to be worse people. Any enemies we have must be good people. Never mind that there were Russian spies in America, they are portrayed as the ""good guys"" here. Americans were bad for a.) catching Russian spies and b.) engaging in the same espionage Russia was engaging in.A common theme among Hollywood stories seems to be that everyone but Americans are the good guys, yet Hollywood still has not relocated to the Palestine territories. Curious. It seems somewhat ironic to me that they benefit from capitalism while making movies about how actually evil capitalists are, then give themselves awards for half a year. Nobody I know makes $42 million for 24 days of filming, but somehow the person that does is more virtuous than my neighbor, who retired from law enforcement. He thinks America is a great place to live.",3.0,Anonymous,History
An exciting film which however varies wildly from the real truth,"This film is an example of myth-making, whether intentional or not I do not know. There is very little chance that the U-2 spy aircraft supposedly 'shot down' in 1960 by the Soviets in the notorious 'U-2 Incident' was really shot down at all. The various existing stories significantly contradict each other. The Russians say they fired one S-75 Dvina missile, but two different internet sites say that seven or thirteen missiles were fired, one shooting a MIG-19 out of the sky by mistake. I do not believe that any of these stories is true. We now know that Lee Harvey Oswald insisted the plane was never really shot down, and papers released in 2012 by the CIA show that they never believed either that their own man, the young pilot Francis Gary Powers, was really shot down. So why should the film suggest that he was and perpetuate a now discredited myth? It was apparently impossible for the Soviets' S-75 missile to hit a target flying at above 70,000 feet as the U-2 was. Nor did they have the guidance and control capacity to hit the plane even if a rocket existed which could get that high with any semblance of accuracy. The film shows the plane crashing nose-downward, which contradicts the official report that it crashed nose-upwards. But it appears that the truth is it never crashed, and merely landed normally, as part of a complex and mysterious political plot. It has been suggested that this was to derail détente, but that may not be the whole story. There are other ambiguities regarding Powers himself. There seems to be no certainty as to his birthplace. In the 1960s he was said to be from Pound, Virginia, but on Wikipedia it says Jenkins, Kentucky, or perhaps Burdine, Kentucky. All three places are near one another on the Kentucky-Virginia border, and I used to know the area well. In the old days, apart from Highway 23, there was nothing but dirt tracks. The region is one of the wildest and most remote in the entire Appalachians. I have spent many, many weeks there in the distant past. The area was populated almost entirely by genuine hillbillies, who lived in log cabins and still hunted with flintlock rifles. I know this because I met them as a child, entered their log cabins, and held their flintlocks. I was not allowed to fire one because the gunpowder was precious and they cast their own lead ball shot from an iron mould. But the boy who let me hold and aim his own precious flintlock, which had an immensely long barrel and had 'belonged to my great-great-great-grand-pappy', was from about 1800 or even earlier. Using it, the family got most of their wild meat. The boy told me, in words I shall never forget: 'I can shoot the head off a squirrel at a hundred yards with my flintlock.' It was from this wild area that Powers was supposed to have originated, as well as another well known and notorious CIA-linked figure. (The coincidence of two major spy figures coming from the same dot on the map is impossible.) I also knew as a child a genuine local man who told me the CIA and FBI both had a special connection with Pound, Virginia, and that he had been hired himself by the FBI to do messenger work across the South and to report regularly to Pound. When Powers died mysteriously in 1977, many people thought he had been murdered. So all of these matters are extremely murky, and we shall probably never know the real truth about any of it. As for the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, I do not know what the film's agenda is for showing him as a quiet gentle, thoughtful, and artistic man, who is repeatedly described as 'honourable'. Why also is the entire American population shown in the film as foaming-at-the-mouth McCarthyites who want to lynch Abel and Donovan? Are Soviet spies being set up as the new heroes? What is going on with this film? The idea that the supposedly naive insurance lawyer Donovan would be taken to see Allen Dulles, who would tell him he could carry out his own private negotiations with the Soviets at the height of the Cold War involving a spy and a captured pilot, is totally and outrageously ludicrous. Donovan had been part of the legal team at Nuremberg and must have had intelligence affiliations already in the 1940s. Rudolf Abel (aka Willie Fisher) appears to have been a failure as a Soviet spy in America, and it defies belief that the Soviets would exchange a high-value captured American airman for him. The suspicion is that the American and Soviet security services cooperated secretly, with or without the knowledge of their own governments, to stage these phoney events. The film does not make clear that Abel had been in jail for four years before the swap for Powers, and was hence 'old news'. The film maintains that the East Germans resented and defied the Soviets, which is absurd, since East Germany was the most supine and devoted Soviet satellite state in the entire Warsaw Pact. If the Germans had behaved as shown in the film, they would have been summarily executed. Why are we expected to swallow all this nonsense? The direction of the film by Stephen Spielberg is superb, and the performances by Tom Hanks as the lawyer Donovan and Mark Rylance as Abel are outstanding in every way. (Powers features only as a minor figure in the two parallel stories shown here, which only come together with the spy swap on the bridge in Berlin.) But how much better and more interesting the film would have been if it had been accurate, and had explored the many mysterious byways and unanswered enigmas and contradictions. Instead, it adds to the existing, enormous disinformation overload.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Bridge of Spies,"New York attorney James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is drafted in to provide what can only be described as a cursory defence for alleged Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) whom the establishment want to offer an ostensibly open and fair, but actually only a rather rudimentary, trial. This doesn't sit well with Donovan, and he manages to get the judge to commute the death sentence to one of thirty years. That proves to be visionary because shortly afterwards, US pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) is off doing a little spying of his own when he is shot down over East Germany. Donovan is now drafted in by his government to travel to Berlin, without formal status, and see if he can't negotiate a prisoner swap. What now ensues is a true story that wouldn't look out of place in a John le Carré novel. Lots of dogma-driven mistrust, manipulation and a fair smattering of who needs to win the PR battle - especially complicated when the East Germans take a student hostage and he must now try to get both out - a two for one deal! Hanks is on good form delivering a measured and considered effort as the ingenious lawyer with a conscience, and Rylance also performs well, if really too sparingly, as the prisoner who is also a man of principle - though slightly less sure of the nature of his welcome at home should Donovan succeed. The film looks good, is nicely scored by Thomas Newman and we get a genuine sense of just how battered Berlin was as the wall started to go up. Perhaps a little on the lengthy side - but still a solid piece of biopic cinema well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Nuanced,"Especially with his adult entries, Steven Spielberg has made a claim for being perhaps America's most elegant filmmaker, with shrewd choices in material coupled with effective storytelling skills highlighted by precise framing and expert use of tracking cameras (in collaboration with his superb cinematographer Janusz Kaminski). ""Bridge Of Spies"", while not quite reaching the Hitchcockian suspense and psychological depth of ""Munich"", nonetheless is a very fine example of Spielberg working with commitment and intensity to provide the mature film-goer a satisfying, thoughtful experience. Here, the Cold-War plot (based on true events) is fairly cut-and-dried: a Russian spy (Mark Rylance), unsuccessfully defended by attorney Tom Hanks, is used as a negotiating tool to retrieve downed spy pilot Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) and, against the wishes of the CIA spook (Scott Shepherd) fronting the mission in Berlin, a student trapped on the other side of the Wall (Will Rogers). Working from a beautifully written script by Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers (supressing their smarm for a change), Spielberg underplays the action, working off body and facial nuance and well-timed, eloquent dialogue. The performers act with grace, particularly Hanks, continuing his transformation into the elder statesman of Hollywood film, and Rylance, whose placidity in the face of abandonment and death is appealing and entertaining. The only thing marring the film is Thomas Newton's score: while understated, it appears at inappropriate moments, distracting from the action on screen. But this is a minor quibble. The overall result is plausible and accessible--a very admirable addition to the impressive yet under-appreciated Spielberg canon.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Not Quite,"I have enjoyed Tom Hanks' transition from average comedic actor to top line dramatic actor so the juices were flowing at the chance to watch him in a political/war drama.Unfortunately the film never really delivers the punch that it could have.

Naturally the Air Force Loves It--Bad History,"One reviewer saw this movie with Air Force brass, who naturally loved it, but almost everything related to the 1950s U-2 program is flat wrong without any obvious reason for the errors. President Eisenhower specifically directed the CIA to develop and manage the program with ""civilian"" pilots to avoid committing acts of war by sending military aircraft over foreign countries. Pilots were required to resign from the Air Force, certainly didn't wear uniforms, and were trained at Area 51 (now officially acknowledged) and certainly not in Peshawar Pakistan. Only accurate bits were the grease pencil number on Powers' helmet (they were obviously custom fitted) and the fact that he couldn't destroy the cameras because he got sucked out of the cockpit. All that being said: a great story, great character study, great acting, great if momentary homage to the immortal Billy Wilder and his much more accurate depiction of 1961 Berlin: ""Eins, Zwei, Drei"" aka ""One Two Three."" Wilder too presents German dialogue without subtitles, but with him it's much funnier and no less pointed.Well worth watching, especially for Hanks and Rylance, but keep in mind that its no more ""history"" than Oliver Stone's ""JFK."" (JFK got shot, Powers got shot down and swapped for Abel.) BTW: Powers got screwed by both the CIA and Air Force, with Kelly Johnson of Lockheed's Skunk Works the only person to stand by him. That's why he wound up flying a traffic copter and running out of gas in 1977. I was there in 2000 when Brigadier General Kevin Chilton, commanding the USAF 9th Reconnaissance Wing at Beale Air Force Base in northern California, gave his son Gary Jr those medals as a way of assuaging the government's guilty conscience.",8.0,Anonymous,History

This is how you do it..,Bridge of spies is based on a true historical event. When Rudolph Abel is caught sending secrets to the Soviet Union and is found out to be a spy Abel needed a lawyer and when no one came forward to do it. One lawyer named James Donovan was appointed. Donovan formerly a criminal lawyer and had served at the Nazi war trials had settled down and became a Insurance lawyer. Donovan doesn't want it. But it becomes clear to him that the case has already been tried and Abel found guilty in a court of public opinion. Donovan decides to do his best to win by any means Legal. This makes him a target in many quarters and unpopular. In an age where anti communist feelings ran high. The case was done in a highly illegal manner and Abel found guilty. Donovan however found a way to save Abel's life by suggesting that he may be useful in the future if say a American Spy had been caught. In this Donovan was smart and foretelling the future because that is what happened. Francis Gary Powers and A young medical student are captured as spies Powers for his failed U2 flight in which he got caught shot down and Pryor for being on the wrong side of the Berlin wall. the U.S. Government wanting to secure the release of both men but not seem involved ask Donovan to work for them but Publicly Donovan works for himself his mission get Powers home. Donovan finds out about Pryor and is determined that Both men come home. Donovan is on his own. no gadgets no tools no back up a lot of handlers watching him and giving him orders which he ignores some he takes seriously but over all he refuses to give up on Powers of Pryor. both men he insists are innocent and are coming home. Alone in a strange country not speaking the language and scared Donovan does the impossible. And that is the movie in every bit of glory. This humble man that would never think of himself as a hero is one. And this man who does the impossible wants one thing to go home and get rid of his cold.This just may be the best spy movie to come out of the last 35 years . and it also is tom Hanks best. Mark Rylance shines as Abel the unworried spy who becomes a pillar of strength to Donovan in the darkest points of the trial. You're not worried Donovan asks him and his reply is a classic No should I be ? would it help if I was ?These are the things movie gold is made of.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Totally one-sided,"I think the movie is one sided. We never get to see the Soviet's perspective. I can feel the tension in the movie before the exchange and in the trial scenes, but i dont think the movie shows everything that there is. It just shows how much the Americans hate the Russians. I can also say that, people who watch the movie i.e, people from other country will get the wrong idea fro sure. I don't know how historically correct this movie is, but this movie might spread the wrong idea. Just because they are Russians it doesn't mean that they are bad people. I wish this movie was taken with both their perspective in mind and presented in such a way that the audience so that we can better understand the situation on both sides. The Russian side of the story is neglected. I know this is not the actual plot but may be i dont know i feel like the movie is too one-sided.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Really well made Cold War true story,"'Bridge of Spies' is an espionage thriller at its finest. It's set in the late 50s & early 60s and certainly looks the part - I always love seeing the old cars driving around New York, looking classy. Starts off like any classic spy film, but then Abel (Rylance) is caught. In comes Donovan (Hanks), an insurance lawyer who is asked to defend Abel, so he can receive due legal practice. The first 45min or so is a good courtroom drama and moves along fast enough, with Hanks giving a few great speeches and making some solid points about what's right and what's best.The movie really captures well the Cold War tension in America and what families would've gone through. It helps that this is the best film Spielberg has made in a few years and the best film Hanks has been in for a while. Once the movie turns into political chess, with an exchange of Abel for Powers (Stowell) in Berlin, the stakes are raised and there's plenty of great subterfuge.Hanks basically owns the film, with everyone having some good moments (especially Rylance, with his ""would it help?""s), but he really plays a great everyman who stands up to both Germany, Russia & his own country (mostly portrayed by the CIA/Shepherd) for what is morally right and just, not just what is politically acceptable at the current time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Who do you trust? Can you trust anyone?,"Thrown directly into the height of the Cold War you begin to grasp the hardships seen and the high tensions of nations. The movie tells the true story of a captured man believed to be a Russian spy and his exchange for an American soldier and an American student held captive. James Donovan, an insurance lawyer, is given the role of defending the believed Russian spy in the court of law. Can he save both of the Americans and is the Russian truly a spy or just a man trying to go home?The movie gives the audience the feeling of being tense and put in a period of where super nations are on the brink of war. You are never able to really trust anyone while watching this movie and that is something enjoyable to many. The suspense of never knowing who to trust and what may set off World War III.Overall, I thought Spielberg and Hanks did an excellent job of extracting raw emotions from the audience in this movie. It was not was I was expecting in the movie, but that did not change the enjoyment. They did an excellent job of telling the story of a man caught up in dangerous territory and his ability to never back down.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The character of Abel is made to be world weary, but without evidence of his cleverness as a spy it's less interesting as a Cold War tale.I learned a lot about the Colonel writing a NY Times story about his life posing in Brooklyn as an artist, and then I requested his interrogation transcripts from the FBI, which they sent me in several boxes running to 3,000 pages.

Cinematic Gold,"""Bridge of Spies"" is a film directed by Steven Spielberg. For some these days, that may not be persuasive enough to buy a ticket so let me say it is crafted to make a historical event come alive on screen. It stars Tom Hanks but doesn't rely on his huge appeal. Hanks lets the story play out on its own without grandstanding with his character. There's an excellent cast with him and they all work together to make this film amazing.There is so much to enjoy here. It's first of all interesting because it is a true story. Second, it heralds the accused's right to a solid defense. There is much here about negotiations in and out of country. It's also a period piece replete with authentic props and there is a remarkable conclusion one may or may not expect.""Bridge of Spies"" is top notch storytelling about an event that should be remembered from the cold war. A couple questions are addressed:How can people thought of as evil make grand gestures of humanity? Why should we put effort into defending the rights of those such as a foreign spy?There are parts of those questions that require a long telling so the length of the movie may put off some. I was bored at times but I kept regaining interest. If one can keep ones attention span alive between the slower scenes, ""Bridge of Spies"" has many engaging moments and a most intriguing payoff.

Topical Message is Too Profound to be Delivered So Dry and Deliberate,"So, more than a Decade after ""The Patriot Act"" and every Non Neo-Con in the Country weighed in with Loud and Convincing Arguments about ""The Constitution"", ""The Bill of Rights"", and the foundation of the Country's ""American Values"" at Risk, what with Torture now being called ""Enhanced Interrogation Techniques"", and so forth, Spielberg and His ""Band of Brothers"" have made a Film with the same Arguments.Everyone falling all over Themselves about this ""High Moral Ground"" Movie, where have you been? Tom Hanks, the Coen Brothers, and others Contribute to this A-List Film and all should be Commended for Their Contribution. Mark Rylance as Abel, the Soviet Spy (true story) Deserves His Oscar Credit.But the Nomination for Best Film of the Year by the Oscars. Hardly. The Film is Peppered with Spicy Scenes that Intrigue but Interest Wanes now and then with the Lethargic Pace and Dry Composition. The Message is Obvious but why Deliver it in such a Matter of Fact, Drawn Out, Lengthy Story that Sputters at times.This is one of those that the Parts are much Better than the Whole Thing and this Thing is surely Professional Artisism at its Highest Level, but as a Profound Picture with a Heavy Political and Topical Message. Not so much.It Misses the Mark and that is to Package the Content in a Gripping and Unforgettable Film that can not be Overlooked by the Masses.

"Entertaining, but largely US Propaganda","What starts as an entertaining tale about a lawyer defending a possible Soviet spy becomes a spectacle about US exceptionalism.Used to be a time I could watch these movies naively believing it to be an accurate depiction of the events. But, in reality the depiction of Soviets as brutal authoritarian government in the movie, torturing POW soldiers for information - while in contrast the US govt is seen handling the Soviet POW with care.The timing of the release of this movie is funny, considering this was at the height of public revelations of US waterboarding POWs in Iraq and Afghanistan.Overall, the movie is entertaining but it plays out as a jingoistic depiction of American virtues.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Bridge of Spies was another compelling Tom Hanks-Steven Spielberg film,"I finally watched this Steven Spielberg-directed drama starring Tom Hanks on Netflix disc with my mom just now. We were both enthralled by this based on a true story of Hanks' James Donovan-an insurance lawyer who previously was involved in the Nuremberg trials-and his attempt to first defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance who gave a performance worthy of his Oscar win) and then fostering an exchange with Russia and East Germany to trade Abel for pilot Francis Gary Powers and student Frederic Pryor, respectively. It was fascinating finding out later how much of the movie was historically accurate, turns out quite a bit. Some scenes would be considered shocking but this was mostly carried by compelling dialogue of which much of it was by Joel and Ethan Coen. So on that note, me and Mom highly recommend Bridge of Spies.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Hanks delivers again in a memorable role...!,"Thank goodness Hanks continues to pick juicy, meaningful roles to play after 30 years of memorable film-making (ok: his chubby corrupt ELVIS manager wasn't so great.. but no one bats 1.000 in this game).Hanks here plays Jim Donavan, the NY insurance lawyer designated to negotiate an exchange of a convicted Russian spy (whom he had defended in court) for Gary Powers, an American pilot shot down in Soviet territory. Not so easy to do walking around a recently-bricked up city of East Berlin. STASI (East-German nasty secret police) and the KGB were ruthless & unpredictable.Hanks portrays a firm, but fair man in an under-stated but convincing manner. Other actors are at top of their game, as well. Since most 'kids' under 30 are scant in their knowledge of the COLD WAR, I almost think the film should be 'must-view' in High School history classes!Excellent 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Enjoyable but not a classic.,"Bridge of Spies has the feel an old fashioned drama and has all the hallmarks of a Steven Spielberg film. The attention to detail , the charismatic leading man ( Hanks ) and the sentimentality . There's nothing not to like about this film but is that enough to make it great ? Probably not. Although Tom Hanks is excellent I think the standout performance is from Mark Rylance who plays the Russian spy , Rudolf Abel . His understated dour acting is brilliant to watch. If you are expecting an action thriller then you will be disappointed. It's not that type of film. This is pure drama and an enjoyable one at that.

Why did I wait so long for this movie?,"Bridge of Spies. I hate that I waited so long to see this movie. It is so amazing. Stick around and see how so.Synopsis: In the cold war, a lawyer, James B. Donovan is recruited by the CIA and involved in an intense negotiation mission to release and exchange a CIA U-2 spy-plane pilot, Francis G. Powers. The pilot was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission and stays in the company of a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel, who was arrested for espionage in the US. Starring: Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance Director: Steven SpielbergFirst thing is, there is hardly anything wrong with this movie. The only downfall is the fact that it ran two minutes longer than it should have. Just a mere two minutes was the matter of this movie being a 10 or a 9. Throughout Tom Hanks' character's whole time in Germany he was saying all he wanted to do was get home to his bed. When that happened at the end of the movie it should have just ended there. There was no need to show that people respected his character after he got back. Falling onto his bed and going to sleep was enough in my opinion.Now that we got the one bad thing out of the way, let's talk about the best thing of the movie. Mark Rylance did deserve the best supporting actor for his role. He was so amazing in this movie. Was he a spy or not? Yes, the truth has come out and he was a spy, but nobody knew that at the time. The way Rylance played it off as if you couldn't tell was superb. If he see this movie for anything watch it for Rylance's performance.Tom Hanks in this movie was as amazing as he always is. Well, after he stopped doing those romance movies. And outside the two I have mentioned, there was no one who stood out. That's okay. The whole situation was about how Donovan treated Abel respectfully and worked over the Russians and Germans to get what the U.S. needed.Unlike a lot of Spielberg's movies in the last twenty years this one did not have a pacing problem. Even though it was nearly two and a half hours long it didn't feel that way. You are so entranced in the story that you don't realize you were sitting there for two hours and then the movie is over.How this movie didn't win more awards is beyond me. It was so good. This is one of those movies that will stand the test of time. I guarantee it. Watch it.Rating: 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,History
A realistic and stressful drama!,"It is not that common a movie absorbs you with its story, but when it does, you could feel living inside it and experience it as it goes. Tom Hanks' acting is as good as ever and Mark Rylance's performance is absolutely incredible for which he won the academy Awards for best actor in a supporting role.
It's a movie about legal confidentiality in the years of the cold war, before Berlin's wall was broken. East Germany is highly under the Soviet union's influence, and a lawyer is responsible for trading lives between US, USSR and East Germany.
It's easy to watch as the rhythm of the movie never slows down more than a few seconds. Music is adequately good for the movie, Oscar Nominated.
I've never been a fan of Coen Brothers, and I've seen many of their originals. I liked their screenplay for this movie better than the others. Steven Spielberg's patriotism once again is dominating in this movie.
So, if you are one of those people who'd enjoy watching a movie based on a true story, full of dialogues, monologues, great acting, good music, and a lot of nervousness, this is your type of movie. I deducted a few points for I'd never watch this movie again, didn't love the directing, and I think there were unnecessary exaggeration in some scenes.
However, I loved that you'll know about the situation and what is going on in many scenes just as the protagonist knows and understands: if he's waiting, you're waiting, if he's scared, you're scared, and if he's nervous about what is going to happen, you'd feel the same. The amount of empathy you'd feel for this movie's characters is very much in many scenes. Other scenes, on the contrary, somehow hard to feel any empathy.All in all, watch this movie, there's a reason it's been nominated for many awards, and as much as Spielberg's involvement, the quality of production is never below a certain point which makes it, still, a good movie to enjoy and a good story to listen to.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Felt like it was directed by a committee.,"This is worth watching for the acting. Hanks and especially Rylance were masterful. Their characters carried the film. I kept wanting more, to hear how these honorable men, in opposite enemy camps planning to blow up the World, each doing their duty for beliefs and country, learn to know and like each other. Alas, this film hinted at the depth of their relationship but could have showed so much more.Rather, like a parasitic over-the-top twin, the movie within a movie interrupted the story. The U-2 pilot was more Millennium Falcon than Air Force, the U-2 special effects more ""Gravity"" than realistic high altitude ejection, and the U-2 training--OJT rather than classroom, made me laugh when humor was not intended.Some of the plot points felt gimmicky so I read up on the history after watching, and the film did take some literary license with several of the historical details. Although some were clearly worth the payoff to maintain tension, some struck me as more distracting than dramatic. The sense of place and feeling of the Cold War comes through, but don't watch this film to prep for a history test.Overall, the storytelling, pacing, and acting -- especially the two lead characters, make this well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Bridge of Spies - realistic cold war drama done by the masters of the craft,"I had the privilege of going to view the new Stephen Spielberg drama ""Bridge of Spies"" on it's opening night in Australia on 22nd October 2015. I sat in my armchair premium seating at the theater and went on an intriguing ride. This is historical drama at it's best, directed by the master of the craft Stephen Spielberg starring Tom Hanks as the lead character ""James Donovan"", who does a splendid job in a role suited to him, just an ordinary everyday honest man that has to do the extraordinary. This is not an action film but a true historical drama told with suspenseful story telling and wit. Many of scenes were shot in the actual places in Germany were the true events took place which added to realism. You can feel the American paranoia and intrigue at a time when the world stood closer to blowing itself up in a nuclear holocaust than it ever has been, it has clever plot turns and twists and maintains an easy to follow story that at times has you on the edge of your seat. This is a movie for intelligent people who want realistic entertainment that does not require ""suspension of disbelief"", its just plain old fashioned good story telling and comes highly recommended, it is Academy Award winning material.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Pretty boring in places! 5/10,"Review: It's not very often that I can say a bad word about a Spielberg/Hanks collaboration but in this case, I have to say that I found this movie pretty boring. Although the subject matter was deep and emotional, I found the pace of the film, extremely slow and it just seemed to be going round in circles most of the time. Tom Hanks (James B. Donovan) and Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel) played there roles extremely well and they made the movie slightly watchable but I still struggled to keep my eyes open, through the negotiating scenes between Hanks, the Germans and the Russians. On the plus side, the whole look and feel of the film is top class and the period was filmed well by one of the best directors of all time but after the disappointing movie, War Horse, I was expecting more from this movie. The whole ""Russian Spy"" concept wasn't really shocking, even though it was based on true events, and the outcome of Donovan's actions was more interesting than the film. The fact that Abel was actually a spy, seemed to be overlooked and you don't get to see what problems his actions had caused in the past. Anyway, although the movie looked top class, I didn't really find it that entertaining and I won't be rushing to watch the movie again. Average!Round-Up: Steven Spielberg, 69, is one of those directors that people will flock to the cinemas to watch his movies, and when he teams up with Hanks, in movies like the Terminal, Saving Private Ryan and Catch Me If You Can, the collaboration usually works. To date, Spielbergs new movie, the BFG, has made $153million but it cost $140million to make so it has just about broken even. Its been a long time since this brilliant director has pulled off anything amazing but he will always be remembered for movies like Jaws, Close Encounters, the Indiana franchise, E.T., the Colour Purple, Jurassic Park etc. With another Indiana Jones and West Side Story, rumoured to be his next projects, I still find it quite surprising that he has only won 3 Oscars, 2 for Schindler's List and one for Saving Private Ryan but I'm sure he will get a lifetime achievement award for his contribution to cinema. His vision and amazing storytelling skills are truly unique but this film definitely wasn't one of his best. Tom Hanks has also gone a bit downhill lately but that is mostly due to the movies that he has chosen, and not his superb acting skills. Anyway, although I found this movie pretty boring, I'm sure that there is a market for this subject matter and it must have touched many hearts.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $165millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/history/thrillers, starring Tom Hanks, Mark Rylance, Domenick Lombardozzi, Brian Hutchison, Alan Alda and Amy Ryan. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,History
Spielberg and Hanks do it again,"Has a director Steven Spielberg never ceases to amaze me, so does Tom Hanks as an actor. It's 2 hours and 20 minutes, but because it's so well paced it never feels likes it is that long. The film really shows how politics where in the late 50's, a somewhat crazy era.James Donovan(Tom Hanks) a lawyer who is defending an immigrant named Adel(Mark Rylance) who is suspected of being a spy, even though Donovan encounters a lot of hatred by a lot of people for taking the case.There is a lot more to the movie in which I don't want to spoil. It feels like a two parter of a movie. Hanks really delivers in his performance, I like the way he never backs down, in the face of all the hatred he endures. His determination is what keeps the movie going. Spielberg also shows the greatness of the director that he is. Really capturing the era of that time. I feel the film goes beyond just being a cold war thriller.",10.0,Anonymous,History
We're Going To Miss Spielberg,"We're going to really miss Spielberg when he retires. IF he retires. This is craft to the highest form. And the attention to every detail is sorely lacking in movies. Craft is IMPOSSIBLE to relate to movie makers today, because it's when talent meets instinct. And we lack instinct.The story is of Tom Hanks who plays defense attorney James Donovan, that deals with insurance policies. As we're introduced in the beginning, he does what every defense attorney does, he spins the truth to meet his client's point. It's a little scheisty, but he's clearly effective. This gathers the attention of his boss, who assigns him the duty to defend an alleged Soviet spy. I don't even believe in due process, unless I'm bustedof course, but he is entitled to a ""fair"" trial. If that is even possible. The United States is under high alert in light of the Cold War (Muslims anyone?) and Germany is rebuildingsort of. With the freeze out of the Russians who've gone deep into secrecy. Were we ever friends? So, now we got a captured Ruskiewhat happens? Well, don't want to give away too much. But he is exactly how we imagine someone captured should act who comes from the Eastern Block. Cold, detached and resigned to their fate.So, now as advertised, we get a spy exchange. But who does it? The C.I.A. washes their hands of the issue. The State Department don't want to be involved? Well, they wrangle Donovan into the mission. Except, it's not a mission. Because if caught or killed Donovan is on his own. Because of the freeze out (literally) of Berlin, and the historical split to East and West, they aren't playing games.The movie isn't the most exciting. Espionage, in the truest sense, would most likely be a lot of waiting. But this moves at a really nice clip and because of craftyou watch every beautiful frame with anticipation of the next visual (beautifully shot on film by Janusz Kaminski).This is a movie that only professionals put together. The minute you watch, you know the people who made it are skilled. There is an easiness, practically effortless (looks like) storytelling. They let the moments between the family develop. The intricacies of our diplomacy made simple despite the thick fog of friends and enemies. A classy sophisticated movie. It's high art.",9.0,Anonymous,History

It is a John LeCarré movie,"Had somebody told me if it was LeCarré and not Steven Spielberg, I would have believed it. Steven Spielberg is a great storyteller, but LeCarré, well for me, is the pinnacle for anything to do with spy & espionage. With that being said, this movie doesn't fall under spy or espionage category. The story is more towards realpolitik. It was the spy who reminded me about all those characters from LeCarré novels.The partnership between Stephen Spielberg & Tom Hanks has always provided brilliant narratives. Tom Hanks, as always is brilliant. James Donovan is s New York lawyer, a family man. A very satisfying performance by Tom Hanks.This was easily outdone by Mark Rylance as Rudolf Abel. Watching him on screen, I wonder why haven't I watched his previous movies. Will he continue with mainstream cinema? His character, the way it was portrayed is similar to Alec Guinness in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. There it is, another reference to John LeCarré (Apologies, this would be my last. It would be unfair to compare).When Rylance was on screen, he was the lead. Not even Tom Hanks is noticeable. Such a powerful performance by Rylance. Rudolf Abel understands he has fallen into the hands of his enemy who would stop at nothing but end his life. There is absolutely no hope, even the civilians want him done. Rylance brilliantly brings this out, his eyes and body do most of the acting.There are three stars in this movie – Tom Hanks, the story. Both which have been easily outdone by Mark Rylance.As the movie progresses, you can not help but wonder with everything falling in place, it should be one of those spy kids movies made for mature audience with the basic underlying story. The process of sentencing Rudolf was so swift hardly anytime before he was sentenced. But again that can be understood. The entire nation wants him dead and the writers want to stick to the main story, appreciated.The negotiations between Donavan, The Soviets & East Germans were too fast. Negotiations between 2 super powers over a very sensitive issue, which could have been disrupted or delayed considerably by the home nation – East Germany, gets resolved with ease. Just like that. Poof. It looked more like everything fell in place for Donavon. Even though that was not key to the movie, it does take out some charm off it.Everything said, the makers have made brilliant effort to turn it right. It is a really enjoyable movie. Someday looking forward to renting it at home and watching it again the way I like. Rewind few scenes, pause at few scenes. Get completely absorbed.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"""Standing Man, Standing Man""","Steven Spielberg is one of Hollywood's most prolific Directors. He does not have the best track record and yet he creates far more great films than poor ones. It will come as little of a shock then that Bridge of Spies is a great film, with Spielberg on fine form, showcasing tremendous showmanship, craft and talent. Bridge of Spies bears the distinction of being his best film since Saving Private Ryan, so applause in this case is necessary.Based on a true story, Bridge of Spies is set in the fifties in America, during the time of the Cold War. James B Donovan works as a lawyer, but soon the CIA involves him with a suspected Soviet Spy by the name of Rudolf Abel. They ask Donovan to help Abel out in court. What they really mean is to make the proceedings look civilised and yet they all know that Abel does not have a hope in hell. That is until Donovan is willing to truly help him.What Bridge of Spies has really got going for it is an element of intrigue as well as a dash of surprise and suspense. How often is it that we get a film set in the fifties with the amount of drama, wit and excitement that Director Steven Spielberg and writers Joel and Ethan Coen can stir up in us? It's rare for a match between material, writers and director that is quite literally made in heaven. With Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance at the helm, Bridge of Spies is exceedingly well acted and I am not a loyal devotee of Hanks, but here oh my goodness how he shines like never before! His character has heart, warmth and humour. The most important aspects in making us love a character. He is not once misjudged. Thank the marvellous writing from the Coen Brothers for that one!Still considering the talent involved when you have the Coens on board, in all honesty I wanted Bridge of Spies to be a greater film than it actually amounts to. But don't get me wrong this is terrific film making. Yet there's something lacking. What is it? A sense of flowing momentum and precision. Which is all to do with the script. At first glance there's no problem to be had here. Yet upon further scrutiny it does not hold up. My main issue? We are shown scenes that do not need to be seen. They detract from the thrust of the story. We almost forget about Donovan and that's a crime itself. Luckily it's only for ten minutes at a time, but I must admit that these departures from the essence and heart of the story do hurt the film. It's also too long for its own good and I strongly suspect that Spielberg inflated the runtime so that the Academy would pay more attention to the film during awards season. The gamble does not pay off.But let's not get negative here. Bridge of Spies is no question or doubt in my mind an excellent film. Not perfect alas. But brilliant all the same. If anything its further proof that Steven Spielberg is the best at what he does in the business. Particularly if the subject matter is a) A Biopic b) centred around a well-drawn individual and c) about courage in the hardest to find places. Spielberg don't ever stop making movies while I'm around.B+",8.0,Anonymous,History

Hanks storms back to the top!,"Tom Hanks has found it difficult to replicate the kind of performance he produced for Forrest Gump, here he effortlessly matches it with his subtle portrayal of a lawyer who is cast adrift with a case that makes a pariah of him, but sends him on a relentless journey for the truth.Hanks, the perennial good guy epitomises all that is good in America at a time when it poisoned itself with Cold War fears. He defends a spy who is, well, a spy and finds he is defending a man who is as honourable as he is inscrutable. Because he is a man who is determined to make an honest job of a thankless situation, he finds himself drawn to his client and defends him to the bitter end.The plot is clearly drawn by wonderful writing from the Coen brothers, and the subplot of American spying closely following the case until the inevitable climax involving an exchange of spies is realistically told with spellbinding cinematography.Mark Rylance comes of age as a regular on the big screen and makes a convincing foil for the more eloquent Hanks.If this film does not become a serious Oscar contender I will eat my hat, and I am sure Spielberg will do the same.A must see.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Spielberg dish, seasoned with Coen spices","Who would ever have thought that the Coen Brothers would co-write a film directed by Steven Spielberg? At first sight, it seems a very improbable combination. On the one hand the traditional Hollywood giant of blockbuster fame, and on the other hand the unruly creators of weird characters and unorthodox stories.This could have been a disaster: a terrible clash of two styles of film making. But in fact, it is a wonderful cooperation. The film is mostly made according to the standard Spielberg recipe of big drama, but seasoned with some very tasteful spices of Coen-like creativity and dry humour.I think I recognized some very clear Coen-moments in the film. At one point the hero of the story, American lawyer James Donovan, walks into the Russian embassy in Berlin hoping to meet an official called Mr Vogel, but instead is greeted by a bunch of rumpled peasants. This is, I think, typical for the Coen Brothers. One other very recognizable Coen-moment is Donovan's visit to the East German prosecutor, who picks up the wrong phone. This whole scene is filmed in the slightly surrealistic way that characterizes many Coen-films'Bridge of Spies' is a cold war drama. It tells the true story of a righteous American lawyer who defends a Russian spy, learns to appreciate his professionalism and subsequently is asked to negotiate an exchange of prisoners in Berlin. The screenplay is very clever, with three spy stories woven into one narrative: the Russian spy in the US, an American pilot who is captured by the Russians after his plane is shot down, and an American student who happens to be in the wrong part of Berlin when the Wall is built.Sometimes Spielberg accentuates the dramatic effects a bit too much, for example when the student tries to leave the Eastern section of Berlin and sees how the last peace of concrete closes the Wall between him and the West. But on the whole this film is cinematographic craftsmanship at its very best. The screenplay keeps on introducing new, exciting story elements, the sober but effective acting by Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance is spot on, and the period sets recreate the Cold War era perfectly. It is hard not to like this film.",8.0,Anonymous,History

And despite Abel being a spy I really loved him and found him hilarious and the story of him regaining his freedom heart warming....

The movie has a great balance of seriousness and spicy comedy, kicking the audience every once in a while.The movie has a Hitchcockish opening. Camera moves smoothly and conveys the story most of the time perfectly. The comedy kicks in almost instantly and keeps you interested in otherwise grayish second act while going through the necessary clues to prepare us for the third act. At the second act you kind of feel like the story wasn't enough interesting to be a two and a half hour long.

An excellent character-driven movie about the Cold War,"This film ticked a lot of boxes for me. I am very fond of well-crafted spy movies, enjoy historical settings, love the acting of Mark Rylance and have a thing for intelligent screenplays. They are all here, plus Spielberg's renowned direction and a sterling performance by Tom Hanks in the lead role. The movie is doing well at the box office for which it can thank its bankable names and gripping main sequences - it's hard to go wrong with a high profile trial followed by a prisoner exchange, with some Cold War hysteria thrown in for good measure. All provide lots of tension without standing in the way of some very interesting character development. The relationship between Hanks and Rylance is really well managed. What great actors they both are: in their scenes together there is so much superb interaction in speech and body language. The New York and Berlin locations are exceptionally well recreated, a positive joy to watch. A lot of research, thought and professionalism have gone into this film. Some issues: not much material for the female lead to work with (blame that on the time setting), a bit of a sag in the transition between NYC and East Berlin, some clumsy humour (the so-called family and the delivery bikes in the corridor) and that trademark Spielberg sentimentality in the closing scenes.

One of the Best of Its Kind. An Unshowy Cold War Thriller,"The name Steven Spielberg is usually enough for many people, including myself, to get excited for a movie. Throw in Tom Hanks and a script written with the help of the Coen Brothers and you have an instant must see, right? Despite all the star power in the movie, I was still a little hesitant going into the movie because a couple of Spielberg's recent efforts in the 2000's haven't been up to par for him. That being said, I exited this movie with a new-found interest in Cold War politics and its effect on the people.The story Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), an assumed Soviet spy who is captured and given to James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer, in order to give Abel a fair trial in court before sending him to the electric chair. However, on the other side of the world in the Soviet Union, one of the United States' spies is captured by the Soviets. Both countries agree to exchange the spies for each other and James Donovan is brought in once again to negotiate the swap.The film does a good job at neither portraying the Soviets or Americans as the good guys and finding an unbiased standpoint between the two. Each character is portrayed expertly by their actors, but I was most impressed by Mark Rylance. Going into this movie, you already know that you are going to get a committed performance from Tom Hanks. Surprisingly, I thought that Rylance did an equal or even better job portraying Rudolph Abel. Rylance so effortlessly makes his character sympathetic and the poignant expressions and subtly in his performance is one of the best parts of this movie. Another surprising aspect of the movie was the large amount of humor. I guess I should have expected that coming from a script written by the Coen Brothers.My one complaint of the film would be that the American spy captured Soviets was not developed nearly as well as Rylance in the United States. I was unsure if I was supposed to feel sympathetic because he was an American or anger because he failed to carry out his job and allowed himself to be caught.Overall, Bridge of Spies is a masterfully crafted Cold War thriller with Spielberg beautifully showing the audience what he does best when at the helm. This is most definitely not a film for everyone, but those who appreciate an old-fashioned Hollywood thriller will find much enjoyment in the film.""You're not worried?""

Mostly Well-Made but Very Forgettable and a Little Slow,"Bridge of Spies is based on the true story of an insurance lawyer during the Cold War who is chosen to defend a Russian spy in court simply to give the man a fair trial, and he decides to take it too far. For the most part it's well presented, but it doesn't stand out as anything special.The plot is one that I think we've all seen before. There's someone who wants to help beyond his call of duty, so he does. It's not a bad plot line, but it's not a particularly good one. It's like a superhero movie without the capes. Although Bridge of Spies is much better than most superhero movies. It's not very well-paced all the time though, and it does drag a little pretty much throughout the entire movie. I always felt myself checking the remaining run time and wondering how the movie would find enough content to compensate for its 142 minute run time. It does, though, and I think that for the most part it did it well.The character development is just fine. Jim Donovan is just like any other main character in these kinds of movies: He wants to help people, and he overdoes it more than expected despite people not wanting him to. Other than him, there's hardly any focus on any other character, so in short, they're just fine. Nothing special, but not bad either.The acting is just fine too. Mark Rylance, who somehow won an Oscar for his performance, is such a minor character that he barely had enough time to showcase his skills as an actor. Sure, he's important to the story, but he has barely enough screen time to really be considered all that important. This is more of a personal issue that doesn't really affect my opinion of the movie, however, and is more directed at the Oscars themselves.Overall Bridge of Spies is a good movie. It's not fantastic, it's not great, it's just good. It's one of those movies that I just watched and will probably never watch again or think about really afterwards. It's pretty forgettable, actually. Nothing about it stood out in particular, it was just good. In the end I'd recommend this movie. Maybe you'll love it, maybe you'll hate it, and maybe you'll just like it. I can see why anyone would feel any of those ways.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"I teared up, on multiple occasions!","'BRIDGE OF SPIES': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Steven Spielberg's new Cold War drama film; about an American lawyer trying to arrange a prisoner swap, with the Soviet Union. The story is based on the 1960 U-2 incident; it was written by Matt Charman, and the Coen Brothers (marking the second film in a row, that was co-written but not directed by the brothers; following last year's 'UNBROKEN'). The movie stars Tom Hanks (in his 4th collaboration with Spielberg), and it costars Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan, Austin Stowell, Scott Shepherd, Jesse Plemons and Alan Alda. The film has received rave reviews from critics and moviegoers alike, and it's considered a likely Oscar contender, at next year's Academy Awards. I really enjoyed it.The film begins in 1957 Brooklyn, New York; where Rudolf Abel (Rylance) is arrested by FBI agents, and charged with conspiracy. An insurance lawyer, named James B. Donovan (Hanks), is hired as his defense. Donovan takes the job very seriously, despite a corrupt court system, and hatred from a biased public. Abel is convicted of all charges, but Donovan is able to convince the judge (Dakin Matthews) to spare his life; on the chance that Abel might prove valuable, as a bargaining tool with the USSR in the future. His predictions come true, when an American U-2 spy plane pilot (Stowell) is captured by the Soviet Union.The movie is extremely predictable, even if you're not familiar with the history behind it, but it's still very well made. Hanks gives another outstanding performance; and Rylance is very impressive as well, in his supporting role. The film is beautifully shot, edited and scored; it's classic Steven Spielberg (doing what he does best). I was especially moved by the movie, and teared up on multiple occasions.

Snail paced gray movie with no direction,"Quite surprised how mediocre this movie is!Great actors + Spielberg and a flop.Many negatives, I'm afraid...This movie is slow. Really slow. Hence 2h long. A quicker pace would have benefited the movie as a whole and cut it down to standard length.It's a gray movie. Gray upon gray and some more gray. Situation was difficult post WW2 but I find this constant gray unnecessary. It is a spy movie not a concentration camp movie.Actually it's not a spy movie, because nobody is spying anything, it's an attorney/court room movie but unfortunately nobody is doing any attorney work at all and there's no court room debate at all! And that's the main problem with this movie. It's about nothing!It's just people meeting and discussing casually some issues but never diving more than skin deep in the problem, if at all.Maybe you can earn an Oscar for just 10 min play while you say 2 lines, but this was far from it. Springs to mind Tom Cruise in Tropic Thunder but Cruise wasn't even credited for his appearance!An interesting story butchered by lack of direction.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Spielberg on Autopilot,"The movie is well-acted, beautifully written, and filled with an engrossing plot.

"Bridge of Spies dazzles with its Oscar-winning performances and impressive true story. It's a little slow for me personally, but still, a movie I recommend.","While Bridge of Spies might not be my usual taste, its performances are undeniable, and its directing is masterful. Spielberg always creates incredible work, and Bridge of Spies is no different. This true story is filled with espionage, tense world powers, and political maneuvering, all colliding with one man and his strong integrity and convictions. Tom Hanks reunites with Spielberg bringing heart and authenticity to the role, but the real stand out of this film is Mark Rylance. His performance as the embattled Rudolf Abel, a questionable spy but seemingly good man, is stunning and worthy of the Oscar he won for the role.

Spielberg (almost) Does It Again,"Steven Spielberg, the Oscar winning producer and director of such masterpieces as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List has been a household name for decades, and with good reason. One expects a Spielberg film to be a huge box office success while receiving numerous award nominations, but not everything he touches turns to solid gold (Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull anyone?) With Bridge of Spies, the new Cold War thriller starring Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance, Spielberg has given us another fine film worthy of attention and accolades although he is just shy of being at the top of his game. Handed a screenplay co-written by Matt Charmin and Oscar winners Joel and Ethan Coen, Spielberg has assembled a top notch cast and a stunning and much heralded design team. Each contributes work worthy of merit to the film, but the pieces don't always fit together quite right in the final product.Set in 1957 during the Cold War, Bridge of Spies is inspired by the true story of Insurance Attorney James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks/Philadelphia, Forrest Gump). Donovan was assigned to defend captured Russian spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance/The Gunman, Days and Nights) in court in order to prove that the US is fair, affording a POW all of the same rights as any American subject to due process.

The Cold War was a time where people could not trust anyone, you were either a spy, having to keep secrets, or just a normal human. The acting in Bridge of Spies was not the best ever but it got to the point and wasn't the worst that I have ever seen. This movie well represents how sometimes people have to do things their community don't agree with to get them the best outcome in the future.

It's an Actual Bridge They Take Two Hours to Build To,"Tom Hanks. Dreamworks Entertainment. Need I say more? This picture was corny.Bridge of Spies follows the true story of a Cold War era insurance lawyer called upon by his country to first defend and then later negotiate the exchange of Soviet spy Rudolph Abel, who looks and sounds weirdly like Sean Connery. Hanks (Mr. Mom, Sully) reprises his reluctant hero role from the Dan Brown series as Jim Donovan, an ordinary man thrust into extraordinary circumstances. It had that True Lies if-they-only-knew element to it.The KGB character was played sympathetically, replete with his own catch phrase (was that really necessary?). The closest thing this film has to an antagonist is Donovan's CIA handler. He's ""mean,"" because he doesn't abuse the trust placed in him the way Donovan does, changing mission prerogatives on a personal whim because believes he knows better. The object is an American student being held for sedition by the East Germans. Hanks wants to take him back. The Americans don't value him. So, Hanks hijacks his own hostage swap to make the kid part of the deal. Patriotism is one of the themes, along with loyalty and reputation.This film could have used more spycraft and intrigue. They could have done a lot more with the story. Suspense and courtroom drama were missing. The plot focuses on the character's personal life, without fleshing it out. Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone, Birdman) shines as the wife, but it's a bit part. Donovan's family bares the brunt of public scorn for his defense of an infamous foreign operative. Donovan seems to be stating nonverbally that they'll get over it, it's for the greater good, without bothering to even say as much, against the backdrop of 20th Century nuclear fear. He's sacrificing in strong silence. Or whatever.Bridge of Spies wants to be a ""message movie"" but the didactic is fuzzy, at best. In defense of Abel, Hanks cites the US Constitution. This raises the question as to how the Constitution applies to the case at hand? I must have missed the part dealing with the rights of foreign nationals to spy on America. Donovan avoids the question by simply circulating back to the Constitution itself. It is because it is. Logic is not met with logic. Donovan is not a fighter for critical thinking.Someone recently called Matt Damon the ""Jimmy Stewart of the generation."" I would nominate Tom Hanks for that dubious honor. Methinks Mr. Spielberg should get with the times. The classic formula is less relevant in today's marketplace of media and devoid of creativity. It's cheese with a side of schmaltz.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"""Watch this man""","Quickie Review:When a Soviet spy (Mark Rylance) in the height of the Cold War is arrested, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) is recruited to defend him in an American trial. Meanwhile an American pilot is captured by the Soviets, thrusting Donovan into the responsibility of negotiating between two world powers on the brink of war. Bridge of Spies, balances the gravity of politics on a world stage with the relations and fears of the people behind it all. This film is yet another great example of what Spielberg and Hanks can achieve when they team up together. Will this be a classic from years to come? I expect not, but the quality of acting and directing is undeniable.Full Review:Considering Spielberg being one of the best directors and Hanks being one of the best actors in the Hollywood business, it is hard not to get excited for this movie. I'm not completely familiar with the real-world story, so I can't say much on the accuracy but on the movie of course I have my opinion to share.In terms of the performances, everybody was flawless but the clear stand-outs for me was Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. The character Donovan is unwavering when it comes to his duty as a lawyer, even when he has to defend an enemy of his country. He believes in the importance of unbiased justice, so strongly that at first it may come off as naïve. However, there are understated moments where we can see clearly his resolve being tested to the limits. Mark Rylance as the Soviet spy, is a man of few words but with that limitation he is able to convey so much about the character. He is defeated and fearful for his life, but when Donovan shows that there is still hope he will crack a joke. The key here is subtlety, that brings the power into the more dramatic moments without it feeling forced. I didn't feel like I was watching actors, I felt like I was watching real people.Another aspect that really grabbed my attention is the Cold War setting. It is of course the perfect time period for any political thriller story (a real one at that). Despite it being decades ago, it is hard not to see the parallels between the Cold War era and present day. We get to see the xenophobia in USA surrounding communists and Soviet spies, people quick to draw conclusions from their emotion. Could we really say things are any different now? Unfortunately not. So it is interesting how the movie feels relevant in modern day politics. The second half of the movie shows the delicate nature of negotiations. There are moments of manipulations, lies, and deceit. Yet through all that a trust has to be built to have any movement in the talks. How the characters try to build that relation for mutual benefit is what intrigued me the most.I only have one complain, that is it feels like two movies in one. The first half feels like legal drama, and the second half is a political thriller. So I would've liked more consistency between the two plot lines. Bridge of Spies, in the end achieves the authenticity in its characters and the setting. That's why I highly recommend seeing this movie. Personally, movies (not documentaries) that are based on real stories should prioritise authenticity and not accuracy. That I think are two very different things that deserves a whole entire post to explain.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A movie that accomplished what it was trying to do.,Bridge of Spies was a good movie. It was not the best I have seen but I don't think that was what it was going for. This movie accomplished exactly what it was doing and did it perfectly. The things I enjoyed about this movie was the relationship between James B. Donovan and Rudolf Abel. I enjoyed how they got along from the start and their relationship only grew stronger throughout the movie. I did not get to watch the complete movie but from what I saw it was decently bland for periods of time throughout the movie. I did like in the beginning when the group of guys chased Rudolf Abel throughout the city and tracked him down for the sheet of paper but he always had it hidden in strategic places and outsmarted them enough to keep the paper. The things I did not like about the movie were the boring parts of it or parts I did not see much meaning in but I also did not see after a few of those parts so my judgment could be changed if I see the rest of those parts. This is why I think Bridge of Spies is a good movie but not a great movie.,7.0,Anonymous,History
Bridge of Spies is a thrilling drama with a witty script.,"Steven Spielberg. Tom Hanks. Mark Rylance. Joel Coen. Ethan Coen. Five reasons to love this film. Spielberg's directing is top notch, Hanks and Rylance's acting's cutting edge and the Coen's writing adds comedy to a serious film. There are two parts to Bridge of Spies. First part sees Hanks' lawyer defending Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) during the Cold War. In the second part Hanks' James B. Donovan negotiates a prisoner exchange; Abel for a captured American pilot. The coming together of the cast and crew make Bridge of Spies a riveting watch. Tensions are constantly high, even though there's minimal action. The few jokes spread throughout make it no less thrilling. Mark Rylance and Hanks are superb. It's hard to say whether one outdoes the other when they share the screen time.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Beautifully Shot,"The first thing that struck me about Bridge of Spies was just how beautiful it was. The film is gorgeously shot, every frame seems like a painting.

It is a solid, well acted drama with an engaging story that won't leave fans of the genre disappointed.Overall I have nothing but good things to say about it and I would highly recommend it. There are however some minor nitpicks. The film strikes one as very good but it never rises to excellent when you get the feeling that it could have. The film is done by professionals who know their craft and thus the film is well polished but lacks that special spark, a deeper substance in the story that would make you love it instead of merely liking it, however much.Of course all of that could be merely a question of preference and for some this movie would be satisfying enough. Again, I have nothing bad to say against Bridge of Spies. I thoroughly enjoyed and have already included it in my list of top movies of 2015.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Would it help?,"This is a very creditable attempt at telling the real story of 'Rudolf Abel' and the Cold War shenanigans that happened after the Second World War. Rylance manages to give a slight Scot's accent to Abel who was in fact born near Newcastle Upon Tyne (i.e. he would have spoken with a Geordie dialect). Never mind, Rylance conveys with perfect restraint the imperturbable front any spy worth his salt ought to aspire. This compares starkly with the slightly inept attempt at 'keeping secrets' shown by his American swappee, Powers, when subjected to interrogation. Spielberg manages to apply rose tinted spectacles at strategic points but thankfully, not too detrimentally.

I just have to note that I had a real problem with the comment wielded at Tom Hanks' character at the beginning of the movie by the CIA agent over a drink: ""...don't go all Boy Scout on me..."" No one would have said that in 1957 and there were a few other similar inconsistencies...annoying.

Spielberg.....another masterpiece,"27 November 2015 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Bridge of Spies Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks reunite for this tale based on the true events resulting in Gary Powers and his U2 being shot down over the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. America had in their possession a man they believed to be a Russian spy and James B Donovan, an unassuming insurance lawyer was coerced into negotiating the exchange of the two men. This film was pure Spielberg. Extremely well shot using interesting angles to provide menace and intimidation, combined with writing provided by Matt Charman and the amazing Joel and Ethan Cohen, this film had me glued to my seat. It wasn't all action, it was gritty, moving, and in places even amusing. It was also very sobering as we were treated to scenes of the wall being built between East and West Germany and the desperation of people trying to cross before it was completed. The plane spotter part of me was happy to see the U2 being depicted (whether it was real or a model I don't know but it looked pretty good). I could easily watch this again. Superb performance from Tom Hanks and I really liked Mark Rylance, who played the 'Russian Spy' Rudolf Abel, spy or not his performance evoked empathy for the character.

Bridge of Spies - Movie Review,"James Donovan: ""Aren't you worried?""Rudolf Abel: ""Would it help?""Bridge of Spies takes place during the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.So I finally just watch Bridge of Spies and it was pretty damn good. Steven Spielberg once again made a great movie, and just like I said about Ridley Scott about how great it is that we still can go to the cinema today and see a new movie directed by an icon.Steven Spielberg is the type of director you never know what you're going to get and I'm talking about the type of film making he uses. Spielberg will always make a well directed movie even when some of his movies are not great or something you'll never watch again, it will still be well directed. Steven Spielberg's directing in Bridge of Spies was absolutely superb, because every scene is so perfectly crafted and Spielberg knows when to cut to a emotional reaction with the characters. These a couple of scenes in this movie that I didn't notice was all in one long wide take with no breaks, and that's because I was so locked in on what was going on with the characters and the scene itself. Spielberg brilliance is still present today as he's masterful style of film making is still alive today. If you love that kind of film making that's so masterful, perfect and old school, then Bridge of Spies might be the movie for you. This is one of the best directed films I've seen this year.Tom Hanks is one of the most lovable and respected actors of are times, as in every role he dose, he never disappoints. This is he's fourth collaboration with Spielberg after: Catch Me If You Can, Saving Private Ryan and The Terminal, and in Bridge of Spies Hanks once again deliverers a magnificent and believable performance. This is an Oscar worthy performance as he made his character so relatable, funny and very likable. Without spoiling anything, there's a scene in this movie where Tom Hanks character (James Donovan) gets followed by this unknown figure and at one point Donovan goes to sit at this restaurant to confront this man and the scene itself is just amazing, because Donovan knocks this guy to the ground with no action, just dialogue. Tom Hanks was amazing in this movie.Another performance that blow me away was Mark Rylance as the soviet spy. I have seen this actor before in the hit TV show ""Wolf Hall"", and he was great in that show, but he impressed the hell out of me in this movie, because Mark Rylance was absolutely fantastic. This guy deserves an Oscar nomination for best supporting actor and I hope he dose, because it would be a huge sub if he doesn't get nominated. Mark Rylance was fan-freaking-tastic in this movie.The cinematography was excellent, the score was great, the dialogue is outstanding and the story was really good.Now for the problems: These a couple of scenes around the second act that wasn't that interesting to me.If you don't like talky movies then you may not enjoy Bridge of Spies, because this whole movie is nothing but talking and I know some people may not find that enjoyable. I'm the kind of person who likes dialogue driven movies and that's why I enjoyed this movie, because of the movies excellent dialogue and I how locked in I was while watching it, but I know it's not going to be for everyone and if you think this movie is boring because it's a talky movie then that's fine.Overall Bridge of Spies isn't Spielberg's greatest movie compared to his other ones, but it is a well crafted movie with excellent performances, fantastic directing and great writing. Bridge of Spies is the best Cold War thriller I've ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Spielberg and Hanks reunion delivers once more in a solid spy movie,"After a small hiatus, Steven Spielberg returns with the untold story of James B. Donovan. An insurance lawyer who is initially chosen to defend a captured Russian spy during the peak of the Cold War. This plays out as a real lose-lose situation for Donovan, as the US justice system isn't intending to actually give the Russian spy a fair trial. Furthermore, Donovan and his family's image will be blemished as he is defending an enemy of the state. Eventually, he is even tasked to negotiate a trade between this Russian spy and a captured American spy plane pilot and a third party captive from the DDR. With all these political standpoints to consider, it is extremely difficult to juggle with these numerous perspectives in a film and not lose its direction. Luckily, Spielberg is a master at it. Long gone are the days of Spielberg blockbusters and battle epics. He now carefully chooses his projects, telling the stories he wants to in the way he sees fit. With a resume as glorious as his, it is a privilege he has more than earned. Spielberg knows the tone he wants for this movie and keeps it consistent throughout the film.The pace of the movie is rather slow, but consistent nonetheless. There is an exhilarating airplane sequence in the middle of the film, but that is where the high-stake action ends. The movie mostly keeps it tension with timely placed images and scenes that show the possible risk of nuclear war at the time.What really carries the movie is the presence of Tom Hanks. In his fourth collaboration with Spielberg, Hanks is perfectly cast as Jim Donovan who is the heart and moral compass throughout the movie. His performance brings warmth and charisma to the character, depicting him as a devoted father and lawyer. An excellently written character. Unfortunately, it's the only character to receive such treatment. The screenplay, which is written by the legendary Coen brothers, is cleverly composed as it carefully meanders its way around possible pitfalls in misunderstanding political and judicial regulations. Character depth however, seems to be lacking. Many characters Hanks interacts with are fairly shallow, serving mostly as sources of exposition to further the story. None are really memorable even though a stellar cast was available (Alan Alda, Amy Ryan etc.) This all makes Mark Rylance's performance all the more impressive, as he plays the Russian spy Rudolf Abel. He is depicted as a stoic man, a talented artist who enjoys classical music and is of loyal service to his country. At first he seems a bit odd and awkward, with no real social ties to anyone. But keep in mind that these people usually make the best spies. Mark Rylance has few dialogue to work with, but expresses himself in brilliant subtlety through facial expressions. He and Tom Hanks have nice chemistry together, as they learn to appreciate each other as honorable men who stick to their principles after being put in these unfortunate circumstances. It's a shame that he is pretty underused in this movie.Finally, a real strong point of this movie is how visually stunning it looks. Spielberg's longtime cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, takes the Cold War era and films in it a cold somber tone. He uses an autumn-like color pallet and alongside excellent lighting and near-perfect scene composition, makes every frame look like an oil painting. In addition, Bridge of Spies also contains a delightful score from Thomas Newman, which only starts 30 minutes into the movie, and has gorgeous set pieces which really transport you back to the 1950s.In summary, Bridge of Spies is a skillfully made film and a great example of how Steven Spielberg has not lost his touch in brilliantly directing movies. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance give brilliant performances, but the rather slow pace, lack of character depth in supporting actors and use of political jargon and exposition can feel a bit dull at times. Not one of Spielberg's best, but that still means it's probably going to be nominated for an Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,History

What makes up in plot is the acting that the main characters do, like Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance. They both really made the movie and the bond between them became very believable and it just made sense. The cinematography was good and I didn't expect anything different from Steven.

Bridge of Spies,"Bridge of Spies premiered at the latest New-York Film Festival, is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Tom Hanks. I loved this film but I have to admit that going to the movie I did not really know what to expect. You never know with Steven Spielberg; though it's more than likely it will always be a well directed film. However as far as Spielberg is concerned there's two types of well directed historical movie: Saving Private Ryan and Lincoln (that last one is perfectly crafted but if you've seen it once, you'll probably never watch it again). Here, the entire cast is engaging down the line. Tom Hanks is one of my favourite actor. He's genuinely one of the most likable actor in cinema history. This film is his fourth collaboration with Spielberg and once again he nails it.His performance is ultimately Oscar worthy with dry humour and reserve of intelligence that makes his character a man with very particular American ""greatest generation"" characteristics such as modesty, fundamental adherence to core principles he's been raised to value and live by. Hanks plays the movie's voice of conscience, he also can go dark but wasn't built to remain there for too long. Plus, Mark Rylance portrays a Soviet spy: Rudolf Abel with all his contemporary stages actor skills. He's very good bringing fascination and very, very subtle comic touches to a man who has made every effort to appear as bland, even invisible, as possible. Rylance really does a fantastic job, best supporting actor nomination at least.Like I said earlier, most Steven Spielberg's films are consummate entertainments that swipe you up with pure cinema. Bridge of Spies wonderfully comprehensive detailing of 1950's American life in the opening stretches, slides the viewers into the period. This is genuinely one of the best, if not the best, directed movie of the year so far. It's easy to say that because of Spielberg but I can easily see myself rewatching that film. Obviously Tom Hanks' character isn't sent to the Soviet to kill spies, but to negotiate a deal: so there's a lot of talking involved. You may be bored. But if like me you get butterflies in your body when you watch a perfectly crafted scene. When you notice that you've just seen a long wild single take of two people talking with no break, all because of Steven Spielberg brilliance: simulating a close up and mid shot. If this is your jam, you are going to enjoy this film as much as I did. Moreover, you get invested in this non-physical war. A war through words. Spielberg directed it as it was an action movie. He heats up the drama with some action, throws in crowds, chaos and transforms ordinary spaces like a home, an office or a street into battlefields. This film elevates to a new level of intrigue, tension and complexity in its last act and shapes up expertly into a John Le Carré style. Finally, this film generates an unmistakable nostalgia for a time when global conflict seemed more clear-cut and manageable than it does nowadays.Overall, Bridge of Spies is one of the best Cold-War thriller I've ever seen, a true life espionage tale smoothly handled by old pros who know what they're doing. Masterful old Hollywood style filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great spy movie,"""Bridge of Spies"" offered a solid cinematic experience that I appreciated, earning a 6/10 in my view. Its strength lay in the exceptional acting performances, with Tom Hanks delivering a compelling portrayal of a principled lawyer during the Cold War era. The film's meticulous attention to detail in recreating the period added to its authenticity, and the cinematography beautifully captured the tense atmosphere of the time. However, its weakness came from a somewhat slow and dialogue-heavy plot, which at times diluted the overall impact. While the music and visuals weren't particularly standout, they served the narrative effectively. In the end, ""Bridge of Spies"" provided an engaging historical drama with strong performances, even if it didn't quite reach the heights of Spielberg's best work.",7.0,Anonymous,History
guys on a bridge,"This movie was ok. I liked the parts that had a lot of action and tension . But I did not like it when they were in meetings or at the dinner table. The first part of the movie was good and it showed how Rudolf lives his life. Rudolf loves to paint pictures of landscapes. But he is accused of being a Russian spy. Donavan defends him even though he is an insurance attorney and hasn't done criminal defense in years. The Bridge of Spies is basically about a Russian Spy that is in The US and is caught and is traded for an American pilot. Throughout the movie, Rudolf and Donovan grow closer in their friendship and when everyone hated that he was defending him he never gave up on him. He was happy and sad that Rudolf had to go back to Russia because he knew that he was now a good friend.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Oscar Shout Out! Nothing short of Legendary and an Immediate Classic,"This film is nothing other than legendary and an immediate classic. Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are back together again, to make another incredible dramatic and genius film. With historical facts, a heartfelt and dramatic story, this film is not only bound to be an Oscar contender, but I think this film may swoop any other film this year, and win the film of the year award.This is a drama. Although it cracks jokes here and there, it really is primarily mainly a dramatic re-enactment of an historical event. The story itself is a large adventure with action and intense scenes filled with various human emotions and unpredictable actions that keep the viewer on the edge of their seat.The story starts in the middle of the Cold War, in Brooklyn. A man believed to be a Soviet Spy is arrested and, because of American law, he is supposed to get a fair trial. The man responsible for defending him in court starts noticing things and instead of just making it look like a fair trial, he actually tries to help this 'spy' get the right sort of action.I don't know how Steven Spielberg (director) does it but, he makes these stories come to life and helps you connect with the characters so that you cry, laugh and almost fall of your seat because it's so intense! The camera shots explore the scene from a variety of angles and go way beyond just showing one element. With each camera shot, you are prone to say, ""nice shot."" For example, in one scene, they are on a bridge and, instead of showing a sky high view as you might expect, he shows it from the prospective of the people. It is snowing; you can't see the other side or the people very well. You can just see a few lights and it is just so perfect. If you are a fan of Spielberg's work as I am, you will be happy to see some of his famous wide shots which help scenes seem to float into each other.As for the acting, Tom Hanks has done many roles and this is truly one of his best. He plays a character that does so many dangerous things and does them for a few people that he doesn't even know. He shows extraordinary skill portraying this character, bringing out emotions we can relate to. Full and heartfelt, with each scene his character gets better and better to the point that you are just sitting there with your eyes wide and forgetting to breathe thinking, ""What is he going to do next?"". When he is upset, you're upset. When he is terrified, you're terrified. He is perfect for this role and this is easily one of his best work.For this film, I cannot choose a favorite scene. Each scene is so important in its own way. Each scene is so spectacularly done. Each scene is so entertaining whether it's funny, intense or dramatic One of the scenes that was most impressive is when we see an American spy flying a plane, 70,000 feet over Russian territory. He is gathering intelligence and hoping to get some information about nuclear defenses. His plane is being attacked and the problem is, he was supposed to go down with the plane. The cockpit shatters and he goes into free fall. I love the scene because it looks like he is falling from 70,000 feet at an alarming rate. The execution of this is outstanding. It is clear and intense, which is why I love it so much.The subject of this film is rather mature like the scenes near East Berlin during the time the Berlin Wall was being constructed. A part of Berlin is cut off from food and everything else. There are many other scenes featuring the impact of the Cold War. Because of these, I recommend this for ages 11 to 18. I enthusiastically give it 5 out of 5 stars because this film is legendary. It is mind blowing in so many parts and, I believe it is one of the best films I have ever seen.Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",10.0,Anonymous,History

American Justice system on trial,"A good suspense Cold War movie about civilian lawyer, James B. Donovan, who negotiates the release of U2 spy plane pilot Gary Powers and American foreign exchange student Frederic Pryor for KGB mole agent Rudolf Abel. Both lawyer James B. Donovan and KGB agent Rudolf Abel had a very interesting careers in real history. It's well worth reading about them. There was also a lot of cloak and dagger/duck and cover tension drama in this movie.Should we the American people follow the typical lynch mob mentality and hang foreign agent Rudolf Abel or should we let the justice system take its course? Otherwise we would be no different than the Kangaroo courts that the Soviets would set up if they capture one of our agents. That is the question lawyer James Donovan debates about with his peers, his family, and the American public he encounters on the street before U2 pilot Gary Powers gets shot down by S.A.M.'s.This movie is Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks at their best. It will probably be an instant classic for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Mostly Okay But a Superb Finale,"Based on a true story: In 1957, James Donovan (played by Tom Hanks) is a partner in a Brooklyn law firm who deals mostly in insurance claims. After he is assigned to defend a convicted Soviet spy, his life and mission are changed entirely.Director Steven Spielberg succeeds in evoking earlier periods: Brooklyn in 1957 and Berlin in 1962. The physical atmosphere has a mood of its own in each city. These evocations are well aided by the cinematography of Janusz Kaminski.The beginning is rather good but is occasionally predictable even to those of us not aware of the historical events. Donovan also seems too earnest and we don't fully get why he would be this way considering the danger his convictions place upon him and his family.The middle of the film successfully portrays the bleakness of Berlin as the infamous wall is being built; but it tends to sag and seem overlong.The final scene, which takes place in the titular location, lifts everything to make the film worthwhile. The bleak winter night is made even harsher as the tension and suspense reach their heights. Here, Spielberg shows once again what makes him great.There may be an overall message: that countries with good laws must maintain those good laws to stay great, even when such countries are being threatened. This principle could still be a source of today's discussions about similar situations..",7.0,Anonymous,History
It reminded me of a 'Hallmark Classic' then again most of....,"...Spielberg's films do.Even allowing for the time (1957/62) difference (2014), the scenes reminded me of a 'stage set' - faux walls, sky etc.. In addition the award to Rylance wasn't warranted. His script was nearly a monotone and always let Spielberg make a bolshevik/red 'human'.The historic accuracy re. the second 'captive' 'Pryor', was false - another 'trick' by Spielberg to 'add' some human/family hook.A far better script would have added after successfully negotiating the exchange for Francis Gary Powers, Donovan's negotiated the freedom of initially 1,103 but expanded to 9,703 Cuban anti-Castro men women and children.With Spielberg, as with all Hollywood leftists, there is always the kid glove treatment of the horror of the reds, even allowing for the callous machine gunning of the fleeing East Germans over the wall. In Schindler's List, Spielberg made sure he got his anti-gun message in the final scene when the Jews are surrounded by the German SS guards and tell them (the Germans) to go. In the movie no one has firearms in reality the Jews did and had them pointed at the Germans.",5.0,Anonymous,History

"Spielberg's 'Bridge': A Believable, Entertaining Reach Across Recent History","Steven Spielberg's ""Bridge of Spies"" is great entertainment, especially for those who like their stories painted in deep dark colors, cooled by moody late-night drizzle and starring an enormously appealing and empathetic leading man (in this case, the redoubtable Tom Hanks). It's not bad as history, either. Overall, on a scale of 10, I'd give it an eight _ but advise you to read up on the facts before taking in the film.To understand the story completely, it's important to know what the United States and the Soviets were up to in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and what they were thinking.In a nutshell, it was the height of the Cold War and the so-called atomic age, a time when both nations worried about being blown out of existence, when the Soviets scored a public relations coup _ and more _ in launching the Sputnik, the first artificial Earth satellite, on Oct. 4, 1957. Now, the Americans figured, their sworn enemy could really do them damage, perhaps sending a bomb into outer space.Indeed, with this in mind, the U.S. had been sending up its super sophisticated spy plane, the U-2, having it fly over adversaries real and imagined, including the Soviet Union. One of these flights over the Soviet Union commenced on May 1, 1960, with Francis Gary Powers at the controls, and was shot down.It came at an awkward and embarrassing time for the U.S.President Eisenhower had met with Soviet leader Nikita Khruschev the previous September in America, and they were so optimistic about their talks that they planned to meet again later in 1960, this time in Moscow.Eisenhower, still worried over Soviet armaments, had nonetheless okayed the U-2 flights, even at risk of jeopardizing the upcoming talks. When the shoot down occurred, Ike at first denied the flights. But when plane debris _ and Powers himself, very much alive _ were produced, the jig was up, and Khrushchev angrily canceled the summit (perhaps something he had wanted all along anyway).On August 17, 1960, Powers was convicted of espionage against the Soviet Union and sentenced to 10 years. On February 10, 1962, he was exchanged, along with American student Frederic Pryor, in a spy swap at the Glienicke Bridge in Berlin, for Soviet KGB Colonel Vilyam Fisher, known as ""Rudolf Abel,"" who had been caught by the FBI and tried and jailed for espionage.OK, that's the story.'Bridge of Spies' focuses on the spy exchange on that bridge and how the negotiations came about, with Hanks playing New York lawyer James Donovan, who is first pressed into defending Abel (played with exquisite understated menace _ and appeal _ by Mark Rylance of ""Wolf Hall"" fame), then in fashioning a deal to have him swapped for Powers (a rather bland and somewhat miscast Austin Stowell). Thrown into the mix is American exchange student Pryor (believably if briefly played by Will Rogers), held by the East Germans, who, according to the film, are eager to establish their own independence from the Soviets while at the same time defying the Americans.The old-fashioned script (and I mean this in the best sense) _ rewritten, oddly enough, by the usually eccentric Ethan and Joel Coen, from Matt Charman's original script _ gives Spielberg the chance to do what he does best, especially when given actors like Hanks (who by the way is superb) and Rylance, which is to weave a story that engrosses and involves, which this film certainly does.The movie's spy games seem to tear a page out of Carol Reed's ""Third Man"" playbook, but instead of shadowy black and white scenes shot at askew angles in post World War II Vienna we have rainy, color-drained nights in early-1960s, newly walled Berlin. It works.If I have a problem with the film, it would probably be with the depiction of Donovan's home life, obviously intended as counterpoint to the shadowy dealings he apparently was involved in, sometimes at the exclusion of his wife and children (to make matters worse, Amy Ryan as the missus just doesn't seem like his kind of gal). I never quite buy into the family as being real, but rather as a rather heavy-handed attempt to present them as a kind of Ozzie and Harriet content with having the kids watch ""77 Sunset Strip"" as their father's clandestine life begins to enshroud them and their idyllic existence.I'm also not sure if I quite believe how Hanks' Donovan and Rylance's Abel bond into frankly inexplicable Cold War buddyism, but the technique sets up an interesting dynamic that helps flesh out the period's blurry political and nationalistic borders that often saw friends and enemies switch places at an alarming rate (just as now _ and perhaps that's the point).Powers' life, ironically, would be cut short a decade and a half later as the news helicopter he was flying over Los Angeles crashed and killed him instantly. But maybe that's yet another point, intended or not. In the kind of backstreet war _ and world _ this film depicts, the greatest threat to our existence sometimes begins at home.",8.0,Anonymous,History
7/10,"Whilst it won't be making any top Spielberg lists nor it will register as one of the year's best for me, ""Bridge of Spies"" was a very welcome time at the cinema, that proves Spielberg is still going strong.And at times you feel like he's going as strong as ever. I refer that to many little scenes that the film has, especially at the beginning with Mark Rylance. The majority of them are small chase scenes, yet Spielberg manages to stage all of them so intimately that even in the opening where you don't know who is who yet, you still feel genuine tension coming out. That is especially thanks to how to camera is placed and moved which really makes itself noticeable, but happily so because it is a pleasure to see unfold on screen.Unfortunately, Spielberg misses the mark with the overall story and emotional core for me. That is something that I see many people disagreeing on, Stuckmann for example talked about how truly what the movie is about, is two nations with different views getting along. Regretfully so I really didn't see many layers to the film, I was always engaged by the plot moving forward, but I never felt emotional about much stuff and it showed in the climax and finale that should have been the usual overwhelming of emotions from Spielberg (that for example I got from Lincoln, even though I dislike the film), but it just never arrived for me. I didn't get involved in anything other than the story and had a really hard time grasping the movie's arch, message and overall emotional punch. That is also probably due to the way many morality issues are dealt with. I get it's subjective, that there is no need to have a conclusion on the issue, but the film constantly sidelined the discussion that was going on about the moral issues involved, so much so that I found it to be murky on the subject. They are brought up throughout, but as soon as they come in they are left aside for the story to move on, so your left watching the story unfold, but I was thinking: ""can't we go back to the part where they discuss that?"".Anyways, that's enough for the lacks I found with the film. Overall I must say that as much as I didn't grasp the underlying thematic layers, I dug that story a lot. In a 140 minute movie I was never, ever bored for a second, I always wanted to see what happened next and Tom Hanks is probably on of the main reasons for it. He made every scene go out with a punch and negotiations discussions fascinating. What can I say? It was a really well written screenplay which brilliantly managed to tell a story without you ever getting confused, especially looking at how many characters there are.If you're going in expecting some Spielberg magic you will certainly be disappointed, but that's a really tall order. I think that what you get is a very good and surprisingly fun time at the cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Cold War Drama,"I just finished watching Bridge of Spies, I never saw a trailer and I knew only that it was a cold war true/story drama, I love Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg and that's all I need to know to buy a ticket. My only gripe, I wish this movie could have been longer. The atmosphere created really transports you to an era which seems so far away but only ended in (1989) twenty six years ago. There are plenty of stand out performances from a supporting cast of unknowns. Mark Rylance and Sebastian Koch really nail it and Hanks is brilliant. The movie is a fitting tribute to James Donovan who passed at the very young age of 53. I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not very realistic for my taste,"Bridge of Spies is very typical movie of Steven Spielberg. Drama set in near past history. Everything seems to be in place, well produced, authentic and it looks great. Very qualified drama indeed. Yes and no. Even everything seems to be in place, somehow the movie won't reach the right mood of cold war era. Maybe younger generation, who don't have own perspective about cold war era thinks differently, but to me the feeling is not somehow right. Everything is set almost too well and polished. Maybe it is an American perspective and it is not rough enough. Also the storytelling is too slow and almost boring. Story is solid. Acting is good, well directed and set looks authentic. But somehow there is something wrong in whole picture. Bridge of Spies is well done drama movie, even I don't agree. Very typical movie to win in Oscar's. I am sure that this is a movie that actors guild like. Bride of Spies is kind of movie which success at Oscar's is guaranteed. Well done drama even a lightly too smooth for my taste.

"Tom Hanks, a 'warhorse' like Jimmy Stewart","The role of James Donovan would have gone to Jimmy Stewart in years gone by and Hanks brings that same 'warhorse' integrity to the role: a man of modest intellect bringing more to his duties than was demanded or expected of him. Mark Rylance has a more challenging role, since Rudolph Abel is given very little back story, but as Donovan slowly warms to this cold enigmatic man, so do we, the audience. The trial scenes are inevitably slow and static, like their equivalents in LINCOLN and AMISTAD, but when events move to Germany this becomes as enthralling as anything else maestro Spielberg has brought us. Berlin in 1961 - a seamless mixture of set and CGI, presumably - is almost the real star of the movie, grim and oppressive: we see the Wall being built and some heart-wrenchingly desperate escapes.BRIDGE OF SPIES is history, with only a little jazzing-up (and some condensing of the time-line), so we know how it's going to end, but Spielberg and Hanks manage to generate terrific tension in the final scenes. This whole picture is a chilling reminder of the darkest period in East-West relations, hopefully never to be repeated.",8.0,Anonymous,History

It tells the story as it should but I appreciate the way it's told, it makes it more interesting, how the story is weaved. It makes all the difference how you spin a tale and in the same turn, hook the movie watcher in.

Spielberg's spellbinding historical journey to another hit,"When it comes to the art of storytelling on the silver screen, I believe Steven Spielberg is amongst the greatest in history of cinema! While; just like any other movie director, he is guilty of mixing truth with fiction in films marketing their movie as 'based on a true story', Spielberg tends to restrain his amount of fiction to a lot smaller percentage than other film makers do. In his historical films such as his, (1993) 'Schindler's List', and (2012) 'Lincoln', they always have a significant wealth of authentic historical awareness and themes of morality. Spielberg's just released, 'Bridge of Spies' serves as another striking example of this.The just released historical dramatic thriller takes on two big plot lines. It begins in 1957 Brooklyn where an aging mild mannered Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance) from Russia is arrested in his apartment by FBI charged as being a Russian spy. Appointed to him is, James B. Donovan (Tom Hanks) a lawyer who specializes in insurance settlements. The fact that Donovan is being placed out of his league is no mere accident. The government acting only in the interest of presenting a visual that the spy is getting his legal right to a trial, has no interest in a fair trial. Their hopes are for Rudolf to get a form of a speedy kangaroo court trial to sentence him to the death penalty. In a similar likeness to Gregory Peck's role of Atticus Finch in (1962) 'To Kill a Mockingbird', James is caught in a personal battle between his loyalty to the constitution and a world of prejudism and hate whom would rather bypass the law in the alleged best interest of America. Ironically, James soon finds himself beseeched to fly to Russia to negotiate the release of an American military spy pilot, Francis Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) who was shot down by the Russians.At the core, 'Bridge of Spies' resonates traces of themes similar to today's controversial matter of detainees at Guantanamo Bay detention camp where many incarcerated are there with no trial at all. Tom Hanks not only elegantly inhabits James's conflicted role of a man whom I suspect was highly ahead of his time in his thinking, but also must deal with what he sees as the political hypocritical world where people judge Russia for doing the exact same thing as American officials do. He places himself in a vulnerable position also where he and his family's safety may be jeopardized.What I particularly loved most of all about Spielberg's direction was what I perceived as his simplicity in tell the story. Since I don't have anything close to a high ranking IQ in the subject of political science, beforehand I had some fear that this would be one of those films where I get so flooded with political information that I become lost. That fear was quickly extinguishedSimilar to the author John Steinbeck's gift in simple writing in a fashion where everybody could understand his literature, Spielberg presented his symbolism and story in an easy to understand way. Just one example: a courtroom scene where James is desperately fighting what looks like a losing battle for him to pursue the court to follow the constitution is suddenly contrasted by a random elementary classroom scene where all the children are standing up and reciting the 'Pledge of Allegiance'. In the front stands the woman teacher glaring up at the flag with an insane smile; looking like to be a woman who has some god-like obsession with the flag.I admit; even though Steven Spielberg is my favorite movie director, I don't always love a movie he's made. However; in my opinion, I rank this as one of his great films! Will it be nominated for Academy Awards next year like the speculation and buzz that has been going around in the media? I don't know. While I don't think 'Bridge of Spies' ranks to the greatness of Spielberg's (1993) ' Schindler's List' and (1997) 'Saving Private Ryan', it nevertheless without a doubt in my opinion is highly worthy of consideration for nominations.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Would it help if I worried?,"I really wasn't expecting to enjoy this film as much as I did. Cold War, historical things don't usually float my boat that much, but the story itself was very interesting and played very well.Based on real events, essentially it is about James Donovan's (Hanks) refusal to endure injustice, as he fights for the rights of Rudolf Abel (Rylance), back in 1957.
Later we learn that Donovan is almost as much of a humanitarian as Schindler with the work he does in Cuba, but we don't see that in this film, it's just interesting to see that he wouldn't be swayed by anything. He firmly believes in the law and stands by it.Both of the lead actors give outstanding performances, as you would expect and deliver a tale that could have been quite dull or something we've seen before.
It's funny how we have seen so many films these days that we have come to expect horrible things or sudden changes of circumstance to hit right at crucial moments and then we realise that it is a bio-pic and things don't always happen like that in real life. It actually adds to the tension and makes stories new again, because it changes the current formula of movies. Sometimes even when you know how the history actually turned out, you can still find yourself expecting the hero to be shot, even though you know he grows up to become the president or something?Based on the IMDB Trivia section, very few bits were added to flesh out the story and none of them really make much difference to how it made me feel, so you are getting quite a genuine interpretation of the events as the occurred.This film actually taught me a few things I didn't know, showing up huge gaps in my historic and geographic knowledge, but if you're more clever than me (It's not hard (That's what she said)) you may not experience this. I had no idea the USSR had control over East Germany and that's what the wall was all about, but then I did fail my Mock history exam and never turned up for the real thing. I shouldn't have taken all those days off school.I can't really say what made this one so good, but it's probably a lot of things all coming together as one, the filming, lighting, direction, sets, costume, all working collectively alongside the superb acting perhaps?",7.0,Anonymous,History
A bridge too far (paytv),"The 1st thing I noticed is that even Spielberg has turned into this blue/orange grading so that's the proof that things have really turn bad! But his Kaminsky knows at least to compose with lights and for some really brief moments, I thought I was back into the X-files! Next, this movie is clearly divided into 2 parts: the one in US about the trial of the soviet spy and the other in Berlin about the exchange. The 1st one is the best as in Munich, Amistad and Lincoln, Spielberg defends justice for all and punches the security pretext! However, the 2nd part is just awful, filled with candid sugar (Hanks is also responsible) and totally unbelievable! In addition, the movie is much too long because of a lot of useless scenes (U2 mission, the detention, ). At the end, Spielberg is really far of his best: he proves one more time that he is very fragile on political movies but at least, he did them and he has found a great old actor with the soviet spy.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Spielberg vs Hanks Episode 4,"For the fourth time in they're respective careers, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have come together to make a movie. This time set during the Cold War, Tom Hanks ( James Donovan) is required to represent Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel), a Soviet Spy. But when an American spy is captured by the Soviets, it's up to Donovan to negotiate an exchange between two opposing nations. Seeing the trailers and knowing who was involved in this film, it would make one excited (if you know anything about Steven Spielberg or Tom Hanks). Bridge of Spies is a great example of historical story telling done at it's finest. Spielberg is no stranger to this feat. However this is an example of old school Hollywood, and it is not for everyone. There are two types of Spielberg history movies, the Saving Private Ryan (action packed, thrilling) and the Lincoln (great performances, talking based). Both are incredible movies for different reasons, and Bridge of Spies falls into the Lincoln category, where there isn't action, it is a film with a lot of talking. But it's those talking scenes where the movie comes to life, and a lot of that is thanks to the masterful directing of Steven Spielberg. Another big part why this movie is great are the performances. You have Tom Hanks, two time Oscar winner (Philadelphia 1993 and Forrest Gump 1994) who does amazing. What else can you expect from one of the best actors of all time. Also you have Mark Rylance (Rudolf Abel) who does, maybe just as good or even better than Hanks. Whenever he appeared on screen, he was electrifying. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a nomination for best supporting actor come the Oscars. This is definitely not Spielberg's best, and has some slight negatives. At times, felt slow and the second act was not as strong as the first or third, but still solid. Overall, Bridge of Spies is a beautifully directed film, with amazing performances, and a great history lesson. It is written by the Coen Brothers, and composed wonderfully by Thomas Newman. This movie is not for everyone, but if your the type that gets goosebumps from watching people talk in a perfectly crafted scene, then this movie is for you.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"America - the good, the bad and the ugly.","Director Steven Spielberg is the conscience of American film-makers, delving into the dark places of our history - the morally shaky ground of policymaking in a country that prides itself on its belief in upholding the principles of the U.S.Constitution. In his latest film, BRIDGE OF SPIES, he pokes a stick into the headlines of Cold War events - the 1960 U-2 Spy plane incident, in order to shed air and light into the dark reaches of official myth-making. Aware that this can be done most powerfully through precise direction, detailed sets, soaring soundtracks, and cinematography that echoes the dreary mood of the times - bright sunshine recedes behind the shadows of deception. The audience is always entertained, despite the subject matter's depiction of the murkiness of ethics and morality. Like the great illustrator Norman Rockwell - we are seduced by an ""apple pie"" ethos, except there are worms wriggling around in the crust.Tom Hanks is perfectly cast - an actor who I cannot remember ever playing a ""bad"" guy - as James Donovan, an insurance lawyer conscripted by the CIA in 1957 during the height of the Cold War hysteria to defend the arrested Soviet mole, Rudolf Abel, (an academy award winning performance by Mark Rylance,) and participate in a US government programmed ""kangaroo-court"" trial. Except James Donovan believes in the right of an individual to the best defense as the bedrock of our democracy, not willing to compromise his deeply held integrity.BRIDGE OF SPIES begins with a panning of a dreary Brooklyn street with the Manhattan Bridge in the background looming over the landscape, the camera eventually lands upstairs in a tenement building where Mark Rylance/Rudolf Abel is looking at himself in a mirror painting a quite good traditional self-portrait. This double view is our introduction to the personality of a seemingly Walter Mitty-like individual, his physiognomy imprinted with a haunting and magnetic expressiveness, conveying adversity and conviction. Rylance's sympathetic portrayal of Abel is seductive and thrilling; this spy is a mystery and remains so.Tom Hanks/James Donovan - a reincarnation of Jimmy Stewart (thicker in physique) lives a 1950's dream life in suburbia; three children and a clueless stay-at-home wife and mother (played by Amy Ryan in a thankless part.) Women are just accessories in this movie - indicative of how they were considered at the time. Thank goodness for the Feminist Movement 20 years later! Getting involved with cloak and dagger politics does not change Donovan - he is incorruptible and strongly rooted to the ideals of American values as put forth in the Constitution and Bill of Rights.At the same time as the Abel trial - America is preparing to send a U-2 spy plane equipped with surveillance equipment over Soviet territory and the Central Intelligence Agency recruits a young pilot Francis Gary Powers (a bland, handsome Austin Stowell) to complete the reconnaissance mission. In 1960, the operation is implemented and shortly thereafter the U-2 spy plane is shot down by a Soviet surface-to-air missile and Powers parachutes unto Russian soil still alive and is captured and sentenced to a long term of imprisonment and hard labor. A politically heated issue and an embarrassment for the Eisenhower administration - the incident was vigorously denied by the USA and a cover-up was attempted, but the covert military maneuver was ultimately exposed.Attempts are made to return Gary Francis Power to the USA in order to interrogate him about how much classified information he revealed to the Soviets. The authorities turn again to Attorney James Donovan to negotiate the exchange of spies on Glienicker Bridge in East Germany - Rudolf Abel for Gary Francis Powers; the tension and drama of BRIDGE OF SPIES begins against the backdrop of the Wall being erected in East Berlin - a bleak city in contrast to its counterpart in the Western sector.Pragmatic political behavior by officials in the KGB, CIA and FBI are all stick figures in the chess game of diplomacy and Tom Hanks deftly navigates his way through the labyrinth of innuendo and deceit. Espionage, duplicity, betrayal are at the heart of this film. What makes it palatable is the humanity of both Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance's characters who bond with mutual respect, despite their opposing ideological viewpoints. Director Spielberg can be sentimental, but is able to tunnel through the sappiness with humor and affection. He really likes his two leading men and so do we.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Richly Produced; For Thinking Adults,"""Bridge of Spies"" is a big-budget, beautifully produced movie that is unabashedly geared toward thinking adults. There are no nods to fanboys who need to see ""part four"" after a title or a comic book superhero in tights to commit to a film. If you go to movies for fast- paced fight scenes, explosions or strippers, stay home.""Bridge of Spies"" is an historical drama about the Cold War. It's based on real events. Insurance lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks) is pressured by colleagues to defend Russian spy Rudolph Abel (Mark Rylance), who has been caught in 1957 Brooklyn. It's his patriotic duty, they tell him, to provide the accused with counsel, even though the accused is a Russian spy at the height of the Cold War. Donovan does such a good job defending an unappealing client that he is later selected to help negotiate the release of downed U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers. No, this isn't the most scintillating of plots. Most scenes consist of men over fifty wearing suits conversing in cagey language and subdued voices about big, big issues.Lavish spending by gifted costumers, set directors and cinematographers is all over the screen. The interior of a middle- class American home in the 1950s-1960s era is beautifully recreated, right down to the divided aluminum foil trays for TV dinners. It would be hard for a male to watch this film and not feel serious fedora envy. Women may yearn for the day when a woman could single-handedly prepare a five course meal for an intact family that eats together in a formal dining room, and yet appear at that dining table looking like a Vogue cover model with cinched waist, pointy assets, firm hair and bright lipstick. And then mom, dad, and the kids hold hands and say grace, and no one looks at their cell phone, or even the TV. They all pay attention to each other.As soon as the camera moves from the United States to East Berlin, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski drains almost all color from his images, the way Dracula drained blood from his victims. The sky is dead white, without clouds or sun, and almost everything you see is the lifeless gray concrete of the Berlin Wall or the charred gray of remaining bombed out buildings. People dress in gray wool; their grim faces are the only vague smudge of color. East Berliners attempting to escape are shot by snipers in watchtowers. It's a totalitarian nightmare.When Donovan enters East Berlin to negotiate Powers' release, he enters an absurd maze of petty manipulations and espionage that would be laughable were it not so deadly. These scenes are reminiscent of the depiction of the state apparatus of petty terror in real Eastern European films like Andrzej Wajda's ""Man of Marble."" Russian actor Mikhail Gorevoy as Ivan Schischkin, a Russian negotiator, is simply a weird and scary looking and sounding man. He wonderfully channels Peter Lorre.We all know, love and trust Hanks so much that there is not as much tension in the film as there ought to be. We know he's going to do the right thing, in spite of every obstacle, temptation, threat or sneer from a stranger on a train who recognizes him from a newspaper photograph. Somehow ""A Man for All Seasons,"" as many times as I've seen it, gives me the sense that maybe, just maybe, this time Paul Scofield's Thomas More will figure out a way to compromise with Henry VIII's demands and not be decapitated. That tension that maybe Donovan will weaken or sell out or be even slightly less than utterly heroic is missing from ""Bridge of Spies."" Spielberg wanted an uncomplicated hero, and he has created one.Mark Rylance gives an amazing performance as Russian spy Rudolph Abel. Rylance is apparently a highly celebrated British stage actor but I'd never heard of him. Rylance does virtually nothing noticeable except tuck his chin into his neck and elevate his eyebrows, yet he is riveting, moving, and memorable. Now that's acting!Abel was just one of the spy's many aliases. His real name was Vilyam ""Willie"" Genrikhovich Fisher. He was of German-Jewish ancestry. Did that play any role in his dedication to Communism? He had lived during the Holocaust. Did Communism offer the only brighter tomorrow in which he could believe? It would have made his life so much better if he had defected to the West, rather than go to prison. Why did he not? The film offers no clue.""Bridge of Spies"" recreates for the viewer the undercurrent of daily fear during the Cold War. Schoolchildren cry during a school ""duck and cover"" presentation. A boy fills his bathtub with water so as to be prepared for nuclear attack. What was missing for me was what each side offered: an articulation of capitalism v communism. Perhaps the film could have included scenes where Donovan and Abel present their respective systems, their promises and flaws. There are reasons the Berlin Wall went up in 1961, and came down in 1989, reasons that seem to elude the supporters of US presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.As it is, there is a marvelous scene where Donovan tells Hoffman, a CIA agent who looks a bit like Bobby Fischer (another pawn in the Cold War) what makes an American an American – the Constitution.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Steven Spielberg always makes the audience keep on the edge of their seats.

As usual Tom Hanks gives another well acted performance just like in any other movies of him. Another actor that give great performance was Mark Rylance. I never heard of him only in this film and i am blown away with his portrayal of Rudolf Abel, his facial expression is great the acting of him really from the heart.The movies is more on drama but it's thrilling.

Other than that is a great movie and very entertaining for a two hour feature with people talking all the time, it may seem like a boring political movie, but in fact has a nice pace (slow at times) with some light jokes to ease the mood, and Mr Hanks never disappointing what he has to show his acting skills, just don't expect many spies in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Solid Drama, Slow Burn","Bridge of Spies is a well-crafted historical drama that showcases Steven Spielberg's storytelling prowess and a solid performance from Tom Hanks. The film effectively captures the tension of Cold War-era negotiations, with Hanks delivering a nuanced portrayal of a lawyer navigating high-stakes diplomacy. The cinematography and period details add authenticity, immersing you in the era.However, the film does have its drawbacks. The pacing can feel deliberate, and at times, the slow buildup might test your patience. While the methodical approach serves to build tension, it occasionally results in a sluggish narrative that could feel dragging for some viewers.Overall, Bridge of Spies is a compelling drama with strong performances and meticulous attention to detail. It might not be the most fast-paced film, but it's a thoughtful and engaging portrayal of a fascinating historical event. If you appreciate well-executed historical narratives and can endure a slower pace, this film is worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Fine Addition to the Collection,"The term espionage drama often injects doubt in one's mind these days. Primarily because one imagines a repetitive enactment of a browbeaten story line spiced up with a wiser than thou twist that leaves the unimaginative audience spellbound, but the seasoned viewer dismayed. Bridge of Spies is perhaps one of the better spy thrillers to have been produced in the last 2-3 years.What differentiates the movie is the sincerity of the plot. Despite a cold-war era plot and seemingly predictable themes, Spielberg manages to enthuse the audience with unpretentious storytelling.There is an air of suspense that lingers on till the end, but never commands or steers the plot. In fact the best part of the movie is that it excavates human emotions and psychology through the various sequences , thereby catapulting the drama to an equal status of that of the thriller.Tom Hanks does a great job with the character dealt to him. Also noteworthy is the performance of the main CIA lead . The movie may be accused of being a little too sentimental and tad melodramatic , but then in this age of serving uncooked and practical relationships, I would love to go have a extra helping of emotions , once in a while.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Docudrama depicting the historical exchange between a US U2 pilot with a Soviet spy.,"Spielberg's depiction of the Cold War is quite interesting because it allows of greater understanding as to the depth of the animosity between the United States and the Soviet Union at that time. However, I believe that the logistics of the exchange were oversimplified, and did not pose to be an accurate depiction of the heated arguments that must have been at play during that time. In addition, certain imagery was very effective in drawing comparative environments between the United States and the Soviet Union, such as the scene in Berlin when James Donovan is viewing the men that attempted to climb over the Berlin wall. This scene was compared to the end scene in which we were exposed to children in the United States climbing over a fence without the slightest nervousness of violence. Overall, this movie was a great docudrama that inspired to support the strength and conviction of the United States' pride in a free trial.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Very sub-par,"The acting was average. However, in all fairness the movie didn't have any challenging parts either, There wasn't any suspense, it wasn't an intelligent movie and the desired goal of all parties was extremely insignificant. The character development was also poor. I'm not sure why this movie was even made. It basically just went through the motions, like Hanks's prior movie when he was a boat captain. I truly prefer his earlier movies where he showed charisma and / or the movies were much more substantial. Obviously I'm in the minority as the movie received good reviews and did well in the box office; however, i do believe the points I make are accurate,",4.0,Anonymous,History
"Thoughtful, possible allegory of man versus government","I am not a Spielberg fan. I don't dislike his films but they are not essential viewing. However Bridge of Spies is different. I am sure others will comment that he has made similar films. I may not have seen them.Here's a few thoughts. Interesting to note that Spielberg's father had been involved in US - Soviet negotiations at the the same time as the film is set.Although the character points out that the US government is a sham and a fraud in their trial of Abel, no search warrant etc Tom Hanks does not appear too outraged.Did the financial backers of this movie also insist that an American out negotiates the Soviet and East German governments? Or did that actually happen?Are there any parallels int his film with the moral vacuum we see in the US's attitude to the Middle East and Islam? Was that an intention? I feel certain that the Cohen Brothers and Spielberg definitely do not believe that everything is shiny under the bonnet of the US.To the film itself. As I left the cinema I heard several people say ""best film I've seen all year. I wanted to find out why they thought that. Because aside from a few scenes of graphic threat and danger I was struggling to work out how you'd sell this film as one of the best films all year.Personally I loved it. Occasionally the story telling was a little trite but it was a grown up film for grown ups...telling us a story of man v governments in a cynical way. It's just a shame that so many Americans still think the US is honourable. Let's hope Bernie Sanders leads them from late next year for 4- 8 years. Thankfully in this film, man seems to win but it a closer thing. Of course the East Germans are trying to outdo the Soviets. Of course the soviets don't believe anything they are told. Of course the American CIA are small minded and ridiculous and cannot see that their imperialism is as authoritarian as the Soviets....but the audience get to side with a human being not an ideology.Great film.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Bridge of Spies--Channeling the Cold War,"The second collaboration between Steven Spielberg and Joel and Ethan Coen, who co- wrote the script with Matt Charman, ""Bridge of Spies"" lands a place in my ""Top 10 Films of 2015"" list.In this historical drama, ""Bridge of Spies"" takes place during the heat of the Cold War— 1957--Tom Hanks stars as the American attorney, James Donovan, who is asked to defend Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (the formidable Mark Rylance) and later to negotiate the exchange of the downed US pilot Gary Powers for Abel.The story is ripped from the headlines of fifty-nine years ago, Donovan, despite massive public disapproval, CIA obfuscation, and threats against his family, refuses to ignore Abel's constitutional rights for a fair trial. Donovan's wife, Mary (Amy Ryan) meets eyes with her embattled husband and, in that look, Donovan understands the high stakes in taking the moral position to which he tenaciously holds on.

A Solid Bridge,"'Bridge of Spies' is a solid retelling of the Gary Powers incident, where a U.S. pilot was shot down over the Soviet Union while conducting reconnaisance at the height of the cold war. Powers was ultimately repatriated in a prisoner exchange, and the film is told from the perspective of the civilian lawyer who negotiated the deal. Tom Hanks plays the lead as an All-American, squared-jawed liberal lion, but the film is nicely nuanced, with just one moment of corn (where Hanks happens to see some wannabe escapees from East Berlin shot in the act). Spileberg directs and the Cohen brothers wrote the script, so the film's basic competenace is hardly surprising; but it's nicely nuanced story with a Le Carre-esque mood, with just one moment of corn (where Hanks happens to see some wannabe escapees from East Berlin shot in the act).

Confronting History Through a Cold War Tale,"This weekend, I finally got around to watching ""Bridge of Spies,"" a film I've been meaning to see for a while. Directed by Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks, this movie is essentially a lesson in the Cold War era, but taught not by a tedious history teacher, but by one of Hollywood's finest storytellers.The film is inspired by a true story: Tom Hanks plays James Donovan, a lawyer who is tasked with defending Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), accused of spying for the Soviet Union. Donovan wrestles with the pressure from the American public and his own internal conflicts about what justice really means. His story is genuinely captivating.What struck me most about the film was the depth of the relationships between characters. Especially the respect-based relationship that develops between Donovan and Abel, despite being supposed enemies, elevates the film from an ordinary spy story to a masterpiece that celebrates the victory of human values over political interests.Visually, the film does an excellent job of capturing the atmosphere of the Cold War in the '60s. The construction of the Berlin Wall, the tension between East and West Berlin, are all brought to our screens. However, Spielberg's ability to push these historical events into the background and bring forward the stories of individuals is the film's strongest point.The music and performances are top-notch as well. The chemistry between Hanks and Rylance creates an impact that transcends the screen. However, the pacing drops in some parts, slightly disrupting the narrative flow. This is perhaps why my rating is 9/10.In conclusion, ""Bridge of Spies"" is a must-watch for anyone interested in the Cold War period. Spielberg's direction, the outstanding performances of Hanks and Rylance, and the compelling story all combine to offer a human-centered perspective on historical events. I definitely recommend it, though I might have wished for a bit of a quicker pace next time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Philadelphia meets Schindler's List,"Personally I thought the movie was a bit too heavy-handed and that the ending was way more melodramatic than it should have been. But the movie was good. More than that, it is a story that must be shown today. I felt the ending kind of ruined the effect a little bit, though.The story is that of a lawyer who believes in the law - imagine that - and because of his extraordinary efforts to defend a Russian spy in the heavily patriotic legal system from 1957 he is tagged to intermediate a prisoner exchange. You get this idea directly from the trailer and the plot, as it were, is not deviating from that. Instead, it is Hanks' acting and Spielberg's directing that you need to appreciate, as they masterfully make the case for the spirit of America, not for its power.The film is based on a real person, and his own autobiographical book, and it is well rendered, albeit a bit paint-by-numbers. The title of my review is more accurate than I would have wanted. Even so, I felt that the first part of the movie was great and that it should have been a film on its own. You get a man that is doing his job and upholding the moral values Americans are so proud of by defending a man that everyone thinks is despicably guilty and as reward gets scoffed at, gets the evil eye and even has shots fired at his house - 2nd amendment style - from a driving by car, only to be blamed for it by the police officers called to investigate. He returns to his job only to find that cases he was assigned to were reassigned and his partners are reluctant to speak to him.That message is far more relevant today than the general result driven heroics that movies - including this one - usually portray. The point is that good means different things for different people and therefore it never actually wins. The fact that Donovan had a successful career as a negotiator later on is good for Donovan, but I felt it hurt the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History

impeccable representation of THAT America,"A Cold War thriller starring a Tom Hanks seeming inexplicable. Steven Spielberg's technique is to pack intrigue and movement into every shot, to fill his characters and story with fidelity to the era's realpolitik. It's a movie without much glamor and it's enjoyable though there's no impetus or pace. Spielberg can't animate a Coen brothers script combining espionage and court room. 141 minutes is an excessive runtime but the story successfully bets the house on the interplay between an all-American archetype and a reserved but fragile traitor looking like a bank clerk.

"An Intense, Powerful, Captivating Spy Thriller","24 October 2015. Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance star in this amazing, intense, and compelling movie about the behind the scenes negotiations between James Donovan, a United States lawyer, and the U.S.S.R. and East Germany for the exchange of Rudolph Abel, a convicted Russian spy and Gary Powers, whose American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Russia in 1961. This mainstream movie directed by Steven Spielberg brings great cinematography, setting, and performances to build the tension, suspense through acting and script especially without action and fireworks. This is truly a big screen, big tent-pole event movie based on historic events as well as the poignant fear and importance of the human spirit in the face of a frightening, uncertain foreign world.There is a pungent feeling of both dread and hope in this dark mysterious world of espionage. Bridge of Spies carries its weight of deeper psychological warfare reminiscent of John LeCarre's classic Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy (1979) or Breach (1997) and with setting a similar tone and flavor of The American (2010) or Sum of All Fears (2002) as well as a same period spy movie The Spy Who Came In From the Cold (1965) or The Russia House (1990) presenting a smaller scale, or the more broader sweep found in The Good Shepard (2006), all possessing a powerful espionage theme. This movie is riveting, capturing the visceral emotive uncertainty and fear, sometimes powerlessness, and sometimes faithful confidence that arises from an understanding the serious game being played. In addition there are some nicely timed and edited subtle humor to balance the drama occurring on screen. Overall, this is one of the best movies of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Solid historical drama,"Bridge of Spies tells the story of lawyer James B Donovan's defense of a Russian spy and subsequent role as a negotiator in the trade of that spy for U.S. pilot Gary Powers.It didn't strike me as that intriguing a story, honestly, but I like director Stephen Spielberg so I thought I'd take a look.The result is surprisingly engaging. The story is simple but interesting, the movie deftly sketches out cold war tensions, and there are solid doses of humor and drama.While I often find Tom Hanks a little too noble, he nicely underplays Donovan, who comes across not, like a lot of Hanks' roles, as a man so noble that he is on the verge of tears at his own nobility, but rather a smart lawyer with a great deal of integrity. There are no speeches, no tearful moments, but you wind up really admiring the guy.Even better is Mark Rylance as the Russian spy, an odd, phlegmatic little guy with his own kind of integrity.While the movie is entertaining and absorbing, it is a movie that, like Spielberg's Lincoln, feels a little too careful and educational to really bring history to life the way a movie like Spotlight does. Spielberg seems to have lost interest in taking chances (I really think he should break out of his mold and make a Dogme 95-style film), and that can make his films seem a touch stodgy, but he still has that remarkable directorial expertise, and certainly knows how to make a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Spielberg once again is building strong cinematic bridges!,"Master auteur Steven Spielberg's latest movie ""Bridge of Spies"" is not falling down, not falling down, not falling down. OK, I think my Bridge of Puns is nearly extinguishing you from further reading. But please continue to read for puns' sake. This 1950's true story film adaptation stars the splendiferous Tom Hanks as insurance lawyer James Donovan who inexplicably is delegated to defend arraigned Russian spy Rudolf Abel, exceptionally & subtlety played by Mark Rylance. Donovan is conflicted on defending a Russian spy and all the negative publicity it will receive; and not to mention how it will affect his family. Spielberg once again puts on the genius directorial cap with his intelligent direction of a Steven flick; and there are no bridge of lies with that statement. Another truth you have to handle is that Tom Hanks keeps on putting up strong work; he captivates with his starring performance as Donovan. But it is Rylance here who is the master thespian of the movie, and you can rely on that. Would you want me to add more on the movie? Would it help? But a few tidbits I will add: loved Thomas Newman's score of the picture and the solid screenplay from Joel & Ethan Coen and Matt Charman. That's all I have to say about this movie. In other words, I would rather not be a spoiler spy and let you cross the rest of the ""Bridge of Spies"". ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,History
Spielberg delivers another incredible dialogue driven film,"'Bridge of Spies'.. A Drama/Spy Thriller Biopic.. Directed by Steven Spielberg.. Written by the Coen Brothers.. Starring Tom Hanks.. Seriously, this film deserves WAY more love and attention than it got. This film told the story of James Donovan, a lawyer who defended a captured Soviet spy and was then thrown into the middle of the Cold War where he was responsible for organising an exchange: a captured US pilot for a Soviet spy. This was an incredible movie all across the board, Spielberg as usual has done a fantastic job at directing this film and Tom Hanks puts in one of the performances of his career (It seems as though everything he does is 'one of the performances of his career') as they tell this story in the most captivating way possible. One thing you must know about this film and the thing i loved the most about it is that this is, from start to finish, is a dialogue driven film with fantastic visuals to make you feel like you are in East Berlin. You don't get any high stakes action scenes, and no fast paced violent depictions of the Cold War, this is a very focused story about one man and his mission to organise a trade between two opposing governments.And at first it may seem rather boring, you may ask; How are they going to fill 2 hours and 20 minutes with conversations and discussions about a trade for two men in a 'Spy Thriller'? Well by utilising amazing and incredible dialogue, they manage to capture your attention at every moment and you are fully engaged the whole time so that the film goes by really quickly. I cannot express enough, how amazing the dialogue is to be able to carry the film all the way through without needing any big exciting events. The dialogue is so smart that you start picking up on the little hints that tie in to things said an hour prior and start noticing moments of foreshadowing and it only goes to show the amount of attention and thought from the Coen Brothers that went into crafting the dialogue in the film. There are a few scenes in the film where Spielberg creates the feeling of tension extremely well without using any dialogue or little music, just visuals. These relatively quiet moments were so powerful and managed to get the message across without any exposition, that it is another testament to Spielberg's incredibly diverse directing abilities.Tom Hanks was just absolutely amazing in this film as James Donovan. This film showed why he remains as one of my favourite actors of all time. Especially in these dramatic roles, the way he embodies the character and their traits and personality, you never feel like he is just playing the same character over and over. The dialogue alone isn't enough to captivate an audience, you need a top tier actor to put in a stellar performance and make it all seem believable, imagine Adam Sandler delivering the same lines, it simply would not work, and would just turn into a shitty comedy. Tom Hanks it seems can be anyone, need a Captain Phillips? Walt Disney? James Donovan? Hanks is your go-to guy. If i was to pick out anything i think could have been done better i would be nit-picking because it is a variation of minor stuff. But there is a brief moment around a third of the way into the film where there is a shift in the overall focus of the film and i thought it happened a little too quick and would liked to have seen it drawn out a little, but seriously, just a fairly minor thing.So in the end, this is a film you should definitely check out, a Dramatic, Suspenseful Spy Thriller that takes out the big action set-pieces and replaces them with interesting and captivating dialogue delivered by Tom Hanks to perfection.8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Nice,"Bridge of spies was a nice movie. The lawyer put his life at risk to stand for his American beliefs. Whether he was a spy or not was pretty crazy as you never find out if Able was a spy or if Powers actually told them. Also the lawyer standing up for Able was a great example of this. The people turned their backs on him but he never turned his back. The movie as a whole was interesting, always making you want to watch and see what happens next. Movies don't usually do that as there's almost always a boring moment, but the build up was so good and juicy that I don't believe there was a dull moment. This was a very interesting take of the real events and made the story pretty wild.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Tom Hanks at his usual best,"Loved this film for its history (I was a teenager during the early stages of the Cold War and remember well the feeling in America during the early 60's). I so enjoy a historical/legal drama and this movie certainly satisfies in that arena. Tom Hanks is brilliant as the attorney who becomes progressively enmeshed in nail biting, high level spy trading negotiations. Mark Rylance as the Russian spy gave a memorable performance for which he deserved an Oscar. One felt such pathos surrounding this spy who in the end, whether he was convicted in America or sent back to his homeland in a spy trade, was in a no win situation. For the attorney played by Tom Hanks, he apparently became quite an asset in negotiating international deals for the Kennedy administration.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Makes You Proud to be an American,"Hanks just chooses the best or he is the best, not sure. This film inspires. I mean you feel for the bad guy by the end of it. Hanks makes it innately human and American. He somehow always instills a sense of pride with his films where he plays a character like this. Honestly, I enjoyed the settings and costumery quite a bit. They really did a great job placing us in the time. I liked the scenes around the wall. It makes me wonder if that is how it was, just walk across the area as they built it. I have been to the museum at Brandenburger Tor. I didn't get some of the things shown in this film from that visit. Though a lot was shown.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Cold War Drama,"Tom Hanks was perfect for this role as a sort of avuncular action hero whose superpower is decency and common sense. The Soviet spy was portrayed as a highly honorable man who believed in his cause and was willing to die for it. Powers, on the other hand, was a pawn in the American intelligence apparatus without the proper training to fend off even the mildest sort of interrogation. U. S. Aircrews have been receiving much better training since.I have to say that I'm not a huge Spielberg fan (please don't tell him that, I don't want to hurt his feelings), but he took what could have been a really dry and boring page of history and turned it into a fine movie.Almost 60 years later in 2021, we still have our Russia problem. We can only hope the our new President, Joe Biden, will play the role of Tom Hanks and deal with the Russian oligarch Vladimir Putin with the same sort of no nonsense determination. Trump wanted Putin to be his friend. Putin is not our friend.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A real good movie.,"Great to see such a good film, Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance are superb and the whole film moves at a good pace. I had began to wonder if there were many good films out there , as there seems to be a lot of A list actors in B/C list movies. This is not one of those, it a great story , well acted, well directed, and well worth watching. Reminds me that when the US makes a good film, nobody can come close to them. Mark Rylance has a face and an air about him that makes you believe that he's the real soviet spy, with an interesting Scottish accent and an occasional slip into his soviet past. Tom Hanks puts in another seasoned great performance as James Donovan, and one of the best lines is when Donovan/Hanks asks Abel/Rylance , Aren't you worried ? to which he replies Would it help ? All superb stuff, do yourself a favor and see this film, it will not disappoint you.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A very pro-American film,"The Donovan character (Tom Hanks) was portrayed as being perfect. A good husband, a good father, a good lawyer, a good humanitarian. While he did lose the first spy case, in the end, he saved his client's life and even got him out of prison. Is there nothing he couldn't do? Pro-American means also anti-communist.East Berlin. My parents were born in Berlin and my father took me there about 4-5 years after the film takes place. Both my parents lived in what was in the 1960s the Eastern (Russian) zone.It was no problem to cross the border into East Berlin. I did not see as much war destruction as was shown in the film. In fact, other then some bullet and shell damage to buildings, I can only remember one that showed real damage, and it was only the top two floors of a building. The scene with the gang that steals Hanks coat is pure fiction. East Berlin had both local policemen and Russian soldiers armed with machine guns. There may well have been young men without jobs, but they would not have been permitted to hang around in a group and harass people walking by.I never saw people being shot down for trying to escape from the east, but I doubt very much the soldiers were even armed with machine guns, much less used them.The film makes East Berlin look like a hell compared to the US. That is a pretty big exaggeration. The people in East Berlin did not have access to the rich stores and latest goods in West Berlin, but that is not my idea of hell.It's a simplistic way of looking at the world: we are good/perfect/rich and they are jealous of us.I did not particularly enjoy the film even within its own context.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Bridge of Spies"" is a superb movie. Not only based on a very true events in a kinda complicated times and situations, it highly entertainingly and clearly tells and shows this story - leave it to Steven Spielberg to make an entertaining movie about not very entertaining things. I won't go into the details but the plot is very involving and the movie itself is very absorbing, with no good / bad sides - it kinda even inspirational one.About the acting - all involved were very good, but there is one exception. Mark Rylance. THIS is the very best acting i saw in a 2015 movie so far. Give my all movie about his Rudolf Abel - i couldn't take my eyes off him - EVERY scene he is in he steals it. His face expression, eyes, talk, the way he smokes and everything - this is the Best Supporting Acting from 2015 - sorry Stallone, as much i enjoyed ""Creed"" and your acting - Mark Rylance more deserves an Oscar in upcoming awards - ""stoykij muzyk!""Overall, ""Bridge of Spies"" is very good movie on all accounts. It is a bit maybe to Hollywodical"" here and there, but this is a highly involving movie and superbly crafted movie which takes place in seemingly forgotten time. Filled with very good performances and one exceptional, this is an excellent movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"'It is a bloody good story' (quoted by Spielberg), but alas not told from the much more urgent present times","I gave this movie an 8 for how it showed simply a good cold war thriller. It had the cold war tension between the US and USSR, played out in the divided Berlin, both East and West. Beautifully filmed as a British costume drama, I also liked how Tom Hanks's character provided some inner tension in how his look on justice for all, even for spies, had consequences for both himself as his family. What is surprising though is that Spielberg confirmed in a BBC interview he had no political message in this one. That is curious to say the least, with all the abundant contemporary parallels like Snowden for Abel in the story, or drones for the U2 back then. His reply was 'it is just a bloody good story'. Sure, but a story that makes America look good, in 2015, a time when he could have made a political thriller that could have given us a much more balanced view of reality we see today, with the US spying on everyone. The result would then have been much more powerful and less preachy. His choice is all the more peculiar, since he did not shy away showing us uncompromising battle scenes in Saving Private Ryan, but perhaps it was also helping us realize that was indeed a deserved accolade for what America has done for the world. Spielberg is, as IMDb says, indeed one of the most influential figures of cinema, and he deserves this for his many film making qualities as also this movie shows us again. I just wish with aging he would also have the guts to be like Shakespeare, to allow the arguable greatness of the US to shine through all the flaws it surely has like any country. But, to stick with Spielberg, if you just go for the story alone, and you don't mind the propaganda of the US being the ultimate example of the Good of the Free World, then this beautifully adapted film is entertaining enough.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Definitely a lackluster film,"This movie made me go night-night really fast and Mr Hanks looks like he needed to go poo-poo really bad......The movie overall was incredibly lackluster and slowly paced. He over-embellished an insurance lawyer.I fell asleep within 20 min due to monotonous speaking and every time i woke up it was the same thing. Best sleeping aid I've ever found! It guarantees a good nights sleep. I usually complain about my boyfriend falling asleep during movies, but i took a really great 2 hour long nap.Also, most of the time Tom Hanks' character looks as though he's extremely constipated. I feel his facial expressions were a little overly emphasized and it became distracting.Overall, if you're a history buff with an iron clad ability to stay awake through even the most boring situations, you'll enjoy this.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Twizard Rating: 100,"What's Spielberg without war? He continues pushing out film after film involving some war story and somehow we can never get tired of it. We never feel like he's beating a dead horse. It's because the man encapsulates the classic ideals of cinema, and one of the last of his kind to do so.Spielberg's way of directing is the kind that invites you to come aboard, but never forces you to. He doesn't beg for your attention--you just can't help but give it to him--sometimes without even realizing.Bridge of Spies is a story about espionage, human rights, societal opinion, understanding your enemy, and American pride all wrapped up into one. It's at its very best when themes conflict and contradict with one another--which happens all throughout.Taking place in New York in the 1950s during the Cold War, it stars Tom Hanks as James B. Donovan, an insurance lawyer chosen to represent captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Obviously, Donovan becomes one of America's most hated men, meanwhile developing a friendship with Abel and truly understanding his life and choices. Then tables are turned as now the Soviets have captured one of our own spies and Donovan must use Abel as leverage to trade back what is ours.Bridge of Spies constantly reminds us that at our worst we are still better than the Soviet Union. It acts as a good reminder of our humanity, even during the times that are most bereft of it. Perhaps it even satirizes our willingness to change our minds. While our viewpoints may be skewed at times by the media or even the government, it reminds us that we never quite know the whole story--although we're wholly convinced that we do at times.The first third takes place in America--presumably on purpose. It's a little darker than many other period pieces may depict it as--say even this year's The Man from U.N.C.L.E.--obviously a very specific perspective of the era. Then the last chunk of the film features the most depraved East Berlin. But the thing is, here we don't see it as any exaggeration. It's exactly how we've always envisioned it during that time. That's how it was--glum and depressing--another reminder.Spielberg uses juxtaposition to its finest potential, transitioning between scenes of Americans and Soviets--an American spy going to sleep in his cell after being tortured by Soviet soldiers cuts to Abel, the most hated man in America, being woken up respectfully by American prison guards.I will say, however, that there is something missing with the absence of a John Williams score in the film, but Thomas Newman's style fits nicely with the project adding the right amounts of emotion.The film adequately captures the misinformed fears of the early Cold War and uses them to get its points across. It's last reminder, and perhaps its strongest, is that you never know the whole story. When you stop thinking independently you begin allowing others to control you--much like the Soviets tried doing. It's crazy. Our fear was inadvertently becoming what it so desperately tried to avoid.How can you not love Spielberg? He brings magic back into the movies when we feel, at times, it may be gone forever. Bridge of Spies is superb--one of the year's best. This is why I go to the movies.Twizard Rating: 100",10.0,Anonymous,History
A good historical and dramatic film,"In 1957 James B. Donovan ,an insurance lawyer, becomes the defense counsel of Rudolf Abel.Donovan is a very intelligent man: he is convinced that Rudolf Abel alive might be more useful for a future prisoner exchange that condemned to death.So he manages to to spare Rudolf Abel the death penalty.The climate was very tense in the United States and Donovan was attacked in the newspaper for saving the life of Abel.Some days later, Gary Powers, an U-2 pilot is captured in the Soviet Union.The CIA convinced Donovan to organize a exchange of spies and sent secretly Donovan to Berlin (for his family he was working in London).Donovan hears about a U.S. student Frederic Pryor who has been arrested in East-Berlin and against the opinions of the CIA and U.S. government he is insisting in exchange Abel againt Powers and Pryor.
Donovan was an ecellent negociator, he had this intelligence and tenacity for convincing Russian and East-German for the exchange.

Bridge of Communication of a Complex Issue,"I love how Spielberg is able to tell such a complex historical event in such a humane way. Having the Cohen brothers as accomplices I'm sure solidified the success of this movie which easily could have faded into the piles of forgotten spy/Cold War predecessors.Barring the language at times, this would be such a great film for older students to watch, study, and hopefully inspire. There are so many great lessons to be learned about character, standing for what is right regardless of the disdain of others, and most of all courage of players in the world who each in their own country or manner believe in what they are doing is right.Appreciated also is the that Donavan did not discard one single human life at stake in the exchange, regardless of the government's disdain for his choice! I mean, WOW!Ass Donavan (Hanks) summarizes, each person is acting as a soldier in their respective vocations. While we often and rightly react negatively and succinctly towards spies against our country, we also are doing the same in other countries of the world.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An Uninspired Film By An Unmanageable Director That Drags On And On...,"Can Spielberg make a movie that's less than 2 hours anymore? Seriously... WAY TOO LONG!!! And, why, you might ask? Well, because of all of the bad puns and jokes that have no place in a movie like this. Also, because of all of the dead air and space that Spielberg left in the movie for 'effect' (like a clock ticking for 20 seconds to illustrate that Tom Hanks was bored... Thanks.) Oh, and it was also long from all of the interludes filled with terrible orchestral music. Music can make a film, and there were times where the music was as bad as the jokes. No one wants to tell the Legendary Spielberg and Iconic Hanks that less is more, so we are left with a movie that will be forgotten by the next decade.One bright spot - the scene where Gary Powers' plane gets shot down is brilliant (not a spoiler - it was in your history textbook in 9th grade).
