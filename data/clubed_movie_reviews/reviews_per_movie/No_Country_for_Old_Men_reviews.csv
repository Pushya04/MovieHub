Welcome to NihilismLand,"No Country for Old Men won four Academy Awards in 2007, including Best Picture and Best Director(s). Despite the critical acclaim, the Coen Brother's adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel was probably a bit of a head-scratcher to many people.The film's narrative begins in familiar fashion, introducing you to the main characters and setting up the plot using recognized, established filmic devices. Llewelyn Moss stumbles upon a suitcase filled with cash and wants to keep it for himself. Anton Chigurh is the sociopath who will stop at nothing to get the cash back. Ed Bell is the Sheriff tasked with bringing Chigurh to justice and, it is presumed, keeping Moss and his wife, Carla Jean, from danger. In addition, there's a corporate backer, a hired gun, and a Mexican gang who are also after the cash (i.e., the McGuffin). So much for the usual narrative elements.When the film continues far beyond the point that the expected narrative structure breaks down, viewers are left to grasp at what the film is actually about. What, if anything, is this film trying to say?I propose that the film is, among other things, a meditation on the impotence of human and divine systems of justice in light of unflinching, unrelenting, random, radical evil. There are a number of elements in the film that indicate such a meditation, but one need not look much further than the meditations of Sheriff Bell, whose words begin and end the film. Consider:""There was this boy I sent to the 'lectric chair at Huntsville Hill here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killt a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. Said he knew he was going to hell. 'Be there in about fifteen minutes'. I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure.""With these words, the film's ""story line"" unfolds, with Sheriff Bell trying, and failing, to be effective.At the end of the film, the retired Sheriff Bell describes a dream to his wife:""It was like {my father and I} was both back in older times and I was on horseback going' through the mountains of a night. Going' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and there was snow on the ground and he rode past me and kept on going'. Never said nothing' going' by. He just rode on past... and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. 'Bout the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was going' on ahead and he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. And then I woke up.""The film is nihilistic in both structure and content. If you would like to force a less despairing ending, Bell's dream could be interpreted as a ray of hope: a light shines in the darkness! On the other hand, it is a dream that he wakes up from.I don't know what to make of that. I sure don't. But that doesn't mean I can't try.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What's the most money you ever lost on a coin toss?,"Opinions do look to be sharply divided on this typically interesting effort for the Coen brothers. Some hail it a masterpiece, others don't see the appeal at all. While this viewer doesn't quite fit into the former camp, he will say that it's one of the more unconventional examples of crime fiction that one is likely to see. It's much more of a character piece than anything, with some grisly scenes of violence here and there. Based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy, it centres around three characters, one being a poor hunter named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who one day stumbles into the aftermath of some drug deal gone horribly wrong. He finds $2 million on the scene and impulsively decides to keep the money for himself, while a mysterious, creepy, sadistic stranger named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) tracks him down, porting a unique pressurized air weapon. Somewhat involved is a weary Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who's unsettled by what he sees as the changing times. Now, granted, what's going to test the patience of some of the viewers are some of the monologues; this isn't for people who want a straightforward story and who are turned off by philosophical musings. One can hardly fail to notice how low key most of this narrative is; even in the more intense scenes there's never really a sense of urgency. On the plus side, what we do get are some excellent character moments from the solid star trio of Brolin, Bardem, and Jones. The supporting cast is equally impressive - Woody Harrelson, Kelly Macdonald, Garret Dillahunt, Tess Harper, Barry Corbin, Stephen Root, and Beth Grant. The Coens work with some of their reliable prior collaborators such as composer Carter Burwell and cinematographer Roger Deakins. All things considered, ""No Country for Old Men"" may not be to all tastes, and does require some patience on the part of the viewer. It also doesn't resolve itself in the way one might expect for this genre, and might prove to be less than satisfactory in this regard for some of those watching. There's one fantastic confrontation near the end, but the film closes, curiously enough, after a monologue by Bell about a dream he's had. How much or how little all of this works will be up to the individual viewer. In any event, the actors are all fantastic, especially Bardem, and they make the journey worthwhile.

Some Interesting Characters,"While on a hunting trip, a sportsman (Josh Brolin) finds dead men and a stash of cash in the remote back country of West Texas, the result of a drug deal gone wrong. The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.To some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. ""No Country For Old Men"" is really his story. He doesn't know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it's something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.The film's premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there's lots of silence.Overall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh's requests in a characteristic Texas twang.The film's color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It's a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.""No Country For Old Men"" is a fine film. I'd describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fear the Reaper...,"An opportunity presents to get rich quick, a stash of cash made up of bills thick as a brick, but your conscience sets a trail, for a reaper to assail, a real psycho, has a vessel with a kick.

A haunting thriller with poetic Texas grit,"Rural Texas can be hard on anyone, even a rugged and tough Sheriff with a lifetime of exposure to it. No Country for Old Men exemplifies the grit of deep Texas and there's nothing better than a good chase. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell balances his dangerous chase for a monster assassin with the equally dangerous chase for a good ole' cowboy that comes down hard on the bad side of some very bad people.Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss finds himself in a dangerous dilemma when he brushes up against a bloodbath of a drug deal gone terribly bad and a satchel with 2 million dollars inside. The man looking for that money is a dispassionate and inexpressive villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The rest ensues as a thrilling triple narrative, from a determined man with 2 million dollars on the run, only hoping to escape the mess that he stumbled upon, an old man sheriff facing an evil like none he's ever seen, and a psychopathic killer, an unstoppable evil with no remorse and a extraordinary determination to find what is his.With its blood-soaked scenes, grimy West Texas setting and haunting terror filled moments between characters, No Country for Old Men is both riveting and beautiful. The dialogue is flawlessly delivered and the performances are award worthy. With almost no music in the entire film you're left immersed and focused on how the Coens utilize sounds and silence to score the film. From wind gusts and boot steps on wood floors and concrete, to deafening silence within the dialogue, it's a score that's frightening and precise.-Eric Statzer",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tangible Fear As Art,"I don't remember being so scared in a movie theater since ""Don't Look Now"" Here the Coen Brothers take everything a step further with exhilarating ease. The terror was genuine and not because we were rooting for Josh Brolin or anybody in particular. The terror was personal, Joel and Ethan Coen made that terror visceral and tangible. It has to do with our own nightmares. Josh Brolin was a perfect piece of casting because in a way he doesn't have many personal colors. He's one of the bunch, one of us and we could put ourselves in his shoes. That is the art of film narrative expressed in a way that we've never experienced before. I heard people old enough to have seen Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" in the theaters and what glued them to the screen was their own fear. Well, that's what I've experienced here. Javier Bardem is superb, considering that he's the reason for the fear. He carries a human/inhuman kind of strength and we know he'll get us, sooner or later and if we consider the ending of the film, he might still do. Worthy Oscar winners, all of it and all of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A hauntingly flawed unconventional masterpiece,"Days after seeing it, I am still haunted by No Country for Old Men. There is just something so effectual and uncompromising about it, that mere words will only begin to skim the surface of the cinematic excellence on display.At its most simplistic, the film is a game of cat and mouse. The mouse here is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon two million in cash after a drug deal gone wrong, and takes it thinking nothing of it. He tries to cover his tracks, but ends up letting the group looking for the money, figure out his identity. The cat is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hit-man hired to find Moss and the money. But Chigurh is unconventional at best; he also happens to be bordering on mentally insane. And another man, a law man this time, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), is on the trail of both men as they criss-cross around Texas.Right up until its dénouement, the film is simply brilliant. Taut and thrilling, it blows right through the majority of its two hour runtime with ease. Even during moments of slowing down, the film stays right on track and never feels like it has run its course. It engages even when it appears that nothing is happening. The Coen Brothers truly crafted what appears at first glance to be a masterpiece, even if it is their first real shot at something that is not indelibly and inarguably their own. Even without reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I know that the Coens have done it justice, even with their bitterly twisted and dark sense of humour scattered throughout the film.But all of that comes to a standstill as the film concludes. The last twenty or so minutes feel like hours as the film wraps itself up, and it almost feels like these scenes belong to another movie entirely (one that borders on being pretentious and monotonous). I realize now that McCarthy's novel probably ends the same way, but it does not help provide closure to the fact that the movie is so break-neck paced right up until this happens. Its brilliance is shattered by what looks to be a series of tattered events thrown together to provide closure for all of the characters, alive or dead, and for its audience. It speaks volumes to the film's title, but it just does not feel satisfying compared to the rest of what we saw. Even with its enigmatic devices at play, I still cannot come to terms with how the film closes. It does haunt, and in a way, it may prove to be a significantly stronger ending as time rolls on. But as it stands now, it just feels weak.What is also a bit of a surprise, and only seems to appear as the film concludes, is the music. It is not so obvious at first, but the majority of the film is audibly shown with just the sounds the characters make and no background music to speak of. This element is brilliantly used, as it helps intensify every situation and makes the film downright terrifying in some cases. It just helps truly make the film come together, and only helps establish the quick pacing even more so. It was definitely a surprise, and one that will probably help the lasting impact of the film become even stronger.The lush and bloodsoaked visuals also help to define the film. Despite the film taking place mainly in deserted areas, or the desert itself, the camera manages to capture just the right essence of what the writing and acting is conveying. The isolation and the terror almost become characters themselves through these visuals, and are sure to be recognized as the award season rolls in.The film's acting is also very well done. Brolin anchors the film and even when it is just the audience reacting to his attempts at saving his life, he manages to deliver the best performance of his career. He breathes life into Moss, and truly brings a sense of pathos to the character. We feel for him and his greedy mistake, and as he develops into a man unwilling to go down without a fight, he only manages to up the ante for himself countlessly. Jones, as the law man stuck on the fringe of every event, also does very well for himself. Most of his work is simply delivering dialogue, but it is delivered in such a fashionable sense that you feel like he is speaking to the bigger picture of things, and not just himself. I would have liked a bit more development in his character, but what little there is helps his performance greatly.Supporting turns from Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald are also done well, but are overshadowed by the main cast by both Brolin and Jones.And even more of an overcast is Bardem as the ruthless Chigurh. He absolutely nails this character down to his very bones. If anyone is merely toying with the idea of seeing the film, it should be specifically for Bardem. His performance is calculating and plagued with petrifying silence. When he chooses to talk, his words sound like they are being given by the essence of evil. This is a man with a plan, but it is one that only belongs to him. His enigmatic presence is developed throughout the film, and never once does it feel particularly appropriate to understand where this menace comes from. Watching him on screen is a jolt to the heart, and will go down as one of the best performances of the decade. His terrible hair only helps to make his character that more scary and formidable.No Country for Old Men is one of the best pictures of the year, even if it is flawed. Its brilliance and lasting impact with leave you haunted.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coen Brothers' masterful achievement,"It was not very long before I watched 'No Country for Old Men' that I watched the other remarkable film of 2007, 'There Will Be Blood.' Back then I thought that Paul Thomas Anderson has delivered the Best Picture of the year with his oil epic, but after watching the Coen brothers chilling and violent adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, I knew right away that here was a film destined to be even a greater film than any I've seen this past year.It's not easy to watch 'No Country for Old Men.' The first time I saw it, I found myself dazed enough to not be able to stand-up immediately even after the whole end credits have finished. And yet, mixed with the feeling of shock is the profound sense of wonder and awe with what I have just witnessed on the screen. It took me another viewing to fully appreciate the meaning and intention of the film, and while the experience from watching the film is not one everybody will enjoy and understand, it certainly is one of the most moving and thought-provoking movies I have ever watched. This is the kind of movie that will make you think, the kind that stays with you even after a long time has passed since you've last watched it. On the literal level, it is a simple cat-and-mouse chase thriller movie, but from within its roots lie a very profound philosophical and penetrating analysis not only of the characters and the situations involved in the story, but also of the kind of world we are living in today and the more monstrous sides of it we often choose to ignore.The story revolves around the chase between a guy named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin,) who stumbles upon a stash of money in a drug deal gone wrong in the middle of the desert and a psychopathic but surprisingly ""principled"" assassin named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). The third party and the moral center of the story is the guy trying to find both the hunter and the hunted, Ed Tom Bell, the old sheriff of a peaceful, but increasingly becoming violent locality in West Texas.The movie features the perfect mix thrill and excitement that would be expected out of a movie in this genre. The Coen brothers' direction of the particularly intense chase scenes between Chigurh and Moss are masterful, evoking emotions of suspense to the highest level and pushing the audience to the very edge of their seats. This is achieved by very careful editing and sound direction that perfectly recreates the tense atmosphere whenever a particular scene is being played out. Also remarkable is the photography (done by Roger Deakins) of vast scenes in the desert where even what the ordinary moviegoer would consider as ""empty scenes"", where no action is played out, tells a story in a visual manner, where even when there is no dialogue or action on screen, the sweeping images speak out for themselves.'No Country for Old Men' is rich in such bravura kind of film-making. The particular camera move, position and choice of background and other trivial details such as time of day, cloud cover or positioning of the props and point-of-view perspective offer the best experience for the audience, and the most effective means of story-telling for the Coen brothers. Just watch the scenes of Tommy Lee Jones as the tormented old sheriff being burdened by the challenge of something that is greater a force than himself, something that he ""does not understand,"" and you will realize what I mean. The environment and tone created by the filmmakers perfectly accentuates the performance of Jones and more importantly, the core messages of the film. This style is present throughout the film and one of the particular points that makes it more than just a chase movie.I must say that I can't help but agree to most people when they say the Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh is the most disturbing character (and yet mesmerizing) to grace the screen since Anthony Hopkins introduced us to Hannibal Lecter in 'Silence of the Lambs.' Chigurh effectively radiates evil and embodies violence in a very intelligent and forceful manner that touches the fear in all of us. Like Lecter, he personifies evil not in the conventional and simple sense, but in way that somehow presents to us the whole magnitude and complexity of its nature. In the dialogue he speaks, a kind of thinking revealed is one that is calculating and deeply philosophical but essentially ruthless and sinister.The film's monumental achievement is in its ability to remarkably transport us into a world where the places, emotions, fears, anxieties, choices, morals and realities of life are strikingly brought to life and presented to us in a manner where we, after the whole experience, can reflect upon and look back with careful consideration. In the end, the moviegoer is left to marvel at the beauty (and madness) of it all. Here the theme of innocence lost as it is corrupted by evil and violence is explored in the most cinematic fashion, delivered perfectly with richness of emotion and the greatest impact possible. The violence and bleakness of it all is not there to simply evoke reaction or engage the audience, it is there to tell a story and impart an experience of great magnitude and intention, to which the Coen brothers have brilliantly succeeded. All at the same time the movie is a character study on the effects of evil and innocence lost, an exploration on the themes of fate and chance, an analysis of the freedom to choose and its consequences, a reflection on evil and good as forces of society and the investigation of basic human emotions such as hope, fear, love, violence and aspiration in the face of a variety of situations.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Expect the Unexpected as the Coen's deliver a pneumatic jolt to the head,"There's very little ""good"" in No Country for Old Men beyond the mesmerizing acting and viciously dark screenplay. Instead, the unholy trinity of temptation, cynicism and pure, dark, evil take center stage in this modern western directed by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.Based on the 2003 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the movie unfolds in the dusty Texas borderlands as hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon the remnants of a desert drug deal gone bad, complete with a case containing two million dollars. Succumbing to temptation, Moss makes off with the money setting in motion a chain of events that leaves a trail of blood spattered carnage across the State as he is pursued by the ruthless, coin tossing hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) among whose killing weapons of choice is a pneumatic air gun.Bearing little in common with pretty much any previous Coen film with the possible exception of Blood Simple, No Country for Old Men is a dark, bleak, ode to the baser elements of the human soul, and a spit in the eye to the noble ones as well.With a structural trademark hinging upon breaking the conventional norms of predictability, No Country is a movie that will unsettle you at successive turns - in the way deaths are dealt out; by its palpable tension that can almost be cut with a knife, and its periodic deviations from the narrative norm  the latter likely the only Coen brothers ""quirk"" for which their movies are renown.Switching back and forth between the game of cat and mouse being played out by Moss and Chigurh and the investigation of unfolding events by cynical aging Texas Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the Coens weave a web of dangled threads that one can't help but expect will be neatly tied together at story's end, only to tie them up in ways that buck the storytelling norm and manage to be both unsatisfying and true to their nature at the same time.Unforgettable among this tableau is Bardem's Chigurh. The Spanish actor who has also appeared in Love in the Time of Cholera and Goya's Ghosts evokes the most amazing presence of a ruthless killer with his own twisted adherence to a bizarre code of ethics that nothing short of witnessing his performance can do it justice.Sadly, however, justice is one of the few items in abundance in this movie. And yet, as unhappy as I am that the Coen's screenplay defiantly refuses to cater to the audience's inherent desire for satisfaction, I grudgingly have to admire them for opting for the unpredictable.Consider the movie akin to one big coin toss  will it be heads or tales?

"""You don't have to do this.""","""You don't have to do this,"" repeated words in this lingering film, which really does not feel like a typical Coen Brothers film to me. Fargo, had its quirky character and its grotesque moments, but this film is all about a subdued natured intermixed with quick action. For what I expected, I got some of it, but also a bit more of a subdued air and timing than I expected. It would do things in spurts, action at the beginning then a lull and more thunder. It worked great for keeping one on edge, which Brolin did, excellently in the lead role lying awake thinking too hard. Jones too was good in a strong supporting role as a close to retirement sheriff who is on the outside shaking his head at the carnage and mayhem unleashed by the simple finding and taking of a satchel full of money.The real gem and glue of the film though is Javier Bardem's menacing character who has his own brand of justice, which is extremely harsh and well insane. Even the one who claims to know him cannot even begin to stop or even slow him down. Bardem whom I have not had the pleasure of seeing in anything before is gold and like no other before looks to have the supporting actor award locked up in this performance. His presence is felt, even when he does not show up. That is something I have not seen in film well since probably The Third Man and Orson Welles' character Harry Lime.I cannot really describe the film that well so I will suffice to say that is best modern western tale I have seen since The Three Burials of Melquiades, which also happened to have Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by him to boot. Another thing I noted was the lack of strong score. The filmmakers just seemed to let the sounds of the creaking boots and the desert landscape speak for the film. It felt natural and a bit menacing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Simply spectacular,"If you like films that literally take your breath away, then this goes to the top of the list.As stated elsewhere, Javier Bardem is so spectacularly evil and menacing that, if I were Mrs Bardem, I'd be worried about him coming home at night. The man exuded controlled evil, and I found myself not breathing when he came onto screen, yet couldn't take my eyes from him - a truly mesmerising presence.Tommy Lee Jones turns in a belter of a performance, and mention should also be made of Kelly MacDonald who nails a faultless Texan accent alongside a multi-layered performance (despite the paucity of her screen time).Beautifully shot, as you would expect, and with some (welcome) moments of humour amongst the gore, this is a very very fine film. Miss it at your peril, because when those little golden men are being handed out next year in LA, I predict a lot of them will be going to this film. A belter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Coen's display confidence in crafting yet another masterpiece,"I saw this film at a private preview screening in Pittsburg on 5/16/07. I went with five other friends. The entire group was male, 20 yrs old, and mostly college athletes. I explain the demographic of myself and my companions to reason why I was the only one that came away from the film completely satisfied. The story was fresh and different and I don't think my friends had the capacity to fully enjoy what was going on on-screen. I did. And I am still trying to fully understand what an accomplishment it is. Let me try to explain.The Coens begin the movie with a voice-over against a barren Texas landscape, much the way Blood Simple began. In fact, there are several similarities between the two films, like the auspicious lack of music. A reviewer whose name escapes me once said that all Coen Bro. films look great and sound better. I'll get to sound later but to talk about the look... Other than some CGI animals, which really shocked me in such an otherwise perfect film, each frame is filled with such interesting material that the tone is set perfectly so that as you view a scene, you know whether to wait on a laugh or brace for...A large part of what fills those frames is great performances. Perfectly cast is Tommy Lee Jones. He nails it, the crowd goes wild etc... That's expected though. Josh Brolin, on a very recent hot streak, has given us two tremendous performances this year and both would have been a Cannes if the superbly talented Tarantino was loyal to his material and friend and kept the masterpiece that was Grindhouse untouched. Brolin's performance in that film was spot on with the perfect amount of ham and cheese to set the tone for the whole movie. In this one, he shows he can do just as well playing strait and absorbing into character as he does at crowd-pleasing cheesballing it. Kelly Macdonald will have to do something else to prove to me she really isn't the Clara Jean character she portrayed even though I know she is a Scot. Woody Harrelson, who I think gets too much praise sometimes, is at his best here and actually manages not to get blown off the screen (well sorta) by Javier Bordem. Mr. Bordem's performance is a force, much like the character he portrays. His Chigurh is a representation of the lunacy of violence that exists in society. There is no negotiations with it, it has always been here and it will always be here. It/he leaves us in shock and terror and all we can do is... ??? The first thing that needs to be said about the sound is that if another film wins an award all year for sound or sound editing, investigations should be held and the judges' bank accounts monitored. The sound in this movie is so shockingly good. There is no music (save some comically placed source music)and the movie is all the better for it. People talk about the way the music in Jaws enhanced the tension of what was happening on screen. People should, from here on say that the lack of music and the placement of source sound in No Country for Old Men thrilled more.I am certainly rooting for No Country for Old Men to come away with the hardware from Cannes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You Don't Get Perfection Like This Very Often,"If you're a Coen brothers fan, you're gonna be extremely delighted with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. This is Ethan and Joel at the pinnacle of their directing careers, something that should not be missed by anyone interested in film or entertainment. Forget FARGO. Push aside THE BIG LEBOWSKI. Move over O' BROTHER WHERE ART THOU. No Country is leaps and bounds beyond those. In fact, it reigns supreme as 2007's best film.I don't always agree with movie critics but this time they got it right. It is the first time that Associated Press reviewers David Germain and Christy Lemire have both selected the same film as their #1 pick. With more award nominations than you could shake a stick at (including four Golden Globes, three Screen Actors Guilds, probably a gaggle of Oscars and many, many, many others), No Country will undeniably have directors, actors and screenwriters jumping up on stage come awards ceremony time.Equal parts thriller, western, crime-drama, and action, No Country weaves a tapestry of excellence throughout its length.The first note of excellence must be directed at Spanish actor Javier Bardem. Probably not very well known to most American audiences, Javier has cemented himself as the leader in portraying a psychopathic killer and (dare I say it!) has surpassed that of Anthony Hopkins in his SILENCE OF THE LAMBS Hannibal Lecter role (something that I thought would never happen). Ruthless, unforgiving, sociopathic, and in desperate need of a new hair style, Anton Chigurh (Bardem) is flawless. Every time he showed up on-screen I felt a chill run through my bones (""Call it""). Absolutely perfect.The next note of excellence must go to Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Llewelyn Moss (Brolin, PLANET TERROR) is the lucky/unlucky soft-spoken Texas cowpoke/hunter who stumbles across a veritable fortune in drug money only to be relentlessly pursued by killer Anton. Mr. Moss' gradual decline in health (mainly due to wounds inflicted on him by Anton) is painful to watch up until the very end. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is the opposite of Anton Chigurh. He doesn't understand all of the death and destruction laid at his feet. He longs for a time when murders were easy to track and solve, not these new-fangled deaths where bullets aren't used (air-guns do just fine) and there seems to be no rhyme or reason to their patterns.The fourth (perhaps this should've been first) note of excellence goes to the Coen brothers for their perfect adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel by the same name. Many lines of dialogue were lifted verbatim from the novel itself, including the ending monologue by Tommy Lee. It's noteworthy to mention here that the Coen brothers not only directed but wrote the screenplay, too.The final note has to go Cinematographer Roger Deakins (he's worked with the Coen brothers on many occasions and also did the exemplary JARHEAD work). Every scene was so well thought-out and so convincingly filmed that viewers are carried freakishly easy through this incredible story.It's difficult to do justice to this film with one short review, simply because there are so many great elements to it. The casting was spectacular  with Woody Harrelson (NORTH COUNTRY) and Kelly Macdonald (THE GIRL IN THE CAFÉ) pulling in exceptional supporting roles  as was Carter Burwell's haunting original musical score and Mary Zophres impeccable costume designs.If you missed this film at your local cineplex, you may have gypped yourself from experiencing this amazing cinematic event. Now you've gotta wait for the DVD to be released and then ...it's your call.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Meh,I have heard so much about this movie over the years I finally gave it a watch and I was mostly disappointed.The acting was great. The casting was great. The cinematography was top notch. But the story was pretty much just senseless violence as is common with American movies.At the end of the day it didn't make me laugh or smile; it didn't leave me pondering my existence or the meaning of life. There was really nothing to remember.,6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
MY REVIEW: Flawed Perfect Western Thriller!!,"No Country For Old Men. It's a near perfect western thriller gone somewhat wrong in the end. Hero a hunter himself finds a bag full of money from a crime scene but then gets hunted down by a crazy lunatic killer. Adding other dimensions there is aging sheriff trying to help hero without his knowledge. The movie starts and flows like a clean water with edgy characters, tricky situations and some clever ideas. Then when you are all set for bang-bang climax, movie takes a different route, plot becomes ambiguous, motives become unclear and our hero is out of the story just like that. If you are not overly miffed by the deviation in last half an hour, then you would be attracted to this like an iron to magnet because of its crazy characters, witty dialogs, haunting atmosphere and chilling silence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
*A Riveting Exploration of Fate and Morality*,"""No Country for Old Men,"" directed by the Coen Brothers and based on Cormac McCarthy's novel, is an extraordinary film that combines gripping storytelling with profound philosophical questions. Set against the stark backdrop of West Texas in the 1980s, the film follows the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, centering on three key figures: Llewelyn Moss, a hunter who stumbles upon a suitcase filled with money; Anton Chigurh, a ruthless hitman with a chilling moral code; and Ed Tom Bell, a weary sheriff grappling with the changing landscape of crime and morality.From the very start, the film captivates with its haunting cinematography, capturing the desolate beauty of the Texas landscape and amplifying the tension that permeates the story. The Coen Brothers expertly build suspense through minimal dialogue and long, atmospheric shots, allowing the tension to escalate naturally throughout the film.Javier Bardem delivers an unforgettable performance as Anton Chigurh, a character defined by his cold and calculated nature. His portrayal is both menacing and magnetic, making Chigurh one of the most iconic villains in modern cinema. In contrast, Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss brings a sense of desperation and resourcefulness, while Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Sheriff Bell adds depth and gravitas, embodying the film's central themes of aging, morality, and the struggle to maintain one's sense of right in a world that appears increasingly chaotic.The screenplay is masterfully crafted, staying true to McCarthy's narrative style while allowing the Coen Brothers to infuse their own distinctive touches. The film raises essential questions about fate, chance, and the nature of evil, prompting viewers to reflect on the choices made by each character and the overarching implications of their actions.The absence of a traditional score further enhances the film's atmosphere, leaving the audience to absorb the tension and existential dread that permeates every scene. The CLIMAX and subsequent resolution deviate from conventional expectations, eliciting a profound sense of contemplation among viewers as they grapple with the film's ambiguous ending.""No Country for Old Men"" is a masterclass in storytelling, direction, and performance. It is a film that defies easy categorization and leaves an indelible mark on its audience. With its exploration of morality, fate, and the relentless passage of time, it stands as one of the most significant films of the 21st century-a gripping reminder of the complexities of human nature and the unsettling realities of life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
a real aural treat,"there will be plenty of other reviews here on the story, acting etc etc but maybe less on the sound in the movie so i'll focus on that here..the Coen brothers are well known for paying close attention to detail in their soundtracks. i've always found in the past though that they have a tendency to go over the top with this, and the sound can become a little pretentiousnot so here. they don't try to do anything outlandish with the soundtrack but tremendous detail is placed on the effects and atmos in particular.just about everything sounds wonderful from the dropping of a bag, the uncurling of a wrapper to more 'interesting' sounds like the ricochet of a bullet from a metal bridge and of course the fantastic signature sound of our bad guy.. the nail/air gun. some wonderful atmos in the air duct for example, and even on the polished metal of a blown out door lock. subtle and excellent use of the surrounds is made, and i especially liked how they used this with some of the dialogueoverall i was really impressed. and as you'll likely hear elsewhere, the rest of the film was great too!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Amazing film with an incredible acting on display,"Fargo, had its quirky character and its grotesque moments, but this film is all about a subdued natures intermixed with quick action. For what I expected, I got some of it, but also a bit more of a subdued air and timing than I expected. It would do things in spurts, action at the beginning then a lull and more thunder. It worked great for keeping one on edge, which Brolin did, excellently in the lead role lying awake thinking too hard. Jones too was good in a strong supporting role as a close to retirement sheriff who is on the outside shaking his head at the carnage and mayhem unleashed by the simple finding and taking of a satchel full of money.The real gem and glue of the film though is Javier Bardem's menacing character who has his own brand of justice, which is extremely harsh and well insane. Even the one who claims to know him cannot even begin to stop or even slow him down. Bardem whom I have not had the pleasure of seeing in anything before is gold and like no other before looks to have the supporting actor award locked up in this performance. His presence is felt, even when he does not show up. That is something I have not seen in film well since probably The Third Man and Orson Welles' character Harry Lime.I cannot really describe the film that well so I will suffice to say that is best modern western tale I have seen since The Three Burials of Melquiades, which also happened to have Tommy Lee Jones and was directed by him to boot. Another thing I noted was the lack of strong score. The filmmakers just seemed to let the sounds of the creaking boots and the desert landscape speak for the film. It felt natural and a bit menacing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Such great compelling characters,"Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) laments the bygone peaceful times of his father and grandfather. Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is a weird killer with a compressed air pistol. Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes across a drug deal gone wrong in the desert. The bad guys killed each other leaving the drugs behind. Llewelyn recovers a suitcase full of cash. He doesn't even tell his wife Carla Jean Moss (Kelly Macdonald) at first. He returns to the desert that night, and is shot by the criminals. They have his car and he expects them to come after him. He sends his wife away while he tries to hide the $2 million. Chigurh is brought in to track down the money and promptly kills the drug criminals who hired him. Sheriff Bell and deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt) investigates. The cartel hires Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) to stop Chigurh and get back the money.Javier Bardem creates a memorable villain. The Coen brothers have brilliant eyes for such uniqueness.

Great Till the End,"No Country for Old Men (2007)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A hunter (Josh Brolin) comes across a group of trucks with dead bodies everywhere and discovers $2 million in cash, which he takes. Soon a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) is after him while a local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) tries to figure out what's going on. I'll start off by saying that I'm not a big fan of the Coen brothers. With that out of the way, this is certainly the best movie I've seen from them but it goes downhill very quickly in the final thirty-minutes, which are quite horrid to be honest. However, everything before that is masterfully done with a beautiful craft that makes this familiar story come off very original, dark and at times funny. I really enjoyed the slow pace that the film carries but I'm not sure if that's how I should describe it. The movie has plenty of graphic violence and action and what makes it so shocking is that it usually comes out of no where or happens when you don't expect it. The pace of the film is slow but this helps when the violence breaks out. The performances are all terrific with Bardem stealing the show as the psychotic killer. Whenever he's on screen you can't take your eyes off of him and his silent performance speaks more than any words could. I was also very impressed with Brolin who I'm usually hit and miss on. Woody Harrelson has a few nice scenes and Tommy Lee Jones is the old Tommy Lee Jones we all love. The film was a lot of fun until the conclusion, which I thought was quite awful.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Flawless,"No Country for Old Men is the movie that has everyone talking; this morning, I was reading how this is going to be the Oscar winning movie, I just had to find out where it was playing. I just saw this with my friend this afternoon and I was blown away. It's a little odd because this did not seem like a typical movie that I would love, but the performances were absolutely flawless and the writing was brilliant. My friend just kept saying how horrible it was, but I don't think some people are going to understand how great this movie really is or need to see it again to understand it. I was never really a fan of the Coen Brothers and their work, but the reason why I loved this movie is due to the fact that it points out the violence in the world and how far people will go to get money or drugs. No Country for Old Men is blunt and shows the ultimate evil of the world, but also the good as well.Llewelyn Moss is a cowboy who has just encountered quite a find, he stumbles across the desert to find several dead bodies and a truck load of heroin. When he walks a little farther, he finds another dead body, but there's something in a suit case that's a little bit more of what he could use, 2 million dollars! He's got everything in the clear, but he remembers one of the bodies that survived and needed water, so he goes back to help him out, big mistake. Now the serial killer who owned that money and drug load is after him. This serial killer, Anton Chigurh, is possibly the most cold blooded murderer and will not stop until he has his money and Llewelyn is dead. But also Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is trying to find Anton and find Llewelyn before it gets more deadly.No Country for Old Men is the most brilliantly written movie of the year. Javier Bardem, who plays Anton, will hopefully get an Oscar nomination for his performance. Javier pulled such a chilling performance, he was terrific and so frightening, I never really took a look at his talent until No Country for Old Men. Josh Brolin, it's truly amazing how far this man has come, from The Goonies to a gut-wrenching performance, he's great. Tommy Lee Jones also held his own very well and made the sheriff the most likable character and was the light in this dark movie. No Country for Old Men is a great movie, believe me, it's worth the watch, just take some time after the movie to think about it and what you have just seen, because for the first time, I can say that the Coen Brothers are really amazing.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This movie was so intense,"This movie was so intense in the cinematography and the sins of danger and slow rolling tension that is the most theme I can find it this movie the feeling of slowly getting attacked and not knowing when and where.The main antagonist is some of the most scary villain, I have seen in a movie, Just chaos happening without a reason we can see as an audience, he determination almost make him feel like the predator. He is a horror villain.The contrast they uses where most of the scenes have a dark shadow to the mix it look so distinct and good and all the shooting when people get shots look so gory and disgusting in the best possible way it gives it a really big punch shots happens.And the way the characters are a few words makes it almost a silent movie where you have to judge it by the characters movement and the few lines they say it is so good and makes it so more tense.The actors did an amazing job and was totally believable I didn't not happen to find a logic floor anything like that.

This film is near perfect.,"As a large proponent of ""Show, don't tell"", I'd say that this is in one of my top-ten movies. It's a marvel in the power understatement. Just simple actions like picking up the casing after shooting a deer make characters seem that much more real and deep. The rolling valleys, and corporate roads perfectly capture both the identity and the plight of the modern South-west. The lack of music and the addition of little background noises like the commotion in the streets, and the blowing of the wind make this movie almost seem like it's real. I felt like I was really there the entire movie. Is there plot holes? Maybe. This is a film that you have to pay attention to and pick up on the subtleties. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing I'll leave up to you. For me at least, my favorite things about this movie is the atmosphere and the subtlety. The actors also put in good performances, with Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh ultimately being the character that everyone remembers and talks about. I highly recommend this movie to people who can overcome its slow pace and general lack of explicit explanation. It's a 9.5/10, an excellent movie. And no, I don't pretend to ""get"" this movie. Whether you do or don't is not a sign of your intelligence, so much as how much you think this movie is worth getting into.

Old Men is Old Coen,"The Coen brothers are on firmer and more familiar territory with this Texas noir based on the Cormac Mc Carthy novel. Trailer park resident Llewellyn Moss stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad in the Texas desert and makes off with the fortune in cash. A machine like but philosophical psychopathic killer is soon in pursuit. An aging sheriff takes up pursuit of both with little success as bodies begin to litter the territory.The film is filled with some highly suspenseful moments and for the most part remains that way for much of the film. The pace maintains itself by shifting back and forth between three characters with a detour here and there to introduce other players and plot twists. The diversions and turns eventually become wearisome though and Country starts to slow down.No Country is vintage Coen. After the Big Lebowski (a worthy follow-up to their masterpiece Fargo) the brothers seemed to have lost their edge with four lackluster efforts. Country recalls their superb earlier works such as Raising Arizona, Blood Simple and Fargo and therein lies part of the problem. A lot of Country has scenes and characters directly lifted from these works.The Coen's are masters at oblique dialogue that gets to the heart of the matter and many scenes resonate with these elements giving them both tension and humor. Their originality and unpredictability of action and character can raise suspense in the most benign of settings. Their heroes and villains are complex. They are not 24-7 people of virtue or mindless cruelty. Their quirks flesh out and bring depth to their character thus increasing the possible directions of the plot.Tommy Lee Jones as the Sheriff is a burned out Andy of Mayberry moving from middle age crisis to old age and the uncertainty of retirement, always a step behind the bad guys. Jones conveys his fatigue and dogged determination in a fine measured way. Josh Brolin is even better as Moss who goes to great lengths to hold onto the money. Brolin, who stole acting honors in American Gangster as a corrupt jersey cop does so here as well as a stoic Texan. Based on these two roles alone he could be Americas best working actor. Woody Harrelson is badly miscast as a contract killer in a throw away role.What ultimately makes No Country for Old Men a disappointment is the handling of the villain, Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. The film, grounded in a dusty realism slowly starts to fall apart as Chigurh moves across the landscape like Boris Karloff offing locals with an unconcealed customized weapon. Even after a dozen people have been eliminated by Chigurh you get the impression that only Sheriff Bell is looking for him since Chigurh has no problem moving freely about spreading mayhem. The fascinating character that Chigurh is (he seems to be searching for the meaning of life as well as the stolen money) at the film's beginning degenerates into a Schwarzenegian Terminator manqué by the final reel and this strains the credulity of the movie beyond its breaking point.With Country the brothers Coen may be out of the rut that plagued there last few works but their wheels are still spinning.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good,"Several times watching 'No Country for Old Men',
Because I really like Javier too much The assassin portrayed by Baden.Not only because he performed well,
Because I like the way assassins do things,
It's not that they enjoy killing,
I like that kind of slow and steady rhythm,
The rhythm of walking towards what one must do.Watching this film again,
I went with the question of 'why is there no one to rely on in old age',
Because my attention was focused on the killer before,
The answer to this question was actually found in the killer,
I have gained my own understanding.The assassin in the film represents more than just the Grim Reaper,
More importantly, it represents the impermanence of life's destiny,
Every person that the assassin passes by in the film represents a normal pattern and order,
Representing the experience patterns that have been accumulated over the years and are applicable to most people.The ""impermanence"" represented by assassins includes: irregularity, illogical, unordered, abnormal, random change, and constant change.That is to say, based on normal circumstances and experience, what should happen next,
There is no such thing as' should 'in the assassin's system.The police officer who caught the killer at the beginning of the film,
I never thought of it,
The assassin who has already been handcuffed,
I can still kill him.This is' impermanence ',

Disappointing...,"It definitely had its redeeming qualities, but overall I was rather let down and found it to be somewhat over-hyped. I expected this to be the Coen Brothers masterpiece thus far, a new level for them, but it still seemed to be the same old same old. Now Javier Bardem (where did this guy come from??) plays an excellent villain, you can see it in his eyes alone. He's completely ruthless and without a conscience to the point that it's just funny. And that's vintage Coen Brothers right there- this kind of black humor. There's some great dialogue, and even some classic moments of stylized violence that give it real potential. Watch for one memorable scene involving a very explosive diversion this villain creates outside a small-town pharmacy. The film moves at a rather slow pace, and taking place in the southwest, the Coen Brothers, as they did in ""O Brother Where Art Thou,"" seem to rely too much on southern stereotypes for humor's sake rather than a true knowledge and understanding of the south. Still worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coen Brothers strike again,"Joel and Ethan Coen know how to tell a story -- sometimes its meaning is obscure, sometimes it's in your face, but it's always fascinating.In the obscure category is ""No Country for Old Men,"" from 2007, starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, and Barry Corbin.What I'm going to write next will mystify many. In a funny way, this film reminded me of Psycho. Here's why - in Psycho, we're led to believe that it's a story about a woman who steals money from her employer. Then she stops at the Bates Motel, and the story changes.Same deal here. This starts off as a story of a man who steals money he finds at a drug deal gone wrong, and we believe we're watching him trying to escape the man chasing him. Turns out the movie isn't really about that.In Texas in 1980, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the scene of a drug deal gone terribly wrong - the ground is peppered with dead bodies. Also laying around unattended is 2 million dollars, which Moss takes.As a result, a man named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is after him. Chigurh kills just about anybody who crosses his path. Moss is on the run, and Chigurh is close behind every step of the way.The sheriff, Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), has become discouraged by the evil in the world and his helplessness in the face of it. Nevertheless, he tries to beat Chigurh to Moss, all the while realizing the job has just about burned him out. It is, in fact, no country for old men.The film is symbolic of evil in human form (Chigurh) coming up against a decent man (Moss) and how it brings about his ruin. Moss' ego and arrogance make him think he can overcome Chigurh's pure evil. His innate goodness compels him to return with water for the one dying drug dealer at the scene, putting Chigurh on his trail when he finds his truck. Temptation, as in the Garden of Eden, can lead to ruin.All the men involved in the story -- Chigurh, Moss, Bell, and an old man whom Bell visits, Ellis - are all fatalists. Moral weakness allows the gods to wreak havoc. Llewellyn brings his fate on himself, and the fate can't be stopped. And so much that happens seems to happen by chance, as the result of a coin toss -- for someone like Bell, looking for meaning, there is no meaning to be found.The Coen Brothers take the western genre and turn it on its boots - we don't witness some of the deaths, and we don't witness the classic good versus evil fight. With Sheriff Bell's retirement, it seems that we are to conclude that evil wins. But the Coen Brothers leave us with hope, as long as we don't depend on mankind for it. Like Bell's dream about his father going ahead and starting a fire for him, the hope is outside of ourselves and our world. As we've seen in court cases, there is no getting of justice in this world. At the end of his dream, Bell says, ""I woke up,"" as we all must.A remarkable film by remarkable filmmakers, demanding multiple viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best brothers Coen movies,"If you want a movie about a likable but menacing hero (or perhaps antihero), then this is a movie for you. An effective agent of fate, Javier Bardem's character does not care what you think about his haircut or his ways. What he cares about are rules. But not your rules, he has a set of his own, just like in his world, he has the coolest haircut there is. And he wears it with confidence. The same confidence he executes his tagets, who have it coming. One way or the other, on the flip of a coin. And his ways are memorable, you have to give him that. This angel of death plays some sort of cat and mouse game, but this is not a man, this is a sublime being, and he is magnificent, inspiring awe. Cant say awesome since this word is ruined in the English language, but in 1940s, it would have been the most appropriate way to describe what the actor Bardem delivers. This is a must see movie...",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Room for Platitudes,"This film really gripped me, but not in any spectacular way, more for the un/ethical values that often creep through the film at quite inopportune times. Despite the violence -although credibly a restrained use of foul-language- the film cannot really be said to be brutal, and instead examines the sinful natures of two men, who both mete out the seven equally, and never really balance the moral with the ethical value of life over the pursuit of death; instead they pursue their own agendas without regard to society or the law. By the close of the film it could equally be argued the law is culpable in sharing the pie of sin.Another intriguing element is that none of the main protagonists actually meet face-to-face, despite the cat and mouse battle between Bardem and Brolin. This may reflect the changing state of crime in the US, at least on film. In classic cowboy film the two protagonists would ultimately end face to face, or be overwhelmed by the forces of good and admonished from our conscience. But in NCFOM the law in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones is reduced to an ineffective theologian mulling over the changing nature of society in the face of law, and as such most of the revealing discourse comes through Jones.There are subtle elements to the film that carry the tale beyond the end, and often cause you to view the film to reason the logic for such simple elements such as when both characters desperately seek to purchase a shirt to evade a critical moment. All of which proves Joel and Ethan Cohen are becoming incredible talents in Hollywood, and their determination to do something new with script often translates into intriguing and dramatic film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An excruciatingly brilliant movie,"No Country for Old Men is a movie that will most likely flop in theaters. It is not the kind of flick you will hear people raving about (unless you have a lot of movie-addicts as friends) and flocking to the production in large numbers. It is not the kind of movie that most people will want to see over and over again. But this is also perhaps the precise reason why it is such a thrilling, fantastic film that will garner ridiculous adoration from a subset of viewers who don't like their action movies spoon fed to them by Hollywood with Will Smith delivering witty one-liners throughout. No Country for Old Men stands on its own as one of the finest action movies ever produced, though to call it simply an ""action"" movie drastically understates the ambitious reach of author Cormac McCarthy and producers Joel and Ethan Coen.Set in the Southwestern United States, No Country is a story about Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who finds $2 million in cash in a drug deal in the middle of the desert, with no one around to guard it except several decaying bodies. Being a poor man clutching to existence in a remote part of the country, he decides to keep the money and hope for the best. When Anton Chigurh, played unsettlingly by Javier Bardem, comes looking for the money, the entire plot becomes ""a mess,"" as Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) succinctly puts it. This movie is the opposite of a B-rate slaughterhouse of gore and torture. It chooses to seethe, to ooze tension and leave our imaginations to do the worst. Rather than club you over the head with grisly pictures, the machinations of the Coen brothers are carefully sculpted to extract the maximum amount of impact from each confrontation while keeping the gore to an essential minimum.Part of what makes No Country so brilliant is how focused each scene appears to us, how they delight in the subtle nuances of character, portraying them as common individuals who are mostly clueless to deal with the changing forces around them. The austere humor of each individual echoes this, as they deliver their own guileless assessments of life and love, delivered in a Southwestern slang that many will mistake for a lack of wisdom. Yet each role here is superbly designed to beg for reflection, to ponder the choices they made, and to examine their own flaws and virtues. In short, every character means something to the plot, and the ramifications of what happens to them are always noticed and felt by the viewer. When one dies, it releases a torrent of emotion that will leave us feeling bereft of something substantial.And that is perhaps the most significant departure from the typical movie of No Country for Old Men. The action scenes here are visceral, they are gripping, and they are well-designed, the same as many other films appearing this year in theaters. What is different here is intuition of the directors, who realize that silence in a gunfight can provide much more tension than a constant rain of bullets. The most unbearable moments in No Country are the seconds before the trigger is pulled, where life and death are temporarily suspended. After each confrontation, an audible gasp is almost necessary. This film is equally as unnerving because the next battle is always around the corner  if not with guns, then with words, and if not with words, with the idea of how to deal with death, life, and our past.It is in these somber ruminations that No Country is saved from being a nihilistic retelling of fate. Without the distantly observant comments made by Tommy Lee Jones' character (Bell), the earnest method by which Moss (Brolin) moves through the scenes with an uneasy balance between fear and arrogance, or the chilling ideology of Chigurh (Bardem), this movie would have been another two hours of mindless bloodletting, as desolate as the landscape. Instead, No Country is full of choices, consequences, and the motives that drive us, a film that stands tall in a sea of much poorer clones. Even the ending, which may leave some scratching their head, and others angered, is as devastatingly stark and unapologetic as the rest of the production, offering no ""feel better"" pill, only the vague ideas of a desperate situation, and a person who has simply had enough. It is potentially the most unnerving quality in the entire film: The ending is simply too realistic for its own good, departing from underneath our conscience with only a few words to see us home. What is not spoken aloud is what makes No Country for Old Men a classic. Hard to watch, and easy to enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Emporer's New (No) Clothes,"What is all the hype about? An eight point nine IMDb rating as of 11-23-07? Can't anyone see the emperor has no clothes here? I went to this movie based on the IMDb rating and the fact that it was a Coen Brothers movie, but I have to say I wasted 8 bucks and could've waited for the DVD. I was ready for a good, satisfying story of underdog revenge (the way it was marketed) and ended up with ""why old men shouldn't retire, because it was just as bad in the old days as it is now."" Josh Brolin could've been another Russell Crowe (a la Gladiator - so good was his performance), but it wasn't to be.I felt like I was sold a bill of goods. To blame is both the marketeers and the ignorant voters on IMDb. Rarely does IMDb fail me, but I have been noticing of late a genuine shift into hyped up voting based on writer/director reputation and/or underground buzz. It was a great movie two thirds of the way through, but the last third leaves so much to be desired (because of plot change) that I began wondering if the emperors Coen were caught in their skivvies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What's The Most You've Ever Lost in a Coin Toss?,"There is not a single flaw I can think of with this film. It is one of the most meticulously crafted and perfected pieces of art ever put to screen. The Coens directed this film with such mastery, precision and restraint. I don't think I've ever seen a better example of less is more in a film. It would be a sin not to mention the cinematography. Roger Deakins once again knocks it out of the park with his beautiful frames. He is without a doubt my favorite cinematographer. The acting is superb. Javier Bardem was absolutely terrifying as Anton Chigurh, truly one of the greatest villains in cinematic history. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones both give the greatest performances of their careers. This film is a masterclass in tension. This is best complemented by the use of silence. There is no music in this film. (Apart from the end credits of course) Which makes for some of the most anxiety-inducing scenes I have ever witnessed. But at it's core, the film is about the inevitably of death and the passing of time. I will not spoil it but this film contains one of the most beautifully ambiguous endings ever, it fully contributes to its themes. No Country For Old Men is another one of my indisputable all time favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliant Game of Cat and Mouse,"""You can't help but wonder how the old timers would operate in these times,"" narrates Sheriff Ed in thick and alluring southwestern drawl. We soon find out exactly what he means by ""these times."" Llewelyn is hunting in a remote and arid grassland, stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and manages to get away with a bundle of cash. While Llewelyn covers his tracks, keeps his mouth shut and is smart, tough and resourceful, he may not be prepared for what is coming for him in the form of tracker Anton Chigurh. A person without empathy is more dangerous than a coward, and Chigurh is cold, cruel, relentless and methodical. He figures out not just where people are, but where they will be. As Chigurh pursues Llewelyn, others are close behind including Sheriff Ed, a drug cartel, other trackers and Llewelyn's girlfriend, only a few of whom are cut out for this game of cat and mouse.Ten years after the release of the film and it is well understood how it made or sealed the careers of Javier Bardem (Chigurh), Josh Brolin (Llewelyn), Tommy Lee Jones (Ed) and not least of all the Coens who are some of the best directors in the business. Here the Coens are firing on all cylinders. The film is complex, thrilling and multi-layered. It is full of great lines. Its occasional extreme brutality is offset with wit, charm and humor. Adding to the compelling characters are amazing performances by Jones, Bardem and Brolin. They are perfectly cast. The voice of Jones alone is authentic and enthralling. Bardem is truly chilling. He speaks, moves and acts like a ghost. There are beautiful shots of the southwestern landscape in the morning light and intriguing close-ups of the characters. There is delight even in little details; a coin flip, a drink of milk, a cat and the banter of minor characters. Such attention to detail is a mark of the brilliance of the Coens. The film is set in the 1970s and is based on a story by Cormac McCarthy. This is one of my favorite films (top 20) of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"No country for young men, either","At various moments in ""No Country for Old Men,"" we are shown rusty, weather-beaten windmills squeaking in the dry desolation of the American Southwest, doing their 360-degree revelations in the passing wind. This imagery ties in nicely with the elliptical nature of the characters and plot (based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy), but also shows Joel and Ethan Coen coming full circle within their own career, as this film plays like a ""desert noir"" companion to their debut feature, ""Blood Simple"" (1985).The brothers' requisite plot devicea large sum of money being stolen and sought afterfinds an Everyman foil in Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who happens upon a massacre site where a drug deal went awry, and makes off with a satchel of cash pried from a dead man's hands. His wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) is skeptical, and it is not until Llewelyn commits an act of charity that he finds himself in a relentless chase to outrun the innumerable factions seeking the cash. As in McCarthy's novel, these factions are vaguely defined at best, save for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a seemingly indestructible boogeyman who possesses no loyalty, and only the faintest trace of humanity (some of his potential victims are absolved by the luck of a coin toss). Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (one of the ""old men"" of the title, played with depth and grace by Tommy Lee Jones) is the outsider intermediary, whose own jaded feelings toward the inexplicable senselessness of crime in America is magnified in the increasingly nihilistic pursuit between Chigurh and Moss.""No Country"" is like a symphony of aesthetics, with the Coens showing an affinity for wide-angle photography (captured by DP Roger Deakins) of the vast American Southwest; close-ups of faces of a variety of ages, weathered by age or fatigue or shrapnel; sound-effects editing so razor-precise that the squeaking of an oxygen valve or the clicking of a safety-catch in an otherwise silent scene is enough to inspire chills. Also worth noting is the absence of musical score, with Carter Burwell's orchestrations swelling only a few moments after the end credits have started to roll.I find it refreshing that, in our era of cinematic spectacle, replete with CGI-candy, that ""No Country"" derives much of its impact from the characters themselves, often filmed in the aforementioned close-ups that makes their dialogues resonate with a profoundalmost meditativeurgency, conveyed wonderfully in the subtly understated performances. This is an interesting adaptive choice on the Coens' part, since many of their films take a parodic approach toward ""country folk"" as witless yokels designed as vessels for comedy. And while ""No Country"" finds some clever comic asides (Moss's exchange with a testy American border guard is a gem), the tone is that of pervasively ominous uncertaintythe tags of ""hero"" and ""villain"" are not easily applied, and the Coens are not above showing the moral ambiguity of their characters with a flatly objective eye.And the performances are indicative of this flat objectivity. Talented character actor Josh Brolin (""The Goonies""; ""Grindhouse"") embodies the quirks, flaws, and traits (both heroic and anti-heroic) of Llewelyn; Bardem is a towering iceberg of intimidation, whose Chigurh becomes an almost-infallible extension of some mythic desert dweller (existing solely in a world of self-obligation and passive violence); Jones brings a worldly wisdom and depth to Ed Tom, the glue that bonds the narrative; English actress Macdonald (probably best known for ""Trainspotting"") slips into a Southern accent and conveys the necessary fearand finally, acceptanceof being an unwitting pawn in a situation beyond her control.In the end, there is a paradoxical thematic synthesis as two characters ""walk away"" from obligation and into a future that is, at best, uncertain (the characters ""unite"" in a slow fade); and while Bell's closing recollection of a dream veers into Oscar-nod territory, it perfectly resolves ""No Country for Old Men,"" a story so open-ended and incendiary that its grislier moments could easily be culled from today's national headlines. The movie may be set in 1980, but its parable-like presentation will prove timeless. One of 2007's best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Beautiful but barren...,"I'm maybe not the best person to review No Country for Old Men. I long ago became tired of movies about assassins, drugs, shootings, and suitcases full of money. I feel as though Hollywood has been recycling the same seedy crime material for years - and so have the Coen brothers. Movies like this one, Fargo, Blood Simple, Sin City, Pulp Fiction, and Smokin' Aces all seem to come from the same mold, and that mold is getting mighty overused, in my opinion.On the plus side, I think the Coen brothers are uniquely gifted at presenting this kind of material. Indeed, No Country for Old Men is, in many ways, one of the most beautiful and suspenseful films that I've seen in a long time. It's full of striking images of the desert, interesting point-of-view shots, and incredibly intimate close-ups of actors with fascinating faces. Even the sound effects are great; they're loud, vivid and realistic, and they genuinely enhance the action.But beyond all that surface glitz, what is the movie about? I never really understood or cared for any of the characters. The protagonist is unsympathetic from the beginning, for instance. Tommy Lee Jones, meanwhile, gives a good performance but seems to be virtually trapped in a subplot. Furthermore, his ""deep"" dialog did very little for me - ""mock profundity"" is perhaps an apt description. The villain is great, I suppose, but once you've seen him kill twelve people, there's not much point in seeing him kill a thirteenth, is there?I don't want to bury this movie, because it's very well done. But I'm annoyed that, at usual, film critics and students are heaping an avalanche of praise on a movie that's really violent, really strange, and really alienating. Yeah, sure, it plays with narrative conventions in interesting ways. But it doesn't take true genius to frustrate an audience's expectations, and storytelling gimmicks alone can't save a story that's so barren. I suppose you could hunt for deeper meaning - as people tend to do on message boards - but I don't think there's much to find. The movie is a beautiful toy, and not too much more.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Didn't get it.,"I've seen all of the Coen Bros. films, and have had no trouble following the story-lines - until now. I was left with far too many questions in the end to give this film a high rating. I tried to like it, given it's critical reviews, but found portions of it rather boring, and also couldn't figure out how certain characters got involved in the story at all. They often seemingly appeared out of nowhere, leaving you to ponder who they were and what relationship they had to other characters as the movie rolled on. And the ending has been well-documented. I would guess most viewers basically zone out at that point anticipating the next bit of action, and the next bit of action is the credits scrolling by. Fargo and The Big Lebowski remain on top of my Coen Bros. list, with No Country perhaps bringing up the rear. I have no trouble with movies that reqire some thought, but am not a big fan of those that simply try to confuse you.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Blood, not so Simple","A Vietnam vet (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and casually takes off with two million dollars that a psychopathic bounty hunter (Javier Bardem) will do anything to get back. Meanwhile, a Sheriff nearing retirement (Tommy Lee Jones) strolls behind the mayhem always a few steps behind. Set in Texas in 1980, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a meticulously crafted misfire from the Coen Brothers and adapted for the screen from the Cormac McCarthy novel.Roger Deakin's stark cinematography matches perfectly the brilliant mise-en-scene and signature Coen Brothers' pacing. The audience is also treated to a revolving door of quirky side characters and dark deadpan humor in the dialog that have become the trademarks of a Coen Brothers' dramatic production. It would seem to be a return to form, but there's a wandering coldness to the film that leads to grave dissatisfaction.The most disappointing aspect is that there's a near perfect forty-five minute ""mini film"" riddled with white knuckle suspense involving the cat-and-mouse shoot-em-up between Bardem and Brolin that is lost inside yet another dour opus where Tommy Lee Jones plays a grizzled but good-hearted authority figure philosophizing about the sad state of the world for the umpteenth time. While Bardem and Brolin are sensational, Tommy Lee Jones seems to be playing an on-screen persona that has trumped his ability to show any type of range. He's typecast, and his character is made moot. Meanwhile Bardem gives a career-defining performance as the psychopath working with his own warped sense of morals. In what may prove to be ironic in the future, it's exactly the type of portrayal that risks making Bardem typecast in the same vein Anthony Hopkins was after his Hannibal Lecter character was born.The brooding tension built around Bardem's unforgettable villain and the inevitable showdown with Brolin's wayward cowboy is completely wasted in anti-climactic fashion with no resolution that leaves the film to meander in philosophies that ultimately signify nothing. Coming off three straight comedies (the last two of which, ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", were abysmal) the Coen Brothers have clearly lost their footing in trying to get back to their roots. ""No Country for Old Men"" boasts many of their popular hallmarks and an instantly classic turn from Javier Bardem, but it lacks the moral fiber of ""Fargo"" and the dramatic climax of ""Blood Simple"". Coming home, it seems, isn't as easy as it looks when the roads are dusty and lead you nowhere.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Then he woke up.,"'No Country For Old Men (2007)' has a tangible grit to it; you can almost feel the very fabric of the film itself. It's a calm and methodical meditation on the changing nature of both crime itself and the world at large (with a focus on America, in particular). It maintains its slow pace even during its bluntly violent action sequences, which are often genuinely intense. The piece is surprisingly suspenseful, providing proper thrills alongside its pseudo philosophical pondering. It doesn't spoon-feed you anything; you have to work to understand its plot and, even, characters, which are both relatively elusive and purposefully amoral. The flick makes no judgements on its players, even though some are truly despicable, and it doesn't provide easy explanations or motivations for some of their actions. This makes for an engaging experience that encourages rather deep thinking. The movie isn't as straightforward as its pretty by-the-numbers set-up would suggest. It undercuts itself at, arguably, its most important moment, subverting expectation with an unconventional yet shockingly effective final third. It really is brilliant. The film feels substantial, a resonant commentary on the ever-evolving yet always cyclical nature of violence and the pure randomness of fate. It stays with you for quite a while after it's over, both providing in-the-moment excitement and provoking retroactive reflection. It's a confident and considered affair right from the start.

-----
""Well, I got here the same way the coin did.""No Country for Old Men is a 2007 film directed by the Coen Brothers, adapted from a book by the same name that was released two years prior. It's considered by many to be the best Coens' film, and it's the second film of theirs that I watch (the previous was Fargo, which I liked quite a bit).The movie follows Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a Texas man who finds one day a large sum of money, with enough evidence around to know that it's blood money alright. He takes it anyway, and this action sets in motion a game of cat-and-mouse, as Moss flees from the Mexican cartel and one Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a cold-blooded man you definitely don't want to encounter in real life. There's also the town sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), who tries to reach Moss first and get him to a safe place.One thing that makes this film pretty immersive for me for most of its runtime is the lack of music in the background for almost the entire runtime of this movie. Most of the sounds we hear are diegetic - the wind blowing, a light switch switched off, soft footsteps getting closer. Even when there is some music it's very, very subtle. This film pulls it off pretty well, especially in the tenser, slow-burning scenes.The second thing I want to focus on is something you've probably heard of even if you're yet to watch this film but you have some background on it - Chigurh, the villain, is probably the most memorable aspect of No Country for Old Men. For me, also the best part of the film. Javier Bardem delivered a precise performance here, which granted him the Oscar for best supporting actor, but it's more than that. Chigurh is so effective because of how clever, how ruthless, how methodical and cold-blooded he is. He's also somewhat alien, following his set of rules that we can't completely understand, and it makes him more creepy and unexpected and, well, entertaining. The cat-and-mouse game is so effective mostly because both characters involved do a lot of creative and clever things that are shown to us so we can put the puzzle pieces together ourselves. It's making the watching experience more active. Comparing it to Death Note may be a bit of a stretch but I feel like it's worth bringing up.The film is filled to the brim with violence that is almost casual, character deaths that happen in a blink of an eye, bloodshed that isn't shown in any dramatic or grand way. It's just there. The main idea of the film, the way I see it at least, is how chaotic and random and scary the world is, and always has been. Just like Chigurh (which is key to understand the underlying message in my opinion), the world has its own set of rules that we can't quite understand, and we try to bargain with the world but in the end it gets us all. Always was like this, complicated and dangerous and full of odd rules.I'll also briefly address the cinematography, which I find really solid and well-crafted, and the dialogue, which has a lot of cynical wit and iconic moments which I'm sure will stick with me for a while.The ending of this film, while I can understand the artistic value behind it, still makes the story feel somewhat incomplete to me. Maybe it will be a motif with the Coen Brothers' films and me, I don't know, but I'd even say that it bothers me here more than it does in Fargo, since here the choice to end this story in such an odd way is much more unexpected and extreme than the lack of catharsis in Fargo. It just bothers me, even if I get the reasoning behind it.I'd say that when it comes to emotional investment I wasn't really there, and I know that it's not this kind of movie but I still feel like I should've cared a little more for Moss as a character than I actually did, which isn't to say that I don't like the character at all but something doesn't fully click with me, for some reason.Overall, No Country for Old Men is an interesting take on the premise of being one against the world, and it provides a very well-made display of a clever cat-and-mouse game with a lot of bloodshed and gunpowder. The villain is especially great. The ending feels a little off to me, and though I know why it still doesn't fully click with me. Still, a good movie. I'm feeling a 7.8/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Perfect Execution,"I always go back to this film when I want to get lost in the perfectly crafted story. The plot is simplicity itself, and on the surface, so are many of the characters, at least, in the world they live in. But in true Coen Brother's fashion, each and every character that graces the screen has depth, authenticity, humanity, and complexity, creating a vivid and immersive tapestry of human need, human weakness, and the inevitably of everything including death. Actually, Carla Jean's mom may be the only exception to that now that I think of it! But this story does no apologize to anyone for what it is - a window into the world we live in, where good people aren't rewarded for being good and bad people aren't punished for being bad. This is a film about people in a cruel world fulfilling their roles as part of something larger and less meaningful than their individual lives. And when the credits roll, we know the dust does not settle. Nobody has really changed, or been surprised or will even remember we were watching. And I love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Clean Dirty,"How can I be disappointed by a good movie?I suppose I should say at the outset that this IS a good movie. You should see it. Its all about the writing, though.McCarthy's writing style comes after the Clancy/Ludlum model where things are diced into parallel episodes but unified in a grand arc driven by the cosmic principle that good triumphs and the bad guys get punished. This has become the cinematic norm, so whenever we pass through a scene-story, we know how it fits in a universe powered by a machine of justice.McCarthy has the intelligence to open the world, introducing into his novels the notion of apparently unraveled justice. We do have episodes. We do cling to some of the traditional formula: drugs, mob boss, the hunted, the west, the champion of justice. Each of these is used conventionally. Its no accident that Tommy Lee was selected to play the part, because we assume he will be the hunter from Fugitive, the agent who adjusts things to their proper order. Its no accident that all the ordinary pieces of this are made from the same stuff we'd find in airport books and their coincident movies.But its also no accident that McCarthy's books draw on the cinematic revolution. His images assume that you can see, not imagine. That way he can do two novel things. One is that he can show by not showing, for instance Moss's actual death. This separation between the imagined and the shown also allows him to elevate the imagined into substance. This film, for instance, starts and ends with annotative stories. They aren't directly linked to the action we see, but they have agency, power and they come close enough to being parallel episodes that we accept them as relevant.The other cinematic notion that McCarthy uses is noir, and I am certain that it is what attracted the Coens. They've spent their entire careers surrounding this notion, probing it from all directions. In absolute terms, what defines noir is the notion that the machinery of the universe is arbitrary and linked to the act of viewing. That ""viewing"" piece has stickiness, because it involves us in what happens to the characters in the world we witness. McCarthy makes us explicitly complicit in the unraveling of ordinary, even expected justice.Its all wonderful. Its all perfectly comprehended and presented by the Coens. Its clean. It works. Its poetic and deserves to be near the top of anyone's list. If nothing else, the Coens know how to end a movie, probably the most elusive element of narrative skillcraft.So why am I unhappy?Because the Coens play a special role in my film life. They are the folks who play games, who explore, who tease and question. They are the Bob Dylans of film. When they create something it has all sorts of extra annotative froth in it, usually cinematic in nature. Its baroque introspection where they pile twisted ironies on top of dishonest self-reference. They are the master of woven layers, of meandering narrative stance. They break where breaks are needed and not expected. They write their own vision, and clearly have that vision first.Here, they start with someone else's vision already written. Here they stick to the clean, the bones not the coral. Here they deliver directness. Their ambiguity is direct, not tangled.Yes, I can celebrate what they've done here. And sure I can say that they did well. But isn't that what we have Ang Lee for? PT Andersen? Sean Penn? When the Coens simply rely on their competence, they steal from us the things that they uniquely can do: confabulate and confuse reality. Now that Woody is all but retired, we need them more than ever, Dude.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Thrilling conflict against nihilism,"This is probably the purest genre exercise to win Best Picture since The Silence of the Lambs. It's all tension, quietly assembled and ready to break out into violence at any moment. This is a masterful adaptation of Cormac McCarthy by Joel and Ethan Coen, finding the little slices of black, deadpan, and offbeat comedy here and there, but mostly this is a dead stare of a threat against the audience's nerves. Told precisely both from a screenplay point of view as well as visually, No Country for Old Men is the stillest rollercoaster that gets the heart pumping.A drug deal goes wrong in the hinterlands of the Texas border county of Terrell County in 1980. Upon the aftermath comes Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a welder everyman who finds two million dollars in cash along with a dying cartel member. His humanity overcomes him, and he returns to the site to give the dying man water hours later, getting found out and starting a chase for the money. On his tail is the psychopath Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who uses an air pressure cannister and a heavily silenced shotgun to bring death to anyone in his path, but only by chance. He has this tic of deciding to let people go based on the results of a coin toss. A step or two behind the whole mess is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who wants to help, wants to protect Llewelyn and his wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald), and simply does not understand the senseless violence breaking out around him.What is surprising about the film really is how still and quiet everything is. When Llewelyn comes across the aftermath of the bloodshed, the camera quietly pans as he walks through the results of the massacre, but the overall situation has this threat that we can't escape as audience members, and this is effectively how the film starts (it really starts with Chigurh murdering a sheriff's deputy coldly and violently, helping to create that sense of danger as well). There's very little overactive camera movement (when Llewelyn is running in the dark there's an accentuated camera shake that feels digitally enhanced), and it helps create this sense of unease in pretty much every scene. Whether we're looking at Llewelyn and Carla Jean sitting on the couch or Chigurh holding a shotgun to someone sitting opposite to him, the same, cool approach to visual storytelling is applied and it creates this sense of unease the violence could breakout at any moment.That's not to say that the film is uniformly tense. It's only mostly tense. The tension is broken up mainly by tiny parts with characters who show up for a scene or two, like the old lady who owns the small Del Rio hotel that Llewelyn holes up in with particular views on how many beds are appropriate for a man alone to have in his hotel room. These little interactions are peppered throughout, especially in the film's first half, and really do help alleviate the tension from time to time.However, the chase between Llewelyn and Chigurh simply will not stop until one of them is dead, and the grounded, quiet approach to the filmmaking around it makes every encounter in the latter half a matter of life or death as Chigurh kills those in his way, those who see him, and always getting closer to Llewelyn as he gets closer to the Mexican border and even crosses it. It's a cat and mouse game where Llewelyn gets a leg up only to lose it to Chigurh a little bit later, back and forth with moments around hiding the cash in a hotel or noting a shadow under a door. The stillness just gets to me as we're constantly waiting for violence to erupt.There's a late break in the tension with the introduction of Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), a fellow assassin sent by Chigurh's employer to clip his wings, having a couple of conversations here and there as he helps provide further context to Chigurh's propensity for violence. He's a breath in between larger set pieces, and the movie still doesn't relent.The film ends with violence, of course, but also providing Ed room to face his own mortality, having helped nothing along the way, and reflecting on how his father will be waiting for him in a mountain pass up ahead. There's a reflection on how violence has always been with us, perhaps on a bit of nostalgia for a time that never quite existed, and a concern that really, things might still be getting worse and what can one man do against that tide?So, it's a genre exercise that's almost painfully tense for very long stretches. It has moments of deeply black and offbeat comedy. It's got something on its mind that it conveys well. This is just great entertainment at the movies, and it's the kind of film the Academy wanted to award with Oscars through the 00s. This wasn't a terrible decade for that award, overall, it seems.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Minority Report on Majority Favorite,"No Country for Old Men was an engaging and interesting film, but I was not as taken with it as most seem to have been.Plot-wise, it is primarily a chase film. Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) having made off with found drug money flees; psycho-killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) chases him; Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) chases Anton; Carson Wells, (Woody Harrelson) in the employ of the money side of the drug deal, chases the money; drug dealers chase Llewellyn. Can Moss get away with the money? He concocts a devious scheme for hiding the cash, but is not clever enough to figure out soon enough how Anton can find him so easily. He is smart enough to know his wife will need protecting but then sends her to a place where she is certain to be found.Anton is a bad-hair boogie-man, in the mold of Jason, Freddie or Michael Meyers, maniacally intent on retrieving his money, determined to kill any who have wronged him or even to have gotten in his way, and willing to lay waste any unfortunate enough to be nearby. Doesn't he catch up with Llewellyn rather quicker than seems likely for anyone not blessed with symbolic DNA? Isn't it at least a little suspicious that he knows exactly what medication to take from the pharmacy, and is able to deliver exact dosages? And how about his reaction when faced with a compound fracture at the end? Grits his teeth, wraps the sucker up and walks off into the distance like any good boogie-man might. Yet he cloaks his actions under the guise of having ""a code."" This ""code"" seems to impress some of those around him. Carson Wells and the sheriff both refer to it. A code that allows a madman to kill based on a coin toss is crying out for a rewrite. That Anton takes sadistic pleasure in bullying those to whom he offers the coin only reinforces that he is a nut-job. Does fate take pleasure in our demise? Not likely. Adding personality to Anton makes him less a symbol and more of a monster. The scene in which Carla Jean refuses to play, insisting that Anton was responsible for his actions and was not merely an instrument of fate, reinforces this. (A switch from the book, by the way. She accepts and loses in the novel.) So is Anton a symbol for fate or just a crazy guy? Both maybe, but if so, that muddies the issues.McCarthy's an adherent to the ""Life's a bitch and then you die"" school, with a career-long focus on violence in human existence. He sees things getting progressively worse. The violence here is more mindless than in his prior work. The message comes across that things have changed for the worse within the last generation. That probably references the disrespect for authority that grew out of the 1960s, the growth in the drug trade that happened in the 1970s, and by implication the spectacular growth of private gun use. To see where he is going with this, I suggest reading his award winning The Road, an incredible book about a post-apocalyptic America.The Coens offer snippets of their very welcome humor. Llewellyn appearing at the border crossing in a bathrobe was wonderful as was the scene in which he appears in the same outfit at a clothing store and the clerk asks in a deadpan how the boots were working out. Woody Harrelson gets a few nice comedic lines as does Josh Brolin. While no one gets to say ""I think I'm gonna barf,"" there are enough small yucks to lighten the overall emotional load.Could either Llewellyn or Anton bleed as much as they had and not go into shock? I don't know, but it certainly was impressive seeing them self-medicate.I liked the cinematography, the beautiful opening serenity that would play host to the high body count to come, the claustrophobia of the hotels, some very nice in-town shots looking down at the streets and storefronts.Acting-wise, Josh Brolin was perfect as the everyman who sees his opportunity and takes it, then trying to cope with the results. I would have liked to have seen him get a nomination. TLJ played, well, TLJ. It seemed to me that this is the same role he has played in many, many films. Of course, I really like TLJ, so I do not know if this is a bad thing. Kelly McDonald (Carla Jean Moss) earned her money for her scene with Javier Bardem. Riveting. Harrelson was fun. But I do not get what all the excitement is for Bardem. Yes, he was effective in portraying a nut-job. Should Ah-nold have gotten an Oscar nomination for his homicidal robot? That was effective too. Bardem is arguably one of the brightest acting lights of our generation. Before Night Falls and The Sea Inside show his unmistakable genius. But the role as written is confusing. Is he a symbol or a person? The role does not really offer all that much range, in my humble opinion. Yes, he is scary. He uses silence effectively. And...So what are we to take from this movie? Life is ultra-violent and tough noogies? When your number is up, your number is up? Cormac needs to get out more. One need not go along with McCarthy's dark view of life to enjoy the film, and I did enjoy it quite a bit. I am a fan of the Coens. I love their sense of humor, particularly. But I do not believe that this film is their best work. Nor do I believe that it merits a best picture nomination. I know this puts me in a minority. It is an interesting film, dark yet amusing, and I would recommend it. But somehow it is not, to my mind, at the top tier.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I clearly don't get it,"I can't say I view this one positively. I clearly don't get it, which I'm fine with.I'm all for films that don't play it so straight that it's predictable, but at the same time I'm rarely a fan of films that are so full of themselves to end in such a derisory way. Listen, that's probably harsh as it is still a good flick no doubt, but 'No Country for Old Men' is highly unsatisfactory and highly uninspiring for me.I will say that I have no issues with the cast whatsoever, they are all fantastic. Javier Bardem is awesome, easily the star, and Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin and Woody Harrelson are all top value. Kelly Macdonald and Garret Dillahunt are also involved, I like them too. Stephen Root, Mr. 'L for Love' himself, as well. Away from the onscreen bunch, the cinematography is superb.It's the story. I didn't get what I wanted from it, at all. All the ingredients are there for a 10/10 film, that's the level I was expecting it to reach based on the opening half or so. The second half though... super disappointing! So many underwhelming choices. Such a waste of a strong cast... 'The Counselor'-esque. Bardem is also in that, sorry my dude!The fact I'm still giving this what I consider to be a positive rating shows how much the conclusion frustrated me. This had top tier written all over it but it somehow messed it up as it went by... and I'm not usually one to dig out a film's ending.In my defence, even some reviews (many, in fact) from people who love the film mention that the ending isn't perfect so I guess it just comes down to how the final moments sit with you. For me, evidently not good!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Offensively BAD,"I really really hate this film and I'm flabbergasted at the amount of alleged love for it. I still refuse to believe that some of these positive reviews here are legitimate. Still, maybe my expectations were skewed going in to it. I was expecting a ""Walking Tall"" meets ""Fargo"" movie, a quirky and intense tough guy crime drama that would leave me satisfied. This movie and especially its resolution are the least satisfying in recent memory.I've read the elitist argument about deeper themes and beautiful cinematography but without a story to pull it all together, who cares? To me, a movie is primarily about character and story. Even great performances and direction can't save a bad concept or story. This story is ugly on paper and it's despicable on screen. Some of the spoilers have been disgusted here so, there's no need to rehash them. Needless to say, killing characters may haunt and disturb the viewer but it's cheap emotion that normal movie goers will resent. The piecemeal dialogue is also off putting. Every exchange seems to be a poor parody tribute to Pulp Fiction style of dialog. Tommy Lee Jones' character being the worst ""witty"" offender.I guarantee you that word of mouth from average movie goers will be quite poor for this trash. The only good thing is that after, people will feel truly betrayed by the critical consensuses and praise for it. This will farther erode trust in opinions of the critics. Making critics even more useless is never a bad thing. When I see the TV commercials for Old Country and the quotes they use, I resent every word and every critic mentioned. After others waste time and effort with this movie, I won't be the only resentful one.Terrible, terrible movie.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Mans Misfortunes Always Leaves a Trail,"""No Country for Old Men"" has it all. It's a chase film, but it's also subdued with symbolism and subtly. The acting is top notch and everybody has heard of Javier Bardem' great performance, but I think the real standout comes from Josh Brolin- in a career year- as Llewelyn Moss. Tom Lee Jones gives a powerhouse performance in subtly which only fits the nature and the tone of the film. Kelly McDonald is fantastic as Llewelyn' wife. When those two share a scene we really get a great understanding of their relationship in just a few moments here and there. Woody Haralson will remind you why he's an actor with a very good performance as a bounty hunter.The film starts and ends with Tommy Lee Jones' character, Ed Tom Bell. He has been a Sheriff since he was 25 years old with a history of lawmen dating back to his grandfather. Late in his career and late in life Ed Tom struggles with his past, future and legacy. He always questions whether or not the old timers would be proud of him because he's not proud of himself. He feels as if the world is changing; the violence is changing; man is changing and he can't keep up anymore. He's being passed by, by the younger man much like his dream with his younger father. Ed Tom is slowing down and the people he's chasing are moving faster until they stop and start a fire. Only then does he catch up. Once he get's there he knows he'll face something he doesn't understand and he'll have to put his motto at risk: ""I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job. But, I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand."" The evil he chases is cunning, smart, dark, and almost invisible until the final moments where fate steps in and delivers what's coming.As Bell is the focus of the film, Anton Chigurh, is the driving force in the film. His evil is destructive, it's overwhelming, it's senseless, and it's the fate of a coin toss. Anton' evil is best shown in a gas station scene where he subtly threatens the life of a gas station proprietor. The dialogue in the scene is incredible and it's the Coen' at their best. After the gas station proprietor infuriates Chigurh, because of his stupid questions, Anton decides to let fate step in and settle the dispute in a coin toss. As he crinkles up a candy wrapper, and lets it go, it becomes out of the hands of Chigurh. Fate has stepped in and the coin that has been traveling for 22 years is now here and that will decide whether the man lives or dies. It's his call and its either heads or tails. Chigurh can't call it for him, but he is his fate since he and the coin arrived at the same time. Chigurh simply doesn't care what the result is, but there has to be a result. Another great scene which shows Chigurh' Grim Reaper like evil is where one man watches another man die right in front of him at the hands of Chigurh. The man absurdly asks; ""Are you going to kill me?"" and Chigurh turns around and looks right into his eyes with a grin on his face and responds with an absurd question of his own, ""Do you see me?"" Moss is a simple man. A Vietnam War veteran. A man with a determination to find a way out of the life he currently inhabits as greed and fortune take over his fate. He tries to run. He tries to get away and live happily ever after and he believes he will even after he is ""immobilized"" by a gun shot wound from Chigurh. Like any person, Moss follows mans evil on a hunting trip as he tracks down the blood trail of a wounded dog. He follows the trail back and finds a slaughtering and Mexican Drug deal gone horribly wrong. Moss finds a man in need of water and he tells him he ""ain't got no water."" He smartly figures out there has to be money somewhere and figures one man was left and ran off. So he searches out for the ""last man standing,"" leaving the other man dying of thirst. Moss comes to a shade tree and through his eyes we can see a figure next to the tree. He waits for movement, and then he walks to the tree and finds a dead man with a satchel full of money. His fate doesn't involve a coin toss, but rather a satchel full of money and a transponder. This will bring Chigurh to Moss.The films end will leave viewers dissatisfied because the final act of the film is quite different than the first two acts. The final act isn't shot in the vast, empty hot lands of western Texas, but in an urbanized environment in the city. This goes well with the change of Bell' character. The terrain is not his costume. It's not his country. The final act is fast paced unlike the first two. There are no horses. There are more than pistols- machine guns. The violence is no longer shown. It's shown through a spilt milk bowl or Chigurh checking his boots. The violence takes a backstage seat where the first two acts are loaded with violence pushing on excessive. As the film unravels like the candy wrapper, Bell's fate steps in. He goes back to the big crime scene. He sees and knows what's on the other side of that door. He knows he is putting his soul at hazard. He's pushing his chips to the middle of the table and he enters in the face of evil where fate takes over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Never gets old,"I could watch No Country for Old Men over and over and over again. It is that good. It is thrilling to watch every time, and so rich with meaning and precision that you learn something new each time. Javier Bardem is outstanding, and the story is so well crafted that you need to watch it a second time to really get it.The interesting thing about No Country is that there is almost no musical scoring. It makes you so razor focused that it's impossible to look away. The first time I watched this movie, I started it on Netflix late at night, thinking I would start it and then go to bed and finish it another time. I was wrong. My eyes were glued to the TV, so immersed in the film that I watched the whole thing in that one sitting.The Coen brothers are so awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Best Film of The Year!,"I have no idea why the preceding few reviews have been so derogatory towards this film which truly is incredible from every perspective. No Country For Old Men (N.C.F.O.M.) deservedly won it's 4 academy awards for Best Picture, Director(s), Adapted Screenplay and Supporting Actor. NCFOM is a gritty, dark, southern Gothic thriller adapted by the brilliant Coens from McCarthy's visceral novel. The Performances are superb throughout, Brolin, Jones, and Harrelson are great and Javier Bardem simply becomes the psychopathic Anton Chigurh who represents a relentless evil and in a way an amoral judge. People say that it's easy to play a psycho, well when one embodies a deranged mind so completely subtle nuances, idiosyncrasies and all then a praiseworthy performance results (remeber Hopkins' Lecter and Kathy Bates' Annie Wilkes). In essence what i'm saying is, you will never forget Bardem's role after watching this film. The Coens yet again manage to fill this grizzly story with their unique humour especially when Jones and Harrelson are on screen, delivering some great one-liners. What must be commended most of all is the brothers' directing, coupled with a stunning, sun-scorched cinematography of the Texas wasteland, every shot in the film is a work of art. Every frame seems to be utterly planned out with amazing composition and style, hats off! I only wrote this review because i went to see this film 3 times in the cinema in one week, which is a first for me, and i could not stand to have people giving ridiculous scores of 1/10 to this masterpiece, simply because they did not absorb anything it has to offer (and it has plenty!) So 10/10 to the best picture of the year!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good not Great,"I've seen this film twice now and although I enjoyed and appreciated it the first time around, I was less forgiving about it after a second viewing. I personally think the Coen Brothers are brilliant filmmakers but No Country just doesn't work for me. First thing that bugs me is the folly of the films supposed primary theme; chance. Seriously, all the coin flipping is so blatant and un-subtle that surely it can't be what the film is about, can it? I've always found the Coen's work to be very refined, so to be bashed over the head with something so clichéd as a-man-flipping-a-coin-to-represent-chance just doesn't seem quite right for me.Obviously, No Country isn't a bad film. Technically it's brilliant, in terms of cinematography; shot selection, lighting and framing everything on screen is impeccably done. Also, the acting is superb; Bardem's Chigurh is instantly iconic. Brolin's LIewelyn (surely a name that should be used more in movies) is strong but vulnerable, unapologetically simple, yet layered. Equally, Tommy Lee Jones's Ed Tom is an interesting and enigmatic character. However therein is one of the main problems I have with this film; the Ed Tom story thread just doesn't fit in this film; thematically and tonally it's at odds with the main story and all it does is succeed in giving the film a bloated feel. For me, it's a case of a good performance that has been added to the detriment of the rest of the film.So what is No Country For Old Men about? It can't be about chance as that is too obvious. It can't be about getting old because it has so little to say. Is it about the insignificance of man off-set against the indeterminably powerful presence of nature and the relentless passage of time? Perhaps, but the Coen's have never been complex and pretentious just for the sake of being complex and pretentious.I can appreciate the fact that No Country is a good film, well made with some great composite elements. However I don't feel it has the vibrancy of O Brother, Where Art Thou?, or the humour of Fargo, or the intelligence of Barton Fink. For me, this film is an un-satisfying mix of art house film-making and mainstream marketing, which benefits from great performances and an interesting central story but is damaged by poor choices in terms of muddled themes, sound design and the inclusion of an unnecessary sub-plot in what otherwise would have been a brilliant film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best Coen Film since Fargo,"I saw this movie already at a select theater in San Antonio, home of Tommy Lee Jones.As soon as the film opens I was transported to the Fargo landscape but in hot steamy Texas town, once the Fargoesque feeling disappeared the film was completely unique.The characters are unique and familiar at the same time. I lived in west Texas and Traveled New Mexico extensively so I was able to spot NM location quickly, even then the camera work and acting had me convinced I was in Texas throughout.I found myself confused when the film blurred the lines of the characters, as Tommy Lee Jones and his character play a tired, regretful sheriff who realizes his sins are catching up to him, and the villain played by Javier Bardem who is ever so cold and calculated but has impeccable ethics and is anything but dishonest. You are sure to enjoy this wild ride and find yourself engrossed by the well developed characters and realistic action and typical Coen suspense and story telling.Watch this film not once but two or three times. I plan to watch it again soon and I am sure I will enjoy it even more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Guess who's back?,"It must be hard being a Coen brother: knowing that no mater what you do it'll no doubt be compared to something from your ingenious, genre spanning filmography; Blood Simple, Miller's Crossing, Fargo, The Big Lebowski, O' Brother Where art Thou- the list goes on. That's no excuse for knocking-out out back-to-back let-downs that don't compare to Jaws 4, though. Alright, alright, that's a little harsh. Joel and Ethan's last 2 collaborations (Intollerable Cruelty, The Ladykillers) weren't that bad but they were found wanting in every trait and department we'd come to expect from the brothers grim: atmospheric set-ups, sublime photography, onion-like plots, cult characters, quirky humour, dark and light topics- inspired commitments to celluloid with a real sense of time and place. So what about No Country for Old Men? The Coens' perilously grave adaptation of Cormac Macarthy's acclaimed 2005 novel. Well, it doesn't so much signal a return to form as it does shove a cattle gun in your face while screaming ""GUESS WHO'S BACK AND GUNNING FOR Oscars!?""Opening with an eerie and muted montage redolent of their first film Blood Simple, The Coens' loyal spin on Macarthy's western thriller is a slow-boiling affair that unfolds in and around the Tex-Mex border. It's 1980 and after stumbling across a drug-deal gone wrong, cunning 'nam vet Lleyweln Moss (Josh Brolin) makes off with a case full-of cash and changes his life forever. But not in a good way. Apparently the money belonged to an imposing and methodical, almost ghost like killer called Anton Chigurgh (Javier Bardem) who's either Death incarnate or Satan himself. Who or whatever he is, the Devil's advocate wants his money back and absolutely will not stop until he gets to Moss. Enter Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee-Jones), a nostalgic old-timer who's haunted by the mind of the modern-day criminal but will do whatever he can to stop ""the dismal tide"" and get to Moss before Chigurgh.As the bodies pile up and the plot thickens, it becomes clear that No Country for Old Men is much more than a bloody game of cat and mouse with shot guns. It is a taut and chilling meditation on contemporary crime and criminality that bitterly chews on the themes of money, morality, youth, age, fate, faith, evil and society. And it's absolutely majestic. A meticulous and suspenseful fusion of cinematic art and high- quality entertainment with layers and substance in spades. The Coens even have the nerve to pepper their morbid principle-play with bouts of jet black humour. Hell, they even toss-in an abrupt ending. The brilliant bastards.No Country for Old Men is their most profound and important film to date. Better than Fargo. Better than Miller's Crossing. It could well be their masterpiece. A bold claim, yes, but everything just seems to come together; the look, the score, the feel, the acting: Brolin, Bardem and Tommy Lee-Jones are all excellent. Former two giving stellar, break- through turns that'll kick-down doors for their careers. Brolin is bang- on as the dry and driven Moss and Bardem's forbidding portrayal of the mop-top hunter Chigurgh is nothing short of memorable. Woody Harleson's even in there with a guardian angel-like side character but it's Lee- Jones turn as the overwhelmed Sheriff that proves to be the most important and pertinent of the pack. His opening monologue and insights into what's unfolding speak not just for the Coens' 1980's based thriller but for today's world. ""A crime's so harsh these days it's hard to even take its measure"" Not only does Bell represent a cleaner, pre- drug generation but also the conscience of the film. He's more of a hamstrung bystander than the cop charged with bringing an end to the evil and bloodletting. His sombre and reflective words of thought and fear book end the film in some style and leave plenty of room for interpretation. ""When I got older I always thought that God would sorta come into my life. He didn't"".Through their encyclopedic knowledge and love of film along with the exemplary photography of Roger Deakins, Joel and Ethan are able to extract the prose right from the pages of Macarthy's lucid parable and paint the screen with them. The Coens' do a little more than justice to the book. No Country for Old Men is a monumental piece of American film that could clean-up at this year's Oscars. And that's saying something when you consider the competition in The Assassination of Jesse James.. and There Will be Blood. My god, what a golden period for US cinema. This awesome Coen comeback is deserving of the best director(s) gong at the least. Joel and Ethan have set the bar for 2008 with an instant- classic. Miss this at your peril.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A Brilliant,Flawless Masterpiece From The Coen Brothers And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made.","No Country For Old Men is a flawless masterpiece of cinema that combines amazing acting,great direction,a wonderful screenplay and memorable characters. This is one of the Coen Brothers best films,one of my all-time favorite films and one of the greatest films ever made.Based on Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name and set in West Texas in 1980,No Country For Old Men tells the story of a hunter named Lleweyln Moss(Josh Brolin)who comes across a drug deal gone bad and finds two million dollars in a briefcase. Even though he has the money,Lleweyln knows he's not safe and has to find a way out while being tracked by a dangerous hit-man named Anton Chigurh(Jarvier Bardem),local county sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones)and Mexican drug dealers all leading up to a violent and bloody chase and cat and mouse game.NCFOM is a masterpiece that works not just as Crime Thriller,but,also works as a Coen Brothers film,character study,the study on the themes of life,death and fate and as a Contemporary Western. What I love about NCFOM is that while it is a Coen Brothers film,at times it doesn't feel like one because of the way the Coens approach the story. Unlike most of the Coens films,where violence and chaos are done with loud sounds and a music score,this film has a very quiet and somber demeanor,giving us a world of the Texas landscape where violence and chaos is almost silent and unheard and where no character is safe. The Action and Violence in the film are well-done with suspense and intensity and the fact that there is no music during the Action scenes adds to the film's greatness and puts you on the edge of your seat. The Action and violence in the film is bloody and dark and will disturb you to the core. The screenplay by The Coens is excellent,adapting McCarthy's dialog word for word right out of the book,with The Coens still bringing some of their signature style and sense of humor and wit to the script. The movie is a great character study as well,with the three main character Ed Tom,Anton and Llewelyn in the forefront. The three main characters are well-developed and memorable,each of them having great scenes on their own and as the film goes on you understand their motivations,who they are and who they're about,whether it's Llewelyn and the money,Anton Chigurh and his pursuit of the money and Ed Tom reactions to the things he sees all around him. What sets NCFOM from other crime Thrillers is the film's study of Life,death and fate. Life,death and fate seem to either effect or goes with the characters,with Anton Chigurh who is basically a physical representation of death and fate. Chigurh strongly believes in fate and uses a coin to find out whether you die or not,if you guess heads or tails,one or the other right,you live,if you don't you will die at the hands of Chigurh. The gas station scene in the film will show you. Where Llewelyn is trying to defend himself from violence and death,Sheriff Ed Tom just doesn't understand why there's violence all around and why the times are changing all around him,with drugs,guns and death in the air. Ed Tom represents the past where old time sheriff's didn't have to use a gun or deal with violence,the future in this film is drugs,guns,death and the real danger and Horror of violence,something that Ed Tom Bell doesn't understand and can't figure out why it's happening and there is a sadness and dread that hangs over the film with Ed Tom and the title No Country For Old Men refers to him. NCFOM is also a modern Western in many respects and while we don't see any stagecoaches and six-shooters,you will see characters riding horses and wearing cowboy hats and Roger Deakins beautiful photography shows viewers the dust and dirt of West Texas making look beautiful and nice during the day while making the film dark and eerie at night. The ending of the film will divide viewers and will fall into two categories people who love the ending or who will hate the ending,I fall into the former category because the Coens while staying true to their vision,also stay true to the vision of McCarthy's novel offering viewers a powerful and unforgettable conclusion that doesn't end with a bang,but with a whimper and one of the reasons NCFOM is a Masterpiece.The whole cast is excellent in their roles. Josh Brolin is does a great job as Llewelyn Moss bringing a grit and toughness to the role. Jarvier Bardem is brilliant as Anton Chigurh,one of the best villains in movie history. Bardem is frightening,scary and menacing and doesn't try to be scary,he just is. Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell,bringing a quiet,somber and sometimes dry humor to the performance. Woody Harrelson does good job as Carson Wells,an associate of Anton Chigurh. Kelly Macdonald does a fine job as Llewelyn's wife Carla Jean Moss and considering Macdonald's Scottish in real life does a good job with the Texas accent. Garret Dillahunt(Wendell),Tess Harper(Loretta Bell),Barry Corbin(Ellis),Stephen Root(Man who hires Wells)and Beth Grant(Carla Jean's Mother)give fine performances as well.The Coen Brothers(Joel and Ethan)direction in the film is excellent and the Coens give the film great pace and timing,while giving film a great since of atmosphere and tone,always moving the camera. Brilliant direction Joel and Ethan.The score by Carter Burwell is rarely heard in the film,but when in use is effective and fits with the mood of the film. Fine score.In final word,if you love Crime Thrillers,Drama,character study's,Western,The Coen Brothers,Cormac McCarthy or cinema,I suggest you see No Country For Old Men,an absolute Masterpiece of cinema that you can watch again and again and is one of The Coen Brothers Best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.j",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You can't stop what's coming.,"West Texas is a perfect setting for a movie like this -- no trees, just desolate land for miles around. The chicken farmer (Richard Jackson) was from Alpine -a place in the middle of nowhere with a long long stretch of road that literally - I kid you not - has turkey buzzards on the fence posts along the way. Annie Proulx (Brokeback Mountain) described it perfectly in her 2002 book, ""That Old Ace in the Hole."" I've been gone from there for five years, but it hadn't changed much from the 1980 setting in the film, an I suspect it hasn't changed much more.Llewelyn Moss, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin (Grindhouse, Hollow Man) thought he hit the jackpot. But, he didn't account for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Chigurh was methodical, intelligent and psychotic. He is the human equivalent of the terminator robot after John Conner. Those who believe in souls would not say that Chigurg has one.Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, U.S. Marshals) is a tired sheriff that comes from a long line of lawmen. He knows that he is no match for Chigurg. It's not Richard Kimble or Mark Sheridan he's chasing, but a man who has no match.The dialog is dry and things are not always explained. There is constant tension knowing what may lie on the other side of the door.Jones' buddy Ellis had it down: Whatcha got ain't nothing new.

Now hold on a minute....lets use a little common sense here,"this is the first review i read after returning from a movie that left everyone in the audience completely mystified and scratching their heads in amazement..: ""DO NOT LISTEN TO THE IGNORANT PEOPLE GIVING THIS BAD REVIEWS!!!! They are the people that go to a movie just wanting to see Vin Diesel blow things up, or see Ice Cube babysit. Heaven forbid a movie without a happy ending, one that makes you think about characters and theme....etc,etc"" ......in short, the individual who wrote the review i just quoted is clearly reviewing it from a bizarrely different perspective that does NOT address storytelling basics; i mean, HOW,...HOW on this planet does someone come out of that movie talking like this:........""Such a complex film requires deep thinking. While the plot itself isn't too complicated, the characters are multi-dimensional, and the themes are subtle, in a way that some people may not understand."" I don't think there is anyone reading this review (of mine) that is going to want to continue reading an unending rant and rave (and i don't wanna write it) so,i am going to get straight to the point. The movie DID have some terrific moments,but when you string a series of moments together for 2 hours and the storyline does not offer up some basic sets of logic (like a more impressive law enforcement effort after a cop is killed) you come to expect in our age of senseless violence, there is still an audience, sitting there (no matter how smart or stupid they are),waiting for some small semblance of ""cohesion"" in a story...to give a hint that the people IN the story are not soooooooooo far disconnected with all of the things in the world that the audience sees in their everyday life. the bottom line is that this movie has so much stubborn incoherence and ""detraction"" from any sense of conclusion or closure on many parts of it that there is an inevitable deep sense of storytelling betrayal that has absolutely nothing to do with the argument that it should be recognized for ""a complex film requiring deep thinking""...i mean..........seriously; the movie is just........not.......very ...........good. period. no complex thinking is needed to be able to point out that simple,clear fact. So,when you get past all of your graduate level film courses and analytical techniques, you still have to figure out if a film can rise to the level of storytelling that is capable of doing more than lead a complete roomfull of people to an ""oh, my God,what the hell was that"" final reaction.thx...Scott",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Gripping thriller about human nature,"A simple chase story with a modern Western vibe, brought alive by compelling characters brilliantly acted throughout. The core of the film to me was the simple portrayal of the humanity (good and ill) of the many characters, in sharp contrast to the interesting but chilling psychopath antagonist. Attention is paid to all the characters, even minor roles, and the subtle but very true portrayal of different facets of human nature - which is what really carries the movie. The action sequences are superbly done - chilling and blood soaked - and well timed, and the tension and pace is just right throughout. The ending, perhaps, is a bit sudden.

This is a Javier Bardem super show,"This movie displays a methodical but also spontaneous psychopath played flawlessly by Javier bardem. For me, this movie has small crumbs of humor to pick up, but it's a very dark and powerful story about a man fulfilling an intense journey.

"Your call, friendo.","Movies that stimulate plenty of discussion about whether they are good or bad or awful are probably movies that should be seen more than once. I had that feeling after seeing films like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' Not much really happens in those movies and they have a lengthy runtime. Kubrick's film has 88 minutes of no dialog. That's like making a feature length film and not having any spoken dialog, and by today's standards (even 1968 standards) that is odd. The Coen Brothers' latest film has that quality to it. Not a whole lot happens for large parts of the film.The fact of the matter is that not a whole SEEMS to happen. Take one of the opening scenes as Llewelyn sees the man sitting underneath the tree. He looks at him, nothing. He looks again, nothing. He moves in closer, rifle trained, nothing. He sees the man has bled. The bag next to the dead body has money, a lot of money. So he takes it. Aesthtically, not much happens as Llewelyn just warily approaches the tree. Mentally, however, is where the action is. Llewelyn is part afraid, part curious, but being cautious enough to keep his wits and try not to get killed. Obviously from the previous scene we see that the money in question is a hot item and a good deal of people died for it.In today's special effects drenched age people seem to have completely forgotten what real tension and suspense is. It is not a huge wall of fire (a la 'Independence Day') coming at you, but what is going through your head when you see that wall of fire coming. With this film, the Coens have put the tension in an intentionally bare landscape in order to show as little aesthetic flair as possible. This amplifies the psychological impact and suspense as there seems to be nowhere for Llewelyn to hide from a killer who also seems to appear from nowhere. Call it a MacGuffin technique or whatever floats your boat.The film is also highly more symbolic than the typical movie of today. Many things are implied, not actually shown. Much of the dialog and situations are allegorical (or applicable) to things much more general than a search for dirty money. Thus, this isn't a film solely for entertainment, which is what people want today (many people, not all). This is a film that first and foremost attempts to stimulate thought like '2001' and 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.' The abundant discussion here about whether it was good or bad or boring or pointless pretty much seems to confirm just that. People are talking about it. Whether it is out of frustration of praise is almost incidental, since it only confirms that the Coens achieved their goal. Maybe soon we'll see a director(s) make an actual film in response to this one. That is what living art is all about - it acts and reacts, just like its characters. --- 9/10Rated R for violence.

Masterpiece?,"Coed Brothers. A dark thriller about a bag of money. An exchange by the drug dealers, all deceased in a gun battle. The man who steals the money. And the guy who's trained to do anything to find him. And the cop on pursuit.It's that kinda movie.This movie has such a subtle hard punch in the face that you don't see it coming.

Javier Bardem, an excellent Spanish actor who plays real roles in Spanish movies, is once again cast as an over-the-top maniac (as in 'Dance with the Devil'.)

Unconventional but highly effective thriller,"This movie took a while to really get into, but once I did I was pretty overwhelmed. It isn't a classic fight between the good and the bad, it's more like a brilliant cat-and-mouse game between the unlikeable and the even more unlikeable. I felt bad for Llewellyn Moss, who had no idea about how far over his head he was, but he's mostly the hero because of the contrast with Anton Chigurh. Chigurh is the unstoppable evil, which is mainly apparent in the gas station scene, in which he decides the clerk's fate in a coin toss. It's so random, it has nothing to do with the main plot, but he wants to kill him because he can. That's the frightening thing about Chigurh, he does bad things for no reason. It's a brilliant character, and his cold-blooded antics give the movie a breakneck pace. The pseudo-intellectual ending scene is an anti-climax, but that's pretty much the only criticism I can give.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I think girls won't find it interesting that much. It's more like a guys territory. Boys enjoy it. Plenty of cool chase scenes and some awesome action ones which has a touch of Coen' power in it.The trio is fantastic. Javier Bardem, in his own words, is out of his comfort zone, but he delivers.

Wonderful!,"I decided to read Cormac McCarthys book before watching this movie adaptation, having been a big fan of his more recent novel The Road. I loved the book and ended up uncertain if I wanted to watch the movie as I it was hard to imagine the Coen brothers being able to do it justice. Overall though, I was impressed with their treatment of the story, both in following the text closely and in terms of playing out the author's intentions rather than undermining or erasing them.Having said that, there are some real differences between the two which to me meant the film didn't quite deliver on the story in the way the book did. Most of these differences probably came from a need to keep the running time down, but personally I would have been happy for the movie to be an hour longer and to follow more of the subplots of the book. The most important of those differences for me:â¢ In the book Carla Jean calls the coin toss incorrectly and Chigurh shoots her. They have pretty much the same conversation in both versions, but in the Coens version she refuses to call the toss forcing Chigurh to see it is he, not the coin, deciding her fate.â¢ The book explains why we meet Chigurh in jail, saying he permitted himself to be captured ""to see if I could extricate myself by an act of will"". Later Chigurh describes this as a vain, foolish act. These facts are not in the movie.â¢ The first hotel confrontation between Moss and Chigurh is altered in the movie; rather than punching out the lock and wounding Moss, Chigurh takes a key from the murdered receptionist and enters Moss' room, where a hiding Moss takes him captive at gunpoint, so they have a chance to see and know each other. Then Moss runs and the shootout begins.â¢ In the book Chigurh delivers the recovered cash to a man he's never met before, and a conversation ensues. In the film it is fairly unclear who Chigurh works for, which makes his character hard to understand.â¢ Where the film last sees Moss alive heading off to have a beer with a lady who calls to him from poolside at her hotel, the book has a whole subplot between him and a young female hitchhiker, to whom he gives money and advice. He actually dies because he puts down his gun when the Mexicans following him take her hostage. This was a big part of the development of the Moss character in the book, with it being clear that Moss was loyal to his wife and would not take advantage of the teenager even when propositioned, and afterwards the hanging question of what his wife would think when he was found dead in a motel with a teenage runaway.Anyway, book versus film aside, this movie features some truly brilliant performances, and is an astounding achievement in storytelling and filmmaking.

"""I laugh myself sometimes. Ain't much else I can do.""","A+The Coen Brothers have definitely caught my eye. I know they have an impressive career, but this film is my favorite of theirs. It has the cinematography and location of a great modern Western, the lighting of a film noir, and the great dialogue of a Coen Brother film. The difference though is that ""Fargo"" (another Coen brother favorite of mine) is a dark comedy-drama, and this film, as the Coen Brothers put it, is about the unstoppable evil"". Playing that evil is Javier Bardem as Anton Chigur, and he's one of the best movie villains I've ever seen. The theme of the movie, as in the book it is based on, is the decadence of our country. Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones are subject to this. Those expecting a traditional morality tale, the triumph of good over evil, will not find it here.I find that the majority of the viewers say that they love the build-up of the movie, the pacing being perfect, the action great, and the drama well-written. What they often say they can't stand is the ending. Without spoiling the climax, I can understand where they're coming from, but I have to disagree. Anybody who watched ""Fargo"" for the first time surely didn't expect the brand of comedy the film dwelled on. In the same light, viewers of ""No Country for Old Men' should expect the usual guidelines to go right out the window. As a true film lover, the ending, no matter how against your wishes it maybe, try to keep this in mind: the filmmakers are attempting something different, something bold. I learned this lesson the hard way some time ago when I first viewed ""Arlington Road"".Also, kudos to Kelly Macdonald, who did an extremely well done job, and I love Woody Harrelson no matter the film. And despite all the film's seriousness, it does have a touch of comedy with the MacDonald character's mother, played well by Beth Grant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Hidden loot, running far","No Country for Old Men is a grandiose, dark, violent Neo-Western thriller from the Coen Brothers.Adapted from a novel by Cormac McCarthy, it stars Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin. Brolin plays an ordinary Joe who whilst out hunting finds a fortune in the aftermath of a drug deal that went bad.This leads to a cat and mouse game involving three men. Brolin who has to evade the relentless hit-man with a bad haircut played by Bardem.He also has to steer clear of Lee Jones, the violence weary veteran sheriff on the hunt for both men knowing that Brolin has bitten off more than he can chew and is in danger.The film is set in Texas of 1980 with a bleak, desert landscape. It is important to note the year, it means Brolin's character is a Vietnam war veteran and the film deals with the purported rise of modern urban violence from the 1970s onwards.McCarty's novel and its adaptation deals with themes of fatalism, conscience and circumstance. The Coen Brothers have dealt with various types of crime genres before in their film careers ranging from Blood Simple, Crimewave, Fargo and Miller's Crossing.In those films there have also been some form of humour even the the dark kind. Here they can pull the themes together in a grander scale as they have the source material that richly delivers. There is much less humour. A journey to bleakness lies for a lot of the participants.It is a combination of a modern western and an urban thriller. Even its 1980s setting with its fashion and style can easily merge with the present day with the presence of four wheel drive vehicles, high rise buildings and automatic weapons.The violence displayed is an important part of the film but some viewers may find this with the grim tone too much for them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Coen Brothers are back,"The best Coen movie since Fargo! Javier Bardem gives a terrifying performance as Anton Chigurh. From the opening scene we are introduced to this morbid character who has the coolest weapon I have seen for a villain in any movie. There is a lot of silence in the film which adds to the tension and thrills. The dialogue is excellent and philosophical at times. Tommy Lee Jones narration is great as he realizes no matter how hard he tries he cant change the evil in the world after he had maintained order as a sheriff in his small and quiet town in west Texas. The movie begins and ends with Jones narration. In the opening narrative he tells the story of a boy he sent to the electric chair who had killed his 14 year old girlfriend for no apparent reason. This narration sets the tone for the entire movie as we are introduced to Anton, a evil man who kills without hessitation. The abrupt ending has a lot to do with what Jones has been saying since the beginning of the movie. His final narration deals with the issue of the impossibility of understanding these evil characters and feels all he has done has been in vain. Great film which lives up to its predecessor, Fargo. Well deserved win for best picture of the year!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Yet another brilliant Movie from Coen Brothers,"'No Country for Old Men' is a grim and unsettling film that curiously makes its viewer beg for more of the same. In adapting Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel, sibling writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen, the team behind 'Fargo' and 'O Brother Where Art Thou?,' keep their quirky humor in check and stare unflinchingly at the worst humanity has to offer. As a result, the duo may have created their most accomplished and compelling movie to date.The Coens have always penned lively dialogue (""We felt the institution no longer had anything to offer us,"" says John Goodman, justifying his prison break in ""Raising Arizona"") and demonstrated visual panache (the wood chipper scene in ""Fargo"" is hard to forget).But the characters in ""No Country for Old Men,"" despite being larger than life, seem more real and believable. It's much easier to get worked up over their outcomes than wondering how the broad characters in ""Intolerable Cruelty"" might fare.It also doesn't hurt that the new film is loaded with several first-rate performers who can make potentially outlandish situations seem real. Tommy Lee Jones stars as Ed Tom Bell, a grizzled, third-generation lawman who has stumbled upon a grizzly case that makes anything he's handled before seem tame.An antelope hunter named Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers the aftermath of a drug deal that turned into a massacre. The only survivor of the class is a mortally-wounded man who's only able to beg for water, which Llewellyn doesn't have.In what seems like a major stroke of luck, he discovers a case of money that no one at the site of the debacle has lived to collect. He takes it home to his trailer park, bewildering his wife (Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald).The seemingly untraceable fortune actually has several people eager to claim it. A flashy hired gun named Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) has the dual task of retrieving the money and finding another fellow who's after it.Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem, obliterating his Spanish accent) may have been hired initially to find the cash, but he quickly leaves a trail of blood as long as the Nile. With his drooping bangs, Chigurh looks almost comical from a distance. His cold, brown eyes, however, betray how dangerous he can be. He murders anyone who gets in his way. And he often seems to dispatch people simply for pleasure.He's also as inventive as he is arbitrarily cruel. He can turn air tanks into a both a weapon and a door opener. Think of his as a Satanic McGuyver. Barden also projects the right blend of menace and buffoonery that makes each of Chigurh's attacks seem appropriately shocking.As Chigurh's quarry, Brolin is appropriately compelling. He may have been dumb to get himself in his current predicament, but he's resourceful enough to survive longer than anyone else who crosses Chigurh's path. Brolin has a likable sad sack quality to makes you wish he could get out of his grim situation.Following all of the sordid events is Jones' Earl Tom. The sheriff can read a crime scene with astonish accuracy, but correctly worries that it will take a Herculean effort to prevent a greater bloodbath. Jones demonstrates a fascinating vulnerability that belies his tough guy image and manages to make a character who functions primarily as a narrator engaging on his own terms.In addition to three terrific lead performances, the Coens manage to deliver some of their usual wordplay. When asked how dangerous Chigurh is, Wells simply replies, ""Compared to what? The bubonic plague?"" And thanks to McCarthy's plot line, they also have some genuinely surprising plot twists. The film constantly throws off a viewer's expectations.""No Country for Old Men"" is sometimes a difficult film to watch because it's unflinchingly grim and often leaves viewers to reach their own decisions about what happened.But the film lingers in the brain long after the credits start rolling and proves the Coen's can examine the frailty of the human heart as skillfully as they can manipulate words and images.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Everything about this movie is brilliant,"No Country for Old Men (2007) is a movie that is in my DVD collection and I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The first time I saw this was actually at an advanced screening with Josh Brolin in Georgetown. The storyline follows a simple man out hunting one day in Texas when he comes across some murdered men at the boarder and a truck full of cash. He takes the cash but is quickly tracked by a ruthless man with a unique form of killing whom wants his money. Meanwhile a sheriff ready to retire is on the tracks of the killer, but can he find him before he catches the man with the money?This movie is directed by the Coen Brothers (Raising Arizona) and stars Tommy Lee Jones (Men in Black), Josh Brolin (W), Woody Harrelson (CHEERS), Javier Bardem (Skyfall), Kelly Macdonald (Boardwalk Empire), Beth Grant (Donnie Darko) and Stephen Root (Office Space).Everything about this movie is brilliant. The storyline, characters, kills, dialogue and circumstances are so unique and intriguing. The cast delivers an awesome performance, especially Bardem, Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. I always find myself rooting for all three characters. Every scene feels authentic and believable despite every sequence being unpredictable. The settings and pace of the movie is perfect and I adore the metaphors throughout the movie. The narration is also very good and sets the mood for the film. The ending is sad and rewarding at the same time.Overall, everything about this movie is brilliant. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A Giant Leap from ""Fargo"" to Kierkegaard, Sartre and Camus","The title comes from the opening line of W. B. Yeats' famous poem ""Sailing to Byzantium,"" in which the aging narrator wishes to exchange his hard life in Ireland (""no country for old men"") for an imaginary aesthetic existence in ancient Byzantium. But neither the novelist (Cormac McCarthy) nor the Coen brothers are promising any sort of deliverance through art or any other imagined alternative to mortal existence. This isn't a story for elitist intellectuals and interpreters of Yeats' frequently arcane visions. On the other hand, it's not a story for those those film-goers who insist on a traditional ""movie bad guy"" and simply cannot, or refuse to, see the universal and very personal meanings represented by the characters, all of whom--from Barden's unstoppable killer to Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff--mirror our deepest desires, fears, and insecurities. Although not a movie serving up the escape and closure expected by traditional theater audiences, it nevertheless has the power to grip and engage the viewer like few other films. And like a Flannery O'Connor short story, its dark humor and violence ultimately lodge in personal consciousness (I frankly was hanging on to my seat with white knuckles to the very end, before leaving the theater ""sadder but wiser"" for the experience).The story is the Coen brothers' ""bait"" to get the viewer to think about non-trivial matters. After all, it's only we humans who are blessed with ""self-consciousness""-- with the capacity to think about our individual ""identities,"" and even about our own life and death. The key to putting together all that the spectator has experienced comes with the appearance of Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff in the final scene of the movie. He says that he's quitting as sheriff. He had expected ""God to somehow come into his life"" but is now too fully aware that God (much less he himself) is over-matched. The film's nemesis is a merciless ""executioner"" with less conscience than The Terminator and sufficient inscrutability to make even Woody Harrelson's perceptive diagnosis of him (as a psychopathic killer with principles, albeit devoid of ""morality"") inadequate. We, like the sheriff, are now faced with the inescapability of our own mortality and with re-visioning our past life in light of this disturbing reality.Josh Brolin appears to be the sympathetic ""hero."" he has a John Wayne-like rugged individualism, a knack for survival, and commands instant respect from those around him once they learn of his service in ""Nam""--but that won't cut it in the relentless, fatalistic, chancy determinism that, in the Coen Brothers' view of modern existence, controls our lives. Brolin's conscience requires him to return to the scene of a crime with water for the survivor of a drug deal gone terribly bad, yet he can dismiss his wife's concerns for her mother and he can be distracted by a female sunbather.Brolin's wife suddenly becomes a central figure, but only briefly. She at least has no illusions about getting a lucky roll of the dice. Her fate, like that of all mortals, is preordained, and she refuses to play the Executioner's coin-flip game, representing mortality more accurately: ""It's not me or the coin that decides what happens to me. It's you."" But in this circular question about free will and the meaning of life, Bardem answers her back: ""You're wrong. That's how I got here."" It's a game of chance, and there isn't even an authentic card dealer. But its through Bardem's mysterious (and deadly) character that the movie destroys all of our illusions and ultimately goes after the worst of the deadly sins--pride, hubris, taking upon ourselves what belongs only to God. When will we learn? Why can't we?And therein lies the film's admission of Aristotle's ""fatal flaw"" and along with it a small ray of light. Human agency has a role after all. Brolin did make a mistake and had the arrogance to think he could get away with his theft of the drug money intended for someone else. And for a moment, he let carnal desire distract him from the real threat. Moreover, he took his own life more seriously than that of his wife or mother- in-law, selfishly assuming that the Executioner was interested ""only"" in him.The last two scenes practically ""require"" interpretation. The Executioner (vulnerable himself, but a better survivor than Harrelson or Brolin) walks away. Behind him he leaves the seeds of greed (and of fatal pride) in a young boy who took money in exchange for what began as a Good Samaritan act. The recovered Executioner now ambles off into a typical American neighborhood (like that in David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet""). What's next on his agenda? The viewer can only speculate, even as the film cuts to Jones' sheriff relating a dream about meeting his father (who did not die an old man), and then says: ""I woke up.""That awakening is what this movie is all about. The screen goes black waiting for the spectator's inner light to come on. It's time to wake up--perhaps now more than ever. There may be a future, but there will be no lottery tickets--even to those who win them. It's we who must act to make the best of that mortally-defined fateful span of existence that lies before us. We can't know if our efforts will bear positive fruit, but we can know that ""good"" isn't simply going to happen by wishing and waiting for it. And we can also know that our prideful moments can only bring more misery. And if we don't know this now, the storyteller seems to be saying, we most certainly will when we're older.Finally, the film's setting must be taken seriously. It repeatedly points to a vacuum, a void, a land laid waste by the same human beings it once nurtured and empowered. Everyone wants answers. We have the power to find them, but only if we're not too complacent or proud to search for them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"No Country for Old Men, Coen's best?","Cormac McCarthy's national bestseller help the coen brothers make their first and finest adaption. No Country For Old Men, the bloodiest hell ride that shows the horror of the notorious psychopath kilter, named Anton Chigurh.This madman soon chases this guy named Llewellyn Moss, a Vietnam veteran who finds a truckload of Mexican brown dope and a case filled with ten million dollars in cash, with dead bodies laying around him. So Llewellyn tries to keep the ten million so his wife can have all that she needs, then thats when chigurh comes in. The man in back of the situation is Ed Tom Bell, an old sheriff thats new to these kind of crimes (hence the title of movie), with 1980s Mexican border problems, much more murders happen.These three men are never really filmed together throughout the movie, even though its a chase movie, but it shows how the creative mind of the coens put a unique their in there movie, which makes it not very visible to you. I've also heard that it stayed true to the book, and has set a great visual to it as well. The originality of this film definitely makes it a much watch, and its the bloodiest from the coens I've seen yet.Javier Bardem shows his skills in new type of work, being Chigurh. His creepy looks (mostly the haircut) shows that the character is insane, has no sense of humor, and no sense of compassion or regret. His weapons are as unique as him, being some strange air tank that shoots through locks, and this shotgun with a gigantic silencer, which probably makes most of the gore in the movie. Nobody can play a better role as Llewelyn than Josh Brolin. growing up as a country man made this role easy for him, just acting like himself will be perfect acting. Tommy Lee Jones plays sheriff Ed Tom Bell, which Jones also said that the character he was playing was a lot like him as well as Brolin, like some of the parts was just like a natural conversation to him.No Country For Old Men has inspired me in so many levels. A movie this original, could be one of the best. This movie is one of the best of the decade, very close to ""There Will Be Blood"", and thats one good compliment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Violence in the Heartland.,"At first, I saw this film as a straight story of violence and greed. However, it is so much more than just what's on the surface. The Coens take this interesting story of violence and turn it into one of the most shocking and intelligent studies of themes ranging from predestination versus the unpredictability of chance to American greed and consequences for violence.Llewelyn Moss is our main protagonist for the majority of the film, but it's Ed Tom Bell who serves as our opener and closer and his approach to the whole state of the world in this is a fantastic way of not letting the audience disappear into this world of violence. Instead of just accepting that this is the world of the film, we always have Ed Tom to come in and explain to us that this violent existence is our existence as well and it's disgusting. I've always loved the approach of a character who looks back on life with regret and this is one of the best examples of that. Tommy Lee Jones was the perfect choice for this role, and he really hits that stoic manliness while also just being filled with guilt and borderline disgust over the state of the world. Except it's gotten to a point where it's not even disgust anymore, it's just depressed indifference. It's brilliant.Our look at these characters ends with Ed Tom detailing one of his dreams to his wife. In the dream, him and his father were back in older times, traveling in this mountain pass. His father rides ahead with a fire and a blanket, not saying anything as he passes. The road is cold and dark and hard to get through, but Ed Tom knows that once he gets through it all and makes it to his father, he'll be warm and taken care of. Everything will be alright. Then comes the film's now-famous final line, ""And then I woke up..."", with him coming back into our world. It's kind of a chilling ending, again commenting on the rough and ruthless state of our current existence. Back in older times, no matter how hard things got, you would know that everything was going to be alright in the end. There would be a fire and light to keep you safe and warm. But now, that doesn't exist anymore. He woke up and now he's not so sure that everything is going to be alright when he gets through that rough terrain. There might just be more.I feel like the film is two almost separate entities. There's the chase down with Anton and Llewelyn and the drug money, then there's Ed Tom almost acting as his own audience, coming in and just being marveled by the immense violence that these men run through during the film. In so many ways, this is a film that doesn't follow any conventional means, and in keeping with this it's one of the few films where we not only see the consequences of violence, we see the aftermath. It's not like a serial killer movie where the detective gratuitously goes through the blood and carnage to find a clue. Ed Tom rides in and just...experiences the cost of the violence that these men don't think twice about when they present it into the world.One of the most interesting aspects of the film comes in the form of Anton Chigurh. Classified by most as a ""villain"", the character for the large part of the film represents so much more than that; anarchy, the cruel and unpredictable act of fate and, most importantly, consequence. A lot of people see Chigurh as just this unstoppable evil, but it should be noted that the character only acts out of a response to the violence of the world. He is only a part of this world because the world requires him to be. Someone like Chigurh coming into existence is nothing beyond the consequence for a world that has become so lost in it's belief that violence is the ultimate answer.Although in certain scenes, particularly the now infamous gas station exchange, he simply represents the uncertainty of fate. All of your life you make decisions that lead you down certain paths, and making one wrong decision could lead you to an immediate and unexpected demise. Chigurh at times can be the ultimate example of this, with the simple choice of heads or tails standing between you and a grave. The scene near the end with him and Llewelyn's wife, Carla Jean is a great representation of this whole thing. She tells him that he can choose to leave, that it's up him and he responds simply by saying that it's out of his control. Fate isn't in anyone's control and whether you like it or not, sometimes there are choices you make that lead you down completely different paths and this story just happens to have that choice potentially leading to the ultimate path.This is perhaps my favorite aspect of No Country for Old Men, the fact that the film isn't conventional in any way whatsoever. We have a ""villain"" with absolutely no backstory, there's no sign of hope or bright light at the end of the tunnel, the film doesn't end with a bang but with a whisper, major characters get killed off-screen, nothing is safe here and nothing is predictable. I think that the best films are the ones where you have no idea what's going to happen, but you know that whatever it is, it's going to be unique and incredible. You don't know what path you'll get taken down, but you trust the director(s) to take you down it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fineprint!,"Overview:No Country for Old Men is a movie based on a novel written by Cormac McCarthy with the same name. The story describes how a cop discovers a bag full of million dollars at a site where a drug deal went awry. The cop takes all the money and runs away with it. Chigurh, a professional hit-man, wants to retrieve the satchel of money (which contains a hidden radio transponder to which Chigurh has the corresponding receiver). With the help of the transponder Chigurh tracks the cop. What happens next is ought to be seen in the movie !Was it any good?No Country for Old Men will blow your mind off with the sizzling performances from all of its actors. Javier Barden is the show stealer in the movie. His portrayal of the character Anton Chigurh is very realistic and is worth every penny of your movie ticket! He won an Oscar for his work in this movie. Josh Brolin as the cop comes second in the department. I don't think any other actor has the guts to portray the character played by him. The role of a tough cop always suits him (see American Gangster). The movie has a 1980's touch to it. The barren lands of Texas sharing borders with Mexico adds a cow-boy-movies like backdrop to the film. I give it a 5/5 for the beautiful cinematography. One of the distinctive features of move is that there's hardly any background music in it. You just get to listen to a bit at the starting and a full length(er) at the end. This makes the viewing experience very different compared to other movies.Verdict:No Country for Old Men is a solid movie. Very realistic movie with some of the finest performances of the decade. It won 4 awards at the Oscars. If you have missed this film at the theaters, go grab a DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Brilliantly woven and perfectly executed, No Country for Old Men will surely be a film that etches itself into modern movie folklore.","The Coen Brothers' late 2007, early 2008 film No Country for Old Men has very, very quickly embedded itself as one of my favourites of the contemporary age of film-making. I've seen it a number of times now, two times of which have been in recent months alone – here is a film I get odd chills in just contemplating watching it or not. If there was a film released in Britain in the calendar year of 2008, that was better than this and wasn't Steven McQueen's Hunger, then I either haven't seen it or it doesn't exist. The film is a burning, brilliantly observed piece, encompassing the horror of the world; morality and plain pure old fashioned film making techniques such as the ability to build suspense and execute action. Once just isn't enough with No Country for Old Men.The film is a crime-infused, MacGuffin driven tale between two predominant sides playing cat-and-mouse with one another in the wide open playground that is the state of Texas in a dusty June, circa 1980. The two warring sides are Josh Brolin's downbeat and somewhat cynical Llewelyn Moss, and he's in direct competition with Spanish actor Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh; a cold and seemingly emotionless killer who appears to have gone rouge from his employers and is now on Moss' tail. Thrown in amidst these two are the elements of innocent bystanders; hide and seek games at road side motels; shop, trailer and toll booth workers; an angry group of Mexican gangsters whom show up in fits and starts with their own prerogative and the law themselves, this time in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff, named Ed Tom Bell.The chaos is ignited when Moss, having accidentally shot a wild animal in the leg whilst trying to score a body shot, notices a trail of blood left by a pit-bull terrier. Moss observes the dog, who eerily looks back at him with a sort of knowing sense of what bloodshed and chaos comes with what he's just run away from: ""Trust me, it's not worth it"" seems to be the exclamation. At the site, made more shocking by the presence of bullet ridden mutts, Moss waltz's through a barren patch of land inhabited by dead drug dealers, automatic weaponry and shot-up trucks. A few hundred yards off is a few million dollars in cash, which he swipes after appearing to confront himself with the question. A distant storm begins to break, with feint cracks of thunder – the bag that contained the money is beginning to double up as Pandora's box.The film's immediate opening is a voice over uttered by a man that has seen better days. His comments, recollections and opinions on life and the world is juxtaposed by some fantastic Texas scenery. Bell talks of the old times, and how some sheriffs in the past barely drew their gun as there was so little crime – just 35 minutes in sees Bell's deputy, who's just a kid in comparison, drawing his gun to enter a potentially dangerous property. Bell's reaction to this is fascinating. The beauty of the locale shooting suggests that the man still loves his home area and the place in which he has spent his whole life, but looks on with concern; that times change and people have to change with them otherwise they'll be left behind. What follows this knowing observation, the film's central theme of making sense of it all, is a brutal murder - the first of many Chigurh will commit. The Coen's thrust you into the centre of Chigurh's world with this killing, setting up the white-knuckle ride and getting across this guy's cold efficiency; something that is put in contrast with Moss' earlier inability to take his time, take aim and shoot a nonthreatening wild animal.While widely accepted as one of the greatest screen villains from recent years, Chigurh is a collection of very basic but very effective things. Predominantly, his uncanniness is born out of his weapons of choice; those being a stun gun later established to exist so as to kill livestock painlessly as well as a standard pump action shotgun that comes complete with a silencer, thus creating an odd metallic whooshing noise when fired. His sly and sporadic use of ambiguous quotes and metaphors combine with his ruthless ability to play games and con those around him, out of methods of transportation or whatever. The scene in mind that sticks out most is the initial ""call it"" exchange at a petrol station, during which odd shaped pieces of material are lined up behind the supposed victim; all of which are in the shape of a crude noose suggesting impending death, doom or execution.The film is violent, but the attention to the repercussions of violence are what makes it seem more gruesome than it is. When characters get injured later on, they need to treat themselves and this focus is ten times more nasty and more effective than, for instance, lining up nothing characters in a Saw sequel and lopping their limbs off. The film is so very visceral in its attention to sound; the build ups to two motel exchanges between certain characters is arguably more exciting than the following action sequences with light switches, floor boards, cocked guns and distant telephone tones all playing their part. With a sense of humour running throughout that is as dry as those rough, dusty early desert scenes and a fantastically structured narrative revolving around this man Moss; the decisions he makes and how they affect those around him and who he loves, No Country for Old Men is a stunning film and one of the best of recent times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Violent overrated movie!!,"Once again Hollywood picks a movie as best picture that should be great but falls far short of the mark. Last years departed is another example. This movie is so full of holes it makes Bonnie and Clyde's car look like it just drove of the assembly line. The acting was so so but not great as is required to win an academy award. This movie reminded me of those slasher films where the killer shows up everywhere and kills everyone and leaves bodies everywhere and the cops are absolutely ineffective and useless. The one scene where the killer is fixing his own gun shot wound reminded me of other movies such as Terminator and Rambo, it's all been done before and better. To sum up, if you like violent action shows it's pretty good, if your looking for a movie that is Best Picture material this is not it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coens do it again.,"""You can't stop what's coming. It ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity.""Even if No Country for Old Men didn't have gorgeous cinematography, excellent pacing, a near perfect script, and an absolutely perfect cast, I still would have loved it for its tone. It's the most similar movie to Fargo that the Coens have done, and the similar theme of implacable and unfathomable violence in a rural American area (once again initiated by money) is one of the main reasons why I love the Coens so much.The breathtaking, empty setting of south Texas is a seamless compliment to the measured pace of the movie. No Country has suspense coming out of its ears, as each scene seems to somehow surpass the previous ones in measured tension. The overall quiet of the film only serves to magnify the eventual scenes of violence when they come, and the fact that you don't see everything happen on-screen keeps the viewer fully invested in the story. There's no constant quick cuts and hyper-kinetic camera work to be seen; only long-smoldering sequences that pushes your anticipation to the brink of breaking, and then pushes it some more.In a cast this good, two people stand out even beyond the others. Tommy Lee Jones as the world-weary sheriff who's the heart of the story, and Javier Bardem as the relentless, inscrutable, main antagonist of the story. Jones was perfect, there's no other way for me to say it. And Bardem gives life to the best and most interesting villain since The Operative in Serenity. Both performances were among the best that I've seen in my life.No County for Old Men is the kind of movie that improves with every viewing. Ten years from now, I'll still be watching it and loving it.  It's film-making at its finest. When you take an amazing story and marry it to directors with immeasurable talent and a cast that couldn't have been better chosen, you get a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Country for Old Men,"Javier Bardem is just great in this! He is ""Anton"", a ruthlessly efficient killer on the hunt for a missing bag of loot that has fallen into the hands of the opportunistic ""Moss"" (Josh Brolin) after a drug deal goes awry. The latter man soon cottons onto the fact that his life is now considerably more at risk and he has to figure just out how to survive long enough to escape and enjoy his cash. ""Moss"" might just have an unlikely and unwitting ally, though, in the form of the pursuing but rather unenthusiastic sheriff ""Bell"" (Tommy Lee Jones) but, well you just wouldn't want to bet against the truly menacing Bardem! It's violent and brutal, sure - but it's also darkly humorous with plenty of pithy banter and quite some degree of characterisation from both Brolin and Bardem as the denouement looms large. That conclusion is as unpredictable as the rest of this quirkily scary and entertaining crime drama that uses an oxygen cylinder with startlingly effective results in this game of lethal Russian Roulette. Nobody is safe, nobody is innocent - and it doesn't matter whose side you are, ostensibly, on either. It's perfectly paced by the Coen brothers, the characters and the story given ample opportunity to develop and to breathe and by the conclusion I was definitely rooting for someone! It has shades of the old wild-west Texan Western genre to it, it reeks of authenticity and is really well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"The Art of simplicity and using it in creating an experience rich in tension, thoughts, and cinematic awesomeness.","Not many films accomplish what No Country For Old Men does. Coming from the Coen brothers, this slice of western-influenced, 80's style storytelling just flows in front of your eyes at a slow yet enigmatic pace, delivering a form of tension that you rarely get to see in films nowadays.To your ears, this experience will seem very intense yet pretty minimal, especially in terms of music, which is pretty much absent from the ensemble, only to leave you with the calm sounds of the windy Texas desert, dry gun cockings, the brutal sound of Chigurh's infamous tank or silenced shotgun (doing bloody damage shown in all its graphic greatness!), among many, many others. Every footstep is a part of the experience, every gun shot sounds loud and lethal, every silence builds the tension, and the almost scientific pace of NCFOM.Nowadays, music dictating how you should feel and crescendos on queue with the jump-off-your-seat moments is a common thing. Music being absent, you are left with your own nerves, and the incredible tension generated by Javier Bardem's character, one of the coldest-blooded human beings ever portrayed on film, period. What ensues is so effective and precise, it's both completely badass AND cinematically stunning.You become quite worried about this poor kid, Moss, who's being ruthlessly chased by this complete psychopath who murders anyone stepping on his path without any visible kind of emotion. With basic yet brilliant subplots involving Moss' wife, the Mexican cartel, and an ageing sheriff losing control and confidence in this whole situation, this adaptation of Cormac MacCarthy's novel will simply blow your mind if you have the slightest interest in either western cinema, genuine writing and storytelling, or minimalist cinema.Hell, whatever your favourite genre is, if you're not expecting Transformers or some other MTV-style blockbuster and have a minimal interest in auteur cinema, No Country For Old Men's experience will exceed any of your expectations.Now, what I previously called a ''subplot'' is, in fact, the whole core of the movie. It's Sheriff Bell's part. Again, it's very minimal, but it does dictate the whole narrative line of this film, and gives it its aura, its magic feeling of old people getting constantly bullied by the young, which is exactly why this film is called what it's called. And why you get this narration at the start, while witnessing some crude and cold violence, committed by a young man. Through two young men's classic western pursuit, you get an old man's struggle with the pain of getting old and feeling obsolete next to these younger, meaner wolves.This is why the ending is what it is as well. And what an ending this is! Pure brilliance. Had me smiling in admiration for 20 minutes after the film ended.A brilliant piece of cinema, just as incredible as Fargo was. Yet these are two very different films, they both shine with irresistible brilliance. Congratulations to this top-notch cast, these two incredible film-makers, this genius of a man who wrote this story, and to the whole team behind this modern-day masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not Your Typical 'Best Picture',"Hailed by thousands as an instant classic, and also hailed as a disaster by thousands more. It has been a while since a real 'artsy' type movie has been so successful at the Academy Awards, but this one is definitely deserving of all its glory.The film's central theme is not only a changing world, but the fact that the people who kept the world in order once before have seen their day and it has truly become 'No Country for Old Men'. With Tommy Lee Jones' opening and closing monologues, he beautifully exemplifies the point the story tries to make. It isn't easy to see, i assure you, which is why this isn't really a film for everyone. But deep meaning aside, the film also illustrates excellent use of suspense, character interaction, and amazing direction.It has been said that a single emotion can be the drive behind a story, and the emotion that really gets you while watching this film is fear. The Coen brothers brilliantly used fear to shape Javier Bardem's character as the 'psychopathic killer'. When he comes on the screen you get a sense of a dark shadow casting over the whole room and it really makes you feel like you are in the presence of true evil.I would like to point out that there is little to no music in the entire film. The use of silence throughout the majority of the movie is very original in the sense that the music doesn't cue the viewer how to react and when.So again, not for everyone, but if you are a frequent movie goer and truly understand the makings of a good film, this is an excellent one to see.I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did...it is definitely worth your time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Ferocious As Hell. ♦ 82%,"This is my second Coen Brothers' movie & I am already a fan. Because, it talks about life as a whole and not in parts.Always depicting violence, the makers in here have gone one step further into psychological reasoning behind the violence. The cast performance, cinematography, direction, plot & screenplay are perfect factors. Some of them are second only to music, although a little more engaging score could've changed my 8.2 rating. Speaking too much but not going over is what the plot does. The trembling effect it has on its viewers is that the definitions re boundless and 80% of the happenings are free to imagination. As the message that comes out of it is varied, No Country For Old Men is a must watch, since we need to feel the gravity of the other side of humanity.Alas, it does have its dull moments, mostly carried by conversations or self-thoughts. Personally, these are the only discrepancies I found.One more reason to watch is Javier Bardem & his phenomenal portrayal.

Amazing in so many realms,"This is actually one of the best book adaptions ever. It's almost impossible to tell a story accurately with such little dialogues and without a narrator voice, but the Coen brothers accomplished it fantastically. A perfect cast till minor roles and Javier Bardem makes one of the best film villains of all time! The style of the film is absolutely unique and the mixture of western, thriller and satire is excellent. The ending is realistic and leaves a couple of questions open, which makes you think a lot about the film afterwards. Everything seems sophisticated, even how scenes succeed on one another and that's what is so fantastic about this movie. Everything that happens in No Country For Old Men keeps your eyes peeled on the TV screen, even if it's just normal dialogue. I.e. the showdown between Chigurh and Moss, which is one of the most thrilling scenes I've seen lately or the Chigurh's conversation with the gas station proprietor which is absolutely awesome. The screenplay, the direction and Javier Bardem totally deserved the Oscar. There were better movies in 2006 but this flick is a very favorable tale about bad people that is both confusing and stunning.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This movie is one of the few that never annoy. It delivers only stellar acting and memorable characters and a plot full of inventive and satisfying twists and turns that keep you surprised all the way through, just like real life.

"From a good novel by Cormac McCarthy, rewritten by the Coens, favoring the action a'la Western, but instead of cowboys and gunslingers, we have drug dealers.","I have no doubt that the Coen brothers, despite being somewhat irregular, have talent. Following their work wonders such as ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""The Big Lebowski"", ""Barton Fink"" and ""Fargo"", they are now hogging all the awards with a Western-like thriller that features a not too original story though really exciting.The game of cats and dogs or cats and mice (call it what you want) is the basis of the plot, simple, nothing new but please note how the Coen brothers packed the story into a good film. We can almost all say that ""No Country for Old Men"" has all it takes to be a great film.Let's start from its hypnotic photography. It's really brutal with near- desert landscapes that reminds us of the glorious days of classic western films. Next, we continue with its amazing soundtrack, or the awesome script, full of goodies and other nice treats.The cast is also well-chosen, the indescribable chemistry between the cool Josh Brolin and pure evil Javier Bardem is simply spectacular. We should also remember Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson (in a short but flawless performance) as supporting casts.Another best thing about this film would be its perfectly measured pace. The script is just beautifully structured. I love how Joel and Ethan Coen alternate the situations through some clever film direction and editing, slowing down and speeding up at times. I also adore the visualized violence, brutal but still not gory.In conclusion, ""No Country For Old Men"" offers us a realistic approach and meticulous details so that beneath a classic Western action format so that not only do they revitalize the Western genre, but also making it a raw and unique experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
NEAR FLAWLESS THRILLER,"Will try to write about the one, but significant miscalculation, at the movie's end - without making this a ""spoiler."" Here goes: when you get to the final pages in McCarthy's novel, you can see it's winding down, so you begin to read slowly, being sure to take everything in - you can, of course, see that the typing stops in a few paragraphs and you know it's about to end. But when you get to this final scene in the movie version, the viewer has no such advance warning, so as the lead character reaches the end of his speech about a dream he's had, and the screen goes dark, the movie's end seems abrupt and un-satisfying. The Coens could have easily solved this problem by visualizing the dream, showing it with the speaker's voice on the soundtrack. Would have made for a much more cinematic finish. Still, that being said, this is a masterpiece - and one of those rare instances when the Oscar actually did go to the best picture of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Best film of the Decade,"As I sat in the theatre, about halfway through No Country for Old Men, I distinctly remember whispering to the person next to me this was Oscar gold. Little did I know that he was asleep. If nothing else, it just goes to show how peoples tastes vary, but I cannot imagine how anyone could fall asleep. This is a film that gets you hooked from scene one, and right until the ending, it is steeped in suspense, black humour, great direction and acting and it ain't afraid to get its hands dirty.Based on Cormack McCarthy's novel, No Country for Old Men dictates one simple truth. There is evil in the world, there always has been and there always will be. The previous generation of crime fighters including Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) are no match for a new generation of criminals, at the start of a new decade (the eighties). One such criminal is Anton Chigurth, who kills people with a pneumatic air gun. This strange fella is going after two million dollars in drug money which has been stolen by Llewelyn Moss. He is an ordinary Texan who just happens to stumble upon the after math of a drug deal gone wrong in the middle of the desert. He finds the money, and tries to figure out how to get him and his wife clear and safe. Meanwhile, the Mexican drug dealers, The Law, and Chigurth are all coming after him.It is all the little details in the film which are what contribute to its high quality. I'll give you a great example. No Country for Old Men, is sucked almost completely dry of music. In one or two scenes, there is a very soft synthesizer drone, but the silence is far more potent. Alfred Hitchcock with the Birds was the last time I saw a music-free feature film.No Country for Old Men is not for the soft of heart, or the squeamish, but it will be embraced by anyone and everyone who can appreciate great cinema. Though unfortunately it is not a very popular movie (or at least it wasn't when it came out), I have a feeling No Country for Old Men will age well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I don't exchange it for 1000 Fargo,"There a lot of people who hate the movie, not just disliked, they hate! Look at reviews or visit the forums, you will see. Art house movies are unconventional generally, but for No Country for Old Men is not an art house film, but it is not a blockbuster too. It is both, I mean artistic and at the same time entertaining. I know that the people who hate it would not call it entertainment, because they were not entertained. Then, why haters hate this movie? Because it is not a crowd pleaser? Well, firstly, they say that the movie was very dull, very very slow paced. If you ask me, the time flies by, I did not get bored at all. I was hypnotized, mesmerized. By the way, do you know what is one of the most frustrating things about this movie for me? Some people say this is inferior in comparison with Fargo or Blood Simple. I watched both movies and I am really sorry, but I enjoyed both movies, both are must- see experiences, but they are, Fargo, Blood Simple were just good movies to me, no more than that. A critics says that cinema feeling in There will be Blood was more strong than No Country for Old Men. How funny, I liked There will be Blood very much, but think just the opposite. The cinema of Old Men is more powerful than There will be Blood. Old Men is pure cinema. Another critic says that I would not call the movie masterpiece, because ultimately, a man pursues another man, this is the story. Well, this was what I wanted anyway, but also this is just the surface. The directors don't use background music (unconventional), I loved that, but this is the second complaint as I see. It makes the movie dull according to the haters. It causes me hypnotized. Many people like noisy, fast movies, this is the fact, isn't it? but why? Was Casablanca noisy or fast? No. Then, is it a movie to be hated? As for Javier Bardem, his performance, acting is appreciated even by the haters, otherwise I would kill myself anyway. Joking aside, you will think that I exaggerate, but no, to me, his performance, acting is one of the best ones of all time and his character is one of the best villains so far too. What Day Lewis is in There will be Blood, Bardem is in No Country for Old Men. A superhuman performance. Just by one scene, it can be understood. In one of the most disturbing scenes, even if off screen, I mean his last visit, after that, in the car, look at his face! It tells a lot of things. The opening scene of the movie is one of the greatest opening scenes ever made! In terms of content, it is horrible, in terms of cinema, it is great. In this scene, Bardem is at one of the zeniths of his performance by the way. To watch this character, Anton Chigurh was very entertaining, very interesting, sometimes funny and sometimes evil, horrible. One of the reasons that I love the movie is this, I mean, The Brothers created a great character, to be more precise, they adapted the character in a perfectionist way from the novel. As for Chigurh's weapons, forbidding, horrible, weird, but also inventive. I knew Josh Brolin by this movie, I can't remember him in The Goonies, I watched it when I was a child but. Therefore, I liked the actor very much including his character. After that I watched him in American Gangster and he was great in that movie. In this movie, he is in Bardem's shadow, but still does a great job. He was an interesting character too. On average, how many favorite scenes you have in a movie? No Country for Old Men is an exception for me, because if I count my favorite scenes, it makes almost the whole movie. All the scenes Bardem appears are my favorites once. I will mention some of them. The scene that he tries to find the bag by the device, the scene that he carries out first aid to himself (this scene also tells somethings about the personality of the character, he is really a psychopath, he seems panicked, he cares about himself, his health very much), the scene that he makes a sudden attack to the hotel, again a horrible, but in terms of direction, a fresh, great scene. I had not been on pins and needles like that in another movie. There are several reasons for that. For example, Anton Chigurh is like T-1000 from The Terminator 2. In some moments, I said to myself that's it! or something like that in theater. Now do you understand why I love that? As for the sheriff (our bonus Tommy Lee Jones), the first sheriff character on screen who is unwilling to solve the cases, catch the bad guys (unconventional and brilliant) And, as the third complaint, a few unexpected twists that take place near the final. It might be unsatisfying, but it was realistic and shocking. Everything does not work out the way we expect it will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coens sure know how to entertain,"The Coen brothers have given us many great movies, but 'No Country for Old Men' has to be my favourite of theirs. This film is 10 years old now but you'd be hard-pressed to find a better piece of entertainment released since. It's an enthralling watch from start to finish and one of the most memorable and unique movies of its time. Maybe it's a bold claim, but I think this is one of the best films of the 2000s.'No Country for Old Men' scores top marks in all areas, but the best part of the film for me is the characters and dialogue exchanges between them. Anton Chigurh in particular is a fascinating character and is brilliantly portrayed by Javier Bardem.The ending has proved divisive among fans, but I'm in the 'liked it' camp. Finishing with the 'old man' of the movie retiring is fitting with the title and was also suitably low-key. A brilliant film all round.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A gripping violent chase story with some dark humor in it,"A gripping violent chase story with some dark humor in it. A good guy (Sheriff by Tommy Lee Jones), a bad guy (Anton Chigurh by Javier Bardem), and a guy in between (Llewelyn Moss by Josh Brolin) chase one another after Moss takes the money from a botched drug trade crime scene.It is a simple story, but shot and made very stylishly. The characters and vast wild country environment (a character by itself) adds texture to the story. The film doesn't have a lot of dialogues, but rather establishes the characters from what they choose to do and how they choose to do it.One of the themes of the movie is how time and crime shifts in the west Texas. The movie is sandwiched by the sheriff's monologue at the beginning (how life was simpler and made sense in the old times; now he can't comprehend the senseless violence of contemporary crimes.) and his conversation with his uncle towards the end, about the illusion he feels and the disappointment of his inability to deal with this new kind of criminality. That is where the title comes from.Another theme is that you can't see (stop) what is coming. Anton Chigurh asks his potential victims to call a coin to decide whether to kill him/her or not. A woman by a motel pool flirts with Moss: That's who you keep looking out the window for? Moss replies: ""Just looking for what's coming."" The woman quips: ""Yeah, but no one ever sees that.""It is a movie that keeps you on the edge of the seat. But the ending is not very satisfying to me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Thin material padded out with over-familiar Coen gimmicks,"We've seen all this before and didn't really need to see it again. The ingredients in terms of the characters are very similar to Fargo - 1. Ruthless psychopathic killer(s), 2. Ordinary guy with bad motives getting into something over his head, 3. A good-hearted cop, outwardly unimpressive and seemingly impotent in the face of the evil thuggery let loose in the neighbourhood but clever and wise, trying to piece together what's going on and prevent tragedy. The story this time around however is thin and over-familiar - an obsessive vengeful quest, a duel between hunter and hunted that occupies most of the film. The characters too are dull in comparison to their Fargo counterparts. Despite the trademark style and quirky flourishes this is by and large a plodding, predictable exercise in ritualistic machismo. I didn't really care who got killed and when. It is not a masterpiece or even a return to form. The best moment was early on when the old almost retired sheriff and his young sidekick survey the bloody aftermath of a criminal deal gone wrong and exchange banter in theorising about what happened. Instead of developing the younger cop's part the scriptwriter casts it aside half-way through and with it goes much of the interest in the older cop too. The trail of violence runs its course and some empty banalities uttered by the world-weary lawman that pass for significant wisdom bring the proceedings to a close.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You've Been Duped !!,"Wouldn't it be funny if the Coen brothers primary objective was not to make a work of art but rather, a social experiment.Create a superbly crafted film based mainly on graphic violence and see what the public reaction is -- sort of a litmus test to shine a light on our collective mental health. Possibly a way to understand the limits of our fixation on violence.The Coens are just brilliant enough to possibly pull-off something like this.And judging from the orgasmic praise this movie has received from the intelligista, it seems we might be in deep trouble.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coens' dark and suspenseful masterpiece,"After seeing a couple films from The Coen Brothers during the last few months, I couldn't believe how amazing and talented they are as filmmakers. Inside Llewyn Davis was my favourite Coen Brothers film until now.No Country for Old Men entwines the lives of a hunter, a sheriff and a killer in Texas when a drug deal goes wrong and a bag full of cash is involved.With No Country for Old Men, The Coen Brothers revisit the Wild West but this time with a modern spin to it and I dug it all the way through. This has quickly become my favourite Coen Brothers film so far and with how high this film sets the bar, it will be really difficult to top this in my opinion. This is easily the darkest film I've seen from them and they do a great job establishing that. The gorgeous lighting and dark colour tones create an eerie and brooding atmosphere to this world. I also noticed early on the absence of music which was a choice that felt very purposeful and added to the tension. I don't think I've ever felt so tense during a film before. There were countless scenes where I felt my heart beating faster than ever before and it's due to the spectacular editing and direction by the Coens. This film is a great example of how you don't need music to make a scene more dramatic or intense.The performances are all fantastic. Josh Brolin gives one of his best here. He nails the accent plays Llewelyn Moss to the best of his ability. Tommy Lee Jones is equally terrific. There's so much going on with his character and he plays such an essential role to the themes of the film which I believe he fulfilled. The actor who really stands out here is Javier Bardem in the best performance of his career. Bardem embodies the menacing yet odd nature of Anton Chigurh so perfectly. It's a career-defining performance that won't be forgotten. Kelly Macdonald is amazing despite her short role and nails the accent completely. Woody Harrelson also does a great job with his role.I should have seen the ending coming considering how The Coen Brothers never go down the traditional route. It may disappoint some people but I found it to be thought-provoking. In many ways it made me think over the entire film and what it was trying to say. On the surface level this film may just be a suspense thriller but beneath that there are many layers to each character and situation. Like many of the Coens' films, there's so much to think about and discuss and I don't think I'll stop anytime soon.All in all, No Country for Old Men is a Coen Brothers masterpiece. It's dark, gritty and suspenseful throughout with exquisite filmmaking and exceptional writing. Anton Chigurh is one of the most interesting and enigmatic villains I've been exposed to and I cannot wait to watch it again and analyse it to a further degree.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My Cherry,"The movie that ""broke"" my perspective. It took me a while to see this movie, about midway through highschool, and as a result I had no idea what I witnessed. I'd never before seen a movie defy standards like it did up until then. There are three main characters, who are all played flawlessly. There is borderline no music, yet after watching it I can't imagine where it would fit. The ending is unexpected and it plays out like the end of an Ernest Hemingway novel. I don't know if I could find anything wrong with the movie if I tried, truly. The Coens are masters of their craft, and their adaptation of this Cormac McCarthy novel is a testament to that.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
excellent,"This movie is one of the best I have seen and it is all due to the psychological killer Anton Chigurh played by Javier Bardem. There is no real logic in his actions as he uses a coin in his decision making process (especially when he is going to kill somebody). He does this in a very cold way as if it is a matter of deciding in which restaurant am I going to eat today. This is something that I think gives him strength as he never doubts his actions, there is no second guessing. Of course this is a very sick individual. But there is a twist which I am not going to reveal here. Also the move hides a powerful message between the lines. For me it has a deep meaning when it comes to faith and chance. The character played by Tommy Lee Jones is also a powerful one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Coen's best film since Fargo.,"There are some things you should know about Old Country for Old Men. It is based upon the book by Pulitzer Prize winner Cormac McCarthy. It is directed by the Coen Brothers. It stars Tommy Lee Jones and Javier Bardem, (Sea Inside, Dancer Upstairs). It has been nominated for Best Picture for the Golden Globes and one would expect the same for the Oscars.Put simply, this is the Coen's best film since Fargo. This is a tense, uncomfortable film for all the right reasons, it's the effect most thrillers should but rarely offer. And yet there are subtle elements which lift it above the level of thriller which may leave fans of straight fare confused. To say more would be too revealing.Typically for the Coen brothers, it's very violent, but this only adds weight to Bardem's extraordinary performance, alone worth the admission price.The photography of the Southern American desert is graceful but spectacular and sits non intrusively alongside the narrative.'Rising' star Josh Brolin (Into the Blue, Goonies) is great to watch and you'll be pulling for him even though he's risking it all for the cash. Tommy Lee Jones plays Tommy Lee Jones in a role not too dissimilar, in feel at least, to his directorial Three Burials.There are other performances of note, including Woody Harrelson and Kelly McDonald (Trainspotting), but this is a showdown between Brolin and Bardem, with the Coens' hunching eagerly behind both. It's one of cinema's most enthralling battles.What else do you need to know? Zilch.(Review written at time of release).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best films I have ever seen,"No Country for Old Men is one those rare films that I not only never tire of watching, but actually seems to improve with each viewing. I have found that some people have not taken the time to see it simply because of the violent content. What a great shame and pity that they would miss out on and deny themselves a truly marvelous viewing experience. I don't recall people staying away from The Godfather because of the violence. To me it is not the violence but the sense of menace and dread that makes No Country for Old Men such a tension-filled nail biter and a truly edge-of-your-seat film. Everyone I have talked to who has actually seen it used the words "" very tense"" and ""it kept me on the edge-of-my-seat"". Javier Bardem's ""Anton Chigurh"" is the greatest screen villain since ""Hannibal Lecter"". Tommy Lee Jones played a very understated character in ""Sheriff Ed Tom Bell"", who is the conscience of the film. Josh Brolin was also excellent and vastly underrated as ""Llewelyn Moss"", the hunter who unwittingly becomes the hunted. The lovely Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald is also great in an all-too-small role as ""Carla Jean Moss"" (""Llewelyn""'s wife). She does a flawless West Texas accent. Woody Harrelson is also superb as the somewhat mysterious ""Carson Wells"", who we never really learn a lot about. Gene Jones is so superb and so memorable as a country store proprietor in a truly unforgettable scene. The Coen Brothers did a splendid job of adapting the book to the big-screen and their casting of even the smallest roles was flawless. I would not recommend reading the book by Cormac McCarthy before watching the film, as it would spoil some of the film's surprises. However I found that the book did clear up some of the things that the film did not explain in full detail. A great film based on a great book. It has fast become one of my favorites and I always recommend it to everyone I know who hasn't seen it. And the film's Oscar-winning cinematography by Roger Deakins makes it well-worth getting the Blu-Ray version and watching it on a big screen. The harsh and inhospitable West Texas landscape makes for a stunning background. No Country for Old Men may not be a perfect film but it comes as close as any I have ever seen in my nearly 53-years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No former glories for old directors.,"A huge fan of their early work and pretending that the last few films they made didn't happen I had high expectations for Joel and Ethan Coen's latest project. Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel 'No Country' is a return to form for the sibling filmmakers or at least it is for the first hour and a half. What starts off with some amazing cinematography and a Tommy Lee Jones voice-over boils over into a frenzied chase movie that has genuine tension running through its every pore and then sadly it doesn't really have an ending and all the good things that have come before seem somewhat spoilt. Javier Bardem is amazingly creepy as sociopath Anton Chigurh, his hair nearly as bizarre as his favourite method of killing, every line he delivers is unnerving and yet you hang off his every word. Josh Brolin Is great as Llewelyn Moss the Welder turned wanted man after he stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong and steals a case full of money so he and his wife can start a new life. Cue every man and his dog, literally, after Moss from cops to Mexicans and of course Nutcase extraordinaire Anton. There is very little screen time for either Lee Jones or Harrelson and if you blink you could be forgiven for missing either of their performances. There are some beautiful shots, some great lines and a fitting score but it is by no means perfect which is a shame. But for the most part the Coen's flourishes can be seen and there is nearly as much tension and suspense as there is blood but with such a strange ending and so many loose ends like not actually telling the viewer what happened or why I feel they still have some way to go to regain former glories, but this is at least a start.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Takes you by the storm every moment,"I haven't watched a lot of westerns and neither am I familiar with a lot of Mexican stand-offs but I do know of them. From a plot view, the movie is amazing because it is a western without being only a western. No Country for Old Men shines in its own light. The classic good guy bad guy situation looms over the whole movie but is never the central theme. The third main character, the sheriff really makes us understand what the movie is about. I wanna say a lot more things but can't give away the spoilers.Coming to the acting, it's just phenomenal. It is hard to point out flaws in the scenes it portrays and the actors who portray it. Tommy Lee Jones is reserved and is still looking back to the simpler times, the story for him is the theme of the movie for me. The movie's cinematography doesn't spark shock but rather visuals scare us, even the scenic landscape looks deadly. It gives the audience a chance to be a part of the movie.

However, surely for a movie or any story really to really grab you, one has to care. One has to care about at least one of the characters and some of the associated outcomes.None of the characters have any redeeming features really.

You really got to know and like Lewellyn, and then abruptly he's gone. We didn't see enough of his wife. Tommy Lee's performance was fine, but he was hard to understand most of the time. What's with Woody's character? Why was it even a part of the movie, it didn't really add anything to it. They could have left out all the scenes with the guy who hires him, too, and it would not have changed the movie. Anton has no redeeming qualities and is quite boring as a character.

"Drugs, money and violence","Despite its many good reviews from the press, this Coen Bros masterpiece is bound to have some criticism from ordinary members of the public once they have seen it and they don't fully understand what's it all about. Set mostly in Texas around the 1980s, this film contains what is considered to be brutal and with gruesome violence for the reason why it sometimes has its criticisms and some saying that Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff ET Bell wasn't doing anything to tackle it with the real killer getting away with it only just. Well, others would consider saying that he wisely chooses to distance himself and not to risk it because what's the point when it comes to dealing with a vicious triangle of dodgy drug gangs as it would be difficult to tackle it alone. Even so, there are also some ""ordinary"" people whom were also being killed and that's mainly because some of these civilians ""choosed a path"" what's the point in getting involved in a life of crime and with these criminal activities and what's the risk. On the other hand, I would still think this film to be a masterpiece from the Coen Brothers and its well made and I would recommend it only to those whom would have a better understanding on what's it all about.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

We can see that the protagonist is not the typical ""Hero beat bad guys"" kind of thing but instead is the worn out sheriff. Even on one scene he mention that He can't win, he's too exhausted. During the movie, I should warn you. You might fell asleep from all the quiet, slow pace of the story but those can be easily ignored by excellent aggressive acting of ""Javier Bardem"" (Anton) the antagonist and ""Tommy Lee Jones"" the sheriff protagonist having to chase after Anton.

If you haven't seen this rubbish film then you shouldn't read what I am about to write because I have written some talking which have details all about almost all of the plot. I would suggest most pleasantly that you DO NOT READ THIS because it will be bad for you and will spoil things in this movie.A lot of people have been tricked into liking this film because this is one of those films that tries to make you think it's better than it actually is, but if you think about it you will see it's rubbish. Everybody mumbles or wails like pigeons. I wish I could make sounds on this website to explain.It's all about a man who finds some money and runs off. He's being chased by a man who wants to kill him and steal his money. This man has weird hair that hangs off his head like yesterday's tacos and he is annoying to look at. He mumbles so nobody knows what he is saying. He carries a silly little toy (that is actually massive) that kills people with little puffs of air (as if air could kill people LOL!). He is being chased by a crooked old man who is a sheriff who always looks like he's about to cry. The man with the money even has a wife (she's the one who sounds like a pigeon) who looks miserable and has a face like a wedge of cheese. There are WAY TOO MANY characters in this film.What is also rubbish is that we never see what's happening because the camera is pointing in the wrong direction for all the exciting stuff like killings and explosions. It takes 10 boring minutes of planning an explosion and then when it happens it's in the background and we can't see it properly. When everyone gets killed at the end (which is rubbish) the camera is pointing at the sheriff driving a car, and WE DON'T EVEN SEE IT HAPPEN!

A Fantastic Dialog Masterpiece,"This is the Cohen brothers Masterpiece and its an underrated movie. The dialog is extremely good. The quotes are funny, scarry and deep in meaning. The movie is what i could say raw, by the sense that there is hardly any music or emotions but you can tell those emotions if you look close enough in the actors faces. This is probably one of the main reason why some people dont like it, but if i can say to those people a word, i would say stop watching and try to understand the bigger meaning. The way the scenes transit to each other is very special. They cut a scene leaving you to ask questions but they don't answer them. Its a good example that we don't need to know everything in a movie for it to be good. Everything in this movie has hardly never been done anywhere else before.

The underrated Josh Brolin is impressive as the Vietnam veteran who stumbles across a drug deal gone murderously wrong, while Tommy Lee Jones is exceptional as the policeman who overviews the case in its bloody entirety.

This isn't your average crime thriller, this story shows you just how much stuff can go wrong when you stumble on a drug deal gone wrong and find a large amount of cash, what could go wrong.. that is with a tracker involved which makes it all the more exciting to see who lives and who dies in this epic tale of greed and out right bizarre criminals. Talking of criminals it is very criminal that I hadn't seen this, I was so entertained by every aspect of it and I have so many regrets that I didnt catch it sooner.The mind games are so iconic in this that Javier Bardem plays as Anton Chigurh, my favourite scene was the gas station, I don't involved spoilers in my reviews so that's all I'll say but I found it so chilling in the best way possible.

No Country for Very Much Anymore,"I have to say that this movie was intriguing, full of surprises and more violent than I expected. And although I suppose I understand the intentions of the plot, as convoluted as it was, I am kind of disheartened that it won so many academy awards. It's not just that it was full of errors (check the goof section), nor is it that in my own humble unprofessional opinion that although Javier Bardem was great, I saw no acting that was worth the award - I just don't think the role was written well enough to support it. But most of all, I really don't know what to make of anything anymore when a film of such overwhelming violence is put on such a coveted pedestal. Yes, I am aware that there have been other violent movies that have won, and maybe it is just the sad revelation that as I get older, what we see as entertainment - strike that - what we see as THE BEST of entertainment, is still nothing more than useless violence that carries with it no repercussions for the guilty. The film industry rarely gives us what we need, but feeds us over the top with what we shouldn't have; glorifying theft, betrayal, greed, and as we see in our latest best picture, murder. Maybe I'm just getting older, I don't know. Personally I can handle the violence and all the other garbage, but I also believe the more graphic and blatant our so called entertainment becomes, the less value it must have. But as I said, this is just my unprofessional opinion, so I'll end this ""review/rant"" with this; if you are in the mood for a story full of death, some of it implied, some of it right there for you to enjoy - and if you are itching for a movie with no happy or justifiable ending, leaving you feeling like you went on a ride that was supposed to be the best ever but was really just sitting in your car parked in your garage with the motor running, then by all means...Enjoy!",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Why would anyone make this movie?,"Maybe I'm admitting to old fogey-hood, but, to me, this movie is bad for society, though it's effective, disturbing cinema. I can see two powerful fallouts from it: 1) people with a violence problem have found a new hero. The movie makes it seem realistic that this Terminator-like avenger could actually be that continually successfully lethal and impregnable. Someone will channel that guy. 2) Is anyone going to stop to help a stranger after seeing this? Is anyone actually going to want to interact in any way with a stranger??? These points, though heartfelt, are somewhat ironic. The movie could also be looked at as a statement ABOUT our society which glamorizes violence. Yes, it was effective, but I worry about its impact",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"an instant western classic about drugs, greed, death and hopelessness","No Country for Old Men is an instant western classic about drugs, greed, death and hopelessness. Led by an all-time great performance from Javier Bardem playing a macabre character in Anton Chigurh, the film is a heart pounding non-stop manhunt packing enough emotional wallop while successfully exploring its themes.Set near the US-Mexico Border, the film can be considered as a cautionary tale about the War on Drugs which has raged for decades. Motivated by greed Llewelyn Moss, played by Josh Brolin, takes off after finding a bag of cash on a site of failed transaction resulting to massacre. Unbeknown to him, placed inside is a tracker. Anton Chigurh hunts down Llewelyn Moss for the money. As the hunt progresses, snippets of dialogue and character interactions show that Chigurh is not evil, but merely a servant of death or death itself. Guided by a twisted philosophy, Chigurh kills because of fate and destiny. Moss sends away his wife and mother-in-law as the hunt becomes not merely about the money but also personal. Other characters appear to further provide insight and growth such as Woody Harrelson, who warns Moss that facing Chigurh is a death sentence. No character is as important to carry the film on an emotional level as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, played Tommy Lee Jones. Embodying the hopelessness pervasive throughout the film, Sheriff Ed is an active participant in the manhunt aiming to prevent it. Despite his efforts, people die. Anyone who faces Chigurh dies. His scenes throughout the manhunt are beautiful, sad and introspective. Already an old man near retirement during the course of the film, the ending where he is retired perfectly captures the essence of his arc losing all hope living in world where death is unstoppable.While No Country is an excellent play about its themes, it lacks a true emotional anchor that carries the movie. Llewelyn Moss and Sheriff Tom aren't particularly engaging characters that captures the viewer's empathy.The Coen Brothers also bring technical qualities that complement the story. Wide and barren shots to portray a sense of epic scope, an almost non-existent score to build tension naturally and violence fitting for the antagonist.No Country for Old Men is a must see not only for its antagonist but as a whole.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Excellent adaptation from a book,"I read some if the reviews that hated this movie. They all complained there was no story. I can't believe they missed it. The only thing I can say is the movie tells the ""story"" as it was written in the book. I think for many the fact that there's unresolved conflict is what causes them to feel there's no story. I saw the movie in the theater and was so moved by it I had to read the book which is even better than the movie. The movie and the book are very unconventional. Carmac McCarthy has a style of writing that's elusive and heavy with symbolism and that's told in a manner that makes it feel common place and real. His setting is Texas and his characters are everyday people from the region.There was one reviewer who didn't understand the story and his questions were clearly explained. Maybe he stepped away at some point and missed some important scenes in the movie.If you haven't seen this movie, watch it. It's incredibly disturbing. More of a horror movie than a crime drama.

"Brooding, Unusual and Completely Unforgettable","I hadn't seen this since it was in cinemas, and found that it's even better than I'd remembered. It's a very unusually-paced film, with a lot of long silences, seemingly-innocuous conversations and dangling plot threads that don't ultimately lead anywhere. In many instances that could make for some infuriating viewing, but in the Coen brothers' hands it all somehow comes together into a master tapestry. The word of the day is suspense, an emotion the brothers have excelled at in the past, and No Country is a glorious example of it at play. The film's three protagonists, retiring sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), stone-cold killer Chigurh (a terrifying, star-making turn for Javier Bardem) and land-living cowboy Moss (Josh Brolin), never actually meet face-to-face but the wake of ripples left in their dueling pursuits is enough to power several movies' worth of rich, intriguing material. Sweaty, intense action walks lockstep with outstanding characterization, top-notch dialog and a hearty dose of respect for the novel. Like many Coen classics, it gets better with each subsequent viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Country for Old Men,"No Country for Old Men is a rare movie that gets every aspect of film perfectly. Every character gives an award deserving performance? Yes. The script perfect? Yes. The cinematography, the directing, the camera angles? Yes, yes and yes.No Country for Old Men starts with a very creepy Javier Bardem who is chasing Brolin's character (who is very much deserving the academy award). The Coen Brothers nail the atmosphere of a modern western. The filming is done in Texas, and if it wasn't for the cars, you would think its a classic western. The sets, everything from the desolate wilderness, to the run down motels, fit in perfectly with an excellent atmosphere. The script sets up a very tense film, a chase between three different characters.I am almost positive that you will be entertained while watching this movie. It is one of the best of the 2000's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Dark and brutal, The Coen Brothers nailed it 8\10","""No Country for Old Men"" is a brutal masterpiece. It depicts perfectly the horror and violence that America lives in. Usually the Coen Brothers' movies are dark comedies such as ""Fargo"" and ""The Big Lebowski"". This time, Ethan and Joel Coen have decided to make a full dark movie in terms of: genre, image and tone.The movie centers around Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who finds two million in cash after stumbling upon a drug deal gone wrong. What may seem as a happy ending turns out to be a cat and mouse game between Moss, the cartels and Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hitman who is a psychopath. (no better way to describe him). The story follows Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the sheriff of the town who investigates the case of Moss, Bell is supposed to represent the old generation of the country that had more morality, so it's because of the things he witnesses that he is retiring from his job, the world is too brutal for an old man like him, thus the title of the film.What most interested me was Chigurh's character, we as the audience see him only from the outside and know nothing about him, we know nothing about his background story nor how he became a hitman, his childhood or anything actually. He is definitely the type of character you want to explore more of. Overall this is a great movie, normally I wouldn't expect something brutal as this to come from the brothers but I'm mostly impressed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Shame about the beginning and ending of the movie,"For me, the beginning and the ending prevented the movie being from being a good and thrilling movie. The first 20 to 30 minutes of the movie was slow which I didn't mind to be honest because the movie started to get more intriguing and I started to understand and follow the plot a bit more. So the movie was good until towards the last 30 or so minutes where it was anticlimactic because they didn't show the big final action scene like the vast majority of other movies do. I understand they was trying to be different from the other movies, but the ending just didn't give me a satisfying and intrigued feeling which movie endings should do. Positives of the movie are that I thought the action scenes were good and I liked the character Anton Chigurh because I thought he was very portrayed well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Disappointed,"This nihilistic death fantasy by the Coen brothers is a real disappointment. It is structurally impossible to believe, and its incoherent ending left me feeling nothing short of defrauded. Don't take anyone you care about to see this truly depressing show, unless, of course, you think they'd enjoy watching scene after scene of prolonged acts of sadistic murder as the apparently invisible killer (he literally vanishes from the street after being blasted with buckshot) drifts freely through a naive world filled with defenseless victims and never-ending justice. In this low-rent tale, Tommy Lee Jones plays a useless, impotent, befuddled old sheriff. In real life, he is an amazingly talented actor who needs to fire his agent.--Spike Walker-Oregon USA",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Film For Faint Hearted Men,"This film is terrifying, quite possibly one of the most terrifying films I have ever seen. Now don't read that first sentence and stop reading, the film is terrifying yes, but also terrifyingly brilliant. I would go as far to argue that it is the best psychological thriller I have ever sat through, it just had all the right ingredients and equally was missing all the crucial bits.Sometimes its important to praise something for what its missing, not just what its got in abundance. A good psychological thriller is meant to leave the audience asking questions, to allow them to draw their own conclusions on aspects of the plot which are frankly, not crucial. So yes this film did have plot holes, however I feel every one of them was deliberate. Mainly because it encourages you to ask questions, challenge theories and ultimately be psychologically tested.Additionally, this film lacks a score, with virtually no music whatsoever: adding to the terror of this film. It creates an atmosphere which doesn't just stay on the screen, but oozes into your front room and grips you around the throat. The camera work, the pace, and most of all the assailant.Bardem's character is clearly what makes this movie. The aura surrounding this psychopathic murder is so intense that you feel yourself tensing up every time he comes into view, yet you are so intensely fixated by his ruthless, emotionless manor so that you don't turn away. Even from the very first shot of this masterpiece creation, you are immediately made to feel uncomfortable. The shocking realism of this cinematic creation is blood-curdling. Even if the rest of this film was terrible, I would probably praise it just as much for the creation of such a villain.Luckily, its not. Brolin and Jones clearly are due some praise, both delivering solid performances. All three performances offer contrasts in pace, technique and screenplay skill, culminating in a memorable masterpiece worthy of praise for a long while yet.Basically just watch this, you will not know just how terrifyingly brilliant this film is until you feel your mind racing afterwards.92/100",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"expected a little better, pretty good but not masterful","Not a bad movie or anything but i felt like it lacked lots of depth with a very simplistic story. The best part of the movie easily is Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh, who delivers an extremely good performance. Actually, this movie is very well made, well written (dialogue wise), and well acted. But I honestly though the plot was just too simple. Characters aren't really fleshed out that well, and even though they're likable, they're not very deep. I guess its meant to be a simple story, but in this case i think it works to the film's detriment. Aside from the entertaining murders and chase scenes, the film doesn't have much to offer. It made it hard for me to be immersed in the film or grasp the stakes because there just isn't much there to grasp in the first place. I felt it more style over substance honestly. Very good style, but still almost no substance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
nihilistic escapism,"Marred only by the fashionably nihilistic stated theme, the movie is fun to watch when it has momentum and also tense when it wants to be. But a grandmother character sticks out like a broken bone among an otherwise great cast as indirect as the screenplay tries to be with exposition it sounds ham-fisted in its attempts to prove the crazy hit-man baddie's world view correct. It will be called a ""smart man's thriller"" but it still has moments where the audience may be brighter than the protagonist and a tracking device premise that we have already seen easily defeated in The Da Vinci Code. So much for playing superior, Coens. The movie is at its best in silent stretches, though tolerable when reflective. Based on a novel or not, for me it is the movie where Two-Face/Harvey Dent Tommy Lee Jones from Batman Forever is trying to track down a baddie who has the same quirk of coin-flipping to determine one's fate. It occurs to me that we give a bad guy more slack; he can be a superhuman Rambo figure sewing himself up and evading the worst you can dish out as long as he makes matters worse. It's not pandering to wish fulfillment fantasies, unless your wish is to steer clear of happy endings. Is there any such thing as a spoiler if the ending is a downer? I say no, but I've left out the details just in case.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best r-rated movies out there,"No country for old men isn't for everyone. It's a very violent movie and when I say this, I really mean it. The violence on this movie is really rare to find nowadays. And I wouldn't really called it an action movie, because there is more killing than actual fights. Now this is just a taste of what you will see on this film. Know if I had to pick the best part of this movie it has to be the acting, especially from the actor that plays Anton. There is an real studie where a psychiatrist went through all the movies with psychopaths to see which one is the best interpretation of a psycho. And guess who was it? Anton. Which is funny since the actor is a known pacifist and even thought on refusing the role, but thankfully he didn't. The story is also great and the direction makes the tension really high and the movie makes you can't stop watching it until the end. Talking about the end,that's unfortunately where this movie fails. I know that alot of people defend it has a deeper meaning behind but, honestly I still think they could have made a more conclusive ending and not try to make it so abstract. At the end of the day one of the best movies ever but unfortunately not perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Southern Fried Murder,"The Coen Bros. have had their heyday long before the release of No Country for Old Men. Had they left the 90's burnt out, it would've been completely understandable. But 10 years ago, they crafted an ingenious comeback by making perhaps the most convincing, powerful film about pure evil in history. No Country for Old Men is one of the greatest films ever made.. but you already knew that. I'm sort of late to catching up to this one and I regret it entirely. Visually speaking, it captures the darkness of our world in ways no film has ever been capable of. In terms of acting, it absolutely soars. Broiln and Jones are incredible. Javier Bardem is terrifying as Anton. He eats at your soul. As far as films that depict serial killers, this is as real as it gets. Right down to his weapon of choice, an air-powered captive bolt gun. The savagery is what gets me the most.No Country for Old Men explains to us in no uncertain terms how malicious and conniving humanity can be.

Everything is paced to the very exact second, an allegory of a fate that catches up with everyone and from which no one can escape. We all know that a single decision can change our lives forever and this film exposes this mechanism for all to see. We put ourselves completely in the shoes of the main character and we associate ourselves with his destiny and his mistakes. He faces a force of quasi-mythological power which is embodied in one of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema, played brilliantly by Javier Bardem. The tragic violence of Cormac McCarthy and the deadpan style of the Coens blend into a miracle of balance, a manifesto for the immeasurable force of narrative cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Second half is a let down,"The film starts like a thriller. We meet Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who seems to be killing for fun. Then we meet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who finds a bag full of dollars. And then, Anton is chasing Moss. The film moves like a thriller. But unfortunately, it does not end like one.There is no history or reason to Bardem's character. He is pure evil. He is invincible. On the contrary, Brolin's character is real and vulnerable. This difference in their characters lends a demon-vs-human kind of feel to the story. But the second half of the film disappoints. Chigurh's chase and Moss' accidental fortune both end in nothing. Then there is Tommy Lee Jones character which I found added nothing to the storyline, other than dollops of philosophical musings.Javier Bardem packs in a powerhouse performance.

That's ""No Country for Old Men "", with humans and a nowadays western, and arguably the best work of Joel and Ethan Coen .... the Coens! The story begins when Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a former Vietnam veteran finds a briefcase with $ 2 million at a crime scene. Suddenly finds himself being hunted by the pure evil that is the character Anton Chigurh (Javier Barden) a violent persecution from Texas to the Mexican border. And behind them, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) in search of Anton and somehow protect Llewelyn. Most intriguing in this persecution is that the three characters never interact, just chase between them, which increases every second.The Coen once again surpassed themselves, not only were super loyal Cormac McCarthy's novel, but took your stuff to a new level. ""No Country"" has a dark tone and a really scary cat-and-rat persecution through the vast modern western that brings many kills and whiles much suspense. The three characters never interact in the film; one is always one step after another, getting much more electrifying and frightening.But even with the dark tone, the Coens have managed to make the film strangely fun, the little black humor of the Coens (even in small amounts) is present here. Not only is the tiny humor that make's the movie really fun to watch, but is full of intriguing dialogs and very interesting to listen to, the Coens have never been good at writing on his films. But not only is the partnership of the two brothers in the screenplay that stands out but also the direction. The film manages to have action sequences filmed in a greater perfection and style, the two Coens working behind the camera is delightful to watch.The cast also not left behind, both Tommy and Josh are perfect in their roles, but Javier is fantastic in every detail, her character is so mean and cruel and at the same time, very intriguing. He is the wild cat whatever grease, money Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee's old dog who wants to do ""justice"".The Coen brothers were overcome by presenting a film written and performed in a fantastic way, a story full of suspense and a final electrifying message as in every movie of the Coens, while in ""Fargo"" it was about the lack of decency and respect for human beings , ""No Country for Old Men"" takes us back to the lack of honor that our society suffers today, and how respectful and honorable are our ancestors.

Quirky Anti-Western Chase Film,"Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MAN is quite simply a joy to watch, as it continually frustrates our expectations of what kind of movie it is expected to be. Set in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico itself, it is a western that isn't a western; a chase film in which bad guy Anton Chigurh (Javier Badem) pursues Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), while being himself pursued by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). One of those chases is resolved; the other is left hanging in the air. The film builds up a fair amount of suspense, as we wonder whether Chigurh and Bell are going to get their men, yet the Coen Brothers continually combine that suspense with an eye for telling detail, or the inclusion of quirky sequences designed to show the futility of the entire quest theme. One of my favorite quirky sequences takes place in a dirty roadside motel, where the camera cuts to a sign outside saying (""HBO Available""). The whole notion of cable television in this kind of motel seems particularly incongruous. The performances are simply brilliant: Bardem doesn't have a lot to say, but communicates everything through telling glances. By contrast Brolin seems more laid back, despite the fact that he is being continually pursued. Jones goes through the motions of ensuring that justice should be done, but seems to be looking for a quiet life all the time. It is significant that the dramatic tension slackens somewhat during his sequences. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the kind of movie that befits repeated viewings in order to uncover its subtleties. A true modern classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A movie that always keeps you on the verge. A lot of tension and excellent buildup.,"""No Country for Old Men"" is one of those rare movies for which I do not have any remark. The buildup and the tension that the Cohen brothers managed to craft is amazing and the film keeps you constantly on the verge. You always wonder which is the next move of Chigurh, which is the strategy of Moss to avoid getting killed. All the events are so well connected and especially believable. Nothing feels forced or out of the place.Characters are amazing. Anton is cold and ingenious. He is extremely calm, while he performs his hits, a perfect psychopath, that really scared me for his behavior. Javier Bardem gave an excellent performance and this role just fit him like a glove. Tommy Lee Jones plays the sheriff of a small town, where basically nothing really bad happens, and despite his skills, he decides to avoid the main investigation because he does not want any kind of responsability or pressure. His acting is just on point, as he speaks with the accent of the county. The whole cast is composed by grade A actors such as Woody Herrelson or Josh Brolin. They have completely nailed it.After more than 10 years, this product is still one of the most beautiful crime stories: the script is extremely solid, I never felt bored or annoyed by some scenes or characters. This is how a film should be made, if you want to keep your audience invested. I definitely recommend watching it.

A tense and absorbing Masterpiece,"No Country For Old Men was deserving of all the praise and awards it got back in 2007. While I did root for other films of that year to win Best Picture, like Atonement or There Will Be Blood, with a repeat viewing of NCFOM, this is just under those films, if not right on par with them. The screenplay is very meaningful and thought-provoking as it is tense and thrilling. This is a Western thriller, a subtle but very absorbing film. The lack of a soundtrack really adds to the film's tension, and we are more concentrated on all of the little things that happen. The Coen brothers have only made one other film in the past that had really surprised me, and that was Fargo. While I still am not sure which is better, I think both are Masterpieces and deserve to be classics for years to come.The performances in the film are strong. Most notably, Javier Bardem. His performance won him an Oscar, and very deserved. He gives a creepy and subtly controlled performance, and makes a villain like no other since Anthony Hopkins in The Silence of the Lambs (and since then, Heath Ledger has also joined that list). Kelly Macdonald and Tommy Lee Jones were also pretty amazing, the former giving one of my favorite supporting female performances of 2007. Josh Brolin is strong, but his role requires less of a big acting challenge than Jones or even Macdonald I would think. Woody Harrelson was great in his small screen time, and he made the best of it. The cinematography is perfect, as you would think from the guy who also shot the amazingly beautiful The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.What I also love about this film is that simple meaning of violence in this country. The film's opening monologue by Jones, and his closing scene proves that this really was his story, and also the reason for the unresolved plots. While I was one of the few that was frustrated by the final scene in the film, I can truly appreciate it now. No Country For Old Men is a great film, powerful and absorbing!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coen Brother's Finest,"Anton Chigurh: What's the most you ever lost on a coin toss.Goddamn! The Coen Brothers are back and in full form. It seems as though 'No Country For Old Men' is the film to beat this year for the coveted Best Picture Oscar prize. Although it was a different film than I expected, it's every bit as powerful, tense, awkwardly funny and relevant as I had hoped, perhaps even more so. Based on Cormac McCarthy's critically acclaimed novel of the same name, 'No Country For Old Men' is a deeply symbolic and straight-forward story of the struggle between good and evil. The film opens with a flawlessly delivered monologue by the ever-so-great Tommy Lee Jones who portrays Sheriff Ed Tom Bell. Bell is a small-town sheriff in the state of Texas, and in his monologue he talks about how hardened and ruthless we've become as a society. ""The crimes we see today...it's hard to even take it's measure. It's just all out war."" mutters Bell. This monologue is the perfect setting for Llewyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who while hunting antelope in the desert stumbles upon half a dozen dead Mexicans, heroin and $2.4 Million. Being the road scholar he is, Moss figures no one will come looking for the moo-la if he snatches it. WRONG! Not only does the Mexican mafia and reputable bounty hunter / smart-ass Carson Welles (Woody Harrelson) pursue Moss, but also one of the most twisted, unpredictable and unreasonable villains in recent film history. His name is Anton Chirguh (Javier Bardem), and when he's not blowing innocent civilians' heads off with a cattle gun or flipping a coin to determine whether you live or die, he quietly observes everybody and everything around him.'No Country For Old Men' is a triumph in film-making in that the film has no real flaws. Critics might pan it as ""slow-moving"" but that's essential in order to correctly build the tension for the key scenes. Most of the film is actually quite fast-paced with such nerve-wracking sequences it will have you on the edge of your seat with a knot in your stomach for a majority of it's runtime. But 'No Country's' quiet and subtle scenes are every bit as powerful as it's action-packed and suspenseful ones. This is due in large part to the screenplay. Supposedly following very closely to McCormac's novel, the Coen brothers deliver their finest work EVER from a screen writing perspective. Yes, it's even better than 'Fargo'. As for the Coen's directing and editing, it has never been smoother. The film's transitions are nothing short of breathtaking.From an acting stand-point 'No Country For Old Men' is also incredible. The stand-out of the film is of course Javier Bardem as the ruthless homicidal maniac Chirguh. Just his facial expressions and body language is enough to make your skin crawl, and if that's not enough, he delivers every line including his catch-phrase ""friend-O"" with such brooding intensity and creepiness it makes you want to sink in your seat. Bardem is a lock for a Best Supporting Actor nomination this Oscar season, but his biggest competition is the two other key performances of the film. Josh Brolin who last week impressed me with his malicious turn in 'American Gangster' as a crooked cop, is the best he's ever been here in the role of Moss. Moss is such an unlikely hero in the sense he is kind of dumb, not very nice, makes stupid decisions and yet we still root for him to escape the drudges of the Mexican mafia and even worse, the wrath of Chirguh. Tommy Lee Jones I'd say is Bardem's biggest competition. With this and 'In the Valley of Elah', Jones has proved this year with these two performances that if anything he's getting better with age. Jones' monologues are flawlessly delivered like I previously stated, including his final one which left me with goose bumps at the end of the picture. Woody Harrelson is humorous in his limited role as a sharp-witted and over-confident bounty hunter, and Scottish actress Kelly MacDonald is phenomenal in her role as Moss' butter-brain wife. The film has a numerous amount of strong small performances including Garret Dillahunt as Bell's Deputy, Tess Harper as Bell's wife and the 'Office Space' stapler guy (Stephen Root), in a well-played dramatic role as a crime boss. Roger Deakins outdoes himself yet again with some awesome cinematography, and while quiet and subtle, the film's music score is haunting.There is no other film this year that I can recommend as highly as 'No Country For Old Men'. There are times when it has you on the edge of your seat in suspense, there are times when it has you laughing violently at some of the darkly humorous scenes and through-out the entire 121 minutes it has you using your brain. There's a lot of symbolism and powerful metaphors in the film, but since I'm not writing a 5-page essay, I'll let you figure them out for yourself. With 'No Country For Old Men' the Coen Brothers have once again raised the bar on how outstanding and thought-provoking a simple crime-drama can be. Grade: A",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Coen Brothers' nihilistic western thriller inspired on Cormac McCarthy's novel is pure cinematic beauty,"Life in west is violent, at least that is what many cinematic entries in the western genre lead you to believe. Hollywood moguls Joel and Ethan Coen take on the audacious of taking the pages of Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name and spinning it into cinematic proportions. It is significantly difficult feat to pull as McCarthy's sophisticated style of writing have lead many to believe translating his works into films are far too easier said than done. In spite of this, it appears that no one's directing methodology is a suitable match of McCarthy's writing other than the Coen Brothers. In a splendid effort, the masterminds behind such projects as 'Fargo', 'The Big Lebowski', and their debut 'Blood Simple' bring McCarthy's western tale to life in an pure enthralling fashion. It is violent, gory, and unquestionably dark in tone. But beneath the surface is immersive talent of the Coen Brothers who more than effectively uproot a tale of fate, conscious, and perplexing morality. Set in 1980, this film follows Southern Texas native Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin), a retired Vietnam veteran who goes on a hunting trip only to come across a string of dead bodies in what appears to have been a drug deal gone awry. Upon investigating the gruesome scene, he gets a hold of a suitcase containing a few million dollars. While Llewelyn manages to run away with it in attempt to make it to the Texas border, a sadistic sociopath Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) sets out to retrieve it, leading to a series of grisly murders. Meanwhile, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones) goes the run to investigate the increasing body count.If the violence and bloodshed don't serve as a detriment to sitting through this two-hour work of art, then you are in for beautiful ride. After all, it is the Coen Brothers behind the wheel of this cinematic endeavor. Continuing on their signature methodology of mixing violence with darky, wry humor and eccentric characters, the Coens bring a masterful sleight of hand in operating the story of a bloody cat-and-mouse game where the fate of each character is unpredictable. The biggest show stealer here is Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh, a nihilistic, violence-hungry mastermind who becomes the driving force behind the briskly paced plot. He is a man with a complex sense of morality and shows little to no mercy on anyone who crosses his path. Each second he shows up on screen, things get very suspenseful within the blink of an eye. Coming face-to-face with each individual, Chigurh has a questionable of determining their fate, and that is flipping a corn and ordering them to guess it. If the Coens prove anything, one of them is that sometimes silence can be more nerve-racking than the presence of suspenseful music. And the best part is that the film does not need an eerie music score to portray its suspense. The dialogue and Bardem's unforgettable delivery firmly gets the job done. If you find yourself laughing, the chances are it is an uncomfortable one. (And let's not forget Roger Deakins's admirable camera-work put into the mix) As for Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones, both manage to give some decent performances, the latter of whom adds a sense of dark humor to the atmosphere with his sharp dialogue. Woody Harrellson plays a small role and does a fine job, but his time on screen is rather short. Kelly MacDonald, a Scottish actress showing off with her nifty Southern accent, gives a nice portrayal as the lead character's wife. Again not too much screen time.No Country for Old Men is violent, yet masterfully crafted western thriller uprooted by the directorial talent of the Coen Brothers. It is an astounding cinematic gem that proves why the Coens are such a respected filmmaking duo. At best, it stands in the front ranks of cinematic entries of the modern western genre. As for Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones; these three deserve a round of applause.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Why doesn't anyone notice this guy.,"James Bond meets Texas Rednecks. There's this maniacal killer with a funny hair style and grim expression walking around with a gun and a tank of compressed air and either no one sees him or doesn't think to report his presence to the police. It never ceases to amaze me how quickly the local police in the Austin area where I live can come up with a suspect or make an arrest soon after a murder when there was no indication at first of who might have committed it. Yet in this movie the police are dumb or overcome with ennui or malaise that they can't capture or even track down someone who is so obviously on the loose and deadly. Especially after he killed the deputy early in the movie you'd think every cop in Texas would be on the lookout for him. So you just keep watching, wondering how dumber the people can be. And the kids: ""Hey, mister. Do you know you have a bone sticking out of your arm?"" I realize this story took place years ago before cell phones, but you'd think the kids would have thought to get someone to call for an ambulance.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"No country for happily ever after, but a great suspenseful movie, great performances.","I loved this movie. But this is not a movie for everyone, I want to be very clear about that. It is violent, it is scary, and it doesn't end with the bad guys losing and the good guys heading off to a ""happily ever after."" If you're looking for a harmless popcorn movie with comic-book violence that's so exaggerated it's unreal and a feel-good ending, be warned: ""No Country for Old Men"" is not what you're looking for.There's also no romance here, so forget it as a ""date movie;"" and while there's a certain amount of irony to it, there really isn't any humor.Which leaves: a suspenseful plot in the chase/hunt genre, some really superb acting, and everything put together in a movie that just won't quit.Plot basics: Llewelyn ""Lew"" Moss (played by Josh Brolin), a hapless regular good ol' boy in the desert southwest country, lucks into $1,000,000 in cash when he stumbles on a drug deal gone bad. He doesn't know that the guys the money belongs to tucked away a transponder in the middle of one of the bundles of cash, and that he can be located by someone who has the receiver tuned to the proper frequency who knows roughly where he may have gone.Lew and his wife Carla Jean abandon their trailer home; Carla Jean heads off to her mother's, and Lew heads off to try to figure out how to hide the loot.It's Lew's bad luck that one of the parties to the drug deal has hired Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), an executioner that's as relentless as Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Terminator"" android and is pure sociopathic killer.Chigurh (pronounced like ""sugar"") has to join the movie bad guy Hall of Fame. He simply doesn't care who he has to kill to get a job done, and when he decides he has to kill someone, he isn't going to change his mind. (This figures very prominently in the way the end of the movie plays out.) Once he knows that Lew is who he is hunting, the chase is on.Chigurh isn't just the hunter in this film; he's hunted by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the lawman in whose jurisdiction the drug deal gone bad went down. Bell quickly realizes what's going on, and unlike Lew and Carla Jean, he realizes how deadly serious the situation is. Lew knows he's being hunted, but he doesn't know how deadly the guy hunting him is; he also has a cocky belief that he's smart enough to shake off the pursuit and hang onto the cash.Bell tries to communicate with Lew through Carla Jean; he tries to get across to Carla Jean that Lew's life is in danger. Carla Jean is rattled, but she can't convince herself that shopping her husband to the law is the lesser of the evils.The hunt is on. And that's basically what the rest of the movie consists of: Lew trying to escape with the money, Chigurh (and ultimately several other parties to the drug deal) trying to hunt Lew down, and Sheriff Bell trying to get to Lew in time to save him.There's a lot of collateral damage in this hunt, and it's the way Tommy Lee Jones' Sheriff Bell is affected by the carnage that raises this movie above the level of your average hunter-and-hunted movie. Bell realizes that what he's dealing with in Chigurh, and to some extent the people who employ Chigurh, is something so far beyond the average kind of criminal he's used to dealing with that he literally cannot win. Chigurh is without any compunction: if the way to get to Lew involves killing people who are totally innocent, but whose deaths make it easier for him to get to Lew, then those people are going to die. And unlike the sheriff, who wastes time and effort in feeling something for the victims (even those who aren't completely innocent), Chigurh just mentally closes the books and moves on, the dead forgotten.Sheriff Bell realizes that however good he is at what he does, however well he does his job, he can't stop someone like Chigurh, he can't win the fight. Maybe nobody can, but for sure he can't and so it's time to step down and let someone else try.This is an excellent movie, but it doesn't spare anyone and it doesn't finish in a way that leaves you feeling good. It's unrelenting in following the story through to the bitter end. Literally the bitter end.Bardem and Jones are unforgettable; Woody Harrelson does a fine turn; Kelly Macdonald is sympathetic and completely believable as the wife who is content to let her husband make the choices for both of them...until it's too late.""No Country for Old Men"" is an excellent choice for an intense, powerful, suspenseful movie with some top-rate performances in it. But definitely not for light entertainment or easy viewing, or for people who want a happy ending.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coens deliver a great film the way only they can,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningLlewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles across some dead Mexicans, a huge stash of heroin and a load of cash. He gives in to temptation, and takes the cash, vaguely aware there may be some payback for it. He finds himself being pursued by the psychotic Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who leaves a trail of blood and destruction behind him. On both their trails is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his deputy. On the verge of retirement, Bell really is starting to lose his faith with people and the world.Although they're regarded as gold by film lovers in general, I can only remember one film of the Coens I thought was great, and that was the snow drenched Fargo. I'm sure there are many others, I've just not bothered to see them, but I have just seen this new one that makes me further of the persuasion that maybe I should see some more of their older ones. The brothers have crafted a film based around atmosphere, mood and tension, where such little things as a sweet wrapper unfolding, a tracking device beeping or a telephone ringing are given new dimensions. Some, less refined, viewers might find the film 'boring' but quite simply they don't know enough about film or what makes it an art form.Getting the style and substance of the film so right, the Coens are also treated to some brilliant performances. Bardem (could have fooled me, I thought he was Robert Downey Jr.???) is the star of the show, as a genuinely scary and unpleasant guy, who takes no nonsense, leaves bloodbaths not bodies and even has to creep people out when he's apparently just joking with them. Jones also shines as the world weary cop, who really does feel like he's about to lose his faith in human will and nature. Rising star Brolin is sadly left to basque in their greatness, alongside supporting stars Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald.Not one for those with the attention span of a knat, then, but for those who truly appreciate films and what makes them an art form, this is highly recommended. *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A great thriller and a subtle character study.,"""No country for old men"" is one of the best thrillers that I've seen in years. This is the first movie of the Coen brothers that I came upon and there's no doubt that I'll reach out for more. Their innovative writing and masterful story telling techniques has made quite an impression on me to check out their much earlier films.The story follows a poor farmer (played wonderfully by Josh Brolin) who came across a suitcase of money in a drug deal gone wrong and his struggle to steer his life away from the villainous Anton Chigur. A man with a terrifying smile, who travels across Texas, carrying a cattle gun, destroying anything that would cause him any inconvenience when it comes to acquiring the briefcase. It is hard to even imagine such a man could exist, but then again its not. This may sound as quite a simple story but then again the great masters such as Ozu and Bresson used simple stories to create innovative work. It is through their simplicity that they evoked such powerful emotions in the characters as well as in the audience. Here the Coen brothers follow the same route. It is flawlessly shot to the point that it's suspense would without a doubt hold you at the edge of the seat. The photography of the stark beautiful western landscape and creative writing are two more aspects of the film that deserves much admiration.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A masterpiece if I've ever seen one; the Coens are back in form, their best film yet","The film represents a downright uncanny application of cinematic craft on the Coen's part. They deliver storytelling in its most flawless, raw, visceral form, and indeed the film has quite the incredible story to tell, based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy (which I have intentionally put off reading in order to enjoy the film to the fullest, although I fully intend to seek it out now  by the way, if anybody hasn't read McCarthy's Pulitzer-Prize winning novel ""The Road"", do so now). But the Coens have long before transcended telling a mere plot. The film provides its best storytelling when there is no dialogue. Notice with what utter grace and absolute perfection the Coens create tension and drama. From the first moment he appears on screen, we are scared petrified of the Anton Chigurh character, and the Coens have calculated the introduction of his appearance and mannerisms so that every time he merely walks onto the screen, we get chills down our spine. Behold probably the most amazingly directed sequence of any film this year, which involves Llewelyn Moss sitting in his motel room and hearing what are clearly Chigurh's footsteps coming down the hall, until his shadow appears under the crack of the door. But if only that were all  Chigurh continues to turn off the light, drenching the scene in pitch-darkness. No other scene in any other film this year has more effortlessly created tension and true, primal fear within me as a viewer. And the scene continues, as Llewelyn apprehends a vehicle, immediately after which the windshield begins to shatter from Chigurh's shots that are being fired from who knows where, which further elevates the pressure. One of the scariest scenes in any film this year cannot be found in The Mist, or in 1408, or in any of the shock-horror pictures put out, but rather can be found right near the beginning of No Country, as the Chigurh character enters a small gas station shop and manages, without doing much at all besides playing an almost-too-calm word game with the teller, to obstinately petrify and terrorize us. I don't think a screen character has ever been depicted as more nervous than that of the store clerk in the scene in question. It is precisely these characters, such as that of the store clerk or the overweight landlady at the trailer park, that make this film so unmistakably Coen. Their mannerisms and way of talking, while not meant to be comic, are presented in an almost comic fashion. It is that unique Coen sense of humour, in which they turn the nerve-racking edginess and anxiety in the gas station scene with Chigurh into a comic moment. The Coens have an uncanny ability to create comedy simply out of the absurdity of the situation. Not a word is wasted, and every strand of dialogue, every line and passage, is absolutely and entirely pitch-perfect; it is an incredible, extraordinary screenplay.The Coens had previously reached a creative peak with Fargo, but No Country for Old Men serves as a new high for the directorial duo, and if Michelangelo can have both the Sistine Chapel and his statue of David, then surely the Coens are entitled to their two masterpieces; the classic Fargo and the modern No Country. The pieces can be further viewed as companions due to their striking similarities in terms of themes, setting and visuals; both featuring stark, horizon-reaching landscapes, regular-guy characters who get mixed up with the very wrong people, and police officers as the moral cores of the film and ultimately the central subject matter. But if Fargo delivered a more uplifting moral closure with the story of Marge Gunderson, No Country for Old Men is far more pessimistic, delivering a scathing life lesson in the depressing closure to Ed Tom Bell's tale. As in all of their films, No Country also features that very specifically Coen brothers sense of humour, which can turn even a dark and menacing dramatic thriller into a comedy by playing off the ridiculousness of the characters and the situations they get themselves into. The film also serves as a stunning, remarkable application of cinematic craft, featuring absolutely stupefying direction, cinematography, editing, production value and everything in between. Working from an utterly brilliant screenplay from the Coens, the actors deliver unnerving, compelling, show-stealing performances, in particular Tommy Lee Jones as the scarred old timer for whom this violent country is certainly no place; Josh Brolin in a brilliant lead-role debut as the naive average Joe who gets mixed in way over his head with unstoppable forces of nature; and Javier Bardem, as the ruthless, terrifying, primeval villain and embodiment of pure evil. It is a striking, epic, complex, many-leveled work of seething bleakness and stunning desolation, delivering an all-around depressing moral and human outcome. It is a movie that lives and breathes through its fascinating characters, its visceral settings, its striking visuals. It is the best film of the year, and an astounding, incredible cinematic achievement on all possible planes. The Coens have truly outdone themselves and have finally sealed their spot as one of if not the most important modern-day cinematic auteurs. May we see only work like this from them in the future  a masterpiece if I've ever seen one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A Career Best for the Coens, and the Scariest Oscar Nominee Since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS","The Coen Brothers turn back to crime in their stark, stunning, justifiably Oscar-nominated adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (NCfOM). There's a Sam Peckinpah feel to this gripping 1980-set thriller. It's a morality play and a tense suspense story rolled into one  the leaner, meaner, more vicious brother of the Coens' previous great thrillers BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO.NCfOM's protagonist is Vietnam vet Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin in a brooding, laconic, star-making performance), who goes hunting near the Rio Grande and finds himself embroiled in nightmarish mayhem and violence, Texas prairie style. Instead of bagging wild game, Llewellyn bags $2 million in drug money after stumbling across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong, complete with corpses, even a dead dog. (It's chilling to see the bodies in the process of decaying as others happen upon the scene over the course of the movie.) Llewellyn thinks he can just take off with the money, dodge whoever might come after it, and live happily ever after with his sweet wife Carla Jean (played with a letter-perfect Texas accent by winsome Scottish actress Kelly Macdonald. Brolin and Macdonald make a wryly endearing couple. The rare times Llewellyn smiles, it's usually when he's talking with Carla Jean). To his peril, Llewellyn doesn't figure on being pursued by the likes of murderous bounty hunter Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a mysterious figure with a pneumatic cattle gun, a penchant for using a coin toss to decide whether someone should live or die, and a voice that sounds like it's coming not from a human being, but from the bowels of Hell itself. Chigurh relentlessly pursues the equally dogged Llewellyn through Texas as the compassionate, sad-eyed Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones as the film's voice of reason) tries to catch up, feeling overmatched by the sheer implacable evil of the ""ghost"" that is Chigurh.The film's pacing is deliberate, but for me that simply increased the suspense as I wondered what Chigurh would do next and if Llewellyn had a chance in hell of eluding him for good, especially with his ever-increasing number of injuries. The suspense scenes are real nail-biters. There's a thrilling chase with Llewellyn pursued at night, first by a monster truck, then into the rapids by dogs. Pit bulls don't stand a chance against bullets! :-) One of my favorite scenes finds Llewellyn in his motel room in the dark. The only lights are the glowing tracking transmitter he finds in the drug money and the light under the door from the hall outside -- until a pair of feet appear on the hall side. All we hear is the transmitter...and the sound of a light bulb in the hall being unscrewed, resulting in more darkness...and I can say no more!It's a tribute to the power of Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh that his unflattering Beatles moptop-cum-Prince Valiant pageboy haircut doesn't stop him from being one of the most terrifying villains in movie history. It got so that every time Chigurh showed up, I'd watch the rest of the scene between the fingers covering my face, because I knew Bad Things Were About To Happen. Bardem's Chigurh is all the scarier because he can seem utterly calm and casual even as he blows people's brains out with that pneumatic cattle gun of his. The thing can blow out locks as well as brains, so its versatility makes up for its cumbersomeness. :-) As good as all of this year's Best Supporting Actor nominees are, I'm rooting hardest for Bardem to win the Oscar.There's some humor in the dialogue (taken mostly from the novel), but it's of the low-key, matter-of-fact variety. My favorite is the exchange between the deputy and Sheriff Bell: ""It's a mess, ain't it, Sheriff?"" ""If it ain't, it'll do till the mess gets here."" My favorite black-humored sight gag: after Chigurh launches a protracted attack in which a cop is killed, the camera pulls back to show that the floor is completely covered with scuff marks from the dead man's shoes flailing and scraping against the floor during the struggle.Be warned, NCfOM is not for the squeamish or for those who like their endings neat and tidy, with everyone getting what they deserve. Nevertheless, it still haunts me, to the point where I happily paid to see it in a theater for a second time (with relatives who were as blown away by it as I was). Could NCfOM end up being the bloodiest, most suspenseful Best Picture Oscar winner since THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS? I feel that NCfOM is not only one of the best films of 2007, but one of the best films the Coens have ever made, richly deserving its 8 Oscar nominations. It's still playing in theaters as of this writing, so by all means, get out of the house and into a theater to see it for yourself!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Best Movie of 2007,"2007 was a good year and offers many excellent films; domestic and international but among them all, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, is perhaps the best of the best. (Yes, I have seen THERE WILL BE BLOOD and loved it but due to this film having 10s in all categories, think it best).Others have already commented in great detail about the storyline so will not address other than to say it was stellar and delivered some of the most memorable one-liners of a single movie that I can easily recall. Though I will say for those who had a problem with the ending, consider seeing it again.QUESTIONABLE ENDING: The ending was brilliant. We all want to think good guys will triumph and we'll finally know more about the sociopath killers and there will be an end will be in sight but (regrettably) the older we get, the more we come to realize there is likely not going to be an end to maniacal killings, not back when, now or in the future. ""Whatever is coming is coming"" as the old man says later in the movie. It is a ghost that continues to appear time and time again despite modern technology or know how. Though we've grown accustomed to our Westerns showing the good guys winning we see a realistic, mature and modern Western through the eyes of realism an older experienced lawman who now perhaps recognizes in a dream that a father is preparing the way for him. Think about it. Coen Brothers are brilliant.SANS MUSIC: No music risky? Yes and oh what a good choice. The screenwriter is so gifted; that combined with impeccable direction, grade A actors,and camera/sound work makes the choice to forgo not only purposeful but actually intensifies the suspense.Too, one can argue that there was a natural chorus of background sounds, i.e. the wind rustling, car on gravel road, boots on pavement, gravel, the sounds that seem to echo loudly especially in tense moments. While music can be crucial to building dramatic tension it can also detract.From the very beginning we are purposefully placed, frame by frame, within the film along with the characters; we see and hear what they see and hear. Immediately we - through the passport of our senses, see and hear where we are - vast Texas country flatlands. Instead of a beautiful score to match the panoramic view we hear the beauty of a mature, older man's telling or overview of his experience and we begin to prepare ourselves for what ""might be coming"".We hear the sounds of that vastness of country road and see a cop placing a man (only a side-view of Bardem) in handcuffs in backseat of car, then in jail house seated behind him. The camera allows us to focus on conversation of the good-looking deputy in foreground and prisoner in the background with a first look at his face though not clearly the focal point. Then, within seconds we see his advancement, hear and see (from above) the look and sounds of a maniacal first and then second killing.Then shift to another countryside scene and are behind the gun focus of hunter, Josh Brolin's character, Llewelyn, who is taking aim of a deer. All we hear and see is what he hears. Wind rustling, natural sounds. He's quiet and focused. We're quiet and focused and then, BANG! No music is needed, the action, the natural noise places us squarely where the director wants us, suspensefully riding shotgun throughout the entire movie. And, it works!CAST: Stellar cast. You know it's stellar when you can't make up your mind which star shines brightest. They all do. Perhaps one of my favs was the character with so little lines, Kelly MacDonald who plays Llewelyn's wife. First, she does a killer southern accent and second, her character is completely believable and you want to see her even more. Each times she's on screen is meaningful and memorable, especially the last scene.Brolin is also entirely believable as a Texan whose Nam experience (we learn latter) prepares him for absolutely any encounter. His performance deserves nomination for best actor category. The Texas mindset, dry wit, economy of words juxtaposed to swift and decisive actions have never delivered more authentically than they do in this screenplay. Brolin, Lee et-al get it and deliver.Javier Bardem in the opening scene tells us with no words, only his action and body movements what evil looks like. He is ruthless, calculating and crazed. He's the kind of character that engenders immediate fright and respect for his ""principles"" as Harrelson describes later. We learn all of this within ONE singular frame shot (from above) in the jail cell when he is strangling the deputy. It is that camera work and focus on Bardem's facial expression (no words and no music) that says it all. This is brilliant direction and acting perfection. He also deserves nomination for best actor and is phenomenal, period!Tommy Lee Jones delivers a perfect performance. I am always in awe of his ability to develop his character. He can take any role, lead or character, and make you wait with baited breath for his return to the screen. The sheriff is perhaps my favorite character in this movie. Again, the screenwriter really understands Texan mindsets and motivations. TLJones understands it and what he does with the lines and the silence in between the lines is what translates into a winning performance and movie.CREW: Camera (incredible),Sound (especially), sets, folio, editing, costumes, etc. all impeccable and a real blend of talent.See this movie and see it again. There's so much that makes it great. It's a winner now and will no doubt become a classic. Well done!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Country is Coen's Collaboration,"The winner of 2007 Best Picture from the Academy Awards. This marked the 4th consecutive year the Oscars would put a film from modern times in the winning position. This film was from Walt Disney Co.'s Miramax and Viacom Inc.'s Paramount Vantage.

It was the Coen's first film based entirely on a novel.The Coen brothers always turn out a quality film even when sections of their films are hit and miss. For the most part the Coens have taken stories and moved in any direction that they wanted. This is the first film that has followed a novel where they were bound by the story.

The Cohen Brothers Strike Gold with another winner,"Joel and Ethan Cohen brought home the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2007 with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, a dark and chilling suspense thriller which takes the classic cat and mouse chase genre to an entirely new level.The film stars Josh Brolin, in his finest performance to date, as a schnook who happens upon the remains of a brutal crime scene, where he finds several dead bodies, a huge shipment of heroine, and a case containing two million dollars and the consequences of his fatalistic decision to take off with the money, prompting his being hunted by a cold-blooded assassin (Jarvier Bardem), who will stop at nothing to get his money back. Throw in a laid back Texan sheriff (played to perfection by Tommy Lee Jones)assigned to the case and you have all the ingredients of a first class thriller.This gritty and uncompromising drama pulls no punches and offers no easy solutions to a myriad of questions it raises, most notably, ""Did this guy really think he could get away with stealing two million dollars?""The film is dark and atmospheric, creating such a height of suspense that there is virtually no music score and you really don't miss it. The suspense created by the story propels the film itself.Jarvier Bardem won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his bone-chilling performance as Chagur, the deadly and apparently conscience-free killer chasing Brolin. Bardem creates one of the most terrifying cinematic villains ever, whose brutality is only surpassed by his unpredictability.The Cohens have crafted an intricate story that does peter out toward the end, but for the majority of its running time, will have you literally holding your breath.

No one, and I mean no one, cares how a person feels about the subject material of any movie. It's at least irrelevant and at most glaringly ignorant to even mention it. It would be like Roger Ebert reviewing ""Jaws"" by saying, ""well this was just awful. All that blood and stuff. And I don't like the idea of men fishing for sharks!"" Ludicrous.But as for the quality of this movie, the way it grabs you and then holds you for 2 hours or whatever it is on the strength of the skill with which this movie is produced, Acting doesn't get better than Bardem and Brolin and Jones and the rest of this cast, and the directing, production quality, literally every single way in which one might judge a film, couldn't be any better. It's nearly perfection from the best of the best in filmmaking.The ending? Yeah that wasn't great. Gotta work on that.

My personal pick for best movie of all time,"This movie is, by my experience, the best movie ever. That is to say, I connected to it in every facet. I love the quiet storytelling and how characters show their thinking with their actions. I love Sigur's low key menace, and how he just always feels dangerous. I very much enjoyed how the plot never quite does what you'd expect from a Hollywood movie, but still manages to be cooler than any action movie. I watched the Seventh Seal after this movie; I connected with this movie's metaphors so much more. I'm not sure if any art can be perfect, but I definitely wouldn't change a thing about this movie. That being said, I can understand how some might hate the third act, but I think the end made it more interesting. If you like a movie that you have to think about a bit at the end, then this is the ending for you!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Country For Old Men ...no place for em to be no more,"People dissing this movie with the usual gripes are totally misunderstanding it, and in the process missing something much deeper than they seek.Its Bell s story as indicated by the title, it's about humanity losing its way from the old codes of fair play and decency to choas and randam acts of cruelty and greed for the sake of it. Where old men can no longer make sense of the world, it's a changing of the guard film, and prophetic too as the world has continued to devolve down that path with the loss of order, morals to live by, the old constructs and values.Those characters around Bell are incidental players created by novelist Cormac McCarthy to give this concept ""narrative life"". The Coens did it proud.Ive watched it many times. One of my faves. The conversations between Bell and Wendell are priceless.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This is a perfect film,"There are countless reasons No Country for Old Men is a cinematic masterpiece. From the razor sharp acting (especially from Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh) to the beautifully captured cinematography, the Coen Brothers leave no room for error in their filmmaking perfectionism.Although the plot itself is fast-paced and shockingly violent, the lack of a musical score coupled with the serene backdrop of rural Texas gives the film a serene calmness unlike any predecessor. The film's setting beautifully epitomizes the barren hopelessness of life in a world fallen into deep moral decline. The certainty of uncompromising death is around the corner at every turn.The film is ultimately about the inevitability of death. In No Country for Old Men, the good guy vs bad guy setup is completely reimagined under the scope of logic and realism. Characters don't make stupid mistakes in this film and pay for it. The protagonist is a smart capable individual who makes smart tactical decisions, but the villain is smarter. Bystanders get caught up in the violence for no reason.Life isn't fair, death doesn't play fair, and it doesn't matter how logical or smart you are in the face of pure evil.

MY MASTERPIECE,"This movie in my opinion is the definition of underrated simply put a story. That's kind of basic, but doesn't feel that way because the execution is delightful. First off the performances are really really top-notch especially Javier Bardem. He is such a psychopath. He is such a creature that you don't even want to look at or think about, Anton might possibly One of the best villains of all time, because he don't have to have no make up no superpowers no tape or anything the only thing that you see is this man's hair, because this man's hair does not fit him at all, but it feels right, because His character does not feel like he's a part of this earth, Josh Brolin put in a Very neat performance, and the same goes with Tommy Lee Jones and I love the fact that this movie does not have no soundtrack the only soundtrack is nature(wind). Each scene is tension after tension after tension because this film does not have no brakes each character especially Javier. Bardem character has a motive that's more relatable incense if you were a hitman, this is definitely a rewatch film to me because in my opinion, there's nothing wrong or no flaws in this movie except for some pacing issues but that's just for someone to nitpick Overall a masterpiece in my opinion, and something that filmmakers Directors and writer should learn from this film. This was a very neat movie. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A movie that's all country which rocks and rolls,"This is a thoroughly entertaining movie you must put on your bucket list, with one of the most scariest performances from a great actor you'll ever see. The Coen Brothers have done it again with a great structured story. Although the plot is nothing new, it's the way this story is told, only enhanced by the great performance of Bardem as a psychotic contract killer, and I really mean psychotic. Escaping from police, he's after a suitcase of cash, in the wake of a drug buy that's gone wrong, out there in the country, that's left a score of guys dead. Unfortunately, but more unfortunate for Brolin, he's found the money and taken off with it, which again shows stolen moolah is blood moolah. This engrossing film from start to finish has it all, including some great comedy moments, one a trademark one, worth all it's amount in coin. There are some other great performances, notably, Tommy Lee Jones as a cynical and aging old sheriff. The scenes with him are gold, proving he's one of the greatest actors out there. Kelly Macdonald is really good as Brolin's nagging wife, who I must admit, I didn't realize at first. The ending is pretty grim, where seeing bones broken like in the Straw Dogs remake, makes me squirm a little. Too, for the viewer, nearing it's end, a ""Did he shoot her or not"" moment, which would of left a few movie goers ruminating, moments after seeing it. I believe the Coen brothers are incapable of making a bad movie, where to me, nothing they've done would score lower than an 8. This is one of those films, which I secretly refer to as movie candy. I could watch many times, and never be bored. Even the title is great, in a can't take your eyes off the screen movie. One criticism though was how Brolin was able to outrun that pick up truck of bad dudes, after he returned with that canteen of water, but hey all is forgiven.

Bad.  Very bad.  Bad men and a story line that was worse than bad.,"I am easy to please when it comes to movies but my wife and I came away from this one looking for someone in management to ask for our money back. On the pro side it started out and pretty much developed as a good story line and it had some good acting talent. Bad men. Moral issues. Tommy Lee Jones was on his way to a good film and then the script failed him and he just rolled over, so I guess he needed the money. I like Tommy Lee but this was his worst effort. The best acting in this otherwise awful movie was the baddest of the bad guys who is an actor most of us have not seen before. Javier Bardem's character will make you want to sleep with a loaded shotgun in your bed tonight. Overall the movie started out with basically good underpinnings.... and kept you interested for almost 2 hours.... and then it all fell apart in the last 5 minutes. An absolutely horrible ending. I only hope that Javier Bardem is out looking for the Coens so he can blast them like his other targets!

No country for westerns.,"When it comes to films and cinema in general, I can't recall many pictures that felt and seemed more tense than No Country for Old Men, Coen brothers' 2007 output. It's curious though that a nihilist film, in which its villain kills by a simple coin toss or for the most trivial reasons, can be this much serious in tone and in atmosphere. Multiple times during the pursuit between Moss and Chigurh, I was genuinely scared, wishing things would somehow turn into his favor.No Country is about the inability of the elderly to keep up with the excess of violence practiced, leaving them no choice but to self-retire. It's also a western, a genre that was fairly popular in the last century, but was put to sleep by the rapid change of our universe. Anton Chigurh is basically what technology is to western genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
it didn't convince me as I expected,"From ""No Country for Old Men"" I expected much more. On this film I have always read a great word of mouth and very high ratings and is defined as a movie. Honestly, in my opinion, this is just a good thriller film with an incredible antagonist that drags the whole film along. The film becomes beautiful only for its presence, in scenes where there are only other characters...there is nothing exciting. Anton Chigurg is so amazing for the great performance of Javier Bardem. The other characters are discreet, they are not well-researched. The other actors were convincing but unfortunately some had a horrible Italian voice actor. The plot is good but I wasn't very curious. The Coen's direction is good and it's great for the genre. The writing of the film is not enveloping and I have not been able to explain well since the beginning the various characters: you see just the fact of wanting to focus only on so much blood and an excellent antagonist. The setting is well chosen and is one of the movie's highlights. The CGI is great and at times looked like real blood. The rhythm of the film is only good because Anton Chigurg is present in most scenes and makes you stay on track and in suspense. The ending of the film didn't convince me, I would have liked a more raw and decided ending like the whole film. I don't have many words to spend on this film but I can't say it's not good..
Rating: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I found it riveting!,"I wasn't intending to write a review, but I'm shocked at the number of 1s I see. The primary point of a film is enjoyment and I felt this film delivered. I watched it on my laptop as I often do but unlike many films I had no desire to check emails or search google during slow parts. The film completely captured my attention.The 80s setting I think helps with realism as the technology wasn't quite there to quickly track criminals like there is today. Very little nostalgia though as the film is indicating that the early 80s was a time of ruthless criminals he seemed to do things for no reason other than cruelty.The film kind of has a 70s feel to it as far as the way they made films slower back then and with less predictable conclusions, but a modern person shouldn't have too much trouble with it as the film gets right into things in the first five minutes and we know who the good and bad guys are, we just don't know what will happen to them.I don't feel the need to run through the plot, seeing it is better, but I will address the main villain to head off any possible dissapointments. He is not the Terminator which I think is a strength of the movie. Someone on youtube who can mimick voices redid a key scene using Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice instead of the featured actor. While the Schwarzenegger voice is more threatening, the scene comes off as less compelling because it is obvious to the viewer who this person is, while with the original voice, things are more unclear. Is he just messing with this guy, is he planning to kill him, is he easily annoyed...we just aren't sure. And you will never be sure how the villain will react in a given situation and whether or not he will be successful. A lot of action movies turn all their heroes into Superman which is great for Superman but doesn't work so well when the villain is a mortal.If you want everything explained to you and all loose ends tied, this may not be the film for you. On the other hand it isn't an art film either and although you could certainly write a college paper on what the film says about the meaning of life, it would be a bit of a stretch. Basically, entertainment which demands a bit of thinking which I think is just right for most films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Coen brothers at their awesome,"I see several comments about the movie not being ""understandable"" and the plot not ""unfolding smoothly"". I suppose you have to have an understanding of the Coen brothers genre to be able to more thoroughly enjoy this movie. If you want a realistic and slyly humorous portrayal of the crooked, violent and rapacious animals that humans are, then Coen brothers movie is what you want to watch.I have not read McCarthy's book so the opening scenes of the movie were a great treat. Though I had guessed how the hunt for the money was going to end soon after Llewellyn found it, the movie kept me guessing with the many unpredictable turns and twists. It was like a river flowing down a crooked mountain. You knew the water was surely flowing down but at each turn you could only see as far as the next turn and the next turn, when it came, was always a surprise. All the characters were extremely well played by the wonderful cast. Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones all did a wonderful job.

I don't understand why they did it.,"I'm a Coen Brother's fan and I went in with very high hopes. What with the people that matter calling this their best offering in years, some going so far as to call it their best ever. That's reason enough for me to shell out the $11.50. Something I do less and less these days. Do I think I got my money's worth? Yes and no. For the first hour and change I was treated to a first rate thriller with grand, Sam Shepard's America type themes, a lot like Blood Simple actually. And I, the eager film goer, became immersed, developed a fondness and then considerable concern for the guy I took to be the protagonist. Then with less that a half hour to go, they did the darndest thing. They dipped out of my hero's story, at the climax of all places..in an edit that looked and felt like a bad projectionist had just changed reels. It was, as I've read here and elsewhere, a move in keeping with the style of the novel. The choice to tell the story in this way was apparently one of those form equals theme moves like Beckett's Waiting For Godot. I spent the better part of an hour chewing it over with my girlfriend. We're not the sharpest knives in the drawer for sure, so maybe a second viewing will give me something more to hold on to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A highly-crafted film, but not for people triggered by graphic violence","It's a criminal chase film set in 1980 in the West Texas hinterlands. It follows three main characters--a local Vietnam vet who discovers a drug deal gone bad in the desert and takes the money, a psychopathic killer hired initially to recover the money, and the older sheriff trying to work out the mass of murders taking place in his usually sleepy region.The film opens with some reflections on his career by Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). He's been a lawman since he was 25, as was his father, grandfather, and uncle. We then meet Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), the psychopath, as he kills a deputy sheriff with his handcuffs. However, we never learn why he was initially arrested. Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is the local Vietnam vet who lives in a trailer with his wife, Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald). He discovers $2.0 million in drug money in the desert but soon learns the drug lords are after him.The story then follows the mutual chases--Chigurh after Moss and Bell trying to catch up with Chigurh and Moss. There is a lot of graphic violence along the way, and many folks will find the ending unsatisfactory.In some ways, this is a straightforward chase movie with many bodies. The skill of the Coen brothers in cinematic details and their attention to the West Texas setting set it apart. Tommy Lee Jones is magnificent as an aging lawman with 40 years of experience who is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the evil he is facing. Brolin is excellent as the loner vet who believes his survival in Vietnam means he'll be able to protect Carla Jean and handle Chigurh. Bardem is a believable psychopath, though that doesn't require much emotional range. There's also a cameo appearance by Woody Harrelson that seems designed only to show how skilled a killer Anton Chigurh is.""No Country for Old Men"" is a highly-crafted film, but not for people triggered by graphic violence.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

3/4 a masterpiece...,"Based on the novel of the same name, No Country for Old Men follows Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) who comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong. With everyone dead and the drugs and money just sat there for the taking, the temptation is too much and Moss takes the cash and goes on the run. Hot on his tail is ruthless killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who very much would like that money back and will happily kill anyone who gets in his way. And tailing HIM is sheriff Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who realises the situation and hopes to stop it before the piles of bodies increase any more.I have to say, this film is pretty awesome. The story is engaging, with war vet Moss doing everything in his power to stay one step ahead of the deadly Chigurh. The performances are great, in particular Javier Bardem - who is completely convincing as the intimidating yet ice cold killer. You end up genuinely rooting for Moss as he escapes time and time again by the skin of his teeth, and if it wasn't for the... well frankly a bit crap ending this would have been a masterpiece.

A fine and excellent thriller,"Rating-8/10No Country for Old Men is a film which manages to mix Drama, Crime and Thrilling moments to create a film with no boundaries and is not afraid to be slow and cautious to be good drama. Yet another film created by a brotherly duo who it is safe to say are some of the best around in the film industry Directing and Writing wise and never seem to make films that are not at the very least good films. I personally felt that this film was firmly an excellent film and here below is why.The story is as I say slow but with it's plot slowly seeping through to us the viewer, we are left with a thrilling film that can put us on the edge of our seats but at the same time leave us feeling something different for each and every character. With this movie you also get the scary personality of the basic villain but with no main character either it leaves us thinking who in the end won the game in this movie, and who lost, I think to be fair, that is for you to decide because no clear indications are ever given.The real star of this is of course Javier Bardem who's hauntingly brilliant portrayal of hit man Chigurgh is both well acted and well written in, and with even his hair style making him seem more evil, Bardem controls all aspects of this film. Josh Brolin as the character we could possibly consider the main character does a good job and seems courageous but slightly scared in this dark role Brolin takes on. The rest of the follow up cast such as Tommy Lee Jones do a good job and Jones in particular although I would have like to have seen more of him, he manages to create a man who just understands all to well about human nature.The Coen Brothers are of the course the main men behind this excellent production and direct and write this as well if the best they have ever done in there movie career. With a script that delves right into the heart of the characters, I felt that was one of the biggest positivity's in this film and created a film you couldn't not listen too. Even when the film gets slow the Brothers somehow manage to make this entertaining and bring to the party all there skills they have learnt previously in film, with a dabble of even comedy in certain parts which make the films characters almost insane.I felt although very little criticism should be aimed at this, the film never reaches the heights of being superb or anywhere near sublime as the story is a good one but I did feel it wasn't that smart and the Coen Brothers can make stories much more complex than this. The film is at parts very slow and with so much dialogue used at certain times, I would forgive people who disliked this because of that point, the film also lacks a climatic kind of feel and it ends with you thinking possibly, just possibly ""is that it"".Those who love the brothers work should love this too as although it may lack the smart angle I was saying about, it still boats magnificent acting and a thrilling plot which is also very good drama too. People who like basic dramas should also like this but the same goes for those looking for big loud film, stay away, people in this aren't killed just to entertain you they are part of the intricate plot and no one is deemed safe at all. I would also say if any people like watching films that did well at the Oscars this is one and it is a good mix of what all Oscar movies seem to have in them.Overall I give it an 8/10, a Firmly Great movie which although doesn't warrant a moving up in rating, can I feel from you the audience be loved even more so than my rating and review. With the Coen Brothers they have made film that are brilliant, and after watching this I just thought ""keep making more exquisite films guys"" and so should you as I really do believe there are so many films they have made, it would be impossible for everyone to at least like one of them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Gritty and thrilling,"I was 7 when it was made, so obviously didn't watch it when it came out. My dad highly recommended it to me as he had enjoyed it so much, so we watched it together recently. I was taken aback by how much it captivated me, despite it not being my usual type of film.The brooding and gritty style of the movie kept the tension going throughout, and the protagonist was the bad guy, which left me with the mixed emotions of trying to see things from his psycho point of view whilst also dreading his next murderous act. It gave an unsettling insight into the mind of a killer, but didn't do so in a way that forced your hand into sympathising with him.The entire film was intense from start to finish, with the lead actor doing a fantastic job of portraying a man with no regard for others. His poker face expression and total lack of emotion is what gives this movie the status of a classic.

Why don't we just not end the picture and say we did?,"I paused it and I went to eat dinner.After seeing the first half of this film, I began to praise it. With tremendous efforts from Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones, I thought I was settling into a memorable picture. Even the Oscar winning mommas boy, Javier Bardem, was giving everything he had. (Who is this guy again and why do I care?) The cinematography was beautiful. The drama was wonderful, building excitement with every minute. All was falling into place.Then I turned it back on.Big mistake. I should have thrown my Blu-ray player out the window. It should have froze up on me again.

I've just watch ,,No Country for Old Man'' and it is exactly as much thoughful. I feel like every scene has it's meaning and it's beautifully shot by Roger Deakins. Javier Bardem performance is one of the best one in history. Josh Brolin is good, Woody Harleson is astonishing given by his small role. Anyway if you not seen you must see.

A thought-provoking masterpiece.,"The matter I like the most in Coens' works is how they inject so many ideas and philosophy into simple things. I think that's the main cause of Coens' genius and oneness.No Country for Old Men is one of those Coens' movies, which leaves you thinking for a long time after the movie has ended. There are so many themes and philosophy to interpret that you couldn't even notice a half of them during the first time of watching. Personally I'm watching this piece the 3rd time and still finding a lot of new ideas to contemplate, that's the aspect i like the most in this movie.Worth to mention that this masterful work couldn't be done without perfectly developed characters and flawless dialogs. Big praises to cinematographers also.Finally, everything adds up to one word, best defining this work of art - Masterpiece.Best Coens' work so far. Absolute 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Very Unique Experience,"I have watched quite a few movies in my lifetime so far, but after viewing ""No Country For Old Men"" I can honestly say that I haven't really seen too many like this before.For a basic plot summary, this film begins by introducing ruthless killer Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a man the likes of which Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) cannot even comprehend. When Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds a briefcase full of money meant for Chigurh, it kicks off a tense chase between all three parties.The reason ""No Country For Old Men"" is such a solid film is because it is so deep on a number of different yellows. All three main characters are interesting and make you truly care (one way or another) about their actions, especially the viciousness of Anton (that is probably the one aspect of the movie I will always remember).Despite the fact that this is a very deep, thought-provoking movie, it is also quite sparse and terse (perhaps more sparse than any movie I've ever seen). There is no dramatic music (no contrived drama whatsoever, to be honest), no montage sequences, no character flashbacks, or any bells-and-whistles. It is completely ""straight down the line"", so to speak. If you are a fan of that type of stark filmmaking, this will be one of your all-time favorite.All told, I enjoyed watching this movie for the amount of themes it threw at me and particularly the way it portrayed the ""new type of killer"" in the modern world (even in the more traditional Texas). I prefer a movie with a little more obvious drama, so no five stars from me, but other than that I would recommend this to any fan of interesting cinema that does not conform to any other standard but its own.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Masterpiece,"""No Country for Old Men"" (2007) is a riveting neo-Western thriller directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same name. Set along the Texas-Mexico border in 1980, the film follows the interwoven lives of three men: Llewelyn Moss, a Vietnam War veteran who stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong; Anton Chigurh, a relentless and enigmatic hitman pursuing a cache of stolen money; and Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, a seasoned lawman struggling to come to terms with the changing nature of crime and violence in the modern world.The Coen Brothers' masterful direction, coupled with Roger Deakins' stunning cinematography, creates a bleak and atmospheric landscape that mirrors the moral ambiguity and existential themes of McCarthy's novel. The film's sparse dialogue, punctuated by moments of intense violence and suspense, adds to its tension and realism.The performances are exceptional across the board, with Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones delivering nuanced and unforgettable portrayals of their respective characters. Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh, in particular, is chilling and mesmerizing, earning him an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.""No Country for Old Men"" is more than just a crime thriller; it's a meditation on fate, morality, and the inexorable passage of time. With its haunting imagery, complex characters, and gripping narrative, the film stands as one of the Coen Brothers' crowning achievements and a timeless masterpiece of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Cleaning up pieces of brain and skull around theater after my head exploded,"Amazing acting, cinematography, sound, and plot development. This movie has it all going off. Drink it like a 25 year Scotch. Slow and deliberate. It's not so much about finishing it as it is enjoying the tastes, smells, sounds, and sights along the way. Can't wait to watch it again. It comes at a time where Hollywood is content soaking us in a stagnant pool of mediocrity. Breath in this fresh air people, take comfort in the fact that there are still those out there that care deeply about making great films. The Coens use of lesser known actors for pivotal roles can only attest to their vision. Big name actors playing leads can often be the Achilles heel of a potentially epic film. Past performances have a way of bleeding into the project. The Coen brothers tread carefully here ensuring that no compromises are made in the telling of this griping story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Call it, Friendo!","Happy birthday Javier Bardem. No Country for Old Men based on the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy and directed by the Coen brothers is not just the best thriller ever made, it is one of the greatest movies ever made and one of my Top 10 favorites. It's so simple yet so effective.The premise is basically a cat and mouse game between Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a man who accidentally finds a load of cash from a failed drug deal, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a professional hitman with the wildest hair cut out there, soon to be retired sherrif Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who basically is the titular old men and the mexican gang that screwed up the deal. They all either want the money or Moss, death or alive.Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh is the true standout. He portrays the character so perfectly and so menacing making him feel like a mix between an criminal and a slasher villain. His unique look (mostly the previously mentioned haircut), the weapons he uses (a captive bolt gun which helps him to unlock every lock and a shotgun with once again the most exaggerating silencer you'll ever seen) along with Bardems portrayel make him one of the greatest movie characters of all time. He isn't just a mindless killer that is after some cash, there is some philosophy in his doing. The other actors also do a really great job.The movie doesn't have much of a soundtrack but this is still a contributer to the movies atmosphere. There are plenty of standout scenes, be it the motel shootouts or the iconic coin toss scene that might be a contender for Top 3 greatest movie scenes of all time. I just have to say it again, this is one of the greatest films ever made. From an simple yet engaging story, well executed moments and an iconic villain this movie got it all. A little bit of a slasher, a bit of a modern western, some drama, some action and some crime that Grand Theft Auto could have gotten some inspiration... oh wait. This is not just the greatest thriller but a perfect genre mix. Some romance is missing though.10/10 Coin Tosses.... Friendo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A visual pleasing movie,"Watched ""No country for old men"" today and i would say that it's the most scariest movie i have ever watched. A game of rat and mouse so interesting and i love the fact that there is no music in the movie, the characters were so smart instead of stupid. The jumpscares are so unexpected and because of the high noise you just jump out of fear, not expecting it. Kinda sad when a certain character died, happened off-screen which is interesting to see nonetheless.The constant fear in the movie makes you wonder how the scene is gonna end, a constant thrill of horror and unexpected moments.

"A Realistic, Dark & Violent Movie","No country for old men is a long movie made by Coen Brothers and its story is based on a book which its name is the same as the movie's name and it's written by Cormac Mc Carthy.The story is not a complicated one and I'll try to tell a bit about it without spoiling anything , a drug deal goes wrong, drug dealers kill each other, one of them escapes with 2 million dollars but he dies...
Another man who is a hunter and was a former soldier accidentally finds the money and he takes it for himself but then he finds out that a killer is after him and his money and he's going to kill everyone who stands in his way...
And there's a sheriff in this story who's the narrator...
The important thing about the movie is, unlike its simple storyline this movie has a lot of concepts that we can talk a lot about them; like the way that violence is growing in society, the personality of the killer which reminds me of the Joker character and a lot more things; I personally believe showing these details in the movie made No country for old men a perfect movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who like movies from this genre.In the end, thanks for reading my review.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Welcome to the Existentialist West,"I had no idea just how dark this film would be. I knew that the Coen Brothers could do dark, but nothing quite like this. But perhaps what separates this film from so many of their other great films, is how detailed and symbolic this movie is from start to finish. Every scene has a symbolic message. trust me, you will be thinking about this film for sometime after you leave the theater. Everybody saw the Bardem character in the ads, including his Prince Valiant haircut and odd weapon of choice, and were drawn to the film. Well, Bardem does not disappoint, he is incredible. Bardem's character is a principled killer with a code. Yes, he is insane, but he has rules he lives by and this is what keeps him going in an otherwise cruel and pointless world. He detests those that refuse to take life by the horns and instead settle for what is in store for them. To Bardem's character, everything is for a reason, because if it is not, what is the point. The good guys in the film are perhaps not as structured as Bardem, or are they as goal oriented. Brolin is incredible as a good ol' boy who has no idea what he has stepped into. Jones is his incredible self, playing an aging Sheriff that has hoped that God would have revealed himself to him already, but sadly, has not. He has trouble grasping the changes that he is seeing as he approaches retirement. You spend your whole life trying to create a sane and civilized society, and then you see, things are worse off than when you started. Jones has a terrific quote when he is talking to another aging Sheriff that is dumbfounded by this new generation, Jones says that ""when you stop hearing Sir and Mam and the end of sentences, trouble cannot be far behind."" Well, trouble is coming, and the times are changing, for the worse, and nothing gets better, and this is not a country for old men.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Coen Bros never cease to amaze,"Similar to the comments made by many others here who like the body of work by the brothers Coen, No Country for Old Men is an excellent addition. It is one of those rare movies that I dwell on for days, thinking back on the movie and further contemplating what I experienced: the breath taking imagery, the dialog, the way the scene was filmed, etc. It was a movie that dazzled the senses and engrossed the intellect.There are ample areas that could be discussed as to why this is flick is getting such high ratings here on the IMDb (I give it 10 out of 10, and there are very few movies that I would rate as such). As I have read the comments, many of them seem to be for all the right reasons. In summary: -TLJ certainly provided probably his best work ever as a supporting actor -Javier Bardem (who?) portrayed a most vile yet mesmerizing and memorable psychopath -Josh Brolin gave a solid performance as a man who only wanted to improve his lot in the world -Sensational supporting cast -The score (or lack thereof) was brilliantly woven into the story that unfolded -The imagery that we all come to expect from the Coen's -Oscar nominations for both Coen brothersHowever, one thing that I keep dwelling upon that I have not yet seen comments about is the randomness that permeated every aspect of this movie. True, the violence certainly had an in your face random quality throughout, but many parts of life seemed to have a random quality to it as well. One is left to wonder just how much of life is random, ranging from the joys and positive experiences we all encounter to the absolute horror that would possibly be experienced if such violence were to be thrust upon us.Certainly No Country For Old Men will also stand the test of time, it will for me at any rate. That translates into making the short list of Must See Classics; which means I'll buy it and watch many more times for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A very good riveting movie,"No Country For Old Men was such an awesome movie. The whole movie was great up until the very end. It started out so great and then got pretty bad at the end. Some of the scenes in it were very surprising. I didn't see some of the stuff in the movie coming. This movie was actually suspenseful. All of a sudden you are just watching and then the next the killer just pops out of no where. Javier Bardem was the perfect actor for this film. He looked just like a killer should, red eyed and creepy. Tommy Lee Jones although he was a supporting actor. He still played a good part and gave the movie more information. The action started out at the beginning and went until the end. The whole entire movie it kept me on the edge of my seat. Josh Brolin did an amazing job playing a man who finds two million dollars. After he finds the money he is chased down by many different people also searching for the money. I am not surprised that this movie won so many academy awards. Especially for the acting. Overall this was a very very good movie. That should be seen by anyone who likes western, action, or drama movies. I promise you will like this movie, after all look at all the other reviews. One more thing about the acting it was just amazing, I can say that over and over again. Especially Javier Bardems character. They needed him to look as scary as possible and they did. He was very scary looking to me. He is one guy I wouldn't want to meet. Their was also a lot of bloody violence. So if you want blood and violence this was great for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
So good . . . to end so badly!,"I was really looking forward to this film due to reviews I'd read and score it has on IMDb. I trust IMDb users and I'm usually not disappointed.I was, however, extremely disappointed with this film.I thought it started very well with explosive action and then some intrigue, unexplained deaths and a man trying to escape a serial killer! So, good start.However, as the film progressed it started to deteriorate. Firstly, I failed to see the point or relevance of Tommy Lee-Jones' character in the film. He had no influence on the plot whatsoever (and I know a lot of people will say that that was the point - I mean the film was NAMED after his character!) - BUT, his character was so uncompelling and character-less that I really couldn't have cared less about him.The ending of the film was a complete travesty! I won't spoil it for those who are yet to see it - but it is completely unfulfilling and is a 'non-ending.' Anyway, my conclusion is that there were some great scenes, some good bits of acting, the killer had good dialogue, and there was some intrigue - but it was boring and over drawn-out in places, Tommy Lee-Jones' character was a completely uninspiring and unnecessary third wheel, and the ending was so diabolically unfulfilling that it turned what could have been a great film into and bang-average film to me.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Western is most certainly not dead,"Cormac McCarthy finally gets a movie worthy of him. Astonishing performances (esp. from Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem) and absolutely masterful cinematography mix with a deceptively simple narrative. Indeed, Bardem at times reaches the level of Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in his character's creepiness. This film is like a much blacker Fargo. The Coens wonderfully use Texan slang (""It's a mess, ain't it?"" asks one character, to which Tommy Lee Jones' replies ""If it ain't, it'll do till the real one gets here."") for various purposes--building tension, playing with ideas, relieving tension.McCarthy's recurring question, which was front and center in All The Pretty Horses-- is there such a thing as a meaningful code of honour?-- is tossed around, sometimes casually, sometimes horrifically. His deeper concern-- a mythic interest in what we might call karma, or the inescapable balancing act the Universe makes, or the relentless absurdist logic of obligation-- unfolds through various kinds of horror.The film's only weak point is its occasional moralising speeches. It is as if the Brothers worried-- as did Coleridge of his speaker's impact int he Rime of the Ancient Mariner, a poem with more than a few similarities to this film-- that the sheer power of their story would overwhelm its moral concerns. But ultimately this is the Coens at their best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Well-crafted, but...","It seems that every single Coen brothers movie is going to be well-received by critics...have they ever been rated poorly? Accordingly, I go to the movies, but I know I may not like it very much. I respect the Coens, and I admire that they try to make so many different kinds of films. This is a very well-crafted film, and at this point, I think Bardem deserves the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. That being said, the film was excruciatingly slow at many points, and simply lacked any soul.I tend to like their movies with humor, such as Fargo and Raisin' Arizona, but even that doesn't guarantee a good film (I hated O'Brother and Ladykillers). Their more serious films are technically very well-done, but usually lack any soul.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Masterful Exercise in Tension,"I just saw ""No Country for Old Men"", on its opening night at my local art-house theater, in a packed audience. I'm still trying to find words to describe it. Yes, the film is THAT good, everything you've heard about it is true (I was afraid I was going to be disappointed, which often happens when you go see a film that's been almost universally acclaimed). I'm not sure this is the Coen Brothers' masterpiece (only future viewings will tell me that), but it stands with ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" and ""Fargo"" as my favourite piece from Joel & Ethan.This is one of the scariest films I've ever seen, and I'm not easily scared. I mean, I'm not scared by over the top, teen serial killer flicks; believable characters and palpable situations are what really give me the chills (hence ""Dogville"" and ""Heavenly Creatures"" being some of the scariest films I've seen). ""No Country for Old Men"" could be a male variation of Hitchcock's classic ""Psycho"": substitute the naive young secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) for a fearless hunter (Josh Brolin, never better), and the introspective motel owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), for a brutal killing machine (Javier Bardem), and give it an ""A Simple Plan"" (an underrated gem directed by Sam Raimi in 1998) web of 'hickey' characters, and you've got a devastating tale of moral values, choices - and the price we pay for them. Describing this film in details would spoil the experience (the ending is love-it or hate-it as no other I've seen in a long time, and it'll be an infinite topic for discussion). Javier Bardem's Anton Chigurh might be the scariest villain I've ever seen, and I dare to say, it will (or at least should) be ranked alongside other classic names such as the cited Norman Bates, Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs"") and Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates in ""Misery""). You could hear the entire audience's breathing every time he was on screen. An old lady who was sitting beside me literally jumped a couple of times. This powerful role and incredible performance should give Bardem his much deserved Oscar next year (he also should've won for ""Before Night Falls"" 7 years ago). But everybody in the cast (Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones, Kelly Macdonald and Woody Harrelson) is top-notch, and it would be unfair to give credit only to Bardem. After two disappointing features (""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""The Ladykillers"", easily the worst of their career), the Coens directed an amusing segment for ""Paris, Je t'Aime"" last year, and had a terrific comeback with this instant classic ""No Country for Old Men"". Welcome back to form, Joel & Ethan! 23 years after ""Blood Simple"", you still got the power to amaze us. 10/10.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""No Country"" is No Country for the Unallegorical","Americans watch American movies expecting to see tried-and-true American themes of criminality punished by good ol' American violence, our overwhelming preference for solving all of the world's ill, even when it usually doesn't. So along comes this faithful (so I'm told) adaptation of the McCarthy book by the same title, which on the surface doesn't seem to have anything to do with the film (the title comes for a poem called ""Sailing to Byzantium."") But if one looks at the movie as the ancient Greek philosophers would have, then maybe everything makes a great deal more sense. Take the title. The movie starts with a voice-over narration by the Tommy Lee Jones character, an old school lawman in West Texas, who tells us he comes from a long lineage of Lone Star justice enforcers. He lets us know quickly that the new breed of criminal, motivated by drug-fueled greed and remorseless mayhem, bewilders him. This New Country is No Country for this Old Man. He is an outsider looking in, and throughout the whole movie he is always a step behind the main protagonists, the younger generation personified by Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem. These are men for whom the 1980s Reaganite mantra of money at any cost will be drowned out by the drug wars, the contra wars, and the Greed is Good ethos of an unrestrained and predatory Wall Street. Brolin, a white trailer trash welder, finds himself the only man standing amidst a scene of drug sale gone bad carnage. He callously ignores a dying Mexican's request for water while searching for the cash he suspects motivated this desert shootout. When he finds it, he returns home, and that, in the real world, would be that. He and his cute country girl wife would party lifelong in Tahiti with their sudden wealth. But no, this is a Greek story, and the Greeks would make man do things for the pleasure of the Gods, like get up in the middle of the night, pierced with guilt, to take water to that now long dead Mexican who he wouldn't give the time of day to just hours ago. In any case, that questionable decision sets off a chain of events that should have been the segue for introducing the Bardem character, the chilling menace of Anton Chuigich, who must join the ranks of Hollywood's all time great villains. But we meet Anton in the first scenes of the movie, before Brolin's discovery, being arrested by some highway patrolman who confidently trots him to jail, only to be strangled like some country chicken on the waxed floors of the police station. We see that Anton likes killing, indeed, it seems to be the only time he's really alive. He kills the people who hire him to find the stolen cash simply because they hired him, and must be worthy of extinction for that reason alone. Others he gives a fighting chance. He asks a gas station attendant to call a coin toss, without telling him that his life depends on the call. The symbolism seems clear to me. Chuigich's concern for money only devolves around that small piece of metallic coin, and he tells that attendant his whole life has come to this random chance meeting and this random chance coin flip, a cosmic convergence around an otherwise meaningless medium of monetary exchange. When the attendant makes the life saving call, Antion urges him to keep that coin separate from the other coins, lest it revert to what it was and is, useless lifeless money. And he understands that God is a Random deity, at least from a a mortal's perspective; everyone's going to die anyway. Does it matter if that's decided by a coin toss or a traffic accident? He murders bad people without the lottery of gravity tugged metal because their end was predetermined by their knowledge of him. Probably most disappointing to many was the ending, which did not have Chuigich being arch typically killed by lawman Tommy Lee. The last scene shows Tommy Lee recounting a dream he had of his father, who tries to impart some wisdom to his son before this No Country for Old Men reality interrupts. There is no bloodbath, no retribution, no hail of bullets with a blonde hanging off his arm. Tommy Lee is alone and he knows it, alone in a random world where justice appears like a black wrath with a bad haircut that no one really wants to stop. Is this a great film? No, I can't rate it that highly, though Bardem's performance is riveting and certainly in the Anthony Hopkins-Hannibal Lector ranking of malevolencies on screen. But the direction was taut, the photography gripping and the story, if one divests themselves of American prejudices of what film-making should be, a morality tale worthy of Olympus. But I would liked to have had more focus on these themes, actually a longer film to be honest, and more of the Harrelson character involved instead of making a brief appearance and then getting killed. Still, it's one of the better films down the pike for a while.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A Minor American Classic, Friendo","""No Country for Old Men,"" the Coen brothers' screen adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's nailbiter of a novel, is doggedly faithful to its source, which will please fans of the book, but which is also what limits it from achieving greatness. As it is, the movie will probably and deservedly be remembered as a minor classic, but that's due more to its execution than it is its subject matter. It's as accomplished as ""Fargo,"" still the Coens' best movie in my opinion, but it doesn't carry a powerful message the way that film did, or have any characters who make a lasting impression.Josh Brolin plays a Vietnam veteran living in Texas sometime in the early 1980s who comes across a satchel of money ($2 million to be exact) at the scene of a drug deal gone bad. He takes off with it, his arrogance leading him to believe that he will be able to outsmart whoever comes looking for it. Who comes looking for it is Anton Chigurgh, a relentless psycho who's as untraceable as he is unstoppable (played by Javier Bardem). Tommy Lee Jones plays sheriff Ed Tom Bell, who provides the film with a voice over narration in which he laments the state of the world and the awful nature of crime in his day as compared to those of his dad and granddad, both sheriffs before him. In McCarthy's novel, all of this is told in clipped and deadly serious language, and it all feels more full of philosophical import than it is; it's not until you've put the book down and start thinking about it that you realize how lightweight it is. I was interested to see if the Coens would bring any depth to the material that wasn't inherently there. They don't. Therefore, the movie is supremely engrossing and suspenseful, and I hung on every scene and image they put on the screen, but it didn't feel like an important movie to me. On the other hand, who says that every movie has to be important?The Coens bring some of their trademark ghoulish humor to the film, which was welcome, because I thought McCarthy could have lightened up a bit himself in the novel. The film feels oddly unemotional, mostly because all of the principal action revolves around characters who aren't remotely sympathetic (including Brolin's, who's a bit of a jerk really, when you think about it). The warmest character in the film is Brolin's wife, played in a lovely performance by the Scottish actress Kelly McDonald, but her part is tiny, and the character herself has little to do other than look perplexed or suspicious. I thought Bardem lacked the menace necessary to pull off Chigurgh, who's more of a supernatural representation of evil than a real character; I couldn't help but think what Benicio Del Toro could have done with the role. And Woody Harrelson pops up miscast as a hit-man, in a role as pointless in the movie as it is in the book.But again, all of these weaknesses were things the Coens inherited from the source material. They've made the best movie possible of McCarthy's novel, and ""No Country for Old Men"" easily joins ""Fargo,"" ""Blood Simple,"" ""Miller's Crossing,"" and ""The Man Who Wasn't There"" at the top of their canon.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Career Peak for the Coen Brothers,"The story that this movie is based upon, Cormac McCarthy's 2005-novel, reveals an America that's no country for anyone; and Tommy Lee Jones' character Sheriff Ed Tom Bell reflects the crime out-of-hand with wisdom, wit and maturity - as his narration over the deserted landscape tells his hours of darkness. And crime doesn't come any more out-of-hand, any darker or more horrifying than Anton Chigurh, masterfully played by Javier Bardem, an evil assassin which seems alienated from the rest of the world, looking at the other human beings as targets, intruders or no nothing. And crime floats over in the desert, as drug-dealing Mexicans executes deals-gone-bad, and this is where Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes in; as he discovers the $2 million in cash, he decides to take the money and run - who wouldn't? Drug-money belongs to nobody, and Moss becomes the film's moral dilemma, and Brolin gives the character the human heart the part needs; as we can put ourselves in his boots in this hellacious setting of crime and disgust. The great Roger Deakins, the director of photography, along with the Coen-brothers creates poetry here; not just one of 2007's most brilliant movies - but this is up there with Coen-classics as Fargo and the Big Lebowski. Rarely, a suspense-thriller makes us look into the abyss of our own making - No Country for Old Men does that, and it's one of the most delighted and tensioned experiences I've ever had in front off the screen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great cast and great directing made one pretty gripping and high quality thriller,"There are only a few thing which made me angry about this new thrillers . There are so many bloody and stupid plots which haven't got any sense . They are made out of some sick ideas . I can tell that everything what you can see of today's thrillers are often some stupid and really needless . They are full of stupid killing without any smartness . But in 2007 we could find one really great thriller . It has also one great fact. It won an Oscar for best moving picture . I think that structure of Oscar winners is changing in every year . This is movie which is made by Coen brothers and in start it is something attracting . I wasn't some big fan of their movies because after The Big Lebowski and A Serious Man I lost every hope for some their good movie . Then I decided to watch this well rated thriller and the result is impressive thriller .When we look that this movie isn't only centered as thriller we can know that it won't be some killing . I was very surprise with this structure of whole movie . It has got great narrative parts what is well known from other Coen brothers' movies .

This is reminding me on some classic but in same time it is gripping and really great thriller . It has got something what is attracting for watcher and it is interesting watcher . I was so excited during watching this movie because it is amazingly gripping and this fighting scenes have got real spirit of thrillers . I don't know so many great thrillers . In last time I can name only Shutter Island and this movie . This whole exciting scenes are definitely world-class and with this smartness by director they really surprised me .Tommy Lee Jones was very good . This famous actor in one maybe strange role but with his uncompromising sense for acting it is nicely done . He is actor which is definitely one of top actors . His sense for entertaining and also dramatic acting is impressive . I think that he was just in pace of the movie . It is so good and sometimes I think that he was in this movie so much so he did some kind of masterpiece . Sometimes he was looking like he will do something unexpected . He made one really nice dramatic part of the movie . His acting was really good because I think that he is world-class actor and there is no hard role for him .Josh Brolin was sometimes out of pace but during this silent scenes he showed his sense for dramatic scenes . I think that he did this dramatic and thrilling scenes just as he had to do , even better . He was out during narrative part because I think that he was sometimes bad because he looked too uninterested . Looks like he just wanted to do it . It wasn't done with soul .Javier Bardem was great villain . I think that he won't act something better than this . He was silent and I was astonished with his performance . I think that he was well prepared for this role . He was great and I think that this fight scenes was just as he wanted . I know that it is hard to act some villain . This is something what I call masterpiece because so convincing acting was great to see . I think that he was great.It is great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Unconventional Cohen Style,"I'm a hardcore Lebowski guy. No Country is a great movie, but it's no Lebowski. But then what is? And never mind that comparing the two movies would be like a comparison between a rabid rhinoceros and say, a bowl of oatmeal. But I still believe strongly that if any Cohen movie deserves best pic, it's Lebowski. It was just the right time, the right set of circumstances for them to get the nod for their latest work, which is well deserved, but feels more like a lifetime achievement award than a best pic/best director. I'm impressed, however, that the Oscar would go to a couple of my 'against the grain' film-making heroes and for such a dark, brutal film no less. Maybe things haven't completely given way to shmaltz and fluff in the motion picture academy?But what about No Country? As a long time admirer, I'm biased towards the Cohens so I loved it (more than many perhaps) for that reason alone. I wouldn't quite say that it's the Cohens at the height of their powers, but they definitely explored another avenue with this one. There's hardly a trace of the bizarre, deadpan humor that one has come to expect from a Cohen movie (even the often brutal Miller's Crossing had some chuckle-inducing moments). No, they definitely turned down another street with this one, a very dark, scary street.The signature Cohen way of giving the 'chaos and randomness' feel of real life occurrences to circumstances of fiction (even some of the most outlandish scenarios - as they've done in the past) is present, though. And when the Cohens apply their special brand of realism to violence, it produces some of the most frightening scenes of bloodletting in cinema...scenes that can't really be matched (unless you're Cronenberg or Kubrick). I love violent movies that shock you into thinking...""man what would that be like if it were happening to me?"" or ""That's probably what it would be like if it were really happening."" I think that's what really kept the movie afloat for me. It brought back some of the things I liked about Cronenberg's History of Violence, but No Country is a lead foot on the throttle when it comes to violence. Incredible. This movie sports some of the most realistic gunshot wound effects I've ever seen in film, and I've seen lots...I mean LOTS of movies depicting people getting shot. The movie's other main strong point is the the tight, relentless focus. Nothing is ever taken away from the nitty gritty of what is happening. The pacing, even when it slows to a meandering 'observing moments of a character' scene, never takes its eyes off what is unfolding between Brolin, Barden, TL Jones. I liked that a lot.The Cohens take liberties in No Country, and I sensed that they were indulging themselves a bit at times. But if you're a fan of their work, you'll appreciate this movie for many things that would skip past the uninitiated. They were indeed toying with the audience, but if you like Cohen bros. movies, then you like getting toyed with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Key to the Movie is. . .,"So, you saw the film, and you didn't get it, or maybe you thought ""there was nothing TO get!"" Well, I too love a good action movie with lots of unbelievable chase scenes and explosions and nice clean ending that wraps everything up neatly, and you can watch this movie and enjoy the action and the thrill of the hunt/chase which is really well filmed/edited (although there's not nearly enough to call this an ""action"" movie), but THAT is not what this film is really about.And I'm not sure I should really tell you what it's about, but I will direct you how to get there.The key is Tommy Lee Jones' dialog throughout the film, especially his voice-over at the very beginning (that you forget all about once the movie is going), but also his various interactions with his co-workers and friends. If you can watch the movie on DVD you should NOT tune out his dialog, you should pay very close attention to it. There are certain key phrases that come up that are deep and true and ring out like a Bible verse or a haiku. The movie is not about two men fighting over money, the movie is about Sheriff Ed Tom Bell; the rest of the action is a musical counterpoint to him. I suspect a lot of people get it backwards and come away confused.There are some other themes in the movie (chance, fate, justice) that I find less important, but certainly they are there and shouldn't be ignored.I have watched this film over and over the last few weeks, and come away every time with a strange feeling inside, a kind of ""existential spiritualism"" that I can't quite put a finger on. The movie is that deep if you give it the chance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Sea full of Sand,"Latest work from the Coen works as expected, or a little less. As much as you can hope on deep interiorizing, the most explored characters are the ultimately classical versus between Good and Evil. Bardem personifies Anton Chigurh, a man with no hints of humanity that kills because it's convenient and because he can. He never smiles, he talks clearly and with a profound, steady voice. He is the unrelenting evil Coen's want to explore.Although the premise follows Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) and his escape from Chigur's deadly hands, Brolin must not take that big of applause, neither big protagonism. His acting is hard, unrevealing. Instead, Tommy Lee Jones is textured as a sheriff that avoids violence, in a town where only dust and cactus gather. But his deep, extremely deep sensation of disturbia, nearly death and sense of duty is worth the ticket.Within it's minimalistic reach, no soundtrack, long determined pauses, ""No Country..."" accomplishes. It's a studied character piece, that I believe will be overgrown by oblivion within the pass of times; as it's popularity is within being unconventional, slow and impervious to common places.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Film for Fans of a Tidy Ending...............,"Throughout the experience I kept telling myself ""yes, this IS an 8.9 grade movie"". Beautifully filmed and directed, generally, I think it is one of the best Coen Bros. films produced to date. The scenes, scenery and settings are stark, grimy, impoverished and just great as a palette to the interaction of superb dialog and interesting characters. Check the camera play throughout the film. The Coens have a style and execution all their own, in a league with De Palma, Scorsese and the like, yes, maybe even Hitchcock. Plot development is subdued but edgy and there are some surprising and gratifying twists and turns.Character development is great and I am impressed with ALL the performances but especially with Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, in that order. Jones shines with his portrayal of the grizzled cowboy/sheriff, in a character reprisal similar to his role in ""Three Funerals"", I would love to see him paired up in a southwest movie along side Robert Duvall. Bardem is sinister and unflinching and reminds me of a flesh and blood ""Terminator""; Josh Brolin(looking like his dad's twin) terrific as the prey; a surprise appearance by Harrelson, sharp and witty, I'd like to see more of him in future projects.The big problem I have with this film is in it's culmination. I will say nothing more on this subject so that I do not create a spoiler. Suffice to say, despite ALL of its cumulative wonderfullness(?) I downgrade it from a 9 to a 7.5 because of the ""ending"". Reminds me of how I felt at the end of ""Blair Witch"". Too bad.....I hate unfulfilled expectation, especially after spending $8.50 for it..........Wait for the DVD rental........I'd like to say that I'm becoming more and more disenchanted with the ratings levels that appear in the IMDb. Clearly, because of the ending, this is NOT an 8.9 grade movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"half brilliant, half silly","This film seems to have the same central flaw as almost every other Coen Brothers film I've seen  it builds up fascinatingly and meticulously with great visual flair and originality, and then abandons the plot in favor of silly or wispy resolutions that aren't worth the time spent getting to them. The Man Who Wasn't There and Barton Fink come to mind. Secondly, these brothers are still writing ""quirky"" dialogue that calls attention to itself. I suppose it's ""clever"" but what else? Or is ""clever"" enough? I guess so, if the critical praise for this effort is any indication. I am reminded of some of David Lynch's villains who talk in cryptic riddles but Lynch deals with dreamscapes and the Coen Brothers are supposed to be in reality. And finally, here we have yet another serial killer / slasher / scary monster genre movie in which violent and explosive scenes of murder and mayhem occur in populated environments (a motel, a hotel, an office building in broad daylight, etc.) but no one except the central players are seen, no one calls the cops, no one intervenes, no one is around at the crucial moment  too easy and way too common as filmmakers seem to feel a need to maintain a high body count to keep the audience interested. The overall effect is cartoonish. After a while I was squirming in my seat from boredom, less and less concerned with the fates of the main characters.I was glad to see Kelly Macdonald (so memorable as Maggie Smith's long suffering and noble maid in Gosford Park) play a Texan, especially late in the story when out of the blue she shows some insight and intelligence. Josh Brolin as her rough but gentle Viet Nam vet husband matched her all the way  fine actor. Javier Bardem as the unstoppable Frankensteinish killer is truly frightening. But there is little substance beneath the cleverness and I am wondering if the strong points of this film come from the novel upon which it is said to be closely based. If any message is to be derived, it is that as time passes our society gets more and more violent and therefore this is ""no country for old men,"" but hasn't the old ""what's the world coming to?"" idea been around since the beginning of civilization?",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
one of the great movies,"One of the great movies, a profound movie--a Buddhist/Taoist movie. The ending is entirely appropriate, for this is not an action movie. The movie is about death--death as the overwhelming fact of life, so that any life is basically a meaningless failure. Faced with the overwhelming fact of death, all of us humans--especially the characters in this movie--find meaning only by making up their own spiritual codes, their Tao, their Way. The murderer's code, the good old boy's code, the sheriff's code, the wife's code--they are all equally meaningless, equally inadequate in the face of death, but they are all perfectly legitimate responses to the fact of universal death. (In the world of the movie they are perfectly legitimate responses--i, for one, would like to believe that in the real world it's better not to make up a murderer's code.) Given this world view, if redemption is possible, the movie makes clear that it could come in two forms: 1.) The made-up codes come into conflict, and those conflicts arouse interest, they have entertainment value. 2.) Helpless in the face of death, all people have a natural recourse available to them if they choose to take it--to take pity on, to nurture and care for their own even more helpless young; hence the parental theme in the movie, the father-son theme that is most prominent at the very end.The movie is beautiful in execution, in every respect--in acting, in film editing, in camera work, in script.

"""No Country For Old Men"" :An excellent film for which Joel Coen and Ethan Coen reward actors Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem with best roles of their careers.","There are many viewers who tend to believe that Coen brothers enjoy making light,enjoyable thrillers which are easy to comprehend by all and sundry as their humane protagonists hover around seemingly tolerable lines of good and evil.However,this is not at all true about their latest film ""No Country for Old Men"" as they have made a brilliant film in which an apparent simple cat and mouse chase becomes a ticklish affair for everybody involved in it.This film is able to strike a pleasant chord in viewers' hearts and minds as Coen Brothers make people believe that they are going to see something extraordinary as this particular film's emotional as well as philosophical dimensions are almost matchless.It is sad to state but many a viewer might be tempted to comment that superb acting talent of great American actor Tommy Lee Jones is not properly utilized.He has been given an extremely odd role where he looks very old,tired and completely depleted of energy.One would also not fail to remark that as usual,Coen brothers have given actress Kelly MacDonald a secondary role which would enable her to join the list of weak women characters in their films.Fargo is the only exception to this rule as it featured an extremely strong woman character.After having watched ""No Country For Old Men"",film critic/Senior French translator/interpreter Lalit Rao joined that famous league of extraordinary cinema admirers who have all been part of a hallucinatory experience called cinema as nights have a very special meaning in ""No Country For Old Men"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Movie that needs to be seen,"Let me get one thing straight. Just because you didn't like the way critics appreciated this film does not mean you have to give it a 1-star. I am not a huge fan of this film. Yet, no movie deserves a 1-star unless you are talking about absolute crap. This movie is not crap. Not even close.This movie is DIFFERENT. If you want all your action films to be like 'The Terminator', all your thrillers to be like 'The Silence of the Lambs', all your teen comedies like 'American Pie' well there will be no point of cinema. Indeed there will be no point of art.Once in a while movies like 'No Country For Old Men' are made. These movies buck the trend and when they actually manage to get critical acclaim, we have some idiots shouting hoarse that this is the worst movie they have ever seen. Critics can go wrong, but when a whole bunch of them say the same thing, there's got to be something to it. And though not a box-office superhit, it has done fairly well. Not a 'dud' by any standards.This movie has got a lot of things going for it. Javier Bardem's performance is right up there with the best. The visuals are ABSOLUTELY stunning. The other members of the cast are uniformly good (i wouldn't say excellent). The film has a very gritty feel to it and it is not exactly what you call a 'family film'. It is meant to stimulate you, make you think, and it does.Tell you what: Don't listen to the people who gave it a 1-star. Don't listen to those who gave it 10 stars, either. Watch the movie. make your own judgments. It is not the best movie ever made. Probably not even the best this year (though the Academy thinks otherwise) . But it is definitely worth a watch.

Aging sheriff tracks psycho.  Psycho tracks thief.,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am neither a gun nut nor a nihilist. What I found refreshing was the DEPTH, pace and even fearless moments of quiet. I say DEPTH because I was inclined to have stimulating conversations about the deeper meaning of the film with friends that resulted in satisfying revelations. I say ""fearless"" because the film actually slowed down and let the audience just DRINK IN the landscape, expressions and well spoken words at key moments that kept the pacing satisfying. That takes bravery because it creates a ""naked"" moment for the film maker. Some critics complain that is is a movie of too much ""darkness."" Great tragedies are rare nowadays.

For all film noir fans!,"The Coen brothers are one of the best directors still working (It's hard to tell, between Mel Gibson, Christopher Nolan , Scorsese and The Coen Brothers, who is the best) and they prove they are masters in film noir, making the experience so interesting that can bypass some screenplay mistakes, deserving 100%.We follow a story of Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), who discovers the remains of several drug runners who have all killed each other in an exchange gone violently wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss decides to simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This puts the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh (Bardem), on his trail as he dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander and even employer in his pursuit of his quarry and the money.The acting is this movie is absolutely fantastic, from Bardem ,Who deserved the Oscar (And is really the best performance in the film), to Gene Jones, who is the gas station proprietor, that is in that intense coin toss, that both ,Chigurh and him, knows that they are betting for his life. Or Woody Harrelson, who plays a charismatic investigator, that pays attention to minimal details. And Tommy Lee Jones, that is a sheriff, who is constantly suffering from all the disgrace that he is seeing (Who Remembered me of Morgan Freeman's character in ""Se7en"").The Screenplay mistakes that I referred in the first paragraph, is that if sometimes they use Chigurh to show how disgraceful our world is, but in other times they discuss the authenticity of that case, and how unusual it is, so it's a little controversial, but like I said, it doesn't stop this movie from deserving 100%. Some people told the accident in the end of the movie was pointless, but I think it was there to show us that, even an intelligent and meticulous psychopathic killer, is subject to unforeseen, and is vulnerable to accidents.Verdict: This proves again that The Coen Brothers are extremely talented directors, by giving us a masterpiece of film noir.Ps: Note that this review is bigger than my last ones, so tell me how do you prefer it, Longer reviews or like the last ones?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This is the kind of writing I miss in a story. The dialogue was so deep, my quote book is going to get loaded with the lines from it. The characters are interesting, it is funny, and shocking too.The ending is poetic, and is the kind of resolution you'd end up with for a story like this, it needs to be understood for what it is.

"If you did not get it, this may help","The film begins as drama and then moves into thriller mode and concludes with a meaning of life spin.

How surreal is my waking life and how real is my dream life? Is there more going on here than I can perceive?

One of the Top Ten Films of 2007,"2007 was a high quality year. Three of my favorite films of all time came out of that year. Zodiac, a gripping tale of murder and obsession. The Assassination of Jesse James, an emotionally psychoanalytical film about Jesse James and his relationship with Robert Ford. And this, No Country For Old Men.No Country For Old Men is the tale of a drug deal gone wrong and the violence that follows. The film follows three characters, Llewlynn Moss (Josh Broline) who is the hunter that finds the drug money and the bodies, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) who is one of many bounty hunters hired to retrieve the money and Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) who tries to find Moss before Chigurh does. The film is very violent but is a fantastic, character and action driven film by Joel and Ethan Cohen. The film is based on the novel by Cormac McCarthy.The film is a modern western. It features amazing performances by the three main actors, especially Javier Bardem (who is the best part of the film). Javier Bardem's sociopath Anton Chigurh is most definitely one of the most chilling characters to ever enter the crime genre, he is better than Hannibal Lecter.No Country For Old Men is basically a tale of cause and effect. The actions of the Moss character set off a chain reaction of violence. The film has cliffhanger ending which might disappoint most viewers, but it didn't bother me. The ending (which I will not spoil) has a meaning which I have yet to find. The whole film includes multiple situations of symbolism.All and all, No Country For Old Men is one of the best films to come out of the year 2007. Great performances and direction, as well as a nicely paced story. Watch it again and again to fully appreciate it.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
After Four Viewings Over 10 Years - It Is Still Amazing,"If I had a creative film fantasy to fulfill it would be to write a script that passed mustard with the Coen Bros.NCFOM should be in the top 100 films.

Every character is utterly real and the acting is flawless.As a Vietnam Veteran with two tours, I could relate pretty well to Bronson in the role. Where we depart is that he came to Vietnam he came out of the box with great hunting skills and instincts honed in the vast spaces of Texas. I can tell you the Army could not really teach those skill that were further refined in hunting men in Vietnam.Chigur: What can one say, but that he is both the ultimate psychopath and the messenger of death. Among the best performances Javier Bardem has ever has delivered.Woody Harrelson: This film is what made him the full blown talent he is to this day.

*****POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*****Gripping tale of a psychopathic killer has no ending...,"I have to give NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN a very mixed review.For the most part, I agree that NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a well executed crime drama, patterned somewhat after the much better written FARGO, in which the central character was a female officer. Here, it's a male sheriff (TOMMY LEE JONES) given to some armchair psychiatry aimed at trying to understand what makes today's western civilization (or lack of it) tick. He gets no answer from the script.Nor do we get a satisfying ending to a story that is full of grim menace supplied by its main character (JAVIER BARDEM) who goes around dispensing with almost every member of the supporting cast.Nor do the characters act in a way that makes common sense. This is the main trouble with the script. WOODY HARRELSON, for example, seems to walk meekly to his final destiny with the casual air of a man unalarmed by the situation after warning JOSH BROLIN (a man on the run) that he's up against a man who simply wants blood. Likewise, Brolin's wife accepts her fate meekly after stating that she ""knew"" the killer would show up on her doorstep.It's taut with suspense most of the time with only a few spots that drag, but it's the inconsistencies of certain characters that gave the script some flaws, as well as a general lack of humor which made the dark happenings in FARGO more bearable.The biggest letdown is the dry ending with no justice for the guilty man and Tommy Lee Jones describing a dream that has nothing to do with the events we just witnessed. Period. The End.The very flat ending is the weakest part of all. But the performances of JAVIER BARDEM, TOMMY LEE JONES and especially JOSH BROLIN in a very unusual role for him, make the film eminently worth watching.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece of the Modern West,"A drug deal gone wrong, a pile of bodies, and two million dollars of missing cash; such are the things that many a gangster film, gritty cop movie, and shoot-em-up have been made from. And in the hands of Joel and Ethan Coen, it provides the perfect material for one hell of a modern day western.By the time hunter Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds the money, he's already seen the bodies and the drugs. He knows the stakes, and he knows that certain people will not rest until they recover that money. But how could he know that he'd be pursued by a man like Anton Chigurh. Chigurh (Javier Barden) is one of the deadliest, most merciless, and downright craziest men you could ever. If you present even the slightest inconvenience to him, he will look you in the eye, talk to you as calmly as if you were talking about the weather, and gun you down without a second thought. Sometimes he doesn't even need an excuse. He's the kind of person that bodies just seem to materialize wherever he goes, and if he's looking for you, you might as well already be in the ground.Of course with all these people dying, it won't be long before the law get's involved. Enter Sheriff Ed Tom (Tommy Lee Jones). He's seen just about everything in his long years as county sheriff, and it doesn't take him long to figure out that Llewellyn is in way over his head. Now he's in a race to see if he can catch up with Llewellyn and the money before Chigurh can.As you would expect from the Coen Brothers, No Country for old men is an intricate, compelling, and somewhat strange tale. Under their direction, what might be merely a simple chase movie takes on a higher level of complexity, as the characters try to outwit and stay one step ahead of each other. This movie also knows how to play its cards close to its chest. It withholds enough information to keep you guessing, but never so much that you become frustrated. It should be noted that the Coens really have a way with dialog. I haven't seen a script with this much restraint since The Magnificent Seven. There's not a single unnecessary word in the entire film. When the characters do speak, their words are full of wit and personality. For instance, when Ed Tom here's about the three men gunned down in a cheap motel room, he refers to it as 'natural causes.' ""Natural for their line of work.""Or take Chigurh's exchange with the convenience store clerk. On the surface, it doesn't seem to have any connection to the rest of the movie, or even to make sense, but looking deeper you realize there's a sinister subtext to every word, one that gives strong indication of just how screwed up it is inside Chigurh's head. And the final scene, which I will not reveal, is pure Coen. It's deep, inscrutable, and completely unexpected. It reminded me very much of Copula's The Conversation.No Country for Old Men is a dark and violent film, with no interest in imparting morals or providing happy endings. It's not the kind of movie you want to pull off the shelf when you need an escape. But it is also a powerful and engaging film that you will not soon forget. Here the Coens have given audiences one of the most chilling pictures of evil in many years, along with their best movie since Fargo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What's the big deal? (Spoilers),"**SPOILERS ABOUND**The characters are boring, the plot is thin and it just kinda ends. I know it's based off of a novel, but that's not an excuse for a movie as empty as this one. Everyone acts as if they're on a heavy dose of Ambien and have little to no personality to speak of. This makes it hard for me to care about anything happening to them. The only exception to this is Llewelyn's wife who actually shows emotion. Anton is exceptionally boring. Pretty crazy that all you have to do to win an acting Oscar is talk monotonously and rarely show any facial expressions. The guy hardly said anything the entire movie. There are a few glaring issues with some of the plot points in this movie. Llewelyn finds the money and gets away only to come back later to bring a dehydrated man some water. Why not call the police and let them know what happened if you're concerned about the guy? They'll give him medical care, and you won't put yourself in harm's way. This plot contrivance only served the purpose to have Anton find Llewelyn's truck and find out who he's looking for. The rest of the movie is a very boring cat and mouse chase. After a bunch of emotionless boring ""chasing"" with one brief shooting scene, the main character unceremoniously dies off camera. Nobody ever finds the satchel full of money and Anton gets away. YAWN.Boring characters and a boring plot. Only good thing about this was the cinematography and the acting was pretty good I guess too despite how incredibly bored everyone acted. No idea why people liked this movie so much. Next time I'm having a hard time sleeping I'll put this movie on.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Suspenseful and Gripping,"No Country for Old Men has been widely praised by critics and considered one of the greater films of its release year as well as of the decade. This film may be classified as a perfectly realized modern day western thriller which combines moments of hard-edged violence, several sequences of suspense, frequent interjections of deliciously dry and laconic humor, and flashes of how not only the world has changed but the way our perspectives do as we get older.Much of the suspense comes from the cjaracter of Javier Bardem, as he steals his scenes. Josh Brolin is one of his earlier star turning roles, delivers a masterful performance. With these performances, is the main reason as to why this film is as great, as well as the directing and overall visuals of the scenery. The violence stands out in the film as graphic and it works in its favor. Overall, No Country is a well made drama, though a film not for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Well done. Exciting and entertaining crime drama epic from the Coen brothers that's intelligent and interesting.,"""No Country for Old Men"" is without a doubt one of the better films I've seen in a long time. It's well mixed with suspense, drama, action, and intrigue the entire time to keep the viewer on the edge. Yet many may feel like me and feel displeased at the ending, but the Coen brothers wanted everyone to form their own call and to think about the right closure. The scenes are well done too and the acting is super especially from veterans Brolin and Jones.Set across the state of Texas mostly in rural sites and crossing over to some metro areas the film is a joyride from the start. Beginning with hunter Llewelyn Moss(Josh Brolin)who makes a gruesome discovery of dead bodies and also a stash of cash like two million from an apparent drug deal gone wrong near Rio Grande and the Mexican and American border. From then on the action and journey begins when ruthless and cold stoned looking criminal thug Anton Chigurh(Javier Bardem who plays the part brilliant)goes hot on the trail of the missing cash all across the state from car chases to even a hotel shootout. Many of the scenes are memorable like that of Anton's flipping of the coin to decide the life and fate of the store clerk by heads or tails! The Coen brothers use the cat and mouse theme so well between these two central characters so well it makes the film even more enjoyable to watch.Yet at a half point of the film it feels a little odd when Woody Harrelson enters as bounty hunter Carson Wells which in my opinion was a wild card character that the Coen brothers used but why who knows. The leader and weight of the film is carried by the Tommy Lee Jones character that of veteran and old timer type burned out Texas sheriff Bell. The film opens with narration and closes with narration from the Bell character. And as always watching and hearing Tommy Lee is special, as his character feels out of touch as time and life has passed him up in which many can relate and feel for when they watch.Overall ""No Country for Old Men"" is highly enjoyable and entertaining to watch and intelligently done from the Coen brothers. In my opinion I didn't really like the ending, but many films leave the viewer to form their own take and make the call for themselves adding more suspense and intrigue to the enjoyment. Still the strong performances from Jones, Bardem and Brolin along with the films action and suspenseful journey of drama make it a clear winner and instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
emphatic and picturesque but really powerful,"This is really a masterpiece, probably the best film among all the Coen's brother's works, and deserved all the Academy Awards it just won; Brolin gives a really perfect performance as Moss, Bardem is literally terrific in the role of Chigurh, a crazy predator showing craziness for two and a half hours, Tommy Lee Jones as well is outstanding. It's an extremely original perspective of life, violence, loneliness, regrets, never boring, though a bit disturbing due to the terrifying violence. The underlying message of No Country for Old Men is also the unpredictability of real life, the set of opportunities we are missing and we have missed. Think the power of the movie is enhanced by the appropriate locations where it was shot, an outline of rural and backward America, along with violent and dangerous Mexico. I'd have expected a different finale, clearer at least, whereas this one might leave the onlooker with some doubts. Nevertheless it's surely an extraordinary story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very Intense,"Won't say much in this review but here we go...This movie by the Coen Brothers is arguably their best work. Javier Bardem turns into one of the scariest characters I've seen in a long time. He reminds me of Robert Mitchum in ""Cape Fear"". Ruthless, terrifying, hides in the shadows and evil as can be. Tommy Lee Jones does a good job as the sheriff just too slow to catch up to Anton (Bardem). Josh Brolin plays the man thrown into Anton's trail after finding a drug deal gone wrong. Won't spoil the movie, but if you haven't seen it your lost anyways.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"This is two movies in one: What to definitely do in film-making, and what NOT to do in film-making. Entertainment (then utter disappointment) at its finest","No Country For Old Men is an amazing thriller full of tension, suspense, well-directed moments, fantastic imagery, wonderful dialogue, superb acting, and a nice plot to tie it in together. Then the movie decides to end. This film takes one of the biggest quality downfalls I have ever seen in my life, and this is by no means exaggeration. How does a movie do so well for so long and then deliver such utter garbage when we the viewer least needed it? How on earth does a movie full of tension for so long suck out the entertainment and desire to continue watching in a mere matter of moments? The questions continue to linger through my head as I write this; as the Best Picture Oscar winner disappointed me in ways I've never been disappointed before.The worst part is the hard-hitting potential that was chugging along the fantastic story four-fifths of the way. The Coen Brothers looked like they ran out of ideas or just had no clue how to stop rolling the cameras and finish the gosh-darn story. In a film that liked showing more than telling throughout the first 90 minutes, it was certainly a surprise when the rest of the film was pretty much just narrated to us, as if we were a bunch of idiots. Main characters in the end are whether watered-down, having a serious case of the talkies, or just flat-out disappeared. This is easily one of the weakest films to actually receive a Best Picture nod. Well, at least it ain't Crash but it's certainly a movie that could have been one of the best in decades.In this film, we follow a hunter (Josh Brolin) becoming hunted down by Mexican criminals, lawmen (Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones), and a psychotic killer (Javier Bardem) because of a great deal of money he discovered at a crime scene. This is pretty much a tense, violent cat-and-mouse game that has a good deal of followers and supporting players. No Country For Old Men is based off a novel with the same name by Cormac McCarthy; and translates well to the screen with very few changes and subtractions. The Coen Brothers can weave a good script, and their previous work is definite proof of this (Fargo, come on now). The dialogue of the killer Anton was downright scary, and the philosophical views of the cops involved also spark a bit of interest. However, when staying close to the original material, one tends to forget that original material does have its flaws as well. Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers were also very accurate with the weak portions in the book.The ensemble cast in the film is absolutely wonderful, from the usually awesome Tommy Lee Jones to the decent Josh Brolin to the incredibly scary Javier Bardem. The film has a heavy dosage of cruel realism and the acting is one of the main reasons why this film worked so well for so long. Bardem portrays one of the best movie villains in ages, even surpassing that of Heath Ledger's Joker and Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith. His performance overpowers that of everyone else's by leagues.Let's discuss what made this film so magnificent for the first two acts. First off, the directing was phenomenal as there were many series of long shots that built up the tension to a point in which you couldn't breathe. Then there's the incredible cinematography that could craft beauty out of dull settings. Last but not least was the quick pacing that kept the story flowing well and maintaining the interest of the viewer involved. While the portrayals of the characters could have used some major work writing-wise (the origins of almost all the main characters were pretty much non-existent) they kept the movie interesting. The lack of a soundtrack allowed for us to truly appreciate the incredible usage of sound involved (even a wrapper made a distinctively realistic noise when placed on a table).Ending. What ending? The film literally wraps up in the middle of a scene. The film literally has no major climax, doesn't wrap up any loose ends, goes on a philosophical tangent, creates even more questions (which is never good if you are trying to END the movie) than answers. Everything going for this powerhouse flick was thrown away towards the end and instead we get this muddled, disgusting affair of dialogue. First 100 or so minutes: a lot of bark and bite. The last 20 minutes: weak, weak, weak barking and not a single bite. It was as if we were seeing two totally different movies, and neither one of them technically ended. It was as if the last pages of a good book were replaced with unsatisfying and useless Chicken Soup for the Soul quotations. The movie could have ended worse only if it were done in a gigantic musical interlude with hyper fruits flying out of cannons. Other than that random suggestion, you have to dig pretty hard to find the last time a good movie that ended in such a sour note.Bottom Line: beautiful gem in the beginning, utter trash and garbage by the end of it all. What hurts the most is that with so much potential, the Coen Brothers ripped apart what made the movie work and spiraled it towards heavy disappointment level. The sour taste of the ending still lingers in my mouth as I write this. Best Picture? Sorry, but the entire movie has to deserve it, not just most of it. It's a total shame because there was such good usage of sound, such good cinematography, and grand acting. No Country For Old Men was like a five-star meal with a two-star topping. Let me end the review just like the mov-",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Modern masterpiece,"The Coen Brothers rank amongst my favourite writers/directors, regardless of whether they are doing comedy (Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona, The Hudsucker Proxy, O Brother Where Art Thou?) or drama (Fargo, Millers Crossing, Barton Fink, The Man Who Wasn't There).This is a Coen drama but if there is a Coen-drama formula, they have just redefined it, and indeed potentially rewritten how all thriller-dramas are written and directed.One of the most original movie structures and plots I have seen, up there with Memento in terms of innovativeness.Truly a modern masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Anyway i believe in soul so i think Chigurgh is a disgusting monster but i have to give him some credit.

Terrifying.,"No Country for Old Men is a terrifying insight into how the freedom to bounce around the USA, like a bad penny, can leave trails of destruction unimaginable to even the sturdiest of law enforcers.The Cohen brothers use the wild and endless landscapes of America's south as the canvas for the calmest imaginable psychotic, Shagor, (Javier Bardem), the ageing and tired Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and country boy Llewelyn Moss' money triangle.The trail begins and grows after Moss finds and runs away with two million in cash. Shagor is employed to track it down and Bell is chasing all concerned after cleaning up the finale of a drug deal gone bad. Bell realises that Moss needs protecting from his own greed as Shagor is a man familiar with taking the freedom to roam as synonymous with the freedom to kill.The film is a work of art: silence and tension fill the gaps between the noise and death. It is also a metaphor for the reality of western freedom. A storm is brewing; money and freedom are its heart and men are the ones stirring up the wind and rain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This is one of my favorite movies,"To me this is more than just a movie; it is a statement of a time in America that shocked us all. This movie also takes place in my home state of Texas. Sometimes a movie transcends being a movie and becomes a historical icon. I love Texas and have always wanted to live here since first heard the word cowboy and I bought my first ZZ Top Album in the 1970's. There is a certain mysticism about Texas, the cowboy life and wide open spaces. Suddenly violence struck America over drugs. Suddenly this violence grew over night; it seemed. It even spilled over to the open plains of small town Texas. Drugs ushered in the lose of the all American innocents. The acting is absolutely perfect. Javier Bardem who was this guy? His performance was amazing. Josh Brolin: again I never heard of him till I saw this and he was so convincing as his character; I could picture no one else as good. Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson all I can say it is about time we have seem them shine as they should. This movie is not about violence it is about the end of our ignorance to how far people go in the name of money and greed.Other movies by the Coen brother I love like my favorite Levis is: Burn After Reading, The Ladykillers, The Man Who Wasn't There, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, The Big Lebowski, Fargo. Come on Coen's you can do it, I am keeping my fingers crossed for you.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Prepare to be speechless,"10 out of 10... most of the time when I see a review with 10 out of 10 I disregard it as a disingenuous momentary grandeur. However, No Country for Old Men is a fantastic movie. But why? Why is this movie so great... it's been out merely 1 week and it's already the 55th best movie ever made as of 11/21. To follow the same outline as the plot, the answer to that question is complicated.No Country for Old Men follows a lucky middle aged welder who happens to be in the right place at the right time (or wrong time). Throughout the movie, you follow protagonists and antagonists - the lines between them are blurred, and you never quite know who to keep sympathy for, and who to feel animosity towards. The real gem of this movie is how realistic each character is portrayed. The viewer will feel a deep connection with every single character that is introduced. The movie is filled with emotion, surprises, twists, and momentary quips of humor. The atmosphere created by the director is truly something to cherish, this movie hits the perfect pitch when it comes to this - a true rarity in todays motion picture industry.If you find my review a bit ambiguous, then I've prepared you well. A good movie makes the viewer feel insignificant and truly a spectator - and you will not be disappointed in the least by this movie. I can best compare No Country for Old Men with other fantastic gems such as Pulp Fiction, and Kill Bill. But, the action, story telling, and character development is far superior. There is a reason this movie is rated so highly, it truly is a timeless instant classic - I'm still amazed by the film. One of the most important things this movie conveys is a message... but what you take from the movie is on your own accord.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coen's best film to date,"Ever since Fargo and The Big Lebowski, the Coen brothers seem to have gone down hill. The Ladykillers and Intolerable Cruelty are very much below what these two are capable of creating. However, they're back and better than ever. No Country for Old Men isn't one of their best films, it is their best film by far.No Country for Old Men opens with a narration from Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones). ""I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job - not to be glorious. But I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand."" Within the next five minutes, we know exactly what he means by that. The first time Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is introduced, he has been arrested and taken to the police station. While the officer is making a phone call, Chigurh quietly maneuvers to get his handcuffs from behind his back to the front of his body. After the officer finishes the call, Chigurh walks from behind and chokes the officer to death using his handcuffs. Using the deputy's car, he pulls over a motorist, kills him with a cattle gun and swaps cars.Out in the desert, Llewellyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a Vietnam veteran and welder, hunts for antelope. After failing to kill his target, he stumbles upon the bloody aftermath of a drug deal gone wrong. Everyone is dead except for one man pleading for water. Moss finds the drugs and knows that there could be money around. He turns out to be correct. Pondering on the situation for a while, he decides to take it. Later that night, his conscience gets the better of him. He fills a jug of water and drives back to the scene of the crime. Unfortunately for Llewellyn, the man appears to be dead and two men in a pickup truck park next to his car (which he parked far away) and slash his tires. The men spot Moss and send him on a chase, even using their dog to attack. Moss escapes and tells his wife to pack so she can stay with her mother while he devises a plan to outsmart the men who are after him. One of those men is Chigurh.Moving at a methodical pace, No Country for Old Men builds it tension to a level rarely, if ever, seen in a film. There's one scene involving Moss and Chigurh in a hotel that scared me shitless. Chigurh, using a transponder, locates the room Moss is staying in. For about a minute or two, nothing happens, as each man braces himself for the confrontation. A similar situation happens between Chigurh and another character later.The acting is nothing short of exceptional. The main and supporting actors are on top of their game. Josh Brolin is having a breakout year, acting in In the Valley of Ellah, Grindhouse, American Gangster, and now this. Tommy Lee Jones played a similar role in his own movie, The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, but his emotional range appears to be much greater here. Although these two actors are great here, Javier Bardem steals the show.Anton Chigurh might be as frightening of a villain as Hannibal Lector, if not more so. His stiff posture, menacing stare, calculated word usage, emotionless expressions, unorthodox principles and remorseless killings make him appear to be not human. In some ways he is human and other ways more of an idea, like the embodiment of violence. He views his himself as a person carrying out fate and thus has a detachment from his victims. His background is a mystery because anyone who knows something about him is dead.Artistically, the film is superb. Seeing the vast emptiness of the desert in the first few scenes recalls similar images in Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. The minimalist music score heightens the tension and allows every sound to be heard.The film's transition from an impressive thriller into philosophical territory elevates its lasting effect. All of the complaints from people about the third act are bullshit. The supposed ""plot holes"" some mention are a result of their lack of attention to details. Also, people expecting non-stop nonsensical violence are going to be disappointed. There's a lot more to this than just the thriller elements.Just as No Country for Old Men opens with a narration from Bell, he ends the film with one too. He describes a dream he has about him and his father. It may be the only optimistic scene in this very bleak film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Enjoyable and Suspenseful Film,"I really enjoyed this movie. Very suspenseful. You're pulling for the Vietnam vet to outsmart the heartless assassin and there are all kinds of twists and turns and whatnot. I did not find this film boring at all.You need to pay attention during this movie or it might not make sense. It might be best to watch it a couple times. I liked it the first time, but on second viewing I noticed things that I'd missed before. And I definitely think this is a good movie for repeated viewings, as long as you liked it. Engrossing suspense.As to the ending, it's controversial. I won't give it away, but some people like it and some people hate it. I guess what you might want to think of is that Tommy Lee Jones's sheriff character (the ""old man"" in the title) is really the main character. The point of the story is how the world is changing, as seen by an old Texan sheriff. Everything else happens around that.I haven't read Cormac McCarthy's book, but this film is supposed to be very faithful to it, ending and all.The story also seems to deal with some fairly deep philosophical ideas, which I am not prepared to delve into. You can find out more about that stuff in the discussion topics.I'm not a film scholar, but I had no problems with this one, acting, writing, directing, or otherwise. There IS violence, and that didn't bother me. If you don't like violence, this might not be for you. Definitely not for children, and that's why it's rated R.Despite the violence and the blood, this isn't an ""action"" movie. But this film commands your attention and has you on the edge of your seat. Even when you know how it all ends, it's still fun to go along for the ride all over again.I could watch this film again and again and again.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Embodiment of Evil,"NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the Coen brothers best and most violent work to date, and arguably, has the best ensemble of actors this year.Set in New Mexico, the story begins with a local hunter/welder named Llewelyn Moss stumbling across a rotting group of pickups and corpses. He carefully makes his way through the bodies, picking up spare guns and ammo, and eventually comes across a case of two million dollars, the lone key to an early retirement for him and his wife, Carla Jean. He goes home for a short while, then due to certain earlier events, Moss returns to the scene of the crime to hopefully clear his conscience. From there on out, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN roars off into the realm of classic cat and mouse cinema, and the villain Anton Chigurh is introduced.Void of music, NC4OM relies on the sound of boots and bullets in a way that I've never experienced. Every sound, however minute, brings forth an air of tension not commonly seen in films; from the soft clang of Chigurh's cannister to the empty wind that circulates the barren wasteland of the southwest, sound is used perfectly in this film.The cinematography is exceptional; the wide open spaces and blue skies encompass the screen with such a majesty that one feels tempted to flee the confines of the theater and walk among the desert and shrubs. As long as Anton is far from sight.NC4OM is really pretty flawless film making, and despite the perfect score there were a couple very minor questions that remained unanswered(I'm sure the book will clarify), but all in all, from the direction to the acting, from the sound to the cinematography, and then everything in between, this film was great.The film's most lasting impression however is the character of Anton Chigurh, Moss' inexorable assailant whose personal philosophy and moral weight instantly catapults him to judge, jury and executioner. He is evil in every form of the word, and could very well be interpreted as a walking Armageddon or perhaps even Satan. Javier Bardem is great in this role, and will most likely have to battle Casey Affleck /Ed Harris/Steve Zahn for any best supporting actor nominations this year. Though of course, there would be little deliberation if Anton Chigurh had anything to do with it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"The greatest villain since Hannibal Lecter, the best film of the new millennium, the Coen's deliver again","No Country for Old Men may quite possibly be the best Coen brothers film to date. From the two men who brought you The Big Lebowski (one of the best comedies of the 90's) Fargo (one of the best drama's of the 90's) and O Brother Where Art Thou? (one of the most beautifully crafted films of 2000) comes this film. If you thought nothing could ever top those three films you are in for a big surprise, No Country for Old Men is not only the best film of 2007 but also one of the best films of the new millennium. It is the nearest to perfection one can get. It is, simply, a modern masterpiece.The story revolves around Llewelyn Moss, a retired worker who hunts antelope in the deserts of Texas. One day Moss stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and also $2 million in cash. Moss takes it and flees only to have a Mexican gang and a sinister assassin by the name of Anton Chigurh. Along the way several men become part of the fray including a sheriff about to retire and a rival assassin of Chigurh's. The story follows that of Llewelyn mostly but Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Bell also plays a significant role. In the end it is more then a battle of wits between Moss and Chigurh, it is a battle of good and evil.First off the acting in the film is among the best I've seen since American Beauty. Brolin, Jones, and Bardem are all Oscar worthy in my opinion. Brolin delivers the perfect portrayal of a man on the run who knows how to use his brain. We don't see Brolin running around shooting at everything that moves, instead the Coens' let us view Moss using his brain which makes the film way more interesting. Brolin's mild manner mix perfectly for the mold of Llewelyn Moss. Overall a great protagonist created by the Coens' and a great portrayal by Josh Brolin, a man we don't see too much of these days.By far the best acting I've seen by a person this decade comes from that of Spanish actor Javier Bardem as the cold hearted Anton Chigurh. Chigurh sent shivers down my spine every time he spoke and every time he moved. His calm demeanor, mixed with his sociopathic mind makes him simply haunting. What made him the most frightening is that he is so believable. He is smart and deadly but also very much believable and very unique. Instead of the cast mold for villains in cinema (kill, kill, kill), McCarthy makes Chigurh more of like the Angel of Death, deciding who dies by the flip of a coin. His weapon of choice is unique, even how he talks is quite different from most villains of the day. I could easily see a story about a murder like this guy appearing in a paper. While Chigurh is silent and many would portray him as a one-dimensional antagonist, Bardem brings life and soul to the character. This is not the Coen's or McCarthy's work but Bardem's work that makes Javier Chigurh the greatest villain since Hannibal Lecter and one of the greatest in cinema history. Javier Bardem, to say the least, is simply brilliant.I have few complaints about the film. Many people found a problem with the ending. I had no problems with it. I was thoroughly satisfied as I walked out of the late show. The Coens' make you think. They don't make everything obvious which most directors do. They make an audience think and that is what they do in No Country for Old Men. The movie takes us into the relationship of good and evil and some beautiful scenes are shown to explain how these two interact everyday. The film will shake you up, make you think, and always have you looking over your shoulder expecting to see the red eyes of Chigurh with his coin ready to decide your fate.No Country for Old Men had me thinking about it for days after. The symbolic meanings of the characters and the speech at the end, the amazing, three-dimensional characters, the beautiful story that is crafted perfectly by McCarthy and adapted beautifully by the Coen's. I honestly wanted to see this movie again and again. Give the film time and don't cast your thumbs up or thumbs down on it until you have let it sit for a day and you have thought about it. I find it to be the best film since American Beauty and a beautiful film with a haunting villain.5/5 stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Worth it...,"I saw this movie in Cannes in May, and I'm still thinking about it today. It's the one film I've been recommending to everyone, no matter what kind of movies they usually like. It will stick with you, and that's often the sign of a good film. Few films these days have that kind of mental impact and sticking power considering how much entertainment is thrust at us. But I see commercials or previews for this movie today and it sends chills down my spine knowing what is going to happen.Some will come away from the film with the negative reactions I'm reading below, because it doesn't end all neat and tidy the way a typical Hollywood film does. But somehow they think that it makes it unreal? Real life isn't neat and tidy, and despite the hyper-real characters the Coen's typically create, the situation and events seem like they real could happen, as could the outcome.Beyond that, the film-making is superb, the acting (other than woody harrelson crap) is fantastic, the characterizations often chilling.I've seen better movies in my life, but not so far this year, and based on what's left for the next 6 weeks, this movie might win the Oscar by default. Not that it isn't deserving, but it would be nice if there were some stronger competition out there. But with most ""serious"" Hollywood filmmakers obsessed with disseminating their views on politics and forgetting to create actual good films, this year is lacking.So thank the Coen's for reminding us there is still good drama to be found out there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Ill never get the 2 hrs and 8 minutes of my life back,"Just got back from this movie. Not only was it a huge disappointment but it made no sense to me at all. Do I really need 128 minutes to figure out times are changing? The Villain was good but the rest of the cast was horrendous the movie could have been done in 45 minutes and made the same point to me, When the movie ended it was like a sigh from the crowd they didn't know it was over and why.I expected a whole lot more from this film but it left me wondering why I just spent $38.50 on tickets and snacks.The pointless killings and pointless rambling in this film are just not going too make people feel good about the film itself . Also Im not sure if it was my theater or the copy of the film itself but the picture quality was absolutely disgusting . Dirt specks throughout the film on the film.My Opinion Mr. Brooks was 100 times the movie this was and I would suggest renting it and stay home.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Let No Country for Old Men choose your friends.,"I love this movie because I love arguments about movies. Being the elitist that I am, I have come to use this as my polarising stick when seeing what others' taste is like. If you don't find No Country for Old Men fascinating, I'll prescribe you some sedatives and send you to bed. If you do, you're allowed inside. I've found it hilarious to listen to people complain about how boring it was, how long-winded and stale it was. How they thought American Gangster was the best movie they've ever seen, and why No Country for Old Men should have been more like it.I could both write and read essay upon review or even a PhD or two about this film given the time. I can't think of any other film I have seen that balances philosophy and plot so well without having a shade of pretentiousness about it. You can talk about the moral decay of America. The pervasive and relentless evil and how that is realised today in society or like Anton Chigurh, in people. You can talk about fate and destiny. What Anton's coin means for his victims. Whether fault lies in chaos, the flip of the coin. Or whether fault is in the person, Anton. You can grab any piece of history, religion or philosophy and see what this film has to say. It's fascinating. A film like this is one that you can't ""look too far"" into, because the way that it is crafted invites its viewers to do exactly so in as invasive fashion as its main antagonist. I think to come away satisfied and content you will need to.Beware to all, though. This has also become a movie that people who think they are pro cinema have taken to be one of theirs. If someone professes their love for it, ask why. If they do nothing but outpour their love for the Coen brothers, they are your enemy. This is one movie that anyone can put some thought into and have a perspective on. If they don't, they're full of crap.I read in a news article recently that this Australian film critic thought that 2007 was the beginning of another golden age in cinema. He talked about the 40s and the 70s. The relatively short time periods that consistently produce incredible films. While he did write like an essay by Kevin Smith about Magnolia, I am beginning to agree. 2007 had two American films that everyone is talking about. They're not films that we'll talk about, buy on DVD and forget about. Time will tell, but I am confident that this is a landmark in the nearing 100 odd year tradition of cinema,",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Fate, Chance and Unstoppable Evil","A sheriff in West Texas stumbles across a drug deal gone wrong. He is left hunting an innocent man who has taken the money from the deal (two million dollars) and the hit-man who killed the dealers and is trying his best to kill the man with the money. Throw in gun fights, secret stashes and border-crossing and you've got yourself the Coen Brothers' best film in years.What makes this film great (aside from the gorgeous cinematography) is also what makes it confusing for many people. The film is a bait and switch: we think we are watching a film about shoot-outs and men trying to escape the law with the loot (the same as any other Western or gangster story out there). And, to some degree, we are. But more importantly we are being told a lesson about fate and chance: we can live or die in any instance, either because we are destined to do so or merely by chance. While it's not common to accept both possibilities, this film makes a convincing case.The Coen Brothers love having the ""unstoppable evil"" character. Take, for example, John Goodman in ""Barton Fink"". And they definitely deliver with the hit-man Chigurh (who also carries the burden of fate and chance with him). Many great scenes exist in this film, but one that stood out the most for me was early in the film when Chigurh confronts a gas station attendant. I don't know if even a knife could cut that tension. The suspense was strong, and I was literally on the edge of my seat (which happens to be a futon in this case).This film is tied with ""There Will Be Blood"" for most Oscar nominations in 2007 (and at the time of this writing has not yet been judged). The tally is eight, and I can't agree more with this. 2007 was a good year for films (I also loved ""Juno"") and this ranks as one of the best, if not the very best. Even if you don't ""get it"" (I didn't at first and maybe still don't fully), you'll like this movie. Tommy Lee Jones, playing a cop for the 100th time, has perfected it. And Josh Brolin comes hot off of ""Planet Terror"" to show us he's ready to be a headliner. Show him some support.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Definitely not for las chicas,"For me an almost perfect movie. Isn't to everyone's taste but the storyline, the dialogue, and the constant tension kept me enthralled throughout. The Coens have come up with another antidote to the usual formulaic Hollywood nonsense. If you don't know the story, you'll never guess the outcome.I read the book after I saw the film. Whole chunks of the dialogue in the book have been used without amendment in the film - just a little bit unusual but testament to Mr McCarthy's skill and the screenwriter's common sense.Yes, there were slivers of pretension at times (grace a the author's words). but this didn't stop the movie from working on almost every level.Best movie I've seen for years.

Josh Brolin seems to be not so resourceful, he makes serious mistakes as the accidental cowboy who finds the money near Rio Grande in an area where the fight between drug gangs occurred.

Simply Chilling,"The latest outing by the Coen Brothers is a chilling mix of horror, film noir, thriller, western, and yes even comedy, (Tommy Lee is always a stitch) but still remaining true to the twisted vision of the very entertaining work of these rather unorthodox artists.No Country For Old Men is somewhat reminiscent of Blood Simple, their first outing, but infinitely more bloody. When I first viewed it in the theater, quite frankly I was NOT well for the ending. Absolutely no loose ends were tied up. A subsequent viewing helped me realize it was for the best. Each viewer will have to decide exactly how it ended and from what I understand the movie ending was not like the novel ending.When the interpretation of a work is totally up to the viewer, that, of course, always makes for a more compelling artistic presentation simply because the art does not do your thinking for you: this one is no different.Hands down, the most chilling aspect of this was the performance of Javier Bardem and his Oscar was indeed well-deserved. He was so calm he was very, very frightening. You did not (or more aptly, COULD not) invest anything into him emotionally. This was indeed deliberate. There was no need to, actually to adequately present the story. Even Llewellen (Josh Brolin's character) you felt something for, and Tommy Lee Jones, who, regardless of the character, ALWAYS manages to make you care about him, was probably the most fleshed-out character.Actually the movie was not as slow as one is led to believe...it is most deliberate and since the Brothers get right to the point at the very beginning, you are indeed intensely involved with how this will play itself out.If you are a Coen Brothers fan, you will certainly appreciate it. If not, it is quite a decent movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Bardem was truly scary,"I have been around scary people for much of my life and have scared a hell of a lot of people whom I think deserved to be frightened. I spent two years in Vietnam, worked in prisons, with alcoholics and addicts and mentally ill street people who occasionally, unmedicated, can get pretty worrisome. I've found myself on the wrong end of too many guns. A white guy, I've lived in ghettos. I've been around more than my share of heavily armed and angry drunks. I've been attacked with murderous intent in foreign countries and while riding a motorcycle on U.S. rural roads, a la Easy Rider.Despite this, I can only think of a few instances in my life when I have been truly afraid, such as when I've fought a raging forest fire with middling chances of escape, and being in the middle of an ocean in a hurricane on a small ship.I'm not someone who is easily able to suspend disbelief. I have found few science fiction movies of any interest, save for comedies such as ""Mars Attacks."" None have been fear provoking.But sitting there with my wife in a darkened theater, I found Javier Bardem's portrayal of Anton to be truly a frightening and believable character. From his first encounter with a storekeeper, he was completely convincing. When he had the upper hand over a competitor assassin and he was described by the latter as ""a psychopath,"" I thought, ""Well, that sure fits.""The only thing I couldn't understand was the failure of a character (trying to avoid a spoiler here) to dare the coin toss. People cling so tightly to life, it seemed difficult to believe.What a great movie. What great actors and directors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coen Brothers make a masterpiece,No Country for Old Men is a masterpiece of cinema and The best Pictur winner of 2007. It is based off of Cormac McCarthy's novel and is beautifully well done. The photography of the west is stunning as is the acting. You see what the west symbolizes is a time when law and order existed along wit justice. But as characters like Sheriff Bell realize that time is over. Javier Bardem is simply chilling as the psychopathic killer Anton Chigurh. Llewyen Moss is a simple married man until his life changes forever when he discovers 2 million dollars in the west along with bloodshed.

Gripping but ultimately disappointing,"Overall the movie was a little disappointing given the hype and the accolades.The film is often gripping and the actors do an excellent job given the lack of dialogue but I found it depressing. It's not a movie I would want to see again.Josh Brolin plays a welder who comes across a drug deal gone wrong. He escapes with $2 million of cash belonging to some Mexican gangsters. The main bad guy is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) a psychopathic hit-man with a bad haircut. Brolin is chased across west Texas by Anton who wants to recover the money. A lot of people die and it's not always clear why. Tommy Lee Jones plays an ineffectual sheriff-philosopher who fails to stop the carnage. Depending on your viewpoint Anton Chigurh is either a deranged lunatic or an instrument of the devil. Either way, a couple of hours in his company doesn't give you a better understanding of the human condition or what motivates him. The film peters out at the end and you are left wondering about the film's message. It also gives the impression that people in west Texas talk slowly and live in poverty.Many acclaimed U.S. directors achieve their greatest critical successes making movies about monosyllabic gunmen who kill indiscriminately. Gratuitous violence is starting to seem like a form of pornography, but Tarantino and Scorcese have shown it's an easy way to make an acclaimed movie. You don't need to bother with eloquent speeches or require much of a plot. You just need a creepy killer and some imaginative butchery. One can only speculate wonder how future generations will view the honors heaped on this type of film and our fascination with mindless violence.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

After more than six months, I have to say it should be my most loved movie. Really. Actors performance is as good as camera and script, strong part of this picture is also made by sound effects. If you liked ""There Will Be Blood"" or ""The Godfather"", you will enjoy this movie too. Well, it's full of violence, but not foundation less. It's like a jigsaw. Every detail connected with another. And that's the way I like it. And at the end I have to notice, that this movie, elsewhere it's violent in men-way, will enjoy also ladies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Unorthodox, memorable, thought-provoking","There is nothing mainstream about Oscar Best Picture winner No Country for Old Men, so don't expect a crowd-pleaser.Unorthodox in its pacing, derisive humor, thought-provoking sequences and uh, weaponry, directors Ethan and Joel Coen leave a lot for the audience's interpretation (reportedly more illuminated in the book by Cormac Macarthy) but throws in a number of memorable scenes.Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) is a hunter that stumbles upon a case of cash from a drug-deal gone wrong. He makes the mistake of returning to the scene of the crime and the hunter becomes the hunted: by Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), the police led by Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) and the Mexican mafia.Bardem deserves his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. You will think twice about laughing at a guy with a bowl cut again, nor someone that seems to innocently be holding a gas tank with a hose. He will also come to mind the next time you encounter a coin toss. In fact, his character steals so much from the rest of the movie that his face is all this movie's poster has to fill.Not that the rest of the cast don't deliver. It's just that it unravels so slowly, it's only in scenes where he appears that you sit up and really watch. Jones surprisingly plays a weak character here, and Harrelson has a small part, too (but apparently a personal one). Kelly Macdonald is a revelation as Llewelyn's wife, Carla Jean, who stands her own against Anton in their fateful meeting.The ending begs another discussion altogether.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Masterpiece of 2008,"I can't believe it, Coen Bros. did it just again ! I have seen this movie in a screening in Germany (thankfully it was not dubbed) and I can't believe there was actually some people being disappointed by the end (won't go too much into it as I don't wanna spoil any of it). Imho, those people simply didn't pay attention enough to the movie to actually understand why it ends like that, or they simply had way too different expectations.This movie is just simply put : a masterpiece. Acting? unbelievably good. The actors really stand out in this one. Javier Bardem is simply the perfect choice for this character. He looks great, goes really deep into character, and just makes you feel like you can, in some weird way, fully understand the role he plays. Josh Brolin? Heck, you'd think he's actually REALLY such a redneck ;-) And Woody Harrelson, well it's actually sad his role is more like a supporting character, as it's really done well and I think the movie would be way different without his role.The camera, the directing, the silent moments throughout the whole movie are just simply breathtaking ... It's been an incredibly long time since any major commerce-supported movie like that had been released (I know there's lots of such material in the independent scene, but remember, this actually is a Hollywood movie with true artistic quality ! A true rarity these days =P ).I wish I could buy the movie already, because I would really like to watch it over and over again ... and I am certainly not going to do the mistake and watch it in any dubbed language.

One Of Year's Best,"Words could not describe how I felt when I left the theater after watching this masterpiece. The Coen brothers prove again their excellence in the art of film-making with No Country For Old Men, starring Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bordem & Josh Brolin. The more I think about it, the more I realize how flawless this movie is.Javier Bordem, along with the other actors, play magnificent parts. Bordem plays one of the most realistic sociopath characters I have ever seen, and for that matter acts as good as I have ever seen. For anyone to believe There Will Be Blood had a better villain they are far mistaken. Bordem does not show near any emotion whatsoever, his lines are very clever, and proves his one-track mind will stop at nothing. ""You need to call it. I cannot call it for you. That would be unfair."" For some to believe it a slasher film, or one you must watch more than once to fully understand is untrue. There is definitely violence, and plenty of it in a rather Coens-esq fashion, but the story is positively excellent and the plot speeds up rather normally for a great conclusion.I tell anybody, preferably 14+, to check out this movie at least once. I went into it with just seeing the trailer once,no expectations, and I was blown away. A great, classic film, for sure to be watched by all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Something missing,"Well, it started perfectly that's what i saw, the movie made you keep watching till the end, but the problem was that probably the screenwriter wanted to do something different, he didn't want the typical plot where the bad boy gets caught and everyone is happy at the end, also he did not want to get the 3 characters to meet and you know that would result in a very complex scene with a bunch of action, but still, it felt like something it was missing, as a viewer you want to know why the bad guy is bad, but is never explained, several factors were not explained, so the movie had a very noticeable hole, however i'm not putting a very low rating because it had brilliant acting and cinematography. Also i understand that as a screenwriter you sometimes want to break the rules, i feel like this movie is a example of breaking the general structure of a script.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great thriller that will leave you thinking.,"This film from Ethan and Joel coen is their masterpiece (In my opinion). NCFOM is a breakaway from their usual quirky style and really gives you something to serious to watch and think about. All cast members give incredible performances especially Javier Bardem as the haunting Anton Chigurh. The film provides good action and incredible suspense, but also keeps you gripped in the non action scenes. There is also a lot of symbolism and running themes throughout the movie, and they leave an incredible impression. The movie illustrates the changing state of the world. That is really the main theme and it is excellently expressed. The cinematography in this film is also incredible. Although it is just the barren west, it is portrayed with incredible light and shadow.

"No Country for Old Men, Exceptional.....","No Country For Old Men ReviewI have to admit I knew absolutely nothing about this film before watching it, never saw a trailer, or nothing. All I knew is that many people were saying it should be the film of the year and IMDb's 8.6 Rating. Much like ""There Will be Blood"" I came into the theater with a clean slate not knowing at all what to expect and what the movie was about. When the movie ended all I could do is sit with my mouth agape as a million thoughts and questions ran through my mind. This is an epic movie, a movie which makes you think philosophically and moralistically , makes you appreciate characters, makes you appreciate the art depicted so masterfully in not only the acting, but the cinematography and even lack of musical score and a movie that you will never figure out with just one sitting, its a movie worth watching over and over again. A modern classic.Genre: Action/DramaThe Good: There are so many things that are not good, but utterly EXCEPTIONAL in this movie. From the acting, which is exceptional by everyone in this movie to, well everything else. Josh Brolin is excellent as the conflicted resourceful protagonist Llewlyn Moss, Tommy Lee Jones as the nostalgic reflective observer sheriff Ed Tom Bell and one of the most haunting performance by Javier Bardem as the destructive personification of death with an airgun, Anton ""Sugar"" Chigurh. Anton is truly chilling in all his scenes, with a memorable and unique demeanor and appearance as well as philosophy in life. Everyone else in their supporting cast is excellent as well. The cinematography is awesome as well. The lonely Rio Grande Desert landscapes are hauntingly amazing, especially with lack of musical score. The violent scenes and lack thereof also give a unique approach to this movie. The setting of Texas, 1980 is also done perfectly. The unconventional ending is also that was welcomed for me, although to many people it was disappointing, I found it extremely refreshing. The reflective monologues used by the Sheriff to reflect on changing times is also something that for me was almost Shakespearian in nature. Also the questions the movie will leave you asking enhances its overall quality.The Bad: Nothing, I got confused a few times on some of the roles of the minor characters, but this is a movie I will watch over and over again. Many will be disappointed with the unconventional ending, I loved it. Many will also not like a movie that makes you ask so many questions, to me that enhances the replay value infinitely. Many will also not like at the exclusion of some key and violent scenes, ala ""Reservoir Dogs"". But to me it makes this film as unique and as refreshing as possible.The Ugly: Antons overall destructiveness, but being zapped by his powerful airgun through your neck is a terrifying scene in the movie.Overall, one of the best films I have ever seen. To me this film is more entertaining and as deep as ""There Will be Blood"". The acting is also comparable, To me they are about equal, as well as cinematography. The one thing that makes this better than ""There Will Be Blood"" is the entertainment factor. This film is more entertaining in various aspects. A movie that will definitely be in my collection and should be in your too.Supra Score - 9.7/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

But lots of room for dead ones,"So it's a well constructed film featuring a central villain who's uncharacteristically laconic and sadistic at the same time which is something original, but the narrative is shallow and the plot sometimes seems aimless. Jones is a retiring lawman who must investigate a spate of murders committed by Bardem, sporting a creepy hairstyle and an unusual choice of weapon in a pneumatic cattle gun. Junior Brolin is the opportunistic rancher who happens on a drug deal gone sour, seeking to profit from the mini massacre, but Bardem has other ideas and tracks his prey across the south-west.Jones is a tired looking bystander to the carnage created by the man of the moment, Javier Bardem whose star rose to prominence following his Oscar nod for this jolting, unhinged performance. Woody Harrelson has a good scene or two as a professional mercenary and pale imitation of Bardem's commitment to his chosen profession, while Tess Harper has a minor role as Jones' wife, and Barry Corbin and Stephen Root feature in supporting roles.Characterised by the typical Coen brothers style, it's epic in length and paced like a snail on valium, but thankfully, punctuated by some shocking encounters that make it a memorable experience. Not a bad film at all, but whether it's worthy of being declared the best film of its year either inflates its worth or reflects poorly on the competition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The genre of the 'psychopathic murderer' movie.,"With it's lavish cinematography (Roger Deakins), the sheriffs (Tommy Lee Jones) rambling hick rationalism's and Carter Burwell's eerie music setting, this movie lures you into a desolate, desperate and dangerous world. In fact, no country for old men. In this respect the movie faithfully delivers.However, the leitmotif of this movie is pursuit. We watch two pursuits being played out. One is the sheriff's, to catch the murderous and chillingly portrayed psychopath, Chigurh (Javier Bardem). The other is Chigurh's pursuit of Llewelwyn (Josh Brolin) to recover a huge bounty of drug money.This story framework, set against the beautiful and stark Texan landscape, powerfully delivers the 'psychopathic murderer' movie genre. The Coen brothers deserve recognition for giving us something entertaining, but unlike movies of the same genre such as Terence Mallicks 'Badlands', it doesn't carry the same creative punch.This is a one to see, albeit you'll need a strong stomach, as it dwells on gruesome images in the style of a horror movie.In the end, the movie abandons you with the 'wounded animal is a dangerous animal' idea.

mesmerising,"No Country For Old MenNo Country for Old Men is mesmerising. It pulls you in and doesn't let go. It's basically a moral cat and mouse story, about the repercussion of people's decisions and actions. The acting is top notch, Josh Brolin is an actor that has never been too memorable on-screen, that all changes here. He plays Texan everyman Llewellyn Moss. This could well be a career-changing performance for him. Javier Bardem is pure evil personified, and burns with menace. Every time he appears, you expect bad things to happen. The scene where he mercilessly picks on a gas station owner is uncomfortable brilliance. The Coen brothers script is sharp and witty, and plays so real, you always feel like you are eves-dropping on someone else's conversations, or spying on their actions, rather than hearing words said for your benefit.""

Memorable dialog,"Well, a lot of very strong opinions in the comments section. I'm guessing that the Coens would consider that a success. I thought that the film had some very strong points. Excellent acting from Jones, Bardem, Harrelson, Brolin, and Kelly Macdonald. Nice photography and sets. (I'm pretty sure that I have stayed at one of the hotels in Las Vegas, New Mexico that served as one of them) Some memorable dialog, that may have been lifted from the McCarthy novel. Some of the extreme nihilism was a bit off-putting, but that was obviously the point. A big problem was the ending. I hate to criticize a film for being unconventional, because formulaic endings can be bad, too.

This discovery sets off a chain of events involving a relentless hitman named Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem, and a weary sheriff, Ed Tom Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones. The cat-and-mouse chase between Moss and Chigurh is thrilling, and some scenes, like the one in the motel where Chigurh uses the air gun, are absolutely unforgettable.The acting in this movie is top-notch. Javier Bardem as Chigurh is incredibly menacing, and his performance alone makes the movie worth watching. Tommy Lee Jones also gives a great performance as the sheriff who feels outmatched by the violence around him.However, there were parts of the movie that dragged for me. Some of the slower, more reflective scenes felt a bit too long and made me lose some interest. It's not that I thought any part of the movie was bad; it's just that the pacing didn't always hold my attention.I can see why this movie is so beloved. The Coen Brothers did a fantastic job creating a tense and atmospheric film, and the cinematography is beautiful. The themes of fate and inevitability are handled really well, and the ending, although it left me a bit puzzled, fits perfectly with the movie's overall tone.Overall, while ""No Country for Old Men"" didn't completely blow me away, I still think it's a good movie with some truly memorable moments. I understand why it has such a strong following and why many consider it a modern classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Extremely overrated,"Had great promise first half of the movie, then it started a jet fueled haul towards rock bottom, but it didn't exactly hit rock bottom, it actually made a big crater on the impact, and by doing that, it went beyond rock bottom.This movie was solemnly created for people who either consider themselves intellectual, or/and belong to the elite critics.Do not watch this 2 hour endlessly long movie, you will have a better time spending those two hours looking into the sun with no protection.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Violence, Emptiness, and Flashes of Dark Humor","The Cormac McCarthy novel NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is an ideal vehicle for the Coen brothers, who have used violence and emptiness laced with dark humor as an artistic aesthetic since the beginning of their careers--and although the setting and story are quite different it is very, very like FARGO in mood, style, and themes.The story concerns Texan Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who stumbles across the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad, takes the money, and runs. He is pursued by hit man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem); both are pursued by sheriff Tom Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones.) Curiously, the film never allows any of the three men to meet; it instead follows their various paths toward and away from each other, paths that cross, diverge, and at times seem quite random.Although the characters drive the story in the sense that they make the decisions they do because of who they are, the overall impression of the film is one of an initially calculated violence that becomes increasingly random as it progresses. There is no ultimate reason or deep meaning; just an open-ended emptiness of non-resolution and futility.The cast is quite good, with Brolin, Bardem, and Jones perfectly cast and extremely believable in their roles; Kelly MacDonald, who plays the role of Llewelyn's wife, is particularly fine. The production values are also memorable. But like most Coen films, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN seems to skate on the surface of its story rather than offer it to us in depth--the idea, one presumes, to allow us to impose our own ideas upon its very carefully crafted blankness. In this instance it works more often than not, but it is extremely noticeable when it doesn't, and the film often reads as self-consciously quirky as a result.The DVD contains three backstory documentaries including a ""making of"" piece; in truth, however, all three are of a piece. Recommended, but not to all tastes.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Pearl Amongst Swine,"Just recently my enthusiasm for contemporary cinema has been waning. Clever, but formulaic scripts, contrived plots, and painting by number incidents. Then something comes along which shakes all that up -and ""No Country For Old Men"" does that.The cinematography is lush, the desert settings evocative, and the key characters get a very welcome chance to breathe for once.Its style pays homage to the great westerns, and Tommy Lee Jones as veteran Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell lends an elegiac, ""fin de siecle"" feel to proceedings.The violence is graphic and bloody,the script wordy,reflective and wry,but the Coen brothers show a discipline throughout which Tarrantino would do well to note.The gruesome slaughter which pervades this film is shown in a wholly amoral manner. Life and death a matter of chance - won or lost on the toss of a coin, both metaphorically and literally.When required, the set piece action scenes never fail to disappoint. Equally there are spoken stretches where nothing much happens, other than enriching our appreciation of both character and plot, rare indeed.The end is sudden, and requires careful attention to the opening, as well as the closing, monologue - and almost requires a second viewing, which is no bad thing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
- Hunter Becomes Bait  A Story About Keeping Promises & Consequences -,"-Hunter Becomes Bait  A Story About Keeping Promises & Consequences.-After a long wait, the Oscar-rumoured No Country for Old Men, came into European cinemas and immediately I went to see if this film was worth all the prizes it won and the attention it got. Asking this question is, of course, answering it.Let me first say that I'm not a die-hard Coen bros. fan. I love(d) The Big Lebowski, O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Fargo and the unforgettable Miller's Crossing. However some of their early movies, like Raising Arizona and Barton Fink, weren't really my thing. Matter of taste, I guess. With their latest, No Country for Old Men, they delivered a perfect blend of different genres while keeping the style and tone that's so typical Coen.The plot is pretty (blood)simple actually. 'Man finds money from a drug deal gone wrong, which leads to other men coming after him to get back their money.' The way this violence-packed, western-crime-drama story is told, and shot (cinematographically) comes to life on the big screen in a way that is without a doubt beyond the words that will follow.'Set somewhere in a country next to the Mexican-American border where the wonderful south-western accents sounded so incomprehensible that I am glad there were subtitles.'""Josh Brolin plays a man who, while shooting deer in the desert, finds some dead Mexicans, guns, a truckload full of drugs and a bag of money. Naturally he keeps the 2 million crispy dollars and when the story unfolds the questions rise: 'What's the money really worth?' or 'What's the price of money?' From that moment on his life changes. He's being chased after where ever he goes and has to watch every step he takes. And the bait seems to be inventive enough to do so quite well.""All the (other) actors also do a great job but Gran Canarian Javier Bardem (Spain) really stands out playing a man who's hired to return the dollars to its 'rightful' owners. People will see him as a ruthless killer which, of course, he is. But this 'bad guy' certainly keeps his promises and lives up to the few words he speaks. Tommy Lee Jones does a terrific job, playing a cop with a history what lead him to develop an indifferent look at the world. Once he gets involved Jones, like the audience, is destined to find out what is happening and hereby questioning (criticizing/commenting) his (our) way of life. And not to forget about the small, yet great part of Woody Harrelson: unforgettable.Most of the Coen's movies could be seen as crime movies and/or classic comedy. This movie however throws all different kinds of genres in the mix. They easily switch from western to crime and from drama to the darkest of dark humour. Joel and Ethan manage to do this without and maybe because of a total lack of a music score which I didn't even get onto until the credits began to role..And, mostly at a very slow pace, the movie glides so perfectly well from one genre to the other, so you never get the idea you are really watching more movies than just the one you paid for.A couple of words to describe this movie-experience: magnificent & mesmerizing, incomprehensible & unforgettable, beautiful & breathtaking.(Today, No Country for Old Men earned 4 Academy Awards in the categories: Best Film, Best Director, Best Script and Best Actor (Bardem) in a Supporting Role)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very powerful Coen Bros. film,"No Country for Old Men is a powerful thriller filmed to perfection by Joel and Ethan Coen. The performances are searing but what really wins this film over is the Coens' inventive techniques in creating suspense, throwing in comic relief, and finally having a quirky but effective choreography of violence. It's a potent thriller full of great shots of the landscape and the suspense techniques intelligently use brutal violence and plenty of great camera work. Bardem gives his strongest performance of his career as the killer. The symbolism and cultural satire the Coens throw in is that of two filmmakers who know how to powerfully create both a violent and very humorous film in the same shot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Perfect,"For the ones that didn't like the ending, you either didn't understood it or you are just plain stupid. People expect a Hollywood, narrowed-minded, classical ending, and the Coen brothers are excellent filmmakers, so they are not going to go that direction. They only used the plot to express their idea (and Cormac McCarthy's) This is no country for old men anymore people! Violence and the thirst for money is destroying our world, and this is represented by Anton Chigurh (Javier Brdem creates the most memorable character of 2007). I'm not going to tell or explain the ending. I'm not saying I got it the first time. I had to watch it twice, but let me tell you...it is worth the effort. Just listen carefully to the character played beautifully by Tommy Lee Jones. That's the key to unlock the powerful meaning of this picture.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Cinematic greatness.. nice.,"Okay this comment goes out to ScottDeLane who abused up this movie like anything. Well, No Country For Old Men, isn't your average movie.

And to put it straight, yes, No Country For Old Men too is unconventional.Provided the storyline is questionable, but c'mon, its Cormac Mcarthy. How can you question that anyways? No Country.. is cinematic brilliance. It wont be a surprise to see this movie among the Top 50 of all time. But, thats about it. The storyline takes the movie nowhere.

The Coen's Trek Through Antonioni Territory,This is an unusual film to win the best picture Oscar . On the surface it's merely a violent thriller where someone has the dubious luck of finding a stash of hot money only to find the money has brought them problems far beyond their worst nightmareWhat makes the film different from an average thriller is the borrowings from the Italian autuer Michealangelo Antonioni . The Coen's have made an unrepently art house thriller . This may have alienated a lot of its potential audience but it sticks in the memory of those who have seen itIt's an enigmatic film and the enigma carries through to the character subplots . Characters die ( Or possibly not die ) off screen which mirrors the work of Antonioni in THE PASSENGER There's also little sense of time . If it wasn't for references to Vietnam you'd believe it was a contemporary setting . The shot length is rather long for a modern American film and this is in no way a criticism . It is probably the Coen's best film and one that is unlikely they'll top,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
AMAZING!!! Oscar???,"This was a phenomenal movie. Period. When it first started, I was skeptical about the story, and I thought it may be a bit boring... however, as it progressed and the Coen brothers exposed the inventive characters more and more, I grew more and more impressed.If there was one movie which I had to compare this to by the Coen brothers, it would have to be Blood Simple b/c of the raw cinematic feeling that it provides.While certainly inventive, this film also respected the classic western genre with an eerie lack of dialogue, and imposing, unpredictable characters.This film is definitely a must!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Interesting,"I did not want to give it 10. I wanted to give it 9.5 because of the loose ends (not explained, I mean) and the sudden end.But that may well be the beauty of it. I am going to remember that scene where Chigurh checks his boots.This film is obviously open to interpretations but a nice story, nonetheless. What starts as a 'what will happen' suspense leads to some 'what will happen' philosophy and all characters put in their best.I had to read a few other comments here to actually understand the movie - the accent was so hard. But that is the setting of the movie - so I cannot complain.The whole film is somehow based around this psychological case study called Anton Chigurh. His character has been so well brought out in the movie that Bardem HAD TO perform well to survive in this role. He did a good job but I am not sure if he deserved so many awards and the Oscar for this one role. This is more a movie than a one-man story.Some people are angry about this movie getting a better deal than 'There will be Blood' at the academy. I liked TWBB for its performances but I am with the academy on this. I watched TWBB before this and I feel this is the kind of movie that would make one reduce the rating for TWBB. Basically, both the movies are good and will appeal to a wide set of, often common, audiences. Then on, it becomes a matter of personal choice. My vote still goes to NCFOM which I think is a supreme movie.I'll NEED to watch this again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A very worthwhile watch,"While the critics were in awe of this film, I do not rate it quite so highly but its still a great film!The story is somewhat ""par for the course"" as a Hunter comes across a drug deal gone bad and steals the Money that was left only to be hunted down by a hit-man.It is Anton Sugar that steals the show - His whole attitude throughout the whole film is just menacing...Through most of the film you spend your time trying to understand him and his motives - And that's about it!There is little to say other than the film has some amazing acting performances and introduces the most amazing ""Killer"" who you somehow end up feeling closer to than any other character in the whole film.A great film!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A movie that's both art and entertainment; absolutely terrific,"No Country for Old Men became my favorite movie of all time instantly. It is so close to being the perfect film with it's immense amount of suspense, solid dialog and it's meaningful characters that develop the movie's theme.The western background creates an excellent setting for this movie. The opening sequence is great as it shows all the landscape of Texas. A monologue takes place and sets up the western feel. And how can that southern accent be unlikable? It's appealing and contributes to the western atmosphere.The characters work because they are very well portrayed by splendid actors with a screenplay of crisp dialog. The dialog is out of the everyday life. There are no punts, no one liners but good, short yet stylish dialog. The three main characters slightly remind me of the ones in the Good the Bad and the Ugly. The whole movie is a three man chase and from the movie we all know that they are all very intelligent characters. The characters are easy to be hooked on. Anton Chigurh is the perfect villain; fair yet homicidal. Moss can be a greedy man yet has a soft spot from time to time. And finally Ed Tom is a man who does not understand the cruelty of the present world. The trio create a perfect combination.No Country for Old Men is an outstanding thriller and is a role model to future neo-western thrillers. It stays true to it's source material and shows it's true meaning that the book wanted to convey which makes this movie an excellent piece of art. While the movie is criticized for ending abruptly, again it's staying true to its source material.This movie is crazy. It keeps you in suspense throughout and when it's over it makes a good transition into developing it's theme. There is almost no music and when it comes to an intense situation, it's completely silent, creating more suspense. There are not many violence depicted in the movie but the things that happen off screen are disturbing, creating a mental image. The Coen brothers do a fantastic job of keeping true to the thriller genre.There's not much to say when it comes to the effects. I felt that everything was authentic. There are some bits of good gore that portray the necessary violence. Every violence in this film has a purpose unlike a bottom material action film. The violence contributes to the film's theme.Because this is a Coen brothers film, it has some dark comedy. The hair of Anton Chigurh is one of the primary examples. You'll see a lot of this during the film yet the movie never loses it's seriousness.This is the comeback of the western genre and a great adaptation of one of the greatest books on humanity. The movie is filled with philosophy, thought provoking questions. This is the classic film people will look back to in the future. No Country for Old Men is an upgrade from all the previous Coen brother movies; it's more modernly done in a positive way yet feels like their movie. The Coens have shown us an example of what cinema should be like: art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Mention of Comanche County,"When I saw ""No Country for Old Men"" I was very surprised to hear Comanche County mentioned; the beginning dialogue stated that a certain Comanche County sheriff never wore a gun; his name was given as ""Gaston Borkins."" I believe that would have really been Gaston Boykin, who was Comanche County sheriff two different times in two different decades; his wife was a distant cousin of mine on my dad's side. I grew up in Comanche, Texas, and have traveled many times by car or train through extremely desolate parts of West Texas; in the movie, many of the scenes looked very familiar; on the other hand, there are undoubtedly many parts of West Texas that are relatively unexplored and would prove to be a safe haven for the likes of Anton.Cheryl Braziel Montoya",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Exciting and unforeseeable,"This movie creates a suspense with not much, just a look sometime does it. Still enough too create a certain atmosphere that deserves 10 of 10 Stars. If it's the killer or the policeman, everybody plays his role like it should be done, composed, real. The Texas style way too speak, the dessert apply perfectly in the scenario giving the extra thrill. It just takes you away, from start too finish. Not much film can do this, this one can. Every Oscar he got, is deserving therefor. Directly considered a all time top 50 film. Too tell the truth, this is the best film I've seen in a while, n maybe the last 6 years, that's how good he is!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Almost a horror movie at times, this is one fantastic thriller and one of the Coens' best","I'm not sure one viewing can do this film justice. It leaves a lot to think about, and I spent a good portion of my Sunday reading other people's views to see if I can come to some sort of conclusion about it. But I can't yet. Well, I can come to the conclusion, in any case, that this is a fantastic movie. There's no doubt about that. The Coens go back to their darker, noir-inspired sides, making the barren Texas landscape feel as cold as the Minnesota winter. The central story has a Vietnam veteran, played by Josh Brolin, finding a bundle of cash on the scene of a drug deal gone wrong. Meanwhile, a methodical killer by the name of Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) hunts him down. On the sidelines is an aging sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) who works something like a Greek chorus, commenting on the main action but never able to have any effect on it. Looked at as a simple piece of film-making, No Country is brilliant. The Coens create a couple of the best setpieces they've ever done. They crank the tension up so high that I  along with the entire audience  was holding my breath. This is the closest thing the Coens have ever made to a horror movie, too. At times, it reminded me of a slasher, where we're waiting to see Chigurh dispose of his next victim in a gruesome way. But unlike your common director of a slasher movie, the Coens know how to make movies. It's not enjoyable when someone gets killed here. It feels all too realm and frankly it was scaring the hell out of me at times. Bardem plays the most memorable movie monster of the current decade. The character even sees himself as a monster, of sorts, as a hand of fate. In that way, Chigurh reminds me of another movie character, Ryunosuke Tsukue, Tatsuya Nakadai's character in Kihachi Okamoto's Sword of Doom. The two films share some similarities (surely unintentionally), for example the almost Brechtian dodge of a conventional climax that forces us to reconsider what  and who  the films are actually about. I think one big question that I've come up with is whether the film sees Chigurh as a force of nature, or whether it is just Chigurh seeing himself that way, and that he is as much subject to the forces of nature and fate as anyone else in the story. No Country started to lose me a little when it went after some big themes at the end. I feel like I didn't absorb everything there was, and maybe I just didn't ""get"" what the authors (the Coens and Cormac McCarthy, with whose work I'm entirely unfamiliar outside of this film) were going for. But I also have a sneaking suspicion that the big themes get a little lost, that the Coens don't accomplish everything they set out to do. But I am eager to see this again  and again  to see if I can work it all out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A villain that can rival The Joker,"Amongst the 5 nominated films for last year's best film for the Oscar, this is the only film that i give credit, and funny it reminds me of Dark Knight in every aspect. It superseded my expectations as, besides the fact that the villain is cool (in fact i would say he can rival The Joker in Dark Knight himself) the movie dives deeper into a bigger picture as the story flows and that itself is amazing feat. Controversial issues that are relevant even to today's society is being brought up in style. Thus, like the Dark Knight, this film is bigger than the story itself. Truly extraordinary, intriguing, and deserving for the Oscar nominations of that year.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A powerful and uncompromising film,"No Country for Old Men, the Coen brothers' brilliant adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's bloody lament for a vanished America, hits the ground running. A prisoner, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), turns himself into the police then strangles a Sheriff's deputy with the chain of his handcuffs and escapes. Stealing a police car, he pulls over a driver and murders him with a device used for slaughtering cattle. In the author's words, ""He placed his hand on the man's head like a faith healer, the pneumatic hiss and click of the plunger sounded like a door closing."" That is only the beginning of the myriad violent deaths in this dark and brutal saga that is without any sympathetic characters, just the hunter and the hunted, each, however, with a kind of integrity that hints at redemption beyond the apocalypse.Set along the Texas-Mexico border in 1980, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a welder and Vietnam veteran hunting antelope near the Rio Grande stumbles upon dead bodies and abandoned vehicles, the result of a drug deal gone badly. Fully aware of the risks but with the clarity of John Grady Cole, Moss takes a suitcase filled with two million dollars and heads out in his truck. Thinking about a dying man's request for water, Moss returns to the scene, however. It is not long before he is discovered, shot at, and forced on the run for the remainder of the film. Pursued by Chigurh and the men who want their money back, the film becomes a tense chase thriller with an uncertain outcome.To add to the closing net, Moss is also tracked by a discouraged sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and Carson Wells, a hired representative from the drug cartel (Woody Harrelson). As he tries to escape, he must also protect his wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) from threats from the sadistic killer who kills because it is there. ""I'm not sure why I did this"", Chigurh says, ""but I think I wanted to see if I could extricate myself by an act of will. Because I believe that one can. That such a thing is possible."" He considers himself the representative of fate. ""Every moment in your life is a turning and every one a choosing. Somewhere you made a choice. All followed to this. The accounting is scrupulous. The shape is drawn. No line can be erased.""In a film in which all the performances are universally excellent, Bardem stands out as the screen's most implacable villain in many years, conveying an unrelenting sense of menace even though we never get beneath the surface of his character. As he struggles against what the film calls ""the dismal tide"", the reflective Sheriff Bell can only ask in Jones' twangy voice, ""Who the hell are these people?"" His granddaddy only had to deal with cattle rustlers but now there are drug dealers to whom casual killing is a way of life. He says, ""I ain't sure we've seen these people before. Their kind."" Bell is not a pessimist. He is simply exhausted and feels powerless.""I don't know hat to do about em even"", he ruminates. ""If you killed em all they'd have to build an annex on to hell"". Relentless in its heartbreaking sadness, No Country for Old Men is a powerful and uncompromising film, a lament for what America has lost and an outcry against what it has become, a society inured to violence where murder and rape is a coin toss and war is an event that is woven into the fabric of our life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Well made and linear,"Very good the Javier Bardem's interpretation and the way in which identifies himself with the part, maybe sometimes the movie is too much bloody but all in all is a good cinematic representation of the book. This is, in fact, one of the best book-to-film adaptations I've ever seen, both in terms of a close following of the text, and in terms of playing out the author's intentions rather than undermining or erasing them. But the book instead, it's more thematically consistent, thanks to the Bell interludes, which open, close, and space out the book, making it more clearly about him and his conviction that America is falling apart, becoming the kind of place where fellows like him just don't belong.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Brutal, Tense and Violently Poetic.","Plot:Texas, 1980. Hunting in the desert, Llewellyn Moss (Brolin) comes across the wreckage of a drug deal gone wrong and takes the cash  without counting on the man sent after him, an implacable killer (Bardem) intent on recovering the loot at any cost.My Review:The Coens have been off their game, they have been off their rocker with a short number of okay flicks. This time, the genre they tackle changes format completely. The Coens have rediscovered their mojo; with added humanity and Viagra.A from Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Cormac McCarthy's violent neo-Western, No Country For Old Men encompasses blood, guts, gun galore, sharply and tense woven plot with a lusciously written script. It's got Blood and lots of Balls, sense of death lurking in the barren dry Texan landscape that has some flamboyant cinematography. And being a knotted tale of crime innately wrapped in circumstantial regards.Surprisingly foremost is how the film remains both recognisably to McCarthy's allegory, all the while being soaked in oil-black humour. With the entire jazzy corollary that the Coen's use at their detriment, with witty deadpan comebacks. ""If I don't come back, tell my mother I love her,"" Josh Brolin's anti-hero Llewellyn Moss tells his wary discerning wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) before he faces hell. ""Your mother's dead,"" she retorts. ""Then I'll tell her myself,"" he sighs.Sweltering corpses cook in the thirty-plus degree desert sun, even a dead dog, and a trail of blood, with the same splinter of the recent ' The Assassination of Jess James by the coward Robert Ford' indomitable likeness, splattered like ink along the parched ground, leads Moss to a case containing two million dollars. He takes to the money and runs. We consequentially start eyeing the tremulous determination of Moss, a local hunter who happens upon the remains of a drug deal gone badly wrong. The plot is triple-headed, with the narrative shifting focus whenever one of the leads seems to be taking centre stage, some more than others.The clean-up guy is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), who is totally underestimated throughout. A killer with the implacable dedication and blend of a Cylon from 'Battlestar Galactica' and Terminator; with a haircut to match, with a psychopathic sense of hypocrisy, irony and striking intelligence. Even Carter Burwell's score is defined by its candid  made up only of groans and eerie whistles. Course with that being said, the score only builds up at the roll of the credits. Bardem's is the role with a unbelievable amount of possibilities  a stone-cold killer obsessed, leaving to fate and chance to decide the lives of the ones he holds to the flip of a random toss of a quarter. He is blank force made breathtakingly plausible.A startling chase set of events leads to shootings shot to perfect, brutal and tense graphical scenes that really make that +18 or R rating stand out in a dry soaked red. Always two steps behind is the old man of the tale, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a lawman up for retirement, facing an evil that he can no longer decode.It is true to the book, even when the end is like a downplay and ambiguous laden message instead of a crescendo-ed glorified good guy v.s bad guy.Verdict:Colourfully and visually beguiling; as tense, sharp and brutal as some Western depictions. One of the best of 2007. 9/10. Watch for the coin toss scene with Bardem and a shopkeeper.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A movie you cant miss. A big Oscar contender,"Excellent movie. A brilliant adaptation from Cormac McCarthy's novel with the unique touch of the Coen brothers. Its a film full of action, drama, suspense and some of the characteristic Coen Black humor, a journey full of tension that will keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours. It has a very interesting story about a Vietnam veteran who finds a bag with two million dollars, this situation unleashes a persecution between the veteran and a psycho killer looking for the money and a investigation of the local sheriff. The cast is simply wonderful, Josh Brolin gives a perfect acting as Llewelyn Moss, Javier Bardem's flawless performance earned him a Oscar nomination, totally worthy in my opinion.

movie (amazing) / haters (funny),"i'm not sure if i even think that the movie is a ten, but i felt compelled to attempt to 're-cancel' out the idiotic 'i give it a 1 because you're all crazy' vote.the movie, simply put - was brilliant.not much i have to say about the movie that hasn't been said in previous posts.there are two really, REALLY obvious things that a lot of posters on this site need to understand, though:1. this is as accurate a film adaptation of a book that has been made in a long time. (guy is a Pulitzer winning author, Coen's are award winning directors - several of which are from this title) my point is that if the three of them can't explain a story in a way you can understand...it probably isn't their fault.&2. if you've never been to west Texas, keep your inaccurate assumptions about its people and scenery to yourself. oh and being a snob on the internet makes people laugh at you...just like when you do it in real life (Danusha_Goska ... i'm talking to you).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Great, but what gives?","At the conclusion of ""No Country for Old Men"" I thought the Coen Brothers gave me and the audience ""the finger"". After 2 hours of mesmerizing storytelling with the brilliant cinematography of Roger Deakins, the movie endswithout a discernible third act. I will cop to being obtuse. Instead of giving ""the finger"" back, I acknowledge the masterpiece at work with Writers and Directors Ethan and Joel Coen. The performances are astounding from Tommy Lee Jones, Josh Brolin, and Javier Bardem. Bardem as the sociopath killer Anton Chigurh is powerful, and deserves to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.""No Country for Old Men"" on the surface glorifies sociopath professional killer Chigurh (Bardem) in his mission to retrieve $2 millionat least on the surface. The Coen Brothers never manufacture any insight into the ruthless and nearly indestructible Chigurh. Tommy Lee Jones's Sheriff Ed Bell's resolution is poignant in keeping with the title, and hinting a possible future, but is completely out of context. Even if the Coens intend this as a great existential treatise, it is overly indulgent and does not work. There is no compelling catharsis to ""No Country for Old Men"". Having a catharsis about either the good or evil in men would have been welcome. Here one just seems missing. Even reflecting upon the ending I kept expecting to see Pam Ewing seeing Bobby in the shower on that infamous episode of ""Dallas"". What happened here? I get that exploration into human darkness and ambiguous endings equate to movie gravitas. However, here I wonder how much of this is the Directors' arrogance?Set in 1980, ""No Country for Old Men"" opens multi-textured. On a deer hunting trip Lewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) discovers a massacre in the middle of nowhere. The scene is an apparent drug deal gone awry: murdered bodies everywhere, a shipment of heroin, and $2 million. Chigurh brutally escapes local sheriffs' custody and begins a merciless killing rampage. The cold blooded Chigurh is singular in focus, and chillingly displays mastery at what he does. Lewelyn returns to his trailer home and wife Carla Jean (good Kelly Macdonald). Lewelyn does not know what to do next, but he knows that as long as he has the money both he and Carla Jean are in grave danger. Meanwhile in the city, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) meets with a mysterious man who wants him to locate Chigurh and the money. Carson confirms that Chigurh is a very bad man. Tommy Lee Jones as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell narrates the story's opening. His voice is tired and resigned, saying ""I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job - not to be glorious."" Jones embodies a battle worn weariness, and folksy common sense in Ed Tom. Soon all story threads converge, and Ed Tom must bring to justice the murderous Chigurh.The Coen brothers chillingly compel in their story of greed, murder, and betrayal. This certainly is no place for old men, who have grown weary of the evil that men can do and no longer have the resolve to do what is necessary. That may be simple speak; however, it may be appropriate for this tale. Given all the passionate and brilliant work, I think the Coens really disappoint in the end. Even if this is their existential masterpiece where both good and evil men survive in the world or that life really means nothing in a profound sense, at least complete a Third Act of a story. After investing 2 hours watching brilliant storytelling, at least have the humility to conclude the story in some recognizable manner.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Study in Frontier Logic,"No Country For Old Men is a film that is carefully, meticulously constructed to linger, which it does. It's a film that, despite its cold, ominous eccentricity, is very down-to-earth, pessimistic, and wise. It's imagined so precisely that many details will not dawn on you till later, the appearance of a limping dog early in the film for instance. The film progresses naturally, untouched by any sort of convention, vogue or standards, and moves by way of its deep-rooted outlooks and views.Visually, No Country For Old Men is of the highest cinematic order. The camera moves so deliberately and many images extract so many microcosms in life, a translucent reflection in a blown-out keyhole for example. Many shots rely more on a dooming presence in the out-of-focus background than in the unsuspecting foreground. Violence is portrayed on and offscreen as genuinely as this ungoverned yet restrained film possibly could. It's a standard-setting work of cinema, if that isn't shamelessly extreme in complement. It's so solid, you feel like you could go to Google Earth and rove around its settings finding no boundaries that divide the film set and the real external world. What I found to be outstanding, a strenuous thing to be in a film the sets the bar so high, is its use of sound, which very much opened my mind to the potential effects of the design of such in the movies. The film never uses music. Each scene is given seamless, faultless attention to ambient noises. In a hotel room, for instance, we hear that humming that we can never really locate. Also, there are at least two scenes where your heart is in your throat on account of the simple discerning of a transponder.In his third appearance in an incredible movie in 2007, following Grindhouse and Amerian Gangster, Josh Brolin gives the best performance I've ever seen from him. He completely embodies a sort that is very relatable and likely to do some of the questionable things that he does in the story, a shrewd pragmatist that is resourceful and invariably stubborn, intractible, and changelessly intent. He speaks few words, he's dry as desert sand, and does not think for one second about the consequences or alternate outcomes of his dangerous choices in the film. Hindsight and deliberation don't exist in his fixed and steadfast world. The chase that ensues as he sees practical possibilities as practical inevitability written in stone in taking $2 million from the site of a gruesomely fated heroin deal is to him something he must staunchly work through with a stone face.Javier Bardem, in the first film I have ever seen him in, is a presence to be reckoned with. He bears a knowing perception that telegraphs such a deeply dangerous villain. He's beyond the distance between audience and screen. He is so aware, precise, analytical, and thoughtful that he almost sees us peripherally. Pursuing the money that the narrowly engrossed Brolin has taken liberty of, he is what human beings have never faced or understood about fate. He has a mysterious philosophy that carries him serenely through a non-participating life of casual murder, perhaps that he somehow has reached an absolute certainty that there is no afterlife, that life is ultimately meaningless, and that his understanding of that existentialist conclusion admits him the privilege of controlling the fate of those he comes into contact with. How much of a match is Brolin against Bardem? The resourcefulness of the two men is transcendentally absorbingly suspenseful.Serving as the film's actual hero is perhaps Tommy Lee Jones, who plays a creaky, weathered small town sheriff who avoids the federal investigation of the incidental heroin deal to protectively pursue Brolin. His manner puts off the audience, yes. All of us who have seen this film in theaters will agree. But the key to his philosophies, idiosyncracies, and pontifications are in how he also puts off other characters. Jones, an actor who is often very deterring in how glacial and inexcitable he can be, is really the only actor I can fully and seriously imagine playing the sheriff. The beauty in the film's dooming, melancholy realism begins and ends with him, as someone who has preoccupied doubts, conscious inquiries, and learned understanding that he does not communicate. When he talks, he's saying things that make sense to his views but never his actual views. To those who he shares the screen with, as well as to us, he's an old man whose mind wanders, as he humbly admits in one scene.The three very incompatible key men never share a frame with one another, except for once very lucidly late in the film. How disconcerting, how painfully obstructing and displeasing. This is the ambiguous epitome of the film's consuming achievement. We are left wondering, pondering, and even if we don't, it lingers still. Images, lines, characters, scenes, they make our own minds wander the next day and the day after.Kelly MacDonald, the beautiful Scottish actress from Trainspotting and Gosford Park, has a authentically basic and second-class role, which a woman would in her character's place, as Brolin's wife who, despite having severe misgivings about her husband's steel-engraved plans to secure the money, she still cooperates. She is gently endearing in her performance. There is a scene where she does something that I normally can't stand in another person, which is making lip sounds. However, to my indescribable insatiability during that moment, she feels so tenderly real and pitiful and the scene takes a turn of my newfound investment in her.Despite the Coen brothers' trademark quirky character embellishments, everyone in the film is screamingly real. And that is why this film is so haunting. It may be dryly funny, off- putting, and subjective with the mindset and behavior of its West Texas characters, but it's all a part of the film's nitpicking at the frightening what-ifs of reality, of life on earth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Country for Old Men is a Great Flick in a Country of Bad Movies,"With so much crap churned out of Hollywood month after month lately it's refreshing to see a movie that actually piques my interest.Unlike most films I've see lately, where I can see the ending coming miles away like a freight train barreling down the tracks blowing it's horn, this movie's ending completely threw me for a loop and left me feeling a little betrayed. However, any movie that can invoke an emotion other than cheap laughs or ""oohs"" and ""ahs"" at the pretty CG action sequences is impressive.Josh Brolin plays ""Llewelyn Moss"" who is a simple Texas welder who lives in a trailer with his wife, and stumbles upon a fortune in a botched drug-deal while hunting in the Texas hill country. Although it's ill-begotten gains for Llewelyn you sympathize with his character and you really find yourself hoping they can better their lives with this money and maybe move up to a double-wide trailer or something.Then comes ""Anton Chigurh"" played by Javier Bardem, who Llewelyn refers to as Sugar, the main antagonist in the movie, a psychopath after Llewelyn and the money. Wielding an oxygen-tank-air-gun-type thing that blows deadbolts and doorknobs off, and a shotgun equipped with a silencer he is easily my favorite character. And to answer Josh Brolin's question to Woody Harrelson in the movie, ""Who's this guy supposed to be, the ultimate badass?"" Yes. Yes he is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good,"No Country for Old Men (2007) is a gripping yet uneven thriller that earns a 7/10 for its impressive but slightly flawed execution. Javier Bardem's portrayal of Anton Chigurh is chilling and memorable, delivering a standout performance that anchors the film. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin also offer strong performances, though their characters could have been more fully developed. The cinematography is stark and atmospheric, effectively capturing the desolate landscape and heightening the film's tension. The story is compelling and intense but may feel slow-paced and ambiguous at times, leaving some viewers wanting more clarity. The minimalistic soundtrack complements the film's tone, adding to its unsettling atmosphere. Overall, it's a solid film with strong elements but falls short of being truly exceptional.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best of the year.,"A time when drug deals come with multiple murders and amoral operatives is no time for aging West Texas sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) to stay on the job, especially since Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) is determined to retrieve the dollars from amateur but crafty Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin).No Country for Old Men, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel by the Coen brothers, is a classic explanation of a title, where the plot is perfectly in synch with the titular expectations. In fact, this film is one of the best modern westerns ever and even at this late time of the year, closing in on Oscar, one of the best of the year.Because the Coens are notorious for ingeniously wringing out humor in dark films (Think the washed out Fargo, the pregnant cop, the Minnesota accents), no one will be disappointed at the laughs emerging from the clipped, minimalist speech of Texans who wouldn't acknowledge Mr. Death if he were handing them a calling card. For example, when Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) is asked how dangerous Anton is, he replies, ""Compared to what? The bubonic plague?""The Coens catch the slow, indifferent drawls and irritation at strangers who don't get it. But in most cases, Anton Chigurh is in no mood to indulge these rubes and disposes of them as one might shoo flies from a hot border cafe. (Sometimes he engages his victims in a simple existential conversation concerning fate and personal responsibility.)The pace is slow enough for Jones to do his best acting ever, with Brolin a stunning Nick Nolte imitation. But the slow, assured menace of Bardem dominates No Country, like the arid, deathly plains of New Mexico cinematographer Roger Deakins nails perfectly as metaphor. Add this modern Western to this year's excellent westerns 3:10 to Yuma and Assassination of Jesse James, and you have as satisfactory a genre year as ever since Unforgiven.Much will be made of the Hitchcockean pacing and inscrutable ending. Granted, but these facets are just a signal that the Coens are back borrowing and puzzling as never before with a film that stands proudly beside Arizona and Fargo.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Superb Adaptation of a Master Storyteller,"For years Cormac McCarthy has been a literary sensation. While never achieving the massive success of Stephen King or Tom Clancy when he first began writing novels in the mid 1960's (perhaps because he churns out so few- NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is only his 9th novel) he has been hailed as the literary successor to William Faulkner. I have read only two of his novels so far: the Appalachian Gothic horror novel OUTER DARK and his seminal masterpiece, the revisionist western BLOOD MERIDIAN. His novels sear into your very soul- they are not easily forgotten- and only the best writers can do that.If there are any common themes in all of McCarthy's novels, they all point to a message of social Darwinism. His books are regularly downbeat, representing a world full of violence and despair, peopled by the most evil of men and the intertwining of ordinary folks who try their best to live their lives despite the bleak, unrelenting landscape (McCarthy is the only author I know who makes the land feel like a living, breathing person, just like his characters) that surrounds them.NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is the second adaptation of his works (the first was the pedestrian and forgettable ALL THE PRETTY HORSES which starred Matt Damon) and this time directed by Joel and Ethan Coen, two brothers who have become fixtures in the cult scene (one of their other movies is MILLER'S CROSSING, my favorite gangster movie next to the GODFATHER). While many literary critics regard NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN as one of McCarthy's lesser works, even a lesser McCarthy novel is still light years ahead of most other books in terms of quality. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a purely straightforward thriller and in the hands of a lesser director (or in this case, directors) would have been just another movie that would have quietly gone on to the DVD rack (like Matt Damon's movie), but due to the fact that the Coens are great admirers of McCarthy's works, they were able to stay true to the spirit of the book and in a sense, made a masterpiece- this movie should be studied in film schools as to ""How To Make A Proper Book Adaptation To Film And Not Muck It Up 101"".The plot is exceedingly simple: set in the southwest circa 1980, redneck loser Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin in his best role ever) stumbles upon the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad. He decides to take the drug money, but in a moment of conscience, gets identified by both sides who want the money back. In comes the deadly killer Anton Chigurh (ironically pronounced ""sugar"" and is played to perfection by Xavier Bardem) who goes on an interstate rampage (one of his most inventive weapons is a compressed air canister) as he sets his sights on the fleeing Moss to get the money back, whatever the cost. Not since Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter has there been a superb and deadly villain to ever come on screen, Bardem can scare you just by looking at you, he doesn't even need to utter a word; and if he doesn't win the Oscar it will be a travesty. The cat and mouse game between Moss and Chigurh is further complicated by the investigations of a local sheriff portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones in his usual stoic attire who tries to make some sense amidst all of the mayhem (but ultimately fails). The movie starts haphazardly and ends abruptly, which is just like McCarthy's books (and just like real life)- if you are looking for a formulaic Hollywood movie with a clear beginning and ending then its best to watch a Disney, a Michael Bay movie or ALVIN AND THE CHIPMUNKS- this one's not for you.The Coen brothers perfectly captures the unrelenting harshness of Cormac McCarthy's world- a world in which the big fish eat the little fish and the bad sleep well at night- McCarthy may be a bit of a downer, but in my view he is right. In the last few years McCarthy has now finally gotten the attention he deserves, his newest novel THE ROAD won the Pulitzer prize and a movie adaptation of it is heading to the big screen soon- let us hope that they get it right just like this one and not make it end up like Matt Damon's movie. Now if only they would also make a faithful literary adaptation of BLOOD MERIDIAN- now that would indeed be a miracle",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Personification of 'Fate',"I won't talk too much about this great movie, given that other reviewers have covered most points, but lets just say that its' harshest critics simply missed the underlying story of the movie and these misguided critics were left lost and confused by the film's ending. On the other hand most people who were paying attention saw the genius behind the ending and also realised that Javier Bardem's character was, to put it mildly, the personification of 'fate'.

"Crime Story, Elegy, Modern Masterpiece","This noir-ish modern-day Western is the Coen at their pitch-perfect best - at least, the serious side of the Coen's best ... though there's still space here for some dark comedy. The performances are brilliant, but it's the long stretches without dialogue that stick the longest in the min; tension is stretched up to and way beyond what is usually considered comfortable, the silence around events perhaps the otherwise absent moral judgement on empty greed and violence. Bardem stands out, naturally; a largely silent presence who (though a very different type of character) builds up Lecter-like levels of evil dread as he goes about his terrible business. As much as it's an exquisitely tense crime story, it's also a mediation on what it's like to feel as if the world is leaving you behind; it's not what you once knew, and what's gone can't ever be recaptured now this new evil as blown into town, exposing much else in its wake.

Bardem's Country.,"No Country for Old Men (2007): Dir: Ethan Coen, Joel Coen / Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Kelly McDonald, Woody Harrelson: Another winner from directors Joel and Ethan Coen tackling the change in society. In this case a Sheriff played by Tommy Lee Jones questions the latest string of murders. Josh Brolin plays a hunter who stumbles upon a case full of cash and numerous bodies. His treasure leads to extreme consequences that will cost him. Javier Bardem plays an unusual killer, blasting door locks and asking bizarre questions often contained within a coin toss. Kelly McDonald plays Brolin's wife as fearful yet strong in the face of adversary, which renders a questionable and harsh finale. Woody Harrelson plays a cocky bounty hunter attempting to track down Bardem. The Coen brothers are notorious for bizarre plot ideas, having made such great films as Blood Simple and The Big Lebowski. Jones as the Sheriff transcends a sense of dread and hopelessness as he comes close but not close enough. However, Bardem steals the film as the memorable villain whose methods are odd. The ending can be seen as either symbolic or just a cop out solution in terms of Bardem's placement. It presents a strong view regarding violence and its everlasting presence and the corrupt nature of society. Title represents its strain on weary souls seeking refuge.

It's Javier Bardem Show!,"It is a One-Man show! Despite the star-studded ensemble; this is a Javier Bardem show through and through. His disturbingly accurate portraiture of a sociopathic person along with the script's ingrained ability to make good use of the tension brings forth a certain uneasiness, an atmosphere fraught with unsettling sentiments; every time Mr. Bardem is featured in the center of the frame, somehow the entire execution got energized, rejuvenated.I think it is something to do with Javier's pragmatic characterization of the role that I find (and I'm sure a lot of the others do too) amusing and eerily realistic. The way he walked, had conversations, engaged in the acts of fury and rage; Ah! It was terrific. No wonder he bagged an Academy Award for his portrayal, needless to say, he thoroughly earned that glory.As far as the film is concerned, I found it to be a decent neo-western thriller, that's it, nothing more nothing less. There are mainly two reasons for that conclusion; one, I despised the ending as I firmly believe that there were much better ways to wrap up this narrative, and two, aside from Bardem's Anton Chigurh, there were no other characters that irked my curiosity.I know some of you might be infuriated about my views and might have the urge to question my taste in films, well, for your information, I'm not someone who's so much into western flicks, I do watch them occasionally, especially whenever hear something good has come up. So do not say I have a lack of understanding regarding this genre I just don't dig it as much as some of you might do. If this film has worked for you, fine, I'm glad it did.

However, I found the editing a little over-indulgent, and beyond a certain point the film meandered more and more until it seemed to be unsure of what the subject was.If it had lost about 20 minutes and focused more on either one storyline or the other, I feel it would have made a more satisfying experience overall.

"""There are no clean getaways""","Violence and mayhem ensue after a hunter stumbles upon some dead bodies, a stash of heroin and more than $2 million in cash near the Rio Grande.I've never seen much of Ethen and Joel Cohen's work but this was a pretty good example of what they can do. No country for old men would sound like a pretty weird title for a movie like this, but there's an explanation by the end of the movie. I really enjoyed the cat-and-mouse chase between the two and the tension was pretty real (especially the almost no score and almost silent.) The villain in the movie got a bunch of awards for being the most intimidating next to Joker, which he is a pretty menacing, crazy guy. The whole drug war thing is very real and by the end of the movie, it feels like you have just ran because of the real tension. I'm also a fan of the fade-to-black endings where it has no real direction to it, but that in my case, it's near brilliant.

"The directing, acting and cinematography is outstanding, but that really is a gross understatement.","'No Country For Old Men' film review.Having spent a lot of my summer watching films from the top 250 list on IMDb, I finally made my way down to No Country For Old Men. A film I'd heard ravenously positive reviews for, when it was released in 2007 and one I had never got round to watching. And the first film that I concluded was well worth my time producing a review for. I chose to dive into this film without viewing the trailer, so I was totally oblivious as to what I would be exposed to. All I knew was the brief plot line; that there was 'a drug deal gone wrong.'No Country For Old Men directed by the Coen brothers and based on the critically acclaimed novel by Cormac McCarthy, began with stunning scenes of the Rio Grande overlaid with a strong opening voice-over by Tommy Lee Jones, who effortlessly plays an intelligent and compassionate police Sheriff. A Sheriff who subtly adds a voice of sanity and slight humour in a world where evil and corruption is at its peak. He stumbles upon a drug deal that had certainly 'gone wrong.' His callow young deputy remarks, plaintively: ""It's a mess, ain't it, Sheriff?"" And he replies, concisely: ""If it ain't, it'll do until the mess gets here."" Suggesting the overpowering, current criminal situation of western America.The second introduction is where we meet Javier Bardem, who plays Anton Chigur. Probably being the most ruthless and inhumane villain I have ever had the pleasure of watching. At first viewing, his appalling hairstyle and serious wit is completely overshadowed by his thirst for murder, using an air gun that is familiar in the cattle industry for killing livestock, where he mindlessly kills his victims just as if they too were cattle ready for slaughter. With multiple viewings, I was then able to fully appreciate his performance and embrace the moments when they were so cruel it was funny. Anton Chigur was a hit man who was given the job of retrieving the lost $2 million dollars from the botched drug deal. The very first scene in which we meet Anton and really see what he is capable of is where he mimics a police officer and orders an innocent man out of his car, which unsurprisingly sees the man to his death. A very striking scene that immediately indicated to me I was in for a roller-coaster of a ride.The next and final main character is Josh Brolin, who plays a cowboy-type called Llewellyn Moss. He carries the majority of the film with his powerhouse performance of a calculated and intelligent man in hot pursuit with the cash, right up until his inevitable death nearer the end. The grueling journey we see, with the utterly psychopathic Anton right on Llewellyn's heels is as tense as anything I'd seen before and the absolute definition of 'thrill ride.' To be genuinely terrified throughout a film has never happened to me before, but in many scenes I really was holding my breath because I had no idea what was going to happen next. The absence of music added to the ever growing suspense and the severe reality of this film.The tone of the film is evidently apocalyptic; I felt, at times, that the characters were in ghost towns and that they were completely on their own in this severely dangerous world. The battle between good and evil is intensified by the Sheriffs need for redemption. The seriousness mixed in with comical elements is recognisably Coen's work. But here they manage to heighten and deepen their identity as filmmakers with a film that I would only describe as perfect. The directing, acting and cinematography is outstanding, but that really is a gross understatement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Breathtaking Camera-work in No Country For Old Men,"""No Country For Old Men"" is a brilliant film, proved by its four well-deserved Academy Awards. Though the used camera techniques are not as spectacular or revolutionary as in other films such as ""The Matrix"", it is nonetheless an effective and vital part of the final product. From the discovering of the shoot-out and the money to the never-ending hunt across the deserts and streets of Texas, there are some great nuggets of camera-work, hidden for those who look for them. In this review we will categorize the scenes in three sections, and then analyze the camera techniques applied in that. These techniques are: Desert scenes, focusing on the setting and camera-work, then the use of special camera effects and realistic ones, and lastly; the camera-work in the urban scenes.As said; first up are the rural desert shots of Texas and New Mexico. The desert scenes are excellently done often filmed from knee or standard body height it gives the feeling you're right there in the idle of it. The perfect example of this is the stumbling of Moss on the Mexican drug deal shoot-out. Filmed from knee height, like many other scenes, it both gives the viewer the feeling he is there walking alongside Moss. In addition this perspective makes it more difficult for the viewer to have an overview of the current situation. By this the directors are creating more tension all along, as none know what happens next and what dangers Moss will face. By contrast the overview 'flying' shots let you see the vastness of the desert, how small and insignificant human settlement is there. This is mostly done when the characters are on their own, alone in the sand covered landscape. This view gives them a sense of loneliness and isolation. Other themes are also conveyed here, albeit less clearly. One example is that in these lone shots the characters seem both hunters and hunted, hunting alone and being watched from above.In this film there has not been made an extensive use of lenses and or filters. We have not spotted any special color effects. We have only noted one function for each of the techniques: wide-angle lenses for the overview scenes and filters to make certain scenes a little bit darker to add to the tension in that particular scene. But maybe this means that it's very well done. As often the case with backstage work: when you don't notice it is a job well done. Rather unique in ""No Country for Old Men"" is the absence of music throughout the film. For example when characters are walking through the desert the only sounds you hear are those by the boots in the sand. This also adds to the tension, especially in scenes at the place of the drug-battle, and it increases the viewers' focus. This feeling of really living in it is also partially created by the shots in which you look from the viewpoint of the character. For example when the camera is looking down at the hood of the car, r through the windshield, this makes you feel like you are behind the wheel.There a few chase scenes in urban environments in ""No Country For Old Men"". These environments include motel rooms and small houses. Because of the fact that these places are small the viewer is very close to the protagonist, mostly Moss, so there are lots of close-ups in these scenes. In these chases the viewer follows only one character, so they don't see what the other (Anton Chigurh) is doing. This has the same effect as the knee shots in the deserts; the lack of overview gets the viewer on the edge of their seat. The camera positions are extremely well executed and give an excellent atmosphere to the scenes. Another specific scene is during the night in a Southern Town. There are no people on the street and it almost feels like a horror movie. In the scenes in which the characters speak together in a house or some other type of building, you identify with the characters. These spots are also small spaced, so you feel like you are in the middle of the conversation, looking -like the camera- at the speakers from different angles. The shots in which all the characters are displayed are and the lighting are great throughout the film.We think ""No Country for Old Men"" with great camera-work and sound effects. The perspective adds very well to how the viewer observes the film. The award-winning directors Joel and Ethan Coen have once again shown where their status has come from. The film has justly received some high-praised awards including the Oscar for the best film and also many positive reviews from well-known newspapers and websites. We can not wait to see the next Coen brothers' film!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
West Texas has never looked more interesting.,"It is easy to dip into clichés when describing ""No Country for Old Men,"" to talk about the plot that feels as big as West Texas itself, and as someone who has driven through way too many times, it is a gigantic place.Those crutches are understandable, because the movie does feel as big as Texas. The big skies that are in the movie from the very first scene and continue to its close add a sort of inhumanity to the film's atmosphere. The intense yet well-done violence and the terror it produces feels as insignificant to the vistas of West Texas as the scattering of deer that Llewellyn tries to hunt near the beginning of the movie.""No Country"" manages to combine sublime beauty and rip-roaring fun.(I have seen this several times after Fall 2016, last on May 3, 2017.)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Violent but poetic,"The Coen brothers strike again, this time with Javier Bardem as a vicious psychopath named Anton who has been hired to recover stolen drug money.

A cat and mouse game ensues between Anton and Llewelyn with Sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones) also part of the ongoing storyline.Carson Wells(Woody Harrelson has also being paid to find the cash.

Fargo is still my favorite crime drama, but No Country is close second and the ending is unforgettable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The silence and the talking,"This movie does two contradicting things perfectly. It uses silence really well, and communicates a lot using other means that dialogue. Even in scenes with conversations, it feels like more is being communicated by what you see than what you hear. But at the same time, the dialogue is some of the best you'll see in film. The way people talk, both the accents and what they say, makes it feel like you're immersed in a really good novel (which the movie obviously is based on), while at the same time it feels real. Together, it makes for a movie that says a lot when it's not saying anything, and is stunning even when the characters are talking.It's also a movie that can take many re-watches. Partly because there are so many good moments, and it's visuals being so good. But also because it has an ending that might surprise you the first time around, but that you'll get a more understanding for when you know what's coming.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Wow what a movie,"I echo much of what is said here (at least in the positive reviews): scary, thrilling, very unconventional and unpredictable, great story, greater acting, a movie that stays with you. No formula to this one. And I was late to the show, I just saw it this week for the first time. Vietnam vet/welder Brolin is out hunting when he stumbles across the remains of a huge drug scuffle including $2 mil in cash. He brazenly runs with the money, unaware that assassin Chugirh has been tasked with recovering the funds. In the middle is Tommy Lee Jones, a tired sheriff trying to put the pieces together with a bunch of murders. There are at least six or seven characters in this that are so real and special. I have to say that I needed to see the movie more than once to understand what isn't shown, but it all makes sense in the end. Just spectacular, worthy of its awards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tough film -- great symbolism..,"The story: an uncompromising tale of greed, ruthlessness, and unstoppable foes, with a backdrop illustrating the changes the drug trade has ushered in.

In a weird way I think the movie was pretty perfect.,"I'll do my best to explain why I think the movie was 'perfect' without any spoilers.Given the nature of each person and their back story, (you can only get their back stories when they mention very quick and subtle details amidst the chaos) the actors play each role in a ridiculously amazing way. The characters you see and learn about act and react exactly as their character types would given their circumstances.This movie allows you to feel both anger and sympathy for every single person for almost any choice they make.The movie will play games with your head, and you won't even realize what has happened until the scene is long over.A movie I watched twice and then deleted the download.

A bit Confuse,"The Coen brothers did fine fine job on No Country for Old Men, I'm drawn back into 1980 in Texas. Throughout the movie from the start until very end it builds up the suspense so badly that you think well at end the everything will fall into pieces and yes after that its all going to be okay. But it turns out to very different direction at the end, so some may feel disappoint. Like me for example first I was very disappointed but when I think of it me it leaves audiences to know for more and for my opinions it leads to alternate endings according to individuals.So yes, I would recommend friends and others to watch it and interpret in their own ways, I might say even the plot is quite confusing but it doesn't over power the suspense and intelligently in this movie. The performance of every character is great as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An excellent film that bears all the Coen Brothers' hallmarks,"""No Country for Old Men"" is an excellent film. Written and directed by Ethan and Joel Coen, and based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy (which I haven't read), it is a stylish, bleak and brooding movie with undertones of a Western and of film noir and with an almost matchless evocation of time, mood, place and character. It is also surprisingly amusing in places.Set in Texas in 1980 (the date can be pinpointed by one scene in the film in which a coin minted in 1958 is described as being 22 years old), it tells the story of Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin). Moss, a young veteran of the Vietnam War, is a welder by trade. He and his wife Carla Jean (Kelly Macdonald) have little money and live in a modest house trailer. While out hunting one day, Moss encounters the detritus of a drugs scam that has evidently misfired. There are several dead bodies and a number of abandoned vehicles strewn around the scene, as well as a dead dog. One of the vehicles contains a huge consignment of drugs. The money deriving from the deal - $2 million - is also there, in a briefcase next to a dead man. Moss thinks quickly and decides to purloin the cash. Unfortunately for him, that money is being sought by Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Chigurh is a ruthless, vicious, evil man, with psychopathic tendencies. He will happily and perfunctorily decide whether to kill or to spare someone literally on the toss of a coin. Chigurh carries a canister of compressed air around with him. He uses it, amongst other things, to help to break into premises. He also has a stun gun, with which he kills anyone who attempts to thwart him. It emits a cylinder into his victim's head and thrusts it back afterwards. Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his assistant are the law enforcement representatives who attempt to prevent Chigurh's murderous stalking of Moss.""No Country for Old Men"" is essentially about the complex nature of evil, as personified by Chigurh. He is cold, ruthless and unfeeling but also displays some (admittedly weird) principles in his behaviour. In one scene late in the film, he needlessly goes after Carla Jean precisely because he thinks such action is a matter of principle. Moss had earlier refused to compromise with him and to hand over the money even though Chigurh had said that Moss's failure to do so would result in his having to assassinate Carla Jean. Chigurh therefore feels duty bound to carry out his threat.The cinematography, the screenplay and the direction are first rate, as is the acting. It would perhaps be invidious to single out any one particular member of the cast, given that everyone is so good. But, for me, Bardem is the star. His performance as Chigurh is astonishingly good. There is one distinctly memorable scene in which he confronts the owner of a gas (petrol) station in the middle of nowhere and chillingly plays mind games with him about whether he will kill him or not. That scene is brilliantly acted by Bardem (and by Gene Jones who plays the gas station owner).""No Country for Old Men"" is a classy, intelligent and entertaining film. It is a must-see. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Haircuts, Hitmen, and the Harsh Reality of Heads or Tails","""No Country for Old Men,"" brought to us by the Coen brothers, is the kind of film that sucker-punches you in the gut but in the politest way possible. It's like receiving an ""I'm sorry I ruined your life"" card from a hitman - you're not sure whether to be terrified or thankful for the gesture. The movie, set in the bone-dry deserts of West Texas, turns a simple drug deal gone wrong into a masterclass of suspense and existential dread, seasoned with a generous dash of good ol' fashioned violence.Javier Bardem's portrayal of Anton Chigurh, with that nightmarish bowl haircut, could single-handedly revive the silent but deadly type villain. His performance is so chilling, it'll make you double-check your locks and invest in a metal detector. Josh Brolin, as our everyman Llewelyn Moss, is just a guy trying to make a quick buck without getting killed - a plan that goes about as well as you'd expect in a Coen brothers' flick. Then there's Tommy Lee Jones, playing the world-weary Sheriff Bell, who delivers homespun wisdom as if he's trying to convince himself that the world still makes sense.Dropping half a star because let's face it, the ending leaves you hanging harder than a cliffhanger on a soap opera. It's like the Coens decided to say, ""We think you've had enough,"" and shut the book while you're still turning the page. But despite the abrupt goodbye, ""No Country for Old Men"" remains a near-perfect blend of thriller and philosophical musing, offering both adrenaline and insights in spades. 4.5 stars for this impeccably crafted ode to the merciless march of fate and bad haircuts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Meandering and somewhat derivative, but still interesting","The first half of 'No Country for Old Men' comes off something like 'The Terminator goes to West Texas'. All the elements are there: an unstoppable, determined, and soulless killing machine set against a hopelessly outmatched protagonist who is simply trying to stay alive another day. Derivativeness aside, this part of the movie is still quite gripping, though, which is more than I can say for the second half of the film. As things dragged on, I couldn't help feeling a little bored as Tommy Lee Jones' pseudo-philosophical and somewhat redundant sheriff increasingly wandered in and out of the story. Near the end of the movie, the story seems completely lost. The abrupt ending especially feels like the filmmakers ran out of gas and tried to pass it off as authenticness and artistry. It's too bad, because this movie could have easily been a 9 or a 10 based on the first hour or so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Half-Baked,"From their very first film, the marvelous ""Blood Simple,"" the Coen brothers have displayed a terrific visual style. This film is no exception, featuring some beautiful scenes as well as as some well-executed action. Unfortunately it's all style, no substance. It starts off well but is undone by a very unsatisfying denouement. Too much time is spent on Jones' opaque and uninteresting monologues. The plot is confusing and full of holes, with irrelevant characters wandering in and out who are not even introduced to the audience. It seems as if the Coens lost interest at some point and decided to release the film unfinished and rough around the edges. Quite disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Modern Western with a edge of the seat suspense,"This film had a great impact on me.The desert, the people who inhabit and the start with the metaphoric wild animals and the hunter sets the pace for the ensuing drama graphically told. Every moment is breathtaking and makes you participate in the proceedings. The screenplay unfolds a wide canvas for a wild journey for the good, bad and ugly men.sometimes one feels why human beings behave in such despicable fashion without reason or remorse for their fellow beings. Riveting performances of each actor brings the true element of 'make believe' aided by excellent cinematography,editing and direction. In recent times no other film affected me so much as this one.

The Cohen Brothers Strike Gold with another Winner...,"Joel and Ethan Cohen brought home the Academy Award for Best Picture of 2007 with NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, a dark and chilling suspense thriller which takes the classic cat and mouse chase genre to an entirely new level. The film stars Josh Brolin, in his finest performance to date, as a schnook who happens upon the remains of a brutal crime scene, where he finds several dead bodies, a huge shipment of heroine, and a case containing two million dollars and the consequences of his fatalistic decision to take off with the money, prompting his being hunted by a cold-blooded assassin (Jarvier Bardem), who will stop at nothing to get his money back. Throw in a laid back Texan sheriff (played to perfection by Tommy Lee Jones)assigned to the case and you have all the ingredients of a first class thriller. This gritty and uncompromising drama pulls no punches and offers no easy solutions to a myriad of questions it raises, most notably, ""Did this guy really think he could get away with stealing two million dollars?"" The film is dark and atmospheric, creating such a height of suspense that there is virtually no music score and you really don't miss it. The suspense created by the story propels the film itself. Jarvier Bardem won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his bone-chilling performance as Chagur, the deadly and apparently conscience-free killer chasing Brolin. Bardem creates one of the most terrifying cinematic villains ever, whose brutality is only surpassed by his unpredictability. The Cohens have crafted an intricate story that does peter out toward the end, but for the majority of its running time, will have you literally holding your breath. Not quite up the standards of their classic FARGO, the film is still practically a classic that improves upon repeat viewings and reinforces Joel and Ethan Cohen as filmmakers to be reckoned with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The second half, man was it disappointing, a big event takes place that really wasn't focused on very much and then the movie is an absolute mess. Tommy Lee Jones is dreadful in this role, he is so extremely boring and I have no idea why he is projected as the main character as he adds absolutely nothing to the plot. I've also seen that people that the ending was spectacular. It's so abrupt and absurdly slow at the same time and has no real effect left for me as a viewer, not only that but it is so unsatisfactory and left me feeling dead inside.

Dark Masterpiece,"Joel and Ethan Coen have made something of a dark masterpiece in this movie, shot in the American southwest with desert landscapes and one-on-one encounters that are grim, chilling and sometimes strangely amusing. The time is 1978 and two of the characters are Vietnam veterans. The acting is outstanding, particularly Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones. Woody Harrelson is a droll and cynical investigator in a supporting role. The directors use pauses, muted soundtracks, silent gunshots and chase scenes, often shot in darkness inside and out. Tommy Lee Jones, the sheriff, is the most stable character and the man most aware of his own faults and the evils he sees in the world. Times are changing with crime more widespread and he takes solace in the past. Kelly MacDonald is outstanding as the wife of Josh Brolin.

Horrible psychopath killer wandering in beautiful West Texas,"In the desert in West Texas in 1980, a local man Moss happens to find an aftermath of a shootout site after a drug deal went wrong. He finds a bag of two million dollars and takes it. After that, he begins to be chased by Chigurh, an assassin who is hired to retrieve the money.Chigurh is a horrible psychopath. He has a sturdy body, unwavering eyes and a creepy mop-top haircut. He kills people without the slightest wince whenever he needs to do so. (And he was chosen as the most realistic psychopath in cinema in a study conducted by psychiatrists.)The landscape of arid West Texas is very beautiful. Characters walk around the vast land with their quiet footsteps and the sound of the wind. I'll never forget the breathtaking getaway scene in the dawn sunlight.The indoor scenes are also excellent, especially the use of lights. For example, in a motel room, car headlights come into the room and the cast a character's shadow on the wall, which makes the scene really suspenseful.The chief investigator in the film is the sheriff Bell. He is tired of the endless violence, which his family has been in charge of fighting for generations. Question is, the violence is perpetual, or can be gotten rid of? I think it is represented by Chigurh. Chigurh is a kind of determinist, who thinks even his own murder is caused by fate. If it is fate, it would not be changed. But his determinism is challenged later in the film, where I think we see the hope to change.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Well, okay. What do we circulate? Lookin' for a man who recently drunk milk?","Texas is a perfect setting for a movie like this -- no trees, just desolate land for miles around. The chicken farmer (Richard Jackson) was from Alpine -a place in the middle of nowhere with a long long stretch of road that literally - I kid you not - has turkey buzzards on the fence posts along the way. Annie Proulx (Brokeback Mountain) described it perfectly in her 2002 book, ""That Old Ace in the Hole."" I've been gone from there for five years, but it hadn't changed much from the 1980 setting in the film, an I suspect it hasn't changed much more.Llewelyn Moss, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin (Grindhouse, Hollow Man) thought he hit the jackpot. But, he didn't account for Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). Chigurh was methodical, intelligent and psychotic. He is the human equivalent of the terminator robot after John Conner. Those who believe in souls would not say that Chigurg has one.Tommy Lee Jones (The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, U.S. Marshals) is a tired sheriff that comes from a long line of lawmen.

""" What  are you looking for? Something in the Dark.  No one ever sees that ""","The Western is always in flux and with it the times.

Sheriff Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) and his deputy arrive at the drug massacre and try and piece the murders together and discover so many people are killed the whole crime makes little sense.

Don't eat popcorn while watching this movie because it's too awesome,"The worst movie to see while eating popcorn: No Country for Old Men (Coen brothers, 2007). The reason is simple: you hear no music for the two hours that it lasts. This film is made that you should appreciate every single noise you hear in it. Starting truck, shots, wind sounds, door squeaking, etc. So I pity the people who saw this movie in a movie theater, a place that tends to irritate attentive moviegoers due to people sitting in the first row who whisper to the person sitting next, or the guy all alone in the back who plunges his hand into his bag of chips. But it is precisely on this aspect that the film shines: its absence of music, and therefore on what remains of what human hearing can perceive by viewing the film; the sound. The film is absent of music, but it is just as if there was one. One can listen to the single musical piece during the end credits, but the dialogues are so powerful that the film does not need to clutter with music. Sometimes long scenes take place without a note of music or even dialogues, but it is precisely this silence that makes the film so captivating. The trio of actors represented on the cover (Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones) is perfect. Although the character of the sheriff, embodied by Tommy Lee Jones, experienced actor, seemed a bit more shadowed than the others, although he plays a key role in the plot. One wonders why the face of Woody Harrelson is not on the poster of the film. The impeccable Bardem's acting (recipient of the Oscar of the best actor) is of a prodigious originality. Each of the quotes of the character he incarnates (Anton Chigurh) is absolutely awesome. What to say about the scene where he shoots heads or tails with the cashier of the convenience store. It feels like he will shoot him in the head every moment, but he prefers to argue with the old man while eating peanuts. Finally, what to say about the photo montage, if not that every shot is framed to perfection and that a monk's patience had to be necessary to turn in these magnificent external decorations. Visually, this film is a work of art that surpasses any other low-range action thriller, despite an intrigue that would tend to qualify as ""typical"" cat and mouse play, which we have already seen a thousand times in Hollywood cinema. But it is the production of the Coen brothers that ranks No Country... above all the others. The film won the Oscar for the best film and deserves it, because it's too perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Short but sweet. My experience (No Spoilers),"First thing - I am not a reviewer. I do frequently watch movies but this is my first go of a review.I went into this movie not expecting much, I thought it would be just another one of those shoot em' ups with action, loads of blood and people dying ridiculous deaths... But I was really, really surprised and quite content with what I got out of this.The first time I watched this was very late at night and I just thought I would check out this movie everyone was talking about before bed. Next thing I know it's the early hours of the morning and I had just been taken on a journey that very few movies have done for me before.A few days later and this movie was all I could think about. The story is one of those that will stick in your mind even well after the credits roll.With the impact this movie made on me I would be lying to myself if I didn't call it one of my favourites.10/10 Thank you for reading.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good Coen Bros film - But far from their best.,"I'm going to go against the grain here. Everyone's gushing about No Country for Old Men. A new or mediocre director would've earned high praise from me. The problem with this movie is, it was made by a couple guys who've been behind some of the most creative movies and characters American cinema has produced in the last...well, period.By many metrics No Country for Old Men is very strong. Suspense, tension, cinematography, editing, lighting, and so on. Acting? Well yeah, it's strong -- starting of course with excellent actors. And the Coen Brothers are great at eking wonderful performances out of actors and creating amazing little moments with quirky regional characters. Fargo, Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, et al. rate among my favorite movies.But the characters in this movie didn't particularly develop or evolve. They seemed pat, and ended as they started. It's true, the twisted, truncated ending was refreshing of sorts (no ribbon bows here). But besides that, and death by captive bolt gun, I felt I'd seen nothing new. Nor is the viewer challenged to figure anything out. The story is actually pretty thin. Competent? Yes. Inspired? Sadly, no. The C Bros have raised the bar so much in the past, I should let them get away with making a solid, basic thriller. But people are raving about the genius of this movie and I sure didn't see it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Silent Echoes in a Ruthless Landscape,"""No Country for Old Men,"" directed by the Coen Brothers, is a film that delves deep into the heart of moral ambiguity and the relentless nature of fate. It starts with a simple yet gripping narrative structure that follows Llewelyn Moss, played by Josh Brolin, as he stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and a case full of money. This discovery sets off a chain of events that brings Anton Chigurh, a chillingly methodical hitman portrayed by Javier Bardem, onto his trail.The film's thematic depth is profound, exploring themes such as the randomness of violence and the inevitability of fate. It eschews traditional Hollywood tropes, offering instead a storyline that feels both unpredictable and brutally realistic. The Coen Brothers masterfully weave a tale that is as much a suspenseful thriller as it is a philosophical musing on the nature of evil and choice.Technically, the film is a marvel. The cinematography by Roger Deakins paints the Texas landscape as a character in itself - vast, beautiful, and indifferent. The lack of a conventional musical score adds to the film's tense atmosphere, allowing the natural sounds and silences to amplify the sense of unease and suspense.As the narrative unfolds, the film introduces Sheriff Bell, played by Tommy Lee Jones, whose reflections on the changing nature of evil and his place in the world provide a poignant counterpoint to the violence unfolding. His journey, though more subdued, is as compelling as Moss's game of cat and mouse with Chigurh.The performances are exceptional. Bardem's portrayal of Chigurh is both terrifying and mesmerizing, a force of nature whose presence looms over every scene. Brolin's Moss is a study in desperation and determination, while Jones's Sheriff Bell is a reminder of a world struggling to come to terms with a new kind of immorality.In conclusion, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a cinematic masterpiece that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's a film that doesn't just tell a story; it invites you to ponder the larger questions of life, destiny, and morality. The Coen Brothers have created a film that is both a gripping thriller and a profound piece of art, deserving of its critical acclaim and the accolades it has received.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Country for Old Men (2007) **1/2,"I kept meaning to see this when it was in the theaters because I'd heard so many great things about it. When it was praised at the Academy Awards and even got a Best Picture Oscar, I tried a little harder, but bad scheduling kept interfering. Now that I've seen it (not once, but twice -- more on that later) I've come to think the man upstairs might have been trying to spare me several dollars. First off, with such expectations going in, this will have to rank as one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen. My **1/2 rating wouldn't have changed a bit had I never heard of its reputation; it's just that I wouldn't have used the term ""overrated"" to describe it.The Bad: I'll skip with the storyline here, but just say that there are some plot holes and bits of business that just never made much sense to me (like having the suitcase transferred through the vents in the different hotel rooms). None of its characters are likable (not that this in itself is a deal breaker if a movie works), the pacing is lethargic and sleep-inducing, and the ending is terrible and inconclusive. Tommy Lee Jones is interesting as an ineffective Texas sheriff who can't deal with the escalating new brand of random violence, yet he's underused. All he does is offer up endless musings about how things have changed, but one wonders why they'd give a badge to such a disinterested lawman. And not only is Jones not interested; does anyone else in this state ever hear or react to all the endless shootings, car explosions and crashes going on everywhere?The Good: nice direction and cinematography, and good performances from Jones, Josh Brolin, and -- of course -- Javier Bardem, who makes one of the screen's most memorable villains with his ominous portrayal of a crazed and indifferent psychopathic killer. That said, do I think Bardem's performance was worthy of the coveted Oscar which he received? No, I wouldn't go quite that far. But as of this time I haven't seen the other best supporting actors' work in the other films they were nominated for along with Bardem.In the end this is just an Above Average chase movie with elements of western, horror, slash-and-stalk, and melodrama. It's well-acted, shot nicely, benefits from not using any music score. But I'm not sure of the point to any of the ugliness that's going on, and some things were incomprehensible, including the unsatisfying conclusion. I actually made sure to watch it two times... first last night where its pacing made my head nod a few times... and then again bright-eyed and bushy-tailed the next morning, just to make sure I gave it a fair chance. My rating stayed the same both times. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Will the Coens ever fail?,"Moss (Brolin) finds $2 million at a crime scene and takes off, sending his wife away, unaware that a man is following his every move.Whether it's the Dude Lebowski or dim trainer Chad, the Coens seem to create memorable characters and stories with apparent ease, whatever genre they tackle.This adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel tells almost a silent tale of a man running away with a heap load of cash from an unbelievable loony with a bizarre weapon. The slowest of openings the Coens have ever created again surprises and the lack of dialogue is more of a tale in the grand scheme of the picture. The sweeping shots of the west are vintage Coens and once again, die hard fans of the brother's will be surprised by their artistic direction and significantly their depiction of crime story telling.Javier Bardem's stalker is a cruel and articulate approach to a psycho, if you can call his character that. His Oscar winning turn as Chigurh is memorably haunting. He has the look, and the cold hearted attitude towards life is exceptionally freaky. Though the coin tossing element is too much Two Face, the darkness behind his character feels strongly realistic and is the stand out protagonist of the film.The narrative is consistent. Having never read the book I feel compelled to do so after being engrossed into a silent but underlining quick story that is always sharp and consistently intriguing on a number of levels. Though consistent I was completely lost come the ending but no doubt re-watching the film will be a joy and there is something to work out come the climax.There are twists and turns all the way from start to finish and what I personally like about the Coens is their courage. They are never afraid to hold anything back and write whatever they want, which usually makes their films unconventional, exciting and diverse, an important element in today's modern trend of ordinary releases. This is different from any conventional taking off with money and finding it kind of film.Perhaps not as interesting and sharp as the Big Lebowski or Burn after Reading, No Country still has that element to shock and surprise.No Country for Old Men is a silent crime western that will engross anyone with its sharp but silent story that is both shocking and entertaining.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not Your Traditional Western,"This is a movie that slews from one violent action to another in a seemingly over assertive pursuit by the film's protagonist.

"The film is outstanding, unfortunately in parts","No Country for Old Men is what I call a film with great potential. The potential of being a masterpiece, potential of reaching same heights of ""Fargo"" or ""Blood Simple"". But by the third and final act, the film loses its narrative arc and it resolves into just a good film.The first, second and third acts of the films are truly gripping - genuinely thrilling. Every muscle on the faces of all the actors moves exactly the way it should, following the directors' vision; the actors' enunciation is 100% perfect, and the dialogs, frequently minimalistic, are flawless. But by the last act, the graph drastically falls, characters don't get their proper send off and the film basically ends without any conclusion.The film is fueled with damn good performance by Javier Bardem, stunning photography by Roger Deakins and some great sound design which compensated for music score. Bardem is eerie, creepy and down-right chilling as Anton Chirugh, a ruthless psychopathic serial killer. His stone cold expressions are imported straight from hell. Bardem's Chirugh is one of the best on screen villainy I have seen. Josh Brolin is decent enough, Tommy Lee Jones is just there. Bardem outshines each and every cast member and steels the film.Roger Deakins' (who unfortunately again didn't won Oscar) work is marvelous. The bleak, deserted region of South Texas is wonderfully framed and composed. Deakins played with shadow and light so well in jaw dropping sequence of Motel confrontation, that alone deserved an Oscar.The film could have been so much more - only if the screenwriters/directors Coen Brothers could've made the ending of the film a little bit more cohesive. The biggest folly made by the directors was the off-screen death of Moss. In the end, the whole film resolved into nothing and you are left disappointed.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Another masterpiece by the Coen brothers.,Every time the Coen brothers come out with a movie I am blown away. This one is a little more Hollywood and mainstream but it still has the very solid writing and direction skill of the Coens.

As he approachers the vehicles he notices there is dead bodies in them. He searches around the vehciles and finds a big bag full of money along with a bunch of guns. He takes the money and the guns and hides them little to his knowledge a hit-man is already on his way to retrieve the money back from the man.This movie is another great film by the Coens I don't think they will ever fail.

Great ingredients so so Movie.,"I.admire Cormack McCarthy's work. I thought his novel ""Blood Meridian"" was a masterpiece. I like the Coen Brothers also. I read the novel before I saw the movie. I liked 90% of the way through and then didn't. I felt the same way about the film.The film's direction admirably reflects McCarthy's prose description of the Southwest. The script is taut, the plot moves, the acting is excellent.So what went wrong? In my opinion the ending was a copout. McCarthy has become obsessed with the power of evil. He overstates the the Bardem character, The Coens follow him down the line. The only time they change the original plot is to make Bardem's character even more omnipotent. A staged unhappy ending can be just as hokey as the typical cliched old time syrupy one. In this case the original author, and directors simply avoided an actual confrontation that one way or another would have lent some moral clarity to the story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Very overrated.,"To refer to this film as an 'instant classic' is highly disrespectful to those films which genuinely deserve such an accolade. Indeed, with the plethora of awards this film received I was expecting something 'shawshank' so to speak. This was a decent film that certainly had its moments, was well acted and directed- yet the fundamental story was insufficient to manifest the inference of 'greatness'. I believe it would be advisable to go and watch this film with lowered expectations, I fear it has been hyped up by certain critics who aim to see genius in something that is simply something adequate for their own delusions of critical expertise.

In retrospect this is truly a great film...,"When this first came out I wasn't all that impressed with the film. It seemed at the time to be just a exceptionally well crafted crime film that centered on a gripping cat-and-mouse chase. That's still true. The film is taunt and the tension is palatable. I think the reason that I didn't really connect with the first time is the Coen Brothers' humor is rather subdued in this film. The tale is darkly funny in places but it isn't laugh out loud the way, say, Fargo is. This isn't a complaint per se but the film feels a little atypical for the Coens.That is not to say it isn't exceptionally well directed. The Brothers' beautiful and mathematical compositions are all over this film. Likewise, the film use of shadow is very reminiscent of their noir-ish films, ala The Man Who Wasn't There. Likewise, the script's reworking of the western conventions has a lot in common with how they like to turn genres inside out.The best part of the film is easily Chigurh. There is dullness mixed with utter malice in his characterization. Bardem gives one of the most unnerving turns as this man of warped morality, the self-appointed hand of fate. The haircut is utterly terrifying in context.I am so glad I gave this another look. It is a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

My review,"In the Coen brothers' beautifully terse and achingly intense No Country For Old Men, we learn very early on that a drug deal has gone wrong on the eerily flat plains of southern Texas, leaving no surivors and only a briefcase full of money. Through the stolid eyes of Josh Brolin, who delivers an effortless performance as the overconfindent Llewelyn Moss, we see the aftermath of this carnage and we also see a desperate man with a mountain of debt snatch something he does not fully comprehend, as much as he likes to pretend he does. Tightly raut scenes of almost morbid silence such as this one fascinate almost as much as Javier Bardem's nightmare-inducing turn as psychopathic hit-man Anton Chigurgh, who is sent to retrieve the drug money by any means necessary, but all he needs is his trusty cattlegun friend-o. Any lesser movie would seemingly desolve into cat and mouse territory here with shoot outs and standoffs galore, but nothing is ever quite what it seems in this bleak but mesmerizing country, as Tommy Lee Jones shows up as a soon to be retired sheriff, and commands the screen by pumping the drama with morality and reality, not just lead.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This Country is Rough,"Brothers Joel & Ethan Coen, the acclaimed filmmakers that brought us Fargo over ten years ago brings their most vicious film to date, No Country for Old Men. As the film evokes all the Coen brothers artistic qualities as their attention to detail and character study, the narrative disenchants the viewer on many levels.The performances hold the viewers attention, especially during the final forty minutes or so. Many questions are left unanswered and many issues left not addressed. Javier Bardem as the ferociously frightening Anton gives his most stunning performance of his career. As the psychopathic killer looking for his $2 million case, Bardem not shutters, loses focus, or disengages himself from us. As crazy and psychotic as Anton is, there is a hero in him that the audience just loves to hate. A great character study for the Coen brothers indeed.Josh Brolin as the eager and reserved Llewelyn Moss brings frustration to the viewer based on narrative choices but Brolin powers through and gives his tantalizing turn yet. He does capture the culture of South Texas and develops it into a full on human being. The sentiment we find in Llewelyn is in his relationship with his wife Carla, a beautiful naïve woman, blindly in love with her husband with some many agendas.Kelly MacDonald as the beautiful Carla brings a resemblance of Amy Adams in Junebug, and we know how that worked out for her. This dramatic turn as minimal as the screen time is makes a lasting impression on everyone. When you walk out the theater it's her and Bardem that you take with you. That naïve persona, ""twangy"" accent, (we forget that she's Scottish) and that wonderful aura of curiosity and worried factors make it authentic to life.Tommy Lee Jones as the authoritative Sheriff Ed does an admirable job in his performance however, the first half of the film is the Bardem show which Jones can't overshadow at all. In the finale, the viewer is so frustrated by the story that I don't care that Jones is now bringing the humanity to his performance. The film was lively and authentic for me for the first hour and a half, after that, I started looking at my watch wondering when it was going to end. It does disappoint me that Jones' best work was placed in the weakest narrative points of the film. As people may feel different with that end, my intellect left the building at a point of aggravated feeling towards the things left unanswered. It was as if the Coen brothers started the film on pg. 34 of the novel and left out Chapters 12 and 14 to give us the full story.Consequently the film does work and has great achievements in cinematography and dialogue and is a threat in the upcoming awards race especially for Javier Bardem and Kelly MacDonald however, I can't foresee the Academy jumping on this for a Best Picture statue. This is so unlike Coens' brothers previous works but the detail and storytelling is pure Coen. A admirable turn for them despite the flaws.Grade: ***/****",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the Finest Movies of All Time...On Multiple Levels,"No Country For Old Men is by far the best movie the Coen Brothers have ever made. In fact I'd go so far as to say it's one of the best movies ever made. It works on so many levels, from the superficial angle of a modern Western oozing with tension, down to the subatomic level of the existentialism that it inflicts. It's enough to make you question everything you thought you knew about life, dispelling the myth of karma and pointing out how unfair life can be - and not in the way of ""that's not fair!"", but from the chaotic nature of fate. The universe doesn't care whether you're a good person or not. Things just happen without rhyme or reason. We all have our own choices to make, and there's no such thing as the right choice. Llewelyn goes back to give water to the dying man and it sets him down the path that led to his death by a party he wasn't even anticipating. There's nothing to fault in this movie. Even if you were let down by the anti-climatic ending, I urge you to go back and realise the anti-climax of it all was the point of the whole film. There's no grand showdown between the good guys and bad guys. Things just happen, for better or for worse.

No Country for Old Men is a cinematic masterpiece and one of the Coen Brothers best films - My Ultimate Review,"No Country for Old Men follows three main characters: Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a Vietnam War veteran and welder who stumbles upon a large sum of money in the desert; Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a mysterious hitman who is tasked with recovering the money; and Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), a local sheriff investigating the crime. The film also stars Kelly Macdonald as Moss's wife Carla Jean, and Woody Harrelson as a bounty hunter seeking Moss and the return of the $2 million. No Country for Old Men has the themes of fate, conscience and circumstance. Themes that the Coen Brothers have included in previous films.It was a couple of years ago since I watched this film and was amazed by the story and direction by the Coen Brothers, but most likely the characters and actors playing them. A little bit more than seven years later, I read the book it's based on and found it brilliant like its film adaptation. Something I never thought about back then is how visually stunning the film is, with so many scenes being shot so fantastically and impressive, the cinematography is brilliant. Now I'm rewatching No Country for Old Men and notice how close to the book it is, it's also a film that many critics included on their 2007 top ten lists than any other film and many regard it as the Coen brothers' best film. As of December 2021, various sources had recognized it as one of the best films of its decade, and as one of the best films of the 21st century. I agree fully with this being the Coen Brothers best film. No Country for Old Men was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won four, including Best Picture. Additionally, Javier Bardem won Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role; the Coen brothers won Achievement in Directing (Best Director) and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film is a very close adaptation and you see how Ethan and Joel Coen truly care about the author and the book they're adapting, they keep coming back and keep making McCarthy's books into superb films. It's also one of their most violent films, with brutal deaths that could easily be seen as controversial. But the Coen brothers and McCarthy are not interested in violence for its own sake, but for what it says about the world we live in.Numerous critics cited the importance of chance to both the novel and the film, focusing on Chigurh's fate-deciding coin flipping, but noted that the nature of the film medium made it difficult to include the ""self-reflective qualities of McCarthy's novel."" But that's completely all right in my opinion, it makes you want to read the novel. Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem) could easily be seen as one of the best villains in film and literature. There's so many things that make him iconic, but all the characters are memorable in their own way, mostly because of how flawed they are. I love stories with flawed characters as it makes them more relatable, but in No Country for Old Men, they are written that way for a reason and many critics have analyzed the three perspective characters and the various of themes the movie/book has to offer.Other than Javier Bardem's strong performance as the antagonist, earning him rightfully an Oscar, there's lots of more performances to behold. At first sight I think it would be easy to overlook Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones' performances. There isn't anything super special to them, comparing to Bardem's memorable performance. But the two actors do the characters and source material justice, and overall give great performances.What makes No Country for Old Men so different and so special, partly by how it's a mix of genres. How it can easily be seen as Crime, western, noir, horror and comedy. But to simplify the genre, let's call it a neo-western with noir. With No Country for Old Men, the Coens combine these two genres into one movie. It is a western with a tragic, existential, film noir ending. It can also easily be seen and enjoyed if you like thriller with plenty of suspension, as this film keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times.In terms of storytelling, the visual and in writing, The Coen Brothers created a cinematic masterpiece. No Country for Old Men has brilliant direction, editing, performances and cinematography. Even giving us an unforgettable ending.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
conundrum...or just dumb?,"What ruins this movie is that it is so over-rated.The movie contains elements of Sergio Leone's style, and another great director of westerns, Budd Boetticher (both Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones speak like Randolph Scott). However. Leone's and Boetticher's movies are satisfying.The Coens must have wondered: by deleting certain scenes, can we attain mystery, suspense... depth? I think that they succeeded --for some viewers-- because the movie did win best picture Oscar.I would rather see a movie that is very good than one that pretends to be great.I give it 6 stars mostly for Javier Bardem.

Brilliant violence,"Almost everyone but my wife has seen this movie. I love Josh Brolin in this - he projects an air of invincibility - but, of course is overcome by the ultimate bad ass - Anton. The weapons choice is great - using the bolt gun shows that Anton has no more respect for the poor souls he dispatches than he would for a helpless animal. Anton's sense of morals (amorals) is chilling - ""I promised your husband that I would kill you."" (So naturally I cannot go back on my word.)and""You don't have to do this!"" - the words of the desperate about to be victim before every psychopathic killer who is about to do them in. Of course they have to do it - that's what makes them psychopaths. And Anton says ""They all say that."" He's right & it never convinces the killer to do otherwise. I'd like to see one where the killer said ""You know? You are right - go ahead & leave."" Now that would be a surprise.Needless to say, I loved the movie (Probably 2nd or 3rd time I have seen it.) The Coen Brothers are great - very quirky - amazing. I am surprised that ""No Country"" won as many Academy Awards as it did - it does not espouse the usual far left liberal bull, nor does it glorify the gay life style - those are the prevailing themes in the movies that Hollywood loves.Finally Tommy Lee Jones is at his best in the role of the Sheriff. Many funny irreverent lines - makes a little fun of his deputy. One of his best roles.If you are OK with the violence, this is a must see. DonB",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I wish it would had been though, since that probably would had meant that I would had liked and enjoyed the movie much better.My main problem I had with this movie was that the story and foremost its storytelling got unnecessarily complicated at times. The movie has all the right ingredients in it to make a good and typical Coen brother's movie with but some of the ingredients are not present good enough and not mixed in well enough with all of the other ingredients. It doesn't make ""No Country for Old Men"" as tasty as I would had hoped and also expected. After all, this movie was the big winner of the 2008 80th Annual Academy Awards, where it won Oscar's for best movie and directing.It mainly lacks some witty and subtle comedy. Yes, ""No Country for Old Men"" does obviously still feature this all but the movie just gives you the feeling if it all had been a tad bit more comical and not as serious, the movie would had been a way better one.It's still a superior shot and made movie though from the obvious talented Coen Brothers. It foremost also really shows how acting can really make a movie. Coen brother movie characters are of course always something unusual and unforgettable and ""No Country for Old Men"" also truly features some unforgettable and unusual characters in it.Of course most memorable is Javier Bardem as a serial killer with some odd weapons as choice. He deserved his Oscar. He plays his character chilling, as well as with a sense of comedy, despite the fact that his character doesn't ever show some emotion. A real great achievement from Spanish born actor Javier Bardem. But the entire movie is basically well cast with some big names such as Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson in it, as well as some unexpected choices, such as Josh Brolin and Kelly Macdonald in some roles I had never ever seen them in before but they fit and play their roles surprisingly well.The movie is slowly build up with some long shots. It makes ""No Country for Old Men"" also a real beautiful movie to watch, also not in the least of course thanks to Roger Deakins Oscar nominated camera-work.I would say; beware not to expect another ""Fargo"" and you'll probably end up liking this movie but if it had been a bit more entertaining all it really truly would had been one of the movies of the year.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coen Brothers' Triumph!,"No Country For Old Men is based on Cormac McCarthy's 2005 novel of the same name: and having read the novel I can honestly say that the Coen Bros. did a fantastic job adapting the book for the screen. It's ridiculously faithful to the source material and it's visualized in such a gorgeously cinematic way that it's no wonder this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2008 (for the films of 2007). It's a neo-Western, neo-noir thriller that is virtually an extravagant showcase for Javier Bardem's terrifying villain Anton Chigurh (which won Bardem the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor). Bardem's so intimidating as Chigurh that I'd say he's almost as scary as Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter (even though this film isn't a horror-piece).No Country for Old Men is a masterpiece of 2000s-cinema and rightly so: it's a multi-genre piece that has the same brutal desolation of a classic Western, the tense direction of action-thrillers from directors like Martin Scorsese or Michael Mann, but it has the grounded approach to Western filmmaking of John Ford and Sergio Leone. This film is entertaining yet relentlessly tense in its drama, satisfying yet bittersweet in its many payoffs, and never dull in its 2-hour run-time.If you want a Western that's got the conventions of the oldie-goodies yet updates it for more modern times (1980 in this case), this film is an absolute must-see.No Country for Old Men is a new country for cinema; a 5/5 star achievement.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The inevitability,"Grim thriller where the 'hero's' fate is preordained from the start, but one keeps watching. The villain is evil personified, relentless in his determination to prove a point. Ok, ok, we lead small shallow worthless lives in the shadow of death... A sad summing up of existence. I watched this on release and am old enough to already think of it as a classic. I was loathe to rewatch it, but it is so elegantly made and well acted that it went down smooth as the finest bourbon. In the end the film releases itself from its own tension by putting the climax off screen, and ends with a glimmer of hope in someone describing two dreams.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Generation after generation, how to accept the new and not get lost in a pile of old memories.","The Coen brothers tell us a story about three generations and the people who represent them. So, Ed is the twenties, Llewelyn is the sixties, and Anton is the eighties. The main characters completely repeat the archetypes of Western characters from different times. Here I see the idea of duality, because each of them is similar to each other, but at the same time does not accept the changes that they see in the rest of the characters. Ed is a moralist, he is tired of life, of the new society, perhaps he would have lived well if there had not been so much cruelty, as he himself says. Each of us will face this someday, it will be difficult for us to accept the new generation. At the same time, Ed is trying to accept the rules of the new world and even wants to kill Anton, although he himself condemned the murders and the use of weapons. He tries to compromise, but at that moment he sees a void in front of him. Anton is the personification of a clear principle, he acts in accordance with his ""moral code"", if you can call it that. Yes, he kills, but in his world, in the new world, these are just basic survival skills and he cannot condemn himself for this, and is he so cruel and does he kill everyone?- a question for a separate article. As for Llewelyn, he just throws himself into all sorts of things, for him there is no life without adventures and adventures, he is a typical tough guy who may look like a bad guy, but the way everyone wants to be, he is distinguished from Anton by the fact that he uses violence, but only in extreme cases. Each of them, in fact, is a vision of worship on the part of the old man, that is, Ed, but he learns to find a middle ground, Ed retires without stepping over himself and his principles, remaining the sheriff, as he, his father and grandfather were - fair and honest. He is not ready to fully accept something new, but he tries to coexist with it. He already knows that the day will come when he will follow his father, who once also followed his grandfather, and there will be other people and other generations with the same experiences and mistakes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Bold No Country for Old Men,"Starting with the film noir hit, Blood Simple, co-directors and screenwriters, Joel and Ethan Coen have had a productive output of auteur films that range from manic comedies (O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Raising Arizona) to thoughtful crime dramas (Fargo, Millers Crossing). With their latest, No Country for Old Men, they have excelled at personal film-making that just misses the mark by not delivering a more pronounced ending. Under the trappings of a mystery and then chase thriller, this film is an exercise in movie making at its best while taking chances with conventional characters and plot. It also features splendid performances by Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem.Set in 1980 after the Vietnam War, an aged sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), talks of a long line of lawmen in his family. One day, in the desert a welder named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes upon the remnants of a drug deal gone badly and a case of money and decides to take it. It turns out that some Mexicans are on his trail and mean business. So does a mysterious stranger, a clever, psychotic assassin, Anton (Javier Bardem). And the chase is on with Mexicans, the law, and worst of all, Anton, in pursuit. Moss sends his wife Carla to her mom's, and he hightails it to an obscure motel. Apparently a syndicate has hired Anton to get the money and dispatch anyone who gets in the way, but Anton has other ideas and begins to eliminate not just the Mexican competition, but nearly everyone connected with him! Anton's weapons of choice are a lethal air gun and the largest silencer rifle ever. He methodically hunts down Moss through detective work and a tracking device. You know that despite his resourcefulness, Moss is simply overmatched. Meanwhile, the syndicate hires another hit-man, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) to recover the money and eliminate Anton. All the while, Bell is adding up the clues and the growing trail of bodies to form an ominous picture of what is happening and what is to become. As much as he tries to help Moss and his wife, he cannot compete with the likes of Anton. By the end, Bell contemplates retirement knowing a killer is on the loose.Josh Brolin really makes a strong impression as the doomed Moss. His character reminds one of a younger Kris Kristofferson. Not since Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs has there been a hideously terrifying character as Bardem's hit-man, Anton. His calm, dispassionate killer is surely inspired by past movie villains as the ones in Point Blank and The Terminator. Yet, in his own strange way, Anton has his code and motivation. He even gives his potential victims a second chance based on random luck. And he is most unforgiving if he is crossed.There are a number of well constructed scenes to enjoy including a marvelous one at a convenience store which illustrates Anton's manic state, and a moment in a Mexican hotel that is unbearably tense as Moss is cornered in his room by someone who could be Anton.The cinematography by Roger Deakins (The Shawshank Redemption) is quite effective as it illustrates a desolate, barren landscape in which this cat and mouse game is played out.There are a couple problems with the films narrative, however. While it is good that the film attempts and mostly succeeds at being unique and offbeat, a few things are confusing like what really happens toward the end at a motel as Moss waits for his wife. What happens to the money? Some killings are off screen or suggested, and you have to make assumptions based on the context of a given scene.The abrupt conclusion is a bit baffling; it won't work for most audiences, and even the most ardent cinephile may need to digest the last several minutes to make sense of it. Pay attention to the film's underlying theme. Reread the title of the film and understand that it is about the tradition of the lawmen being displaced by a new world order. Jones does a voice over at the beginning and he concludes it with a melancholy lament and recounting of a disturbing dream. If only the structure of the film could convey that more clearly, there would have been a better narrative flow to its finale. Some may call the device brilliant, but it does not work as it may have been intended. But don't let this slip deny the pleasures of a marvelous ensemble of actors and some great camera-work. It could easily be the Coen brothers' best work to date, and that is something to truly appreciate.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not all its cracked up to be . . .,"AT LAST!! Someone else who thinks along the same line as I do about this movie ....... First up, let me tell you all I am VERY easily pleased when it comes to movies, I saw the trailer, read all the hype and thought hey Tommy Lee Jones to boot - a dead cert, no doubt. This film, just like 'I am Legend', COULD have been an absolute belter but I honestly feel it falls just short. In my mind the movie was great for a long time - great suspense, an amazing nutter hunting the money down etc etc but I felt seriously short changed at the end of the film. Why? Too many unanswered questions and the film actually does not end with any kind of conclusion. Is there going to be 'No Country For Even Older Men' coming soon to a cinema near you?",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Sometimes life is just like flipping a coin.,"The Cohen Brothers have struck gold once again with No Country for Old Men. The writing, acting, photography, and just about anything else you could ask for is all here. Well, maybe except a memorable score. But the fact that this film is so haunting without any music is another aspect of it that makes it such an accomplishment. There is enough going on in the two hour running time that one viewing alone certainly would not do it justice.The plot seems simple enough on the surface. A man known as Llewelyn Moss out hunting in rural Texas discovers the aftermath of a drug deal gone sour. Several bodies and shot-up vehicles litter the desert floor. There is a large amount of heroin left at the scene. One victim remains alive, but he isn't going anywhere. He just wants a drink of agua before he dies. To Moss, the only question is... where is the last man standing? The guy who no doubt took the money. It isn't long before Moss tracks the man's corpse down and now holds a satchel containing 2 million dollars. If only he weren't so human, he'd almost surely have gotten away with it....As Moss points out to his wife, someone will be coming after that money. The most prevalent of these people is one of the better recent villains in cinema. Anton Chigurh, as he's known, is a brooding and lethal figure. He has a unique arsenal of weaponry; most notably an air tank that is built for slaughtering cattle. It comes in handy whenever Chigurh encounters a locked door, or sometimes a human in need of slaughtering. Chigurh makes it his mission to hunt Moss down to the ends of the earth to retrieve the money. And apparently to punish Moss for inconveniencing him. Lots of innocent people get caught up in the carnage. Also in the mix is an aging sheriff named Ed Tom Bell. Tommy Lee Jones plays him perfectly. He knows he's out gunned not only in this instance, but in general. He recalls in an early monologue how some sheriffs never used to need to carry guns. Now, all the guns in the world hardly do an honest man any good against the evil that's out there. The film takes plenty of surprising turns and always keeps the viewer guessing. Many would suggest that the film lacks a compelling climax, but this kind of story is more of a morality tale than a standard cops and robbers deal.The Cohens have just about everything down right. Even using skinny male actors to play men at a time (1980) when Americans were not so obese. The action sequences are meticulous and exciting. The violence is brutal, but not completely over the top. There are so many terrific lines of dialog. When Chigurh asks the proprietor of a filling station, ""What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?"", you just know that this will be a line quoted for decades. Just like, ""You talking' to me?"" from Taxi Driver. The acting and casting is so precise that you almost feel like you know these characters as your neighbors or relatives. Even Chigurh, once he's badly wounded in a shootout, begins to seem all too human. Woody Harrelson's character is perhaps just exposition, though. Even so, he's fun to watch.Brolin, Jones, and Bardem deserved Oscar nods. At least Bardem got his. There weren't too many films on par with this one in 2007.

Does This Deserve an Oscar?,"No Country for Old Men is a very good movie, better than I expected it to be. I was disappointed because I expected more action instead of drama. But, I still believe that this movie is a masterpiece.This film is about a guy named Llewyln. He accidentally stumbles upon two million dollars. He decides to take it with him and that is unfortunate. Now he has a bloodthirsty villain with killing as his favorite sport after him. Also, the sheriff's department has to get to the bottom of the mystery.The acting is great. Tommy Lee Jones is still a great actor in these kind of movies. Josh Brolin is wonderful as Llewyln. Javier Bardem is the best, though. He delivers a brilliant performance of the most ruthless villain I have ever seen.This movie is full of suspense and mystery.

Great Coen Brother's movie with no music,"I loved this movie except for the two folks sitting two seats away from me who were probably high on meth because they were laughing hysterically through the entire movie and text messaging with their cell phone!!That being said, Josh Brolin plays the perfect cowboy type character. He is a man who finds some money in a drug deal gone bad. The person who apparently wants to get the money back is played by the older brother in Everybody Loves Raymond. He is a psychopath who kills people with some kind of shotgun that has a SILENCER on it. He also uses an AIR COMPRESSOR to murder folks and also removed locks with it. Very strange if you ask me. Again, there is NO MUSIC in this entire movie. Just a lot of good dialogue and character development. I was very impressed.There was blood. Oh yes, there was indeed blood.

It is a very good movie, superbly shot and scripted, with great timing and fantastic acting. But it is too self-conscious to be engrossing, and as the movie progresses, the sombre gravitas becomes a bit of a caricature, perhaps even a crutch.Despite being a truly great work of film making, on some level it fails to connect.

I Love The Character,"The main reason I went to see this movie was people won’t keep on talking about it. I love good movie. This also got one of the best reviews of the year and nominated for Oscar and BAFTA, so it’s pretty much an assurance. But what I didn’t expect was an instant classic; this will truly be talk about in years to come (unlike those Crash, The Departed, Million Dollars Baby, and Chicago) (I still wonder if people still remember that those movie actually won an Oscar for Best Picture too?)(Yeah, it was fun at that time, but no one talk about it anymore, so what is the point)What I like about this movie was the driven story with great flow and the character that has been written with so much enthusiasm and characteristic, it very rare nowadays to find things like this in the movie. As much as I don’t really see what happening much in the movie apart from the thrill we get from Anton weather he will decide to kill or not, I find myself extremely enjoying it. It was the character driven story so this is definitely not up for everybody.The casting and the acting got to be the best part in the movie; boys, those actors sure bring those characters out so beautifully. It was a superb acting – Anton was rough, destructive, outlaw, at the same time can be thoughtful and have his own set of rules. Llewelyn Moss is kind, thoughtful but at the same times a fighter, a survivor. Sheriff was old and doing nothing. Man, that Texas accent is really hard to understand.I also love the lighting in this movie, I thought it was clever and save the movie from looking too dry with most shot was in the deserted place. Also great cinematography, not this year best but it was awesome. I think it wills more easily if I say everything was awesome. The story also contains the metaphor that is quite hard to understand; specially the ending.Recommendation: Serious Movie Watcher Should Have It As A Collection.

"Dark, Scary, and Fantastic","I have loved every one of the Coen's dark comedies, and they all have the same great edge to them. However, their latest film, No Country For Old Men, is no such film. The film focuses on three characters. Josh Brolin as Llewellyn, a poor veteran who stumbles upon 2 million dollars, Javier Bardem as Anton Chirguh, a sociopath who is after the money and will let nothing get in his way. Bardem gives the best performance because he is so inhumane but attempts to have mercy. He is one of the scariest villains I have ever seen. Lastly Tommy Lee Jones as Ed Tom Bell, the sheriff who follows their footsteps. The film is mostly told through Jones's character, but all three characters have their own moments where they are telling the story. Every year comes a film that makes you grip your seat. This is the one. The whole movie feels so real as Brolin and Bardem play cat-and-mouse with one another. Part of the reality is that there is no music, and there is no soundtrack playing in the background in real life, and without the music you feel more in the movie, like it is happening to you. The Coen brothers know exactly what they are doing and as a result they make the best movies. 10/10 or A",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Attention to detail,"I just saw the movie for the 4th time this afternoon. I guess you could say I'm a fan. I saw the movie, read the book, then saw the movie three more times. Never saw a movie that followed the book as closely as NCFOM. If possible, the book is even bleaker than the film.There's a scene where Ed Tom Bell pulls up in his car and when he shuts it off, you can hear the car has a pre-ignition problem. Boy could I relate to that, especially when you consider the movie is set in 1980. Little things like that just make the movie so believable. I have to admit the ending did surprise me the first time but after reading the book and seeing the movie again, it fits perfectly. I watched I Am Legend last night and enjoyed it but NCFOM is a classic. For those expecting a typical Hollywood fare, stay home.

Unreality,"Like so many others, I went to see this movie based on the good reviews and high score on IMDb. None of my friends have seen it, so I got no warning of what was in store.Everything here is my opinion, I bought it on the flea marker :) The movie starts out well, I was impressed with the style, camera work and the down to earth choices the characters made. This lasted as long as there were no dialogs though. From that point on I started to feel uneasy, things just didn't connect. I started to notice how unreal the whole setup was and how illogical the story worked. In the end I felt that there was no conclusion or ending at all, because I couldn't figure out why anything really happened or ended and what the motivation of the characters was.It wouldn't be so bad if I could find some underlying message, or at least the movie put me in some different mood when I started to watch it. But no, I could feel nothing for the characters, because there was no connection on any level. And if there was some underlying message, that was overshadowed by the massive violence and imagery.Maybe I could find something enjoyable/thought provoking about this movie on a second viewing, but I just cannot bring myself to watch it again.BTW, I would have given it 4/10 for the visual style, but I don't want to see this movie anywhere near the TOP 250, thus the 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Entertaining,"Sure, maybe No Country For Old Men did deserve Best Picture in 2007, but the movie is no instant classic or cinematic masterpiece.

For some it felt like, a villain, the good guy, the ordinary action and a mild ending. My input on the movie is sort of similar, instead the villain was truly bad-ass, there was doses of suspenseful scenes and a good ending. It's no masterpiece, it won't be looked back at as one of the best movies of the decade, just a fine action with some in-depth characters and a informative villain.

With good reason,"Reason has come to life on the silver screen. But not as we know it. ""No Country for Old Men"" brings us reason as described by Neal Stephenson in ""Snow Crash"". Reason is a weapon. But not just any weapon. It's the ultimate weapon, wielded by a mysterious man (Bardem) the Sheriff (Jones) thinks is not a man at all, but a ghost. Retired welder Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) fails to read the signs. He pays a stiff price, for a very unreasonable act of charity, when he comes face to face with reason. It's a hopeless endeavor to point out subtle scenes or magical moments, simply because there are so many of them. At the same time, this movie is much more than a string of scenes. Suffice it to say neither human law nor divine intervention have any way of stopping the sheriff's lonesome ride into the darkness. While the movie meets the high standards of superior craftsmanship and quirky humor we have come to expect from the Coen brothers, it also achieves a new level of coherence and subtlety. It's much closer to ""Blood Simple"" and ""Fargo"" than to ""The Big Lebowski"" or ""Intolerable Cruelty"". It's also a tribute to past masters of the genre. Just as Sheriff Bell tries to prove himself worthy of the legacy of long-forgotten law enforcement officers, the directors try to hold their own in the celebrated company of John Ford, Howard Hawks, John Sturges, or Fred Zinnemann.

"""Just how dangerous is he?"" - ""Compared to what? The bubonic plague?""(from the dialog about Anton Chigurh)","""No Country for Old Men"" is a typical in the good sense Brothers Coens' film. In their new Crime /Drama / Western/Thriller, adapted from Cormac McCarthy's novel of the same title, Coens explore the subject they seem to be very interested in: the crime gone wrong, the temptations it promises, and how it involves and affects the basically good and decent people who suddenly find themselves running for their very lives with death just one step behind or even closer. It is bloody, gripping, extremely atmospheric, darker then dark, with the tension that makes your anticipation of the horrible things to happen even stronger than actually watching these things happen, and with typical for Coens humor that they find in the darkest places. If anything, the movie introduces the evil of such quiet, demented, determined, and meticulously deadly force in the character of Anton Chigurh in the performance of life time by Javier Bardem that it will set the new standards of the screen villain from now on. Bardem plays ruthless, slow speaking, coin tossing hit man who would always finish his job, keep his word, and follow his own twisted code of ethics. His favorite killing weapon is a pneumatic air gun and I am not sure when I was scared more, when Bardem used his weapon or when he politely talked and smiled with that blood freezing smile of his. I will be very surprised if Bardem does not receive the Oscar for his performance.The film has infuriated almost as many viewers as it has satisfied with the unorthodox road it took somewhere 30 minutes before the ending. I can only say, if you want a nice and neatly wrapped up cool little thriller, go and see a Hollywood movie.

Fantastic Movie...Friendo.,"Joel and Ethan Coen pull off their best work since Fargo, and maybe The Man who Wasn't There, and like in Fargo, they come up with a tour De force of writing, directing, acting and cinematography.No Country for Old Men is albeit a complex movie, it's certainly not a movie you can fully digest in one sitting, this review is boldly written after just two sittings, yet, that doesn't necessarily mean that it's an over the top art house movie for twelve people. The movie, being a classic Coen brothers movie, it's very entertaining from beginning to end. The story is a grabber from the start, and their narrative, so rich in the small details that make you buy into the action even more.The performances are all great, there's no main character or anything, I don't think we could really call Tommy Lee Jones the protagonist, this is more of an ensemble piece, and as en ensemble, it's fantastic, there's not a single weak link, all of the actors were extremely effective. Tommy Lee Jones gives a great, subtle, and poignant performance as a Keystone Texas Sheriff, Josh Brolin is great as the laconic Texas loner, Kelly MacDonald is extremely convincing and honest as the Texan trailer housewife, I immediately forgot her original thick Scottish accent and completely bought her uncanny Texan accent, she was an inspired piece of casting. Woody Harrelson was quite effective as usual.I've been saving however, the best for last, Javier Bardem's chilling performance is the one that shines and stands out the most, his portrayal of Anton Chigurh is one of the most chilling performances since probably Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. I know the world chilling is tossed rather lightly these days, but trust me, Bardem's really earns the adjective, his cold hearted, yet human and realistic portrayal of Chigurh is memorable, he has created, along with the Coen brothers, a memorable an assassin as The Terminator or Hannibal Lecter.The film has an impressive look, kudos to the always amazing Roger Deakins for a strong looking cinematography, imposing long shots of the Texan country side, as impressive as North Dakota's white desert looks of Fargo, as well as an extensive use of shadows, very good stuff.The Coens writing is palpable, as well as their direction, all of the strange and curious details of middle Americans of rural and remote areas, the rather film noir plot the movie deals with, as well as the trials and tribulations of the veteran Sheriff, the riffs between husband's and wives, and the minutia details of crime, they all sum up to a very entertaining, if at times puzzling and challenging film.This movie is certainly extremely poetic, you do have to pay attention and digest some of the information very carefully, and, well, there's nothing wrong with that.This movie is easily one of the best of the year, one of the Coens best movies, and, well, just a complete masterpiece. Congratulations all around.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Great, till the last 1/2 hour!","What happened to the ending on this? Did they run out of money to pay writers so they just made it up on the spot?? This began as an interesting movie, captured me, and held my interest fully throughout until about the last 30 minutes. Until that point, there were great performances and the story was intriguing. After that, it kinda flopped. Can't easily explain without revealing details, but I'd say there were scenes missing that should have been there, and the ending just cut off. Lots of unanswered questions, no justice, and a main character that seems to have been a side story, having no real purpose to the movie.If the ending would have been better, I probably would have given it 9/10! Unfortunately, they dropped the ball on this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not for everybody,"This film is not for everybody. But then, ""Le nozze di Figaro"" isn't for everybody, either. I knew next to nothing about the film before seeing it, and absolutely nothing about Javier Bardem. The latter ignorance was certainly to my detriment, because Bardem is a brilliant actor. I will make a point to see his past work. The writing, directing, photography, and acting in this film---all brilliant. Granted, even recognizing that, there are many who will not enjoy it. And there are flaws, to be sure. Some of the acting for minor characters was just passable (I didn't enjoy Stephen Root's performance, although I like him as an actor, and Beth Grant as Carla Jean's mother approached annoying). Bardem and Brolin, however, delivered powerful and memorable performances. The pacing and mood will be a matter of taste. I thought them sublime, and I found myself wanting to absorb every second of every scene. Many scenes were as beautifully played notes, and I missed them as soon as they ended. If you prefer the passive movie experience, with every plot point served up to you with a side of fries, then you won't enjoy this film. There's nothing wrong with preferring such direct storytelling; some people just like to relax and absorb. But if you don't enjoy thinking about the films you experience, this piece may leave you confused and unsatisfied. If, however, you like to be engaged, you'll find the storytelling gripping and the acting riveting. If you are that type, No County for Old Men is not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Cool and smart, but not in a good way","Cool and smart, but not in a good wayThe setting, or range of settings, in No Country for Old Men--the chilly, dry, silent southwestern desert--is wonderfully chosen and perfectly photographed. I'd always wanted to see it used in a movie, and pictured in just this way. I'd found it in fiction occasionally, e.g. in the Lew Archer novels, but not on film, that I can remember. And the story of this movie suits it: a story about a crook, a semi-crook, and a lawman driving across the miles of highways and desertscapes in pursuit of one another. I also can't remember another movie that points up the amount of long and tedious driving it takes to follow somebody.But with all that, the feeling of the place is missed. The vast spaces are shown, but not how they strike the eye if you're staring across them; the light is caught exactly, but not how it hits the eye if you're using it to see by. The soul-replenishing, or soul-eroding, atmosphere--the chill, the dryness you feel in your throat, the lonely silences--never comes across on film. It's a place where you can hear your own breath, hear the motor of a distant car, see its headlights on the horizon, and wonder uneasily what it's doing out on the road at that time of night; a figure distantly silhouetted against that background takes on a crisp-edged ominousness. This movie pictures the figures, the edges, and the background, but doesn't convey the threat: not even when a murderer is looming up behind an unsuspecting victim.Why not?I think, for one reason, because the people in this movie, and the tools of harm they carry with them, have a way of arranging themselves into formal, academic compositions. The men move, rather than being moved; deliberately and without urgency, and with no deep-felt needs driving them: even a greedy man willing to be shot for some hidden money, even a man who has been shot and is begging for water. The movie is more conscious of its own wishes than those of its characters.Indeed, I'd say self-consciousness is its most distinguishing quality. A writer on writing once advised that if a sentence seems unusually good to the author, he should remove it, because it's sure to be too clever and to call undue attention to itself. The same is true of movie-making. The characters in this movie are so busy moving into the right configuration for the shots that they never have a chance to stretch their legs; the movie is so busy being like a movie that it never has a chance to be born. Like several other recent Best Picture winners and nominees, it's an exercise to please the filmmakers more than a performance to entertain an audience.I had trouble following it. I kept losing the thread, was never sure how the characters found the people they were looking for. Either that was not explained, or it was simply not interesting enough: not only because the characters' actions had no driving force behind them (in addition to being carried out at one-third the speed that might have held the attention) but also because the characters themselves--the main ones, at least--were blanks.In this respect the movie reminded me of Wim Wenders's road pictures, where the subsidiary characters (usually women) whom the heroes meet and discard along the way are invariably more lively than the heroes themselves. The people in this movie who piqued my interest were the nobodies, such as the owner of the gas station and the manager of the trailer park. I'd rather have stayed with them, and watched them puttering around in their offices doing nothing in particular, than returned to the main action, because those people had lives, they were about something--something trivial, perhaps, but something. The men at the center of the movie seemed to be about nothing, even when killing or keeping from being killed. To me they were ciphers.So the movie reminded me of something else as well: the presidential contest that followed shortly after, if it wasn't going on at the time. Here was contest between two men both of whose identities were mysterious; I had some idea of where they'd come from, but no idea where they were going: just like the men in this movie. And most observers didn't seem concerned to ask; seemed content to leave them to it and continue to observe, dispassionately and at a distance: just like the movie makers. So maybe they're on to a real trend in our society, after all.The one movie of theirs I've liked was O Brother Where Art Thou? In that I thought I saw a genuine affection for the period, the place, and, above all, the music being depicted. I haven't seen all their other work, but what I've seen has put me off. It has all seemed too cool and too smart, as though always on the verge of a smirk. That's an attitude I don't take to, on screen any more than in life.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Misunderstood Coen Brother's Masterpiece,"Based on the reviews I've read previous to writing my own review, many people feel this movie has plot holes and makes no sense. Let me help those who are looking to see this great piece of film making.The story is about a normal guy named Moss who goes hunting and stumbles upon 2 million dollars in cash from a drug deal (we don't witness) that obviously goes bad. By taking the money he is now being hunted by both the Mexican dealers and a psychopathic killer on the hunt for the stolen money. What I believe many people don't understand is that Moss can be considered the central character in this film backed by an incredible story.I do have to agree that it does tend to slow down towards the end of the film. And I may not like to admit it, but I feel Tommy Lee Jones character tends to slow the movie down a bit. The fact that he is clueless while on the chase in every scene slows down the pace of the film. Other than that, Josh Brolin is great as the lead in this film, and Javier Bardem is simply flawless as Chigurh.Thrilling, suspenseful, and amazing. I rate this an 9 out of 10.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The movie is about a man who kills people till he finds his money.,The movie No Country For Old Men was one of the best movies I have ever seen. The acting in that movie is unbelievable. Once you have seen it you just cant stop thinking about it. I am the type of person who isn't really into types of movies like No Country For Old Men but once i saw it I wanted to see it again. It was so captivating and thrilling to see. I think that Javier Bardem does an excellent job on portraying such an evil character. It seems so authentic that way he does it. He has just become my favorite villain of all time. His quiet actions and charisma on screen makes you wonder if he is any way like his character off screen. Trust me this is an excellent movie.,9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Outstanding.,"I watched this film 3 times back to back to back on a long flight and absolutely loved it. Most people I recommended it to came back lukewarm though.Something to bear in mind is this is not an action film. Go into it expecting something more along the lines of Seven or Silence of the Lambs.This film will leave a lot of questions in your mind and it won't spoon feed you the answers. You are expected to think and come up with some of your own conclusions. And you won't necessarily be happy with them (again I think this rubbed people wrong).Overall though, this is just a great suspense-thriller with some of the best dialog I've heard in years. Anton Chigurh is easily a top 5 on screen villain.It will keep you thinking with you for days if you let it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I Was Pretty Disappointed....,"First of all, I'm a huge Coen brother's fan. They have made some awesomely beautiful, strange, hilarious, gruesome and entertaining movies. I really was so excited to see this, especially with all the Oscar buzz surrounding it. Boy, was I disappointed.I understand that this movie is based on a book, so maybe that's my problem with it. I didn't read the book. It was beautifully shot, and well acted, but so confusing, and with some characters that just make you go ""what were THEY in this for?"" Javier Bardem's character is, in a word, disturbing. I never knew what true evil could look like and act like, and he personified it perfectly. No shock he won the Oscar for supporting Actor. He deserved it.If you read the book, I suppose the movie would be awesome for you, but for me, it left a lot of unanswered questions, and when it ended, I was just left shaking my head. So many pointless things going on, and no real reason for so much of it. Just a strange, strange movie. I would not recommend it, and that's a shame, because I know the Coens' are true masters of their craft. Usually, anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
How can you NOT see this film,"Well first of all I was not expecting anything. Why? because you just know that you cant ""expect"" anything from a Coen Brothers film you have to experience it.So what can I say about the movie without spoilers, because you cant just say them really you would in this case ruin the film.Lets start at the beginning I went to a screening of this movie. I read the title and thought ""hmm not a really zippy flashy title"" it doesn't really say anything about the film _before_ you watch it. But I think that was what they headed for ... I always had this little thing in my head telling me to watch out for that perfect moment when the title just hits the spot in the movie. And my god it did hit it. I watched it not just looked at it or was there and well just looked at a screen ... no the movie captivates. The Actors just fab! Its like your there as a silent watcher in the film not just sitting there. You feel the characters as people and not ""actors"" going through the ( sometimes painful ) stages of acting out a character.It is one of the best movies I have seen in ages that has been made in the last few years. Not great classics or good old ... no its new fresh and coen!When you get round to actually thinking again after the movie you notice that is the perfect combination of great acting great story and that little fizz you just haven't had in the movies for a long time.The characters pull you in they are simple and complex at the same time they are what they are and you accept them to the full. You might not agree with them or think why did he do this ? But then you see it you understand it and get the picture. No big whys and whats and where. No HUGE plot hole that makes you shake your head.So if you want a film that captivates and makes you experience theater and movies like you did the very first time ... then this is it.I really loved it and im waiting for the DVD :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Not bad, for an average film","I'm well aware of the Cohen's fame and I also know what to expect from their films, regardless the horde of fanatics awaiting the next ""Cohen revelation"" and supposedly semi-intellectual old school classic. This film is not any different. Artistically, quite enjoyable. Nice photography, interesting characters, not a bad film to spend the night in the couch for. Now, as groundbreaking, blow-minding cinematography, little here. This film contains exactly the same topics the Cohen tend to use again and again. So I guess you will like it if you, like many others, worship them. Still, this is not a deep movie. It pretends to be, perhaps, can't judge on that since I don't know what was in the directors head. It may just be the actual public and their comments who give it that feeling. No country for old men is a plain and sort of predictable film. This doesn't take any charm away. It also doesn't make it the best film of the year. In any case, I know Cohen's worshipers will continue to think that I don't have a clue and I will continue to roll my eyes. Again, not a bad movie if you are into average, well executed cinematography. However, this is not by any means the great masterpiece so many claim it to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Movie That Tries and Fails.,"No Country for Old Men is a film that undeniably possesses a watchable narrative. However it falls short of achieving greatness. The narrative manages to hook the you in from the start, but it fails to provide any substantial payoff or resolution to the gripping setup. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, but the lack of a satisfying conclusion can leave some feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled.One of the better parts of the movie is it's talented cast. Each actor playing their respective roles admirably. The performances are compelling and they add a depth to the overall atmosphere of the film. Nobody stands out as being bad as they all contribute to the film's dark and suspenseful tone. From the embodiment of evil and death, to an old time sheriff and a man that stumbles upon a jackpot and his life moving forward. I believe everyone (not only the main actors) played their parts so very well.However, the film's weak point lies in its ending. The final confrontation, which should have been a climax of tension and emotional impact falls flat and leaves you unsatisfied and wanting more. There is a sense of disappointment and detachment as the narrative concludes with loose ends, failing to provide closure or a resolution to the intense buildup of events. As some search for a deeper meaning and metaphors in the movie, the movie may appear to be a masterpiece. However, for some (including myself), the attempt at deep and thought-provoking storytelling feels forced and unconvincing. Despite watching numerous YouTube videos dissecting the film's supposedly hidden meanings, it remains a frustrating and unfulfilling experience. The movie strives to be more than a mere crime thriller, but in doing so, it loses sight of its primary purpose to satisfy the viewer. Maybe I'm looking at it wrong and it isn't meant to satisfy you. But though all the movies I have ever seen that have an amazing and thought-provoking ending, they all leave you satisfied by the conclusion.Overall, is a good film with an intriguing story and strong performances from the cast. It manages to hook the viewers from the beginning but unfortunately, it fails to deliver the emotional payoff and resolution that it promises. The ending and the final confrontation before hand may leave some with a sense of frustration as the film struggles to live up to its potential as a masterpiece. Despite its good moments, the movie falls short of being the gripping and thought-provoking experience it aims to be, leaving some ultimately unsatisfied.I would recommend watching the movie once over as it's a good movie.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
In the world of Coen,"Half way into this movie I was still positively upset that this was probably going to be the first time I would ever actually enjoy a Coen movie. We all like what we like but none of their prior movies (And I did see them all) did anything other for me than bore or annoy.Of course I should have known better because the very reason the Coen productions annoy me is that none of their movies take place on earth. No-Country-for-old-Men turned out to be no exception. Far from it even.Somewhere in a paralleled universe there is a little blue ball of mud and water that looks very much like our own planet. The difference between our world and this one is a difference in certain laws of logic.On planet Earth as I know it, if a dude in scene 1 would tell a dying Mexican to go fork himself when he's asking for water, walking away with 2 million dollars with no expression on his face, he would probably not have problems with his conscience a couple of hours later only to fill up a cannister of water and go back in remorse. On my world, if a cop would be killed, there would probably be a thorough investigation (even in Texas). But not in the world of the Coens. If a man with a funny hairdo would walk around a town or a motel with a 90 inch hand-cannon with a strange aluminum front, people on earth would call the police. But not on planet Coen. The list goes on filling up a roll of toiletpaper if one would take the time.And there you have it. Where in normal films one is required to suspend some disbelief, in this movie you'd have to let it slide altogether. And that is exactly where the movies for me quit to entertain. They annoy more than they amuse even though set-designs, acting and cinematography are almost always on par with any quality movie or even above.And like this wasn't enough to cast serious doubt on this production, they put in a terrible anticlimax of an ending...dared but ultimately flawed and annoying. -SPOILER-START- How they expected to get away with showing a movie for 1.5 hours, closely following the protagonist, and having him being killed off-screen in a 12 second scene, is beyond me.-SPOILER-END- And since when is mumbling some cod-philosophical verbal diarrhea a good replacement for closure in a movie which desperately needed some sensible conclusion? I know that the entire theater I watched this movie with felt exactly the same about this. Everyone was going 'huh?', 'This is it?' or started apologizing for picking the movie to the people they were with or even started arguments with employees of the theater. Everyone felt unanimously cheated. And this set against the incredible high praise this movie has received, makes absolutely no sense.If I had to judge the movie based on the first half of it, it would have scored a 7,5 in my book because it was all delivered convincingly and graciously although a bit meandering at times. But such a lousy and unsatisfying ending should not go unpunished, especially in the reviews of the movie-critics who write their reviews for the moviegoers and not for themselves nor their peers nor the Coen Brothers.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I've been a Sheriff of this town for twenty-five years...,"No Country For Old Men - The Coen Brothers (2008) A brutal eclipse of modern-day crime-thrillers, Ethan and Joel Coens 'No Country For Old Men' paints a disturbingly violent and beautiful image of the developing slippery slope in which society is slowly falling down.Starting with visually stunning shots of the baron landscape which becomes a staple of the whole film, the Coen's quickly and vividly materialize 'No Country For Old Men' into one of the most tense and suspenseful films of the last ten years. It quickly advances into a vicious chase across Texas as the deviously psychotic hired-hand in Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) attempts to track down Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a back-ward country boy who happened to stumble upon a Mexican drug deal gone bad and help himself to the $2.4million left in the dying hands of the 'last hombre standing', which sets into motion a series of unstoppable and deadly events of which gives ageing Sheriff Tom Ed Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) a chance to reflect upon what he's doing and who in today's modern world, he's facing.From the moment Tommy Lee Jones mutters ""I've been a Sheriff of this town for twenty-five years"" to his final profound epilogue at the end of the film, the acting throughout is sustained at a very high rate. Javier Bardem in particular, is fantastic as the psychotic, no-nonsense, pure incarnation of evil; hired-hit-man Anton Chigurh (however he does have principles in a very funny sort of way...). Every time Bardem is on-screen, his presence radiates throughout the whole film as you know that death is just around corner, while Brolin plays his counter-part to-a-tee, a fearless redneck living out in the desert sands of Texan outback, who is willing to fight Chigurh and the Mexicans to the last-strands of death for the drug money, and is willing to put his wife, the delectable Kelly MacDonald, in the firing line of those around him too.Roger Deakins beautiful cinematography, of the baron wasteland which all the events of the film are laid out, supports Cormac McCarthy's adapted novel brilliantly. The Coens decision to adapt the novel, with little-to-no tinkering allowed the full beauty of such a deep and thought-fuelled novel to come to life in only the way in which Ethan and Joel Coen could. In an age of CGI and 'green scenes', it's nice to see such an articulated film that ticks every single box for the basic fundamentals of film-making and in such a thought-provoking way too. 'No Country' throws you in at the moral and ethical deep-end and with no back-story, asks you to make a decision, and it's the Coens finest film to date.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
the passing of time,"It is a pity to read comments that ask ""have i missed something"" after watching No Country For Old Men. The movie, whose title was taken from Yeats' Sailing To Byzantium poem reflects none of the optimism that the poet displays about youth...""That is no country for old men. The young / In one another’s arms, birds in the trees."" The movie, as i interpreted it, is about the passing of time, of generations, of things changing and how people deal with times that they do not, or even want to, understand. Yes, the movie is a crime thriller...there is the thrill of the chase, the Coen brothers' artful control of suspense...but it is also about a country that is on the verge of changing dramatically and, since the movie is set in the 1980s, it reflects a point when the nation is becoming what it is today. But hope is not held out to us in any way..the youth (the future generation then, the present one now) portrayed in the movie are not in any way better human beings than the grown ups..it is, as one of the lines goes, ""all about the money."" No Country For Old Men captures a small slice of American history, a time in-between. Similar to the way the movie Network predicts how Television would become an extremely powerful (and not always beneficial) medium, this movie appears to offer a prophecy on how gun culture and money will indeed be what rules America in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
!This decade's film so far... a modern masterpiece!,"I've just seen this film last week when I went to North America. Then, I couldn't believe my eyes, I had heard about the film so much and the expectations were high; however is far, far away from whatever you can hear about it. This is not just a film, is a whole experience which catches you up from the beginning until the end. I can't deny the ending is a little bit confusing for most of the people, nevertheless it's a very smart part of the movie which really makes you think, not only accept what you've seen. Every acting performance is great, everyone in this film is brilliant... Bardem plays a villain who will be remembered through the years, and Brolin is also outstanding as a man who made a big mistake and then try to get away. McDonald brings the light to such dark film, and her role's final scene is a cardinal point to interpret the film by yourself. Lee Jones also shows up with not much screen time, but it's enough to become a key character in all the running time. And what to say about the astonishing cinematography by Roger Deakins... and the score so hallucinating? And of course, in the other hand is the direction: perfect execution by the Coen brothers who make a big comeback with the most intelligent and worthy film of the decade so far, making a wonderful and unbelievable work based on McCarthy's novel. !It's just a masterpiece... there's nothing else to say!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Outstanding work from the Coen Brothers,"No Country For Old Men's opening prologue, spoken carefully and wistfully by Tommy Lee Jones' weary sheriff, tells the story of him having to put a 14-year-old killer in the electric chair. He killed his girlfriend, not because he had a motive, but to see what it would feel like. This opening speech sets up No Country For Old Men, the new release from Coen Brothers - Joel and Ethan, which then goes on to explore that baseless type of evil in the form of Javier Bardem's ruthless, mop-topped killer. He plays Anton Chigurh (how you pronounce his last name is dependant on who says it), a stone-faced killer trying to track down a missing bag of drug money, after a deal goes horribly wrong in the Texan desert. Josh Brolin's local simpleton Llewellyn Moss is the man who took the money after stumbling across the aftermath of the deal-gone-wrong. Everything seems to go remarkably well for Moss until he makes one fatal mistake, leading Chigurh onto his tail. Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff Ed Tom Bell attempts to find Moss before Chigurh does.Apart from being an amazingly tense, and brilliantly shot straightforward genre movie, No Country For Old Men is also a faithfully adapted story that encompasses all the philosophical debates present in Cormack McCarthy's novel. Ed Tom Bell, the beleaguered sheriff weary with the modern world is wondering where the hell society is leading itself. He is convinced, at his mature age, that the world is going to hell in a hand basket, and morality is being sapped from society. But is that really the case, or has the world always been an evil and dark place? The Coens, like McCarthy, clearly think so, despite themselves being at an age when conservative nostalgia evokes a form of pride when you could remember the ""good old days"" of yesteryear. Days when, in your own interpretation, people were nicer and less evil to each other. Anton Chigurh embodies the new kind of evil that people like Bell are forced to face. And Moss is simply the small time player who thinks he can play along with the big guns.The performances are roundly fantastic, but no one draws the audiences' attention quite like Javier Bardem. The Spanish superstar dares the camera to look at him with his almost lifeless eyes, and the cattle gun he uses to mercilessly kill his targets. Undoubtedly, however, the real star of the movie are the Coens themselves. Along with famed cinematographer Roger Deakins, Joel and Ethan have made their best movie in years. After dabbling in fairly flimsy-but-throwaway material like The Ladykillers and Intolerable Cruelty, this sees them back on the form of edgier films like Fargo and Blood Simple. Even though many found themselves at sea with the head-scratching ending, there is no denying that as a piece of genre cinema, this is top quality stuff. As a poetic meditation on the new evils of the world, it is even better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Understatedly Brilliant,"For all of the mindless dolts that didn't like this because it left you to your own interpretations I say go watch Sesame Street.

Outstanding cinematography, the subtle yet effective score and the superb acting of the three male leads, not to mention the supporting cast. The Coen brothers have done it again and crafted a wonderful film which will reveal more nuance and detail with each successive viewing.I can appreciate a film where everything is neatly tied up at the end and we're left with no questions as to what happened with the characters in the story. But I love those movies which leave you with just as many questions as answers, and this movie leaves a lot of questions to ponder. I'll enjoy watching this over and over again.

"Reinvigoritaed brothers rescue Hollywood, nobody notices","Joel and Ethan Coen return to form after a few less then spectacular ""lighter"" outings with this lavish, tense, expertly directed cat-and-mouse thriller which transitions, perhaps too awkwardly, into something quite different in the end.Regardless of a conflicted conclusion (undoubtedly difficult to transition from paperback roots), there are many thoughtfully captured(in no small part aided by Javier Bardem's scene-stealing, warped charisma) action sequences throughout which should elevate No Country above so much faux-visionary b.s. cinephiles desperately search through when compiling scenes to memory; motion that matters.Of course Hollywood is run in such an ass-backwards manner (so seems the taste of a paying general public majority, in fairness) that we will have one of America's most compelling cinematic experiences in years shown in as few theaters as possible. Any true fan of the craft should unfortunately make the lengthy trip.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Coen's are testing to see if junk will fly,"This movie started pretty well, and seemed to have a good plot. Then it slowed down, then it slowed down some more, then even the actors started to talk slower. Then it ended.I think the Coen brothers just wanted to see how many awards they could win for making a terrible movie and everyone would think they were supposed to like it so they would say it was great.I call it the un-movie.. You want an action scene? We will show you where an action scene happened. You want a story line? We will start about 5 stories and not end any of them. You want a hero?

Another great movie by two of my favorite directors,"The Coen brothers are excellent directors, they inspired me to get interested in film. Fargo is another great film by them, but this is probably their best film ever. The social commentary on the increased violence of crimes is a good one. Javier Bardem gives his best performance, Tommy Lee Jones was great as the sheriff, and Josh Brolin did really good in this movie too. The Coen brothers had fun random side characters like they always do. Their direction is great. The cinematography is great, and the violence is important to the story instead of just being violent for shock. All the awards they got are deserved. So mostly every thing about this movie is great, I would even say this is one of my favorite movies of all time. I am giving this a 10/10. I would recommend this to anyone who likes crime thrillers or good movies in general.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No Country for Old Men: A Masterpiece of Tension and Moral Ambiguity,"The Coen Brothers' ""No Country for Old Men"" is a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The film follows the story of Llewelyn Moss, played brilliantly by Josh Brolin, who finds a bag of money in the desert and becomes the target of a ruthless hitman, Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem, who will stop at nothing to get it back. The tension in this film is palpable, and the Coen Brothers masterfully keep you on the edge of your seat with every twist and turn.But what really sets ""No Country for Old Men"" apart is its exploration of moral ambiguity. Chigurh is a terrifying villain, but he's not a typical one. He's not motivated by greed or revenge; he's driven by a twisted sense of honor and an unwavering commitment to a code of ethics. At the same time, the film's protagonist, Moss, is no hero. He's a flawed man who's made a series of bad decisions and finds himself in over his head. And the film's ending leaves you questioning who the real hero is, and whether there are any heroes at all in this bleak and violent world.The performances in ""No Country for Old Men"" are all top-notch, but Bardem's turn as Chigurh is truly unforgettable. He's simultaneously charming and terrifying, and his performance earned him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Tommy Lee Jones is also excellent as the world-weary sheriff who's trying to make sense of the violence around him.Overall, ""No Country for Old Men"" is a must-see film for anyone who loves great storytelling and masterful filmmaking. The tension is palpable, the performances are outstanding, and the exploration of moral ambiguity will leave you thinking long after the credits roll. It's a true cinematic masterpiece that stands the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
No place for anybody,"Another dark and very bloody story by the Coen brothers. But this time it's about symbolism and philosophy. And entertainment.This is about fighting the devil (Javier Bardem), which here appears as a character from some comic book. It makes him more easy to understand. This movie is about confronting evil by intelligence or by morality. Beside it all stands the sheriff (great work by Tommy Lee Jones) as the commentator and he says what you're mostly miss in these kind of films. Some of the characters are dreadful. It's not, I repeat not, acceptable what they do.The camera work is sometimes splendid. But the story doesn't hold together and of course this a speculation in violence. This is not just a piece of art, the selling ambitions are obvious.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Confusing Title, Amazing Movie","People complain about endings way too often. I sat down and watched No Country for Old Men tonight and the entire movie blew me away but the ending is something I will not touch upon in this review but something I am willing to discuss. Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones star in a fight for two million dollars. The Coen Brothers directed this masterpiece and it was all over the Oscars. Llewelyn Moss, Josh Brolin, stumbles on a drug deal gone badly in the middle of the desert in west Texas. He also stumbles upon two million dollars. Anton, Javier Bardem, is on a rampage as he wants to find the money. Ed Tom Bell, Tommy Lee Jones, is following the two of them in a battle for the cash.Movie making is an art form and any good director does everything on purpose. The Coen brothers did everything right in this movie. All three main characters are never seen on screen but are so much alike and connected. If you dig deep into the details in this movie you will notice so many similarities between the three. The directing the two of the brothers do is one of the best I have ever seen in any movie. They choose to have very little music in their movie. That is a very bold and risky move in my opinion, but one that worked out beautifully. Most of the time you hear wind of the desert of a train in the distance. Dogs and children are constantly heard. Its music that makes the movie but also the little things.Javier Bardem scared me. There I said it and I don't regret it. He is straight up evil in this movie. He is evil but he also has a code of ethics or morals. He is the antagonist, the killer, the bad guy, but he is ""fair"". There are a few scenes where he confronts people. Sometimes he kills them and sometimes he does not. The idea of the coin flip and the person gets to make the call and if he/she is right, they get to live. That idea is terrifying and you can see it on the face of a gas station owner. I was on the edge of my seat as he was on the edge of his life.Josh Brolin does a great job in this movie but I hated Llewelyn. First of all I can't spell or say his name and I know that's not a good reason not to like somebody, but hey, it's my opinion. Llewelyn is supposed to be the protagonist but the actions he takes and how he acts I didn't really care if he lived or died. Not because his character was boring or unimportant, but because I knew I was supposed to cheer him on but he was a scumbag. His greed got to him as he became a nutcase with the money. He mistreated his wife, in my opinion, and just wasn't that great a guy to begin with. I hated his character but I loved the role he played in the movie. His end result in the movie wasn't disappointing, meaning I was happy with it, but I would have liked to see a little bit more out of it. There was a scene I needed to see with him in it, but it wasn't there.Tommy Lee Jones is one of those actors who rarely flops and this is not one of them. Ed Tom is the cop trailing behind the two madmen fighting over the money. He has to put the pieces together. His role isn't too major and he kind of pops in and out of the movie, but he is magnificent. I lived his character; he was the real only pure character. This movie needed a guy like Ed Tom. He brought wit and charm to the character and as dark and exciting this movie was, it was also funny.There is a scene I need to talk about. Llewelyn is at the Mexico border, covered in blood, and he runs into three guys. He tells the guy he will give him $500 for his shirt. The guy asks to see the money first. The other guy asks if he had been in a car accident, twice. Llewelyn gives him the money and then asks the other guy for his beer. The third guy asks how much for the beer. Now earlier I said how the three characters are connected. I mentioned this scene in particular; I'll let you figure out the rest. Think about it. It is the pure brilliance in this movie.If I want to talk a flaw in this movie I would say its Woody Harrelson's character. I don't understand why he was there, I didn't find him important and he was a petty minor character. I probably didn't understand his importance because I couldn't understand a word he said. When I watch any movie I throw on subtitles but I watched this for a film class and there were no subtitles. The Texan accent annoyed me to pieces and parts of the movie were hard to understand. I give a pass to Tommy Lee Jones because he is like that and every movie.Overall, No Country for Old Men is an amazing movie. If you are a fan of movies and like a high detailed story than this is for you. If you like good acting and relatable characters than this is for you. If you like wild goose chases tan this is the movie for you. If you like Oscar worthy movies than this is for you. If you like movies that get the WillyT Seal of Approval, than this is the movie for you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Mesmerizing Neo-Western Thriller,"""No Country for Old Men"" is all about evil and the puzzling nature of it. Tommy Lee Jones's character perfectly personifies the audience as it struggles to find all of the perfect little answers to all of the problems that this movie lays out. In a lot of ways, we'll never know every single answer to why some people just do downright awful things. I also really liked a smaller theme that I picked up on, and it probably has connection to the larger theme, I'm not sure. But it's the idea that evil has always been evil, and that older generations, who typically blame what they see as a rise of evil on a rapidly changing time around them, might just be struggling to deal with how evil has adapted to the times they live in. Hence the title of the movie. I especially loved the conversation that Tommy Lee Jones's Sheriff Bell has with his Uncle Ellis (Barry Corbin) towards the end of this film which kind of dealt with this topic of discussion.Particular praise to the directing by the Coen brothers, the cinematography, and an excellent performance by Javier Bardem as the creepy psychopathic criminal Anton Chigurh. A similar performance to Anthony Hopkins in ""The Silence of the Lambs.""The movie completely flips the genres of western and thriller on their heads and stands almost as a critique of all of the ""western as morality stories"" films that used to dominate popular culture. It's a lot deeper than a gruesome thriller movie or an atmospheric western but it also retains the best qualities from both of those.It's a modern masterpiece that's like a huge stew of different themes and genres all stirred to perfection. Absolutely worth watching in my opinion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A slightly flawed work of art,"As always with the Coen brothers a handcrafted, studious effort with acting of the highest order and a no-holds-barred critical view of America, summed up by one character in the film as 'It's a country that's hard on people'. My only reservation was that it was like watching a performance of 'Hamlet' in which Hamlet doesn't turn up for the final duel scene. Frustrating to say the least!But the Coens are admirable in the Shakespearian way they mix humor with tragedy and scorn recourse to any special incidental music effects to enhance the sense of impending doom. They also take their time telling the story. Though I enjoyed it immensely, I would have liked 'Atonement' to have teased things out a bit more if only to give the characters more depth.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Work of Genius,"I have nothing new to say that other before have not already said but 13 years on this is still fresh, intense and a remarkable film in the Coens catalogue especially given their 3 previous to this.

One hell of a film!,"I watched No Country For Old Men on the day it came out. I was completely blown away by it. Everything about it was brilliant. Anton Chigurh is one bad-ass of a villain played superbly by Javier Bardem. It was the first film I had seen that had been made by the Coen Brothers. I got ""No Country"" for my birthday and still think its as good as I saw it in the cinema. I found The Coen Brother's ""Fargo"" for a great price and bought that and thought that was also brilliant. Im looking to find Blood Simple as I have heard many good things about it.

No Country For Old Men,"No Country For Old Men is based upon the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy. The film is about a man named Llewelyn Moss who is hunting in the desert and uncovers a crime scene of a drug deal gone wrong. In his findings he also uncovers a briefcase full of money which he takes home with him. Meanwhile a ruthless killer named Anton Chigurh who wants the money that Llewelyn stumbled upon is now after him and Llewelyn has to watch his tracks and do everything to avoid this crafty man who will stop at nothing to get the money and to kill him also. This was a film that really is an effective thriller. The plot and the different twists are all very clever and unpredictable and unless someone read a spoiler filled review of this movie, or read the book then I guarantee you will also not know which direction this film is going to go in and what is going to happen to the characters. The mood and tension is also brilliantly set up by very little dialog and noise from the main characters and in the stalking scenes the shadows, lighting and the fact that there is little to no music in those scenes further sets up a powerful and thrilling mood and keeps you captivated to see what will happen next. This is also a very good looking film and because of the way it was shot it adds to the film's look that it tries to convey with shadows, darkness and isolated places and rooms that because of the way it was filmed really helps with the atmosphere and mood of the film. When there is talking in the film the dialog is often well written and even when we just see the camera following the characters around and seeing what they do next, this is also a great character study and an examination of what one would do in a certain situation type of movie. After I left the film at the theatre, I didn't feel that everyone in the audience was totally impressed by the film, or the way it was done. I personally found a lot to appreciate with this film and even though the plot sounds generic enough, there really is a lot of intelligence and thought behind it and because of the mood and layout of the film it further enhances just what a thrilling story this is. I also liked how the film was unlike a lot of Hollywood films in a way that it didn't use clichés, or try to do a predictable ending, or anything like that. I also admired the film all the more for that. Even though I liked this film a lot I could definitely seeing myself liking it more and more with repeat viewings and will probably grow to like it even more over time and I think the same could be said for others, or maybe even the few who were in the audience with me who I didn't get good vibes from. This is a film that will probably grow on you each time and each time will enhance your appreciation for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Unpredictable, but not all that captivating","The actors play great, the casting is appropriate and the direction flawless. There is no soundtrack. To me it felt like someone wanted to make a movie that felt real, and so it did. It is hard for me to comment on it without revealing the best part, the thing that one understands only after watching the whole movie.I don't understand why they had to cast Kelly Macdonald (a Scottish actress) as a Texan wife with an Ukrainian mother :)There are people that did not like this movie, and I can understand why. No special effects, no soundtrack to tell you how to feel, lots of dead people, but only for a few do we see how they die, and the only thing to be learned from it is that nothing goes as you want in real life. It was a bit slow at times, too. But it was worth it for the atmosphere and the general effect.Bottom line: This is not of those movies you watch a little at the start and a little at the end and you don't miss anything, it has an overall thing that must be experienced.

"""You can't make this stuff up, I dare you to try""","Masterpiece - ""the most outstanding work of a creative artist or craftsman""...Although this film is creepy, intellectual, offbeat, deliberately divisive, artistically adventurous, engaging, and decisively dreamlike, it is not a masterpiece or anywhere near the Brothers best film. That be Miller's Crossing (1990), possibly their true masterpiece.This is an always interesting character study where the villain is undoubtedly worthy of clinical deconstruction and is awe inspiring and captivating, but the movie is needlessly confusing and constructed by design to be an unsettling, relentless non linear expose of the despair and disappointment in the devolving descent of the human condition.However, it may be too layered and too unclear for it to be ultimately satisfying. It delivers some home spun prose about the inner mind of straight and stalwart people caught in this web of modern criminal behavior that pushes the oldsters off the cliff, but not before some sadistic torture.There are some darkly funny and cynical quotable lines one expects from the Coen's and when this movie works it presents some new and fresh carnage that raises the hackles and chills the spine. It is a Neo-Noir of nihilistic novelty that is very good, but can be a frustrating and an overall disappointment if one is expecting this film to be a classic.

"Thriller, heart-pumping, with actual stakes","This is probably the most realistic film I've ever seen, no music, silence and just the sounds of the moment; whether it be death, tension, or a conversation, this movie feels there it feels like you're actually there. The plot is quite simple, an opportunity of a lifetime is presented to a man who stumbles upon it and it leads to a chase of a lifetime. What accompanies is a game of cat and mouse, with so many moving parts you can't help but watch as it all comes tumbling down. One thing that can serve as a disconnect is how real the violence is portrayed, it's almost so graphic it's disgusting. Like I was watching with my wife and we almost had to turn the tv off from one scene, and yet it resonates and it leaves you watching till the end. It's also a very introspective film, like the messages and the dialogue way heavily on you after it's finished. I have to say it's one of my favorites, and if you're into the most necessary films of the century, this one falls among that category,",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""You cant stop what's coming...""","Dont read my review. Just watch it. You know, some masterpieces you just gotta experience yourself.

Because WHEN you would have known the Coen Brothers, you would have seen EVERYTHING they made already and you wouldnt be reading these reviews. The Coen Brothers didnt exclusively made classics, some of their farcical comedies are flops. But ALL of their drama/thrillers are definitely worth watching. This one though reaches movie heaven. ""No Country for Old Men"" has been awarded with multiple oscars and an abundance of other awards worldwide. This movie is truly a modern classic of the highest order, equalling the brilliance of their earlier work like ""Blood Simple"", and ""Barton Fink"".The story in a nutshell: a hit man (Javier Bardem) goes on a killing spree in order to find a lost bag loaded with drug money, which was accidentally found by Josh Brolin, who plays a trailer trash redneck. The extremely suspenseful pursuit by the hit man is what the story is about. Tommy Lee Jones plays the sherrif who investigates the killing spree that comes along with this suspenseful pursuit of the money bag.This is NOT a mindless funny action popcornmovie. Please stay away from it if you are only into mindless entertainment. Or do watch it and get pummeled by the psychotic mood that prevails in this classic. It killed any happy mood I had, after I had watched it for the first time. But it did so in a way that is brilliant. As brilliant as the Coen Brothers can be!No one besides the Coen Brothers themselves have this extraordinory talent to make a scene interpretable in different ways. In many scenes it aint certain if one should laugh or cringe with fear. These twin director brothers have perfected a style in which they walk a tightrope between black humor and sheer psychotic suspense. Spooky note: actor Woody Harrelson's father (in real life) was a contract killer for a drugslord. Since this movie is all about contract killing, this biography fact is spooky and chilling since Woody Harrelson is pursuing a contract killer in this movie.Everything and I mean really everything is perfected in this movie. From acting, to photography and editing. And the story and dialogues are just way of the charts, way outhere. Those dialogues in some scenes are without a doubt the most thought provoking and eery dialogues I have heard in a long time.Seen it over 10 times and I am still in awe of it every time. I can still remember so vividly HOW I felt the very first time I saw it. Because I was left with a very UNcomfortable feeling afterwards. I felt lost and bleak inside.

His killing ways . .,"I once heard Alain Delon give a definition of the difference between ""un comedien"" and ""un acteur"". The former, he said, interprets a character, whereas the latter becomes the character. By this definition, Javier Bardem is a great actor. Others who spring to mind are Daniel Day Lewis and Gary Oldman. This is rarefied company indeed, but yes, Bardem belongs here, as anyone who sees his performance in this film as Anton, the cold-blooded automaton of a killer, who dispenses death indiscriminately and without feeling, can testify.Bardem turns in a towering, unforgettable performance which will probably win the Oscar in 2008 for best supporting actor. His impact is immediate, and he completely overshadows the rest of the cast. Tommy Lee Jones (Ed Tom Bell) is himself, as he always is, and Josh Brolin (Llewellyn Moss), turns in a professional, but unremarkable performance in the lead role. I liked him better as Detective Trupo in American Gangster.This is a violent film; chock full of indiscriminate, mindless killings. In Anton's world, human life has no value, to live or die is a random game of chance, decided upon a whim, a chance remark, the flip of a coin. He strides through this world with impunity, invincibility, devoid of the slightest hint of conscience or responsibility for his actions. He really doesn't give a damn, and yet he has his own, personal code of honour. He does take pride in his work, and always gets his man.But beware, once you have allowed the images of Anton to imprint themselves on the back of your retina, they will be indelible. You will never forget him. The character he creates is that powerful. The haircut, the clothes, the walk, the mannerisms, the voice, and his manner of killing, all combine to create a chilling, soulless, remorseless individual, devoid of saving graces.True to expectations, with their pedigree, the Cohen brothers have produced a sharp, atmospheric, potent and original film, and there are many surprises in store in this three-way ""catch me if you can"" chase across the USA and Mexico. There is almost no music, but I am sure that hardly anyone will notice, such is the strength and quality of the script, the direction and the sheer momentum of events.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Film That Will Keep You on the Edge of Your Seat,"The suspense, western, drama No Country for Old Men is directed by the Coen brothers and stars Josh Brolin, Javier Bardem, and Tommy Lee Jones. The film takes place in 1980 Texas.The film starts off with a man, Anton Chigurh (Bardem), being arrested. He is then brought to the police station and the officer who arrested him is on the phone. He is able to get his handcuffs under his legs and then brutally strangles the officer to death and frees himself, steals a police car, kills another person and steals their car. Then it cuts to Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) hunting deer. While checking to see if he hits one he notices an arranged of vehicles in a field. He goes over and sees that there has been a large gunfight and finds a lot of drugs in the back of one of the trucks. Soon he finds a satchel that contains two million dollars inside of it. The rest of the film is about how Moss tries to make it away with the money while being chased by Chigurh and while Chigurh is being chased by a local sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Jones).The screenplay for this film was excellent. It was extremely suspenseful and all the main characters had great depth to them. Anton Chigurh will be a character like Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver that will be remembered for a very long time. Also I thought the ending was very deep, along with the rest of the film. Personally it is my favorite Coen brother film I have seen, but I still have to see a good amount of their films.The direction of this film was excellent and it well deserved the Oscar for it. To make a film this suspenseful without the use of music is extremely difficult and the Coens pull it off brilliantly. It is an edge of your seat film for the older generation, not just for the teens like most of the suspense films that come out these days. The Coens have proved yet again that they can get brilliant performances out of their actors. Truly an amazing job in the direction department.The acting for this film was as well brilliant. Josh Brolin played the lead and it truly brought him to now become one of the biggest actors in Hollywood. He was a stubborn Texas man that just wasn't going to quit and he was absolutely perfect. Javier Bardem delivered one of the greatest performances of the decade in his role and will go down in history for it. He deserved that Oscar so much that they shouldn't have even nominated anyone else in the category. Jones played his part fine, it just seems that he is a police officer in every movie and it is pretty annoying. This is an excellently acted film.Overall I give this film a 9/10, and I have no complaints with it winning the Best Picture Oscar, even though I like There Will be Blood more. I would recommend this one for anyone who likes great suspense films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Wow, an insanely gripping movie","It's simple, yet carried by great actors and great dialogue, tension, and some really awesome old western vibes.I'm not really into westerns, and I don't know if this even classifies as one, or is just wearing a western's clothing, but I loved it a lot. At least two thirds of it...Other than the fact that I had to use subtitles in order to understand what the heck anyone was saying, I've got no other small complaint.But I do have a big one - and it's pretty obvious - the ending. For most of the movie, it seemed like it was obvious where it would lead. A lot of movies lead to that.And now I see why - because it's expected, and makes sense, it's a reward for the viewer for watching for so long and caring for those characters.Unfortunately, we get a pretty abrupt and underwhelming ending to an otherwise captivating movie, and... well, there's no easy way to say it - but it's a terrible way to end it.It's not cool or unique or ""subverting expectations"", it's just disappointing, and leaving viewer with that feeling.Here I thought I was watching an epic fight between two great forces of men. Turns out, the boring sub-plot about an uninteresting and generic aging sheriff was the main plot line here. And that's supposed to be my reward for sticking with those characters for two hours, hoping for a proper resolution.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
NCFOM is one tough nut to crack..but I will give it a shot.,"No Country For Old Men 7-2-08 NCFOM is one tough nut to crack. This is a film with no central character/protagonist but its not exactly what I'd call an ensemble piece. The most memorable character could easily be called the villain, but can you have a villain w/o a ""hero""? Perhaps thats (one of) the point(s) to the film. The over all feeling I'm left with by the time the credits roll (btw love the font used during the credits) is best described by that wonderful line from Natural Born Killers ""The whole world's comin' to an end"". Now of course thats not to meant in a revelations kind of way but more in the curmudgeonly old man complaining about the damn kids and how things were different/better when he was a boy. The film seems like one long version of that...but in the best possible way. Its a film that manages to be several things though not all at once. It's a thriller that is at times pensive. There is no big bang climax though you might be expecting one. I wasn't particularly disappointed by this fact because by the time it got to the logical point where a big bang climax would have gone (if this were another film) I sort of understood that wasn't the point. What is the point though, im certain it has something to do with violence. Has its gotten worse or is it always been this bad? I haven't quite figured it out yet but I'm rather fond of any film that doesn't telegraph its message to the audience. Or maybe I'm just dince and it does. Never the less I'm happy to watch this film many times over and think about it. At the end of the day maybe thats the point.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Relentless evil,"A lot has been written about the Coen brothers's new crime thriller No Country for Old Men. Nearly all the reviews have been ecstatic and touched on the many qualities of this masterpiece so I really have nothing new to add. But, I just saw it two hours ago and it has left me reeling. So, I really have to get my feelings off my chest and touch on some aspects of the film that immediately come to mind. This is not a plot synopsis.Its too early for me to collect my thoughts and say this is their best film. I've been a fan of the Coen's since I saw Blood Simple in the early 90's. But, I suspect that this is their best film. Yes, better than Fargo or Lebowski, both of which I loved. The first thing that makes it special is Anton Chigurh, played by Javier Bardem. He is certainly one of the most resourceful, remorseless and evil characters ever committed to celluloid, on a par with Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter. There is a conversation between him and a over-friendly gas station owner towards the beginning of the film thats up there with the most chilling scenes I've ever seen. And they're just talking.The supporting cast is of a very high caliber, Josh Brolin being a revelation and Tommy Lee Jones playing a role only he could have done justice to. Woody Harrelson has an excellent cameo role. He plays one of many unfortunate souls that cross paths with the deranged Chigurh and can only say ""you don't have to do this"". The way his face turns red, he knows he's going to die and the calm exhibited by the monstrous Chigurh will remain in my mind for a long, long time.The Coen's have always been strong on the technical aspects of film-making i.e. cinematography, sound, editing etc. but this is by far their best work. The action mostly takes place in motels and a dusty desert near the Mexican border where the drug deal went south. In both cases, the visuals are perfect. That is exactly how you would expect a motel to look and smell. That is the perfect secluded place in the desert to make a drug deal. Both locations/sets stick in the mind. The sound too is really important to this film and perfectly done without having a soundtrack. The editing is extremely taut in the few action scenes between Chigurh and Moss such as when Chigurh comes to visit him in motel #2. The tight editing really gives the action and suspense a greater punch.While there is much humor in the film, especially in Tommy Lee Jones's banter, you can't relax while watching this. It grips you from the first moment and you're on a horrifying nightmare journey that you hope is going to end well. But it isn't!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Wonderfully crafted and directed.,"No Country for Old Men (2007, Dir. Ethan Coen & Joel Coen)After stumbling across a case of money among dead bodies, Llewelyn Moss (Brolin) thinks he can keep it quiet, but when silent killer Anton Chigurh (Bardem) locates Moss and his money, Vietnam veteran Moss makes a run for it. With bodies falling everywhere Anton goes, it's only a matter of time before he catches up with Llewelyn. Whilst all this is going on, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Jones) is overseeing the investigation and begins to see the country in a different light than it once was.Wonderfully crafted and directed that 'No Country for Old Men' is one of the best films of 2007. Huge levels of drama and suspense builds up to a unexpected climax. Javier Bardem rightly deserved his Oscar win just for creating such an iconic and terrifying villain.Would you hold still, please, sir?  Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem)",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Masterpiece of Tension and Atmosphere,"No Country for Old Men is a film that manages to be both intense and understated at the same time. Directed by the Coen brothers, the movie is based on the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy and tells the story of a man named Llewelyn Moss (played by Josh Brolin) who stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and finds himself pursued by a ruthless hitman named Anton Chigurh (played by Javier Bardem). The film is a masterclass in tension and atmosphere, with every scene expertly crafted to keep the audience on the edge of their seat.One of the most impressive aspects of No Country for Old Men is its use of silence. The movie features long stretches of dialogue-free scenes, with the only sound being the wind blowing through the Texas landscape. This creates a sense of unease that permeates throughout the entire film, making the audience feel like something is just out of sight, waiting to pounce. The tension is further heightened by the exceptional performances from the cast, particularly Bardem, who is both terrifying and magnetic as the hitman Chigurh.The film's themes of fate and mortality are explored through the character of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (played by Tommy Lee Jones), who is tasked with tracking down Chigurh. Bell is a man who has seen too much violence in his life and is struggling to come to terms with the fact that he may be too old for this kind of work. Jones delivers a haunting performance that captures the weariness and resignation of a man who has seen the worst of humanity.No Country for Old Men is a film that demands your full attention. The slow-burn pace may not be to everyone's taste, but those who stick with it will be rewarded with a film that is both thought-provoking and thrilling. The Coen brothers' direction is impeccable, with every shot and every cut serving a purpose in building the tension. The film's shocking ending is a testament to the power of cinema and will stay with you long after the credits roll.Overall, No Country for Old Men is a masterpiece of tension and atmosphere. With its exceptional performances, masterful direction, and thought-provoking themes, it's a film that will leave a lasting impression on anyone who watches it. I would give No Country for Old Men a 9/10 rating and highly recommend it to fans of crime thrillers and thought-provoking cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good..but not that good.,"I came into this movie hearing lots of good things and that it was one of the best movies about, how I was disappointed. I think this movie is a good movie however it's not a great movie or one of the best ever, I think that movie had a good pacing, good acting, I just think that the story just seemed to be moving onto different subject and not staying on the one plot. I think that the off screen deaths of a few characters was a little frustrating and that we didn't know what happened with the main antagonist, speaking of the antagonist I thought that Javier Barden played it so well, one of the best aspects of the movie. In the end would I recommend? Yes, but only if you can follow a good story and not get confused what the story is really about.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A dismal tide of nihilism,"To call this film an elegy to a simpler, more civilized society, would be, well, too civilized. If you want a good in-depth analysis of the nihilistic message of this film, read this review: http://tinyurl.com/33eer8The time for this movie (and the recent book it was based on) was 30 years ago. Then, it would have been an insightful social commentary. Anyone paying attention to the world since that time has received the director's message loud and clear, over and over, just by watching or reading the news. It's clear that the world has become a more savage place, that individual efforts to resist the downward spiral are futile. To shoot at, stomp on, and rip up the bloody corpse of a civilized society is completely unnecessary and adds nothing to the conversation.As entertainment, the film fails, too. There are no real people in this film, only stock types: the naive, greedy, sap, the overmatched lawman, the unstoppable bad guy, the sensible western wife, the scummy Mexican jackals. There is no one to engage with, sympathize with, or be terrified of, because everyone in the movie is just a caricature. The CG character of Gollum in the Lord of the Rings had more substance than the hyperviolent hit man in this flick.As a result, crackerbarrel philosophy is passed off as sage insight, and cruel violence is passed off as a good time. At least Pulp Fiction, this movie's closest cousin, had wit and characterization. The fawning reception of this movie by critics and moviegoers angers and baffles me.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Unrealisitc and too Clever equal Lame,"Baloney! The usually entertaining Cohen brothers toss out reason and time frame history in order to add some thrill and detail to this film. In my opinion, the one and two star ratings here at IMDb contain the best reviews of this video. The acting was good.Aside from just how implausible this whole story is - factual tidbits added often don't follow the true time line of actual history. Many elements included are too rare to have been much seen in 1978.For example, there really wasn't much green hair or nose bones in 1978 Texas in spite of what the old boy in the film complains of. Additionally, ATM machines were few and far between in the big city let alone found in the Texas wastelands of '78. HBO in rural motels were a great amenity, but also very rare back in the 1970s as I recall.Those 1970s vehicles in the movie were cool to look at, but I don't remember one vehicle in the film that wasn't well preserved. I remember the roads of those days as being filled with many old early 1960s clunkers (and older autos) still cruising the roads by the late 1970s. In this film, all the vehicles are pristine (unless engulfed in fire).I won't even touch on the implausibility of the film's plot and narrative. Sorry, it's just not realistic for late 1970s Texas. Because of good acting I rate this film 3 stars.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Shades of ""Fargo"",set in the vast,dry plains of South Texas","The Coen Brothers' 1996 not-so-cult movie I just mentioned may not be a direct comparison(though,as I recall from just seeing it,it isn't TOO far from being one,to be honest)to this current offering from them.PArt-time big game hunter Llwelyn Moss(JOsh Brolin,bruising and bleeding away his cleaner,sexier image here)runs across a prairie filed where a drug deal has gone violently wrong and left what appears to be no survivors. Among the carnage there,he spots a briefcase loaded with $2 Million. Letting greed get the best of his better instincts,Llwelyn takes the case and makes with it,much to the chagrin of the angry drug lords who once possessed it and of particular interest to one Anton Shigurh(Javier Bardem,a vision of steady concentration and nightmarish violence and efficiency),a hired killer who seems to have gone completely rogue. On the trail of both are two completely different agendas: hired ""fixer"" Carson Wells(Woody Harrelson,in his most succinct performance in recent history)and local Sheriff Ed Tom Bell(Tommy Lee Jones,who should ready himself for another onslaught of major award noms,if not outright awards for this performance),an aging,world weary lawman with more sense than to chase this case,but too much guts to let it go. As Shigurh carves a violent swath of destruction through south Texas into Mexico,it becomes increasingly evident that the clean escape that Moss had planned with the money is becoming almost impossible and a much higher debt to pay than what's contained in the purloined case he's been keeping.With heart-breaking performances by Kelly MacDonald(as the confused and powerless wife of Llewelyn),Tess HArper and Beth Grant(As,respectively,the warm and caring but ultimately unable to help wife of the Sheriff and Llwelyn's opinionated and feisty mother-in-law)and a dialog and soundtrack that is spare yet hauntingly effective,this movie makes the very choice move of making sure that little or no backing sound highlights or underscores the violence(and there's plenty of it)that this movie provides. Off the top of my head,the main comparison that this movie has to Fargo is that in both,a less-than-physically agile but very sharp and incorruptible law enforcement officer(here,Jones,in FArgo,Frances McDormand)tracks vile,potentially vicious thugs(here,of course,Bardem;there,Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare)through a state that is full of rural,potentially unforgiving terrain(FArgo's Minnesota and North DAkota to Old Men's Texas). Adapted off Cormac McCArthy's best-seller,the Coen's have seemed to rediscover their ability to contract their more scattered,frenetic,tongue-in-cheek natural style(think Raising Arizona,The Hudsucker Proxy,The Big Lebowski and,to a lesser degree,Barton Fink)and brought it down to something almost poetic and hypnotic(think MIller's Crossing,a film I personally found lushly made but irritating and hard to engage in). This movie disturbs as well as it entertains,but I have a strong feeling that was the aim of the makers,and as such,they hit their target(no pun intended).",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Thought my rottweiler was scary looking until I saw them. Tommy Lee Jones, is as usual a joy to watch. Barry Corbin also gives a great short performances. At first I didn't even realize it was him. Once he spoke, of course I knew whom it was. He once again brings a supporting role to a level few can achieve. The first film I ever saw him in was "" Urban Cowboy"". Ever since my family has referred to him as ""Uncle Bob"". I have always like Woody. It's ironic he plays killers. His father is sitting in prison for murder.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Absolutely great for the first two thirds.,"The Coens definitely have made some of the best movies of the past two decades; I won't profess to be among their biggest fans, but it's hard to deny the likes of Fargo, Miller's Crossing and The Big Lebowski. After a dip in the form over the last few years, this film became hotly anticipated; often being touted as a 'return to form' for the Coen Brothers. Well, it is definitely a return to form and undoubtedly their best film so far this decade - but I do have to say that I'm somewhat surprised at all the praise this film has gotten. The film is based on a novel by Cormac McCarthy and focuses on Llewelyn Moss, a man who is lucky enough to stumble onto a drug deal gone wrong after following a wounded animal. He soon discovers a case containing $2 million left at the scene and does what any man would do; takes the case without reporting the crime. However, he is discovered by the sadistic and psychopathic Anton Chigurh who tracks him down by any means necessary; and he has no qualms about mercilessly murdering everyone who gets in, or around, his way.The tone of the film is very relaxed and this bodes well with the Southern setting. It's also a stark to contrast to the bulk of the plot; at its heart, No Country for Old Men is a chase movie and the Coens somehow managed to make the film relaxed and tense at the same time. Almost every supposed great film has some sort of point to make, and while this film does touch on a few; it's never very focused and to be honest left me wondering why they didn't discard any muted 'points' and stick with the thriller elements. The cast is great; it's really good to see a film that puts gritty looking actors in the leading roles and every performance is perfect - Javier Bardem is particularly great as the psychopathic killer. The film is really great for the first two thirds; the chase is thrilling, the characters are interesting and the dialogue will keep any viewer glued to the screen - but then the film takes a shocking twist and it really all goes downhill. I do like a good twist, and perhaps this one worked well in the book; but it certainly doesn't on the screen. It's a real shame too as everything about the film is working brilliantly right up until this point. Overall, this is certainly a good film; it's very well made and interesting...just a shame about the ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Coen Brother's back on top form.,"It's only the 2nd month of the year and already we have a film that can be assured of it's entry into the 'best films of the year' list that many critics will be marking up come the December of this year. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a great return to form for the Coen brothers after there recent and disappointing attempts at screwball comedy and remakes, UNTOLERABLE CRUELTY and THE LADYKILLERS respectively, and a superb masterful thriller. When hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles upon a bunch of corpses and a case of money containing $2m dollars which he subsequently takes, in the middle of the unforgiving Texas heartland, he enters into an unfortunate and harsh set of circumstances that sees him on the run from a shadowy and almost unstoppable hit-man Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem). At the same time closely followed on there trail is Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones, a world weary and wise lawmen on the verge of retirement, who is hoping to find Moss before those that want the money find him first. The Coen's steady and smooth direction provide scenes of intensity and scenes carried along by the actions of the characters on-screen, as there are many scenes not featuring any soundtrack at all, only natural sounds. The characters are superbly played, Lee Jones, is excellent in his role as Bell, his face reads of weariness with the world and at a loss to understand the ruthlessness of today's criminals. Brolin is excellent as Moss, the luckless anti-hero, a decent guy who has made the wrong choice and has to go on the run, and finally Bardem is simply the personification of unstoppable evil, as Chigurh, along with the offbeat deliberate Coen influenced bad haircut, he cuts through the American heartland, with his weapon of choice (an airgun used to kill cattle, killing anyone who crosses his path and offering them a chance to avoid fate by calling heads or tales on a coin toss (the scene in the gas station where Chigurh makes the owner call heads or tails, is brilliantly written). Overall its a superb return to form for the Coen brother's and has much in common with there previous films FARGO and BLOOD SIMPLE, and also reminded me of the hard boiled thrillers of the 70's such as THE GETAWAY and CHARLEY VARRICK, which in similar terms to NO COUNTRY...used the desert landscape as a sort of modern day western setting. Also Roger Deakin's excellent cinematography perfectly captures the mood and intensity of the landscape and deserves any awards it receives. Overall an amazing and unmissable film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?,"No Country for Old Men is possibly the most interesting, intense, and discussion worthy movie of the year. I can guarantee that everyone who sees this movie will be talking about it for the entire way home. There are so many elements of the movie that are up for interpretation and speculation that a definitive answer as to what it all really means will likely never be reached.This film is a brilliant mix of storytelling, violence, and, most of all, suspense. Spectacular performances are given by the entire cast, but most notably Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson, Tommy Lee Jones, and the menacingly dark Javier Bardem. I just cannot stress enough how great Bardem is in this movie. He makes his character, Anton Chigurh, the creepiest guy you can ever hope to see.No Country for Old Men follows the story of Llewelyn Moss (Brolin), a man who stumbles upon a murder scene and two million dollars in drug money, a sheriff (Jones) trying to find his purpose in life, and a bounty hunter (Bardem) doing what he does best. It may seem like Brolin's character is the hero in this movie, but the story really toys with your perception of good and evil.It's not likely that No Country's soundtrack will be winning any Oscars or Grammies any time soon, but it's one of my favorite elements of the film. There is no music to be spoken of. It is dead silent. The natural noises of every scene are all that you will hear. The silence helps to build tension and intensity in just about every scene. While most movies are absolutely silent only right before something major or unexpected is about to happen, this movie gives the viewer that feeling throughout.There is no question that No Country for Old Men is one of the best movies of 2007, but I think that it will quickly take its rightful place as a cinema classic. The Coen Brothers will likely be taking home their first Oscars since Fargo come February. Although I can certainly see how some people will leave the theater disliking this movie, due to its intense and stylized nature, I think that it is essential viewing for any movie lover. Besides, who knew that so much could hang in the balance of a coin toss?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Then the direction is just superb and the Cohen just absolutely shine with there skill in this film. The film looks very original and has it's own style to it. The acting is just amazing and is the best I have ever seen for long time and defiantly up for many awards. Javier Bardem gives the best performance of the year and my personnel favorite. Anton Chigurh is the best bad guy and is just terrifying and shocking to watch him do his job and his hobby. Josh Brolin who is already having a great year with already two other great films out(Grindhouse & American gangster) completely blows me away with hi performance. Kelly Macdonald who I have never really heard about until I heard about this movie does probably the best female role of the year so far and I hope she gets Oscar nom and be very happy if she gets the Oscar. Woody Harrelson is a actor I have always like and now after this movie I highly respect him and will probably not get any notice or any awards which I think he highly deserves. Tommy Lee Jones in his best movie and best performance will probably get the Oscar since its like the role kinda came with an Oscar and I wouldn't mind him winning it but I would like the other actors to win.

Unfortunately, it drags along in some places but by design.

"Sadistic, ultra-violent, very few redeeming features, like a finely-painted portrait of fecal matter","I disliked this immensely and I think it will appeal to people who've given up all sense of right and wrong. I'm an Aussie bloke, quite open to influences in movies and broadminded (I like Reservoir Dogs, even Pulp Fiction, Leon/Professional, Bourne movies) but I found this sick. It made me feel like I'd been abused. IMHO its a splatter movie, with sadistic touches done with callous fetishistic relish by the Coens, and IMHO illustrates a debased cinematic sense. Tommy Lee Jones is misused and is cast IMHO to pull in suckers like us who enjoy movies and remember other better roles he's done. It's a schizoid movie with story line of Tommy Lee Jones as an old fogy speaking Texas patois with other Texans in accents so thick that you need a chainsaw to cut to the meaning. That stream is worthwhile; I thought of Last Picture show, Paris Texas, Fargo etc. and a hundred other movies - derivative but OK. The other stream is some loathsome splatter movie, with surgically graphic blood, killing, sewing up of wounds, violence done by a psycho killer - like a mail order catalog of death, blood and viscera. And then it ends on a downer. If you're into splatter movies, if you like walking through and watching excrement and think of it as art or exciting then this is for you. If you think Columbine is exciting or an allegory for modern times and enjoy mass murder movies then this is for you. It reminded me of that loathsome 5 minutes in Pulp Fiction where the bondage perverts tie up Ving Rhames in their basement, but extended for more than 3/4 hour of screen time. If you're into movies that have a story and some art and allow you to leave the cinema not wanting to erase your memories of the garbage you've seen, then avoid this film.

I think a lot of it is coming from younger viewers who know little or nothing about Peckinpah.

Bang bang you're dead,"Although Josh Brolin, playing Llewelyn Moss, is ostensibly the star of the Cormac McCarthy story, his faultless performance is overshadowed by that of Javier Bardem - the ""hood"" Anton Chigurh.

Seemingly inhuman (other than the time he spares the life of an old petrol station owner on the toss of a coin) he radiates evilness.Set in Texas and on the Mexican border in 1980 the tale verges at times on the preposterous as a tangled web involving trailer trash opportunist, Moss, stumbles upon$2 million dollars as the result of a shoot out between rival Mexican gangs at the handover of a truck load of drugs. Instead of handing it into the police like any good boy would do he decides to keep it and there then follows an elaborate chase to get the money back, led by Bardem , The Mexican's hired hand. It is much complicated by the simultaneous tracking of Moss by, but the other Mexican gang, a Private detective/hit-man, Woody Harrelson, and a ""whatever"" Police Sheriff, the world and police force-weary Tommy Lee Jones who is nearing his retirement.In the middle of it all sits the vulnerable and utterly convincing wife of Moss played beautifully by Kelly MacDonald. What a repertoire she has - her range is astonishing and she is quickly becoming one of Scotland's greatest actresses ever.The title is in some aways a parody. It's difficult to reach old age in this racket and the deaths clock up on a regular basis. but also it represents the central theme of the movie which rotates around Thornton's imminent retirement and the memory of his father, also a copper, who died young (in his 40's).It is a movie about death and has strong ethical and moral undertones. Although he has little screen time it is Thornton who is, in reality, the central protagonist as it is he who bookends the action with his reflections on life and its meaning.The action is pretty grizzly but rarely gratuitous, as the Coen's have chosen to direct it lightly - no great epic cinematography, no music AT ALL - it's almost a Hollywood Dogme film and that adds greatly to its impact.Heavy-handed direction, big scores, florid cinematography; all would have turned the preposterousness of the tale into a preposterous movie. As it is, it succeeds effortlessly in being the movie the great mafia directors (Coppola, Mann, Scorsese) would die for. In the hands of Tarantino the film might have become a parody of the book.The Coen Brothers are very, very good filmmakers. This is a very, very good Coen Brothers film.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This film is philosophy,"I went to see ""No Country For Old Men"" because it is a Coen brothers film. I have seen the funny and bizarre side of the Coen brothers in ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"", ""Barton Fink"" and ""The Big Lebowsky"" and was curious about how they would present a real thriller. And ""No Country For Old Men"" turns out to be a hefty thriller movie. However, this film also has it's philosophical moments and makes you think. Indeed, there is one very central aspect of ""No Country For Old Men"" that might easily be forgotten amongst the suspense and the violence: this film is about the freedom of choice. And of course it gives the Coen brothers answer to a typical human dilemma... If you don't mind the violence: go and see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great Movie,"NCFOM is the best movie of 2007, and one of my favorites. It is as close to perfect as you can get, in other words, it is a masterful piece of work.When you watch NCFOM, pay attention to everything very closely, and you will see more than one story being told, and realize how good this film is. Javier Bardem brings an excellent villain to screen, it is the type of villain you remember for years to come. The rest of the cast was perfection as well. You just cant get any better than NCFOM. Everything is right on, and it is enough to just say, plain and simple, NCFOM is a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""A grim reminder that actions have consequences""","I am not going to 'blabber' on detailing the plot, that is what the plot outline is for.How good a film is, is a personal opinion. NCFOM in my opinion is mind-blowingly good. After watching it i felt really affected by what i had seen and didn't stop thinking about the film for hours afterwards.The character Anton Chigurh is one of, if not the best bad guy in a movie you will ever see. Spine-chillingly good. He is a grim reminder that actions have consequences, he is fate. Put it this way if he was after me, i would totally crap myself.Overall i think NCFOM is the best film of 2007 and probably one of the best films i have ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
