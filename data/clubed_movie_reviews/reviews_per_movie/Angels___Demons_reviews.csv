A Nutshell Review: Angels & Demons,"Tom Hanks returns as Dan Brown's symbologist Robert Langdon in his first adventure Angels & Demons, which Hollywood decided to make after The Da Vinci Code, given the latter's more controversial subject striking a raw nerve on the faith itself. The Catholic Church was up in arms over the first film, but seemingly nonchalant about this one. And it's not hard to see why, considering Ron Howard had opted to do a flat-out action piece that serves as a great tourism video of Rome and Vatican City, and would probably boost visitor numbers given the many beautiful on-location scenes, save for St Peter's Square and Basilica which was a scaled model used.So I guess with the bulk of the budget going toward the sets, the ensemble cast had to be correspondingly scaled down. Ayelet Zurer tried to step into the female void left by Audrey Tautou, but given Tautou's character then having a lot more stake in the film, Zurer's scientist Vittoria had a lot less to do other than just waiting in the wings to change some batteries on a canister filled with anti-matter. In the book she's the fodder of course for Langdon to converse his vast knowledge of the Vatican, the Illuminati and the great feud between the two, but here she's neither love interest, nor his intellectual equal.Ewan McGregor on the other hand, chews up each scene he's in as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, who is temporarily taking care of the Papal office while the other prominent cardinals are in the Sistine Chapel to elect a new Pope. And he plays Patrick with that glint in the eye, with nuances enough to let you know there's more than meets the eye. There's no surprises here for readers of the novel, but McGregor's performance here is one of the highlights of the film as Hanks plays well, Tom Hanks.The book itself is rich with arguably accurate content as always, and had a lot more plot points on science versus religion, and a wealth of information that Dan Brown researched and linked together in an engaging fictional piece of work. While reading the book some years ago, I thought that should a film be made of it, it's easy to lapse and dwell more on the set action pieces. Sadly, that's what this Ron Howard film did, with a pace that doesn't allow a temporary breather. Unlike the first film where you had the characters sit down for some ""discussion time"" over a cup of tea, this one moved things along so quickly, it's like reading the book all over again, page after page being skipped just to get to the thick of the action.Catholic reviewers have called Angels & Demons harmless, because I guess it didn't dwell on its many controversies, unlike The Da Vinci Code which struck a raw nerve at the centre of the faith. And if anything, this film served as a great tourism promotional video with a nice showcase of the many prominent touristy landmarks that would entice many around the world to go pay a visit. Naturally certain areas like the catacombs beneath St Peter's Basilica, and the Vatican archives remain out of bounds, but the walk along the Path of Illumination, now that's almost free.Nothing new for those who have read the book other than to see it come alive, but for those who haven't, this film may just compel you to pick up Dan Brown's novel just to read a bit more about the significance about the landmarks, and characters such as Galileo, Michelangelo and Bernini who are intricately linked to the plot, but much left unsaid. Satisfying pop-corn entertainment leaving you with nothing spectacular.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
worth watching but could have been done better,"This is an OK adaptation of the breath taking book of Dan Brown. I can't say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy. Given the excellent story, the result could have been better though. The movie is pretty long but at the end I was feeling like some things were missing. Sound effects and sound tracks were very good. Acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak. For people who didn't read the book, things may look happening too quickly. From my point of view, instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book, they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper. What makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of Vatican. You see neither of it in the movie. Too much rush and using the time not in a good way, these are main problems of the movie. So, it is worth watching but could have been done better.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Why are People Bashing this Movie?,"I go to the movies to be entertained. I was very entertained by the first film in this series: The DaVinci Code. It had plenty of twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested. Angels and Demons is no different. If you enjoyed the DaVinci Code, then you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie as well. Angels and Demons is made pretty much with the exact same style as the previous film, but faster paced, which I liked. Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bit.What I really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious, they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable. If there is one thing that I didn't like about this movie, it is that the plot itself is very unbelievable (don't want to give any spoilers). But hey, it's a movie. I was entertained throughout the whole thing and was very satisfied with what I saw.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Book>Movie,"I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago, and I can honestly say to is one of the few books that I couldn't put down while reading.The movie however was pretty much what i expected, a lot of action, with somewhat of a mystery storyline. Tom Hanks plays, in my opinion, a much better role, of Professor Langdon than in The Da Vinci Code.You won't have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code, this is everything that it wasn't. Much more interesting, more action, more suspense, and less of the unneeded controversy. If you haven't read the book, no worries you will still find it very interesting. And if you have read the book, well lets say you might be a little let down because I found many scenes missing that I was looking forward to.Overall, Pretty impressive film for any everyday movie goer. But, maybe not something too special for Dan Brown fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Despite its obvious flaws, A&D is surprisingly good.","Before seeing the sneak preview today of Angels & Demons, I cleared my mind of any uncertainties that might hold me back from enjoying it; the enormous amount of hatred towards Dan Brown, the fact that it was written by Dan Brown, and because Dan Brown's name is slapped on all of the posters. I went in with an open mind, and expected the worse, but instead what I got was a 2 and a half hour Roman cat and mouse game with Forrest Gump, and that is by all means good entertainment value.The movie hangs loosely on the actual novel itself. Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) jets off to Rome after the Pope's sudden death and the re-election through Papal Conclave. Arranging all of this is the carmelengo, Patrick McKenna (McGregor). However, he soon learns of a new threat, one that involves a secret brotherhood making its presence known, an anti-matter time bomb that Vatican City is now targeted with and the kidnapping of four cardinals. Langdon, using his intellects (and trust me, you'll be hearing a LOT from it) is given the task of finding and rescuing them using the mysterious Path of Illumination. Aiding him on the quest is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer), who is also the co-creator of the anti-matter.The movie itself runs at an uneven pace. One minute Langdon and the Swiss Guard are speeding to save a branded cardinal, the next minute he bores you with pointless information about every random object he passes, evidently slowing the book's much anticipated action/thriller sequences down. It makes for an interesting read on paper, but on screen it can go either way.The character's are decently written onto the big screen. Ewan McGregor does a convincing performance as the quiet but knowledgeable Patrick McKenna, famous accent included. Tom Hanks is slightly more agile, intellectually and physically, since his last performance in the mediocre Da Vinci Code. Stellen Skarsgard plays Commander Richter, the straight-faced leader of the Swiss Guard. Unfortunately, neither his nor Ayelet Zurer's performance are worthwhile ones, and instead of playing a part in the story, they are just kicked aside as assets.However, Angels & Demons accomplishes what DVC could never; a thrilling fast-paced movie filled with satisfying explosions, beautiful recreations of St. Peter's Square and Basilica (including many of the churches) and a pulsing bomb counting down the midnight hour. Ron Howard does a decent job at directing this second Langdon adventure, this time taking in much criticism and almost completely exchanging the boring dialogue for tense chases (almost).While newcomers might call it a ""National Treasure 3"" with a much larger threat, there is still enough contagious suspense/thriller eye-candy and brilliant still shots of Rome to breathe in. Fans of the book might feel differently towards the movies drastic changes, but considering the amount of blasphemy and inaccuracy it generates, A&D does exceedingly well at keeping the viewer locked on to the screen this time rather than on their sleepy shoulder.A good book-to-movie adaption that will both appeal and entertain.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.,"Where Da Vinci code introduced us to Dr. Robert Langdon and his knack for solving puzzles, Angels and Demons ups the ante by providing a huge puzzle with an 8 hour limit.With a cast of award winning actors, Ron Howard does a good job of directing a story that was easy to follow and even easier to accept. The Da Vinci code threw so many angles at you in such a short time that a quick bathroom break would leave you a bit confused on return. I didn't feel this was with Angels and Demons, the plot was straight-forward and the action kept the interest level peaked throughout.Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) was easily my favorite character in the movie. His portrayal of the elitist, yet misunderstood rank of the Catholic Church was very good and combined with the victim of his treatment Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), you will find yourself choosing sides immediately upon introduction. There isn't a great amount of Tom Hanks time as the film focuses more on story than character development and this did well with me being that I had more than enough introduction from the first movie.Unfortunately I found Ayelet Zurer's character Vittoria Vetra to be an unnecessary femme assistant in the quest since her lines were a bit limited and seemed much like an afterthought. She does play a key role in the beginning of things but she soon fades into the background of being Langdon's ""familiar"" more-so than a necessary partner.The plot is as such, one of the organizations that the Catholic Church wronged in the past (there have been quite a few) has sought revenge in a most artistic manner. Some men of the church are kidnapped and are set to be executed at specific times until an ultimate end to the church itself will happen. Dr. Robert Landon is brought in to help decipher the clues and teams up with the beautiful Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who witnessed a colleague die at the hands of the church's enemy.Music staying relevant and the cinematography beautiful, I could chime on about this menial things but what makes Angels and Demons absolutely work is it's conclusion. It was by far one of the most amazingly surprising endings I have seen in a movie and I was impressed at how off-guard I was when it hit me. Like anyone else I appreciate a great wrap-up and this movie wraps it up quite tight and drops a pretty bow on it. Needless to say I left the theater pleased at the movie in it's entirety.If you are religious and unsure if this movie will offend your Catholic principles. I can say that where The DaVinci code painted Catholicism as a shady cover-up group of sadists, Angels and Demons paints them with a much lighter brush. The church is shown as being a collective of good men who are made to suffer for the sins of evil and misguided men who wore their colors and even a few who have infiltrated their modern ranks.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Angels and Demons Premier in Rome! I was there!,"I was at the premier of the movie last night in Rome. I am not an expert in the book, however there are a great deal of changes from the book to the movie. The pacing of this movie is much faster than the Davinci code. Many things were trimmed otherwise this would be a 4 hour movie. Many things were also changed to give the movie a fast pace. I think what matters is the feel of the movie and that works well for Hanks, Brown and company.There are some things in the book that would appear very implausible in the movie form. I am not giving any spoilers, except to say the ending of the movie is handled in a slightly different way. How Leonardo Vetra was found is also different. Those who see the movie might be interested in reading the book to get the full details of the story. Some minor details are are also cut from the movie.Although they did film in Rome, they had to recreate interior shots. Since I went on a walking tour of Rome the day before the movie I can say that the interior sites are authentic in look and feel. Kohler is not in the movie and not much is shown about CERN. Hanks does a good job and there are some interesting scenes involving the Vatican archives. Of course they had no access to that area and I am not sure if anyone actually knows what the Vatican archives look like. Eyelet Zurer has her break in this movie as Victoria Vetra and does a good job as eye candy for Hanks.This movie should be received better by the critics and public, but you never know. Ron Howard mentioned several times in interviews and as we saw him and the cast before the movie, that this is just a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Slicker and more entertaining than Da Vinci,"Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called to Rome to help decipher the mystery behind the Illuminati before a new science experiment blows up the city.The Da Vinci Code broke records in 2006 but for the vast majority of Dan Brown followers it did not do his award winning book justice and though running at a good 2 and a half hours, seemed to bore many.Having read the book, I was perhaps one of the few who enjoyed Tom Hanks and Audrey Tautou attempt to solve the mystery of the murder in the Louvre but for Angels and Demons the scales were raised once more as lead star and director return.Having asked around, most people seem to prefer Angels and Demons to The Da Vinci code for an entertaining read and it seems as critiques and fans, whilst still not fully justified, prefer this latest adaptation to the 2006 release.This Howard picture certainly has a more clinical energy and exercise to it as unlike Da Vinci, Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon has only one night to solve the mysterious activities of the forgotten Illuminati in the Vatican and because of the time limitations, the action and desperation up the ante and deliver an excitement that certainly beats The Da Vinci code but also generates plenty of twists and stunning murder sequences.The interesting factor of this 2009 release is the constant elements being justified for the murders. Earth, wind, water and fire are all included in drastic and powerful sequences to pronounce a feeling of overall power to the situation.This really does justify the tag of thriller with a constant tension and sharp drama with the issues and beliefs once more given a full working over.Just like 3 years ago, there are many debates and discoveries of symbols once believed to be lost forever and Langdon is again the key character to show everyone the light in and amongst the controversy of other pressing circumstances.It is fair to say Dan Brown is a complex writer; he certainly likes to cram issues and dramas in amongst his action and thrilling sequences. As well as trying to discover the Illuminati, there is also the scenario of the election of a new pope, the dealings with a new scientific experiment and the power of Religion is again present. All interesting to discover and listen to, if occasionally the debates and dialogue tend to send your mind drifting but as there is so much in the novel, this was always likely.Ron Howard, who kept a frankly ordinary type of direction rolling in Da Vinci, returns in perhaps the worst way possible. His jerky ever moving camera styling does nothing to keep the pressure up, and we can never fully accept what is happening on screen thanks to this frankly awfully portrayed style. He is certainly no Paul Greengrass and this is by no means Bourne.Slick and stylized this is faster and more interesting than Da Vinci",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
More interesting than Da Vinci Code.,"Angels and Demons is not too bad, it comes in a form of entertainment. It is more intense than Da Vinci Code. I remembered that I had to pry my eyes open during the middle part of Da Vinci Code. It is long, not much suspense and consists of babbling about. Yawn. But Angels & Demons, the sequel, is more intense, has more suspense and action. Tom Hanks gets not only to exercise his brain but also his legs. The adventure requires him to move from one place to another.The story: Tom Hanks plays symbologist Robert Langdon. He has to solve a murder and at the same time, prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican. This time, he has Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to help him solve the mystery. The mystery plot and intense peril scenes kept me on the seat. Hans Zimmer's beautiful score makes the movie more epic. The adventure is an intense ride but not as intense as I thought. The sets are amazing too.Overall: Fans of the book will flock the cinemas to catch this. Fans of the previous movie, Da Vinci Code, should also catch this. Those who like thrillers, this one may suit. This is supposed to be a fictional thriller which is not to be taken seriously.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I wish I hadn't read the book,"I am sorry for all the readers, but I don't know where to begin.Let me say at first that I'm not a big Dan Brown fan, but I read Angels & Demons with great pleasure. The book deals a lot with the eternal question of Science vs. Religion and that made me think a lot about that subject again. That big battle is totally lost in the movie.A lot of the important lines in the book (CERN, Maximilian Kohler, the scepsis of the Swiss Guard, the love relationship between Robert and Vittoria, the Hassassin, the relationship between the Camerlengo and the pope) are lost in the movie screenplay. This makes the movie a very cut-down and over-simplified version.Would the movie be any good if I hadn't read the book? I still doubt it. From scene 3 on, the movie is a 'chase-movie' without interruption. There is no time for contemplation or depth. No story-line, no backgrounds. It's just a chase movie in a GREAT decorum.You would think that with a running time of about 140 minutes a movie is able to bring more. Much more.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Vatican Murder Mystery,"Let's get one thing straight: The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, as written by Dan Brown, are both books that are best described as ""airplane literature"", i.e. stuff that one can read cover-to-cover while on a plane, train or something without assuming said tome is going to leave anything meaningful once the reading is over. The film version of The Da Vinci Code, while certainly not the best summer blockbuster of 2006 (Mission:Impossible III, X- Men: The Last Stand and Superman Returns were much smarter and more memorable), was an enjoyable piece of work because director Ron Howard, screenwriter Akiva Goldsman and star Tom Hanks got it right: the story is deliberately provocative (in a bad way) and slightly pretentious, but as a slick, well-executed thriller it works quite reasonably. The trio (with the addition of David Koepp in the writer's chair following the WGA strike) returns with Angels & Demons, and the results are, sadly, less thrilling than expected.Once again, Europe and religion are involved: the story unfolds in Rome and the Vatican, with two brief detours in Geneva and Massachussetts. The story is the following: someone has stolen a canister of anti-matter from CERN in Geneva and killed the scientist who was working on it. Said scientist's assistant, Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer, aka Eric Bana's wife in Munich), is summoned to the Vatican, where the College of Cardinals is organizing the conclave so that a new Pope can be elected. Unfortunately, the same someone who stole the anti-matter is also responsible for the disappearance of four Cardinals, who will be killed between 8 and 11 p.m., after which the canister will be used to blow up the Vatican (yes, it's silly as hell, but who cares so far?). Since it would seem that the Catholic Church's oldest enemy, the Illuminati, a sect that favors science over religion, are behind the whole thing, the Camerlengo (the Pope's most trusted man), Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), reluctantly asks Robert Langdon (Hanks) for help, since the latter's extensive knowledge of the Illuminati's methods and traditions could prove useful in the race against the clock that lies ahead.Setting aside possible chronology issues (the book is a prequel, whereas the movie is a sequel, reflecting the fact that most people discovered Angels & Demons after reading The Da Vinci Code first), the film sticks to the previous entry's blueprint: running from one location to another, clues hidden in works of art, Langdon explaining things, potentially controversial revelations (although the novel's main twist has been removed). It should work, right? And yet Angels & Demons struggles when it comes to delivering thrills and excitement, even if the key set-pieces - one involving the Vatican archives, the other a helicopter - are admittedly spectacular. The main reason the film is less efficient as a thriller lies in the excess of exposition: too much is revealed too quickly, courtesy of some very long conversations between Langdon and, alternatively, Victoria, a Roman police officer (Pierfrancesco Favino) and two unhelpful Swiss guards (who are played, funnily enough, by Scandinavian actors).The cast is another problem: Hanks is never boring (and he's cut his hair since last time, meaning he looks less laughable), and the support he gets from Favino, Stellan Skarsgard (whose part was extended compared to the book) and Armin Mueller-Stahl (always a good choice, no matter the film) is pretty solid, but Zurer is so bland she even makes Audrey Tautou's much derided final scene in The Da Vinci Code look good: not only is her chemistry with Hanks close to zero, she also has the ungrateful job of sounding convincing when she delivers lines in Italian (the character, of course, was born in Italy; the actress, on the other hand, is from Israel, and it shows). McGregor also has some difficulty conveying the apparent solemnity of his part, but at least they changed the Camerlengo from Italian to Irish to avoid accent problems. And, quite frankly, replacing Paul Bettany's Silas with a textbook hit-man doesn't help much either.Any good bits, then? Well, the locations - all studio-built, given the Vatican's policy of never allowing any filming on its territory - are a superb piece of eye-candy, and amidst the clumsy exposition there are a few intriguing (but largely inaccurate, apparently) anecdotes regarding a bunch of famous people that should appeal to art aficionados. That's pretty much all Angels & Demons has to offer: it isn't exactly not entertaining (the aforementioned set-pieces and some witticisms coming from Hanks make sure real boredom never ensues), but the beautiful production design can't hide some pretty serious storytelling issues (since when does someone who analyzes ancient texts for a living need help with Latin inscriptions?). Then again, no one ever expected the film to change their views on the religion vs. science debate, right?",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"True to his word, Ron Howard has definitely topped Da Vinci Code","Can Robert Langdon save the Catholic Church and prevent Vatican City from destruction? The race is on as Ron Howard's multi-million dollar blockbuster sequel finally hits the big screen. We last saw Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) 3 years ago, when he uncovered the truth behind a secret society. Now, he's called on once again. This time the stakes are higher, the case is deadlier and the mystery is unlike anything he's witnessed. Here, he's called to Rome to study a mysterious death of one of the 4 cardinals. Little does he know that he's tangled up in a war between the Catholic Church and a Secret Society known as the Illuminati (the enemy to the Catholic Church.) He soon learns that a member of Illuminati has kidnapped 3 other cardinals, threatening to kill one an hour and seizing to destroy Vatican City when the conclave begins. There on he goes on the hunt with a brilliant Scientist (Ayelet Zurer) followed by mysterious twists, turns and deaths headed their way. The only question is can they stop the attack in time? Ron Howard's Angels and Demons is better than his first outing (Da Vinci Code) in every single way possible. It's better in terms of quality, story, and entertainment. The suspense started very early (unlike the slow moving Da Vinci Code) and has enough action and great shots of the Vatican to keep you in your seat for at least 2 hours. Think of it as National Treasure meets 24 in Rome. Despite its potential, it also does has some flaws. It's still preachy, preposterous, and somewhat predictable. Did I mention it also felt like it went on for longer than it needed to be? If you're an open minded person, and often use ""That can never happen"" then you then you may want to take this one off your alley. For those who want mindless and heart pounding entertainment, this is a neatly crafted action thriller, with twists and turns headed every direction. Be sure to take a chill pill after this film is done because it was really that suspenseful. The supporting cast including the very underrated Ewan McGregor and Stellan Skarsgård all had deserving roles, and it was neat to see Ewan back on the screen (he's been gone far too long.) Bottom line, though it can't compare with the book, it's still terrific entertainment, and if you liked Da Vinci Code, Ron Howard has a big surprise for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Religion Is Flawed Because Man Is Flawed,"After the death of the Pope, the conclave has gathered in a locked room to choose his successor among four cardinals named ""preferitti""; however the quartet is abducted in a revenge of the Illuminati, a secret brotherhood that was supposed extinct. The symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and the scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), who had her powerful and dangerous prototype of antimatter research stolen, are invited by the Vatican police to help them in their investigation. They are received by the receptive Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) and by the reluctant Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård) and are informed that the Illuminati have promised to kill each cardinal every hour from 8:00 PM and then explode the Vatican City with the antimatter. Robert and Vittoria have a few hours to unravel the clues and discover where the lethal weapon might be hidden.The novel and bestseller ""The Da Vinci Code"" of Dan Brown was one of the most intriguing books that I have read. I was curious about the adaptation to the cinema of that complex and detailed story, and I found it only reasonable and the movie frustrated my expectations. I have not read ""Angels & Demons"", and I liked very much this film. The story has many plot points in wonderful locations; the acting is excellent and holds the attention until the last sequence.

Congratulations to Ron Howard!,"No doubt Ron Howard is the great hero of this movie and has proved to be a truly professional and skilled director: he has perfectly understood the nature of Dan Brown's novel and the aim of the production, thus being the result a well-focused, well made and well performed product that will certainly be a top box-office movie.Dan Brown wrote this impressive thriller, made of action, suspense, paradoxical and surprising twists, with the aim of selling. Ron Howard spares no effort and succeeds in rendering the same thrilling and engaging story, based on a well consolidated narrative outline, where we find the trustworthy hero, Robert Langdon, capable of unraveling every mysterious sign and leading us to a shocking finale. Everything, of course, sounds too excessive, there is a crescendo of excess, at the limit of ridiculous, but what is worth underlining is the typical capability of Hollywood great productions to take their job very seriously, and to make a good product out of nothing, being both them and the viewer conscious of the real nature of what is being displayed. What counts is that the final result is an aesthetically good and entertaining movie: and it is, indeed.Evidently, the movie, like the book, represents no threat to the unbreakable solidness of the Roman Catholic Church, and even less to the faith of real faithful people. The fears and reluctance of clerical authorities when the movie was distributed, sounded a little excessive, too (and indeed, in the end even L'Osservatore Romano gave it a favourable review). It is not even a thought-provoking movie, at least it offers no new or interesting perspective: the ancient, and let's admit, quite old-fashioned (but probably not so out of fashion) dichotomy between science and religion, is just a pretext on which to build a strong and till the end entertaining story, still able to attract millions of viewers all over the world: all the remaining nonsense is forgivable.The whole cast prove good performances, Tom Hanks is a certainty from the beginning, being however in my opinion Ewan Macgregor (the Camerlengo) the most interesting character, and the one with whom Langdon has the only interesting exchange on faith, but all actors (even ""our"" Pierfrancesco Favino) contribute to the enthralling atmosphere of the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
More angelic than demonic,"The Da Vinci Code movie was received with a mixture of enthusiasm and disappointment when it first arrived. The fans of the book couldn't wait for it, the Catholic church were going mad about it being released, and the average person was being shepherded to see a movie that they just wanted to know what all the media attention was about. I'll be the first to put my hands up and admit I was looking forward to it. I loved the book and wanted to see a great adaptation. I admit I enjoyed the movie, though a lot really didn't, but I will admit its slow moving, a bit tedious and way, way too faithful to the book. However I had read Dan Brown's other Langdon novel before Da Vinci Code, and I always found Angels and Demons the far superior story. And so here is the inevitable adaptation, and much like the books I prefer Angels and Demons. Demons is a fast paced, beautifully shot and brilliantly acted piece of popcorn entertainment. Yes it has its flaws, the story is still a bit all over the place, and various changes from the novel are not very welcome in my eyes. But for the most part this is a piece of superior entertainment, and after the disaster of Wolverine it is nice to see a sequel with a bit of thought behind it.So onto the acting. First off is Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon. First things first, the hair has been improved, I know that was a huge distraction for a lot of people in its predecessor. Hanks is pretty good here, I'm not going to lie and say he's incredible, as sadly Langdon isn't the greatest character ever. His motivations are vague at best. Still for the material he is given he makes the most of it. Ewan McGregor gets a great role in this movie, he was always the character that intrigued me most in the novel and McGregor does him justice. I won't spoil about him, but you understand after the halfway mark why such a famous actor was cast in the seemingly unimportant role. Ayelet Zurer does a great job as Vittoria Vetra, but the lack of screen time she gets in comparison to how much she is in the book really did frustrate me. Stellan Skarsgård is a bit wasted and I'm not too sure why he signed on for it all. Armin Mueller-Stahl is my personal favourite, have never really encountered the actor before, but his performance definitely is a highlight.The key to Angels and Demons superiority is in the pacing. Da Vinci Code had very sluggish moments and too many endings for its own good. Here the movie is set over a night, and it works all the better for it. The plot zips along, and all the talky dialogue is usually done while driving or running to the next location to prevent a murder. The murders themselves are shot superbly, although the Air murder is nowhere near as gory as depicted in the novel. The Fire and Water murders are superb though. I liked the execution of the twist for the most part, and I don't think it was as blatantly obvious as I feared, considering it completely threw me when I read the book. The helicopter bit from the novel however is still ludicrous, and the whole antimatter scenario is a OTT for its own good. But these are the flaws of the novel, and at least the ridiculous divine intervention garbage has been scrapped.Overall Angels and Demons is a fun thrill ride for the summer. Its a superior movie to Da Vinci Code, and I just hope The Lost Symbol (the upcoming Dan Brown novel) is good enough to warrant Ron Howard and Tom Hanks to sign on for yet another one.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant suspense thriller with some spectacular photography...,"Personally, I enjoyed ANGELS AND DEMONS much more than the DA VINCI CODE. It moves at a quick pace, never becomes boring despite the bits of exposition needed to explain the plot, and is accompanied by another good Hans Zimmer score that accentuates the suspense at every turn.The plot is much more straightforward and easier to follow than the previous Dan Brown story, although the clues seem a bit hard to swallow for the average man. In this, we trust the screenwriter that a man such as TOM HANKS plays would be able to pick up on all these facets of the church to know what he's doing and where he must turn next.The assassin played by NIKOLAJ LIE KAAS does a superb job of keeping the sinister aspect of the Illuminati plot chilling enough to keep you glued to your seat. He's highly believable in a pivotal role even though his motivations are never quite clear. EWAN McGREGOR does a fine job as Camerlengo and his participation in the film's final twist is handled with style by director Ron Howard and his screenwriter.AYELET ZURER is much better at portraying Tom Hanks' assistant in solving the mystery than the woman in the previous film, her accent not as thick as the French actress which was a huge drawback in THE DA VINCI CODE. Others in the cast do commendable work, but it's the whole look and style of the production that fascinates from beginning to end.The photography is outstanding in its recreation of the Vatican artwork, the night scenes through the streets are done with great flair, and the story builds in intensity toward a very smashing climax.It's a lot less offensive in dealing with the Catholic Church than the previous work was, using the Illuminati only to provide a chilling current tale of corruption and deception. It works beautifully.One of the best action thrillers of the year, highly entertaining and full of gripping suspense.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Swing and a miss,"I should have known you can't teach an old dog new tricks. Religion, science, worlds end, moment of creation, ancient secret societies... Ron Howard stays faithful to his cues, but ultimately the downfall of this movie lies solely in plot and writing. Today, audiences can suspend disbelief if they go into a theater with such intention, but that was the magic behind The Da Vinci Code, wasn't it? We walked out of the theater with a sense of ""what if?"" despite having been ready for a movie that was supposed to be unbelievable. Angels and Demons fails on this note because the plot is childish and absurd, in no way a justice to its paperback counterpart. It seemed rushed, despite being too long, and many a minute were wasted on meaningless dialog that could have otherwise been used to develop characters whose interactions were arbitrary, to say the least. There is, though ill-fated, an attempt made for a Langdon/Sophie relationship here... which in itself was just pathetically copycat material. And to make matters worse, characters who exist long enough and seem to finally be taking a decisive role suddenly are either killed or shooed away for more haywire plot development. And when I say haywire, I mean insanely over-the-top ridiculousness. It's sporadic and even a bit desperate to capture the essence its predecessor left behind, and in the end it just doesn't compare. Wait for the DVD folks.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"""Open the doors, and tell the world the truth""","Robert Langdon is back and better than ever – and, by better, I mean that he finally got himself a haircut. In 2006, Ron Howard's 'The Da Vinci Code' was released amid a storm of controversy, snagged $750 million at the box-office, and suffered a crucifixion at the hands of critics worldwide. I remember the film well because it inspired me for the first time to discuss, at length, a film's merits – I was, for better or worse, Howard's most ardent defender. Howard's follow-up 'Angels and Demons' (adapted as a sequel) opened with only a polite smattering of debate, and is all the better for it. Now both films can comfortably be enjoyed for exactly what they are – entertaining pulp thrillers, replete with exotic locations, beautiful women, brutal murders, ancient conspiracies, treasure hunts, and a race against time. Owing to the source novel's more limited reputation, 'Angels and Demons' lacks the bloated self-importance, whether conscious or not, of its predecessor, and so can be enjoyed, without reservation, as a fanciful, unpretentious two-hour page-turner.Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have shorn the majority of Dan Brown's ludicrous plot twists – most fortunately a parachute- substitute that would have sent audience eyes rolling – but, even so, the film remains thematically inconsistent, a flaw that extends back to the source material. When Brown originally published ""Angels and Demons"" in 2000, he was at the cross-roads of a transition in his writing style. ""Digital Fortress"" and ""Deception Point"" were pretty straightforward conspiracy thrillers, with government organisations using ultra-modern technology to perpetrate their crimes and threaten the truth-seeking heroine. By ""The Da Vinci Code (2003),"" all elements of science-fiction had been discarded in favour of historical documents and religious iconography. But ""Angels and Demons"" finds itself stranded in the middle of this conversion, labouring extensively over fictional antimatter explosions when a simple bomb would have done just nicely. This juxtaposition of history and technology may well have been intentional, used to emphasise the conflict of science and religion, but there is nonetheless an imbalance of tone that jars violently with the viewer.Tom Hanks reprises his role as Harvard ""symbologist"" Dr. Robert Langdon, and his performance is an improvement. Rather than existing purely as a cypher of ancient symbols, Langdon seems to have developed a fuller persona, though there's some awkward, sitting-on-the-fence attempts at defining his stance on religion. The supporting players – Ewan McGregor, Aylet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgård, Pierfrancesco Favino – are dependable without attempting to steal the limelight, as Ian McKellen did so successfully in 'The Da Vinci Code.' Only Nikolaj Lie Kaas, as the Illuminati assassin, doesn't quite feel the part, lacking the ghostly creepiness of Paul Bettany in the equivalent role. Salvatore Totino's cinematography isn't the most handsome you'll see this year, but nevertheless captures the art and architecture of Rome and the Vatican (whether real or recreated) with stunning vibrancy. Hans Zimmer's score is energetic and emphatic at the right moments, not only underscoring events in the film but forcefully stamping their significance. All flaws aside, I can certainly see future generations enjoying 'Angels and Demons' for its preposterous sense of fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The best of the Robert Langdon movie trilogy...,"I'd heard the hype surrounding The Da Vinci Code movie, never read the book, never saw it at the theatre, eventually hired it on DVD (remember hiring DVDs?) and...was pretty bored by it. I've come around to not-minding it on subsequent viewings when it's been repeated numerous times on TV, but I much prefer this second film. I saw this one at the theatre, hadn't read the book...which I think helped me enjoy the movie, as I felt this one was the most interesting/had the best pacing and actually felt like a proper movie mystery/thriller. It's my favourite of the trilogy and the one I've rewatched the most. I think, as a whole, Angels & Demons is just a better-told film. It isn't slow-paced/plodding along with a drawn-out conclusion like The Da Vinci Code was. Although Ron Howard directed all three films in the trilogy, *this* is the one that kept me interested throughout (even during the 'slower' moments). Tom Hanks seems more at ease in his role as Robert Langdon this time around; his likeability ensuring the audience *cares* what happens to him, and his delivery of exposition (of which there is quite a lot) thankfully didn't ever really bore me. I never saw what the big deal was about his hair in the first film, but any who feared that his 'do would be the 'demon' from the title of this film needn't fear, as it's shorter now.The biggest improvement with this film over its predecessor, I thought, was Langdon's female partner he's paired with this time around. As the intelligent and beautiful Vittoria Vetra (who I found much more interesting than Audrey Tautou's Sophie Neveu from the first film), Ayelet Zurer is more of an 'equal' to Hanks's Langdon. They make quite the team, and Vittoria proves that she can indeed keep up with him (which is especially impressive since, as I heard Tom Hanks himself say during a radio interview when the film was being released, 'like every beautiful particle physicist...she wears Manolo Blahniks whilst running on cobblestone'). It's a bit of a shame, however, that unlike the beginning and end of the film, the middle is spent with her character and Langdon separated. After enjoying the two of them onscreen together so much at the start of the movie, I was disappointed they split up for what felt like quite a long period of time midway through. The actors have a nice chemistry, there's an ease/comfortableness between them, and I was amused during one scene that showed Vittoria's much more blunt/direct approach to getting what they needed as quickly as possible and Langdon's reaction to it. The two of them also obviously got a lot of exercise during filming, given all the running around that's involved.Ewan McGregor is another actor who brings an instant likeability to his character, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, and I think the movie benefited from this considering the direction in which the film goes with him. It's important we *like* him. McGregor really owned the last third of the film with his performance, I felt. While there are other somewhat important characters in the movie, I felt these main three were the most memorable. Unfortunately, I wasn't as interested in this movie's bad guy; The Assassin (because *all* of these movies HAVE to have one of those, apparently). Nikolaj Lie Kaas wasn't as intriguing a villain as Paul Bettany's albino monk, Silas, was in the first film (though at least this assassin gives a *reason* for not killing Langdon, despite having several chances to do so, rather than it just being because he's the lead and therefore has plot armour/can't die). Stellan Skarsgård (who I like in some films, but not others) wasn't overly likable here either. Much better were the characters of Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Chartrand (Thure Lindhardt, who it was fun to notice in this movie after having seen him years later in Seasons 3 & 4 of the TV series Bron/Broen aka The Bridge). His character shares quite a memorably tense scene with Langdon at one point and Lindhardt ensures that his character makes an impact despite limited screentime.This movie has a sense of humour that the first film didn't, but it's certainly not a laugh riot either, as there are several instances of gruesomeness, thus making it a far more intense film than the first. Hans Zimmer's score helps sell the suspense. The FX used in this movie illustrate the way CGI *should* be used (to help *add* to the film, rather than distract from it). The climax of the movie isn't quite what you might be expecting, as there's more to the story than first appears, and so long as you don't have a problem with reading subtitles, you should enjoy this film. Angels & Demons doesn't take itself too seriously (which is a plus, given the far-fetched circumstances) and is never dull. Apart from finally finding out just what exactly ""anti-matter"" is, the other thing I learned from this film was that being a Symbologist wouldn't be so bad a job, especially when you get to hang with a beautiful enigmatic Italian scientist. If only it were actually a job!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I liked the DaVinci Code better....,"The DaVinci code was more of a mystery, this was a thriller (there is a difference). The Da Vinci code had more history and more facts to play with, A&D is more fiction from the get go. I liked how in the Davinci Code aspects of the storyline were re-enacted such as the Knights Templar and Isaac Newton's funeral. A&D uses no reenactments.It was a good thriller, really, and I enjoyed every minute, but it just wasn't as good as the Davinci code in my opinion. It would help if you have been to Rome, are familiar with Italian art and architecture (from the late Roman period to the late Renaissance will suffice), and it wouldn't hurt if you were Catholic as well...Otherwise, I have to say that for 50ish, Tom Hanks has a pretty good bod, and his sidekick is the spitting image of Nigela Lawson - I kept expecting her to look into the camera and describe what she wanted for lunch in sensuous adjectives.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Way better than Da Vinci!!,"First i gotta say that this film is way less pretentious than The Da Vinci Code. sure, you have the religion vs science problem but it doesn't try to make a big statement about it. its basically an action thriller that moves from one scene to another very well. one scene particularly (that involves fire) i found extremely well done.Second, the changes from book to film. although when i was following the development of the film i complained about the change of some characters and the complete removal of others, i gotta admit i was wrong. it was refreshing that the film didn't follow the book in exactly the same way like it was done in Da Vinci. if you are a purist of the book some of them may upset you though. However the BIG TWIST is still there so don't worry about that. finally i'm glad they removed some silly sub-plots and didn't even try to hint at the possibility of Langdon and Vittoria getting together.The performances are really good, but nothing out of the ordinary. that's okay for a film like this.i'd give it a 9/10, mainly because it delivers what it promises, entertainment, pure entertainment",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
More streamline but  still not as clever as the book,"It is the mark of a truly talented director to smoothly flow between Oscar nominated dramas and big budget summer blockbusters, as is it to take the criticisms of a previous franchise instalment and buff and polish the sequel into a superior, smoother film. That is precisely what director Ron Howard does with the second Dan Brown adaptation Angels & Demons, cleverly folding what would be bloated subplots and somewhat ridiculous chapters into a more streamline narrative; mostly loyal but cleverly translated.Howard re-unites with Tom Hanks, who again stars as symbologist Robert Langdon. A prequel to the mega-hit The Da Vinci code on paper but interpreted as a sequel on film Angels & Demons progresses more quickly, talks less, features some solid supporting performances and has a spectacular final, effects-driven climax. Alas, even with most of the right moves and even more genuine intention Howard's film is simply not as good as the book, neither in cleverness or pacing. In the novel, Langdon's revelations are able to be drawn out and incorporate far more clues and twists and turns. Moreover, the much loved science vs. religion dispute is far better utilized as are the dark history of Rome and the origins and intentions of the secret society of the Illuminati which is the true spine of the story.Scooped up by the Vatican late one evening and jetted off to The Vatican, Robert Langdon again finds himself in danger adjacent to history, religion and ancient lore. Following the death of The Pope, and the subsequent induction of the next, an old threat rears its head once again. The ancient society of The Illuminati has come for revenge after centuries of suppression and secret annihilation at the hands of the church. Marring the ancient tradition of papal election is the kidnapping of the four preferiti (the cardinals most favoured to success the late Pope) and a bomb threat which could boast a devastating end to Vatican City. Langdon follows the ancient clues of the Illuminati along with a lovely scientist (Ayelet Zurer) who created the bomb which now threatens them all, Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) and Camerlengo McKenna (an excellent Ewan McGregor) the Pope's temporary successor and adopted son. Time runs out as Langdon and his team race to recover the four Cardinals held by a deadly Illuminati assassin (who if I may say is completely badass) and ultimately the bomb.Aside from the understandable nuances lost in the adaptation, a number of climatic elements were dropped that I found somewhat disappointing. I will not reveal them here, but if you are a fan you will pick them out easily. Thankfully though this will serve as no detriment to those not experienced with the Dan Brown's works and should still unfold as a satisfying finale. Technically, Angels & Demons is impeccable as are the shots of Rome and The Vatican. Howard's choice to assemble an international cast and not concern himself with cramming countless A list stars into the production is admirable and ultimately an asset. Hanks is adequate but is overshadowed by McGregor but helps the cast round out nicely in the end. This will not likely be the last we will see of Robert Langdon and here is hoping Howard et al can one-up themselves again and cap off an entertaining, if uneven, mystery trilogy.Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Solid Thriller,"While ""Angels & Demons"" is by no means a great film, it at least manages to be consistently solid, which places it head and tails above its sorry predecessor.From its mildly creepy opening to its mildly exciting finish, ""Angels"" is a fairly effective thriller. The plot bears quite a few similarities to that of ""Da Vinci,"" especially concerning the supporting characters, but it does introduce a strong device not present in the first film. Each stop on Robert Langdon's journey through Rome works as an excellent set-piece. Director Howard seems with these scenes to have a good feel for eerie suspense and gruesome reveals. Furthermore, once these set-pieces are all over, the plot takes on a whole new heart-pounding direction that lasts until the fitting, if slightly underwhelming, climax.Thusly, the plot proceeds from first frame to last, following for the most part the footsteps of Professor Langdon, played pretentiously yet again by Tom Hanks. It seems that to be a Harvard professor one must be bitterly sarcastic with everyone and deliver dragging monologues about history that long overstay their welcome. In fact, according to ""Angels & Demons,"" the same can be said of Camerlengos. Ewan McGregor plays the film's Camerlengo all too convincingly, pouring out endless dull speeches about the nature of faith and of mankind. The fault in this case lies wholly in the hands of the screenplay. Strangely enough, however, this same screenplay gives very few words to Vittoria Vetra, the apparent female lead, who is played inoffensively by Ms. Zuret. Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl fortunately fare better in their roles.Despite its shortcomings in some areas, the cast delivers on the whole, leading one to wonder why the film isn't better than it is. The real culprit here, in a twist worthy of a Dan Brown novel, is the screenplay. The movie drags on for an seat-squirming 138 minutes, matching each inspired thrill with a heavy-handed monologue or a piece of unnecessary historical jargon. Beautiful shots cannot beat bad pacing in this case. In fact, forty minutes of this film could be scraped away to great effect. Sadly, the said forty minutes were not cut, and this film is what it is. It's not bad, but it's no masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Pretty Good Action Film,"As is the case with many films of this ilk, my non Catholicism got in the way of my understanding it. The church has this mass of rules which have been put together over centuries. We have a short time to learn them and have to accept them at face value. Then, throw in some bad guys getting revenge for a long distant act against them, working under these rules and attempting to circumvent them, and you have this book and movie. I found myself thinking, ""That's pretty cool. Why did they do that?"" There's this casual thing in the Robert Langdon character where no matter what the issue, he seems to always make the right first move. I suppose it's like watching CSI where they solve incredibly complex cases in a matter of days. They know the lay of the land. In this film, there is so much land and so little time to really understand everything that is going on. But if you create Robert Langdon, you need to set him to work. That's OK because heroic nerds like him have been saving the day forever. I thought the film was fun. I thought the Da Vinci Code was fun too. Interesting and not as bad as people seemed to think.

Good adaptation of the novel.,"Angels & Demons has partially lived up to the expectations and hype that it has created among the movie going community in last one year's time. It started on a high note and maintained the pace well enough to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat, till the last 20 minutes. Director Ron Howard missed it in the last 20 minutes and you have that odd after-taste once the movie is finished.The movie started with the death of the Pope and is followed by the theft of a canister containing Anti-matter. From there, a Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon takes over. The story is well written by Dan Brown, which never lost the attention of the reader in its novel form. Akiva Goldsman did a fine job in adapting the story as a screenplay. There was enough of wit thrown in extremely fast paced story making sure that you will not get bored.The good point that is to be noted is Ron Howard has learned from his past mistakes of adapting the Dan Brown novels. Davinci Code was a slow paced movie and it really never kept the viewer riveted to the plot. Also, in trying to stick to the novel, it made fun of itself at points. But, Angels & Demons has lot of deviations from the original novel which resulted in a better movie. Actually, Davinci Code was a failure as a movie. You will enjoy the movie only if you have already read the book. But, A&D can be enjoyed by people who haven't read the book also.Vettoria Vetra was one thing I hated in the movie. The actress who did that role is relatively unknown and as expected, Ayelet Zurer could not make her presence felt anywhere in the movie.

I had an adequate time watching Angels and Demons,"In the interest of full disclosure, I fell asleep during some of the more talky scenes in the beginning but I awoke enough when the first chase came on. So with that said, this probably wasn't one of the most exciting movies I've seen this year though it did get better as the movie went on. Tom Hanks is fine reprising his role he previously did in The DaVinci Code though it's Ewan McGregor as a priest that was the most compelling part here. Ayelet Zurer as the leading lady was adequate here but she wasn't bad as adequate parts go. Ron Howard provides his own compelling direction to the fore though, like I said, it didn't completely jell for me.

perfect entertainment from a vastly superior sequel,"So first things first..Angels and Demons is a much better and very different film than the Da- Vinci code.Following the recent slew of comic book movies, remakes and questionable resurrections of aged franchises. it is refreshing to watch a very solid and entertaining film that is devoid of shaky cam filming techniques, lens flare, excessive GCI and over the top action sequences.In this respect Angels and Demons almost feels old fashioned.It offers a good and considered debate on the age old subject of religion Vs science, offers an insight in to the parallels between the grand houses of God in Rome (beautifully shot by the way) and the temple of modern science that is CERN's large hadron collider facility.Hanks is Hanks pretending to be the smart guy and he fits the role much better second time around than his wooden performance in Da-Vinci. good support is offered by a rock solid cast, with a particular highlight being Armin Mueller-Stahl's stoic Cardinal. but the films main saving grace is it's pace. for the entire running time I was totally engrossed in the story and the film never really gave me time to sit and pick apart its faults in logic.My only serious criticism is that some of the science depicted is at best debatable regards real world authenticity. But that is not the fault of the film makers, rather an observation of the old adage that you should never let the truth get in the way of a good story..Speaking of which the story is a cracker, mixing adventure and a race against time with a good sprinkling of intelligence and a nice twist or two along the way.overall I would highly recommend this to fans of either of the national treasure movies (which this clearly mimics but with a much more serious vibe) and fans of ripping adventure tales in general.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Return of Professor Robert Langdon,"Angels & Demons (2009) is an adaptation of Dan Brown's bestselling mystery-thriller novel of the same title hat is based on the dark secrets in the history of Catholicism and the fight of the Catholic Church against the underground societies and their influence. There is a lot to like in the new film: the pace is very fast and appropriately so, the views of Rome and its historical and art treasures are gorgeous, as well as the look into Vatican chambers, passages, and catacombs. The lecture which was given by Ewan McGregor (who looked very appealing as a young priest) about history of struggle between Catholic Church and mysterious powerful secret society of ""Illuminati"" over the Church's prosecution of scientists 400 years, or the religion against the science, was quite insightful and illuminating. Tom Hanks who reprised the role of the Harvard Professor Robert Langdon with the obvious gift for solving tricky puzzles and finding the meaning of secret symbols was once again on hand to provide the solution for yet another Catholic Church serious crisis that threatens the very existence of Vatican City and the college of cardinals who gathered from all over the world to elect the new Pope . I should admit that I liked Hanks in this movie much better than in the first adaptation of Dan Brown's historic- religious mystery ""Da Vinci Code"". I also found Angels & Demons much more fun to watch, maybe because in the new film, its creators concentrate on the crime/mystery/thriller/action elements and did not try to add much drama to it. The best and to the point description of the film belongs to the official Vatican.newspaper L'Osservatore Romano, which wrote it is a ""harmless entertainment which hardly affects the genius and mystery of Christianity"".

Fast and exciting. a slight improvement over THE DA VINCI CODE.,"My Take: While it's not as detailed as the novel, A&D maintains a fast pace and a thrilling build-up, improving upon its predecessor.I haven't read Dan Brown's THE DA VINCI CODE before seeing Ron Howard's movie adaptation, however I did read Brown's ANGELS & DEMONS prior to Howard's big-screen take on the 2nd (but in the chronology of the novels, the 1st) Robert Langdon saga. I managed to read halfway through before deciding to go see the movie and avoid being disappointed that it wouldn't be half as good as its source. And sure enough, the movie is not as detailed and complex as the novel, already abridging half the novel into its first hour. But that, I guess, is rightfully so. While it does leave a few interesting points dangling, ANGELS & DEMONS is a first-rate thrilling piece of entertainment. Whether or not it has a rushed narrative, the fast pace still keeps the story moving and the novel's necessary bits of excitement don't disappoint on screen.Tom Hanks is back, this time with a much nicer hairdo, as Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, who is summoned by the Vatican Police when a crisis is currently being held in the Holy See during the election of a new Pope. My, have the tables turned! Even after ""exposing"" the greatest Catholic cover-up in THE DA VINCI CODE, the Catholic church now runs to him for help. What irony! Anyway, the threat is the Illuminati, a sacrilegious society once devoted to proving that science, not religion, makes the world go round, resurrecting after hundreds of years to exact vengeance. They have already set an explosive device within its walls and is set to explode at midnight. That little McGuffin is the Antimatter, the exact opposite of our own matter, stolen from CERN in Geneva. Instead of being used as a superior power source at it is intended to be, it's now being used as a sort of bomb that will reduce the Holy See into rubble. Secondly, the four possible candidates for being the next Pope (the Preferiti) have been kidnapped and is set to be killed within four churches in Rome. Which ones? Only Prof. Langdon knows for sure, once again configuring a series of clues that will lead them to ""The Path of Illumination"", the Illuminati's hideout, and the possible location of that precious antimatter. With a little help from the tenacious and inquisitive Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer of MUNICH), they accompany the Vatican Swiss Guard across the streets of Rome as Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch ticks urgently.I can smirk at a lot of things missing from the pages to film reels, but the film gives me very little time for that. Mr. Howard rightfully keeps the pace efficient and gripping, giving us little time to rest easy as even we feel the urgency of the hour. Though usually convicted of being miscast, Hanks makes a mostly apt Langdon (not so much of an action hero, but more of a thinker). Zurer seemingly lacks the greater spunk of the novels depiction of Vittoria, but still gives the role a fine spin. Although, it is quite a waste that the intimate relationship between Langdon and Vittoria are rarely given any depth. Ewen McGregor would have been a total miscast in the role of the Camerlengo, but he makes a dignified man-with-the-robe.With the expense of deeper character development and more detailed clarification of the events, A&D succeeds at being first-rate, fast-paced entertainment, something that Howard's previous Brown opus, THE DA VINCI CODE, sorrily missed. I liked THE DA VINCI CODE, but even I must agree that the thrills and excitement are burdened by some of its self-indulgence. ANGELS & DEMONS rightfully makes up for that.Rating: **** out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
an entertaining piece of hokum,"Three years after the Dan Brown novel ""The Da Vinci Code"" appeared as a film which took a staggering $760 million, another of his books receives the large screen treatment. Although Brown wrote ""Angels & Demons"" first, the film version represents this story, which is sympathetic to the Catholic Church, as following ""The Da Vinci Code"" which was seen as hostile to the Church. Whatever the difference in stance towards Catholicism, Brown's work is always terribly formulaic: a twisting plot set over a matter of hours, lots of symbols and signs, considerable running, much desecration of the flesh, the counterbalancing of religion and science, minimal characterisation, and changing perception of key characters. This time it's all cardinals, cathedrals, crypts and catacombs plus a camerlengo scattered over central Rome and the Vatican.Again Tom Hanks as the Harvard symbologist does his best with a wooden script (but a better haircut) - at least ""Angels & Demons"" is less wordy than ""The Da Vinci Code"". Again there is only one female character - this time Italian physicist Vittoria Vetra (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer). Scottish Ewan McGregor (who struggles to affect a Northern Irish accent), German Armin Mueller-Stahl and Swedish Stellan Skarsgård each play Vatican officials who may be an angel or a demon. It's hard to work out which is the greatest threat: the Illuminati, an anti-matter bomb or the implausibilities of the plot. Papal bull or curate's egg? - you decide. It's a miracle that it works at all, but if you have faith, I confess that it's really quite an entertaining piece of hokum.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"Outstanding Film That May Help Americans Learn About Relgious and Art History: Slightly Better than Howard's ""Da Vinci Code""","There may be something to be said for a getting a second chance. Ron Howard's film based on Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon offering, ""Angels & Demons"", is a tighter better-wrought experience than the first movie ""The Da Vinci Code"", which is actually the second Langdon novel. Tom Hanks is back as Robert Langdon, symbologiste formidable, Dan Brown's Harvard scholar who is always getting drafted to participate in political espionage that is also wrapped up in ancient and medieval history, culture, theology, tradition, symbols and artifacts. You might characterize this stuff as Robert Ludlum meets the History Channel. The beginning is slightly different than the book but keeps the spirit of it well intact.The plot itself is not that dissimilar to the Da Vinci Code. A person has been murdered, an old man no less, in order that a person or persons calling themselves the Illuminati can pilfer a canister of anti-matter, which is as potent as a few nuclear bombs. The Illuminati, an intellectual order that rebelled against the Roman Catholic Church in the 17th century, have apparently reemerged to enact revenge for injustices perpetrated on them by the church 300 to 400 years ago. They have hidden the cannister somewhere in Vatican City, the smallest sovereign country in the world and the political and cultural center of the Roman Catholic Church. When the cannister's batteries run out the anti-matter will be let lose and turn the Vatican and part of Rome into the cultural equivalent of a US land-fill. The Vatican and its 1500 years of history, art, books, records, and architecture will be turned into something reminiscent of Hackensack, New Jersy.And to add insult to injury, the Illuminati have also kidnapped four cardinals. These events also coincide with ""Conclave"", the small period of time when the Roman Catholic Church must determine the new pontiff, aka the pope. All the members of the College of Cardinals have left their respective dioceses from every corner of the world to attend the secret election of the new pope. During Conclave, the cardinals are locked inside an inner set of chambers of the Vatican and do not have access to the outside world until they choose a new pope. Of course, the four kidnapped Cardinals are some of the top contenders for the Office of the Holy Father, aka The Bishop of Rome.Similar to the Da Vinci Code, Langdon must use his knowledge of church history, art and symbolism to find the canister and also save the four kidnapped cardinals. And do it all before midnight when the Vatican will turn into a pumpkin. The film is a nice blend of religious art history with the intensity of a political thriller that you might find in a Robert Ludlum novel. And being able to peruse the Vatican archives, arguably the greatest collection of ancient books dating from the early Middle Ages to the present time, is a scholar's dream. Simultaneously, the intensity never lets up for those who like the sensibility of an action thriller.The outstanding performance of the film has to be Ewan McGregor as Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, the priest who is the acting ""head"" of the church while a new pope is being chosen. In what seems a small insignificant role at first gains high import as the story unfolds. High marks for Hanks, reprising his role as Langdon, who seems to better understand his character than in the first movie. And Ayelet Zurer as Vittorio Vetra holds her own in a stellar cast. The only criticism I have is that the film glosses over her significance and the role of her father, a priest-turned-scientist, which is more fully developed in the book. In the book, Langdon first arrives at CERN, not Vatican City. Some have complained that Langdon's tour of CERN is completely left out of the film, including the late priest-scientist's study.Still an incredible film, far superior to the recent Indiana Jones movie and the last National Treasure installment, with an incredible ending that makes the entire film. Not to give it away, but it rings of a counter-reformation Baroque-style fresco atop the ceiling of a Roman Church. This is one I will definitely have to acquire on DVD. If this is the best way for Americans to learn about their European cultural heritage, via an action movie, then so be it.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Ignore negative reviews, of critics, and non-critics","Agreed: poor performance by Vittoria Vetra, and rather quick-solving of all puzzles, or clues. But still, I don't agree that Angels and Demons was one of the ""let-downs"" of this year. It was good! Perfect symbols or Earth, Air, Fire and Water. Good pace, good performance by Camerlengo and Robert Langdon, good sound effects and music, good sound editing, brilliant cinematography and direction, good editing, a little-hard-to-understand-for-the-layman script but still, how much simpler could it be made? Angels and Demons story follows as such: a pope dies, and somewhere in CERN, a father and daughter create the OPPOSITE or matter, that is ANTIMATTER, which is highly dangerous if it comes in contact with anything that is MATTER, even AIR. So when a Pope in the Vatican has died, and the father who made antimatter is murdered, one thing is obvious: the age-old group of Scientists, Illuminati, have risen again, to take revenge against those who refuted them years ago: the catholic church. And what better time than when a new pope is to be chosen? With the antimatter stolen, Vittoria knows one thing: it can take out the whole of Vatican City if set off. And soon enough, four favorite cardinals are kidnapped, and to be executed one by one every hour. Can the symbologist, Robert Langdon, hand in hand with Vittoria, stop the murders, and stop the ANTIMATTER before it sets off? And who is behind this all? Surely no one can be trusted.This film is one of the highlights of 2009. Go watch it. If you've read the book, you won't love it as much as you'll love it if you HAVEN'T read the book. And yes, for younger, SUBTITLES could be really helpful.I only gave it a solid 7/10 because I've read the book, and of course, the book was MUCH MUCH better.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Slightly More Angel Than Demon,"Angels and Demons provided, well, ""angel"" and ""demon"" moments. Overall, while the movie's ""angel"" moments were worth the price of admission, it lacked a consistent flow as this Ron Howard directed film unevenly spewed the story of Robert Langdon and his defense against the secret brotherhood: The Illuminati.The movie, like most Hollywood blockbusters, was heavy on plot, temperature-raising moments, and intricate details within the setting. I found these aspects of the film to be exceptional. The cat and mouse chase of Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), the unfolding conspiracy theories, the twists and turns of the Papal conclave along with the Swiss Guard provided an engaging and visceral experience. However, the attempts at developing the character of Langdon were vomit producing, at best. His horrid array of boring facts about every stationary historical item and attempts on comedic one-liners were unbelieving and silly. Furthermore, he was inconsistent in the level of angst he displayed over his situation. In one moment, we see Langdon calmly dealing with the incredible news of the Illuminati's involvement and the next, anxiously running to attempt to reach the Path of Illumination before the killer.Based on the hard-to-believe plot, the attempt at creating dialogue about faith between Cardinal Strauss, the Camerlengo and Robert Langdon were unnecessary. Although director Howard is attempting to deepen this action-laced movie, it was a feeble attempt and one that was not appreciated. Furthermore, if anyone still believes every fact behind the conspiracy theories of the Catholic Church and the Vatican, let's get real! Dan Brown, the author of both ""The Da Vinci Code"" and ""Angels and Demons,"" developed history-laden conspiracy theories that have little to no factual backing. He ""lacks a principled approach to history, science and religion, and therefore spreads lies and half-truths that have been circulating in the occult world for the last hundred years,"" writes Dr. Ted Baehr, chairman of The Christian Film and Television Commission and publisher of online website MOVIEGUIDE.Ron Howard has directed several blockbusters including Dan Brown's first novel-turned- movie The Da Vinci Code, Cinderella Man, A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13. Howard's movies typically display a rich and vibrant setting and context upon which to tell a story. He accomplishes this in Angels and Demons. However, unlike some of his previous movies, I find the characters of Langdon, Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), and Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard) to be shallow and one-dimensional. Ewan McGregor, playing the Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, however, pulls an exceptional and deep portrayal of a complex character.Because Angels and Demons provides more ""angel"" moments than ""demon"" ones, this movie is worth seeing despite the inefficiencies. Just don't expect anything more than an action- packed, complex thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awful... quintessential definition of stale thriller,"Unfortunately, Angels and Demons is possibly the worst film I have seen at the cinema this year. (And I paid to see Pink Panther 2 for some reason) Was the book this bad? Could this movie have possibly been any worse? This movie was so uninteresting that I was tempted to get up and walk out, but I was still curious if they were going to actually find a conclusive end to their story. I'm sorry I stayed.This movie is the quintessential definition of stale thriller. Very stale. I kind of feel sorry for Tom Hanks. He's too great of an actor and too much of a legend to be staring in a movie that's this bad. Hey Tom, next time don't sign a multiple picture contract. He had to have been signed BEFORE Da Vinci Code because even he must know how bad that turned out. Why do another? Word of mouth will smash this movie. This movie is just too dumb to succeed but, then again, there's the Tyler Perry rule that says even trash can generate gold.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Robert Landgon (Tom Hanks) is called upon once again to solve the crime and prevent mass destruction.At least Tom Hanks got a haircut this time. The science is laughable. So at least that matches with the rest of the story. The locations are great, and the action helps push the story out in the end.

"Better as a movie,  rather then a book!","I went to the Midnight showing Thursday night with a curiosity I haven't felt since the DaVinci code. Although the DaVinci code is a better book than film, Angels and Demons is just the opposite, directed and paced perfectly with a blend of action, mystery, and academic researching. Unlike Ron Howard's take on DaVinci code, this story was better in film form because it was concentrated and compressed superbly in the Screenplay.The acting by Tom Hanks was light years ahead of his performance in DaVinci. He had some emotion behind his work, and the direction helps the actors too. Everyone was great here, especially Ewan McGregor playing an Scottish version of the Camerlengo perfectly, and straight out of the book! He was soft spoken and powerful at the same time. Supporting cast was decent enough, including a bigger formidable menace in the villain who was far more intimidating then Silas was.I loved the cinematography, and it's the best in cinema history although limited in large exterior shots, besides St. Peter's square. The set combined with real locales made this film seem like a vacation to Rome.As for the academic research, I can honestly say this film is accurate in my mind, being fascinated by the material. It's based on many facts and some theory and so it is easy to decide for yourself what the truth is. And what is probably just Dan Brown's theory. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who is a serious movie goer. It's a 2 1/2 hour film that feels less then that, a 9/10 score.(Minor Spoilers) *Fans of the books: Be prepared for some twists!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Suspend Belief, Enjoy Thoroughly!","Much like the Dan Brown novel that this movie was based on, there is a relatively simple formula to be followed for enjoyment: Suspend belief, enjoy thoroughly!Viewing this film is akin to watching a television show like, say, ""24"". You don't sit back and nitpick every plot point...you just go with the flow and (more often than not) get caught up in the emotional drama. If you are able to do that, this movie will be very enjoyable for you.As I look back on the plot, I just watched the film less then a week ago and I'm still a bit shady as to what exactly was going on...something about ancient Illuminati symbols, the Catholic Church, the election of a new Pope, and underground experiments with the highly explosive ""dark matter"" compound. Much like in ""The DaVinci Code"", everything flies by in such a hurry that it is a bit difficult to digest. However, due to a great screenplay and competent acting, you will likely find yourself sucked into the whole experience.I cannot speak for the movie's accuracy with relevance to the original novel, as it was so long ago that I read it, but perhaps a bit of a departure wouldn't have been a bad thing, as don't most entertainment connoisseurs always say that the book is better than the movie anyway?!Thus, much like the page-turning appeal of the Dan Brown novel of the same name (where you just HAVE to read ""one more chapter"" before turning out the lights), this film does the exact same thing in cinematic fashion. When looked back upon, the pieces may not fit together or even seem downright ludicrous, but it was one heck of a ride!",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

A Trip to Rome via Tom Hanks,"Went to see ANGELS AND DEMONS in Century City, Los Angeles, yesterday with a good film friend and we both left the film with, ""okay, but not great"". However, Tom Hanks looked tremendous in the film, and for me, carried it to its improbable ending. The film was too long in Act one, I fell asleep for 5 minutes of it, and eventually awoke to Hanks coming into Rome. I give Hanks an A+ for all the dialog his character, our kindly Harvard Professor, had to spout out in relation to the historical, or is it hysterical?, relevance of the Catholic Church, in relation to electing a new Pope with some of his brethren having to go through some twists and turns. When the film finally ended, and the fires had died down, I kept thinking, ""there by the grace of God, go I...""

A Powerfully Magnificent Film,"This is certainly the best work of director Ron Howard and actor Tom Hanks so far. Both the acting and direction are nothing less than superb and the script blows the lid metaphorically off Vatican political intrigue. The suspense is absolutely unrelenting and the backdrop of Rome is used in the same way Hitchcock utilized locations. The film is intelligent as well, with brilliant dialog and incredibly insightful plotting. For all viewers this will be a motion picture they will never forget and the fact it was snubbed at the Academy Awards is additional proof of their irrelevancy. This is a simply magnificent motion picture that deserved more acclaim and awards than it received as Hanks and Howard demonstrated what genius truly is and the cinema art form has never been more clearly shown.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not Tom Hanks best film, but...","... He is perfect as Robert Langdon. I don't blame him for this movie, and The Da Vinci Code, for getting the hatred that it did. That blame should go to the writers of this movie. In my opinion, they did a good job with this movie in particular, but of course, it is probably not as good as the book (I'm saying ""probably"" because I've never read the book, but I know that movies that are based on books are almost never as good as the books themselves). The writers had a hard task of transferring this to the big screen, and while they could not get every single detail in, they do stick with the main source of the plot, so it is still a decent enough movie. Again, it's not Tom Hanks best movie (watch Philadelphia, Forrest Gump, the Toy Story movies, and Saving Private Ryan if you want him at his very best), but I blame the writers for that. So, an 8/10 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

If you are searching for profundity it's not going to give you anything.The score by the omnipresent Hans Zimmer is great and builds on the Da Vinci Code well, the editing and cgi work well and ensure that you feel that you are in the Vatican even when they couldn't shoot there.

Angels And Demons A Decent Sequel With Some Flaws,"Angels and Demons is a decent sequel with some flaws which I'll get into later from director Ron Howard whose admirable in making this movie based on a popular book by Dan Brown. Tom Hanks returns as symbolist Robert Langdon who finds himself in another race against time to save four kidnapped Cardinals and somehow prevent a terrorist attack against the Vatican by a legendary secret brotherhood thought to have been extinct known as the Illuminati. Hanks is good as always in the role of Langdon who would give Nicolas Cage's Benjamin Gates from National Treasure a run for his money decoding ancient scriptures. The rest of the cast including Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, and Armin Mueller-Stahl are good as the supporting characters. The film does have a fast pace but some flaws with character development, and a predictable twist near the end I sort of saw coming weighed it down a bit. I still thought the movie was decent though. The action is well executed but there are many moments when it's just go, go ,go, go, go, with not a whole lot of time in between to get to know the characters more. Overall with it obvious plot twist and other flaws aside Angels and Demons isn't that bad of a movie. It could've been better but if you're a fan of the Davinci Code than chances are you'll enjoy this one just as much. This film has action, drama, some suspense, and little humor with good performances by the cast especially Tom Hanks who makes this sequel worth watching at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Aesthetically pleasing but a muddled, implausible picture","I had neither read any of the books nor seen the first movie so after receiving passes to a preview show, I had no expectations.'Angels and Demons' was a muddled, convoluted film lacking direction or any believability. There was very little character development and I never found myself caring about the plight of the protagonists; the reverse was true, I was more interested in seeing how the antagonists would succeed as the first half of the film was almost exclusively focused on why the Illuminati are who they are.The film jumps from location to location with little explanation or reason and expects the viewer to believe that everybody in the movie is an ally when they first meet. Any analytical mind will realize this is highly improbable.The climax is extremely cliché and leaves you asking what happened and wondering why nobody considered some of these points, it feels very tacked on and unnecessary.The actors are not particularly believable in their roles, mostly because I found it difficult to believe that scientists, professors, and men of the church would act in the manner that they do without regard to the consequences of their actions. Events that happen are not plausible in the slightest and the pace of the movie is questionable with the characters jumping around while on a tight schedule and I had to question how the protagonists manage to get from location to location on time, every time.The most pleasing part of the film is the cinematography, I found it a beautiful film to watch but it was such a mess, that I found it would not be worth paying to view in theatres.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Fantastic Adaptation,"As a fan of the book, this work is fantastically adapted; remaining true to the source materials, and demonstrating an honest respect for the literary work. The intrigues translate well to film by virtue of Ron Howard's good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticity.I like Hanks as Robert Langdon. His portrayal is genuine and earthy, with only the barest glint of the Kip we all knew and loved, back in ""the day."" He is a good dramatic actor and, while I miss his comedic efforts, I do enjoy his more serious performances.The subject matter is no less controversial than the DaVinci Code, and the Vatican seems to never learn their lesson. As with the aforementioned film, the Holy See issued a scathing rebuke and called for a global Catholic boycott of the film, which of course, generated millions in ticket sales.Although the story of the ""God Particle"" was played down dramatically, and the science was written out of this piece of science fiction, the fiction that was left, was entertaining and extremely well done. And, the truth be known, people who have not read the book, will not notice any missing or lesser element to the story, as the screen version carries the main story well on its own.In fact, it is not necessary to have seen the first installment of this franchise, in order to enjoy this second, which should have been a prequel in all honesty, although that does not lessen the effectiveness, nor does it meddle with the continuity or flow of this second work.All in all, this is good for a Friday/Saturday night's viewing, although the execution may be a bit rough for the small ones.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Angels and Demons-An Improvement,"Dan Brown's phenomenal bestseller, The DaVinci Code was made into an equally successful film adaptation. Angels and Demons, while actually a prequel to that book, has been adapted into a movie sequel, and the results are certainly more promising. Director Ron Howard and actor Tom Hanks reteam for a better telling of intrigue, murder, and suspense amid a historic and religious setting. Essentially an almost real-time thriller which jumps from ancient landmark to landmark, this film actually works pretty well within its own confines and is thus a satisfying entertainment without getting sidetracked on the holy mission of revelatory discovery and truth that its predecessor got tangled in.A scientific breakthrough in a Swiss laboratory generates powerful, anti-matter particles. When a mysterious group steals this deadly material, they threaten Vatican City with annihilation. The plot thickens when four Cardinals, in consideration to succeed the recently deceased Pope, are kidnapped and threatened with hourly execution at a holy site. Despite his purely scientific, empirical measure of the world, symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks with a normal hairdo this time) is whisked from Harvard campus to Vatican City where he is joined by Dr. Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) whose lab created the stolen particles. Together, they attempt to locate the Cardinals and the anti-matter particles. We meet the Vatican Police guard and their protocols and protectiveness over not only the church and its members, but its archives which are at the heart of Langdon's quest for clues. The Pope's assistant, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), the Vatican Guard Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard), and elder Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) participate in the investigation. History (according to Dan Brown) has it that in 1668, four scientists or free-thinkers known as the Illuminati were kidnapped, branded and executed by the church. Now a darker version of the Illuminati is ready to exact an 'eye-for-an-eye' revenge on the church, and they intend to finish the job with one big bang of anti-matter. The clues lead to the four elements of fire, water, air and earth, and perhaps more. What do these have to with actual church locations? Complicating the proceedings is a mysterious assassin who carries out the lethal agenda with unerring accuracy even as Langdon, Dr. Vetra, and the police attempt to prevent further bloodshed. Should Vatican City be evacuated as thousands of people hold a vigil for the new Pope? Can everyone be trusted even in the most sensitive and elite of holy circles? These questions are raised as Langdon desperately searches for answers to save the Vatican.Having not read the original novel, I feel the film does work on its own which is more than can be said of its predecessor which got lost in self importance and confusing exposition. Screenwriters David Koepp (Jurassic Park, Spiderman) and Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind) have tried to streamline and condense Brown's immense, detailed novel into a serviceable story, which focuses on a race against time and is a pretty decent mystery without having the 'holier than thou' agenda. References are made to Langdon's previous adventure with The DaVinci Code, but the film wisely stays on course almost in actual-time so that the suspense level is ratcheted up progressively until the potentially explosive climax.There are some shortcomings to the film. There is a lot of material covered here so it seems a bit episodic, and plot details that beg for a more patient explanation are raced over. The characters are not sufficiently fleshed out to give more meaning to what happens later. All we get are some brief notes of each person's background to go forward; that is a missed opportunity. Perhaps Dan Brown's book did not give much in the way of detailed history for his players, but that does not excuse the filmmakers from trying to make a stronger, more emotional connection. Further, elements of the plot strain credibility, and you need to make a leap of faith so to speak to accept some pretty amazing coincidences and key events. In particular, the climax is full of major surprises and a stunning turn of events that require a suspension of disbelief.Production values are impressive particularly in the art direction and visual effects to recreate Vatican City (since permission for location shooting was denied). The camera work shows great fluidity, and seldom have visuals been more kinetic as in this film or for that matter any other recent adventure/mystery. This helps in the pacing and overall flow of the story.It's nice for a change to see male and female leads working together without resorting to the obligatory romance. Here, it's strictly business. In fact the film plays almost like a chapter of TV's 24 or The X Files which may determine whether the plot twists and turns are surprising or satisfyingly fresh to the uninitiated viewer. If you have seen The Godfather III, the storyline conspiracies may also seem a bit familiar. Still, you get the feeling that Howard and Hanks have gotten the hang of things this time around. What you get is a moderately interesting mystery in an elaborate, big budget setting. The visuals are impressive but the story itself is nothing special to write home about.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A demonic waste of time and resources,"In short: this film simply does not work. It fails to engage and involve on every level. There is not a hint of character development, and the one-dimensional characters are little more than generic transporters of a weak and diluted plot.It is almost impossible not to compare with the book when trying to understand why this movie fails so badly. The book may not be great literature, and it also suffers from a weak plot and poor character development (though nowhere near as badly as the film), but it still manages to be exactly what it sets out to be: page turning entertainment. The book is highly readable entertainment whereas the movie is, for lack of a better word, boring. Fast paced, but nonetheless boring.We've seen it before: a fast paced story with lots of physical activity does not equal real action. On some level, we need to understand the characters and what drives them in order to get involved with the action. Furthermore, we need to be able to follow the story, and the action must make sense in this story, and carry it somewhere. Who hasn't already seen lots of fights, car chases and explosions? On their own, they are nothing new or exciting. It is only when we understand who is fighting/chasing whom, and why, that the action becomes meaningful and interesting. Story action is so much more than just elaborate stunts and CGI. It is about producing curiosity, dispensing information, character development and providing surprise. In Angels & Demons, we get none of that. We get to watch Tom Hanks jumping from one clue and its conclusion to the next at breathtaking speed, but it produces as much excitement as having last years lotto numbers read out at double speed.There is a huge difference between a fast paced STORY and just fast pace...In essence, watching Angels & Demons is similar to watching someone you don't know play a computer game.Spare yourself the experience and save the money.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Surpasses Da Vinci Code by far,"I went to see this film on opening night, not expecting much because I was somewhat disappointed with Da Vinci Code. I had read both books and already after with DVC's outcome, I was nervous with Angels and Demons.Let me just start off by saying that I think they should have gotten a new script writer rather than Akiva Goldsman. Seriously, he did a bad job of adapting DVC so why bring him back? It pleased me tho to see David Koepp who is more of an action script writer than anything. In the first 15 minutes of the film, you can tell that the tone is different from DVC and is a little more fast paced. The acting is somewhat a little better and so is the dialog(I'm assuming thats Koepps input). The story has been tweaked which bothered me but not to an extent where I wanted to walk out.After the first hour, I was already saying to myself that this film FAR SURPASSES Da Vinci Code. Ron Howards directing is sharper and the score of the film really makes your adrenaline spike with the thrilling scenes.Ewans portrayal of the Cameralngo was really good and the rest of the cast did what was expected of them. The cinematography was excellent and all the sets were superb. The story itself was pretty good although it could have been so much better.

IMPROVE on the novel -- Might be better experienced on DVD,"We know the universally accepted rule: No screen adaptation can beat the book it's based on. And a book is the best way to experience a story. But there are exceptions to every rule. And this movie was it. I felt it was one of the rare occasions when a movie rises above the novel it's based on to improve on it.THE BOOKS: First let me say that I read both ""Angels & Demons"" and ""The Da Vinci Code"" books in the chronological order of the saga, i.e. I started first with A&D. And I was so unimpressed by the A&D novel that I had to force myself to finish it. I think the A&D story started well enough but devolved into a convoluted, unbelievable and barely palatable mess in the end. I thought the writing was quite sloppy too. The DVC book was overall better. However both books sealed my personal view that Dan Brown's success with this saga was not with his style and skill as a writer but rather with his controversial subjects and settings. And it's a fact that a good controversy makes for good publicity.THIS MOVIE: With this in mind, I went to see A&D with the expectation/hope that it will HAVE to be better than the book. And I was not disappointed. I think the movie streamlined and purged the mess of the novel and made the story more enjoyable.On the other end, while watching it, I could not help but think that someone who is not at all familiar with the story might perhaps be a bit confused especially during some of the fast paced events and action sequences. Having read the novel before hand helped me. A screen adaptation should be able to stand on its own and be clear when telling the story. Because of this, I rated this movie ""7"" instead of a higher score.In all, I would gladly suggest (perhaps a lone voice here, LOL) to skip the novel and see the movie if you want to know what all the fuss was about with this story. And for an even better experience (especially if you are not at all familiar with the saga), wait for the DVD. That way you can rewind at will to clarify any confusing sequences.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
High-flown malarkey...tasteless in its self-seriousness,"Adaptation of Dan Brown's bestseller, a follow-up to 2006's ""The Da Vinci Code"", has so much plot exposition, location trotting, CGI effects and elaborate camera set-ups in the first 30mns, one is apt to be blown away or perhaps toppled over by the breathless racing about. Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, author and professor of religious symbols and societies, who is called upon by the Commander of the Vatican in Rome after a precious vial of anti-matter is violently stolen from a top secret lab in Geneva (which we see) and four Cardinals--candidates for the late Pope's empty chair--are kidnapped (which we don't see). Seems an underground sect named the Illuminati is behind the dirty deeds, and they plan on killing one Cardinal every hour until the stroke of 12 when the contents of the vial will destroy Rome. Extremely slick, extremely familiar jigsaw puzzle movie with absolutely no mystery--just Tom Hanks rattling off information before rushing from Point A to Point B. The killings smack of ""Se7vn"", while the ensuing relationship between Hanks and brilliant scientist Ayelet Zurer is delineated for us in cartoonish terms. Ron Howard also returns as director, and one can almost sense his desire to flood the narrative with jargon (and the screen with slapdash movement) so that the gaps of credibility and logic won't show through. ""Angels & Demons"" has a highbrow air about it which causes some viewers to think they're seeing something powerful and important, but don't be fooled. It is an expensive picture, burnished and foreboding; however, it's about as intrinsically satisfying as junk food--and just as bad for you. NO STARS from ****",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I'm anxiously awaiting a (hopeful) sequel from Mr. Ron Howard and Tom Hanks. It Also had a great musical score in the film. And It was composed by Hans Zimmer, so if you are a fan of his, this is a double-entente. In My Opinion, the only score done by Hans that outdoes this is 2008's The Dark Knight, though i can draw certain similarities to both of the film scores. so, Yes, you should see this movie. the catholic church has gave this film unfair press, so do not let that persuade you either. it's just a movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Faithful but sometimes unbelievable!,"Still haven't read a single Dan Brown book, but I watched all his movies adaptations. I won't fall into the game to rate this one with the previous because the scope isn't really the same: actually, this one is a thriller, a race against time filled with puzzles.The plot is very twisted, imaginative and the cast is excellent: I never been a great fan of Hanks but he delivers well. I noticed his jeans shirt (the one spilled with blood) because I search for one like this in vain! The Italian searcher is a brilliant newcomer for me but I really applauded Ewan MacGregor portrayal: his inner faith and calm is really impressive.I really like the debate between science and religion. The action taking place in the Vatican, it felt like vacation. At last, I am not sure it helps to add new converts into Christianism. With all the gold and man presence displayed, any one would ask what charity means and why women are so dismissed of the church life whereas they stand for half or more the believers.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I like to look and read about such plots and stories.. The film has been shown in Russia recently. I did not look yet. I wish to look it very much. But Den Brown's book I have read the some years ago! Though in the book basically the point of view of the author is shown only, its many remarks its her opinion only which is not proved. However, the book is very interesting also I hope a film will be not worse. Da Vinci Code I was disappointed in the film. But this book is remarkable. Though the Catholic church is not happy with an exit of this book and she can be understood. That is described in the book contradicts church laws. Much in the book is own opinion of the author only, but it is useful to esteem, it develops.Very informative and interesting, also it is easily read! I hope to you it will be pleasant!

The movie will disappoint a lot of book fans, especially the ending. In the book, the ending is the best part, all the truths have been told at the end; the movie clearly missed one of the most important ones(I better just stop here and let you guys find it out in the book by yourselves). Compare to the DaVinci Code, I liked The DaVinci Code better, I love movies that are associated with solving mysteries from the past history, which is why I loved the atmosphere of The DaVinci Code. Angels & Demons is more like a pure action movie for me, those deep discussions of the relationship between science and religion are also disappeared in the movie. The movie becomes less meaningful compare to the book; but if you didn't read the book, it would still be a solid thriller to watch.So here, me, as an audience, not a book fan, I give this movie a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The movie and the book must be evaluated separately,"Two days ago, I've finished reading the Dan Brown's novel and right after I've watched the movie.First of all: Do not ever do like this! :) (I'm talking not only for ""Angels & Demons"" but for all novel adaptations.)Because the novel will cloud your judgement about the movie. Yes, I totally agree with the comments saying ""the movie is way different than the book"" but it is impossible to adapt a whole book for a certain amount of time. Therefore changes are inevitable.Considering that, I might say that the movie is an above average Hollywood production with lots of action and mystery. My point is 6.5/10.Like I wrote, I can understand changes but why did they change some names of characters?

Be Gentle Inside these Walls,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Ron Howard is back jabbing at the catholics with help from Dan Brown's prequel to DaVinci Code. This time it is a full out action film and Tom Hanks as Professor Robert Langdon shares some attitude with Indiana Jones! Italy in general, and Vatican City in particular, make for stunning scenery for this assault on the senses. The to-scale set of St. Peter's is marvelous, as are the not open to the public areas of catacombs and Vatican archives. Can't help but enjoy seeing the historic sites as Hanks and Ayelet Zurer (Vantage Point) race through the city trying to stop the massacre of four cardinals.Supporting work from Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller-Stahl is particularly effective, though Ewen McGregor is out of place here. Mueller-Stahl's recent history of playing bad guys certainly plays right into the hands of the filmmakers. Don't miss Ron Howard's dad, Rance, as one of the Cardinals. Sadly, brother Clint makes no appearance.My preference of this story would be more intrigue and insight into the secret society of the Illuminati, and I do wish more of the Roman sites could be on display ... but this is terrific popcorn fare and will be enjoyable for most.

Dull AND Dumb,"If anyone thinks this mess of a movie and its poor presentation is a quality film then they are just fooling themselves. It's OK to praise a quality director (which he used to be... what the heck happened, Ron?) but at least let his latest effort earn that praise. It doesn't make you a true movie connoisseur to rave about an idiotic movie just because huge names are attached. It makes you a pathetic follower who can't use his or her own head and feelings to decide what is good. Forget the individual award nominations that are based on reputation. This movie is just flat out bad even if it is Ron Howard pointing the camera at Tom Hanks. They need to break up and go their separate ways because their collaboration peaked on Apollo 13 and is now destroyed in flames by Da Vinci and this terrible sequel.Skip the movie and get the same thing from one of those crazy Tom Cruise anti-Christian interviews. Bizarre context mixed with a lot of head scratching. Preposterous movie that never let's you go with any flow or enjoy the movie on any level.",,Anonymous,Mystery
"Definitely better than The Di Vinci Code, but still lacking","Angels and Demons is another movie adapted from one of Dan Brown's best selling novels. Like The Di Vinci Code before it, Angels and Demons pits symbology expert Professor Robert Langdon against a thought to be extinct society. Once again the Catholic church is targeted for humiliation and destruction. Instead of revealing a giant cover-up by the church, Robert Langdon unravels the reason behind four church officials being kidnapped and has to find them before they are murdered publicly one by one.This story feels very familiar yes, but just as with the books I enjoyed this movie more than The Di Vinci Code. The story is more fantastic than the other one, although still grounded deep in historical facts and accurate knowledge of the workings of the church and government agencies that get involved. This element of the story is what draws people to these movies and the books that they are based off of. There is nothing like it out there. Most movies are far over the top of realism so that you can escape into the world on screen, but with Angels and Demons you feel like you are watching news coverage of an actual event taking place. You can easily put yourself into the shoes of the characters and have the adventure with them.This face is probably the saving grace of this movie, because the acting sure isn't the greatest out there. While Tom Hanks has made some great movies ( we have all seen Forrest Gump and Apollo 13 ) this really isn't his best work. While it could have been the director mucking things up; I really think someone with his level of experience should be able to overcome such hurdles and turn out something on a higher scale than this.I still enjoyed myself throughout the movie, even knowing the story and the ending. This definitely is more of a rental though. Seeing it in the theater did nothing to enhance the experience for me. I would much rather be comfortably in bed or on the couch watching this than pay the expense of the movie theater.So, the final verdict is wait for the dollar theater or to rent Angels and Demons. While the story is solid, it's too much like the last movie in the plot and acting.Written by Sam for www.overcranked.net",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Ron Howard's Angels & Demons,"First you should know this is not Dan Brown book. This is Ron Howard's Angels & Demons. A different story line with his biases added. Ron Howard direction and Tom Hanks performance was equal to Da Vinci Code. The movie has good action, great sound effects and a lot of eye candy. The 140 minutes went by fast. Like most sequels the uniqueness of the first movie is all ready out of the hat. The uniqueness is lost the second time around. Do not go to the movie thinking this will be the best movie ever, it is not. If you go thinking this will be fun, you will be right. I give this movie 9 out of 10. . I am a fan of Ron Howard and Tom Hanks movies and wish if they have to state their political views that they would give both sides of the issue.

THIS IS NOT A ROLE FOR Ewan McGregor. He was so bleak portraying this character, that it is difficult to see any defense for this casting.BUT THERE IS ANOTHER CASTING that is equally worse, and It is clear to see that somebody chose Nikolaj Lie Kaas to play the Assassin, is so far off the mark that even Ewan McGregors role in the film can be defended - - - The Assassin is described by Dan Brown in vivid colors of personage.

Angels & Demons... No better than the DaVinci Code,"As assumed Angels & Demons was a very mediocre film. Director Ron Howard and Actor Tom Hanks should be ashamed of their efforts when they made this movie because both are much more talented that what they did here for 138 minutes. The plot was about the only interesting part of this movie. However, the interesting story was ruined by Hanks' inability to encompass a believable character(Robert Langdon). Granted he did have some complex dialogue but nothing he said sounded like he actually knew what he was talking about. If the main character is supposed to be a well respected professor and the integrity of the movie depends on the authenticity of the character then Hanks' should have put in a little more time trying to comprehend his lines instead of just flatly reciting them throughout the entire movie. Once again, like the DaVinci Code there were several cheesy and ""convenient"" epiphanies that could have been executed in a more clever manner. Otherwise, the remainder of the supporting cast: Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgård, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, and Armin Mueller-Stahl all performed very well. The lead female Ayelet Zurer was not bad but anyone could have played next to Hanks in this movie and looked just fine. The best part of Angels & Demons was probably the last riveting 30 minutes, which basically salvaged its grade from a 4/10 to a 6/10/.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The most awful filming of a book ever!,"This was by far the most awful, nail curling film i have seen in quite a while. I wanted to throw my laptop through the window while watching, I wanted to surgically remove my brains so that I do not have to live with the memory of having watched this film.Saying this, it is obviously is have read the book before i watched the movie. because, there are more than 50 (I counted) things that do not match the book. In fact I think there are more things incorrect than correct according to the book.This is THE perfect example of a film butchered by Hollywood.I wanted to say Ron Howard is the most terrible director mankind has ever known. But I can't. He directed Cindarella Man and A Beautiful Mind, which both are really good movies. But he sure slaughtered and butchered this one. I simply do not believe Ron Howard read Dan Brown's book before making this film, he probably only read a summary on the internet.There are simply too many things wrong with this film to mention every one of them, but I will give it a go.1. Where is Mr. Phillipe????? 2. Vittoria Vetra did not discover the body of her father 3. In the movie this isn't even her father 4. where is the ultrasonic jet that flew Langdon to Geneva (he didn't even visit Geneva in the film) 5. There are three fighting scenes cut out (the one in the fountain, the one in San Angelo and the one in the 'fire' church where Langdon gets stuck behind the tomb) 6. Robert Langdon did not flew with the Camerlengo in the chopper (of course in the book he did) 7. THE FOURTH CARDINAL WAS NOT MURDERED?!?! 8. Not only that, he is elected for Pope, what the hell is that about? 9. In the book, there were trouble with the number of police men that could be used. While in the movie, the Vatican police, the Carabinieri and even S.W.A.T. teams are all over the place.I think you catch my drift here.It would have been better if Ron Howard simply used another name for the movie, contacted Dan Brown that he used fractions of his book and that's it. This, by far, nowhere near a filming of a book. I am really p*ssed of about the fact that I just gave up 2 hours of my life to watch this worthless piece of junk film, knowing I will never get those two hours back.I even feel bad for Tom Hanks and Ewan McGregor that they starred in this film, because they are both great actors and should not be in a useless film like this.So my tip to you is, if you read the book but didn't watch the movie, DO NOT WATCH IT! If you didn't read the book and didn't watch the movie, you perhaps can watch it, but still I doubt the fact you will give it higher than a 6.This was my review and I hope I will stop people from watching this film by heaving them read this review.Jan M Eindhoven Netherlands",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A gripping thriller that falls on deaf ears.,"I think Ron Howard did a great job, but the script brought the film down like a dead weight. Whenever an interesting relationship or element pops up, it's left and we continue on, and with the film being pretty fast paced and 'OMG NO TIME LEFT, Wilson' this does work most of the time, but I found myself wanting a break from the primary action about 2/3 of the way in.But, here's the reason I decided to write a review. The freaking dialog, it's awful. Probably around 95% of the dialog is just exposition, a history lesson or a cue for the people who didn't pick up the visual tell. It is a deeply historical film and therefore needs the contextual underpinning, but we don't need to know every detail about everything that gets mentioned. It drags the plot and at times, can be frustrating.Lastly, I think there was a female actress in there. I don't know. I think she popped up every time needed a translator or the heroic professor was left by the police. All she seemed to do was answer questions or give Langdon an excuse to think out loud. Which is a shame, because the relationship between science and theology is one of the key topics of the film, and this ambiguous female character - a scientist at CERN - could have been the link between these. But no, all the seemed to do was act a medium for Langdon's thought.Other than the script, it is quite a well-made film and is definitely worth a watch if you're up for a bit of gung-ho church-hopping.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Still a good Dan Brown styled thriller, yet it lacks weight on the major theme","Again as with Da Vinci Code, the story looked like it's taken straight from the Dan Brown novel considering Langdon is always explaining things much like a walking encyclopedia. The thriller aspect improved in this movie compared to Da Vinci Code as it feels that the suspense is kept at almost all the duration of the movie by using the fast paced story flow and the many speeding car and running people scenes. Although this means less action part compared to Da Vinci Code, this also means that the story is being brought to its originally designed genre of thriller. Yet it's quite regrettable that the subject of the main theme, the Illuminati, feels lacking in comparison of Da Vinci Code's main plot. Tom Hanks' role as the intelligent yet faithless scholar is a straight continuance from his role in Da Vinci Code. Ewan McGregor can play the character with the hidden agenda very well; his character will turn out very nice especially to those previously oblivious to the story through the book. Stellan Skarsgaard also bring out nice color to this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I wanted to leave the cinema and go home, there I would be able to do far more interesting things than wasting my lifetime with watching such BEEP as 'Angels & Demons'.luckily enough for me, the second half of the picture was superb. it was as if Brown and Howard found a perfect match. thus, the construction of the film is really good: the first half it's boring as hell and everyone wants to leave the building, but the second half makes it worth you 'lost' your money.still, the acting performances are bad. really bad. it's the story of the second half that really made my day. but even then, there are some things that aren't explained very well in the movie. why all this clues? why this organized search? don't worry, you get the answers if you think about it, but that will only happen if you a) read the book. or b) talked about the movie during the ride home.conclusion: hats off to Dan Brown and Ron Howard, they did a really good job working together, even though the movie itself has got it's faults.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Be careful...these are men of God.,"'Angels and Demons' is the sequel to the controversial 'The Da Vinci Code'. Although once again dealing with the Church, it's not as controversial and merely an action thriller set in the Vatican.Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, who is called in by the Vatican to solve a mystery and save the Vatican. Shortly after the death of the Pope, four cardinals were kidnapped from the Vatican. The culprits are believed to be the Illuminati, who threatens to execute the cardinals at specific times. A canister of antimatter has also been stolen, and will be used to destroy the Vatican.The film therefore becomes a race against time for Langdon to find the clues that will lead him, a nuclear physicist and a team of policemen to the antimatter. There's a lot of information here to consume. They give so much information, which I'm not sure whether it is indeed fact, all fiction, or part fact/part fiction. Someone as ignorant as me on the particular subject would never tell the difference, but it certainly does make for interesting viewing either way.With all its traditions and beliefs, Christianity almost comes across as a cult, and a very selfish one at that. The Vatican sure do believe they are the chosen ones, don't they?'Angels and Demons' has a beautiful score, good cinematography, and is reasonably fast-paced, ensuring a wonderful, thrilling movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's holy fun.,"""And the Vatican didn't like that. So the church began to, how did you say it? Oh, hunt them down and kill them."" Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks)For a fallen down Catholic boy like me, any time the Church is depicted as manipulative now and downright bloody then (a few centuries ago) confirms my suspicions that it is a business and a brand just like any other multinational corporation. Angels & Demons shows a troubled contemporary Vatican reaching out to its Da Vinci Code antagonist, Harvard professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), to solve the mystery and murders associated with an ancient and violent antagonist of the church, The Illuminati, which appears to be revived after ages of obscurity.Given that director Ron Howard was barred from filming in the Vatican, including St. Peter's Square, the production is stunning, an evocation of its baroque grandeur beautiful to see in re-creation. While the serpentine story speeds from church to church to track murders before they happen, Langdon acquires an attractive scientist partner, Dr. Ayelet Zuhrer (Vittoria Vetra), with whom he is intimately involved in solving the crime but not in salving the audience's wound of disappointment for lack of romantic adventure.I applaud the director for allowing the order of the day, stopping murders, to trump the audience's romantic expectations, a distracting Hollywood tradition that needs to die in the face of contemporary sophistication about sexuality and liberation.Although Angels and Demons touches on such religious chestnuts as the struggle between good and evil, it does a credible job tackling the longstanding feud between science and faith, with science and its antimatter discovery threatening half of Rome. But the film doesn't go too far with the debate because it is first of all entertainment with just enough intellectual stimulation to satisfy any stimulus bill around.",,Anonymous,Mystery
That's Entertainment!,"Entertaining yarn which rattles along at a high octane pace and is miles better than the Da Vinchi code.""Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon works to solve a murder and prevent a terrorist act against the Vatican.""All action movie, colorful sets, locations and scenery, excellent music plus some intelligent dialogue; and the picture has an aura of realism even though the whole story is absurd and preposterous. Pity someone has not got the courage to make a true film about the current scandals in the RC church.This movie goes on a bit too long and at times is almost comical, nonetheless, mostly held my attention throughout, hence deserves:7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good all rounder with a fast pace!,"Well I can't say this is in my top list of movies. I don't think it would even come close to making it. However, I am most definitely giving this movie a POSITIVE review. The reason for this is that it is simply an enjoyable ride from start to finish! The description I read from another comment of the movie being 'A Roman Cat and mouse with Forrest Gump' is close although maybe just a bit too harsh as I felt a bit more entertained than that would give! I watched 'The Davinci Code' too and like many others I really didn't think too highly of it. This time around, different movie I know but similar in m,any ways and of course the obvious one being the backdrop of the Vatican and all its glorious architecture. Some might say it is worth seeing the movie for that. I wouldn't. :-) I'll just say if you want a nice, enjoyable watch, nothing too serious and scientifically and historically, complete fabrication (although there are lots of nods to real events etc, the whole premise is fantastical!), plus you like a movie to have the mysterious killer (although it was far too predictable at times!) and the high speed chases to save people, the big ending and well...you want to waste a couple of hours, ...... then I would say you really should watch this movie.It's good. Just not great.6 stars from me.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Brilliant suspense.,"Angel's and Demons is an adrenal stirring thriller depicting homicides in cathedral that involves science on one hand and faith on the other. It showcases the attempt to resurrect the old war between science and religion with almost success with twists and turns throughout. It shows who is Angel and Demon in exact sense, surpassing the stereotypical views of society. It covers the areas of science politics and religion in conflict with one another and the true nature of the characters involved in it. I liked that very much.Ron Howard visualizes the war instigating situation in suspenseful way, knitting well the subplots spanning several areas. The film of course requires the brilliancy in following the steps of the script, word by word. Some may not follow it. I somehow followed the script and so felt that the film delivered what it intended to deliver despite the lacking of maestro narratives. I have ignored the book adaptation and emphasized upon the film itself.Robert's strategy in finding the culprit is brilliant and interesting. The actress is intelligent and decent too, carefully scripted to fit in a catholic theme. The story is too well framed- The Culprit decides to murder 4 cardinals upon 4 altars of science and detonating a bomb of cataclysmic power on the Vatican itself starting from 8 at night with the aim of resurrecting the old war. The mission is to search the cardinals and save the Vatican from that bomb. Ewan McGregor is the show stealer of the film. He is the unpredictable person who could be most brilliant and most foolish person at the same time. There are few flaws in the film but I ignored that. It delivers the thrills and the messages too. The statement - ""Beware of them, they are the men of God"" is still my favorite, has truth in multiple levels.The film fastly progresses through several subplots imbibing thrills after thrills which finally ends in simple note--Don't Lie. The demons lie and the innocents are harassed for that. The film depicts the well known idea that an Angel doesn't need to be a member of Church to be an angel. And the same goes for the Demons too. It's nevertheless a bold film where some cardinals are shown smoking and many aspects of the catholic church but praiseworthy for its justified ending where goodness triumphs upon evil. Apart from that the film is visually stunning and intellectual to say the least. A brilliant suspense in a nutshell. An 80/100.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
I am disappointed,"I read about 2 months ago Angels and Demons by Dan Brown. Then my wife read it. Yesterday on Monday May 9, 2011 my wife and I saw the movie Angels and Demons on Blue Ray extended version. When I read the book I was thrilled by the writing of Dan Brown, the excitement and the story set before my eyes. The movie is so different from the original story, lots of elements have either disappeared or have been changed in such a way that I think it does not reward Dan Brown enough. Mind you the special effects are spectacular and Tom Hanks like usual is brilliant in the role of Professor Langdon but I must say that both my Wife and I are disappointed. Where is Kobler??? Langdon's girlfriend in the book is warm and emotional. the actress who plays her in the movie is cold as ice. The assassin who in the book appears so powerful looks like a geek in the movie. For just a movie without reading the book its OK but after reading the book this movie is a flop.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It was a good movie.,"This is a movie review site. If you want to review a book, go to IBDB or somewhere. It doesn't matter that you may have liked a book better then a movie, a cow better then a house, or a race car better then a birthday cake.It was a good movie. Do not listen to reviews comparing it to a book for some reason. That's not to say people can not give an opinion on the book/movie similarity or dissimilarity. However, just because someone trashed the movie, because it wasn't the same as what they expected, based on a book, does not mean the movie was not good in it's own right. Sheesh.The movie had suspense, twists, humor, intrigue, and intelligence. It was well acted, written, and directed. The production was top notch from all technical aspects.

Faith is a gift I have yet to receive.,"Angels and Demons is directed by Ron Howard and adapted to screenplay by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman from the Dan Brown novel of the same name. It stars Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Kaas and Armin Mueller- Stahl. Music is scored by Hans Zimmer and cinematography by Salvatore Totino.Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is summoned to Rome and asked by the Vatican to help when four cardinals are kidnapped. Upon examining a tape recording that announces that the cardinals will be killed one at a time hourly, Langdon places the crime at the door of the ancient Illuminati. It's a race against time to not only try and save the lives of the cardinals, but also to avert the detonation of an anti-matter bomb which will destroy Vatican City.In spite of The Da Vinci Code making gargantuan amounts of cash, there were many who actively hated the movie. Yet this follow up from Howard and his makers still enticed just under $500 million's worth of worldwide paying punters into see it. Ultimately it's a very different movie to Da Vinci, where that film was sombre and talky, and had a great religious hook that caused tremors in Christianity, Angels and Demons is a pacey race against time serial killer thriller. Albeit one that is still religion based and additionally topped up with some sci-fi gubbins.The ticking time bomb format works well as a cliff hanger and the narrative allows Langdon and his latest lady investigator, CERN scientist Vittoria Vettra (Zurer), scope for no-nonsense detective work. There's a good solid mystery story at the heart, one which doesn't veer to being over complicated, and the production value is of a very high standard. Casting is first class, with McGregor and Skarsgard complimenting the reliable, and thankfully new haircut sporting, Hanks. It's a little draggy in the mid-section, as history comes crashing into the mix and the makers feel the need to be cerebral, and the finale is bizarre if wholly appropriate, but herein lies the problemIf you can judge it on its own terms, not as a Dan Brown novel recreation and a link to bad memories of Da Vinci Code (not me, I liked it well enough actually)? Then it's a film of simple pleasures. If not then it kind of goes without saying that you probably already dislike the movie! 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Worst movie ever,"A horrible, slow, illogical, boring movie that made almost no sense whatsoever. If the bio-matter is going to blow up the whole city then why haven't detectives investigated who broke into the lab, then track that guy down, and recover the bio-matter bomb? It seems that the whole vatican police force is angry with the Hanks character, so why would he even bother staying and trying to help?Why does the Hanks character fumble around looking for the earth, fire, water, air statues for hints to finding dead priests and answers to how they were killed instead of just trying to find the bomb and save the city?The power going out in the airtight book vault was hilarious. There would be enough air in that room for them to breathe for a week, but they were gasping for air almost immediately. Those books were supposed to be priceless, yet they used the bookcase to try to break out, then of course the the power came back on.The bomb seemed to be described to be more powerful than a nuclear bomb so taking it up a couple thousand feet in a helicopter would only make it more effective in destroying the city. There's no auto-pilot in choppers and nobody ever parachutes out of them. Also wouldn't everyone with any common sense take cover from the expected bomb blast? I cannot imagine anyone enjoying this movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The swashbuckler feel of the book is missing.,"Representatives of the Vatican police now approach Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks,) who you might remember from ""The da Vinci code."" He has been told a mysterious cabal has kidnapped four Cardinals and they are threatening to kill, one an hour unless their demands are met. Langdon, being a symbologist, has been requested to use his skills to locate and free the Cardinals before it is too late. But what is it that they forgot to tell Langdon?I will not go through the whole story as the bulk of the movie is the surprises that you find as the story unfolds. You will also find you have fun kibitzing with do not go here do not look there.The movie itself makes a good sequel to the da Vinci code and the characters stay true to form. However, it is too bad if you read the book first as you will find this Langdon is more subdued, and many books' characters combined are eliminated for brevity's sake.Although this is an excellent movie and brings up many thoughts and subjects on religion and science, it is still watered down compared to the book. We also find that even though Robert Langdon is in the driver's seat what we miss is the ""constantly coming back from the dead"" Robert Langdon of the book. In his attempt to make this a more plausible story Ron Howard has turned Robert Langdon into just another symbologist when he could have been more of an Indiana Jones.One of my favorite characters in the movie is Inspector Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino), he has a great attitude and some good one-liners.I have only seen the Blu-Ray edition so I cannot compare it against the other additions. Nevertheless, be sure to watch the added DVD extras. Some of the extras overlap each other but are still worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"An Exciting First Five Acts with Intrigue and Thrill, but Struggles to Hold Momentum","It is difficult to review 'Angels & Demons' without understanding the comparison to 'The Da Vinci Code'. This movie had a much more simpler and straightforward multi act script with chapter by chapter progress that allowed the producers to work in Dan Brown's religious concepts and interweave them with far more clarity. Tom Hanks is noticeably more engaging and is given a lot more movement and human conviction. There is real tension that is mesmerising and horrific as you feel a genuine desire to root for the protagonist.However the villain has little to say that is meaningful, and the overall final acts are dark, bland and boring.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Angels and Demons is a disappointing movie.,"I can see why the Vatican didn't have any objections to this film. The reason is because it was so badly adapted and poorly put together that they knew it would get bad reviews on its own. The church didn't need to interfere in this one. I guess Dan Brown really needed the money. Otherwise I can't see how anyone would allow their work to be bastardized this badly.In the closing credits, it says something to the effect of ""based on the adaption of."" What it should have said was ""based on the very loose, poor adaptation and the location is the only thing we have in common of."" The movie was so dissimilar to the novel in storyline and characters that I wondered if I was in the wrong theater. Clearly the directors took massive amounts of liberty in shooting the film. I fully recognize that you cannot adapt a Dan Brown novel 100% into a 2 hour movie (like Santa delivering all of the presents in one night) but the liberties they took went too far and strayed very far from the book. Ewan Mcgregor who is a fine actor was not the right person for the role of Carmalengo. Vittoria Vetra was not fully developed and a very critical element was left out of the movie. I think what annoyed me the most about the movie is the four preferiti plot line. In the attempt to be politically correct and story-wise expedient, they fail tremendously to deliver on this story-line.If I didn't read the novel ahead of time, I probably would have been kinder in my score but since I did, I really tried to like the movie and was excited for its release. It was just disappointing. The only liberty which I approved of was changing the assassin from being a Muslim to a non-Muslim. There seems to be too many movies where Muslims are evil and this change does not affect the movie at all.I generally judge a movie based on whether I would pay full price, matinée price, Netflix/video rental or don't bother at all. Angels and Demons is a Netflix/video rental at best because the movie disappointed on so many accounts.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Directed by Ron Howard, Starring my favorite and everybody's favorite Tom Hanks... and yes, people have been roaring the novel.... and the film has become a major blockbuster.I enjoyed 'The Da Vinci Code', but 'Angels & Demons' written by the same author, made by the same director & and has the same actor reprising his role. Now here it is, 'Angels & Demons' is cinema at its best. A all-rounder, a highly entertaining, highly gripping, highly delightful experience.

Doctor Langdon Is Back,"It's now been three years since Tom Hanks as Dr. Robert Langdon solved the mystery of Jesus and Mary Magdalene and that Audrey Tautou from The DaVinci Code is their descendant. You wouldn't think that for one minute the Catholic Church would call on this guy in a crisis. But that's what The DaVinci Code sequel Angels & Demons would have us believe. After all this guy basically ripped apart the linchpin of the Christian faith.But now four cardinals have been captured on the eve on the conclave to elect a new pope and with some jurisdictional disputes raging, some in the Vatican have called in Tom Hanks. The culprit is that notorious secret society the Illuminati and not only have they captured four of the cardinals and are threatening to kill them, but are threatening to blow up the Vatican itself with an anti-matter device. The anti-matter was stolen from the supercollider in Geneva which brings scientist Ayelet Zurer into the picture as well.So with Hanks trying to decipher codes from the Vatican archives in much the same way Nicholas Cage was working in National Treasure and Zurer around to see the bomb doesn't go off, it's a race against time to save the Vatican and its cardinals.Director Ron Howard and Tom Hanks did a great job with The DaVinci Code, but in the sequel they came up way short. Church politics can get good and nasty sometimes, but this one was way too much for my taste.Better this sequel just not have been made.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Interesting concept and executed brilliantly!,"Unlike the much-hyped 'The Davinci Code' that I had entered the room, completely aware and ready to compare with to the book, this time I had the privilege of viewing Brown's 'Angels & Demons' with no more knowledge than the fact that it would be somehow related to Christianity. Put simply, I was 100% oblivious of what the movie was about - I just knew it was the follow up and that was anticipation enough.And I must say, I found it brilliant!!! The concept of answering the much debated Science and Religion controversy in conjunction with the abduction and execution of cardinals was indeed NEW and engaging. From the beginning, I was caught in suspense, and that suspense augmented as the plot thickened. Maybe it was because I had never read the book (thank 'God'), but nonetheless, it remains one film that I have not been able to forget about, and will ponder about for at least the next coming months.Well done Howard!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

a BAD movie that relies solely on religious controversy to sell tickets...Don't waste your money.,"Basing a film on pseudo-historical claims can be a good idea but it's too bad that isn't the case for this awful, awful movie.

They sure didn't here, it's not smart, not interesting and it certainly isn't any fun. Don't waste your money.Ron Howard really is at it again. He gave us the biggest film-making ""FU"" to the viewing public of all time with the Da Vinci Code. (""Sure, it's bad fiction but I love to rile up them there Catholics."")

A little less controversy still makes a fun movie,"Ron Howard made a splash three years ago with his adaptation of Dan Brown's best seller The Da Vinci Code. The Catholic Church and countless religious groups protested the films release, only to make it one of the highest grossing films of 2006. It only made sense that Howard would take the helm of Brown's other book, Angels & Demons.Now, I have not read either of Brown's books so I cannot give a comparison to the films. I did however really enjoy The Da Vinci Code and looked forward to Angels & Demons with great anticipation.After watching it, I felt close to the same as I did with Da Vinci: satisfied. I won't say that this film is better or worse than the previous one because it isn't really. I'd say it's right on par and there is no reason why people shouldn't see it.The story follows Professor Robert Langdon, played by Tom Hanks who reprises his role from the previous film. He is called upon by the Vatican police to help them locate four missing cardinals. Simultaneously, a group of scientists create, without going into details, something that can blowup, only to have some of it stolen. The two stories are linked and Langdon must sort it all out. What makes matters worse is the Pope has just passes and a new one must be chosen, ideally one of the four kidnapped cardinals.The group who is responsible is an underground cult called the Illuminati, people who were hunted down by the Church for their beliefs in science. They say they will kill the cardinals and that the device they stole will detonate by midnight, wiping out Vatican City and part of Rome.Langdon and Vittoria Vetra (Ayele Zurer), one of the lead scientists involved with the explosives, race around Vatican City and Rome to find the cardinals and the device before time runs out. Howard takes us on a labyrinthian ride through archives, catacombs, and churches to try and stop the Illuminati from destroying Vatican City.Puzzles, symbols, and history take up most of this film, culminating in a thrilling journey that will have you guessing until the very end. Hanks will keep you engaged with the story and his supporting cast is not so bad either with Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skargard, and Armin Mueller-Stahl.Unlike Da Vinci, this isn't nearly as controversial and is more a work of fiction. There is a message being sent that science and religion should work hand in hand and whether or not faith is something you earn or learn, but it really downplays the story and that is the best part. There is a pointless monologue that McGregor's character gives to the conclave in the Sistine Chapel. What he should be saying at that time isn't said and he goes on about religion and science, at a time when he should be worrying about the bomb that is about to go off and so forth.There were times when I thought certain characters knew more about something than they should have (like Vittoria). I also would have liked a little more background on Langdon. They touched upon it but I think more would have been nice. Some parts of the story that were a bit too ridiculous as well (a portion of the ending made me think ""Are you kidding me?""). All that said, I thought the story with all of its twists and turns was enjoyable. It isn't perfect, but it kept my attention, which is exactly what Howard was intending to do.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

I was sure that I would be like where did that come from, or who is that person. But they done a really good job at not referencing the other movie very much.One thing that I didn't like was it almost seemed like the Catholic Church sponsored the movie, and me not being catholic it was hard to follow along with some of the traditions.There were so many twist and turns and just not expecting what was going to happen next.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Could have been better,"This is a movie i was quite excited about. I loved the book for its intricacy and the fact it kept you guessing.Now while i knew what to expect from the film, as yes, it did follow the flow of the book pretty much perfectly, it left out crucial parts of the plot, things which thickened the narrative and made for more dramaitc plot twists. I felt a lot of Vittoria's plot line was left out, and this let me down, as her storyline provides the crux of the book (mostly).All in all, it is an enjoyable movie, it sure as S*** did not feel like 2+ hours as it moves with good pace and flow, but when it says ""Based on the novel by Dan Brown"" it really means loosely based. I still fail to see why movie makers cant stay truer to source material, Peter Jackson proved it can be done with LOTR, and such widely accepted books like Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons which have a great fan following, the films should be far more reflective and true to the books.Good movie, but could have been better",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The injection of pace and energy makes it much better than the first film even if it is only ""reasonably good""","The Pope has died and the four favourites to replace him have been kidnapped by someone who threatens to kill them one by one. Meanwhile a canister of anti-matter (the ""God particle"") has been stolen from the CERN project – a canister that is not only highly destructive if used incorrectly but also will becoming increasingly unstable and eventually cause great destruction at midnight. Those behind these crimes claim to be the Illuminati, the organisation of science that was thought to have long since been destroyed. The nature of the mystery and the pressure of time causes the Vatican to turn to measures they would not have considered in any other situation – bringing in Professor Robert Langdon to lead the race against time.The sequel to the Da Vinci Code was not something that particularly appealed to me given that I struggled to care or even stay awake through that first film. Angels & Demons though manages to address some of the key problems with the first film – although it cannot address them all because of the source material. What I mean is that it cannot make the plot into something that seems less silly than normal and the storyline does feel a little daft at times. What helps both the film and the plot is the biggest and best improvement that the makers have made – the pace. Where the first film was full of seriousness and worthy to the point of tedium, this film has energy and pace to it that makes the whole thing seem a lot more interesting than it is.We race from clue to clue, we have action sequences and so on and the speed to it helps cover up the weaknesses in the plot, with talking minimised to what is required to have the next running sequence. This is a bit weaker than one would have hoped though, because it does give the film a very episodic feel at times – with a talky bit, then speeding cars and action, then a bit more talking and then more running. Despite this though, it does work pretty well as long it is doesn't hang around too long between action parts and doesn't spend too long on serious religious imagery. When it does do this it flags surprisingly quickly and does start to feel a little heavy but Howard wisely keeps this from happening too often, making it more accessible and with the air of a more enjoyable film.The cast work with this well enough. Hanks spends more of this film doing a traditional ""action hero"" type role with lots of shouting and less theorising – perhaps to the annoyance of some but it is what the film calls for. McGregor is so-so here, his accent is odd and his character clear but he is another star in the film so taken as such by me. Zurer fills the Tatu role with not a lot to do or offer beyond her easy looks. Skarsgård, Mueller-Stahl and others give their usual performances to good stead but this is never an actors film so much as that of Howard. As director he doesn't exhilarate but he is a professional man with a lot of resources so he makes the film look good and uses the camera well to provide pace – hardly Bourne stuff but still good.Angels & Demons is an OK film, which may not sound like praise but it does represent a real improvement on the dreadfully dull first film. It has the same core problems but the pace covers a lot of other sins and makes the film feel more engaging and exciting than it probably should have done. I'm not sure I want a third film in this mould but this sequel at least manages to raise itself to be ""reasonably good"", for which it (sadly) deserves mention.",,Anonymous,Mystery

"A thrilling action flick, that improves on ""The Da Vinci Code""","--Some minor spoilers, skip the part that describes the plot if you don't want to know anything about it--Angels and Demons, Good and Evil, Science and Faith. The title of the movie adaptation of Dan Brown's novel from 2000 allows for many interpretations, literally and figuratively. But the real question about the film is whether it overcame the demons of its predecessor ""The Da Vinci Code"", which was panned by critics, despite becoming a huge financial success. Ironically ""The Da Vinci Code"" was much more popular in its printed form than ""Angels and Demons"", but yet the later one turned out to be the better film.From the CERN Laboratories in Switzerland a canister containing a new, dangerous substance called anti-matter is removed and the head scientist brutally murdered. After the death of the pope and on the day of the Conclave, where the cardinals come together to elect the new head of the Catholic church, the four favorites for the post are kidnapped. Robert Langdon, a professor of symbology, is called upon by the Vatican to assist them in their search of the four cardinals, because they have received a disturbing phone call, indicating that a secret and supposedly extinct group of scientists that refer to themselves as the Illuminati are responsible. Together with Vittoria Vettra from CERN and Captain Olivetti he tries to find the cardinals by following a path of illumination, that leads to four churches in Rome and eventually to the headquarters of the society. Meanwhile the Camarlengo, Cardinal Strauss and the commander of the Swiss Guard, Richter, are faced with the annihilation of the Vatican, as the vile with the antimatter has been hidden somewhere deep in the city and will go off at midnight. A race against time begins and more than ever loyalty and faith have to come together for a war that might end in the total defeat of the Catholic Church.While the movie version of ""The Da Vinci Code"" followed the book very closely, Ron Howard made a number of changes to ""Angels and Demons"", most of them for the better. He rewrote some of the characters and could therefore even cross out some of them completely, the most vital one being Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN. Characteristics and certain dialog scenes were also shifted, something that might confuse those who read the book recently, but for those who did a long time ago, it will hardly be important. Indeed, there are some bigger differences, but pretty much all of them improve the plot, and take out some major flaws of the book. The pacing of the movie is also better than its prequel, with a lot more action and less talking, which makes the 140 minutes go by very quickly.Tom Hanks, who once again plays the role of Robert Langdon, is more involved this time, doing a lot of running and always being in the center of things. That does him a lot of good, because he gets the chance to actually show some of his acting talents, and serve as more than just the person who has to tell the audience the historic trivia that the viewer needs to follow the plot. Kudos also to Ewan McGregor, who gives a very strong and emotional performance as the Camerlengo. He's very believable in his role and like Tom Hanks has a very strong presence on the screen. Ayelet Zurer on the other hand doesn't get very much to work with, and her best scene once again brings the typical church motive of women not being trustworthy to the top. Pierfrancesco Favino as Olivetti and Stellan Skarsgard as Richter both do a really good job, especially the later one as the grumpy leader of the Swiss Guard, who frequently complains about Langdon's old-fashioned and supposedly naive methods of finding the kidnapper of the cardinals. We also see Armin Mueller-Stahl as Cardinal Strauss, a relatively minor role, that he still manages to play great. Interestingly enough ""Angels and Demons"" has less well-known cast than ""The Da Vinci Code"" but at most times features better performances.Due to the controversial status of Dan Brown surrounding the Catholic Church, the Vatican denied the permission to film ""Angels and Demons"" in the original churches in Rome. Anyway, the production designers did a terrific job recreating the interiors, with all the artwork and nostalgic charm you can only find in a place like that. Hans Zimmer's music is bombastic and powerful, making several scenes more exciting than they are anyway.It wouldn't be surprising if ""Angels and Demons"" became just as much of a hit as ""The Da Vinci Code"" which made $750 Million worldwide, despite negative reviews. The biggest flaws of the movie mostly come from the book already and if you enjoyed ""The Da Vinci Code"" already there is no doubt you will also like ""Angels and Demons"" which improved on its prequel without a doubt. It won't end up being a classic, but is still quite powerful, entertaining and a feast for the eyes. (3.5/5)A fast-paced, thrilling action flick, that does pretty much everything right ""The Da Vinci Code"" didn't and manages to entertain for its total running time, which after all is more than two hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It's better than Da Vinci Code,"It's better than Da Vinci Code (but Da Vinci Code was really quite bad). From an agnostic's standpoint, it is just an entertaining thriller. The pace was good and Ron Howard did a pretty good job as a director. Except for Ewan McGregor (one of his poorer performances), everyone else was alright. The only exceptional performance perhaps came from Armin Mueller-Stahl. Rome is beautiful and the night shots were quite stunning. There are certain parts of the show that appear to be totally illogical but that could be easily overlooked as the pace of the movie pushes you forward.Just enjoy the movie like you would have enjoyed X-Files or something of that equivalent.

This film is an example of profound imagination and hard work.,"This film is an example of profound imagination and hard work. Now almost all the imagination job has already been done by the author Dan brown whereas I am referring to the hard work done by the special effects personals. This movie could not have been possible without the visual effects that it shows. Thus by such conditions the real work of the director is narrowed down. He has just to assemble a cast and work on the plot.If I go on with the story than it would feel as if I am rating the book itself. And the ingenuity of the writer is clearly visible in the story. We are drawn again towards the ancient crypts and the fight of good against evil. The church had tried to hamper the scientific endeavors in the medieval age and now a secret scientific group wants to take retribution. They steal an antimatter capsule from the laboratory of CERN and try to implode the whole Vatican down with its cataclysmic power. As the story unfolds the various layers of corruption unveil themselves. The thrill is never ending and there is always a Shyamalan kind of twist waiting for us in the storyline. It was really exhilarating to watch. Tom hanks as professor Langdon tracks down the ancient crypts and takes us to new secrets. Art direction is superb and I wouldn't have thought a journey of Vatican like this in my life. Even the minute details are explicitly shown.Tom hanks does a nice acting job. We know that he can play his parts really well and in this movie, his role was not even challenging. Evan McGregor plays the camerlengo to the pope and his acting is also laudable.My favorite scene is when the antimatter blasts a thousand feet above the Vatican. The sky turns into a glorious nebula and for the audiences down on earth it would have surely looked like a godly work. There is a high level of depth in which this scene is shown. You can't figure out that these scenes were really created on computer. Gracious and highly inspiring.Direction – 65 Acting/ Casting – 75 Cinematography/photography -95 Musical score –60 Screenplay- 85",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Bernini Code,"A lead character sporting a better hairdo doesn't translate to a better conspiracy theory film as proved by ""Angels & Demons"", the follow-up to the ludicruous ""The Da Vinci Code"", where Tom Hanks reprises his role as the renowned symbologist in a race against time to follow clues and solve riddles to prevent a catastrophe from happening. Based from the first novel by Dan Brown to feature Harvard Professor of Symbology Robert Langdon (an Indiana Jones clone with less charisma), Ron Howard's second go at pseudo-erudite actioner succeeds only insofar as being consistent with its cinematic predecessor's mediocrity, with the age-old science-versus-religion theme depthlessly glanced at in lieu of the turgid plot and uninspiring chase scenes around the churches of Rome and Vatican City.Actually a prequel of ""The Da Vinci Code"" novel, the events in ""Angels & Demons"" is set after the events of the 2006 blockbuster where Langdon, now in antagonism with the Catholic Church following his Parisian saga, finds himself in the middle of another predicament when the Vatican summons him to help them in locating the whereabouts of the Illuminati, a supposedly mythical group of freethinkers that has vanished centuries ago but has apparently re-emerged shortly after the Pope's death to murder the four would-be successors to the Papacy, and blow up Vatican City in the process using an antimatter bomb stolen from the elite science lab CERN in Switzerland. With her is the obligatory female sidekick Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer), a scientist who worked on the bomb, and together they perfunctorily locate Bernini statues among the churches in the vicinity to save the Church from an old enemy.Lecturing and pontificating, ""Angels & Demons""' greatest fault nevertheless is not its ambivalence towards its contrasting themes -- despite being dealt so clumsily -- but in its underwhelming routine setpieces, as exemplified by its riddles so cursorily presented and hastily solved that they appear less the plot's selling point than mere reconsiderations to an otherwise by-the-numbers narrative that seems to take longer to go its obvious twist. Maybe Dan Brown has seen way too many classical art.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Not perfect but very entertaining, exciting, and suspenseful","As a huge fan of the book, I was really excited to see this movie. I read both this and The Da Vinci Code (which actually follows Angels & Demons) before the movie of The Da Vinci Code came out, and while the latter was the one that everyone was crazy about and was the really controversial one, I thought it was a disappointment compared to Angels & Demons, and while it was still a very good book, I wasn't all that impressed with the movie version, and I found myself thinking ""I hope they make a movie of Angels & Demons, I bet that'll be a lot better."" Well, looks like I got my wish! And I must say that while it inevitably did not QUITE live up to the book, I enjoyed it quite a bit more than The Da Vinci Code, and on its own I thought that, though not without its flaws, it was a very well done film.I was very impressed with the introduction of the film. They did a good job of presenting the two sides of the story, Religion and then Science, and then pulling you into the story. After that, the movie slowed down for just a little bit. It basically followed the same pattern as the book, it introduced the story and characters, and for a while had quite a bit of plot development to really build up what was going on. This was the main part that I thought could have been done a little better in the film. Not that it was done badly. The plot was presented well, and it was definitely interesting, but I felt like it just lacked a little bit of that cinematic feeling, it's hard to say what they could have added to it to make it better but I just felt like they could have made the plot events punch a little harder.However, the film doesn't drag for very long. Just like the book does, after the story is developed, it starts to pick up momentum very quickly and keeps you interested. I felt that they did a great job of giving you that suspenseful, time-is-running-out, race-against-the-clock feeling, the action is intense but not over the top, and the film stays tense and suspenseful until almost the very end.The ending didn't quite have as powerful of an impact on me as it did in the book, but that may just be because i had already read it and already knew the story. Though I had pictured them doing it a little differently, it was still presented well, and one particular shot near the end I thought was quite spectacular (not gonna give away any spoilers though).overall, other aspects of the movie were also quite solid. Good performances all-around (though probably none that will win any Oscars), great score from Hanz Zimmer, a few good chuckles of comedic relief here and there, etc.All in all, though it has room for improvement and is not perfect by any means, this is a very entertaining, exciting and suspenseful film, and a very solid adaptation of the book. a few plot points where changed but otherwise it stays very true to the book and was very fun to see unfold on screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Simply National Treasure for Intellectuals? A Pretty Good Straight-up Murder Mystery.,"This is a Boys' Own adventure for grown-ups pure and simple. Sure you can chuck in the mix a secret society and the Catholic Church, and that works better here than in Da Vinci, but at the end of the day this is a film with one premise: unravel some clues, defuse a bomb, and the obligatory twist. It's a watchable and enjoyable murder mystery with less of the pseudo-intellectual than Da Vinci and it really does look and feel like National Treasure for the over 30s.I was surprised at how much better the pacing and action are in this one, but disappointed at how little real sleuthing was involved. Many of the clues were solved by simply following the directions.All in all a surprisingly fun film (If fun is the right word for a murder mystery) with just enough philosophical musing amid the break-neck action and gruesome killings to justify your brain cells involvement.With excellent settings (Even though we all suspected a lot of computer wizardry) and with Ron Howard and Tom Hanks as always working well together this is good entertainment if a little popcorn.All in all: go for the plot and stay for the action.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

However, I was anxious to see what the movie would be like because I was not impressed at all with the Da Vinci code.

"A fun, easy to enjoy study of  science v. religion.","I didn't read the book Angels and Demons, but I had loved the Da Vinci Code, and I had enjoyed that movie, despite it's flaws. When I saw this film I was a bit more skeptical, but I was rewarded with a fun and fast paced thriller.The plot is, well, present, but not really important. This movie is much more about the structural hierarchy of the Catholic Church and the evolving relationship between science and religion than about any conspiracy, as was the case with the first film. The Illuminati are more of a distraction than anything else.If you are a nerd like me, then you will love the shots of the Large Hadron Collider; also every scene set inside the Vatican does a good job of portraying the inner workings of the Papacy without presenting it in an overly negative or conspiratorial light.About the only thing that surprised me was the level of violence present in this PG-13 movie. Two years ago the MPAA would have given it an R rating. This didn't bother me at all, but if you are at all squeamish or thinking of taking younger children, keep this in mind.All in all, this isn't the greatest film in the world, but it is one of those movies that really is better seen on the big screen.Michael",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Could have used a little research,"I'm a historian. This movie is so wrong it hurts. Tried to watch with an open mind, but if you're going to delve into a movie or anything for that matter of this nature at least do some homework regarding history, locations, church protocol, et cetera.

There are those of us out there that actually put on our shoes and venture out to the theatre when something of this nature, worthy of a theatrical release comes to town. A little research, all I'm asking. But then again, the book it's based on is somewhat of a joke in itself. So basically, they took a novel with many errors and decided to make it into a screenplay, pour millions and millions and millions of dollars into it and make an incredibly promoted world distributed theatrical release and at no time have anyone take the time to do a little research on the lot of it. I know several of my colleagues who would have done it for just the credit alone or at least given it to a body of students as an assignment for several weeks to research various aspects or just pay someone knowledgeable a couple of bucks just to run through it because trust me, there are plenty of starving historians out there who would have jumped on the opportunity if it had presented itself.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Dead Bishop in the Lobby!,"""Well, I don't know who keeps leaving them!"" Sorry, just recalled that old Monty Python sketch.

Fair enough, I guess, but honestly, a book is always going to be better than the movie. Also, Brown got so many things wrong in the book about Catholicism that the film makers probably did him a favor by making changes.Beyond that, it's a well paced film, good performance by Hanks.

"Same problems as ""The Da Vinci Code,"" but slightly better","If we learned anything from the film adaptation of ""The Da Vinci Code,"" it's that Dan Brown's best-selling religion-centered mystery novels don't translate into great films. Entertaining, sure, but great, no. The dialogue gets bogged down with historical explanation and the characters get little attention because there's simply no time with all the symbol decoding. But box office receipts are another story: ""Da Vinci"" fell just sort of earning twice its budget, so great film or not, there would be ""Angels & Demons."" Not surprisingly, this film suffers from the same deficiencies despite being a bit better.I have read both books and seen both movies and ""Angels & Demons"" the film is easily a notch better than its film predecessor. Unlike ""Da Vinci,"" focused on the mostly little known ideas of the sacred feminine, ""Angels"" is about the inner-workings of the Catholic Church, which requires considerably less audience educating than the sacred feminine. Writer Akiva Goldsman, who penned both Brown adaptations, doesn't have to waste all his time explaining the history/mythology as he did in ""Da Vinci"" ... only most of it.""Angels"" is more of a thriller and a tad better suited for film than ""Da Vinci."" This film is a sprint from start to finish, taking place in under 24 hours and its premise is very simple: 15 minutes in you learn that a legendary group of scientists from the 17th century who were persecuted by the church have risen again and threatened to kill four cardinals every hour starting at 7 p.m. and follow that up at midnight by exploding the Vatican with anti-matter - - unless Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) and an Italian anti-matter scientist (Ayelet Zurer) can stop them by decoding a set of ancient clues planted throughout Rome. The suspense comes much easier because they have to solve the clues on time or people die. ""Da Vinci"" was much less straightforward. This moves quick and is consequently more entertaining. It also doesn't hurt that the backdrop for the story is the stunningly beautiful Rome: it's more dazzling to watch.As for the problems being the same, Tom Hanks is yet again wasted talent. He has the Robert Langdon look and the reputation to bring in profits, but his character just has to sound like he knows what he's talking about and spit out mythology and history quick enough so that we can get on to the next scene. Of course Hanks does this well, but anyone could. These films just have no room to develop character or elicit any emotion from the audience. At least this time, Goldsman and acclaimed director Ron Howard don't even pretend like they can create catharsis and focus on making this film as fast-paced and thrilling as possible. They succeed here better than in ""Da Vinci"" and smart artists don't make the same mistakes twice.Viewers that read the books, saw ""Da Vinci"" and still didn't like ""Angels & Demons"" have no one to blame but themselves for giving in and buying tickets to see something proved not to translate well into film despite being in the hands of a master like Howard. Anyone who walks in and expects to at least be entertained by a mystery for 2 hours with no expectation of being as good of the book will find they get exactly what they paid for and maybe even find it was better than ""Da Vinci.""",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Angels and Demons,"the movie is not completely unfortunate. It is faithful to the book, in a nutshell, the music was over done, the special effects were fantastic and the acting even better. Although there are a lot of things very generic about the film, I enjoyed it richly. Ron Howard was not able to film in the Vatican and his studio substitutes were amazing. One massive problem I have with the movie is the idea that it does not add anything to the story to those who have read the book, I knew exactly when everything was going to happen, when the big musical numbers would begin, and I was able to guess pretty much every scene and set before it was shown on screen.What I most loved the film which makes it the difference between a rating of 6 and 7 is the facial expressions of Top Hanks especially at the end.

I believe in angels,"I was not really a fan of Dan Brown until Da Vinci Code was released. It left me wondering how did he come up with that story. When I heard about Angels and Demons it made me say ""I must see that movie"". And so I did. Hanks did a really good acting and the role was very impressive. He's a brilliant professor really trying to help without asking in return. For me, he played the role of an angel sent by God to search for the truth and make the people see who the real enemy is.

It just showed that it doesn't matter what your faith may be as long as you have the heart to truly save other people's lives.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Entertaining, which is all that I ask of it","Despite all the flaws with Dan Brown's writing style, Angels and Demons was a very entertaining piece of ""detective"" fiction. Where Da Vinci Code had many scenes of sitting around, sipping tea and discussing art, A&D had a much faster pace to it, which translates significantly better to the screen. The history aspect which DVC capitalized on is surely present, but to a somewhat smaller degree, allowing the plot to stand on its own two feet.Fans of the book should know it stays mostly true. Sure, you can whine about stuff like ""omg no guy in wheelchair"" or ""omg she was his daughter not his partner"", but the essence is definitely intact. One twist at the end is left out, but it felt forced anyways in the book, so I believe its best as is.Still has the weaknesses of the book, but is much better than its predecessor as it is less of the ""history"" lesson (note the quotes). Tom Hanks still isn't perfect, but he's learned some of his lessons from the last one. Overall, if it looks like the kind of thing you'd like, you probably will. If not, you won't.

Some points to take home from Angels and Demons,"1. Carmelengo wants to unite religion and science, or maybe let science take over religion.

All religions are flawed, like all human beings. Could we see religion as an individual human being? Its beauty, its character, its way of thinking, as well as its ugliness? 3. Religion and science - can they co-exist? New Carmelengo handing over Galileo's manuscript to Langdon - science to study religion. But can religion study science? 4.

"Predictable, edgeless","Ron Howard’s followup to The Da Vinci Code is an easy-to-follow, paint-by-numbers mystery thriller that probably would have received little recognition had it a) not been directed by Howard, b) not starred the redoubtable Tom Hanks, and c) used religion as its theme. All three elements contribute to form an overblown, frantic mess that offers little mystery.Robert Langdon (Hanks), the “symbologist” (not a real position) of The Da Vinci Code, is again the hero here, called into action by the Vatican itself, as four of its esteemed cardinals have been, um, cardinalnapped, just as an Conclave to choose the new Pope is about to begin. At the same time, an experiment at Switzerland’s CERN research center has produced a nifty new substance called antimatter - and it’s been stolen! By, it appears, whoever kidnapped the cardinal. The antimatter’s storage container must be found before midnight, or else the battery will run out, and everyone will be doomed.So it’s a race against the clock as Langdon and a beautiful CERN scientist (Ayelet Zurer) try to locate the container and save the cardinals. The mismatched duo - will they fall in love? - must match wits with some unseen wacko religious extremist, as well as the head of the Swiss Guard (Stellan Skarsgard). They’re helped by the youthful Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor), i.e., the Pope’s Helper fellow, and the chief of Vatican City’s police force (Pierfrancisco Favino) - or are they? The bad guy could be a good guy in disguise, right? Or did I just blow your mind? One thing that did bother me a lot about this movie - aside from the faceless, let’s-run-from-clue-to-clue plot device - is that for a movie that’s supposed to be peopled with Serious Folks who revere Important Things, sort of like Indiana Jones and his “it belongs in a museum!” mantra, there’s a LOT of desecration of religious artifacts, often for no good reason at all. Example: Langdon and his gal pal get access to the Vatican’s archives (of course they do) to look at one of Galileo’s original texts. The only one remaining in existence, right? In lieu of translating, they just rip a page out. Much light is made of the mysterious archives, and although I’m not remotely religious, this struck me as particularly disrespectful. Was Howard lampooning the Church, or was he trying to tell a good mystery tale? He succeeded only in doing the former, which is a huge disappointment.Hanks isn’t bad - better than he was in The Da Vinci Code, anyway - and his hair is less distracting here. He’s every bit as intrepid as you’d expect a Harvard professor to be in investigating a murder, which I’m sure is something that happens all the time to Harvard professors. Probably more than for Yale professors, anyway. So he’s not the problem, or even a problem. An issue, though, is that the characters are so thinly drawn. I mean, when you see two characters who seem a little dodgy, you know one of them will turn out to be not so dodgy, and maybe even a Good Guy after all. “Twists” like that can be spotted too far in advance for my tastes.If you took the core plot of “24″ and stripped away most of the tension and all of the character depth and added sacrilege, you’d get Angels and Demons. The book, as they say, is a heck of a lot better than the vapid movie version, but you probably assumed that anyway. What you might not have realized is that although this book was a lot better than the Da Vinci Code book, the movie is only marginally better than the DVC on film.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Like Professor Indiana Jones, he can wave the flag of the scientist no matter what plot machinations demonstrate before his own eyes. And the audience can disbelieve right along with him.One of the best story devices here is that the Vatican security office receives a live camera feed showing an anti-matter bomb that has ""artificial light"" on it so to find its location throughout the movie they shut down power to each section of Vatican City, one by one. What's not determined is whether the artificial light is A/C or D/C like the explosive device itself running out of battery power, nor how long the power needs to be turned off in each case before it can be seen on the security monitor (long enough to hold one's breath?), nor who remains in the security office to observe this, nor how they plan to view the monitor should they get around to switching off the power to the security office.Meanwhile the mastermind behind this multi-layered crime had made great leaps of faith. Of COURSE you can find a trustworthy thug to transport an unstable experimental substance (which will not exist until moments before its theft) across the world and then stand on it patiently. Of COURSE even though you are using the real anti-matter bomb and have placed it where it can destroy something that you want, you have calculated the correct influence of cold on battery power and you know within a second when it will die and how far away it must be to survive a matter-anti-matter contact explosion. Of COURSE you can invite an academic into a crisis that threatens tourists of Rome and expect that he will respect the Vatican's decision to keep Roman police out of it for fear of ""world media attention."" Of COURSE he will wade through the seemingly doomed crowds with full knowledge of a time-bomb and simply tell no secular cops because he's just that kind of respectful guy. Of COURSE it is also quite worthwhile to arrange your set-piece killings according to a puzzle with clues any whip-smart symbologist can follow in time to help facilitate and witness your grand finale. And of COURSE it is worth killing the highest-ranking priests you can find when the afterlife and judgment are uppermost in your psyche.They say an adventure is only as good as the villain's plan. In this case it is full of more holes than Swiss Cheese on the CERN lunch cart. I admit while reading both Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code I was turning the pages and feelin' smart since I knew and still know nothing about the Illuminati or secret societies and those books might either be a primer for a lot of us or the whole nut of our education on these matters. In book form, it was interesting as it unfolded. I fumed a bit about this or that, questioned some as a weather-beaten Catholic myself, but overall enjoyed the way plot points revealed themselves. I admit that the adaptation for the most part has likely made wise choices in omissions. One critic cited Langdon's joke from the book, ""Neutrinos have mass? I didn't even know they were Catholic."" But that glibness couldn't just be dropped into the life-and-death scenes that survive. Sometimes the time it takes to read a page rounds out an unlikely event that would be tough to take on screen. So I can't fault the adaptation and Ron Howard made as good a movie as can be made, but as a thriller trying to be just entertainment I don't think it will hold up to scrutiny. The entertainment value ends up being the tap-dance of Hollywood's nice guys Hanks and Howard in dealing with settings and issues that super-secular Hollywood holds in contempt. If you go to the movie interested in tracking that, then it's worth sitting through. But otherwise it will be all about why an unarmed scientist feels comfortable walking into dark abandoned buildings expecting to find a brilliant and powerful murderer.",,Anonymous,Mystery

Better Than Da Vinci Code,"Robert Langdon is back in the sequel that is based on the first book. This time Langdon is brought on to a case in the Vatican, there has been a murder. Langdon must help solve a bunch of riddles and clues to make sure a terrorist plot does not ensue.The Da Vinci code was met with unsatisfied reactions. Hank's hair was a big thing in the media and it overtook the film, since he was such a deadpan character in the first one. He fares a little better here, but it's still kind of ho-hum. The better book of the two is also the better film of the two. Angels and Demons has many problems and I almost forgot I even watched it today, which isn't a good sign. But it is tighter, has a better narrative and feels more suspenseful.There are tons of stuff missing from the film, as expected. The plot revolves around the capture four cardinals, Langdon must find them all and save them before they are executed every hour. The Illuminati are behind it, who have hired an assassin to kill each one using one of the four elements, earth, water, fire, air. Each one has the word branded into their skin. The clues in this one seem to flow a little better than Da Vinci and gone are the stupid CGI lettering techniques.The cast is weaker though, Ewan McGregor is a bore. Ayelet Zurer has no chemistry with Langdon and is weaker than Tautou. Stellan Skarsgård is really the only one who had my attention. He was more of an interesting character than the lead.The plot is predictable, even for people who have not read the book and the actions that happen on the screen are laughable sometimes. Specifically the stuck in the book records scene and the parachute scene. Both had me giggling while I rolled eyes and the lunacy.The production wasn't allowed to film in a lot of the Cathedrals, it is painfully obvious is a lot of the scenes. Sometimes I felt like I was watching a Star Wars movie it was so bad (the prequels, obviously). The assassin is nowhere as interesting as Silas, he was never given the chance to be. Important relationships are left out of the script and overall the film is really, like I said, forgettable.Despite all this, the film's rating reflects the good aspects of it. The Da Vinci Code got a 6 from me, so I can't give it that. 6.5 maybe, or a 7? It was certainly the better film of the two since they knew better the second time. Maybe these books just weren't made to be made for the screen? In any event, Angels and Demons is a mediocre film, with a decent rating from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Fascinating story, relentless pace make this a great watch!","Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), an expert on symbols, is called to Rome post haste. Although they are keeping things quiet, the authorities tell Langdon horrible news. The Pope has died and the four strongest candidates to succeed him have been kidnapped by a terrorist (Nikolaj Lie Kass). The assassin has declared that beginning at 8:00pm that evening, one of the Cardinals will be killed every hour on the hour, at area churches. It appears that the killer is working for The Illuminati, a group of scientists with a long history of war with the Catholic church, reaching back 500 years. As if that was not enough, the killer has stolen an ""anti-matter"" device which will be exploded at midnight and which will annihilate anyone within 20 miles of Rome. Ugh. Langdon works feverishly to unravel the mystery, with the help of the head of the Swiss Guard (Stellan Skaarsgard) and the late Pope's personal assistant, Patrick (Ewan McGregor). But, when 8 o'clock tolls, the Prof and his group reach the church a couple of minutes late to save the first Cardinal. How will they fare into the night? This is a very exciting and fascinating story with a relentless pace and a fine, fine cast. Hanks is truly great as the sardonic, nonreligious expert and McGregor succeeds in his meaty role of a troubled soul underneath an innocent demeanor. The supporting cast, although unknown to this viewer, are also very good, with special mention to Kass for his deeply scary role as the assassin. Naturally, the scenery in and around Rome is amazingly lovely and costumes, camera work and other film niceties are of the finest caliber. As for Howard's direction and the tantalizing story, they deserve much praise, for there is no time to catch one's breath before the next big event. On a humorous note, Howard has cast his father, Rance, in the role of a southern-drawl Cardinal and it is too, too funny. So, if you thought this was a flick to skip, do reconsider your decision. This one will fulfill any thinking man or woman's wish for a night of sound entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
good action thriller but not easy to follow without knowing the novel,"I didn't read the book and actually I wasn't supposed to as to understand the plot but in order to better follow it maybe it could have helped me. Angels & Demons is long but justifiably and never boring overall. The viewer is constantly wondering how the characters get to cram so much action, situations are a lot of times very unreal but the good cast (Tom Hanks and Ewan Mac Gregor especially) helps to keep the story entertaining.

Great Movie,"Just saw the movie and it's great... even better than the Da Vincci Code I would say. For those who read the book, it might be surprising and exciting to see it, nice opportunity to bring your imagination into ""reality"" and to give you the desire to read it again ! And for those who did not yet, I'm sure the first thought is: if the movie is so nice then how about the book, for me it's a good reason to read it. The pace of action was pretty amazing and the music was great. Tom Hanks was as expected the smart, funny and brave American expert! Few scenes are in some way chocking to see, but not that much. The story is also pretty nice, mostly because it's including many original monuments in Rome and in the Vatican Area. I would not expect too much critics as it was the case for Da Vincci even if I think that this time the issue is as important as the other one when it comes to questioning the Church faith. The final shot is amazing, It let me think for a while about the judgment day !!!",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Should have been better,"A few years ago there was The Davinci Code. In effect a fairy tale that played like an adventure through something that could have been reality. It sold well as a book and did fairly well as a film. Personally I liked the book a lot and the film a little. When I saw the trailers for this film I wanted to see this one too - even though I've not read its book. When the film started rolling I was regretting having made the choice of going to see this as this film is less than a shadow of the former one. Where Davinci Code keeps building on its backing story this one just jumps from one corner to the other and tosses its characters from the one to the other corner of unbelievable plot holes and standard twists and turns.All too predictable this one is another fairy tale. It is a rather bad one though - a fairy tale where everyone is sitting together from the start, actually trying to find out what role one is supposed to play out. When it finally ends it has bored for at least a good 30 minutes and there's no sympathy left for anyone anymore. Not the way a film like this should be IMO.4 out of 10 fractured stories",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An Honest Review,"It is actually better than ""The Da Vinci Code."" In the first movie...which actually takes place AFTER this one, the book is one cliffhanger of a chapter after the other. The chapters were short, the story formulaic, making for a book that everyone was bound to devour...It's just books like that don't seem to transfer right when you turn them into one movie. Had they made it into a miniseries, kept the chapter format, it would have been better.""Angels & Demons"" was a different beast. It wasn't as beautifully streamlined in its source material and as a result it translated a lot better into movie form.Not that the movie is great, it certainly has its flaws. It's just a better adaptation.Ewan Mcgregor does fine, Hanks, however, well, he didn't have much to work with. I mean, honestly he is playing the mother of all Mary Sue characters and that is just hard to act.Almost faultless and as a result, Hanks is stuck playing a fantasy character that is just too good at everything, someone who's only fault is that he is right all the time.It makes for a boring hero, which makes for a boring movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
After all... I enjoyed it!!,"By far, Angels & Demons is better than The DaVinci Code! Still, Ron Howard has repeated some of the latter's mistakes. The action-packed events and the information-stuffed script give no space whatsoever to other factors, such as performance and underlying themes, to arise. It is a fact that a lot of directors face the usual problem of fitting a rich bulky novel into a two-hour movie. However, many of them have managed to overcome such a problem apparently, Howard is not one of them. This leads us to the fact that Angels & Demons' success over The DaVinci Code is attributed to the excellence of the novel itself.Regarding cast and performance, again, I think Tom Hanks is a tragic miscast as Robert Langdon! Hanks is a great actor, and he is one of my favorites, but I just can't see him as heroic symbologist Robert Langdon. Besides, he showed nothing of his acting brilliance, for all he has done in that movie is raising his eyebrows and trying to look astonished all the time! Ewan McGregor, or Camerlengo Patrick McKenna to be honest, I expected more from him! But, I don't want to sound too judgmental, I think this is due to the script's flaws; there wasn't enough space on paper for the extremely important and deeply complicated character of the Camerlengo. Thus, McGregor couldn't fully bring it to life on screen. As for Nikolaj Lei Kaas (the assassin), he successfully and masterfully makes his debut in the American movies' scene, for I think that his performance was really applaudable, reminding me of the terrific performance of Paul Bettany as Silas in The DaVinci Code. Stellan Skarsgård, as Commander Richter, stood out as well.One of the things that I also liked about the movie is the soundtrack. The orchestral symphonies reflect the holiness and grandeur of the setting, and they manage in some scenes to give you goosebumps! The visual and special effects were quite lame for a movie like this. In some shots, things don't seem real at all and you feel as if you are watching a state-of-the-art video game.Finally, Angels & Demons is certainly an enjoyable experience, especially if you are not familiar with the novel, and the twists and turns of the plot.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"entertaining plot, made sense","I thought this was an entertaining movie, even if the whole antimatter plot point was a little absurd. The Vatican brings back symbolist Robert Langdom at a time of crisis. The pope has just died and the 4 cardinals that were the leading candidates to take his place have been kidnapped. An ancient society called the Illuminati has threatened to kill 1 cardinal every hour starting at 8 and they have stolen the antimatter and hid it in Vatican City and it is due to explode before midnight. As in the Di Vinci Code, Langdom uses clues associated with the various churches in Rome to find out where each cardinal will be executed. Langdom and the police run all over Rome being just a little to late to save the first 3 cardinals lives.Then there is a twist with the bad guy being one of those closest to the pope. What I don't get is why did he hide the antimatter where he was because if Langdon hadn't figured out in time where it was, he would have been blown up too. And are we supposed to believe he had the whole save the day with the helicopter carefully planned out from the beginning.FINAL VERDICT: It's actually a movie that has a plot. It's good enough to keep your interest till the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
What a Shame!,"Potentially I think if the film was set out and directed as the book portrays, this film could have been one of the best and most exciting films ever made. Unfortunately the film looks as if the directors and producers bought the cliff notes from the library and made the film on that.To be honest i am actually half way through the book and managed to get hold of a copy of the film and gave in to watching it. Luckily I stopped watching the film after 15mins so I still don't know how the story ends and will carry on reading the book. Within 5 minutes of the film I had got as far as I am in the book.When you read a book you can imagine exactly how it would look like if it were made into a film but within the first 5 minutes every perception I had was completely changed. The first part of the book is extremely important when Langdon goes to CERN meeting Kohler and Ms Vetra being none the wiser about her father. IT SETS THE SCENE!! and they have missed all off it.I would love to see a remake of the film but I'm sure its very unlikely. I would be happy if they completely re-made the character Robert Langdon with an unknown actor and started again from scratch because, although I enjoyed the Da Vinci Code (film), for the sheer brilliance of the book I think someone could have done a lot better with it and potentially made one of the most interesting and exciting set of films within recent years. Dan Brown should feel hard done here (although I'm sure he's isn't short of a few quid after the book release), if the film had the right directors behind it and followed the book more thoroughly, Dan Brown would be sitting on a gold mine.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Factchecking Aside, A Pretty Good Thriller","Being neither a fan of conspiracy tales or particularly of the earlier novel ""The Davinci Code"", I was less than optimistic that I would become a big fan of this new effort by Ron Howard and Tom Hanks. So it was a bit of a surprise to find ""Angels and Demons"" is not a bad film at all. But it surely stretches credibility with its quasi- and at times pseudo-historic underpinnings. This is story-telling at warp speed; sometimes you want to have the film rewound for a few frames to verify what has been said by Tom Hanks' (as Roger Langdon).Langdon's frenetic pace to prevent killings of high priests in the Vatican is the meat of the story(s). Thrown in to crank up the action a little further is the theft of antimatter, of course of much interest to all. And there are outward and internal tensions caused by the Swiss guard, Vatican figures gathered to select a new pope also have in- and external issues. And then of course there arethe Illuminati.With all these characters embroiled in catching a serial killer (who focuses on highly-placed priests) working for who-knows-who, we have the makings of a pretty good thriller. And if you can decipher Langdon's rapid-fire explanations as to why the pursuit should be conducted his way, you are ahead of his law enforcement colleagues.There are two exceptions, naturally. Langdon's physics-oriented partner – involved initially with the theft of antimatter she had a hand in developing (Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria Vetra)- quickly demonstrates a remarkable knowledge of Church history. Ewan Mc Gregor, who is acting essentially as the acting Pope, also understands seems to understand what is going on.The fun is in listening to Langdon's rapid delivery of his analysis of the crime scenes and the criminal, and how and why it is all tied together. There are a number of so-called facts spouted that may or may not be true; but that is to be expected in both the novels of Dan Brown and the subsequent films.The opening shots of the film are right on the money, conveying a real sense of the inner workings of a lab specializing in quantum physics. Credit this work to the director; Ron Howard does know how to make a film.Three Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Now, I don't think this is a great film by any stretch but it is a very enjoyable and exciting thriller. It is one of these disposable thrillers that you watch on a boring day.

The Philosophy and insights about Ancient Truths and Spiritual deception are bandied about with Folks on the run, getting in and out of cars, and pointing a lot here and there. ""What direction is that? South I think.""This is where the Movie mostly fails to be anything more than a very contrived piece of Fluff masquerading as deep stuff.

I also did not like the movie's portrayal of the chamberlain, he is a much deeper character in the book.

The best aspect of this film is the light it shines on a corrupt church.,"To be honest, there is not much to say about ""Angels and Demons"" in terms of the film itself. Based on the Dan Brown book of the same name, the follow-up to ""The DaVinci Code"" is a fine action film that throws Robert Langdon back into Italy to solve a very conveniently-put-together mystery concerning the Illuminati to save the Vatican.The story runs like a locomotive, with great effects and just fine direction from Ron Howard and Tom Hanks' return in the role of Langdon is, as well, just fine. The film sort of runs on autopilot and it's an entertaining ride.However, the great thing about this film is how it truly does shed a crystal-clear, bright light on how truly ridiculous and corrupt the Catholic church really is. The church apparently didn't have much to say about the film upon its release as they stated it was ""harmless entertainment"" while the President of the Catholic League stated ""Enjoy the movie, but know that it is a fable."" Their nonchalant nature spoke volumes.No doubt, much of what the film shows is based on truth, I have no doubt. As all religions have already been disproved a hundred times over by science, the Catholic church and its corrupt politics and horrifying popes are no doubt worried about that one moment when science actually crosses over and disproves the Bible once and for all with no way of covering everything up again and shoving it into the archives.So, the film is fine, but the light cast upon the Church is brilliant, and for that, I thank you, Mr. Howard, even if these sorts of lights apparently just continue to merely blind people instead of showing them the truth.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Extended Cut Review,"After the pope's death, a nefarious organization stashes an antimatter bomb somewhere in the Vatican, threatening to annihilate the conclave of cardinals who are meeting to elect the papal successor. To pass the time until the bomb will detonate, the enemy begins to torture and kill a few of the individual cardinals, but there is a pattern to the grotesque executions, involving hidden sculptural symbols and secret architectural clues. Unfortunately for the church, the man most capable of deciphering the code is the American ""symbologist"" Robert Langdon, who happens to be an affirmed atheist.A+D is how every sequel should be: The filmmakers found the flaws in the first film and fixed them, making the sequel better. Almost everything is improved in this sequel: The slow pacing in the first film is tightened so much that the filmmakers had the actors talk while walking/running to different locations. Hans Zimmer's underscore in the previous film is now much more blatant and epic, which can keep anyone with ears awake. Even Tom Hanks' hair is less annoying. However, the storyline is still as outrageous and ludicrous as the first, but that's a given if you've read the books written by Dan Brown.Now judging the film on its own aspects, A+D is a well made time-ticking thriller. After an unnecessarily long forty-minute set up, the ball starts rolling and you're sitting in a roller coaster ride that doesn't let up until the climax. I found the film very exciting and suspenseful and it was nice to see some great monuments and statues around Europe. Having only seen the extended cut of the film, I was surprised by how violent the film is, but I say that as a compliment. I think the film benefits with more blood and violent images that give the film a much more mature viewing than other PG-13 action flicks.Tom Hanks returns as the main role and he's just as good as the first film, although he looks a bit older. His new partner, Ayelet Zurer, is good enough for the role she's playing, although she seems to disappear for a while in the middle of the film. Ewan McGregor gives a good performance with his Irish accent, although it wasn't spectacular. I also liked Hans Zimmer's score, which gives the orchestra something more to do compared to the first film.As a sequel, A+D is better than THE DA VINCI CODE in almost every category ever invented. As a thriller, it's a suspenseful thrill ride from beginning to end. The scenery for the film is wonderful and the third act is amazing. If I had one complaint for the film, it was the oh-so-obvious twist ending which anyone could see a mile away if they paid attention. Still, what else could you ask for in a popcorn flick?",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
at parity with 'The Code',"I belong to a small and well-famed minority. I like Dan Brown's novels and I declare it openly. Yes, I came out of the closet as they say. I liked 'The Da Vinci Code' book (not so much the film) and I said it. I was immediately buried under tons of sarcasm, irony, pity. What can I do? Historical mysteries are one of my preferred genres since I read Jules Verne's books or Constantin Chirita's 'Ciresarii' (Romanian speakers may know what I am talking about).'Angels & Demons' the book was written before 'The Code', but the movie comes after, so there is no need to explain too much about the expertise of professor Langdon (Tom Hanks) or why he is called to solve historical mysteries with religious symbols implications. It's good that it's so, because the last thing the script in this film has is credibility. Yes, I enjoy historical riddles, but they need some plausible justification to be inserted in the script, and this justification lacks here completely. Luckily I buy easily the conventions of such movies, so I sat back in my chair and enjoyed the action, which is a combination between James Bond and '24' with Rome and papal intrigues replacing Los Angeles (or New York in the last '24' season) and the US presidency, but with corpses popping up each round hour. Moreover, seeing again the beautiful setting of the streets of Rome one and a half month after my last days of vacation there was also cool.This certainly does not make enough for a great film, or even for a great action film. My main problem with Ron Howard's 'Code' was the fact that he turned the great actors that are Hanks and Tautou unto just good but not very interesting actors. Here Hanks still looks at least as amazed to be in this movie as his character is to be in the middle of all this action, while his partner is now the Israeli actress Ayelet Zorer, which I respect very much for other roles, and I am happy that she got such an opportunity to play with Hanks in a blockbuster but I do not think that they let her use it too well. Maybe in the next film in the series Hanks will be more lucky with a partner to be of interest to him :-) Overall, not a bad action film, not the best either, at parity with 'The Code'.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Definitely better than 'The Da Vinci Code,","Started watching this movie, i personally had expectations of thrill and unfolding mystery in the offing. It sure did justify itself on all those grounds. It is starkly different from its predecessor 'The Da Vinci Code' which was too much information in very less time. It would not be wise to go for theatrical version of it and I would highly prescribe renting a DVD and do a 'sit back and watch'. Also, this would not take much of 'rewind and replay' as The Da Vinci Code demanded. In short I would say; its a good whodunit and you would enjoy watching it.One thing i could not digest; In the movie, it was told that antimatter explosion could create explosion and consequences similar to that of a nuclear explosion. But in the end when explosion actually happened, though it was very high in the air, it did not do much.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Seems rushed,"It's hard to try and put an entire book into one movie, and that's why Angels and Demons seems rushed and contrived/confusing at parts. However, this film actually improves some parts of the book - which was impressive. It's an enjoyable movie, but probably only if you enjoy Dan Brown's books in the first place.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Same failures as ""the Da Vinci Code"" film","I watched this movie after reading the book. The main enjoyment I derived was recognizing scenes and lines from the book. Without that, this movie would not have been a remotely interesting watch.I think it had all the same problems that the Da Vinci Code movie adaptation had. First, it ignored crucial elements of the book (like the romance, the assassin's cruelty, and key background info). It also changed up the characters a lot, in a very unnecessary way. The ultimate villain reveal isn't satisfying because of all the character changes they made.Second, it stayed a little too true to the book in terms of storyline. The book is very information heavy, and a lot of it involves deciphering information and traveling from place to place. That works well for a novel, but does not necessarily translate well to a screen. I like reading about things, but I don't really want to watch characters stand around and talk about them. The movie should've taken fewer liberations with the characters, and more with the plot. It gets boring fast because they didn't adapt the storyline to a film format.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"The film is superior to the predecessor structurally, debating science and religion without taking a side","Angels and Demons is a crescent of action only, two hours of music going up, running and a lot of tension. The vents don't work and the production just seems too high. There are no less than six climaxes in a row - one for each cardinal, plus the bomb and the final chase - resulting in exaggerated fatigue. After being introduced to the main characters of the plot and their basic motivations, we are thrown into that same rush made in the previous film.
The plot is very interesting and addresses in a very didactic way - as is the custom of Brown - the whole ritual of the Catholic Church through the death of the Holy Pope and breaks down the conclave, a meeting held to decide who will be the replacement for the chief of the church. At the same time, scientists realize something spectacular and create antimatter. In other words, they become creators of life, something that runs counter to all the principles of the Catholic religion. The problem starts when this antimatter is stolen and the ""preferetti"" (the favorites for the position of Pope) are kidnapped.Structurally speaking, Angels and Demons are superior to their predecessors. This time, the script, written by Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp, develops the plot more calmly, presenting the facts gradually and allowing the audience to assimilate all the past information. Furthermore, the story itself is more engaging, since Langdon finds it more difficult to solve the problems ahead of him, even failing in some. Another positive factor present in the feature is the constant feeling of doubt in the mind of the audience, making all characters, with the exception of the protagonists, being suspected of being behind the attack on the Vatican, including the cardinals themselves.More than the plot itself, the most interesting factor of the film is the dispute between science and religion discussed here. Instead of taking a side in the debate, Howard prefers to insert a conciliatory tone in his work, showing that it would not be impossible for the two areas to complement each other. The feature also features an anti-conservatism discourse that fits perfectly with the topic addressed, showing that this type of thinking delays not only technological advances, but also that of the religions themselves. Incidentally, the villain's motivations in the story are all based on fanaticism, serving as a beautiful parallel of current times. Despite the friendly tone, the film also does not exempt the religion from some flaws, unlike The Da Vinci Code which seemed to further confirm the power of the churches. Therefore, the work highlights the manipulation made by the Catholic Church to hide some facts, in addition to clearly addressing the persecutions made by Catholics against various scientists of antiquity, showing a certain courage in addressing themes that were not present in the previous feature. This change in the franchise can be exemplified by Robert Langdon's own actions. While in the past story the professor wanted to hide some facts from humanity so as not to shake people's faith, here he says to a cardinal that he will write about his religion, but he will try to be kind, in addition to telling the camerlengo that he does not believe in God.As for the cast, the film again fails to give its characters the deserved prominence. After all, who is Robert Langdon A very intelligent and rational symbologist. That's what we got from him. We don't know if he pays his taxes correctly, we don't know if he's divorced, if he cheated on his wife, if he likes to play cards, etc. Brown or Howard did not bother to give essence to his character, who enters and leaves the scene. Their companions follow almost the same pattern. Beautiful, of course, but little used. Audrey Tautou faces the sentence of being a passive listener of all the information Langdon has to give. And that is exactly what happened to the Israeli Ayelet Zurer who interprets physics Vittoria Vetra, a scientist who knows all the workings of antimatter and its container. Because of this, she accompanies Langdon on his endeavor. The fatal tone and all the love tension between Langdon and her, which existed in the book, were cut off in the film, leaving practically nothing interesting in the character. Even his most plausible motivation in the book has also been wiped out, which is the murder of his father, a scientist who tries to prevent the theft of antimatter. In the film, the dead individual is mentioned with little regret by the girl and is replaced by a scientist priest who is a friend of hers.The most complex, and obviously the most instigating ""persona"" in the film, is the Carmelengo played by the competent Ewan McGregor. Adopted as a child by the holy Pope, who has just passed away in the plot, the character Carlo Ventresca (name changed in the film for Patrick McKenna to justify the entry of a more renowned non-Italian actor to the project) is a fortress of serenity and understanding, even that shot down by the death of his ""father"". He is an important aid to Langdon, but his stance on Church canons and traditions sometimes bothers older members. This individual has a lot of depth, the only problem is that he stars in the most unlikely scenes in the film, even though Howard has softened the fantastical content of some.As for the film adaptation, Angels and Demons is less faithful than The Da Vinci Code. Screenwriters David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman, aiming to give more rhythm to the plot and specially to create the suspense. Several changes are made, some necessary, others not so much. Forget the character Maxmilliam Kohler, the scientist at CERN, he was simply taken out of the plot. Like Leonardo Vetra, in his place was Silvano, a mere scientist and collaborator of Vittoria who was also murdered for the same reason as the book. Gunther and Chinita are also despised.Ron Howard presents a much safer direction work, using various ambiance plans, open plans and counterplans that highlight all the beauty and grandeur of the Vatican and Rome, in addition to favoring the architecture of the buildings. The photograph still makes an interesting shadow play, showing the brightest external locations and the darkest environments inside the Vatican, highlighting how everything there is secret, giving a mysterious aura to the film. But the technical highlight is in charge of the production design that perfectly presents different environments of the Vatican, with the help of the special effects that built different places through digital resources. Always involved in a lot of controversy - a key element of Dan Brown's success -, the film received no support from the Vatican, obviously. This forced the production to work even harder, because, following the story to the letter, the team would have to film in several churches in Rome, a right that was denied in most locations. Even so, in a statement, the Catholic Church praised Howard's direction, but said the work was short-lived.
The direction wisely uses the great soundtrack of the master Hans Zimmer (who also composed for The Da Vinci Code) to create tension and drama. The soundtrack, in its most sinister moments, is reminiscent of some classic operas such as ""Lacrimosa"", by Mozart, or even ""O Fortuna"", an excerpt from ""Carmina Burana"" by the German composer Carl Orff. Already in a milder format, it brings irresistible musicals that grow and serve to focus the public's attention on Langdon's discoveries. Both in The Da Vinci Code and in Angels and Demons, the German composer presents two of his best works.Ron Howard failed in The Vince Code, a weak film and totally out of what was shown by Dan Brown, ended the cleverness and the brightness of the plot, a just regular adaptation, with an incredible technical part, but flawed script. Howard dares to come back and practically click on the same button, but he hits it hard this time, because Angels and Demons is not, and is far from being, a faithful adaptation, but how film works. Howard removes the situations from the pages of Brown's book with great skill for the screens, it gets to be astonishing certain scenes, where most are external and are done with such dedication and competence. Anyone who has read a book will love what was done in the film, the scenes facilitate the understanding of the book, everything seems perfectly done according to what was described by Dan Brown. The churches, the paintings, CERN, the Vatican, all reproduced in the best possible way.Of course, Angels and Demons could have been more audacious on certain topics, preferring a conciliatory tone that may upset some people, but the approach is far superior to its predecessor. In addition, the film features a safer work by Ron Howard, who, while not bringing a memorable work, at least features a feature that very efficiently entertains. Changes aside, there will be plenty of suspense, a lot of symbology, research, unraveling mysteries, action and a surprising ending.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
When the Vatican is fun.,"Langdon is back and this time he's in Vatican, where a secret society, the Illuminatti, are threatening the cardinals and the city. To be brief, Angels and Deamons is better than The DaVinci Code mainly because it's more fast-paced, it's full of disturbing facts and there's more action.The cast isn't anything special, the only two actors who stand out are Ewan McGregor and Tom Hanks, who improved his acting a tad since DaVinci. Ayelet Zurer, who plays Vittoria Vetra, is on the blacklist: her acting is nothing spectacular and her character is useless, mainly because she contributes little to the actual plot.The movie does have its share of weird moments, corny lines and so on, but it's entertaining, a must see for fans of The DaVinci Code.Final Score: 3.5/5 or 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

True disappointment,"I have been a true fan of Dan Brown's books for some time now, and I sincerely looked forward to this movie as much as I did with the ""Da Vinci code"". The thrill I had reading them, the shear detail of the books as well as the nerve racking turns in the end made them jump high up in my top ten books of all time. I couldn't wait, and I followed the production from the start!Alas, as with the ""Da Vinci Code"" I was disappointed even from the first minutes. Now, I did not expect the movie to be completely like the book, and I of course knew some minor details would have to be taken out, but come on! It is like they took the book, ripped the pages apart and just scrambled the film back on random. There were such moments in the book that I was looking forward to that had just been taken out and tossed out the window. The start was different, the middle was different, the story was different.. Even the characters were different. There were some quotes that I actually got chills from while reading the book, and to be honest, it's a freaking book. It's not supposed to give me those sensations. A movie maybe, but a book? No no. But since I did get this sensation of awe, I was sure it would be multiplied by a tenfold in the movie.I got chills once. And that was when it said the title at the start of the movie. For me this movie was true disappointment.You may flame me all you like, but Mr. Howard, you have already ruined two books for me. Don't ruin another now. These were my thoughts on the movie, and I am sure someone else loved it. If so good for you, if not, I completely understand.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It could have been worse,"Well at least they didn't make a complete mess of it like last time. Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman previously combined for the film adaptation of Dan Brown's novel The Da Vinci Code. The film was a total dud. A thrilling, exciting novel was transformed into a dull, plodding movie. Howard and Goldsman, with a second screenwriter in David Koepp along for the ride this time, try again with their adaptation of Brown's Angels & Demons. This time the film is not a total dud but it's certainly not all you would hope for it to be either. Once again it is clear that the book is better than the movie. A lot better.Tom Hanks, with a much better haircut this time, returns to the role of Robert Langdon and Hanks certainly seems more comfortable here than he did in his first Langdon adventure. Hanks as Langdon works fine, it's everything around the film's star which is hit or miss. Where the last film got bogged down with a lot of talk and historical information this film has a much better pace to it. Less talk, more action. So that's good. But in all the breakneck action, with Langdon scurrying to and fro across Rome, a lot of the original story from the novel has been lost. That's not so good. If everything from the novel had been included here we'd probably be looking at a movie that's five hours long. But some of the cuts which were made have cut a lot of the heart out of the story. There's really not much in the way of story left. It's just a frantic race against time and while there is certainly some excitement to be had you never find yourself nearly as invested in the story or the characters as you did when reading the novel. There were personal connections in the novel which added layers of emotion to the story. Here that emotion has been stripped away and what we're left with is just another action thriller. And the novel was so much more than that.The Da Vinci Code film had very little to recommend it, that's not the case here. Angels & Demons is passable entertainment. Hanks is much better this time around and he's supported well by some fine actors. Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo and Stellan Skarsgård as the head of the Swiss Guard stand out as being particularly memorable even as their characters have undergone some radical transformations from what Dan Brown put down on the page. Ayelet Zurer is fine with what she is given to do in the role of Vittoria Vetra. You just wish they would have given her more. In the novel Vittoria was a critically important character with a hugely significant role in the plot. Here it seems she's just along for the ride and that's a shame. The look of the film is undeniably impressive, as Rome beautifully comes alive. Even the parts of Rome which were brought to life on a California back lot. It's an exciting film, we're given very little time to catch our breath as we race to what promises to be an explosive conclusion. There again you'll probably feel the book's ending works a lot better than the movie's does. But by that point you're resigned to the fact that Ron Howard's movie just wasn't going to measure up to Dan Brown's book. Someone who never read the novel could really enjoy this film for what it is. Those who read the novel can't help but be a touch disappointed, knowing what this film could have been. But this film is certainly better than The Da Vinci Code was. So that's something I guess. Better luck with The Lost Symbol, Ron.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
The Angels and Demons Code,"I find it so weird that this movie is the second in Robert Langdon's Hollywood saga, but the first in the book saga. I only read the third book by now, and I didn't feel like I was missing key information from the previous books, so I guess this is why the movie's order does not matter.If you are seeing this review, know that this is the second movie based on the first book. And I didn't read the first two books. We cool? Alright.Oh, and I'd like to remind you that if you care about historical facts and events, and get mad when they say something that is not accurate, then I think you are going to be pissed as you probably were when you watched (or if you watch)The Da Vinci Code (2006). I'm looking at this movie from the ""I want to be entertained"" perspective. I care if the movie was entertaining or not. This is not a documentary, so I didn't watch it to get facts. Now I think we are cool.We watch Langdon on his quest to find an antimatter container that can potentially destroy the Vatican in a cataclysmic explosion. All while trying to rescue four Pope-wannabees from the hands of a hitman hired by the Illuminati. Yeah, when Illuminati is involved, you know you are in for some good conspiracy stuff.This movie is basically a carbon copy of the first movie. This does not mean the movie is bad. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too. The difference is that now we are in the Vatican fighting a different group and watching different theories unfold.Is what you see in this movie true? I don't know. Does it really matter... If this is not a biography or a documentary, we can see it as fiction. In fiction, everything is valid. Dan Brown might say anything to make his work looks cooler and attract more viewers. I'm OK with that.Overall, cool like the first one. Nothing new other than new conspiracy theories and a different kind of threat. Recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Mystery

""" When you write about us and you will write about us, be kind as we are human ""","If you have read the dubious source which has become the basis for the movie "" The Da Vinci Code "" and this second addition which emerges as "" Angels and Demons "", you'll quickly realize the intricate nature of Ron Howard, the director. Having read the book, then watched the movie, I see the enormous segments of the literary track, were left out. Howard is a great director, as proof is seen in his past work. In this film however, there is a great deal lacking. Though it's not as complex as his 'Code' which drags the audience across countries, this one has the befuddled audience racing around Vatican city itself. Tom Hanks returns as Professor Robert Langdon a cryptologist who did not ingratiate himself with the Rome see in the first film, is reluctantly recalled by the same church to help solve the latest threat which calls itself the Illuminati. This secret group has kidnapped four important cardinals and promises to murder them for past sins of the church against the Intellectals brutalized in the past. Nikolaj Lie Kaas plays the assassin who stays well ahead of Hanks and physicist Vittoria Vetre (Ayelet Zurer) and Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård). With the complexity of a Physics problem, the movie is entertaining enough if you like crowds, racing sequences and threats of final annihilation. There is gratuitous drama, character suspense, combined with double and triple double-crossing, so much so one forgets who is fighting whom. As a result, this is an exciting movie for those who seek to leave the theater with heads spinning. But having read Dan Brown's juvenile books, they are baffling enough and it's not necessary to see his cryptic suggestions on the silver screen. ***",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A Visually Spectacular Thriller - with not a lo of respect for the audience,"ANGELS & DEMONS would work well as a silent movie - well, a silent movie with the musical score of Hans Zimmer in the background. Cinematographer Salvatore Totino offers us views of Rome and Vatican City, both from the exterior and from the historically significant interiors, that are as stunning as any on film. The actors look well and seem as involved as the creaky script by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman have pasted together from Dan Brown's first (in a probably endless line) novel allows about the derring-do of symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks reprising his role from The Da Vinci Code). But while the story is interesting - illuminating the Illuminati's centuries old plight to force the Catholic church to accept scientific reasoning instead of condemning it - and while Ron Howard as director does his best to give us a fast-paced thriller, the dialogue dumbs down the audience by the simplistic, hurriedly discovered answers to the meaning of symbols that drive this story. Dan Brown's novel gave the reader some breathing time to digest the ancient codes and incorporate them into the action: Ron Howard's film condenses the important findings in favor of emphasizing special effects and splendid footage of the inner chambers of St Peter's and the various churches that become destination points for the murders of the 'preferiti' cardinals gathered to elect a new pope after the surprise demise of the current pope.The cast includes some fine, interesting faces and actors - Ewan McGregor as the recently dead Pope's camerlengo, Stellan Skarsgård as the suspicious Commander Richter, a very beautiful but bland Ayelet Zurer as the sole female scientist Vittoria Vetra who understands the importance of rescuing the 'antimatter' that threatens the end of the church and a good part of the territory around Rome, Armin Mueller- Stahl as the crusty old Cardinal Strauss, Pierfrancesco Favino as the Inspector Olivetti, and the always fascinating character actor Nikolaj Lie Kaas as the assassin - but Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon rattles off his obsession with ecclesiastic symbology with such speed and nonchalance that the mysteries become almost insignificant to the audience who simply go along with the patter. It is a mad chase of a film, fortunately treating the audience to some wondrous scenery and lighting effects. As a film it is entertaining, but then that was the purpose of the book, too. It just feels like it not as fully realized a mystery as would be possible in different hands.Grady Harp",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty lousy movie with jerky camera movement,"There have been many comments on this movie so I need not say a lot. My chief complain is the jerky camera movement and close up shots. It appears that Hollywood directors are struggling to be able to provide a fast paced action filled drama in this age of short viewer attention spans, video games and the internet. So what do they do? They create an illusion of this by making the camera jerk a lot so that you get dizzy while watching the movie. The camera is also too close to the actors, almost like in their face.As some of the commentators have mentioned the movie is nothing but a grown up treasure hunt.

"""Angels & Demons"" Outshines Its Predecessor","It's an expectation that a successor has to exceed its predecessor. ""Angels & Demons"" is the sequel to the ""The Da Vinci Code"", even though the ""The Da Vinci Code"" book is published after the ""Angels & Demons"" book. I guess the producers redesigned this movie as a sequel. Well, this feels like a quasi-sequel. It's also great that this film outshines its predecessor.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is summoned by the Vatican to help them understand the symbols which are coming from the Illuminati, an old enemy of the Church. A CERN scientist, Vittoria Vettra (Ayelet Zurer) joins him to save four kidnapped cardinals and the entire Vatican from Illuminati's retribution.The film starts at morning, and the terror begins at 8pm. Every second matters for Langdon and his crew as lives are at risk. The pace is apparently faster than ""The Da Vinci Code"". It's impressive that most of the scenes are shot at studios and not in the Vatican, as the filmmakers are probably prohibited. Also, this feels like a film that pushes the PG-13, so watch out if kids are watching.

Not that Angels and Demons is bereft of plot; it suffers instead from a bountiful excess of plot that strains credulity—a naive, good-natured five-year-old will throw up his hands at regular intervals in ""no bloomin' way!"" disdain....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2009",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Excellent Movie...,"I watched Angels & Demons for the first time last night, and i found the film to be excellent. It starts off with the Roman Catholic Church mourning the death of Pope Pius XVI in Rome. Vatican City prepares for who will be the next Pope Until that time, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna, a papal court official and former helicopter pilot, takes temporary control of the Vatican. Reporters, nuns, priests, and other members of the Church crowd into Saint Peter's Square, waiting for the white smoke from the conclave, which signal who has been selected as the next pope. But the Illuminati, a 400-year old, underground secret society, kidnap the four most likely candidates before the conclave begins The Illuminati threaten to kill one every hour, starting at 8:00 pm, and then destroy the Vatican in a burst of light at midnight. I found the scenery to be amazing especially around Saint Peter's Square, I do not see why people do not like this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Angels & Demons,"I viewed this movie for the first time this morning at breakfast, at first I felt it had a movie with promise and I had heard from a family member that it was a lot easier to understand than the davinci code. I found it almost as difficult as the Davinci Code, I really like the acting in this film and the concept I am very uneducated in religion but I found it interesting and a fun movie for the most part. It definitely still had it's flaws though. I found it dragged on after about the 90 minute mark and they needed to make it more entertaining for the audience. the action was very good, the accents were portrayed as if i was in Rome. I am very hard on movies which is why this is only getting a 7/10. With that being said if you don't want to think that much I wouldn't recommend it.

"Save Your Time, Energy and Money","""Angels and Demons"" is simply a dreadful movie. You would be better off staying home to sort your socks or wash your underwear. If you desire entertainment and enjoyment from a recreation of the spiritual, rent ""Ghostbusters."" sit back, relax and enjoy a group of people making a film about angels and demons who know how to make a film about the topic.""Angels and Demons"" drags on forever. The writing is indescribably bad. The acting is reminiscent of young children acting out a space movie in their parents basement using ironing boards, toy soldiers, crayons, packs of matches for explosives and graduation gowns for the get-ups word by cardinals, priests and other members of the cloth.Even the special effects are largely lame. ""Independence Day"" and ""Men In Black"" are so much better effected and so much more interesting and fun. Really, honestly, avoid this film. Take up a new hobby. Or take a nap.

Token Italian semi - Hottie,"An EXTREMELY fast paced,exhilarating, interesting, detail rich book. Its a huge shame that the film had none of these qualities. not only was Tom Hanks' mild mannered portrayal or Robert Langdon Laughable, but the name changes to key characters, huge deviances from the original story line, and poor Irish/Italian accent from Carmalengo Played by Ewan Mcgregor, made for the worst book to film EVER.As a huge fan of A&D the book, i had high hopes for a more lavish, true to book detailed movie, where it would start and finish just as the book did - leaving me wanting more.All the film really did was depress me within the 1st 10 minutes.what was impressive was how the... sorry! i couldn't even finish that sentence without laughing.in short - Vittoria was the token hottie, a very second to Audrey Tatou and there were some very nice Alfa Romeos.i would recommend reading the book to understand that, if Ron Howard must insist on making ANOTHER book to film, i would be happy saving my £6.40 for a KFC zinger meal and some chicken wings - far more entertaining and deeply more satisfying!",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
On higher gear than its predecessor,"I am in love with adventures of prof. Langdon so far. Angels and Demons are bigger in sense of plot and scale - and does it quite nice.

I love the soundtracks so far and have to admit that Hans Zimmer was completely on fire writing those pieces.Cinematography is ok, nothing really breathtaking but it is sufficient to be entertained.

Great Adaptation!!!,"I saw this movie as a preview and to say the least I had a wonderful experience. although for some absurd reason the critics in London have grilled the movie but for no reason the director or the movie as a project deserves the thrashing.da vinci code was a good movie but i had my reservations against its adaptation. as far as the adaptation is concerned angels and demons was great. there are a few things that do not coincide with the book but the changes were acceptable and fully justifiable.some sequences have been shown with less depth and some deleted but it has to be kept in mind that if all these minute details were considered, this movie would have been at least 5 hours in lenght. and thats not the case with this movie rather its with any adaptation be it Charlie and the chocolate factory or the Bourne identity.tom hanks as Robert langdon does not need any description. to say the least he carried forward his spell created from da vinci code as Harvard symbologist. the role of Vittoria vetra played by ayelet zurer was carried out efficiently but Ewan McGregor as camerlengo Patrick was the surprise package. his acting was superb! Ron Howard has moved to a different level of direction. direction was nearly flawless.in the end what matters is whether the cast & crew were able to recreate the magic as the author or not. my brother who went with me to see the movie had'nt read the book but was astounded by the ""magic created"". for me its recommended to every movie lover. u wont be disappointed for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Good, entertaining thriller from Ron Howard","Angels & Demons-***-See it- Directed by: Ron Howard, Written by: David Koepp, Akiva Goldsman, Dan Brown (Novel), Starring: Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Stellan Skarsgard, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Kaas, Armin Mueller-Stahl, Rance Howard, Gino Conforti.Dan Brown's prequel to his controversial and best selling novel becomes a film as religious symboligist Robert Langdon (Hanks) rushes for the clues to solve a mystery in which a secret society known as The Illuminati has captured four cardinals, killed The Pope, and are threatening to destroy Vatican City with a special anti-matter canister.This film (like its predecessor) is in no way a form of art, nor does it bring up any new questions or thoughts, but what it does work as is pure entertainment and a guilty pleasure that has us until the end. Director Howard kicks up the pace over his slow-moving Da Vinci Code and catches us by surprise. The twists continue to reveal themselves as the story goes on and refuses to take a rest.That is part of what makes it such an thrilling experience is the pace and the twists, plus a lot of great actors such as Hanks, McGregor, Skarsgard, and Mueller Stahl thrown in for good measure. The end result is not masterful, but it sure is captivating.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Much better than The Da Vinci Code,"I saw this film last night and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised.I have both read and thoroughly enjoyed Dan Brown's novels so it was disappointing to see that Ron Howards Da Vinic Code failed to live up to the high standards set by the book. With regards to this, I expected much of the same from Angels and Demons, so it was brilliant when I came out of the cinema thinking that I had just seen a pretty good film.Yes it is pretty good. Not excellent, but pretty good. The film is much faster paced than the Da Vinci Code which I feel is one of the reasons behind why I enjoyed the film more. The actors do a great job and I particularly enjoyed Ewan Mcgregor's role in the film as the camerlengo. I also enjoyed the soundtrack.One of my main assumptions about modern entertainment, is that the book is always better then the film. Indeed, the case is no different here but the point I want to stress is that the film leaves a lot of stuff out and even alters certain events or details. However, in retrospect I can see that this suits the fast paced narrative and by no means does it spoil the film.Just like the Da Vinci Code, this film has it's critics, but I want to stress how hard it is to turn a Dan Brown novel which excels on attention to detail and problem solving within the minds of the character's heads, into a successful film.I urge people to see this film because it provides good entertainment and I left with a sense of satisfaction. I give the film 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Nice ride, good to watch, but not as good as the book","I just saw Angels and Demons from its first screening yesterday in Manila, and I must say that it's a decent rendition of the book.Basically, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is asked by the Vatican (or at least the security people handling most of the Vatican except for the Pope's protection which is care of the Swiss guard) to help understand the symbols and other forms of symbolism to help catch an erstwhile thought long-gone group called the Illuminati.The Illuminati has apparently kidnapped the 4 Preferiti, the top cardinals who are on top of the Vatican cardinals' list to succeed the recently deceased Pope. And not only are they threatening to kill them off every hour, they also stole a device with a deadly bomb-esquire effect and hid it somewhere in the Vatican.Now there's a race against time as the hours pass, and thousands of people waiting in St. Peter's Square to wait for the announcement of the new Pope.I actually found this movie lag behind Da Vinci Code in terms of twists, build up to the climax, and action, which is unlike the book in the sense that I prefer the Angels and Demons book compared to The Da Vinci Code because of its action, suspense and twists and superb plot.Whether this will make millions, the answer is clearly sure, but whether it will become a classic movie thriller/mystery, I'm not certain. At any rate, it's a good movie to watch and simply enjoy, but I don't see myself buying the DVD as soon as it comes out.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Your average thriller,"For me, this is one of the rare cases that doesn't call I-read-the-book-movie-sucks evaluation. Indeed, the screenplay cherry picks the reasonable parts of Brown's story omitting the nonsense in the book. With most action pulled by Tom Hanks, Ayelet Zurer's character seems like a filler for a female cast. To make things worse, Zurer acts more like a lab technician than a top notch physicist. The plot is simplistic and predictable. If you read Dan Brown's other books or saw Da Vinci code, it won't take you long to figure out the twists and the villain. Some nice scenes from Rome are the redeeming qualities of an otherwise average popcorn flick. This is not a thriller that will blow you away but will probably entertain you on a lazy Friday night.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Utter Crap,"This is absolutely one of the worst movies ever made. Terrible. Ridiculous plot, stupid ""twists,"" bad acting, Howard's directing is contrived and banal, with hokey dialogue.

This movie fails on every level, with the pacing kept at a manic pace so that you don't have time to think about the laughable plot. A movie should be true to the world it is in; this movie is not. Only the streets of Rome give any interest and some nice Bernini sculpture takes your eyes away from this tripe bag of garbage. What a waste of money and talent.

haven't read the book,"""Angels & Demons"" precedes ""The Da Vinci Code"" in literature, but in film it's reversed. I admit I haven't read either book, and I liked ""The Da Vinci Code"" better. It was a more fascinating premise.""Angeles & Demons"" is a magnificently produced, elaborate film starring Tom Hanks, Ewan McGregor, Ayelet Zurer, Armin Mueller-Stahl, and Stellan Skarsgård.The emphasis here is on action and a fairly fast pace, with Hanks and Zurer racing all over Vatican City while angelic music plays. The plot concerns Robert Langdom (Hanks) being summoned by Rome after the Pope's death, and as the conclave of cardinals gather to elect a new one. It appears that the Illuminati, a secret brotherhood, wronged by the church, is now seeking revenge. The group has kidnapped four cardinals, - in fact, those thought to have the best chance of becoming Pope, intending to kill one an hour. They have also stolen an antimatter bomb from a science lab. Langdon is needed to interpret some ancient symbols and find the Illumination Path. In order to get the information he needs, Langdon has to arrange everything through the carmelango, Patrick McKenna (McGregor) who acts in absence of a pope. Along the way, Langdon realizes that there is probably an inside man at the Vatican helping the Illuminati.Hanks is in the film for his name value. He's very good, but to my mind, this isn't a particularly challenging role. It needs someone authoritative and mature who comes off as intelligent. Hanks fills all of those qualifications, as would David Strathairn or any number of other actors. Ayelet Zurer doesn't have much to do as the scientist trying to recover the antimatter bomb. Both Ewan McGregor and Armin Mueller-Stahl make great impressions in their roles. It's an excellent cast all around.Though filmed only partly on location, the whole thing comes off as a magnificent travelogue, and the soundtrack is haunting and beautiful.Definitely worth seeing though not nearly as provocative as ""The Da Vinci Code,"" and if you can see it on a big flat TV screen, you'll like it even more. Today, we're used to seeing smaller, independent films, or films with big special effects. This movie has special effects, all right, but the huge budget also allows for the top drawer all the way, including gorgeous locations, an enormous cast, beautiful color, a top director, exotic lighting, stunning photography, and great music. The opportunities of seeing all of that in one film are becoming rarer and rarer.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
It Will Make You Want To Read More About It,"""Angels and Demons"" is actually my favorite Dan Brown book, more than the more popular ""The Da Vinci Code."" Even when I was just reading A&D, you already get a sense of how cinematic the entire story was. Apart from the obvious travelogue interest in the Rome and Vatican locales where the action takes place, we also get a closer look into the inner workings of the Vatican and the fabled history of the Illuminati.""Angels and Demons"" the movie stayed quite loyal to the main storyline of the book. The Pope just died and the Cardinals are in conclave to elect a new Pope. Before that could happen however, a terrorist kidnapped four favored Cardinals and starts to kill them ceremonially in various locations, invoking the Church's historical dispute with the Illuminati. This terrorist does all this while holding the entire Vatican City under threat of annihilation with a powerful anti-matter explosive. The plot, especially the ending, is admittedly very unlikely and highly over-the-top but it makes for a perfect summer blockbuster.For me, the most interesting character in A&D is the enigmatic Camerlengo. He is the priest who is the dead Pope's closest aide and confidante, and who temporarily holds the Papal powers while the new Pope has yet to be elected. I remember I was very fascinated with this character because I have never heard of such a position in the Vatican, even after years of Catholic education. I learned afterward that Dan Brown fictionalized this part as a real Camerlengo should be a Cardinal, an elector and possible candidate for Pope, unlike what was written in the book. The movie makes major changes in the character of this Camerlengo. In the book, his name is Carlo Ventresca, a young Italian priest. In the movie, he becomes Patrick McKenna, a young Irish priest who used to fly military missions against the IRA. I do not know if these modifications were made to fit the actor who played him, Ewan McGregor, or vice versa.Unfortunately, the main debit of the movie for me is still the actor playing the main character, Robert Langdon. Tom Hanks is completely wrong as Robert Langdon. It did not work in DVC, nor did it work here in A&D. The other members of the cast did very well in their roles. Israeli stunner Ayelet Zurer made a very good Vittoria Vetra. She is much better than Audrey Tatou was in DVC. Stellan Skargaard and Armin Muller Stahl were solid and imposing as Commander Richter and Cardinal Strauss respectively. It was a bit of a stretch to imagine Ewan MacGregor as a priest, much less the Camerlengo, but he was not bad at all.So overall, this is a very good and exciting summer movie. Ron Howard did much better in this one than DVC. As before, do not take everything seriously as this is fiction. For those who have not read the book, read it! And later, you will be enticed to research more about Vatican lore, the Papacy, and the Illuminati, as I was, to distinguish what is fact from the fiction.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Not great, but at least it's better than ""The Da Vinci Code"".","Historically, the Illuminati were a secret society which existed in Bavaria during the 1770s and 1780s; their rationalistic critique of religion won them the enmity of the Catholic Church and they were suppressed by the authorities. They have, however, flourished more in the pages of fiction and of conspiracy theories than they ever did in the pages of history; they are frequently depicted as a sinister, secretive organisation pulling the strings of power in the modern world, even though there is no evidence that they actually still exist.Dan Brown's novel ""Angels & Demons"", on which this film is based, is an example. In Brown's conception, the Illuminati were founded in 17th century Italy rather than 18th century Germany, included many scientists among their ranks, survived an attempt (""La Purga"") to wipe them out in 1668 and still exist today. They are strongly opposed to Christianity, especially Catholicism, which they regard as the enemy of science and reason.The film opens soon after the death of the reigning Pope, Pius XVI, and the action plays out against the backdrop of the conclave called to elect his successor. Four of the ""preferiti""- the Cardinals considered most likely to be elected Pope- are kidnapped by a terrorist group claiming to be the Illuminati. They threaten that the four will be murdered in revenge for ""la purga"" and for the Church's role in persecuting scientists and freethinkers over the centuries. They also claim to have stolen a vial of antimatter from the CERN research facility in Switzerland and that this will be used to destroy the Vatican (and with it a large part of the city of Rome). The Church enlist the services of the famous symbologist Professor Robert Langdon, hoping that he will be able to decipher a trail of clues and signs leading to the Illuminati. Assisting Langdon in his quest is Dr. Vittoria Vetra, a CERN scientist. (Her name was possibly borrowed from the 1960s American actress and glamour model Victoria Vetri). The story becomes very complicated, so I won't set it out any further, although I will say that there is a twist near the end which significantly changes the direction in which the plot is travelling. The threat to the kidnapped Cardinals and to the city remains real, but it may not come from the source which Langdon, and the audience, have been led to expect.The film is a sequel to ""The Da Vinci Code"", also based upon a novel by Brown, and also featuring the character of Langdon. I didn't really like ""The Da Vinci Code"", largely because of the extraordinary number of errors of fact it contained. These errors were not just minor goofs; many of them were central to the story, and it is difficult to take a thriller seriously when just above every twist and turn in the plot revolves around an obvious historical, geographical or theological absurdity. ""Angels & Demons"" was rather better in this respect. It does have its fair share of goofs, but they are less fundamental to the story, and if you can accept Brown's alternate history of the Illuminati everything else seems to flow naturally from it, although I did find the final twist difficult to swallow.The film is visually attractive, but being set in a city as beautiful as Rome it could hardly be anything else. Good use is made of real-life locations; I was reminded of my own visit to the city with my wife several years ago when we visited most of the old churches and other locations featured here. Tom Hanks is not really at his best here, but then action thrillers are not really his forte. (He is better in dramas with a greater human interest, such as ""Forrest Gump"", ""Catch Me If You Can"" or ""Road to Perdition""). Ayelet Zurer as Vittoria does not make much impression, but at least she is better than Audrey Tautou, the female lead in ""The Da Vinci Code"", who, like a number of her compatriots from Brigitte Bardot onwards, always sounds more convincing when acting in her own language than in English. Overall, if you can take it seriously, which is not always easy, ""Angels and Demons"" is a relatively enjoyable thriller. 6/10Some goofs. There is no such academic discipline as ""symbology"". The academic study of signs and symbols is actually called ""semiotics"". If one wanted to combine the Greek word ""symbolon"" (symbol) with the ""-ology"" ending, the correct form would be ""symbolology"". There have only been twelve Popes called Pius, so the regnal number Pius XVI seems strangely high for a film set in the present, not at some future date. The Latin and Italian we hear in the film is not always correct. I will not set out all the examples I noticed, but the Italian word ""purga"" does not rhyme with the English ""burger"". There is no such phrase in Latin as ""tempe sede vacante"". The correct usage would be ""tempus sede vacante"" or ""in tempore sede vacante"".",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Doesn't have a prayer,"Every time a new pope is selected the Vatican blows smoke in the air and it seems as though every time Dan Brown is ready to make another couple million, he blows smoke up an audience's ass. ""Angels and Demons"", sequel to the equally controversial ""The Davinci Code"", will no doubt come under fire from Catholics and movie fans alike, yet still be a license to print money somehow. It's tedious, one-dimensional, bland, and the action (if you even want to call it that) is not only boring but it's also ugly. And as for Tom Hanks and director Ron Howard, well, you don't hear much about either one slumming for a paycheck but it looks as though ""Davinci"" has started a trend.Hanks reprises his role as symbologist Robert Langdon, this time called to Rome by the Vatican to investigate the re-appearance of the secret scientific sect called the Illuminati. They have captured 4 Cardinals and are threatening to blow up the Vatican with anti-matter (basically much more lethal bomb). It turns into a race-against-time scenario when Langdon and physicist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) find out that the Illuminati appear to be killing the cardinals at the four alters of science. But are the Illuminati really behind this? They are aided by the Swiss Guard (led by Stellan Skarsgard). While this is all going on, the pope has recently died and the other Cardinals have been sequestered to pick a new one. Overseeing it all is Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor).Think ""Davinci Code"" without the big reveal in the middle. The screenplay, written by Akiva Goldsman and David Koepp, is just a lot of running around. Langdon uses his theological knowledge to ridiculously make everything his compass. A pointing statue means go that way. A dot on a map here makes a cross so that must be the next place they have to go. C'moooooon! As they race from point A to B, director Ron Howard's rapid camera and Hans Zimmer's pounding musical score are poor substitutes for the plot's lack of thrills. There isn't much action. A one-sided shoot-out where an assassin basically just picks people off, some gruesome deaths (including two where characters are burned alive), none of it entertaining. Howard does a nice job of panning the camera along the various monuments and architecture of Rome but he can't save this tedious plot that completely jumps the shark in the third act with an obvious and hooey-filled conclusion.Hanks is a pro at comedy and drama but he gets next to none of those things here. Instead he's a stuffed-suit without the slightest hint of personality, spewing out knowledge but never anything worth caring about. McGregor gets a nice speech about the religion vs. science debate, which he knocks out of the park, and Stellan Skarsgard and Armin Mueller Mueller Stahl both offer some menacing intrigue but these characters suffer from a script that relies heavily on contrived plot conventions over interesting characters.The movie deserves some defense from the Catholics. Leave it alone. It's garbage. People know it's garbage before they even enter the theater. In fact, why even go to the theater? These stories may offer some guilty pleasures about Church secrets and conspiracies but in all honesty you can barely even call them stories. ""Angels and Demons"" is the last in the Robert Langdon series that I know of, and with any luck, it will stay that way.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"An Improvement, But Not By Much","Preferable to its predecessor, The Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons continues down the ancient Catholic rhetoric, without going down so many tangents the ultimate arc is unrecognisable. However, this does not mean that is any less ridiculous at times, and does make it predictable a lot more frequently.The storyline is more than clear, displaying the rivalry with the Illuminati, and Hanks as the lead explains everything as they sprint around so that the audience can keep up with proceedings. The rest of the cast do their jobs well to create the story, but at no point does it particularly get gripping. It is an intelligent story, obviously following the Dan Brown novel, but daft parts are accentuated by the addition of big cinematic moments.If you enjoyed the first then absolutely watch this (although seeing the first is not necessary to understand the second), if it wasn't for you, this won't be either.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

More thrills than theology same plot different locale,Its more of the same and I am bored with it. Hitchcock for 2009. An innocent by stander thrown in the middle of large scale political intrigue with the help of an unsuspecting and thoroughly supportive by stander. Yet this film is even more problematic in that so many of the nemesis' inherent contradictions defy what is plausible. Still its a spectacle and Howard cannot be criticized for his craftsmanship but at this point there is nothing new there. Its all formula.Which brings us to the question when does Howard get tired of seeing and making the same old film over and over again? When does he break the rules and defy his own convention?

The acting, though not Oscar-worthy, is anything you might expect for a summer movie. The editing is done very well. And the special effect is marvelous.

Where did it all go right?,"OK, so having read the reviews excoriating this movie I allowed myself to be dragged along to to see it with low expectations. I have now realised that Irish Times journalist Donald Clark is in fact a reverse barometer. He gave it 1 star out of 5. OK so it is not 5/5 but it is a respectable 3/5 and an amusing way to spend a couple of hours, even exciting. It is in fact much better than the Da Vinci Code mainly because it has better pacing, some genuinely exciting scenes and it is better visually.It is a chase movie and like the airport book it was inspired from, it is pretty vacuous abusing the disciplines of history, physics and logic in equal measure. But it's fun. You don't go to a movie like this expecting a watertight plot or expecting a message to humanity. You go because you want a bit of entertainment and popcorn. You don't expect the hero to die, you know he will save the day in the end. But so what? When you go on a fairground ride you know how it will end, but you expect thrills none the less.And if you are a physicist who is offended by scientific impossibilities, then you are in the same class as the religious types offended by the Da Vinci Code, unable to suspend disbelief.Does what it says on the tin.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery

By streamlining the novel's narrative, the film loses much (but not all) of the science vs. faith dichotomy that gave the book its weight. As it is, the film version ofAngels and Demons makes for a very entertaining thriller.Some of the dialogue is poor, you have to suspend disbelief the way you would for a James Bond or Indiana Jones movie, and keep in mind that this is historical fiction (emphasis on fiction). If you can do that, this is a blast. Ewan McGregor rocks. Be warned, it is violent and intense, and pushes that PG-13 boundary. My grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better adaptation than The Da Vinci Code...,"After watching the trailers and hearing good things from the movie, i decided to go watch it. For those who have read the novel, may find that there are a few differences in a couple scenes. The setting of the film was in Vatican City, Rome, Italy. As much as they weren't allowed to film inside the Vatican, they did a fairly good job at simulating the setting with the computers etc. What I would recommend to those who are planning to watch the film, and have not read the novel beforehand, I would suggest that you pay close attention to what they are saying. There are some information which the book talks about which are not mentioned in the film, hence some viewers may be a bit confused. In the film, the style and speed of which the characters solve riddles/mysteries is a bit too fast and not detailed enough. However, the film still stretched to 2hr and 20mins!All-in-all it is a big improvement from The Da Vinci Code!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Preposterous Indiana Jones lite.,"I am agnostic, but an apathetic agnostic.I don't believe in a spiritual or celestial being of any kind, nor do I think that there is a big party in the sky after death, but I don't care if others do.Nor do I spend much time musing their decisions or mine, I just go on with my life without giving the whole matter much thought.So when alleged ""controversy"" erupts whenever any film concerning religion or even religious elements or parables I am more bemused than anything that people would give it the time of day.Angels and Demons basically follows the increasingly unbelievable adventures of Robert Langdon, an expert on religious symbolism and it appears almost everything else, as he tries to stop the execution of 4 guys in lone for the Pope's throne.We met Langdon in The Da Vince code, a film so long and boring that when the DVD I rented shut down with about 5 minutes of the film to go, I didn't bother asking for a refund or a replacement to finish it. (I only rented this one as my wife wanted to watch it.)The Pope is dead, meaning the election of a new Pope must immediately take place. However the 4 most likely ""Popes in waiting"" have been taken from Vatican City, supposedly by the Illuminati, (which will be familiar to fans of Tupac). The Illuminati have said that the four cardinals will all be killed and that Vatican City will be destroyed by a huge explosion which was conveniently lying around and stolen earlier in the film.(Best way to explain the difference between the Illuminati and the Church? Illuminati: Pro science and logic, apparently banished a great many years ago and said to include many illustrious names from the art world. The Church: Pro religion (duh), and anti anyone that tries to defy their teachings.)So the Church calls in Langdon to attempt to solve the case before the Illuminati kill the four cardinals, and the scientist Dr Victoria who developed the boom-boom that was stolen in the first place somehow is able to tag along.Now Bob, being a symbologist and dealing more with facts is not of good terms with the Church, who have previously given him the cold shoulder when he requested permission to look into their archives for his research, but given the gravity of the situation the late Pope's right hand man, played by Ewan McGregor grants access to Bob and for some reason Victoria.Now Bob is obviously a genius and in the span of two minutes reads something into every second line of the sacred documents, including things never previously discovered for centuries that lead him directly to the trail of the killer(s).For the rest of the movie the chase is on, Bob and Vicky must prevent any further killing and therefore save the face and credibility of the Church, as apparently even though the church has massive funds and manpower at their disposal they never seem to uncover anything. In fact whenever Langdon does correctly interpret the latest clue or symbol and relays this info to the Church he is treated with contempt, despite being right or very nearly right every other time in the film.The dialogue is overblown and preposterous, filled with a massive amount of information and detail that Bob picks off the top of his head and manages to utilize immediately to stay on the trail.Victoria is simply there to lag after Bob and to receive his wordy explanations, and to shout ""Over here"" at various times, and several other recognizable faces are there as either red herrings or to cause conflict between the parties so that the audience doesn't realize that what they are watching is largely mumbo-jumbo fanciful drivel, albeit entertaining Hollywood drivel.The final third is laughable to anyone who actually thinks about it realistically, but as said above all in all the film sizzles along at breakneck speed, and like most films if you are willing to ignore logic there are some good moments to be had. I just wish that the subject matter wasn't held as something sooooo important and potentially globally calamitous, as this is basically Indiana Jones lite.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Preposterous and enjoyable in equal measure. Take off your logic cap even moreso than usual with this one and you'll emerge unscathed.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pretty good. At least not a snoozefest.,"I thought this movie was pretty good. I never read the book and never will. Its kind of predictable but way way better than the davinci code. The best word to describe this movie is Grand. Its very visionary and no doubt controversial, especially among catholics, but entertaining nonetheless. The opening was very very good and the movie had me riveted in my seat the whole time. The long boring conversations of the first are now replaced by tension and ticking doomsday clock. The race is on to uncover the truth and expose the secret behind the illuminatti. Tom Hanks offered a decent performance but i think Ewan McGregor was excellent as the carmelango. The girl was pretty much just there to throw another girl into the mix as she really ends up having no purpose whatsoever. So definitely go check this movie out.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Surprisingly Fun but not what i expected,"I went to see this movie without any high expectations(since The DaVinci code did not impress me that much). I haven't read the book so my comments are strictly about the movie and it's script. To be frank i love the subject matter and all kinds of conspiracy theories related to the Church, the Vatican,secret societies etc. Well, the movie did not amaze me in this aspect, since it was more of a fast-paced action-thriller then a real conspiracy movie. If you expected a rich storyline which would interweave facts and fiction about the Illuminati, their secret acts and their hundreds years old struggle with the Vatican you might be disappointed. However, if you can enjoy a quick-paced thriller which is not trying to be the smartest movie you've seen and you can enjoy a movie that would require some suspension of disbelief for the sake of entertainment you might find that this is an above-average movie. All in all that was not what i expected but it was a fun ride - better then the most movies of it's kind that Hollywood keeps pumping out every year. I would rate it somewhere between 6 and 7 for the entertainment value.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Awful,"Terrible film. And i usually never say anything bad about film's. I watched this minutes after finishing the book and i feel sorry for Dan because of this rubbish Ron has made.SOO much is missed out of the film that added the adventure. Even continuities were all wrong. They had the probably people playing certain characters which left gaps in the plot.I see the morale behind the book as giving people faith in both science and religion, and one is not the same without the other. The message given with this film is that the anti-matter is bad and they must get rid of it. Awful.Ewan Mcgregor is one of my favourite actors and it is a shame to see the director didn't work with his emotions more in this. Many of the actors actually unperformed which is a shame.The only decent part i thought was at the end. But even that was all wrong! I won't give any spoilers.The mystery and adventure has been removed from this film, and so i shall only rate is 3.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Lighting up the Ridiculous,"Before we start this action packed, edge of your seat review of Angels and Demons I am going to take a little time out to explain to you what a film review is, the origins of film criticism and why knowing this will help you understand the subsequent paragraphs. Now you might be thinking, this is a little long winded I want to get to the action, I can pick up on the theory as I go along Well if you are thinking this, and I wouldn't blame you, I wouldn't recommend you see Angels and Demons!Let me attempt a brief overview of where we are before we hit the main review (Ron Howard, David Koepp take note). Following on from the critically panned but box office success of The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown's novel Angels and Demons reunites Ron Howard and Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon in another religion come politics come art history romp against time. There done! Having read both Dan Brown novels, Angels and Demons is by far the more entertaining book and should on all counts be a better film, which to be fair it is However this is like saying being crucified upright is better than being crucified upside down – there really isn't much in it and either way it is going to be pretty miserable.One of the many criticisms thrown at The Da Vinci Code was the film's inability to balance the historical storytelling with the modern day action, which in the end slowed the narrative to a plodding lethargic bus ride of a movie. Ron Howard has obviously listened to his critics; by stripping a lot of unnecessary narrative from the book the overall film seems much lighter on its feet, which in general is a good thing. Langdon jumps in cars and runs around Rome with a map in this one! However and here is my big concern the dialogue is appalling. We still have the tour book commentary from the know-it-all Langdon, who doesn't talk to people he lectures them. The plot twists are inevitable and completely ludicrous and don't even get me started on Ewan McGregor's accent or ability to fly helicopters. If you thought Sean Connery's Irish accent was bad in The Untouchables MY GOD! The joy of discovery is totally lost in this film with over explanation after over explanation completely bombing any finer detail out what could have been a decent if not particularly clever plot.Condescending, unsophisticated and ultimately ridiculous The Vatican must be wondering what it was so worried about. This film isn't anti-Catholic it is anti-intelligent.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Don't believe the bad reviews!,"I would definitely recommend this movie - don't listen to the bad reviews in all of the newspapers: these are the same people that hate Dan Brown's books so why should they like any movie based off them?Angels & Demons was an overall good movie. Here's the rundown:1. Captures the excitement of the book with great actions scenes and tense chases2. Fantastic cinematography - many beautiful and awe-inspiring shots that are exciting and satisfying3. Solid acting - nothing special, but certainly not distracting4. Leaves the philosophical mumbo-jumbo to the book - sure, the movie adds in its little tidbits of religion vs. science but it doesn't try to make a big deal out of it5. Good music - typical Zimmer stuff but very well placed in terms of scenes6. Yes! moments - Howard definitely delivers the most intense/exciting scenes from the book with a satisfyingly similar atmosphere to the book; some things were obviously left out but it all seemed to work out because the movie felt like it was a good length.So overall, it was an enjoyable, exciting, satisfying movie to watch. I highly recommend it!N.B. Reading the book beforehand added to the effect of the movie instead of detracting from it.Rating: 7.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Intriguing and mysterious thriller that takes too long,This thriller didn't exceed my expectations and it was definitely too long. The story itself was intriguing and mysterious but all seen in other movies before. Therefore I have to admit that I liked a lot the scenery in Rome and as an Italian I didn't know that the Roman church Panteone is the oldest one built in this eternal city at 27 before Christ's birth year. Even the secret passages in the Vatican area were interesting to see. I don't know if all the turning places were original. The music composed by Hans Zimmer was very authentic and wonderful as in The Gladiator. I found very curious hearing some sentences spoken by the Swiss Guard in their Swiss dialect in a Hollywood film because I am living in this little country Switzerland. Be prepared on a very unexpected end. I hope that there will be another sequel but with a shorter running time. Final vote: 6/10.,6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Growling Constipation,"I think after the first one, this is just disappointing. The Da Vinci Code introduced the Chevaliers de Sangreal, the premise of clues hidden within the church, and an Christian-like alternative to National Treasure. Albeit controversial, still interesting. The second one doesn't incite any emotional bearing whatsoever. Any good action film like James Bond or National Treasure, in movieland -you gotta change paces and move from town to town -globe trotter! This premise is set within the Vatican, which I find boring. I half expected Anne Hathaway's boyfriend to appear.Furthermore, Tom Hanks' acting is less than superior. His voice is low, rich in a bad way -like very sticky molasses that's trailing mud. His eyebrows furrowed at everything. The writing was just awful. Everyone knows movies are usually scripted, but you don't notice it when you're watching it. But this one -as the lines are delivered -it's so blatant that those lines are written.The twist at the end wasn't very good, as it wasn't dramatic or revealed in an OMG-way.Cinematography -too much looking at them run, or looking at where they're running. Overview shots of city scenery was good though.The only thing I enjoyed was that they included the concept of the Illuminati, which wasn't developed 'cuz you'll realize it's all bogus anyway. I loved the particle accelerator creating antimatter since they've been trying to do that for years, and if it was reality -may i say HOLY S***.PS -Peeved that Langdon just HAD to be stationed at the cliché Harvard University.All in all, nothing overly enjoyable, since you pretty much know what's going to happen. The story isn't developed well, nor do the actors make it interesting. I expect better from Tom Hanks and Ron Howard.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Faithful and unremarkable.,"I remember reading the Dan Brown book about four years ago now, and here I am watching the movie. First things first, let me just say what a remarkable job the director and writer did keeping everything true to the original novel, with only a few things that I can remember not being here - quite a remarkable feat, and between this and Watchmen, 2009 is truly a year for great book-to-movie adaptations.However, really this is just a standard action movie otherwise, as it isn't really pulled off with enough gusto to really remain captivating. The acting is passable, the directing is passable...everything is just rather adequate. It is a lot of fun at times, but it's also a bit boring at times - possibly reflecting here on Dan Brown instead of the screenwriters? Whatever the cause, this movie is a bit of a mixed bag between good stuff and stuff that will make you want to fast forward a bit. Angels and Demons may not be a genre transcending movie but it is a lot of fun, and if you're looking for a summer blockbuster...well, really, I guess you could do a lot worse than this.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Nothing special,"First of all, I didn't read the books and didn't see the first movie so I'm not able to compare this movie with those. I just rate it as a movie.I'm very disappointed on the way this movie turned out. The flow of the action is very stop-and-go and the dialog is often very strange. A lot of the time you see two characters in a scene explaining their actions or their thoughts to each other. It doesn't feel natural at all, the characters are explaining their steps out loud as they go. It feels like they are not talking to each other but to the viewer to be sure he/she can follow the twists and turns of the movie.As a result the acting feels forced. The action scenes are done well.Overall this is still a book and not a movie. It could have been a good movie if they had confidence in the audience and didn't explain everything out loud.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Professor Langdon Saves The Vatican From Itself,"As one who appreciates the use of irony, I have to admit that it was the use of irony that really made this movie work for me. Where the original story in the series - ""The Da Vinci Code"" (which I thought it was taken far too seriously by too many of my fellow Christians) - came across as more of a deliberate attempt to call religion itself and especially the Catholic Church into question, this takes a much broader approach to the question of religion. It makes sure that some of the evils of religion are portrayed, but at the same time it's made clear that these are the evils of men rather than evils by which to judge either God or faith.The basis of the story is the so-called ""God particle,"" and deals with the attempts of scientists to recreate the moment of creation. Having succeeded in that, what results is a particle of immense destructive power which is somehow seized by the ""Illuminati"" - a somewhat shady historical society which in this movie is portrayed as a quasi-terrorist organization acting against the Roman Catholic Church - and is used as a threat to blow up the Vatican during a conclave to select a new pope. This becomes a sort of Vatican cloak and dagger movie. Four cardinals are kidnapped by this group, who leave clues as to what will happen, and we discover early on that there's a limited amount of time before the bomb blows up, so in some ways this becomes a stereotypical (but well done) countdown movie, where you're pretty sure everything will work out in the end, but you're not sure how you'll get there. To unravel the puzzle, the Vatican (somewhat unconvincingly, given his history) calls upon the ""religious symbologist"" Robert Langdon (again played by Tom Hanks.) You can't really be sure who's on what side until the very end of the movie, and some of the twists that take place as the movie nears its end took me completely by surprise. I thought I had the whole thing figured out with an hour to go, but I didn't, so that was quite effective.Things perhaps got a wee bit silly from the point of the parachuting priest onward, but it was decent fun, and I did appreciate the irony of Langdon becoming the one whom Cardinal Strauss concedes (over Langdon's objections) was called by God to save the church essentially from itself. I also liked Strauss's line ""religion is flawed because man is flawed,"" which seems to sum things up quite nicely. Overall, I liked this more than ""The Da Vinci Code,"" perhaps because, minus the controversy of the earlier novel/movie, I could appreciate this more on its own merits.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Angelic Possession - Ron Howard and co attempt to atone for ""The Da Vinci Code"", and mostly succeed","Harvard professor and symbology super-sleuth Robert Langdon is back in this second adaptation of a Dan Brown novel. Besides the main character (played again by the inimitable Tom Hanks), the Oscar-winning team of director Ron Howard and producer Brian Grazer have returned for the sequel. In the wake of 2006's critically-derided The Da Vinci Code, how does its screen sequel fare?There's a terrorist threat to the Papal Conclave in the Vatican, and the clues seem to suggest an ancient evil is rearing his head, so the Vatican turn to Dr Robert Langdon. He is roped in by Inspector Ernesto Olivetti (Pierfrancesco Favino) of the Gendarme Corps of Vatican City State (otherwise known as the Vatican Police) and decipher cryptic symbols left as clues by the Illuminati and assist the Swiss Guard and the afore-mentioned Vatican Police in rescuing the four cardinals and finding the antimatter before it consumes the Vatican. The beautiful CERN physicist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer) is also drawn into the fray, but even the combined expertise of both academics seems almost powerless to stop the looming Illuminati threat.Now, if the above synopsis sounds far-fetched, be warned that it is just the tip of this cinematic iceberg. Author Dan Brown is known for meddling fact and fiction and even passing off the former as the latter, achieving at-times laughable results. Plenty of plot points are downright ludicrous and there are enough contrivances to fill St Peter's Square. The key prefix in this film is ""pseudo"" – the film is built on pseudo-science, pseudo-history, pretty much pseudo-everything. Stock characters and a fish market of red herrings also populate the picture. Therefore, suspension of disbelief is key. Thankfully though, the movie is paced well-enough, so much so that one eventually buys into the hodgepodge and goes along for the ride.We are treated to a wonderful tour of The Vatican City that is part The Amazing Race (but with dead bodies and shootouts instead of roadblocks and detours), part dramatic angel's-eye-views of the world's smallest country. The fortress-church Castel Sant' Angelo, the famous Sistine Chapel, Santa Maria Del Popolo with its imposing obelisk and the former Roman temple of ""all gods"" the Pantheon all figure in this whirlwind romp. While some of Angels & Demons was shot on location, the filmmakers were not granted access to several sites within the Vatican Walls, as such set reconstructions and some digital magic was employed. The results are actually fairly impressive, one might even be fooled into thinking the computer-generated replicas are the real thing.Ron Howard and company are eminent forces in Hollywood today and exert that power by casting relatively big names. While this film boasts slightly less star power than its predecessor (The Da Vinci Code had actors such as Jean Reno and Ian McKellen among its cast), everyone puts in fairly credible performances here. Tom Hanks lends much credibility to the Langdon role, and gets plenty more to do in this than in the last film, from dodging bullets to saving a drowning man and from taking a dip in speedos to feverishly thumbing through ancient documents. Some of the time though, Hanks clearly has his tongue in his cheek, and especially excels in the rare humorous moments that do ease the cinematic tension. As the female lead, Israeli actress Zurer does barely as good a job as Hanks, relegated to tagging along in the mad dashes from church to church. However, she isn't a bad actress per se and I look forward to seeing her in more Hollywood projects.As for the supporting cast, it is good to see Ewan ""Obi-Wan"" McGregor turning in his Jedi robes from the Star Wars prequel trilogy for the Camerlengo's cossack and back in a blockbuster, and truth be told he does a mighty fine job. The incredible Stellan Skarsgard (whom we've seen in such films as Good Will Hunting, The Hunt For the Red October and the Pirates of the Caribbean films), though seems under-utilized as the prickly Commandante; despite this the actor still fleshes out the slight bitterness his character bears towards Langdon with much relish.The film's small departures from the book seem to be a two-edged sword; on one hand the story has been streamlined and does work better for the screen, but on the other, interesting characters and other elements seem to have been sacrificed. Also, the book came before The Da Vinci Code, but the time-line has been altered such that this functions as a sequel, and the romantic subplot has been jettisoned in favour of a strictly professional relationship between Langdon and Vetra. It seems they learned their lesson from being too slavishly faithful to the book of ""The Da Vinci Code"".The movie is enjoyable in spite of (or perhaps because of) its sheer absurdity, offering up legitimate thrills and even a couple of outstanding action sequences. Far from being offensive or overly-controversial, Angels & Demons ends up being more cotton candy fluff than a ""lofty quest"". But have angels guided Howard and Co. in their mission nonetheless? Perhaps, though this film does have its fair share of demons to contend with as well.RATING: 3.5/5 STARS Jedd Jong",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Below expectations,"Angels & Demons is by far the best book by Dan Brown. It has a plot and pace. I'm afraid i can't say the same about the film. The film is shot in beautiful style capturing all of the Vatican & Rome. And Tom Hanks & Ewan McGregor do justice to their characters. But thats about it. the film opens well and builds up really good till it becomes a little predictable. Other characters like Ms Vetra are unconvincing to say the least. The movie lacks the pace of the book and falls apart in places. When you see Ron Howard making films like Frost/Nixon, you go with certain expectations for a film like this. It doesn't do justice to the director or the book. But a decent watch, nothing to carry home though.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A die hard fan is please and here's why,"This movie is not like the book, and it doesn't pretend to be. No this film is meant to give you a whole new adventure and perspective of Langdon's first adventure. Angels & Demons was an awesome book it was earth shattering in the way it told Langdon's powerful rise from a world renowned symbologist to literary hero.The source material for this film is not as popular as the one for the DaVinci Code, and that's is the main reason this film wasn't as well received by fans as the first, but this adventure is all the more better and has much of the things that the first film had to leave out as to tell the story. Like twice the suspense, twice the action and twice the fun. All In Angles & Demons delivers what the should have, a fun and action packed adventure.Tom Hanks gives another amazing performance as the hard working and extremely intelligent symbologist that never seems to get a real day off, this film shows us an older and more reverent Robert Langdon, it shows us that Langdon has gone trough much change since his first adventure in Paris and London. We get to see Langdon become a full fledged hero instead of just some teacher trying to clear his name of murder. Now we have Langdon do what he does best, solving a 500 year old riddle and stopping an ancient secret society from destroying the Vatican.This film is not fast paced as the trailer makes it to appear, it's a very mild paced film with some very fast and sweeping moments that you have to come back a second time just to see those parts again. But if you give this film a chance I know it will please you, I know there's no changing the minds some of the die hard fans but for those that have read the novel and are willing to give the film adaption a shot I can promise you, form being a fan of the novel myself that this film will not disappoint, it'll give you what you came for and a little more.Angels & Demons is near- perfect and will have to go down as one of the best films of 2009 and is perfect summer entrainment for all people. And it delivers.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Who owns the moment of creation?,"Plot Based on the best selling novel by author Dan Brown, Angels & Demons is a popcorn thriller about a symbologist professor named Robert Langdon, played by Tom Hanks, being summoned to the Vatican to assist in foiling a diabolical plot against the church and its cardinals. The pope has died and 4 cardinals are kidnapped before the start of the ceremony to elect a new pope. A cryptic note is sent to the Vatican police that details the intentions of the Illuminati to kill the 4 cardinals and blow up Vatican City. Robert Langdon must decipher the clues and, in a sense, save the church. Along for the ride this time is beautiful and mysterious scientist Dr. Vittoria Vetra played by Ayelet Zurer. Together the two set out on a frantic hunt to find the Path to Illumination. The story is full of church intrigue, power struggles, and violence from within and without the Vatican.Central Conflict One of the themes at the center of this movie is science versus religion. More specifically who owns the moment of creation? CERN, the European Center for Nuclear Research, is on the eve of proving the God Particle exists that created life in the universe from the collision of matter and anti-matter. The Illuminati choose this as the time to strike back at the Catholic church in an act of vengeance for a previous incident against the Illuminati referred to as La Purga where 4 members of the Illuminati were branded in the chest with crosses and burned at the stake.""Are you not Entertained?"" The verdict is Guilty. I was entertained. In a recent Colbert Report interview Ron Howard stated ""The thing that Dan Brown does so well in his novels is he collects all these fringe theories and conspiracy theories, old and new, and combines them in these works of fiction and yet he puts enough verifiable history in there so that it stimulates your imagination and your curiosity while it entertains you."" Ron Howard so succinctly encapsulates why this movie and others like it such as the National Treasure are so successful.Does this movie solve the issue between religion and science? No, but I think it sheds enough light on the subject to spark some interesting conversations that just might make people finally realize that religion and science are not inherently at odds with each other.If you're interested in this movie, you should also check out ...National Treasure National Treasure: Book of Secrets The Third Miracle Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed and of course ...

"Same grade as ""DaVinci Code,"" but different strengths and weaknesses","It has long been known that the prequel to the literary sensation ""The DaVinci Code"" would be rewritten as a sequel to the 2006 film. Other than a few token lines of dialogue referencing the first film, it really doesn't matter (not that there are many people who haven't read the book OR seen the movie). While the two films are very similar in style and plot, the films have different strengths and weaknesses.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is the renowned Harvard symbologist who prevented the destruction of the Holy Grail in the previous film. After the previous events, Langdon is obviously not high on the Vatican's list of well-liked individuals. Nevertheless, he's the only one who can help them when four cardinals who are favored for the papacy have been kidnapped, and a bomb is hidden somewhere in Vatican city that could completely destroy the city. Making matters even more desperate is the fact that because the Vatican is nominating a new pope, all the cardinals are there.This is not an actor's movie. The film moves too fast for anyone to really ""act."" Still, none of the actor's blow it. Tom Hanks essays the same character that he did in the first film, and the other major players, Ewan McGregor, Stellan Skarsgard, and Armin Mueller-Stahl do what is required of them. The newcomers, Ayelet Zurer, Thure Lindhart, Pierfrancesco Favino, Nikolaj Lie Klass, and David Pasquesi do the same. No one here is going to be up for any awards, but that's not the point. This is all story and nothing else.Ron Howard must be a director that reads reviews of his movies. Unlike ""The DaVinci Code,"" which, upon first viewing, failed to generate the momentum that the novel had, ""Angels and Demons"" does something that the first film didn't: generate legitimate tension. That's not saying that ""The DaVinci Code"" film was boring, it's just that this one contains moments of actual suspense (even if you have read the novel beforehand, like me).That is actually part of the problem. The film moves so fast, it's hard to generate any feeling for the characters, and Robert Langdon isn't really the one who's in any danger (well, sort of. Up until the end, the film concentrates on solving the most immediate of crises on the way to the big one).""Angels and Demons"" is also plagued by some technical problems. The lighting in the film is terrible. It's so dark that we can't appreciate all the majesty of the inside of the churches. Is there no legitimate light in all of Vatican City, or does everyone there just like to do everything in the dark? I don't think it's the latter. On second thought, why don't we just say that the film's cinematography as a whole is terrible, because when indoors, the camera does not make use of the large space. And even though the art is a huge part of the film, we never really get a good look at the artwork.I'm at a loss to explain why the critical reception of the film was so vicious. It's by no means perfect, but ""bad"" is certainly not a word I'd use to describe Ron Howard's new film. Even ""mediocre"" is too cruel. Do I recommend it? Sure, but the film moves so fast that I'd suggest reading the book first.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Science vs Religion,"Maybe the science is too young to understand religion but I myself as man who believe in science and my mind would accept only the facts based on experience. as Professor Robert Langdon said "" My mind tells me I will never understand God & my heart tells me I'm not meant to.""",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
it's not something to get excited about either way,"Angels and Demons follows on the heels of The Da Vinci Code as being what that movie was: something to not really be too excited about either way. In this case the MacGuffin leading the characters on their silly adventure (and yes, make no mistake, this is silliness disguised as pompous seriousness) is not Jesus Christ or the Virgin Mary or the fallacy in that, but it's a, well, anti-matter cube that will blow up the Vatican City. But it's a MacGuffin that is not used in a way that Hitchcock was so clever about; it's meant to be used as an ideal of science vs. religion, that the Illuminatti are at war with the Catholic Church and are going to use this piece of science and blah blah, whatever. To put it mildly, a MacGuffin like anti-matter would be fine to use if it weren't for the characters and story, which are transparent.Not to go on too much about anti-matter. What should be at focus in this review is something very simple: Angels and Demons is not very exciting as a thriller or a drama, and its twists and turns happen so rapidly, and with so much exposition, you'd swear that the screenwriters were trying to out-exposition Law & Order. Indeed, I wouldn't even blame Dan Brown for the dull jerkiness of the plot, as (having not read the book) I can assume the original text might have been fun if only in that way that Airplane paperback books move along with pieces of food for thought (also, indeed, there's a consensus that Angels and Demons is the *better* book than Da Vinci Code even if it's less controversial). But with cinema, it's something else, and every five minutes we get a ""wait, it's at the chapel"" or ""Wait, no, it's at the church, give me a map!"" or ""No, that's not it, it's in the sewer"" or ""Wait, it's in my hat!""It's a constant string of gotchas that aren't guided by a very suspenseful hand but by a slick Hollywood filmmaker, Ron Howard, who has made some very good movies in his day (Frost/Nixon, Beautiful Mind) and even with his star Tom Hanks (Apollo 13). He's slightly out of his element as he, frankly, hacks his way through the thicket of plot points and explanation with only occasional moments that are striking (i.e. Hanks knocking a book-case against one of those glass windows that's oh-so ever hard to break while losing oxygen in the Vatican archives). And ultimately, I didn't really get out of it what Dan Brown may have wanted me to see, which is the thought-provoking sense of looking at religion and Catholicism and seeing the hypocrisies underneath, OR that science rules and that secretly it wouldn't be a bad thing to let people see that science and academia rules over superstitions that have lasted Millenia too long.Ultimately, it's already leaving my mind for the most part what happened that was ""message"" like or that which was really compelling. It's just another well-oiled but rickety blockbuster machine that will really only please hardcore fans of the book - or those looking for Tom Hanks as a know-it-all superhero.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Angels and demons: Ridiculous,"Everything in this movie is ridiculous: the made up science, the plot, the deaths, the symbols, the script, the accusations, the drawing to conclusions, and the science vs religion debate. Yet it is oddly entertaining, it isn't as anti-Catholic as the bad Da Vinci Code, it does have enough twists and terns, you try to figure out what is going to happen next, you actually care about the characters, it can be oddly funny. It's far from perfect, the ending twist is so ridiculous on such a high scale. For a movie that is 2 hours and 10 minutes, it needs to make interest with the viewer. On the plus side, it is sort-of clever in a way, but not in a way that makes fun of people of science or religion. I think the next time a new pope is about to be decided, we will all be thinking if the angels and demons thing will occur. It won't, because this movie is flat out ridiculous",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Spectacular Movie but Not as phenomenal as The Da Vinci Code,First off do not compare the two movies because it's useless as both were extremely well written and well directed. Angels & Demons had exactly the kind of content I was hoping to see. Although The Da Vinci Code had more mystery this one had more action sequences. Mixing modern Science with ancient history was a brilliant concept. Tom Hanks needs to be applauded for such an amazing acting. He's the reason both movies did so well. I love watching religious mysteries especially in Vatican City especially when it involves the teachings of Pope. I'm not catholic or anything and yet I find it so interesting. I really hope to continue seeing such movies in future.,8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A strong sequel,"Sequels always start behind the eight-ball; they have huge expectations to meet if the first movie is a success. While not quite as good as the first film, this is still a good film that keeps you entertained. This movie is fiction, but it definitely helps to be interested in history and religion. Strong acting performances all around. An interesting plot, but you do need to take a leap of faith for at least a part of it. If you do not like violence, I suggest this film is not for you. There was a much higher amount of violence in this film compared to its predecessor.

Exciting Action and Suspense,"15 May 2009. With time, a second reflection on this movie, reveals an ending series of sequences that is much more consistent with the spectacular and the nexus between science and religion and the motivation of the Conclave's Pontiff's decision-making steps that it takes towards the end of the movie. The balance of climatic fireworks and the rather more than usual mundane storyline of a symboligist makes for a much more dramatic and reasoned and authentic piece of work that is able to remain compelling nevertheless, making this movie all the more impressive than originally met the eye, perhaps reaching the boundaries of a classic.May 15, 2009 - Except for an ending twist that really feels unnecessary and manipulative, this sequel has suspense, action, thrills, and chills in a low-tech manner. It brings out both irritation and frustration that by the end is redeemed with satisfaction and mostly acceptance. For critics that find this movie empty-headed, without depth or substance, most action thrillers are similar, great or terrible. The Rock or Transformers. What sets this movie apart, and decently above average is its ability to leave Tom Hank's character as Robert Langton as no superhero with special abilities or powers but an intelligent man who is able to perceive symbols. Unlike most action adventure movies, Tom Hanks and his female sidekick do no more or less than they are able which is plenty. The movie contains scenes that drive one to infuriating frustration by the awfulness of what's occurring but it sure makes the ultimate climax all that more exhilarating. While not a classic, perhaps not even a great movie, this action adventure is decent, has great suspense and thrills and chills that rival such movies as Hannibal, Silence of the Lambs. The pseudo-climax is actually some of the best special effects, literally exploding on the screen. This intellectual movie with action is in the league of National Treasure and Nicholas Cage but with a more sophisticated and oddly enough a stronger emotionally faith-based, not fantasy-based basis for appreciation. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A well made fiction with historical flaws,"As a suspense film I value for its entertaining value. But on the facts of bad Italian and the picturing of Cardinals smoking and a very well shaped young priest as the secretary to the pope (a highly unlikely coincidence)who does not speak Italian well (pronunciation mistakes) and some of the should-be-Italians pronouncing Italian badly render the film a bad and unauthentic taste. Anyway as a person who studies in Italy and who speaks English and Italian, the language barrier (on the part of the actors who act as Italians) was a major flaw. Apart from that the capturing of scenes in the inner walls of Vatican was amazing and is commendable. It's almost impossible to access the inner walls of the Vatican and to be able to see these things (even if they may be wrong up to some extent-I am not an expert on it) is amazing. Overall the film is a very well done and very well acted out fiction, but that which lacks historical credibility.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Same cake, different icing.","First, it's okay entertainment and Tom Hanks is great as usual and the film does follow the novel quite well. The problem is that the cat is out of the bag. What I mean is the film simply can't generate the tension nor the surprizes as did the Da Vinci Code because you already know what to expect from having seen the Da Vinci code. Lastly, the plot lacks the sharp twists and turns which one might expect from a fast moving mystery.Don't get me wrong, it's good entertainment on its own, but you won't be as riveted as you might have been by the Da Vinci code.",7.0,Anonymous,Mystery
This is not the book!,"While reading the book, I was excited to see the movie. The book was super. The movie was a big disappointment. Critical parts were changed or even missing.The setup of the whole story was changed and some characters were totally missing. Symbols were changed in the movie (that's what Robert Langdon is all about). Ron Howard made great movies. But this one just missed it. Credits though on the magnificent scenery and of the Vatican City indoors. The explosion at the end was as expected and really felt like the ""beginning"". Still, highly disappointed.

Don't read the book first!,"Basically, the first thing you need to know is that the vast majority of people who were disappointed by this movie had read the book before seeing it. Of those who hadn't, most responded favourably. I am of the latter group. This movie is a fast-paced but not overwhelming 'follow the clues to beat the clock' type effort with just enough twists and turns to keep you involved right through. In trying to keep up with the book, they didn't really have time to develop the characters but other than Tom Hanks' Robert Langdon, who is successfully developed in The DaVinci Code, this is not a character driven story. While it requires thought to watch and keep up with the story-line, it is not a thought provoking movie. The DaVinci code challenged one's belief in the Catholic church and its teachings and this one had inklings in that direction (most notably the science vs. faith argument) but didn't lean nearly as hard on the viewer to engage the argument as part of the viewing experience.Also of note, the special features included a segment on the creation of the set. Considering the size and historical significance of the locations and the inability to use the actual sites, making this movie was quite a feat.Seriously, though, how can you possibly go wrong with a Tom Hanks and Ron Howard collaboration?But that's just my two scents. ;)",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Good puzzle-solving mystery type movie...,"1st watched 11/23/2010 – 6 out of 10 (Dir-Ron Howard) Good puzzle-solving mystery type movie for about ¾ of the film with a confusing ending. The ending was convoluted but the rest of the movie and the search was good enough to make up for this flaw. This movie is a sequel to the Ron Howard/Tom Hanks original Catholicism thriller called ""The Davinci Code"" with the same author penning the book, Dan Brown. The movie does a great job with pacing and keeping the viewer interested and that's why I recommend the film. The Hanks' character is slightly more agitated and perturbed than in the original but keeps those feeling at bay long enough to care for people in general and help stop the murders of four potential new pope's. The story starts with the current pope dying and the electee's being kidnapped by an anti-catholic group called the Illuminati. Hanks' character is called in to help the church find them and stop their extermination. A side character is an anti-matter expert and helps find a bomb in the Vatican that could potentially blow up the region. Another side character, played by Ewan McGregor was the pope's assistant and the filmmakers play a juggling act with him, as far as how the viewer's perceive him. Other than this, no side stories are introduced and the pacing is quick which helps the movie. Overall, this was a good sequel(in the vein of the National Treasure movies) that was better than the original – in my opinion.",6.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Angels & Demons,"This film is said to have an estimated budget of $150,000,000. When one considers some of the crowd scenes and special effects, that is credible. Nothing else about ""Angels & Demons"" is. To begin with, the founding of the Order of the Illuminati can be dated very precisely to May 1, 1776; Galileo kicked the bucket in 1642, the same year the greatest scientist who ever lived was born, and he died two decades before Adam Weishaupt was born. Doubtless there are many other errors/poetic licences herein, including geographical ones.The most improbable thing about the film is its timescale - no way all this could have been accomplished in the space of a single day, less than a single day.

This movie also did a great job of intertwining new technology with old traditions and mythologies. I also thought it ironic that technology was what ultimately ended up exposing the bad guys plans, and it was technology that he was fighting in the first place.

A long way from angelic but has enough to stop it from being completely demonic,"While it was a long way from perfect, or even great, 'The Da Vinci Code' was better than expected, considering its less than great reputation.Despite being a box office success, 'Angels and Demons' received mixed to negative reviews, and it's not hard to see why. As an adaptation of the book, which also had some imperfections but was an engrossing and intriguing read, 'Angels and Demons' is extremely poor, with much being cut out or dumbed down, giving the film an over-simplified and over-complicated feel. On its own terms, it's just as problematic and, contrary to some opinions expressed here, inferior to 'The Da Vinci Code', sharing some of the same flaws but amplified while making more on the way.'Angels and Demons' to its credit is a great-looking film, being beautifully shot with breath-taking locations that could have been utilised more. Hans Zimmer's music score is haunting and accentuates the thriller mood of the film. Tom Hanks gives his role an easy-going charm, while Ewan McGregor has an earnestness while also trying very hard to give his character plausibility (though the character has too much of the opposite for him to properly succeed).Stellan Skarsgård is similarly strong, as are Victor Alferi and a chilling Nikolaj Lie Kaas.On the other hand, Ayelet Zurer is a charmless and bland substitute for Audrey Tautou, with little to do and giving her worthless dialogue far too much weight. Then there is Armin Mueller-Stahl's very over-acted villain and Pierfrancesco Favino who spends the whole of his screen time looking hopelessly lost.The cast are not helped by their (interesting) characters being reduced to mostly simplistic caricatures, and even those not quite as badly affected are underdeveloped. Nor with a truly corny and clunky script, muddled direction by Ron Howard and a story that feels convoluted, to the point of incomprehensibility in places, and childish with plot twists too obvious.People have said that 'Angels and Demons' had brisker pacing than 'The Da Vinci Code'. Personally, it was partly yes (it is in a way) but largely no. To me the pacing was all over the place, with so many convolutions and parts that feel jumpy it did feel rushed, while the middle act especially lacked urgency and instead dragged like mad.Overall, not without dishonour, and with enough to prevent it from being completely demonic, but very lacklustre and disappointing, with it also falling far short of being angelic. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"It Differs Somewhat From Novel, But It's Still Great!","I did not know what to expect when I first saw this movie. I liked the Da Vinci Code which was close to the book. I read the book, Angels and Demons many times that I know the book word by word. I was first disappointed that the book and movie differ so much, then I realized that I liked the movie because of the intense scenes. Big fans of Dan Brown's novels will be disappointed.Tom Hanks returns as the leading symbologist, Robert Langdon. Langdon is called to Vatican City to help the Swiss Guard uncover antimatter from the grounds beneath and to stop some evil dude from killing and branding four cardinals.The acting and directing are pretty good. I always liked Tom Hanks and Ron Howard so their great performances were no surprise. I was pleasantly surprised at Ewan McGregor. The only movies I liked him in was Black Hawk Down and Star Wars.This movie has plenty of action and intense scenes. These won't disappoint big fans of action. I liked the score of Hans Zimmer especially the solo violin solos. Overall, this was a great movie though not accurate to the book. I rate this movie 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"If the dramatic changes from book to screen are overlooked, it is actually a really cool film!","There's something about Dan Brown and his books that make him sort of Michael Moore's best friend, intellectually-wise. With each of his works, he tries to expose a large and important area of society or corporation and make it the latest scandal or controversy. A few years ago, Ron Howard made a film about Brown's ""The Da Vinci Code"" and it immediately stirred controversy and heated discussion in many countries because of its views exposed towards the church, and of course, no one even mentioned the incredibly creative plot or the masterful writing, but only the religious content. Never mind that Ron Howard (who used to be one of my favourite directors) left the film almost devoid of any of the charm and suspenseful wit the book possessed; but whatever. Dan Brown's other book, ""Angels & Demons"", the prequel to his Da Vinci Code has now been transformed into a movie, with Ron Howard directing again...and that's enough to make anxious Brown fans flock to the movie theaters, biting their nails in apprehension.Okay, I know that my job as a film reviewer is to review the film itself, without taking the book as one of the primordial points I should focus on, but before we go on with the review, I just have to get this out of my system: The book is an amazing masterpiece, expertly constructed and so engrossing you actually find yourself reading it all through the night and arriving next day at work with soggy eyes but a content expression. Those of you who are fans of the book and want to see the movie, be warned- it should contain a message that says ""this film is loosely based on the book by Dan Brown"", because it changes so many things and modifies so much plot that the book and the movie could at some point seem like two completely different things. But what can you expect from a two-hour-and-change film directed by Ron Howard? Having said that, let's continue the review.Leaving the immense differences between the book and the movie apart, you would have to admit that the film isn't all that bad, really. Yes, we have Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), the symbologist we've all come to love, who's an erudite and know-it-all respectable professor at Cambridge, and who's written, ooh, tons of books and articles. There's this gigantic nuclear lab somewhere in Europe where top scientists from around the world create the most innovative (and sometimes unbelievable) things; a short number of these scientists are working on the creation of antimatter (the opposite of matter) which could explain the origins of creation and which could become a valuable source of energy. And there's also an important event going on in the Vatican City, namely conclave, where the Pope has died and the world sits still until a new Pope is elected.Then, a scientist in the nuclear lab is killed, a canister with a small spec of antimatter (which could blow up and entire city) is stolen and suddenly appears to be hidden somewhere in the Vatican City. The people who stole this powerful source of energy and destruction call themselves The Illuminati, an ancient and long-forgotten sect, who have sworn that the four principal cardinals of the Catholic church are to be executed prior to the antimatter canister blowing up at midnight of the same day. And who do you call to solve a crime and stop a terrorist plot involving a long-dead sect? None other than our dear Robert Langdon who, we're not surprised to learn, is an expert in their symbology and history.Well, that's the premise. What follows is another version of the puzzle-solving, car-chasing, suspense-inducing, church-terrorizing, quick-thinking ""Da Vinci Code""...only better and more believable. At least you can rest easy knowing that Ron Howard has made this film into a truly enjoyable experience, and he has learned from his mistakes in his previous film to make this into something you can actually cheer and applaud to. The film is fast-paced but well-structured, expertly acted, intelligent and witty beyond measure. The production design, cinematography and costume design merge to transport us into a breath-taking guided tour through Rome, the Vatican City, and the people and customs involved therein. Hans Zimmer's score is fabulous, transforming his original Da Vinci score into a wonderful listening experience, at times exciting and heart-pounding, at times otherworldly and heart-wrenching.Yes, truth be told, I really liked the movie. Even the changes that were made from the book to screen are acceptable (because if nothing had been changed, then we would be staring at a five-hour movie, at least). In conclusion, it is better than the Da Vinci Code, it is one of Ron Howard's most entertaining movies, and an all-around fun experience at the movies this year.Rating: 3 stars out of 4!",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Another Failed Attempt,"Angels and Demons seems to be yet another failed attempt at converting a Dan Brown novel to the big screen. I am going to add myself to the growing ranks of people who are all stating that the film is not as good as the book , which is a premise I had fully accepted before I even sat in my seat in the cinema. However after watching the film I have realized that making this film was bound to fail as there too much to squeeze into 120 Hollywood minutes.I expected the essence of the book to be extracted such as the story of CERN and the creation of ant-matter unfortunately this was dealt with in roughly about 10 minutes, of which 5 minutes consisted of long panning shots of the Large Hydron Collider. This is a glaring omission as the creation of anti-matter and the history of CERN creates the backdrop to the science versus religion debate which is what drives the film.Where the film falls down the worst is that it completely fails to capture the excitement of Robert Langdon trying to discover the Illuminatis path to enlightenment which is an amazing cryptic puzzle spread right across Rome. Instead we are faced with Tom Hanks running from statue to statue shouting at people followed closed by Vittoria Vetra, who is possibly the most one dimensional character I have seen played in a long time she basically had no need to be in the film, her character was that badly written.All in all the film is entertaining to watch but will not be remembered and is definitely not a classic. However if you have read the book you will be disappointed so hopefully it will be the last time we will see Robert Langdon symbologist on our big screens.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A brilliant book adaptation!,"The Da Vinci Code was a film that was far too over analytical making it slow and losing tense and pace unlike the book. Angels and Demons has an entirely different outset. It still explores the story efficiently but is more fast paced, tense and leaves room for more action and thrills. Ron Howard has expertly and correctly kept truly faithful to the book. Tom Hanks delivers another excellent performance as Robert Langdon and I was very impressed with Ewan McGregor as the Camerlengo and the script and dialogue is sharp and the twist at the end is unexpected unless you have read the book. This should appeal to intellects and fans of the books.Obviously Dan Brown's books have stirred up lots of controversy particularly Angels and Demons among the Catholic community, which is fair enough. It can be very insulting in that sense, but as an atheist I wasn't bothered and lets face it at the end of the day the idea that any of this could happen of the Camerlengo poisoning his own Pope and using anti-matter to reunite religion is so absurd, it comes on to the extreme of preposterousness. So as a result I don't take it seriously and just see it as trashy entertainment, though it is a bit off putting that a lot of the facts Brown associates with the book as true actually aren't, but I was happy to look past it. Overall I loved this movie but I can certainly see why this is would divide opinion not just with religious Catholics, but fans of the book. But I thought it was brilliant anyway. Go and see it and make up your own mind.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Better than The DaVinci Code,"Angels and Demons is the adaptation of the novel of the same name written by Dan Brown , the same person that wrote The DaVinci Code and as well as he DaVinci Code it is directed by Ron Howard and with Tom Hanks in the leading role. This one is way better the the previous one but it isn't that great to impress. Angels and Demons is a very well structure thriller with lots of action, adventure and suspense. It has a fast rhythm, a convincing and interesting story, although I think it has some holes that if you're not paying attention you will get bore very easy.The digital effects are extraordinary that in some way compensates the lack of story. The locations are excellent, maybe the best of the movie. Watching every street, every corner and every church of Vatican City is really impressive and interesting. The cast is really good. Tom Hanks repeating in the role of Robert Langdon, in this second movie he is more an action hero than a respectable scientist but still a very good performance. Ewan McGregor was excellent as Camerlengo McKenna, it was a very powerful performance and Ayelet Zurer was good but with very little presence.

Somewhat gimmicky but very good,"Prof Langdon (Hanks) has 4-hrs to locate the kidnapped Cardinals and find the bomb that will destroy the Vatican.I stopped reading Robert Ludlum novels (The Bourne this and that) as my page-turning hand couldn't keep up with the breakneck pace of the clues given. As I watched this movie I was reminded of the Ludlum novels and saw the parallels. Once the first clues were given we were off to the races. The music also played a big part and helped us run around Rome like a Wild Mouse (a ride at Coney Island) on the loose. The clues and the music made the 2+hours seem like minutes. It was over so quick. What a ride.Basically, this is a movie that tries to show the differences between Science and Religion. The Science part presents itself in the guise of a secret society called the Illuminati, who have been around for hundreds of years. The Religion part is represented by the Catholic Church.I call this somewhat gimmicky only because of the racing around to get to the next clue to discovering where the kidnapped Cardinals are and ultimately to where the bomb is too, but this is an excellent production. We get to see a lot of Rome ( I would also suggest you pause the DVD for those moments so you can get a good look). The acting is first rate by all. Also, the dialogue makes us feel privy to the inner workings of the Vatican. And, there is humor injected as well.Now, the getting around Rome traffic (to get to he next clue) in a matter of mere minutes is sheer Movie Magic. Can't be done. Been there, done that.I didn't know there was a person called the Camerlengo (McGregor) who has the power of the Papacy when a Pope dies and until a new Pope is elected.Of course, near the end of the movie all is revealed and there is a twist I didn't see coming.

I got exactly what I wanted,"Well, I really enjoyed this film. But, I will start with the bad things. So, I thought the screenplay was mediocre. And because of this fact, it was obvious who the bad guy/villain was.For me, a very important thing in movies or movie series, is the time line. So Angels & Demons by Dan Brown was written in 2000, while The Da Vinci Code in 2003. So, and I also think Brown stated this, The Da Vinci Code is Angels & Demons's sequel. But speaking for the films, The Da Vinci Code was adapted for the screen in 2006 and 3 years later in 2009 this movie that I am reviewing now. At first I thought they made a prequel, but I read somewhere that they changed the time line from the books, so they actually made Angels & Demons, the sequel for The Da Vinci Code. It is a little confusing.So related to this, if it is actually a prequel, then I must say that Tom Hanks actually looks older. So unless the makeup artist was an idiot it is indeed a sequel.I know most people said that it is better than the first film because the first one was kind of boring and the action was mainly composed of Tom Hanks talking. I disagree. The first film kept me entertained the whole time. And, like this one, it was a 2 and a half hours movie. I think both films are great and you should probably have them in your ""movie archive"".What was my opinion, more concrete, relating to the dilemma on which of the films was better?

"One very good feature, the rest rather mediocre","Unfortunately for Ewan Mcgregor, he is the lone star of this film. He was able to portray the character nearly exactly like I envisioned him in the book. He also got in character, unlike Tom Hanks who felt awkward trying to portray an academic. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is a great actor, but I like his off-beat comedy the best (The Burbs, Joe Vs. the Volcano, etc). He did some war films OK. But this role would have been better to be played by somebody with a little more bookish gravitas. All other aspects of the film were sub-par, including the story by Dan Brown, the screenplay, the acting, and the choice of changes from the text. That said, Ewan Mcgregor made the film quite watchable, and had a memorable verging on extraordinary performance.I was not put off by the special effects, which were fine; nor was I put off by the montage of Rome, which I thought rather beautiful, but this particular film necessitates story above all else, and the story is simply not a plausible one.

Tom Hanks didn't fit our mental image of the suave central character, Robert Langdon and like many modern action movies based on decent novels, it short-formed or omitted too many of the best loved plot details.Ironical, Brown's less well crafted earlier novel Angels & Demons came to the screen as a far more satisfying film and fled to DVD far faster. Let's face it, worse novels frequently make better films, both because they may rely more on visuals and action than mental development and because there are fewer invidious comparisons to make. Hanks as an EARLIER Robert Langdon (several remarks in the film make the time frame of the story which was supposed to take place BEFORE the DaVinci Code ambiguous at least - and those who know both books will try to ignore these or face the disappointment of the negation of the relationship with Sophie) is fitter and more like the Langdon of the novels - he has to be in this far more active role. The less complex plot for Angels... has fewer ""codes"" to be missed, and the one major plot revision between page and screen actually makes more sense than Brown's original even though it allows a supporting character (the perfectly cast Ewen McGregor as the Camerlengo) to ""take stage"" from Langdon (it had to do with the well filmed helicopter climax).Like The DaVinci Code and all those earlier James Bond thriller/travelogues, Angels & Demons takes us to exotic places (here in and around Rome and Vatican City) and while the set designers actually recreated a majority of them for filming, they did their job beautifully and even those of us who have been there can enjoy ravishing revisits to favorite places along with the action.Of course there are the inevitable plot holes which the flesh and action films are heir to (in all probability no mortal man could cover the ground specified in the time allowed and the effect of the specified bomb is basically incalculable and fudged for effect in the film), but Director Howard and plotter Brown keep us too visually and mentally occupied to care.For anyone who likes action films intelligent enough to allow thought on a higher plane than the Disney/Bruckheimer misfire, G Force, Angels & Demons is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Detective Murder Thriller... Catholic Style,"An 8 might be a bit of a stretch, but in my opinion this is the best of the trilogy and I have the other two ranked at a 7.Tom Hanks in fine and trim in this fast paced thrilling sequel, which was a welcomed change from 'The Da Vinci Code'. Instead of being pursued, he's doing the pursuing, all within the beautiful confines of Vatican City, at least the CGI version of it. Other than a few scenes they did a very good job of recreating those iconic sites, and even the ones you can tell are computer generated they're still done quite well and not very noticeable.As exciting as the film is, it's at the expense of being realistic. There are many over the top moments, or scenes that just don't add up, whether it's timing or police operations.Visually it's beautiful, and well acted.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Monotonous, overlong, and not as exciting as it should have been","While watching Ron Howard's adaptation of Dan Brown's Angels and Demons, I find myself inevitably comparing the film to the TV series 24. Similar to the plot of a typical season of 24, Angels and Demons finds its protagonist (portrayed in this film by Tom Hanks) attempting to solve an improbably convoluted mystery in an extremely limited amount of time, a mystery riddled with betrayals, narrow escapes, and explosions. However, while 24 for the most part succeeds in its efforts to convey a sense of suspense and entertainment as its plot-line gradually unfolds, Angels and Demons ultimately fails to convey any sort of real suspense and mystery behind its ostensibly high-octane whodunit that unravels in the streets of Rome.Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) is called upon by a wary Vatican College of Cardinals to help them solve the symbology-fueled mystery behind the abduction of four leading Catholic Cardinals in lieu of the election of a new pope. Joining Landgon in his mission is CERN physicist Vittoria Vetra (Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer; think an older, blander physical clone of Anne Hathaway), who for her part is investigating both the theft of a canister of antimatter from the CERN laboratory in Switzerland as well as investigating the death of a colleague at CERN, who just happens to be a priest that the recently-deceased pope held in high regard due to his efforts to prove the existence of God using science. Aiding them in their endeavor is head of the Vatican Swiss Guard Richter (Stellan Skarsgård) and the deceased pope's Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor).The prospect of a fast-paced race against time to uncover the plot behind the abduction of the Cardinals as well as a plot to destroy the Vatican is certainly a promising premise. Oddly enough, this movie, in which the science vs. religion, faith vs. fact debate is largely center stage, lacks a real heart and soul.The script of the movie subtracts most of the character development found in the book in order to cram as much tedious description of the symbology and obvious exposition of the clues in the mystery as possible. Because of the film's insistence of spoon-feeding every last detail of the mystery to its audience, as well as the film's insistence of removing all sense of subtext in the film by exhaustively delineating the science vs. religion debate every chance it gets, the pacing of the film is unnecessarily slowed down, which contributes largely to the lack of any real suspense in the movie.In movies that are as fast-paced as this film aspires to be, character development is often regarded as an afterthought by the screenwriters and understandably so. However, as was the case in The Da Vinci Code, it is such an afterthought in this movie that the actors seem more like props than characters, there merely to advance the supposed mystery from one scene to the next, with any sense of motivation or personality in the characters almost feeling completely irrelevant to the screenwriters. As a result, every character in the movie was painfully one-dimensional. Though not quite as wooden as his first bout as Robert Langdon, the considerable talents of Tom Hanks largely go to waste once again in this film; the hints of personality he attempts to inject into the role are refreshingly welcome but unfortunately few and far in between. Zurer's character does little more than follow Hanks around from scene to scene. Skarsgård's police captain grumbles a lot. McGregor's Camerlengo mopes and paces a lot.The lack of three-dimensional characters would be forgivable if the action of the film was actually exciting and fun to watch. But it's simply not the case in this film. The film stubbornly sticks to the formula of Hanks and co. running around Rome looking at statues and monuments, talking about hidden symbols, watching someone die, then running to another part of Rome to repeat the process, interrupted periodically by McGregor making heavy-handed conversation with members of the College of Cardinals. This monotony lasts up until the film's final act, which as absurd and far-out as it is, is welcome relief from the monotony of watching Hanks run around Rome and McGregor wringing his hands inside St. Peter's Basilica.The film runs an exhausting two-and-a-half hours, about two-thirds of that time devoted to long-winded speeches by the characters about symbolism and science vs. religion. With all due respect to Mr. Hanks (one of my favorite actors) and co., my idea of a fun summer movie is not two-plus hours of college freshman-level pseudo-philosophy and pseudo-history with the occasional car chase and murder thrown in for good measure.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
On your seat the whole movie!,"I have never read the novel this movie was based on but the film is excellent. The filming in Paris is well laid out and fulfills the whole story line well. The theme is well hidden but found toward the end of the film. Though a dark lit movie, it falls in line with the film before it of The Da Vinci Code. Well played and a film that keeps you guessing and wanting to know the outcome throughout.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) comes back as the symbol guru. Once the pope dies it is time to select the new pope. Tying in with a science experiment, the Illuminati has a mystery involved in it and Langdon is sent for in order to get through the clues of the event. I believe the theme is directed to secrets in high places.Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) is the daughter of the physicist that discovered a destructive weapon that may get into the wrong hands. Vittoria's father is killed and the clues begin. Langdon and Vetra team up to find out the clues to discover the secret behind the weapon all while seeing how the Illuminati ties in or if it even does.All while the clues are being deciphered there is a killer on the loose. This killer is linked to one of the hidden secrets of the two problems that Langdon and Vetra are trying to get to the bottom of. All together there is a lot going on.Camera angles aid in discovering who is intended to be seen doing what. There were times I would catch myself noticing things outside the main characters. These things I caught helped me follow more closely what was exactly going on. The angles were not noticed until I watched the movie another timeThis movie had me on thinking mode the whole time. Wondering why, how, and when was a fun aspect of watching the film. Camera angles and certain scenes were clues to certain aspects of the film. Sound was good and lighting was dark as stated before. Some of the scenes were darker than I would like but the way it is done it helps you focus on the shot and get only what the film maker intended you to get. The darkness plays well with the films intention.This movie calls for close attention. There are secrets in high places. There are different things going on in the movie that you must keep up with for the whole movie to make sense. Overall this movie was one worth watching again and again to catch other things I had missed before.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Angels? Demons?,"It may just be me, but from the trailer I was given the impression that this film would have Angels and Demons battling it out in brilliant CGI, but there was no such thing. As a matter of fact there wasn't a single angel or demon the entire way through. How ridiculous is that? It could quite possibly be the most misleading title and trailer combo I have ever seen!What this film is, as it turns out, is a lazy, unimaginative, bland and boring waste of time. From beginning to end it feels like the film makers didn't even try and the story was beyond bad. There were no interesting characters, no great acting performances, no stunning visuals, and not even a decent soundtrack. It's a poorly put tougher and very boring film that would be lucky to engage even the most easily amused viewers.",1.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Rushed mess spewing nonsense,"One of those movies you forgot you just watched. Hilariously funny in the worst way, yet one of the most blur feeling movies I have seen in a while.Angels and Demons is one of those book to movie deals that just plainly don´t work. If you are a fan of Dan Brown you know what draws you into his books. All the conspiracy talk, all the fascinating facts all the vivid descriptions of things and in this movie it´s just spewed out of Robert Langdon without any context. If you are not a fan of Dan Brown I think you´ll find this hilarious and stupid. I am one that enjoys the books even though I see them as flawed but this isn't a book review. This movie is a rushed adaptation and a cipnotes version of the story in the worst way possible.After a canister of antimatter has been stolen, the illuminati reveals themselves after a long slumber, only here to destroy the Vatican. Robert Langdon is called in to help solve the case of where the animater is and to find the path of illumination in order to find cardinals that have been kidnapped.The beginning of this movie is a bit of a drag and really does nothing to create tension and engagement. It makes the movie feel like a blur as events just kind of happen or else we have no movie. It does nothing to set up motivations, explain anything well or create any characters to latch on to. The only reason this movie has some resemblance of likeability is because of the interesting ""facts"" thrown towards the viewer. It´s incorporated poorly and makes Robert Langdon more of a fact book than a character as he spews random babble out throughout the runtime. While this is interesting it´s not explained or explored enough to have any marid, it´s just here so the viewer felt like they learned something here.The movies pacing is also terrible. Slowing down and speeding up at random. The urgency is never felt and when it finally hits the characters take a small break like that´s normal. The entire chase, mystery and solutions to the riddles are solved in two seconds and the movie feels like it moves at lighting speed sometimes never really catching the attention of the viewer. It´s slow parts also feel dragging and this movie doesn't feel like it´s taking as long as it is, but doesn't feel out it´s runtime with anything interesting. Why is anything happening? Why the branding? Why these statues? Why this building? Doesn't matter! On with the movie!There are no characters to cling to here. Everyone is extremely surfaced leveled and has no time to develop a character let alone have any trades other than ""woman"" or ""symbols guy"" or ""police"". Top this off with really terrible performances and you have a poorly character driven movie with bad performances by rather talented people. There are so many times another take would have helped but there is also a dialect coach missing from this movie. The accents are all over the place with no consistency or logic.The CGI in this movie is not good. When the actors are standing in a fake room it looks computer generated and when the crowds get zoomed into just a little too much you see the fakeness. This movies practical parts look decent enough but the CGI is really bad.The movie feels rushed but at the same time a drag. It really feels like not a lot is happening as the movie feels rather set in stone up until the last 20 minutes. It can´t carry this week plot with poor explanation and it becomes more of a checklist rather than a mystery.The interesting dilemma and concept of this movie is not handled well here. This is because of the rushed nature where nothing gets time to really sink in or get´s a longer than 5 minute conversation. The concept of church vs science. Tradition vs renewal. Both discussions that are interesting but isn't explained well here.This movie all of a sudden has some red herrings and they are too obvious that it hurts. The problem is not having them it´s the way they are framed and that they get introduced more or less right after each other. Also if you have watched any mystery movie before, the culprit is rather obvious.This movie has a rather good soundtrack, but it´s misused constantly in this movie. It´s kind of baffling how much it´s fails at that. Having intense music continuing after the intense part is over. Having intense music playing when nothing is happening. It happens a couple of times.Returning to Angel and Demons I don´t know what I liked about it back then. Maybe it was to watch a book I like come to life. Maybe it was the cast I liked. Maybe it was the idea the movie presented; I don't know. But Now I know I think this movie is a rushed mess in both literal and production sense. It´s really poorly done in so many areas it all mixes and become a laughable experience.",2.0,Anonymous,Mystery

The book is always better but still it remains a good movie,I don't get why people would bash this movie. They must not have seen a lot of movies then because there are tons of worse movies. I am not going to say that the movie was better then the book because that is certainly not true. But that's not something new because almost every book is better then the movie itself. But if you don't feel like reading books then the movie Angels & Demons is a good alternative for a nice evening relaxing in your couch. The entire movie is just one big pursuit after finding the necessary clues in religious books or history. The battle between science and religion is forever and it's also the major point in the movie. Being a convinced atheist myself I had fun watching those ridiculous religious superstitions.

Much better than the DVC,"Ron Howard does much better in his second shot at Dan Brown's pulp history/sci-fi/conspiracy/religious thrillers. The scenes are paced much better while still including some great cinematographic shots of Rome and the Vatican. This might be due to trimming down some of the historical conspiracies and their meanings. While these historical ponderings were key to a good deal of the excitement and suspense that Brown created in his novels, I think they disrupted the pace of the action in the DVC.With a leaner story, A&D moves much better as a movie than the DVC. Purists may take some offense to this, but imho, movies should be made with a movie audience in mind. Trimming the story to make for a better movie is perfectly fine and quite a few other novel adaptations could / would have benefited from this deed (e.g. Harry Potter).",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"Better than Da Vinci, but still not great","Is anyone else increasingly tired of Ewan McGregor's trite mannerisms and being stuck with his own brand of non-acting in film after film? Unfortunately, he's a major presence in ANGELS & DEMONS, Ron Howard's follow-up to his DA VINCI CODE. Tom Hanks returns as Professor Robert Langdon, and this is based on another Dan Brown novel.The good news is that it's better than the awful DA VINCI CODE, but then it couldn't exactly be worse. ANGELS & DEMONS has pace in the first hour and style in places, and some interesting snippets of historical information thrown into the mix, although it's still saddled with the same problems as its predecessor; namely, that the clever-clever plot which tries to be so intricate all the way through actually turns out to be incredibly simplistic and naive come the end. It's also incredibly overlong, and dull in places.It's admirably vicious for a family film, with all manner of nasty deaths that in some ways recall the SAW franchise, a clear inspiration here. Tom Hanks is also better, more relaxed and at the same time more believable in his role. However, the shonky script wastes the talents of the likes of Stellan Skarsgard and the other cast members like Armin Mueller-Stahl, and it gets increasingly ludicrous as it goes on, reaching a nadir with the ridiculously cheesy effects of the helicopter finale.

"Not as Original as Da-Vinci Code,but Filled with Unexpected Twists,","Angels and Demons is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.It's considered a sequel to the Da-Vinci Code but Robert Langdon is really the only thing these two movies have in common,the movie have basically no connection and you could easily watch this without seeing the Da-Vinci Code.The movies storyline is very different as well at in a religious perspective it definitely wouldn't be as offensive,but I still wouldn't recommend religious people watch it.Tom Hanks delivers a performance as Robert Langdon just as good as before,he is without a doubt one of my all time favourite actors,he never fails to amaze me,I was also very impressed with Ayelet Zurer and Ewan McGregor,this was a very different character for him and he did a great job.I would recommend Angels and Demons to all fans of the Da- Vinci Code,but don't expect it to be just as good,also to all fans of mystery and thriller's.Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is assigned by the Vatican to solve a case against the Illuminati that plan to attack the Vatican,starting by killing each cardinal.",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Very interesting film with complex story line,"After hearing about this films release and good reviews about it's prequel (The Da Vinci Code) I had high expectations when going to watch Angels and Demons, and I wan't disappointed....This film follows a Harvard university Symbologist, Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) on his quest to prevent the murders of Catholic Cardinals. This fast pace thriller takes you on a tour or Rome and the Vatican exploring churches, cathedrals and famous monuments.I have to admit, this film took 2-3 watches to understand fully. Writer Dan Brown put some immense time and effort into writing the book, and he did not fail to impress.For anyone who has watched Da Vince code, has an interest in history, or just likes fast paced thriller/action/drama films, I would strongly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Mystery
must watch.... Some say the book is better. But its a great film,"It's a thriller based on a novel by Dan Brown directed by Ron Howard. As the story is of Brown there's no need of mentioning how great it is. The best thing about Dan's stories is that they make extensive use of interesting historical data, dire true facts. There is another signature style of his novels and therefore the movies based on them, they have two climaxes. All it needed was a proper script and that has been brilliantly prepared by David Koepp and Akiva Goldsman. This good piece of work by Ron gives a beautiful experience and it is elevated by the amazing violin Ã°Å¸Å½Â» solos by Joshua Bell.... Definitely #mustWatch....",8.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Horrible Adaptation of an Amazing Book,"Let me first start off that the book Angels and Demons may be my favorite novel of all time and I recommend it to all. I was also extremely excited to see this film. As to not include spoilers I will not reveal any plot elements but I will say that crucial elements of the book were altered or just completely left out for no apparent reason. There was no emotion at all, and there was no reason to feel for any of the characters, when before I cared and understood the motives of every single character. I feel that book was raped and pillaged to make a movie quickly and profitably. I realize that I went into the movie with a prejudice, and could not just watch the movie without the book being in the back of my mind, but I did try and every time I saw a scene where the film makers could redeem themselves they just continued to make the movie worse.

Thank Heaven for Symbologists!,"If you thought ""The Da Vinci Code"" was stupid, have a look at this unspeakably ludicrous sequel.Howard & Co. surely were (made) aware of what a huge bore their first Dan Brown adaptation had been, so they switched to full throttle mode for this follow-up. But ironically, that didn't change a bit. All the hectic bustling around doesn't generate a shred of suspense, since the basic premise is so stupid one doesn't even attempt getting attached to the storyline. So you just stare at the screen in disbelief at how much time and money went into filming this piece of dreck.

"Not quite disastrous, but dangerously close","Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, dedicated cryptologist and all-around smartest guy in the room, just in time to save Catholicism from conspiracy and MacGuffin alike. The film moves at a rapid pace, and excels at white-knuckled, buzzer-beating thrills, but it's got problems. Not the least of which is Langdon himself, who spouts like a broken nozzle atop the fountain of knowledge for the duration. OK, we get it, he's exceptionally smart and this is what he does best, but his act quickly grows redundant and tiresome. Not only does he know all the answers almost as soon as the riddle presents itself, robbing the audience of the joy of working anything out for themselves, he's also immediately ready to fire off a lengthy dissertation about the relevant historical figures, masterpieces and religious movements while muscling about various set pieces. That evil becomes necessary when the film quickly paints itself into a corner, setting a merciless time limit on each puzzle that pushes suspension of disbelief right out the window. Now, not only are we unraveling mysteries older than recorded time in less than sixty minutes, but we're also visiting libraries, slicing through political red tape and effortlessly navigating the whole of Vatican City, swamped by humanity in the midst of a papal election. Despite all that, I still held the film in good graces until the calamitous final act, which is capped by exploding helicopters, ludicrous swerves and a parachutin' pilot priest. More generic than The Da Vinci Code, it places a much heavier emphasis on nail-biting than convention-challenging, which is a shame because that's precisely the trait that set the original apart. .",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
An entertaining film...just  not the great one it could have been,First and foremost Angels & Demons has lots missing from the book where pages upon pages seem to have been left on the script floor and for good reason otherwise it would have stretched into a 4 hour movie! And soon becomes apparent this where director Ron Howard seems to have changed tactics from the first offering of the Dan Brown franchise in that the Da Vinci code left you constantly confused at times as this doesn't and he serves up an action paced average thriller. The story centres around Harvard Symbologist Robert Langdon (Hanks) who is summoned by the Vatican (after the sudden death of the pope) to solve a new threat involving a small problem of anti-matter which gets stolen from the infamous CERN by an ancient secret brotherhood known as the Illuminati who along the way have kidnapped four cardinals.Teaming up with Langdon to play this cat and mouse game is CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Zurer) who thought would have been a bit of a love interest for Langdon...but no thankfully Howard doesn't allow for this.The other main character in the film is Irish speaking Patrick Mckenna played by Ewan McGregor who appears as the villain from a long way off but McGregor does giving a convincing performance in this role.So as Langdon and Vetra rush from cathedral to cathedral solving the puzzles in the eight hour time-frame before the anti-matter explodes wiping out the entire city and it is here that Ron Howard gives the film its best bits with stunning sets of Rome and it is quite easily to see that this is where most of the budget as been spent.There are two problems with the end of the film which appear very unbelievable as you will see for yourself if you choose to watch it.I think Ron Howard sold stick to make first rate films such as Apollo Thirteen and Frost\Nixon and next time leave the Dan Brown novels at home because it is to clear to see it hasn't worked with the first two outings.To summarise then if you want be entertained for two and a bit hours by an average thriller then please go and watch A&D but don't expect the book version and remember as with all great novels....they do not always make great films.,5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Adequate & Dull,"You just can't keep a good symbologist down, apparently, no matter how hard the religious ne'er-do-wells try. Dr. Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is back to decoding religious symbols in an attempt to save the world, or some aspect of it at the very least. This time he is helping the Vatican decode a plot hatched by the Illuminati against the Catholic Church (timed with the Pope's death) as retribution for the church's mistreatment of the secret society centuries ago. Now they are wreaking their revenge by threatening the lives of four cardinals, and ultimately, blowing up Vatican City with a nifty little stolen gadget called anti- matter and it's up to Langdon to find and solve the clues in a four hour time span.With all due respect to the millions of people who read this book and went nuts for it, there was absolutely nothing about this story that I found interesting. Though I actually really enjoyed reading The Da Vinci Code (and this is the first and last time I'll compare the two novels/movies) and had high hopes for this book, when I tried reading Angels and Demons I couldn't get through the first 30 pages without giving up because I found it to be incredibly boring. I can barely even keep my eyes open reading the synopsis I wrote about the movie and that's my own writing. I didn't buy that they were working urgently (it seemed like an hour was more like a ""movie hour"" of about an hour and a half at least) and found the developments and ""twists"" so obvious that I entertained myself by pretending I was as smart as Langdon and could figure out the riddles just because the camera pointed out the answer to me. (""Of course it's under the floor – one of the three dozen angels' arrows is pointing right at the spot!"") And speaking of predictability, I was once again intellectually offended by a filmmaker forcing several possible villains down my throat in a bid to be suspenseful. Honestly, good writing and direction is all you need, not five people giving furtive sidelong glances like the shifty-eyed dog on The Simpsons.The acting in the film was decent, though certainly not inspired. Tom Hanks always seems very natural in his films, and I was pleased to see one of my favorite contemporary actors, the under-valued Stellan Skarsgard in the film. Once again, however, the female lead (Ayelet Zurer) was completely ineffectual and Ewan McGregor simply chewed scenery without a lot of panache. I also don't know when Armin Mueller-Stahl become completely unintelligible, but I couldn't tell you most of what he said in the film because I couldn't understand a word he said.Having completely bagged on the story and an elderly German actor, I do now have to admit that the movie was actually somewhat easy to watch, if only in an ""I don't feel like I'm completely wasting my time"" way, the same way I will watch a Lifetime Movie Network flick to fall asleep. Realizing this sounds fairly negative, one has to look at Ron Howard's films in general: They are always easy to watch but not challenging, and adequate but not exciting. Unless someone is really interested in a subject matter that he covers, I think that his films tend to be the culinary equivalent of a Little Debbie snack cake. They are good when you're hungry, but other things are so much better; yet, you know what you're getting into when you take a bite. I really enjoyed Frost/Nixon after seeing it, but I'm also a history nerd, and the interesting thing about that movie was after seeing all of the other Best Picture nominees of last year, it quickly fell to a definite last place in the running for me. On a definite positive note, however, I can say that, whether the locations were simulated or not, as an art and architecture lover I thought the location shots were great, and my experience was further enhanced by my parents leaning over occasionally to whisper, ""We were there!""I can't completely pan Angels and Demons, but I also don't have a lot of good things to say about it either. The best thing I can truly say about it is that it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, which is sometimes all you can ask for in a summer popcorn flick.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Ron Howard what were you thinking,"I would vote lower but 1 was as low as they go. At least the Da Vinci code was close to the book. There were a few changes but the major points were held to. Angels and demons however is quite another story. I thought the book was a lot more action packed than the Da Vinci code and had so much more potential as a film. From the opening scene Ron Howard departed from the book and preceded to destroy it. The direction he took, he might as well have changed the title of the film since it no longer resembled the title it was supposed to be.

Not only was I sorely disappointed, I was frustrated that so much money and acting talent had been squandered on what was basically quite a good premise for a blockbuster.Ron Howard's Directorial debut is a mess.One of the ironies of ""suspension of disbelief"" is that you have to earn that right through believability.It is at this level that things fail.So a bomb is set to go off that will wipe out the whole of the Vatcian City - thats fine, i'm on board for the ride.But Howard fails to convince from start to finish. Why should Tom Hanks, as hero Robert Langdon, risk life and limb ? Why are murders committed in the fountains of busy piazza's with none of the bystanders noticing? At the end, how can the injured bad guy standing only a few feet away from Langdon and the massed ranks of Vatican Security outrun them for the finale ? The setting is superb and the visuals lush.The action sequences are numerous and well executed.Yet Hanks is lacklustre and the story told in such a preposterous way that I simply lost interest rousing myself to pay attention when Howard desperately injected another adrenaline shot into a fading corpse.At 2 hours and fifteen minutes with too much money and time, Howard is lazy and fails in the fundamental skill of telling a good story.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Pain in the Brain ...,"I didn't read the book that this movie is based on, so I had no idea what to expect going in. What I found was a movie with a great opening and ending, but with a painful experience for all the time in between.For me, most of the movie consisted of Tom Hanks motor-mouthing a barrage of historical references and connections I had no understanding of. It was too fast and detailed to make any sense of.Of course, I understood the overall plot: the race to find 4 Vatican cardinals before they are executed, as well as an antimatter bomb before it explodes in Vatican City.But again, the convoluted ""aha"" moments of the lead character (Hanks) were so incomprehensible that all I could do was to watch as he went from one place to another. At that level of viewing, the movie was formulaic and boring.The only saving grace of this movie was the brief opening sequence and the ending segment.

I want to go to a movie to relax and enjoy it and I'm tired of having to work to make out what's going on. It seems that directors have opted for darker shots so they don't have to work as hard on the scene make-up. I for one am tired of it! I was also a little disappointed that this movie didn't have the depth of interest and intrigue as the first one.

Needs a Trilogy to really make it work!,My Rating : 5/10I just finished reading the book and then watching the movie afterwards - it is certainly one of the best thriller books I've read - so I was looking forward to watching the movie and how it all translated in the visual medium.While the movie itself is too choppy and hasty to get to the next episode I certainly can't blame the makers as it's too much to ask for them to squeeze it in a mere 2 hr 18 mins runtime. The book certainly has a charm that the movie simply is unable to replicate successfully - perhaps it may have been better to make a trilogy or even extend to a part two so as to not miss out on the overall mythology of the books which I found was lost - the film focused on action and doesn't do justice to the book's beautiful exploration of various plots.Over-simplified and frankly too fast-paced (if that's a thing) to really be enjoyable - a disjointed effort that doesn't do justice to the beautiful prose that created it.

Get me a symbologist!,"My God this film is stupid, I mean on the edges of braindead. It is plot holes which you could drive a bus through. Tom Hanks and Ron Howard should really known better to return to this series.The plot of this film goes like this. The Pope has just died and the Catholic Church need to elect a new leader. But here's the problem: a old enemy has emerged, the Illuminati. They have kidnapped the four preferitis (the leading candidates for the papacy) and have stolen a case of anti-matter. They plan to kill a Cardinal every hour till midnight, and bomb the Vactican in an explosion of light. The Catholic Church are determined to continue the election despite threat, and call in help from Havard symbolist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) and CERN scientist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer). They work with the head of the Vatican police led by Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgård), and a liberal priest Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), who wants to open up the church. It becomes a race against time to save the cardinals and prevent Vatican City with thousands of innocent people in St. Peter's Square getting blown up.Angels & Demons is much better then the Da Vinci Code, but having a STD would be better then the Da Vinci Code. Angels & Demons was Dan Brown's first Robert Langdon book, but since the Da Vinci Code was a massive success it became a film first. Therefore Angels & Demons became a sequel to the monster success of the first film. What the main problem with Angels & Demons is the source material. I have read the Da Vinci Code, and I can safety say its one of the worst novels I have ever read. I don't mind the fact the novel was critical of the Catholic Church (normally I enjoy being critical of organised religion), and the book had a good premise, that Jesus had married and had children and his bloodline survives in the modern age. But Dan Brown is a poor writer, there is no characterisation, Robert Langdon is too smart (but only reveals his knowledge at certain points). Brown likes to show how much research he had done given the reader too much information we don't care about, and he still gets the facts wrong. Brown became a writer because he thought he could write a better novel then The Doomsday Conspiracy, and I properly could write better novel then Dan Brown. Whilst the story of the Da Vinci Code might have worked for some people in a book, it definitely didn't work in a film. It was long, drawn out and boring. At least with Angels & Demons the film is shorter, more action packed, and there is more a threat/race against time for the audience to get excited about. But there are still a lot of problems. As mentioned their are plot holes. The biggest being there is a powerful bomb hidden under Rome, and I'm sure the Italian police and military would evaluate the city and use their intelligence services to find the bomb and the Cardinals. The other is why would the Illuminati go through all this effort if they was a trail of evidence behind them. It makes no sense. Why not mix it up a bit. Al-Qaida or the IRA wouldn't operate like that. The twist at the end was also not need and Dan Brown does the same thing in The Da Vinci Code: that trick gets old if not done well. There are also stupid scenes like last action scenes which are so silly. There also the unrealistic element in the film of the police showing up to sense of a dead Cardinal a minute too late. The acts a travelogue for Rome, much like the Da Vinci Code was for Paris and London. I bet Rome's Tourism Board are happy.Acting wise no one stands out for good reason, but that's because of the lack of material to work with. The only I could say who comes out with any merit is Pierfrancesco Favino who plays a senior police officer. Ayelet Zurer disappears off the screen because of the lack of depth she has. And I'm sure everyone knows about Ewan McGregor's poor attempt of an Irish accent: it would have been easier to cast an Irish actor like Michael Fassbender.Ron Howard is a great example of a hit-and-miss director. He can do really good films like Frost/Nixon, Cinderella Man and A Beautiful Mind, but also weak films like the Da Vinci Code, Far and Away and How the Grinch Stole Christmas. He tries his best, but he is not an action director, he is a good drama director. His action scenes were lackluster. As well Howard also doesn't have a lot to work with behind the camera, and struggles to begin real drama or tension to the film.I think the bare bones of the story, an old threat to the church returns could have worked as a really good thriller or horror film, but not as a action film. It could have been handled with a lot more intelligence with better writing, but of course Dan Brown can't write.It's not worth watching.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
A film that would just follow the book would receive a 10,"I've now seen all three movies made by Ron Howard. Each film being worse than the other. They say the book is always better than the movie, however this is only true if you decide that getting to the end of the story is more important than telling the story. Dan Brown books it's not about the ending but more important how it gets to it. His ability to put together a string of facts emotions and movement it's nothing I've ever read. Dan Brown's biggest disappointment in any of his books happens to be the ending. However I think he knows that and that's why I spent so much time putting together a story as intrigue and creates an illusion to make sure you feel your part of the complete story. For example, the movie took the first hundred pages of the book which sets up what the whole story is about and took less than three minutes skipped the whole set up thanking the people already know and it's not important. This is the problem with the movie, It forgets that the reason why the books are so popular is the great detail and characterization in places and emotions. Tom hanks is perfect as the main character, what makes the Book so popular it's where it's located the scenery places with normal people were not able to go that's what this book takes you to. The movie does not take this into consideration and because of that the movies become boring time consuming and a lack of pure adrenaline. I almost wish the Ron Howard show me the movie and I could tell him what's missing. Imagine the movie being a great dish and while the dish looks beautiful you forget a few spices that makes a dish taste fantastic that's what this movie lacks it has the stars it has the location and has the beauty however he misses the spices that will make this movie phenomenal. For example, the first hundred pages of the book is extremely important what causes the whole chain of events is determined in the first hundred pages the movie skips and bypasses other sections of the book just to get the story going however the movie tries to get to the end it forgets in the middle. You can't have a great movie without contacts, you just assume that the person who's watching the movie has read the book and in actuality if you watch this movie it's better if you never read the book otherwise your head the movie just like me. One last thought I've never seen the full movie before I started reading the book decided that I want to watch the movie and I read the first hundred pages of the book. Watch the rest the movie it was a mistake I recommend if you love reading books read the book skip the movie if you don't like reading books and you have no desire with the book was truly about I'm just watching a movieOverall the movies OK has beauty Tom Hanks is good it just like everything else.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery

What a Let Down,"In today's world, we love adventure movies-- especially if they have to do with secret societies, hidden treasures, or myths that deep down, we all want to uncover. A slough of movies have come out recently to please this facet of the public's wants: Indiana Jones, National Treasure, and the duo of the DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons.The craze of the DaVinci Code was well-deserved. The film had everything that adventure-seekers and movie-lovers alike enjoy. The plot was intriguing, involving, deep, well-researched, and, overall, very good. The acting was decent, more than decent for Sir Ian McKellen, but the peak was that most magnificent ending, backed by the beautiful score from Hans Zimmer.Now, Tom Hanks is back-- with new haircut. He has been asked to help the Vatican save the lives of four of their cardinals, as well as the Vatican City as some antimatter (shockingly enough) from the Hadron Collider. The plot is simply odd, not so deep or involving, as it's mainly all centering around the geography of Vatican City, and that's not very interesting. The violence is not the good kind (meaning the kind that makes a movie great) but it makes the film less enjoyable and thoroughly cringe-worthy. Plus, there is no amazing moment of ""Ohhhh..."" for the audience, making it not nearly the smashing, amazing success that the DaVinci Code was.Though Angels & Demons was the prequel to the DaVinci Code, it was not made first. Maybe because everyone knew that the only reason anyone would go see Angels & Demons is because the DaVinci Code makes it seem like it would be great.All in all, not a good call from Ron Howard. Even by Paris Hilton standards, it falls short of gigantic expectations.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Decent...well, not decent, but not bad, although....","This is terribly silly material mounted as though it was a revelation from some high-browed expose of the Catholic Church, I guess. The Church's history is certainly full of colorful, tawdry, lurid stories that really don't need a layer of ""symbolology"" veneered over it. There's very tight, well-directed movie making here, but it's all pretty silly when we're supposed to gasp that a statue's arrow is pointing in some direction to another statue that's pointing in another direction, and there's a big jug of anti-matter (science is poorly used here) boiling somewhere about to go off.Tom Hanks needs to write this one off. I think he's a rare talent, but intellectual posturing isn't encompassed in those talents. The rest of the cast (save Ewan McGregor who can't wait to pull out the stops and chew the marble pillars...he does...have patience, he does) is miles above the material, as is the director and everyone else involved.I won't say this is a good popcorn movie (like ""National Treasure"" or ""The Mummy"" installments which are really its companions) because it has pretensions far above that. Those aren't really made clear, but it's mounted like a million bucks, yet it's only drivel.Ron Brown's books are written like movie scripts. Too bad that Hollywood thought Brown had something serious to say. It's above anything in ""Star Trek""...and in fact there are comparisons. Perhaps Ron Howard should try his turn with the new cast of the Enterprise. That might produce a really fine blockbuster.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

"If you read the book, prepare to be disappointed","Of the people I saw Angels & Demons with, only 2 of us had read the book. And everyone besides the 2 of us liked the movie. I think we would've liked it as well had we not come in with such high expectations from an amazing novel.The problem is how far they stray from the novel for seemingly pointless reasons. The character of Maximillian Kohler (director of CERN and suspect in the bomb threat) is completely absent from the movie. The real villain's reason for the attack has been altered so much that it doesn't even question the same issues of the religion as intended in the story. And what on Earth was the point of changing the final Illuminati symbol?! One of the most fascinating parts of the book was the artistry of these designs, and they left out the most incredible one. There are also dozens more differences that will irritate any fan of the book.If you've read the book, just watch it on DVD if at all. If you haven't read it, go see it and my guess is you'll love it. I'm sure I would have. I think from now on, I'll read the book after the movie to avoid disappointment, because the books always seem to be better.

"Sloppy, Silly, Gory, Ugly, Incomprehensible, Unbelievable, Hateful","""Angels and Demons"" is a sloppy, silly, stupidly gory and violent, badly cast, wrongly conceived, transparent, often incomprehensible, awkwardly plotted, hateful movie that doesn't even offer the fabulous travelogue of Rome's artistic treasures that one had every right to hope for.I went to see ""Angels and Demons"" because I thought it might be fun to see a movie that uses Rome's most fabulous artistic treasures in a gripping, brain-teasing, puzzler of a plot. Ron Howard undermines the movie by filming glorious artworks, Bernini's ""St. Teresa,"" for example, as if they were graffiti-covered sidewalks in a hip hop video. Howard uses hand-held cameras, murky lighting, and jumpy, quick cuts and you never really get to experience St. Peter's Square, the Sistine Chapel, or Rome's fountains, all of which serve as backgrounds for the film.Tom Hanks used to be an actor I respected. Here he is scraping bottom. He looks old, baggy, and lumpy, and he isn't suited to play the intellectual-James-Bond, international sleuth in a fantasy thriller.The plot is a mishmash of the incomprehensible and the impossible. There are several unnecessary, gory, sadistic scenes I wish I had never seen. The villain will be obvious to anyone who's ever seen a movie and has a three digit IQ. The movie might have been fun camp; Howard makes the mistake of treating it seriously.It's no good for Howard, Hanks, and Dan Brown to protest that they don't hate Catholicism, for ""Angels and Demons"" is a profoundly hateful film that lies deeply and repeatedly in its depiction of Catholics and Catholicism as a cabal of malevolent conspirators. It's frequently pointed out and absolutely true that no contemporary, mainstream Hollywood film would ever depict members of faiths other than Christianity in such an ugly, bigoted way.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Idiotic. Best left in the arrivals lounge rubbish bin.,"And I say that with disbelief fully suspended.This is what happens when you try to convert a reasonable page-turner into something without pages: over two hours' worth of escape room antics, laced with conspiracy theory, characters that are as unlikely as they are uninteresting, and dodgy science, the whole of it cobbled together in Europe and surrounded with plenty of non-English dialogue, to lend it an air of what some audiences presumably think passes for old world culture and sophistication.There's a reason why Dan Brown's stuff is often classified as ""airport fiction"": you pick it up somewhere before departure, flick through it while waiting and in-flight, finish off around arrivals, and then throw it in the trash. This film is a pleasantly faithful adaptation of that concept.Tom Hanks plays a shouty American academic-turned-sleuth (basically a flabbier Indiana Jones with more belly and less khaki), his cardboard cut-out, vaguely Southern European sidekick trails in his wake, echoing his leaps of intuition (when she isn't staring at some undisclosed point off-screen), mostly woodenly but sometimes in a foreign language, because that's more authentic than a shouty American, and the rest of the reasonably good cast spend most of the time gurning.The only halfway interesting performance is from Nikolaj Lie Kaas, which is why I'm giving this 3 stars, instead of the minimum of 1 star necessary to be able to leave a review.",3.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Enjoyed the book more,"I read the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons - then watched both the movie over a period of time. I think in both cases the movies really lacked substance - and coming from a lightweight like me that is saying something I can tell you.This movie had much, much less content than the book of course and I agree with some of the other reviews - key elements were left out.In the end the movie has some good periods of excitement but it really dips too much in between.I love Rome, I loved the book but I will not be watching this movie again.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
disappointing,"I have been reading Dan brown novels ever since they first came in the market they all represent perhaps in a fictitious story an idea which may not be so untrue his books are real wealth of knowledge and i can't even imagine how much research he must have put it to actually write that kind of stuff. Angels and demons by Dan brown gave a lot of it's volume to explain the scientific stuffs like anti-matter and many things see the basic idea of novel is to actually bring to surface the centuries old war of science and religion. Told in a way well only way i can describe it is like attending a Howard lecture on a roller coaster ride. To be honest this movie is really well made if you are looking for good direction , great acting of course by tom hanks, great special effects especially the one where bomb goes off. But for me as a read of the novel i came in expecting the movie to have a strong message which will force us to think about stuffs. That certainly did not happen with the disastrous plot they had in order to make the movie small and you know one of those action thrillers they make these days they just killed the whole soul of the novel The most disastrous of all was the character of camerlengo his portrayal in the movie was like a hungry for power hound as compared to a very complex one shown in the novel of being a mis directed but good at heart kinda guy. Anyways for me the movie was one of the biggest disappointment being a reader of the novel more so because it was of tom hanks. but i guess if you haven't read the novel you shouldn't really care much about those things just put it in the category of indiana jones and you will enjoy it.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery

Spectacular but somehow empty,"I'm not the biggest fan of the film adaptation of Da Vinci Code, yet I'm surprised to see Angels & Demons actually receives somewhat higher marks. I felt that the film was trying to achieve too much. Granted, many of the images are grandiose, spectacular, bombastic, and Tom Hanks sure looks good in black. Yet it was all somehow so lifeless, just like the Swiss Guard. I did enjoy Armin Mueller-Stahl's steel blue twinkle, but it was almost identical to his twinkle in Eastern Promises. In the end, it all felt too pompous and contrived. The master symbolist solving riddles that finger-point right across Rome, hints that no other than him can discern. In between some scenes of excessive brutality, twitching bodies burning to death. And in the end, an unlikely master plotter - of course.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
"Passionate, Fiery, Puzzling... But Also Deeply Flawed","Tom Hanks returns as Robert Langdon, dedicated cryptologist and all-around smartest guy in the room, just in time to save Catholicism from conspiracy and MacGuffin alike. The film moves at a rapid pace, and excels at white-knuckled, buzzer-beating thrills, but it's got problems. Not the least of which is Langdon himself, who spouts like a broken nozzle atop the fountain of knowledge for the duration. OK, we get it, he's exceptionally smart and this is what he does best, but his act quickly grows redundant and tiresome. Not only does he know all the answers almost as soon as the riddle presents itself, robbing the audience of the joy of working anything out for themselves, he's also immediately ready to fire off a lengthy dissertation about the relevant historical figures, masterpieces and religious movements while muscling about various set pieces. That evil becomes necessary when the film quickly paints itself into a corner, setting a merciless time limit on each puzzle that pushes suspension of disbelief right out the window. Now, not only are we unraveling mysteries older than recorded time in less than sixty minutes, but we're also visiting libraries, slicing through political red tape and effortlessly navigating the whole of Vatican City, swamped by humanity in the midst of a papal election. Despite all that, I still held the film in good graces until the calamitous final act, which is capped by exploding helicopters, ludicrous swerves and a parachutin' pilot priest. More generic than The Da Vinci Code, it places a much heavier emphasis on nail-biting than convention-challenging, which is a shame because that's precisely the trait that set the original apart. Not quite disastrous, but dangerously close.",4.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Well... So much for Angels And Demons,"To start off with... I haven't read The Da Vinci Code nor Angels And Demons. This review is only made from watching the films. I'm what you might call: Not a reader. I prefer the visuals instead.I remember when I first watched TDVC it was kind of long and boresome. After I got it on DVD and watched it a couple more times, it hooked me. Especially the scene with Hanks and McKellen discussing, over a cup of tea, how the gospels came to life. I very much like their argumentations for and against their validity into the Bible.Sadly we don't see any kind of this in AAD. The movie is driven by the action quite a bit, and do not dwell at any time in longer discussions or something close to that.TDVC have been watched a great many times, where as AAD will more be like a part of the DVD-collection. To be dusted off and watched occasionally Don't get me wrong though. The scale of the movie is grand. But it feels more like a tourist-attraction to come see the Vatican and Italy's churches rather than to tell a good story.McGregor is almost always awesome in whatever role he plays. But he alone can't carry the weight of this much anticipated movie on his shoulders.I do have to comment that 2 distinguished gentlemen from Denmark played a role in this movie too. Kaas as the assassin and Lindhardt as the Vatican police officer/keeper of the Vatican library (Note his awkward interpretation of the English language even though he's portrayed as a German, or something like that). Sorry... But he don't quite pull this off, though a great danish actor. Kaas on the other hand I liked very much in his role. If You haven't figured it out yet... Yeah I'm a dane too. lolI like action very much. But to me, it's kind of misplaced here to a certain degree. When You know the story of TDVC and how it plays out, then AAD disappoints me because we don't dwell too much on any given thing in this movie.A good work-out action-piece is my vote on this one. Would at any given time prefer to watch TDVC.",5.0,Anonymous,Mystery
Tom Hanks vs. The Illuminati,"It's easy to go into this film pondering its very existence. It's not like The Da Vinci Code was particularly well-received by the general public so, to follow that up with another Dan Brown adaptation feels a little out of place. Especially when you've got the same director (Ron Howard) behind the project.
This film isn't terrible. It's something fans of The Da Vinci Code will enjoy it just fine, but for those of us who either didn't like it or were on the fence about it (me), it's really just more of the same.
The acting is fine and the overall plot is actually a little bit more exciting and better in its execution than The Da Vinci Code, but it's still filled with way more filler than it needs, panning the runtime once again and dragging the overall pace of the film down.
As was the case with its predecessor, it feels like it suffers by trying too hard to please the fans of the novel, cramming in a large handful of plot points and details that work just fine on paper but don't translate well to the screen.
Overall., Angels & Demons is on the same level as The Da Vinci Code, if not a little bit better, but it still doesn't have enough to make it memorable or particularly rewatchable. I enjoyed it for what it was, but I was also glad to be free of it in the end.

Well Produced But Lame Story,"Remember that old King Kong movie where Perry Mason shows up to instruct the Japanese how to fight Godzilla... like Perry Mason is an expert at fighting prehistoric lizards?

They live and breath the stuff, but they need Mr Atheist to say ""Oh, here's the clue right in front of us."" Oh, and the stereotypcial highly intelligent gorgeous sidekick in high heels, lots of cliches, goodguys, badguys, a plot twist, upon which are wasted excellent production values.Pretty much zero suspense. Kirk and five redshirts beam down, despite the onslaught we all know that Kirk will be fine. There was zero empathy going on in this movie.

"Ultra-closeups, special effects, editing: not much fun anymore","Greetings -- Good expectation for a good bit of entertainment and perhaps even some edification. But... Just another darn night at the mega-theater, putting up with utterly atrocious previews of coming attractions. Both the previews and what they preview.
