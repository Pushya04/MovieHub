Thank's a bunch for this one,"Fargo is a great piece of movie. It has a strong story and a strong cast. It's down to earth and believable.Jerry Lundegaard is in some trouble. He hires two small time crocks from Fargo to kidnap his wife. The plan is for her father to pay off and for Jerry to take the money. Things don't exactly goes as planned as they kill three people and get a pregnant Chief on their tail.The Coen brothers have does a terrific job on this movie. It's a well written, original story with an original setting and it doesn't try to be anything it isn't. Just a few characters, a simple plot and small scale. They stay away of clichés and don't even remotely try to mix in anything of that regular Hollywood crap. They manage to capture the mood, the people and the action pretty good. The characters are great, they're reasonable and believable. They manage to keep it serious, but not too serious and put inn a joke here and there.The actors are great. They way they manage to put on a happy smile and make it seem polite and a little, but not all too false in a great way. William H. Macy is great as Jerry Lundegaard. He gives a little nervous, kind of boy scout performance and it fits perfect. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare makes two great small time losers. Buscemi is great as a small, funny looking, constant talking bad guy and Stormare fits the big silent, violent, psychopath type really good and they act these characters all the way out. Kristin Rudrüd does a good job as Jean Lundegaard and Harve Presnell as the rich dad is always a winner.The cinematography is good. All of the shots are good looking and some of them are original, cool and extra good looking. All of the shots are well composed, the lightning is good, but not much out of the ordinary. There are a nice play with the colors in some shots involving the snow.The score is really nice. The theme is a little sad and so is the movie. It's moody and supports the action and fits the settings very well. It's used in a classical way between the action and that works very well, it makes the action seem more real and more close.Fargo is a original movie out of the ordinary. The story is good, well written and it's well brought to life and captured. The Coen brothers has made a timeless and very enjoyable movie. See it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Cold-hearted,"The Coen brothers' 'Fargo' is nearly a great film: a beautifully shot, blackly comic thriller that quietly subverts every convention of the genre. This is a film where the remote mid-western city of Minneapolis plays the same role as New York in a normal crime story, a hub of civilisation and vice; where the hero is a woman (and a heavily pregnant, happily married woman at that); and the chief villain a car salesman of absolutely no slickness whatsoever. In a final irony, most of the action doesn't even take place in Fargo, but in the even more obscure town of Brainerd. Yet I found it hard to love this film. At brief moments (in depicting the relationship of policewoman Marge, played superbly by Frances McDormaid, and her husband), it feels astonishingly tender, yet at others, it feels as if it is simply making fun of the strange folks from outer America with the wacky accents and absurdly stoical demeanour. And the combination of deadpan acting and frankly silly plot excess sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. Above all else, perhaps, 'Fargo' lacks a beating heart: while nearly moving, and nearly funny, there's a part of this film that refuses to commit itself, that prefers to hold back and mock not just its subjects, but also the idea that a film should take itself seriously. The Coens are widely celebrated as among the best film-makers of our age, but watching their films, I usually end up wondering whether irony is not a slightly over-rated virtue. Fargo looks lovely, and weird, and has a wry outlook all of it's own; but it won't make you laugh out loud, or cry. If it wasn't called a masterpiece I might almost like it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You're darned tootin'!,"""What'd this guy look like anyway?""  ""Oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny lookin'.""  ""Uh-huh. In what way?""  ""Just a general way.""  In that interplay between a Brainerd, MN., police officer and a witness  discussing a criminal investigation, you have one of your principal  pieces of dialogue from what is considered by many to be Joel and Ethan  Coen's finest film.  Of course you can draw comparisons to others they've made, such as  Blood Simple, Raising Arizona, even Barton Fink and The Big Lebowski.  But Fargo illustrates the Coen Brothers' takes on plot, art and drama  more succinctly and emotionally than any of those others. Here you have  a set of memorable, if not always likable, characters in a plot that  goes from clunky to chaotic in the most unspoiled manner, from Jerry  Lundegaard's stilted conversation with Gaear and Carl in a bar in Fargo  at the beginning of the movie - the only occasion in which the movie  specifically shows you Fargo, N.D. - to Marge Gunderson's confrontation  with Gaear and the wood-chipper.  Frances McDormand deservedly won an Oscar for playing a well-balanced,  intelligent, pregnant police officer placing her own straightforward  methodology on to an investigation of bizarre goings-on. And William H.  Macy gives a true one-two punch playing a frenetically-charged, fearful  and, in the end, inept used car salesman trying in the most remarkable  manner to make money. The two best scenes in the movie are the two  occasions in which Marge questions Jerry about the Brainerd murders and  a car from his lot being involved -- I couldn't imagine an actress  doing a better job of seriously but comically exclaiming, ""He's fleeing  the interview!""  Notable among the actors as well are Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare  playing Carl and Gaear, the two hit men hired by Jerry to help him con  his father-in-law out of money. There's comic brilliance watching  Stormare silently grimace at Buscemi's violent but gregarious behavior,  and Buscemi shines being able to play the most out-of-control of all  the characters in the movie. Kristin Rudrüd also stands out playing  Jean Lundegaard, Jerry's haplessly kidnapped wife.  If you can appreciate an intelligent look at not-always-so-intelligent  life on this planet, you'll enjoy the little more than the hour and a  half this movie has to show you.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Best Effort From A Number Of  People,"I didn't see this in the theater but saw it the first week it was out for rental, and have enjoyed it ever since. In fact, I probably enjoy this more each time I view it. It's a sick movie, though, make no mistake about that. However, it holds a strange fascination, probably because of the odd characters.About the story: first, it is NOT a true story as indicated in the movie. That's a lie. It's a fictional kidnapping-turned into murder story with a few bloody scenes, lots of profanity (most of it by Steve Buscemi) and a comedy. Yup, this is pure ""black comedy."" It's dark humor mixed in with a parody about the way the Scandanavian people in the upper Midwest supposedly speak.Both William H. Macy and Frances McDormand have some wonderful facial expressions along with their accents. Those two and Buscemi are the lead characters and all three ""are a trip."" Macy is hilarious; the best character in here, in my opinion. The more I watch this film, the funnier he gets. It's also the best role, I assume, ever for McDormand who was never a star before - or since - this movie. Her character in here, ""Marge Gunderson,"" elevates this movie from just another modern-day sick crime movie, to an original. It's nice to see a wonderful husband-wife relationship, too, as is shown here with her and husband ""Norm"" (John Lynch).You have this clean, old-fashioned lady cop (McDormand), a middle-of-the-road bungling car salesman (Macy) and two extreme low-life killers in ""Carl Showalter"" (Buscemi) and ""Gaear Grimsrud"" (Peter Stormare) all combining to make this story a mixture not only of people but genres. Other minor characters are strange, too, led by one of Marge's old high school acquaintances ""Mike Yanagita"" (Steve Park). Add to that some equally-bizarre music (slow violins) and you have this unusual story that brings out the morbid fascination in us viewers.So, I guess what I am saying is this movie truly is an original, the best film the Coen Brothers have ever made and maybe the rest roles ever for the three main actors, McDormand, Macy and Buscemi.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece of Shakesperean proportions,"I've always thought Fargo would make a great Shakesperean play; you could alter the modern elements and still have created a buzz 400 years ago in suburban England. Indeed, the plot is similar to Hamlet's, in that they both have characters we root for who create zany plans than end up spinning wildly out of control into bloodshed. Many people seem to like Fargo for its humorous qualities, its characterization of the Minnesotan culture and Frances McDormand- not me. I love Fargo for its brilliant writing, its tragic musical score, its tragic plot, William H Macy, Harve Presnell and Steve Buscemi, its ignorance of political correctness (how many movies can you remember when the only two minority characters were both revealed to be creeps).I want to draw attention to an overlooked reason why the film works so well - how well the music suits the visuals in this movie. Each murder scene is scored superbly, and other audio clues really add to the effect (for instance, notice how when the police officer asks Carl Showalter ""What's this?"" in reference to the abductee, a disquieting guitar sound is immediately played that has an instantaneous psychological effect on how you interpret the scene). I have seen this film over, well, an embarrassing number of times and have committed its screenplay, from start to finish, by memory. Fargo is the ultimate Coen Brothers movie, a brilliant tragedy, and restores my faith in Roger Ebert as he places this movie in as his fourth favorite movie of the '90s.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It's such an entertaining film.,"Jerry Lundegaard is sick of working for his father in law, sick of his wife, and decides it's time to get rid of his challenging relatives, he employs hitmen, but things don't go according to plan.Fargo is one of those films that didn't finish with time, arguably it gets better with subsequent viewings. Yes it's a thriller, but it's way too comical to be a straight up action thriller, the humour is prevelant throughout, it's a black comedy, and for my money, it's one of the best of them, some of the situations are outrageous.It's almost a little surreal at times, let's be clear, this is not based on any real life events, what it is however is thoroughly entertaining. It will make you want to watch the TV series.I will never tire of hearing the word 'Marge,' and if you're watching for the first time, you'll hear it a lot, you'll also hear some curious accents.Very well acted, William H.

Fargo - Review,"I didn't really think, about what to expect from this movie, but ehm - it was good, but I don't understand the cult status here. Absolutely not. It has some interesting ideas and some bizarre moments and it's fun and all, but not a single twist or some kind of thick character development - I don't know, wasn't bored, but it is just a mediocre crime thriller with some nice moments here and there, but certainly nothing more. Francia McDormand was very good, and so was Macy and Buscemi and that blonde guy, but I don't really know what to love. I appreciate it, of course I do, it's not a trash movie and the cinematography isn't bad (omg it's Deakins), but 4.2 on Letterboxd? That's quite a lot for this movie. But finally watched it, because I remember I started a watch long ago but didn't watch it so yeah, glad I finally did and - it wasn't excellent. Just a fun little crime movie, nothing more I'm afraid.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
WTF?!,"This movie ranks in the IMDb top 250 and has won two Oscars out of seven nominations, not to mention its cult status. If I didn't know all this, it would have left me without a special impression. But this way, it left me completely shocked. I honestly wonder who's crazy here. ""Fargo"" won an Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen. Okay, on paper this story really has great potential. I can also understand William H. Macy's nomination somewhat. But nominations for Best Picture and directing?! Really, WTF?! All the characters in the film, except the cold-blooded sociopath, are portrayed as slightly falling behind in their mental development. Both their actions and how they are portrayed by the cast cause chronic embarrassment transfers throughout the film. Something like that would work in some types of comedy, but with such characters and acting, to call this movie a drama or a thriller ... WTF ?! Directing also has nothing to do with these genres. Drama and tension do not occur even in trace amounts. The story may be a true event, and in reality it was probably a drama and a thriller, but the way it is presented in this movie is totally frivolous. It had the potential for upsetting drama, for a suspenseful thriller, and even for a morbid comedy, but this mix of the Coen brothers looks like a clumsy result of their hesitation to opt for the genre. Watchable, but probably the most overrated movie I saw in years.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coen Brothers come up with another winner.,"With no major stars or well-known names, the actors outshine many more familiar personages.  The story is well thought out.  The criminals don't try to ingratiate themselves with the audience which adds to its reality.  The acting is most convincing and the writing is excellent.  Even the cold of a North Dakota winter comes across.

"Okay, but what was the fuss all about? Accents??","I saw this film in 2004, long after the Oscar buzz had died down. I suppose it's a victim of its own hype. I enjoyed the film, but it seemed somehow smaller than I expected. Frances McDormand's Oscar-winning performance seems so trivial, seen through the perspective of eight years. The story is okay, though I again wonder about the Oscar the Coens received. (The 1996 Oscars were a somewhat weak field.) I spent most of the movie wondering if people in Minnesota and the Dakotas really talk that way, or is ""Fargo"" as much a travesty of regional accents as most ""southern"" movies are? Overall, the whole film was a nicely filmed, tight little story with apparently overdone regional ironies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
YEP!  I AM THE ONE GUY WHO DIDN'T LIKE FARGO!,"Okay, I know I have just made more enemies than I can count.  But, I ask, what is so funny about Fargo?  Really, I never laughed through the whole movie, ever.  I have a really twisted sense of humor, but anything can make me laugh.  I loved O' Brother Where Art Thou.  I loved Happy Gilmore.  I loved Clerks.  I loved Dr. Strangelove.  I loved Blazing Saddles.  So there, I love a very diverse amount of comedies.  But I did not love Fargo.First off, the accents.  People say that these Wisconsin accents are hilarious.  Well, they're not.  I grew up in the South, okay.  I have never met a person with a Wisconsin accent in my life.  But I do see them in movies and on TV a lot.  These are just normal accents.  There is nothing satirical about them.  They aren't that funny.  Get over it.Okay, the plot.  Is it just me or is the plot to this movie mediocre and boring?  It's an average crime movie.  I know crime movies.  That's my forte, you could say.  My favorite movie genre is crime (Pulp fiction, Leon, Reservoir Dogs, The Usual Suspects, Heat, etc...).  But this movie is just an average movie.  The plot is pretty predictable too.  I could have guessed the entire movie from the word go.Now, I will give credit where credit is due.  The movie isn't all bad.  The acting is good.  The dialog is quick and edgy.  The writing is intelligent. And the direction is sharp and nice.  But there is nothing funny, groundbreaking, or remotely interesting about this movie.Okay, one last gripe.  If you haven't seen the movie, avert thy eyes, because the ending is about to be told.  Okay, you still here?  Good, I warned you.The wood chipper scene is one of the most famous scenes in the history of movies, or so it has become.  Honestly, I see nothing funny about it.  It's not that I'm against throwing people into wood chippers.  I liked Evil Dead 2.  Gore doesn't bother me.  But what is so damn funny about throwing a human corpse into a wood chipper?  It makes sense to me.  If you wanted to dispose of a body and a wood chipper is near by, well hey! IDEA!  THROW IT IN!  But is it funny?  Not really.  Is it gory? No.  Is it bad?  No.  But is it deserving of being called one of the greatest scenes ever?  HELL NO!I am really trying to understand people's love of this movie.  I wasn't the biggest fan of The Blues Brothers, but I understand why people love it. Fargo isn't funny, nor is it very interesting.  The acting is the only thing that kept me interested.  I love W.H. Macy.  All the actors and actresses are good in this movie.  But is this movie the work of genus that people make it out to be?  No, ohhhhhhhhhh God no.In conclusion: This movie is an ""okay"" movie.  There's nothing bad about it, but it isn't great.  I hate it when people make movies out to be better than they really are.  I found The Untouchables, The Blues Brothers, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Being John Malkovic, and Fargo to all be overrated movies.  They're not bad, they're just not great, or even that good either. (ESPECIALLY CROUCHING TIGER!)  People, please join me in the crusade to bring the truth out and bring down the overrated movies!My rating: 5/10PS:  Go ahead, send the hate mail.  I welcome it.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of Those Rare Gems in the Cinema,"With all the sorry films these days it is good to see a movie as funny, wicked, dramatic, and utterly demented as ""Fargo"".  It's one of those films that you just have to see.  William H. Macy gives an Oscar-nominated performance as a car salesman who hires two thugs (one a know-it-all-know-nothing and the other a demented psychopath) to kidnap his wife so that he can keep half the ransom from her well-off father. Needless to say nothing goes right and Brainerd sheriff Frances McDormand (in an Oscar-winning role) comes in to save the day.  I won't give anything away because the material is too good to tell those who haven't seen this inventive film.  ""Fargo"" was ranked on the 100 Greatest Films list in 1996 and it was well-deserved.  In this age of by-the-numbers film making, this film was a refreshing flashback to the risk-taking style that made the 1970s such a great decade for movies.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
What a flick!,"If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favour and see it. It is very well put together and the plot is constantly evolving into a deeper shade of creepiness. At times scary (not in the horror movie sense) and quite rich in dark humour, this is one of those movies that gives you a weird felling inside even an hour after its over. The music is quite appropriate and unlike Scarface, is timeless. The camera work is usually quite basic but whoever directed the photography had the enjoyable habit of giving us interestingly artistic segways between scenes. This is the first film so far that I've given a 10 out of 10. I was going to give it a 9, but I couldn't think of a reason to take any points from perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My favourite Coen brothers movie,"The Coen brothers can always be guaranteed to deliver a quirky, diverting, off-key movie experience, and FARGO remains their most successful movie to date; a story of small-town life, dead cold temperatures, and a bloody crime wave. As with the majority – if not all – of their films, it's a densely-plotted, intelligently-scripted story, with a cold grasp on reality throughout but nevertheless some absurd situations to enjoy.Things begin small and gradually build up to a blood-spattered climax, propelled by tons of originality and irregularity which propels this past most similar genre fare. Frances McDormand deservedly got an Oscar for her excellent performance as the pregnant cop, but William H. Macy is equally good as the nervous car salesman whose life spirals out of control. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are also brilliant as the two psychotic criminals who begin by kidnapping and end in  well I'll leave it for you to find out. In parts touching, warm, funny, frightening and shocking, FARGO is an example of the crime thriller at its best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You have no call to get snippy with me.,"I just love McDormand's face when she says that line - she takes a beat, her facial expression doesn't change, and then it comes out of her mouth like she's ordering a hamburger. Brilliant.This is one of my all time favorite movies. I saw it the first day it opened in New York City, and I loved it. I've seen it again since.What strikes me during repeated viewings is the spareness of it. Fargo moves very quickly and there isn't anything peripheral in it, no fillers. It's just a great movie and a great story with great characterizations. Wow, when I put it that way, it sounds like anyone could do it. Would that were true.There's no point in going through the story. I'll just write that Frances McDormand is sensational, as is everyone in the film - she and William H. Macy are standouts. You can really feel his desperation.There are so many great scenes - when Marge thinks she's going to barf, the scene with Macy referenced above, her little lecture to the criminals, the stamp discussion. And who can forget her old friend from high school? That scene is priceless! I also love the endless expanse of snow when the search for the money begins.This film was a real high point for me. It is a true masterpiece done by two of our most imaginative filmmakers and starring one of our finest actresses.

Paul Bunyan territory,"Joel Coen the director of ""Fargo"", proves he is one of our best directors with this tale of deception and murder told in a style that takes humorous turns in the action. ""Fargo"" is one of the best American films of the nineties. Joel Coen working together with his brother, Ethan, have made pictures that will be viewed as classics, as time will tell. Their movies are always an excellent way to spend some time because they always manage to deliver, even in films that aren't popular with the public.A lot of what makes this film work is the amazing casting feat the Coen brothers achieved in giving Frances McDormand and William H. Macy, two of our best film actors, prominent presence in it. The Marge Gunderson of Ms. McDormand is one of the best creations the Coen brothers have produced. The same can be said of William H. Macy's take on the pathetic Jerry Lundergaard, the idiotic man who sets things in motion in the film. Ms. McDormand and Mr. Macy have only one scene together, yet one wouldn't even think about other actors playing these roles.The supporting cast of ""Fargo"" is a joy to watch. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare make two of the most enjoyable bad guys in memory. These two scum bags are a joke. Anyone in his right mind wouldn't entrust either Carl or Gaer for a hit job. John Carroll Lynch plays Norm, the stoic man who is married to Marge. Harve Presnell is good as Wade Gustafson.The atmosphere created by the Coens work well. We are constantly reminded of the deep winter seasons of the area where the action takes place. They have given their characters a local flavor and even to hear them talk would take us to that region of the country.""Fargo"" is a joy to watch thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Nobody seems to know that Fargo is,"Nobody seems to know that Fargo is first and foremost a beautiful and very simple love story about two ordinary rural small town American people and secondly a superbly acted crime murder mayhem movie, probably the best that has ever been filmed. Every character is genuine, believable, and Home, not Hollywood, spun. The suspense rolls in and out like a San Francisco fog. The side shows that are built in are amazing (sheriff's conversation at a bar with old acquaintance - stamp conversations - breakfast makings). The whole film is an American Shakesphere. I actually know frequent moviegoers who have not seen Fargo (and Sling Blade and Shine). I feel a special sorrow for them. Back to Fargo, every time I watch it I don't want it to ever end. I even sometimes find myself wishfully thinking I could move up there, it's a Lake Wobegone, and then the movie would never end.

BANALITY OF EVIL VS. BANALITY OF GOOD,"The eternal conflict between good and evil is played out here against the backdrop of a bitter cold American landscape. A group of quirky, ruthless criminals eventually find themselves pursued by a very pregnant cop and her unassuming colleagues.

This is the movie that should have won the Oscar in '97 but lost to The English Patient which had lots of snob appeal, the one thing Fargo lacked - for sure. It would take years for the Academy to make up for their error by awarding the statuette to the Coen's No Country For Old Men, one of the rare times when the best picture winner actually WAS the year's best picture. Fargo May have lost that year, but one thing it did win was the gratitude of many film-goers for the gift of a wonderfully entertaining crime movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Excellent acting, but smugness hangs over the whole thing like a frosty pall","Minnesota car-dealer arranges to have his wife kidnapped in order to get his hands on his father-in-law's money, but the plan goes awry. Another blood-soaked black comedy from the Coen Brothers (Joel directed, and he and Ethan wrote the screenplay from a ""true story"", which won them Oscars). Frances McDormand, William H. Macy (in a star-making performance) and nearly everyone else in the cast give funny, credible and memorable performances, but the film itself is wobbly (purposefully, yet often irritatingly so), padded, and at times brutal--but nearly always undermined by a quasi-comedic tone which is both tiresome and tasteless. Despite strong scenes, it is over-scaled and cut very broadly, and cannot escape the Coens' penchant for self-reverence. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Just plain brilliant,This is a slow burn and raw film about some odd folk in the a state that has few people and a ton of snow and cold in the winter.The cast is nothing short of perfect.

Fargo,"Ya know this is actually quite a hard film to evaluate. It left me feeling unsatisfied and gross. This story is so disastrous and disturbing I cannot believe it's true. This being said this film has a lot going for it, it has a wicked funny sense of dark humor. Although with each scene disaster seems to continually unfurl, it's written so well that each tragedy comes off as amusing. It is a bit reminiscent of pulp fiction. I enjoyed the vibe and humor of this film, it's down my alley. But again, something about it was incredibly unsatisfying and gross. As a story like this should.I mean Steve buscemi really does look like a weirdo though.-since writing this review I have since come to find out that this is not entirely a true story oops-",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I'd score this a 10/10 and is an American film masterpiece.,"Fargo (1996) is a movie I recently watched again on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a group of kidnappers executing a paid job for a scammer of sorts. As some eccentrically behaved local detectives start investigating a recent murder conducted by the previously referenced kidnappers, the entire kidnapping may get blown up. This move is directed by the amazing Coen Brothers (Raising Arizona) and stars William H. Macy (Shameless), Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs), Kristin Rudrüd (Drop Dead Gorgeous), Frances McDormand (Nomadland) and John Carroll Lynch (Zodiac). The storyline for this is so interesting and contains intricate characters, sub plots and primary plot. There's so much depth in every aspect of this movie you get fascinated by every facet, and both the good and bad guys. Loved how the entire story unfolds and every aspect of this movie is satisfying. I'd score this a 10/10 and is an American all time masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Could have been good, but just plain annoying.","I can only classify this film as a missed opportunity. While it did have a good storyline, worthy of a film noir, and some very good performances, especially by William H. Macy (you can almost see him crumbling under the weight of not just his crimes, but his cover-ups as well), it is tainted by the Coen brothers' directorial style.  What made it intolerable for me was the amount of ""quirkiness"" that was injected into every single character, scene, and situation. Taken alone, each little quirk is not a big deal, but after so many of them, one after another, it just gets too much to stomach.Some examples...The title: The movie takes place mostly in Minneapolis (which isn't quirky enough -- that's where the Mary Tyler Moore Show took place, after all), and Brainerd (and nobody would go see a movie called ""Brainerd""). About 5 minutes of screen time were set in Fargo, and Fargo has a quirky-enough sound.""True"" story: Just because a story is true, does that make it a better story? There is both good and bad fiction and non-fiction. So, what is gained by lying about whether a story is true or not? Quirkiness! See, if you believe this story is true, then all this quirkiness must be true too!Names: Character names were given as Grimsrud, Lundegaard, Showalter and Gunderson. Apparently, Scandinavian-sounding names (especially with a double-a) are much quirkier than Pryce, Lopez, Rossi and Sheppard.The weather: The snow and the cold serve no purpose but to make the characters put on parkas and snow boots, which make them look quirky. For instance, when the policeman was talking with the man shoveling his driveway, and had to put his hood up so far you couldn't see his face. Quirky! However, anyone who lives in a cold climate knows that when the sky is that grey and the snow is as wet as the stuff he was shoveling, it isn't all that cold...Accents: Whether or not people actually talk ""like that"", what's the point of everyone talking like some country bumpkin, even the ones in the fairly large city of Minneapolis? Accents: quirky. No accents: not quirky.Pregnancy: Apart from making the lead character wobble when she walked, and to give her a convenient excuse to throw up every once in a while, what exactly was the point of making the police chief pregnant? Ah yes, another quirk.The old friend: A cop meeting an old high school flame at a bar. Sounds kinda dull, right? Well, let's quirk it up a bit. Make the cop a woman -- no, wait: a pregnant woman. Make the guy Oriental. Make it totally unnecessary to the plot. Now we're talkin' quirky!By the time we get to the end, we're almost surprised that Macy's character sold plain old GM cars instead of Austin Minis or VW Beetles. The whole thing feels like the directors had no confidence in the subject matter, so they slathered on layer after layer of quirks in the hope the audience wouldn't notice.In the end, it just becomes an exercise in frustration, as a movie that had everything going for it just turns you off after one wink and a poke in the ribs too many.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Villains Make This Movie,"Frances McDormand won the Oscar for her lead performance and William H. Macy is perfect in his role as the bumbling protagonist. However, it is the two villains, played brilliantly by Steve Buscemi and Peter Storemare, who define this black comedy from the Coen brothers. Storemare is especially gruesome as the stone cold killer who can stare a hole through you. The only flaw of this movie is a side story about a former high school friend of McDormand's who weakly tries to romance her during her murder investigation. This part of the script could be removed and the movie would actually improve.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Frances & The Coens at Their Oscar-Winning Finest!,"Even people I know who can't stand the Coen Brothers' style *love* this slyly low-key comedy-thriller. Unlike so many ""offbeat"" movies, the quirkiness of FARGO's Oscar-winning screenplay never cancels out its warmth or suspense as the Coens deftly balance clever plotting (*not* really based on a true story, as a poor disturbed Japanese woman found out when she came to the U.S. to dig up the hidden ransom money only to freeze to death trying), engaging characters, scares, poignancy, and the brothers' trademark loopy humor. Darkly hilarious as the kidnappers' bungling is, it renders the violence all the more chilling; one minute you're laughing, the next minute you're cringing over the shock of sympathetic characters meeting swift, bloody deaths. I found myself feeling terribly sorry for poor, sweet, unsuspecting Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud), her vulnerable adolescent son Scotty (Tony Denman), her wealthy father Wade (a delightfully bombastic Harve Presnell), and the other poor slobs unwittingly caught up in car salesman Jerry Lundegaard's plot to get money out of Wade by hiring two thugs to kidnap wife Jean and hold her for ransom, not factoring in the kidnappers' lack of both patience and anger management skills. Nobody plays losers like William H. Macy, and he sure deserved his Best Supporting Actor nomination for playing Jerry, who ought to have his picture in the dictionary next to the word ""inept."" Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are letter-perfect as the loose-cannon wife-snatchers; if Buscemi isn't our generation's Peter Lorre, I don't know who is. But the heart and soul of FARGO is Frances McDormand, who truly earned her Best Actress Oscar here. Looking a bit like a young brunette Carol Burnett, McDormand is beyond superb as Marge Gunderson, the pregnant sheriff (my husband always liked the fact that FARGO doesn't include the nigh-obligatory scene of The Pregnant Heroine Suddenly Going Into Labor At The Worst Possible Time) who runs circles around the bad guys *and* her own well-meaning police force. Courteous and smart, down-to-earth yet slick, her luminous blue-green eyes never missing a thing, McDormand's Marge comes off as a warm Minnesota (is that an oxymoron? :-) female hybrid of Joe Friday and Lt. Columbo (I mean Columbo's stealth smarts, not his sloppiness :-). If you love FARGO, you owe it to yourself to own the deluxe DVD, chock full of way-cool extras too nifty and numerous to go into here -- oh, yah! :-)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Films like ""Fargo"" are why I love the movies, said Roger Ebert.","""Films like ""Fargo"" are why I love the movies"", said Roger Ebert. The film-makers Joel and Ethan Coen, the writing/directing team also known as Two Headed Director, are the reason why I believe in the modern movie-making. To take the story like the one Fargo is based on which has been told so many times before and, I am sure, will be told over and over again, to turn and twist it in the most in-anticipated ways, to create the characters so alive and three dimensional that you believe every word they say and every step they take, to provide them with some of the best quotes and dialogs I've ever had pleasure to hear, to mix dry humor and humanity, to make the film recognizable but uniquely beautiful, dark, dramatic, and funny - that's what Coens achieved in Fargo which has been supposedly the Best film they ever made.All of Coens' fans have their own favorite film but it is hard to disagree that with Fargo, Coens sealed the place in Cinema Hall of Fame. Fargo is a movie of many dimensions. As many of Coens' films, it centers on a botched crime that includes kidnapping gone terribly wrong. Many viewers see it as a dark comical crime/mystery thriller which it is but it is much more. It rises to the high tragedy, and it is one of the most beautiful gentle love stories committed to screen which is very unusual for Coens. What I especially love in Fargo - the perfect balance between the scenes of building suspense, graphic violence, humor, and the real drama from the lives of the real people.The visual palette of the film with color white dominating the screen is stunning, and the snow that covers American Midwest for what seems the eternal winter, is as important character for the film as the rest of them. The sorrowful music score deserves a special mention for creating the mood.It has been told a lot about dream cast that Coens gathered for the film. Of all stars, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy got the most recognition, and very deservingly so. Macy is amazing and a spot- on, and in the final scene of the film, genuinely heartbreaking. It is impossible to imagine anybody else in the role of Jerry Lundegaard, the desperate man who came up with the perfect scheme to become rich without hurting anyone and whose good intentions paved the road directly to hell of Shakespearean proportions. Macy was determined from the beginning that it was HIS role in spite Coens' doubts even after the second reading. He did not hesitate to beg them, and the result proved absolutely terrific.Any way we look at Fargo, it is a great work of Cinema that would make it difficult for its creators to overpass its perfection. As a true masterpiece, it only gets better as time passes and it turns with new facets with every new viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Coen brothers' black comedy masterpiece,"The Coen brothers flash the based on true story disclaimer for a real 1987 Minnesota incident. It's one of the misdirections. Jerry Lundegaard (William H.

Jerry is miserable working for Wade in his car dealership and he's in desperate need for cash. The kidnapping goes horribly wrong when more people get killed including a police officer. Pregnant sheriff Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) goes to investigate.This is a great movie. It has its funny moments. It has great visual touches, the quirky characters, and the off-kilter style that is the hallmark of the Coen brothers. Macy is incredible as the sniffling little weasel. It walks the absurd line between dark and comedy. It has plenty of both. It is simply wonderful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I just can't say anything good about this movie.,"I have written a few reviews on IMDb, and this is the first time I feel compelled to write a negative one.8.4 IMDb score. Really?Just don't watch this movie. You are not getting those 90 minutes back, and you will really retreat it.Steve Buscemi is awesome as usual, but otherwise the movie just falls apart.The movie is slow, boring, and it makes no sense whatsoever. I understand it's based on a real story, but it's been adapted poorly (or not adapted at all). The side stories add nothing to the main plot (if there is such a thing in this film), and they are added in such a way that make them look like editing mistakes. It actually looks like they mixed their reels and just pasted things from other films.Besides that, there is no conflict. Just a lot of characters that are truly stupid, make all kind of mistakes, and most end up dead or imprisoned.(warning, spoilers ahead)There are several clearly connected crimes. So the investigator, who is a colorless boring character, just plays it exactly by the book and finds the killers immediately. There is just no story. She goes to the crime scene, everything is bloody obvious, so she just makes a few calls, interviews two people, and finds out she has to go to a nearby city. She goes there, and finds the killers who happen to have the car just parked outside waiting to be found. But before doing that, she stops to meet a creepy Asian guy that she hasn't seen for a long time that wants to bang her, but she says no and goes away.Yes, that is the actual plot.On the side, you see a lot of terminally stupid criminals doing everything wrong, a desperate guy that needs money, but WHY is never explained, so he makes a lot of blatantly obvious mistakes and ends up in jail.I can't even begin to explain why the movie is so bad, because it doesn't even deserve much explanation. There is no conflict, no story, no characters. Just a lot of stupid people that kill each other in the most meaningless ways.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Shiny Happy Tedium,"What is it about these movies from the Coen brothers which appeals to so many people? How can anyone enjoy a slow paced, over-the-top acted borefest with an impressive collection of the most annoying personalities available. Movies which don't seem to go anywhere despite the fact that there is plenty of story to go about. It must be something masochistic which I don't get.Fargo.Surely none of the characters are real life persons but yet I'm not watching a cartoon. None of the dialog seems to be of this Earth, yet I'm not watching a re-enactment of our planet by the inhabitants of Planet KzOrp. So I can only imagine that I'm watching a comedy or at least a movie with an attempt at humor. I mean, what else could it be? It's too preposterous to be a thriller and the characters and the screenplay are too bizarre to make it a drama.I must have been misinformed about this genre of film. Because it has always been my understanding that a comedy had something to do with laughter and amusement. A ridiculous situation could become quite funny, but truly not when the whole movie is ridiculous as well. Same goes for the abominable, hateful characters.If the movie Groundhog Day, arguably amongst the best comedies ever made, was made by the Coen brothers, they would have had the entire village reliving the same day over and over again. And not only that, they would have made every character in that movie be twice as arrogant (Murray), dorky (Larry) and desirable (MacDowell) etc. Its result would be the a monstrosity of a caricature .This movie lacks everything what Groundhog Day makes a good comedy; namely finesse, subtlety and something which makes the viewer not being alienated from the characters and above all, something actually funny going on. (Since when is a kidnapping and a lot of deaths a funny setting? Because Buscemi and Macy are in it?..give me a break, this is hardly Pulp Fiction)For a crime/thriller based on actual fact, it lacks a seriousness and perhaps even respect to the events that have taken place. And the lack of means of time-travel aside, watching Fargo, I was expecting Jeff Bridges to walk onto the set looking for his stupid rug which would have been my longed for queue to press the eject button.So all in all it is not a comedy, it is not a crime/drama/thriller but simply a Coen production. To me it's just an incredibly annoying in-between-genre film which cannot decide what it's supposed to be. Therefore it misses the mark on all counts which make the redeeming qualities of the production (and there are a lot) seem sadly wasted.But it seems to be the minority opinionthe bandwagon ride is so comfy..",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Beautifully grotesque, funny and exciting, typical Coen film.","The setting of ""Fargo"" with its snowy landscapes reminds me of Scandinavian productions. The crime thriller, enriched with black humor, is quite exciting and entertaining. The actors do a good job. I think an Oscar for Frances Louise McDormand is absolutely appropriate and well deserved.Directed by the Coen brothers (No Country for Old Men, True Grit), ""Fargo"" is a black-humored, grotesque crime thriller that paints a portrait of the provincial inhabitants of the north of the USA that is as affectionate as it is curious.""Fargo"" successfully combines bizarre situations, quirky characters and crude violence with a crime plot that may not be particularly innovative, but is certainly cleverly constructed and always has a few surprises in store. Added to this is the strongly captured wintry atmosphere of snowy Minnesota and a very playful ensemble of actors, from which Frances McDormand stands out in particular as a pregnant police officer who combines an engaging warmth with determination and shrewdness.The Coen brothers could have tightened the tension a little more here and there and cut out some scenes that are irrelevant to the main plot - such as the policewoman's meeting with her old acquaintance Mike (Steve Park) - but even so, ""Fargo"" is brilliantly entertaining with its finely tuned mixture of humor and thrills.The movie is rounded off by the very nice, wintry atmosphere in snowy Minnesota, where the clocks tick differently and everything has this rural backwater character. I like movies like this that are set in more remote regions and ""Fargo"" also captures this charm in a fun and likeable way. Ultimately, the movie is easily accessible and provides good entertainment.A few somewhat unnecessary subplots and humor passages that didn't click with me keep ""Fargo"" from being my favorite Coens film so far, but it's still a very successful and worthwhile film.Conclusion: Exciting story, somewhat dorky kidnappers, peppered with quirky characters, pleasantly restrained touches of humor.

Charming in it's own way.,"Fargo is an interesting film. While it may not be for everyone it's got a unique charm that is difficult to dislike. All of the events (even the darker elements of the film) are almost satirical in nature. The characters all act in this funny, uncanny, almost awkward manner, and my wife and I couldn't help but find ourselves giggling and cracking up at several points as the events of the story transpired. The actors all do a fantastic job portraying their roles, especially Frances McDormand as one of cinema's most unexpected protagonists, the impossible to hate, Margie Gunderson. Only the Coen Brothers could pull off making an 8 months pregnant police detective the protagonist of a film and it work so well.

Fargo Review,"""There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don'tcha know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day. Well, I just don't understand it."" - Marge GundersonPure genius. Those two words are what best describes Coen Brothers' Fargo. I saw this for the first time, and, I'm happy to say, it ranks up there with The Big Lebowski and No Country for Old Men as one of the Coen's best films with its dark and quirky writing, its gorgeous cinematography, a solid performance from much of the cast, and its mixture of black comedy, violence, and satire that only the Coen Brothers can pull off.This dark and quirky story begins with Jerry Lundegaard, a down-on-his-luck car salesman who is hard up for money to finance for his family. So, he hires two crooks to kidnap his wife so he can extort a ransom from his father-in-law. The plan seems to be going well, until one minor incident leads to three roadside murders and the plan slowly starts falling apart. In the center of all this craziness is Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief who is investigating the murders and she starts to realize that the murders are connected to Jerry's ill-thought out plan.Despite opening with a disclaimer that this ""based on a true story"", it's not really based on a true story, although it was loosely based on a real life case. But it perfectly sets the tone to the absurdity that is about to unfold. What the Coen Brothers do best is their perfect blend of dark humor, satire, and excessive violence and execute it in a flawless manner. You can't help but to laugh at all of the misfortunes that is happening to the characters, like Carl's short-tempered outbursts when something goes wrong or when Jerry is on the verge of having a nervous breakdown.I must say that I have to give huge props to the cinematography, courtesy of Roger Deakins. It gives it a seemly peaceful feeling of the snowy Minnesota countryside and the music gives it an old time folk feel that just fits perfectly to the setting. One of my favorite shots is that overhead shot of Jerry walking to his car in the snow-covered parking lot.The performances from the film's star-studded cast are all excellent. From William H. Macy as the timid Jerry, to Steve Buscemi as the loud, trash talking Carl Showalter, to even Peter Stormare as the emotionless and mostly mute Gaear Grimsrud. But the best of the cast is Francis McDormand as Marge. She's the only character out of all of them that is pleasant, whereas some of them, mainly the crooks, are crazy. She is seen as having a happy and modest life, has a loving and supporting husband, is witty, and, despite the situation that she's in and her life as a police chief, she still maintains her upbeat and ""Minnesota Nice"" attitude.Overall, Fargo is a genuine classic that manages to rank up to masterpiece-level of quality. Certainly, one of the Coen Brothers' best films.Final Verdict: 10/10 with the Epic Seal of Awesomeness",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Mr. Macy, I salute you...","William H.Macy is my fave actor at the moment. He has been in a long list alongside such names like John Cusack, Kevin Spacey, and Matt Damon. To me, Macy makes this film a whole lot better than it should be. To me, it's a very basic plot with an overall average acting performance bar the unbeatable Mr. Macy. Frances McDormand got an oscar for her performance. I couldn't believe this after watching the film because to me she comes across as a very dim-witted talentless actress. Of course, a lot of people would say that was what her character's personality was like, but to me, I see her as not a dimwitted character, but as a poor actress who is failing to make a connection with me. I despised her in this film.Macy on the other hand, played his character with such excellence, that this film was the reason why I love the guy as much as I do now. His character is perfect, he says the silly lines perfectly, and when he's in a pickle, I love the way he makes it seem like nothing's happening... the scene in the motel bathroom as an example.The storyline as I previously mentioned is very basic. A car salesman needs money, so he hires two guys to hold his wife hostage, and then claim a huge ransom off her wealthy father. Things go wrong though due to the mistakes of the two criminals, and then it's a case of the hot-shot police officer to find the criminals who've left a bloody trail in their wake. It doesn't sound gripping stuff, tho neither The Usual Suspects on its back cover and we all know about that don't we?So Fargo... it is good, don't get me wrong. Some of the acting performances are top notch but don't expect a twisting crime thriller... it's more comedy than serious!PROS: + Macy + The conversations within are pretty funny. + Steve Buscemi plays a good crook.CONS:Frances McDormand does my head in! She's so annoying! - The storyline's a bit basic. - That other crook lacks belief. - Nothing stands out as a major point in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Fargo is Flawless,"Fargo is probably the last American Film masterpiece of the Twentieth Century and the last 25 years. Highly original and imaginative it is a depressing tale told in a dark comic style with flesh and blood characters intricately and smoothly connected with dialog and plot twists all brilliantly conceived by the brothers Coen.Sleazy car dealer Jerry Lundergaard hatches a plan to have his wife kidnapped so he can pocket some of the ransom his emasculating father in-law will have to fork over. Through one of his mechanics he gets the name of a low life who might be interested and travels to Fargo to work out the plan. Things go awry from the outset though and soon the cold snowy landscape is littered with dead bodies. Solving the case is left up to a last trimester pregnant Sheriff from Brainerd, Minnesota who initially comes across as a little slow on the draw.Fargo is flawlessly constructed with subplots girding the storyline, enriching characterization and sharply calibrating the suspenseful pace. The frozen north setting is a refreshing change from big city and vacation land locales that dominate feature films and the Coens expertly put it to use to create mood, evoke humor and accent imagery. It is the best use of snow since Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller.William Macy as Jerry takes the car salesman stereotypes to new lows with one of the most memorable cloyingly unctuous characters in film history as he dismantles his family in pursuit of wealth. Whether trying to tack on extras to customers or keeping police at bay while surrounded in a motel room he remains steadfast in deceptive practice until the end. As the Sheriff Frances McDormand evolves from small town cop to Colombo subtlety and successfully without fanfare while Coen economically brings more depth and mystery to her with dry comic snapshots of her married life and a meeting with an old school chum. As one of the blundering kidnappers Steve Buscemi is a motormouth of comic complaint while his taciturn, hypochondrial partner played by Peter Stomare (a lot more grounded in reality than the Frankenstein creation running amok in the Coen's No Country for Old Men) is icily terrifying.Fargo is the Coens' best film to date. They fell into a malaise after The Big Lebowski with heavy handed comedies (The Lady Killers, Intolerable Cruelty), dependence on charming movie star George Clooney as well as a flaccid and forgettable foray into black and white (The Man Who Wasn't There) before going Oscar with the slow moving overrated Old Country, followed by the praise worthy acerbic screwball comedy Burn After Reading. Even with their failures they had more to offer than quality work of tamer directors by offering razzle dazzle camera work and original off-beat characters. Taking chances they sometimes pushed the envelope beyond credulity but with Fargo they give us a perfect measure of style and realism with a dark comic soul that is rich in detail and perception of this thing known as the human comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Screwball crime film,"I hesitate to call this a comedy film. I found parts of it funny but more in the way that Wes Anderson films are dainty rather than laugh-out-loud funny. The storyline features a clueless and bumbling car salesman attempting a hare-brained scheme with equally incompetent criminals, all juxtaposed a disarmingly mundane and friendly Midwest setting. The stand-out feature of this film is the acting, as the characters are all perfect depictions of those who simply cannot get anything right! I see more inspiration from old screwball films than traditional crime dramas. After a spate of Martin Scorsese films, Heat and Scarface, the easygoing style of this film was a breath of fresh air.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A freezing fable of stupidity,"Fargo: ***.5*Fargo is a strange little movie. It is, in my opinion, the Cohen Brothers best film. It deals with a very serious subject, yet somehow it does so without taking itself overly serious. There is a very realistic quality to be found here- The subject matter is dark, yet there is a crack of light shining through always. The conversations are spot on with how they would probably be spoken in real life.McDormands character, the pregnant Marge, is the persistent pursuer but she is not obsessive like so many other movie clichéd 'good guys' are when it comes to catching their adversary. She is involved, but remains detached, just as 95% of real cops will be. You see it clearest in the conversations she has with her fellow officers; husband, and just about everyone else she speaks to. You really feel that she is, as her character says during an interview, just doing her job. This realism is not just present in Marge, but in every character. None are over the top, though the accents are probably slightly exaggerated.Jerry and his cronies are stupid. We never really find out Jerry's original troubles, but we are front row center for the idiocy that follows. There are no super intelligent characters which you find in many other crime dramas. There is only those who have some wits and common sense, and those who are helplessly daft.Personally, I loved this movie. It's quirky; it's real; it's charming; and its just plain fun (though bordering on the edge of painful) to watch this freezing fable of stupidity unfold. I did however feel that the ending was a little rushed, but this is not really a bad thing. I felt that the scene of Marge with her friend Mike in the city could have been removed, and that time could have gone to filling out the ending a little more. All in all, this nitpick is rather insignificant, and does little, if nothing at all to distract from the quality of the movie.I wanted to give this movie a 10, but it is lacking something, i don't know what, which is preventing me from giving it so. I also feel that it deserves more than a nine: 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Fargo is just brilliant,"Last year I watched rhe first season of the Fargo Series and it blew away my mind. Definitely one of the best seasons I watched my entire life.

My expectations were high, the story the movie is based in is the same like the series.And I did not get dissapointed!

A Black Comedy/Thriller from The Coen Brothers...Need I say more?,"Going into a Coen brothers movie expecting something traditional is ridiculous by any stretch of the imagination. Any movie directed by the Coens is going to be severely warped in one way or another, either by approach (""No Country for Old Men"") or by their sense of humor (everything else).By all accounts, ""Fargo"" is a murder mystery, though it is anything but straightforward. This is not ""Law & Order."" It's about a simple crime that spiraled way out of control for all the principal characters. That's understandable, since everyone populating this story is either hopelessly inept or hopelessly stupid.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman who needs money to open a new car lot. But since he thinks that the only person who could give the money to him, his father-in-law (Harve Presnell), won't put down the money, he hires two thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife (Kristen Rudrud) and split the ransom that his father-in-law will pay. Unfortunately for Jerry, the two thugs he hired don't have any brain cells between them, and Jerry is probably the most incompetent criminal the world has ever seen. Things get out of hand very quickly and the bodies start piling up. This draws the attention of the very pregnant Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand).It may seem like I've given a lot away, but really, I haven't. That's just the set-up for a series of unexpected (not to mention bizarre) twist and turns that the Coens throw at us. Many thrillers, even the best ones, have easily projected paths. ""Fargo"" is anything but.Despite IMDb listing it as such, merely calling ""Fargo"" a crime/thriller is an insufficient description. The film is as much a comedy as anything else. From the character's stupidity or complete ineptitude, to the funny accents and way of speaking that everyone has, the Coens never take ""Fargo"" too seriously.The acting is the best part of the film. Frances McDormand is a real scene-stealer, and in many ways the best part of the movie. Marge is relentlessly chirpy and optimistic, and she's easily the smartest character in the film (although that's not exactly saying much). ""Fargo"" really takes off whenever she's on screen. William H. Macy gives his best performance as Jerry. As reprehensible as his plan is, you can't help but feel sorry for the guy. He's so bad at being a criminal, it's really pathetic. But seeing him try to get out of the jams he gets himself into are nothing short of hilarious. Steve Buscemi and Harve Presnell are good as the brainless kidnappers, and even though they think they're smart, they're really, REALLY dumb.Joel Coen has a knack for twisting the story just enough so that it's funny without lampooning the genre. This isn't a satire, but the jabs it takes almost make it so. It has its share of violence, including a scene that in any other movie would be completely sick and disturbing, but as told by the Coens, it's so shocking and absurd that it's laugh-out-loud hilarious.Roger Ebert heaped tons of praise on ""Fargo,"" saying that ""Movies like 'Fargo' are the reasons why I love movies."" While I greatly enjoyed ""Fargo,"" I can't heap that much praise on it. Some of the cuts in the film are too long, and I half-expected a commercial break. Additionally, there's one scene where Marge reunites with a guy from high school that, while funny and irreverent, really doesn't add anything to the story. Still, it's enjoyable enough that it's hardly worth complaining about.While it may not be perfect, ""Fargo"" is still a very good film, especially if you have a warped sense of humor.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

McDormand is a queen!,"""Fargo"" is a 1996 (comedic) thriller (officially) directed by Joel Coen starring Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. I gotta admit that I've already watched it roughly one year ago when I had personal issues and was in a bad mood that resulted in a disability to like films in general and that I heavily disliked this film. Now that the worst of my personal problem is over and I'm able to appreciate everything again, I had the strange feeling that I didn't do this film justice and that I had to give it a rewatch and after finding this nice little Mediabook I knew I had to set things straight. Like I expected, this film is actually pretty good. There's so much to cherish in it and I still cannot believe that, as the opening titles state, all these depicted events are based on a true story. It's just insane. What appears to be another brilliant gathering of thoughts of the Coen brothers really happened in 1987. They took it and made it a brilliant comedic thriller. Yes, I say it's a comedic thriller, because overall it might be a thriller, but there too many scenes that feature crude humour that I couldn't leave that part out. Actually, it's undeniable that in it's cold core it's a black satirical crime flick. First of all, the way how the plot is constructed and links several storylines with weird, but original characters is simply superb. It's full of funny running gags, dialogue and it perfectly combines the right amount of abstruse humour and true earnestness. From the wannabe gangster duo, to a desperate car salesman in the need for cash to a pregnant, but still determined police chief there's not a single character that is boring in any way. This cold-blooded thriller features so many outstanding actors and actresses that made them come to life with such an easiness. Leading lady Frances McDormand (who only has had one hour of screentime to again proof that she's the greatest) delivered an ingenious performance as the protagonist police chief. She's such a sweet lady and she dominates every single scene she's in, also the way she speaks is just lovely. Definitely one of the greatest actresses in the business. But let's not forget to praise Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the quirky and evilly hilarious kidnappers and William H. Macy as the salesman who also knew to entertain with their weird charisma. Set in a scenery of frozen highways and endless widths of cold snow they all manage to create this unique atmosphere. Also, mostly enabled by the breathtaking cinematography of Roger Deakins. I could seriously feel the cold of the film crawling down my spine although I was sitting in my warm room under my even warmer blanket. It's so beautifully shot and moody that I still cannot understand why it took the Academy more than twenty years to award that man. He's a virtuoso with the camera! All in all, this shockingly beautiful and brutally bloody snow satire is an outstanding entry to the independent cinema, with an inimitable atmosphere and tense music and unbelievably real story lead by a magnificent McDormand. It took me another watch to appreciate this classic flick and feel redemption. Better late than never.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A solid story is supported by a weird and wonderful array of characters and some sharp writing,"Jerry Lundegaard is a car dealer who has money problems.  Unable to ask his wealthy father-in-law for money, Jerry employs two criminal types to kidnap his wife and then split the ransom with Jerry.  However when a cop pulls over the two criminals, a triple shooting is the result and the police get involved.  With Jerry getting pressure from the kidnappers now that thing has gone sour and Officer Marge Gunderson making progress in her investigation, things are far from as straightforward as was originally planned.Getting past the whole `true story' nonsense, this is easily one of the Coen's most polished films as well as one of their most enjoyable.  The film opens with a bleak, snowy scene with a great sweeping score and pretty much sets the tone for a film that feels bigger than it actually is.  The opening scene between Jerry and his two contracted hoods is really good and is typical of the comic tone that runs all the way through the film.  The plot is cleverly written and so much more than another `job gone wrong' thing, however what drives the film is the weird web of unusual characters that we encounter along the way.  Setting the film in a part of American with Scandinavian roots was clever as it gives the characters funny accents before you even worry about what they are going to say with them!  The screenplay won an Oscar and it deserved it simply for the dialogue and the characters it creates.  It is a dark film but it is one that fans of the Coen brothers' universe will find funny.Of course it helps no end to have a great cast to deliver it.  McDormand won the Oscar despite only being one of several good performances in the film. Her Marge is funny yet relentless in her pursuit.  Macy is as reliable as ever and it is his increasingly frantic performance that is the best of the film for my money - weedy, pathetic and hopelessly out of his depth but funny with it.  Buscemi and Stormare are both very good for very different reasons and the rest of the support cast is comprised of many strange characters who are funny.  Only the very occasional bit hits a sour note, but this is very occasional and doesn't hurt the film one little bit.Overall this may not be a true story but that is not to say that it isn't fascinating anyway - who says truth is better than fiction?!  The roundly great performances do great work with a deserved Oscar winner of a screen play that fills a solid crime storyline with all manner of characters that produce a gripping and funny film that is one of the best and most accessible of the Coen brother films.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Ordinary Good Defeats Ordinary Evil,"Evil as depicted in films such as ""Fargo"" and ""Badlands"" is much more disturbing than in films in which evil geniuses or devilish fiends systematically carry out their plans. In ""Fargo"" unintelligent evil is matched against seemingly ordinary good people as embodied by Frances McDormand and good wins hands down. And it's not just a case of good defeats evil by catching and punishing it. That's the genius of this film. Enjoying the ordinary life shines through in Margie's relationship with her husband and the film does not patronize their homespun but genuine affection. Margie's comment to the dimwitted murderer about it being a beautiful day and ruining it over ""a little bit of money"" rings true because of the regrettably ridiculous tangle of folly caused by greed and insensitivity that has preceded it. Margie's final comment to her husband that they are ""doing pretty good"" is perfectly in keeping with the tale and its tone. Brutality has been beaten by simple human decency but with no overt sentimentality or grandly moral speechifying.This is a depiction of humankind at their worst and their best. It is a roller-coaster ride and possibly the best film ever made. And the score is just brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
fools in the snow,"When it was released in 1996, ""Fargo"" met public and especially critical acclaim and collected several rewards. But I think that if the Prize for the Best Directing at the Cannes festival was absolutely justified, on the other hand, Frances McDormand didn't deserve her Oscar in 1997. William H.Macy should have won it. His performance as an hypocritical and dishonest car seller is powerful and unforgettable.What is amazing in ""Fargo"" are the landscapes, the sceneries and above all the characters. The Coen brothers said about the movie: "" the landscapes, the sceneries are an integral part of the movie. They are typical of the Midwest as well as the characters with their sensitivity and their mentality"". They know what they are talking about since they come from the Midwest, more precisely from the Minnesota. As a consequence, they must have been at ease by making this thrilling movie.Concerning the characters, they are the subject of a realistic and down-to-earth description. Each of them has a different but not very status-enhancing characteristic: William H.Macy's cues are almost always hesitating, unfinished or unsure, the two gangsters are just silly guys (one of them nearly never talks) and most of the inhabitants including Frances McDormand are narrow-minded. By this way, the Coen brothers wanted to underline their meanness of mind and the fact that they are firmly rooted in their land of the Minnesota.Apart from the characters and although the movie is based on a true story, I am obliged to recognize that the script and the way the movie is designed have nothing new. But nonetheless, the tone is daring, there's black humor cleverly used (notably in bloody moments) that contrasts with a quiet even neutral directing. As for the snowy landscapes, they will later inspire Sam Raimi for ""a simple plan"" (1998), a movie as successful as ""Fargo"".""Fargo"" is eventually the finest movie made by the Coen brothers and its place in the top 250 is thoroughly justified.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Compelling Crime Story,"2 September 2000Fargo is a captivating thriller that has a straightforward story but it's effective because it catches the viewer's attention in it's artistic value. The performances are sublime, every character is interesting.Steve Buscemi and Peter Storemare are great together and both play their roles perfectly. Frances McDormand won an oscar for her performance. William H. Macy makes you sympathise for his character because of how desperate and troubled he looks throughout the movie. The performances are top notch, the entire cast did a great job.The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery is ominous and can feel quite claustrophobic. It seems as if the snow adds tension to the story and keeps these characters in a bubble of trouble. A place you can't escape from. Every shot feels precised and intricate as if it was meant to be this way.The story caught my interest throughout it's entire runtime. The movie creates tension in a subtle way by quickly showing the viewer the danger without notice, all of that is done without a single sound signifying danger is on the way. This technique should be used more often in horror movies because it creates a tense atmosphere for a considerably long amount of time as opposed to a few seconds of jumpiness, it is the opposite of a ""jump scare"". I might not be picking the best film but there are other films that prove this technique of film-making is one to keep.They could've improved the pace of the movie if they got rid of the useless side-story of the former high school friend trying to seduce McDormand. That scene should've been included in the deleted scenes. It would've also been a bit informative if we could understand how Mr Lundegaard got himself in this tough situation.I recommend Fargo for it's interesting plot, enticing characters and overall artistic value.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Everything Goes progressively wrong,"There seems to be a Tarantino influence to this film, with a few twists. There is no snappy dialogue. Indeed there is almost a total lack of dialogue. The two villains barely talk. There is also no great mystery to the detective deduction. The female cop unravels the mystery fairly effortlessly, as the crime goes progressively wrong. The film jolts along with serial shocks of sudden and sporadic violence - like a cartoon, complete with squirty blood.The thing that starts to irritate is the dim-witted stupidity of almost everyone, and the eventually irritating use of 'yah, yah', every time anyone talks. Most characters seem to be portrayed as total thickos out in the sticks of Brainerd, Minnesota. Brain-nerd,get it?""Oh yah.....yah yah"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Bleak comedy,"On the strength of liking the rather coarse In Bruges I was recommended to see this one, one that had passed me by but trailed for me by the recommender as an even blacker comedy. Being a sucker for black comedies I complied, and found it ingenious and engrossing fiction, but with a streak of nastiness not in In Bruges. Brainerd definitely looked colder than Bruges!Geeky husband (Macy) arranges for two hit men, one dumb the other kind of funny looking, to kidnap his wife so they can all share the ransom money to come from her rich father. Except it all goes wrong - especially for a lot of innocent passers by, which is something I always find difficult to extract humour from as I never know what or in particular who lies around the next corner myself. Some funny alleged Minnesota mannerisms and accents from the cast, the pregnant Sheriff Marge had some of the most whimsical lines and was a convincing eccentric, to this outsider anyway. Favourite bits: Her police outrage when she sees Macy Fleein' The Interview; the funny looking guy getting shot in the teeth and continually whinging about it; trying to guess exactly how Macy's wife met her end, how often Ya was uttered throughout and where's the money buried. Nice photography and the music was atmospheric and excellent too, although it sometimes put in mind 17th century France. I just wish the main characters and their many foibles had been fleshed out a little more, otoh it was all nicely packed into 90 minutes...maybe the rather pointless meeting of Marge with Mike could have been jettisoned?Although redolent of Twin Peaks it's one of the best films from the '90's I've seen from my limited experience, episodic but good and enigmatic enough to bear repeated viewings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A hideous, hyper-inflated bleakscape of a movie","What galls me most about this movie specifically and the Coen brothers' movies generally is that they all reveal the insipidness of both the Coens and their fans. What they can't achieve with excellent dialogue, well-spun stories, and logical continuity in plotting, the Coens make up for via blood, lust, more blood, and then more blood. Vanquished from their movies is any sense of humanity or hope, and we are left in what I can best describe as a ""bleakscape"" - where the great positive is the presence of so much that is negative. I do delight, however, in the spectacle of reading swooning fans' fawning tributes to the Coens' ""films"" (and yes, their fans will watch only ""films"").Utterly unbelievable in the bleak, depressing, and joyless tableaux they offer, the Coen films are the perfect answer to a society full of soulless narcissists.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Great flick with a too abrupt ending,"What more can be said after 487 viewer comments? For #488, all I will say is that, after watching this three times, Fargo is a fine piece of cinema, with an emphasis on a minimalist approach to story-telling and without much in the way of theatrics. The setting is bleak, the dialog is mostly direct and to-the-point, and the characters are well-drawn, what few main characters there are. I thought Steve Buscemi was wonderful as the villain in a humorously sick way. The one negative comment I have is that I feel the movie ends much too abruptly: too many loose threads left hanging. I thought the viewer was entitled to know a little bit more about why Jerry (William H. Macy) would go to such outlandish lengths to raise money as to stage his own wife's kidnapping. The fact that he ""owed money"" or ""got in over his head"" wasn't quite enough for me as an explanation since I had kept asking myself during the course of this escapade, ""Why? Exactly why is he doing this?"" We never really find out except in the most vague terms. All in all, probably my favorite Coen Brothers film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Wry, off-beat and undeniably brilliant","What can be said of Fargo that has not been said before? Fargo is a film that cannot be cornered with any easy definition. The Coen brothers have defined themselves with a style that is unique and refreshing and Fargo stands as one of their masterworks. Equal parts crime-caper, drama and comedy, Fargo takes its audience on a journey where every turn is a breathe of fresh air and every line of dialog is something that you could never translate to another film.Frances McDormand shines in her lead role as the pregnant cop who has a small-town, matter-of-fact way about her that is both endearing and unpredictable, a performance easily earning her Oscar win. William H Macy is as memorable as ever as the car dealer whose ransom master-plan and life spins further and further out of control. And while Steve Buscemi is known for his quirky performances, in Fargo his quirkiness almost seems to make his character appear the most ""normal"" of the bunch.While certainly not a film for everybody (many in my family still don't know what to make of it) it is an easy recommendation for anybody who wants to experience a truly unique, original film.

A quirky and highly entertaining film,"'Fargo' is another quirky gem from the Coen brothers and one of the best black comedy I've seen from the 90s. I always finds the Coens' films to be hugely enjoyable but this one was particularly rewarding for me.I thought the plot was great and the characters fun and entertaining. The dark and subtle humour was also right up my street and provided lots of good laughs.I'm not sure how much of this supposedly 'true story' is actually true, but the storyline was clearly never intended to be taken seriously.

The start of the myth that are the Coen Brothers,"The first big hit by the directing duo Joel and Ethan Coen really heralded the somewhat different kind of filmmaking. Further films like No Country For Old Men, A Serious Man or True Grit followed and finally established the Coen Brothers as masters of their craft. Fargo contains all the elements that their style stands for: unorthodox violence, the discreet incorporation of comedic aspects and a plot that seems very simple at first glance, but which brings much more meaning and hidden social criticism after watching the film several times.Besides the Coen Brothers, the film was also the big breakthrough of acting icon Frances McDormand. Her character Marge Gunderson does not appear as often as one would expect from the ""main character"". When she is seen, she delights with her amiable nature, which is topped off by her stubborn naivety and belief in the good. McDormand also masters the Minnesota accent perfectly, which only makes her character more likeable and refreshing. She is never really aware of the gravity of the situation at any point and is constantly miles off the mark as the police officer in charge of the occurring crime. William H. Macy's slightly crazy character Jerry Lundegaard is the centre of the film at the beginning. The main action starts from him and he is pretty much the opposite of Marge: he always knows what is going on and is shady without end. Although he has no real evil intentions, pretty much all of his plans go awry, leaving him constantly on the run and always quick to lose his cool. Macy plays big and makes this shambles of a man weirdly likeable. Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are responsible for the more brutal moments as the crooks and are hilarious in their scenes together because of the difference of their characters.It is not for nothing that a television series of the same name was developed based on Fargo. The peculiarity of this film still has a cult following for many. Also beautiful to look at is the completely snowed-in Minnesota and the cast covered in fur coats. The performances by McDormand, Macy and Buscemi of course help the plot, which is a little dull towards the middle, enormously. It picks up towards the end without offering a big showdown or explosive finale. Fargo is generally a rather quietly constructed film that uses its violent scenes very selectively. What is so impressive is the socio-critical factor behind it. There is a clear demarcation between good and bad people. The Coen Brothers are not above depicting this in sometimes very subtle but also extreme ways. Fargo is rightly an important part of film history that should be watched alone for the fact that the Coen Brothers really took off with it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Fargo"" is a work of impeccable script and unique dynamic with three parallel narratives, which is, at the same time, fast and slow without ever losing harmony","Masters in the art of telling a good story through cinematographic cameras, the Coen brothers tend to stand out for their very peculiar characteristics, such as their narrative economy, the hints of black humor that permeate their films and their remarkable ability to create striking scenes. All of this can be found in the excellent ""Fargo"", a feature that certainly deserves a prominent place among the countless interesting works of the Coens, which is no small thing, considering the vast and qualified filmography of the duo. Beneath the surface of a suspense thriller and police investigation, the screenplay for ""Fargo"" (written, as usual, by Ethan and Joel Coen themselves) tells the story of desperate Jerry (William H. Macy), a manager at a car dealership. Automaker who faces financial difficulties and decides to plan the kidnapping of his own wife, Jean (Kristin Rudrud). Problem is, things don't go as well as planned, and when kidnappers Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) commit multiple murders, determined cop Marge (Frances McDormand) starts investigating the case.Responsible not only for the script, direction and production, but also for editing ""Fargo"" under the fictitious name of Roderick Jaynes, the Coens confirm their ability to keep the viewer attentive to the intriguing events that follow, leading the narrative in a direct and efficient. Filled with interesting dialogues, the creative script opens up a range of possibilities at every moment, always brilliantly working on how chance influences our lives. However, unlike the characters who can never predict what will happen next, the Coens demonstrate total control over what we see on the screen, creating absolutely electrifying moments (which I will come back to in a moment) amidst the sea of tranquility of the peaceful city from Brainerd. However, despite all the suspense, ""Fargo"" is also filled with a lot of dark humor, featuring a series of hilarious moments that serve to break the growing tension of the narrative, such as when Jean runs away tied up on arrival at the captivity or in the funny interview of Marge with the hookers.Betting on graphic violence, as in the scene of the murder of the policeman, in the delivery of money in a hotel and in the arrest of Grimsrud, the Coens create a chain of events that only worsen Jerry's situation and, precisely because they show the tragic results of their actions, make the viewer care about the fate of the characters. However, despite working very well as a thriller, ""Fargo"" relies on dark humor to address other issues, functioning as a study on the lifestyle of that peculiar region of the USA. One of the aspects that deserves extra attention is the cinematography, directed by Roger Deakins. Jerry is normally framed at the shoulders or closer. This type of cut accentuates the intensity of the scenes: the viewer can feel almost trapped by the character's gaze or emotions, bearing in mind that the actor's proximity to the camera leaves little more space to look at, just the expression of disgrace of this man. Like him, we have nowhere to escape. One of the most visually striking scenes takes place after the protagonist's father-in-law refuses to give him the amount of money that would completely cover his debts. Jerry ends up leaving the building and sees him from above, heading for his car. The canvas is completely covered by the white of the snow and the only color is his small and insignificant figure, illustrating the solitude he was relegated to, completely abandoned to his fate. Furthermore, the vases symmetrically placed in space almost corner man in his own misery.Investing in icy colors and masterfully exploring the rawness of the neighboring regions of Minnesota and North Dakota, full of roads surrounded by snow that blend into the skyline and create a look that is both beautiful and frightening at the same time, Deakins' photography is crucial to illustrate the loneliness of the people who live there. This isolation even collaborates to increase the tension in key moments of the narrative, such as the night of the murders, where we know that the innocents who cross the path of the kidnappers will rarely escape with their lives on that cold and abandoned road. Incidentally, this chase scene is among the great moments of the feature, making the viewer glued to the chair while following its outcome.Wearing sober suits or clothes that convey an austere image (Mary Zophres costumes), the characters of ""Fargo"" represent the central force of the narrative. With his drawn accents and sharp dialogues that betray the funny way of speaking, even supporting characters with small participations become a separate attraction, as Mr. Mohra (Bain Boehlke), who delights us by telling how she heard from the drunken Carl where he would be hiding. On the other hand, this grace will hardly be perceived by a spectator who does not have at least some notion of English (it would be like trying to explain to a foreigner the grace of an accent from any region of Brazil). Also amusing is Peter Stormare's performance as Grimsrud, Carl's mute and menacing partner - who, as usual, is masterfully played by Steve Buscemi, a true expert in the art of playing criminals.Appearing fragile and hesitant most of the time, Jerry from the great William H. Macy seems unable to impose himself in any dialogue, stopping to speak at the slightest sign that he will be interrupted and stammering several times, in a clear sign of lack of confidence that the actor demonstrates it very well. This feeling, combined with the character's determination to seek a way out of every obstacle that arises (and there are many), is essential for the development of the narrative, since we can rarely predict the character's next steps. But if the entire cast has a great performance, the highlight is Frances McDormand, who gives enormous charisma and a disconcerting simplicity to Marge, a woman seven months pregnant who dedicates herself to her work and her family with the same intensity, calling her attention whenever she enters the scene thanks also to the great performance of the actress. It is she who calms the viewer with her simple reasoning and her direct way of solving problems, something that is clear, for example, in her visit to Jerry's office and in her conversation with an old college friend.Among so many great moments, it is worth highlighting the excellent kidnapping scene, in which we see Jean paralyzed in front of the image of the kidnapper looking into the house through the window. Notice how Joel conducts the scene with precision, investing in black humor to ease the tension - after all, only in a Coen film would a kidnapper calmly walk around the house looking for an ointment while the victim, after trying to hide, leaves wrapped in a curtain and hides. Crashes to the ground. Likewise, the way in which the big guy Grimsrud tries to disentangle himself from his partner's body in the third act is simultaneously comic and tragic. What is never tragic is the result of the work of the Coens, who, even when they don't get it right, manage to make great films. When they are inspired then, the result can only be spectacular, and this is what happens in ""Fargo"", a tense and fun film, which has a talented cast to become one of the best examples of what the Coens are capable of.The way the Coen brothers develop Fargo's story is wonderful. With mastery they manage to create chaos through a huge chain of lies, without making the story complicated or surreal. With a very well written script and great performances, they show how one lie leads to another until it turns into a huge snowball. In other words, they prove that if you're not a good liar, it's better to tell the truth soon because sooner or later you're going to fall.""Fargo"" is a work of impeccable script and unique execution that manages to create different reactions from the spectator, managing to bring him into the film, immersing him completely. His work with three parallel narratives guarantees a unique dynamic to the film, which is, at the same time, fast and slow without ever losing harmony. It definitely has enough material to be explored in the recent TV series adaptation, even if it's a risky bet. It is an unmissable film that leaves us wondering if those events really happened.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Internally Frayed,"The Coens are masters of the tease. By that I mean they'll find a closely embroidered dress and then goof with its perfection. They'll pull this and that element of the colored threads out so that its frayed, disturbing the scene so carefully constructed by the original craftswoman. Superficially it looks more homemade, more genuine this way. But if you look closely you'll see that what they've done is a matter of orchestrated destruction. Things defined by their distance from other things.Past that point it is merely a matter of whether the teasing engages or not.Their previous movie was not well received. The original garment was a combination of a mild Capra screwball and a 30's newspaper fold of a sassy woman detective. The noir mechanics were made explicit, as were the cinematic components.The audience  by this I mean the general paying audience  stayed away. They just weren't in the mood for clever deconstruction, no matter how polished.This is a reaction. Its a wonderful project, just wonderful in its way, but also sad in the implied tightness behind the decisions you see.What they've done is frayed the garment on the inside. Everything is sparse, bleak. All the camera setups are overly simplified, all the emotional mechanics understated. Most of it is buried in the snow.If this movie were made by anyone else, it would just be amusing, a calm sketch of a deliberately uncaffeinated selling itself as if it were a chain of simple products.But it isn't. Its a suppressed visit by extremists pretending to not be extreme. Its Lynch doing ""Straight Story"" and not asking us to know that over every dusk hued horizon is one of his ragged unreal movies.Because of this, we see small gateways into the world of the Dude, or the Sirens. The unborn child will enter a different world. The postage stamp will fly to a different world (when the rates change).Watch it for the simple garment, a dress covered by a coat. Watch it for the fraying and teasing on the inside, and imagine the colorful embroidery disturbed on the out.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Good flick - somewhat overhyped,"A planned kidnapping in snowy and somewhat sleepy Minnesota goes wrong. Jerry Lundegaard (William Macy), Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) and Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) are all three fantastic. All the characters exude a comedy and strangeness that you won't find in any other film. In a world where good (Marge Gunderson) and evil (Carl Showalter) can be clearly separated, the naive Jerry Lundegaard finds himself helplessly caught in the middle of the two forces.Despite everything, the film falls victim to its extreme hype. A good story, set against a great backdrop with unintentionally funny characters - but that's all it is for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Quirky characters, dark humor","A movie that's hard to categorize, because, quite frankly, it's so weird. It's innovative and artistic, with quirky characters and an offbeat approach.Dark humor can be difficult to digest sometimes, and that is my one major criticism of the film as several innocents suffer or even die violently. The movie doesn't seem to care, as it scurries along in an effort to showcase its weirdest characters. Sheriff Marge Gunderson (skillfully portrayed by Frances McDormond) is the only character who seems to notice that the victims are human beings. She's the protagonist with a calm demeanor and low key, Columbo style approach to the grisly crime she is investigating. She also serves symbolically as the only force of peace and sanity in this film's bizarre universe.In stark and comedic contrast to her are all the freaks. William H. Macy is brilliant as a car salesman who would try to sell an Eskimo an air conditioner. He hatches a foolhardy scheme involving two thugs to get some quick cash which starts to unravel. His efforts to keep on talking his way through everything reminds one of a guy trying to talk his way out of quicksand. His father-in-law is equally nutty; a zillionaire whose every conversation resembles a board-room style exec meeting with his ever-present business partner.The two crooks are just psychos, perhaps patterned after the two slime balls in ""In Cold Blood."" One is an idiot who never shuts up and errantly imagines he's the brains of the partnership; the other a mindless automaton who rarely speaks, but the wheels are always turning in his head. When he acts, he is devoid of any emotional response--just like a machine calculating, and reacting with ruthless efficiency.The actors work all of these over the top characters well, and the film delights in bouncing them off each other. The dark humor is at times brutal, but overall this movie is an entertaining watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Schmucks are funny,"Although ostensibly a crime thriller, Fargo is really a dark comedy and probably the best one ever. I love how this movie makes fun of midwestern culture and total schmucks like Jerry Lundegaard and Carl Showalter.Frances McDormand is the best actor of her generation and perhaps the most underrated. I think she doesn't get enough praise sometimes.The Coen Brothers have certainly crafted their best with Fargo. I think it's even better than No Country For Old Men or The Big Lebowski (two films I also love).Not too many films of more than one genre can be good let alone great.

Review of Fargo,"This was unbeliavably fun. I expected some kind of mystery or twist so i was ready to not like it, there's some exceptions but usually i dont like movies that rely on the plot twisting too much. They feel like the director doesn't do anything for 2 hours and then it just hits you and you have to act all surprised, pretend it's the greatest movie ever made. I enjoy movies that just pick up and go without any twists. I could not predict a single scene of this movie. It went in the completely opposite direction from my predictions. This is definetly a classic and one of the Coen's best movies. A really nice crime thriller that you can watch over and over again!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"The genius called ""Coen Bros""","Heard quite a lot about ""Coen Bros"" but never really got around to watch any of their body of work. When I watched ""Fargo"" today I was spellbound by the cinematic genius('es). Considering this movie is about 15-years old it would be an understatement to say that their writing and cinematic sensibilities is beyond expression.The characterisation of each actor leaves an impression. For instance unlike other movies in ""Fargo"" a cop is just not a character, he has a life too, a family and emotions. Unlike a cog-in-the-wheel the writing goes a bit deeper to flesh out the character more effectively thereby making them more true-to-life and connectable.Performance wise, as stated earlier every character is a gem.۩ William Hacey:: The backbone of the plot and hence he ought to have delivered good in good condition. He delivers to the utmost perfection. Perhaps the best in his career.۩ Steve Buscemi:: A hidden gem then as opposed to now. And his spark showed way back then. A very natural and gifted actor.۩ Frances McDormand:: She literally gets into the skin of the Marge.۩ Harve Presnell:: very regal and assertive performance.The dark humour is plenty and slightly shocking, which is kind of expected. The background music is paced well with the narrative and does linger in the head for a while.Watch it once and you can be absolutely certain to come back and relish the characters all over again.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Greed at its finest,"Honestly, an ordinary movie, with a simple story.

"Good Movie, Can't Figure Out the High Ratings",This was a pretty solid film from the Coen brothers but I can't figure out why it's such a highly rated movie. The acting is fantastic in this one; they capture the upper Midwest so well in each scene. I also appreciate the tremendous cinematography that the Coen brothers are consistent within their direction. Scenes like the kitchen where they can capture the husband at the table with the wife struggling to start the car are just a little attention to detail that they do so well in their films. But maybe this film hasn't aged as well. It might have been such a unique and cool concept in the 90s but I don't know what makes this movie so special and reading other reviews doesn't explain it either. I'm glad I watched it but it didn't hit high marks for me and I'll probably pass on a rewatch. 3.5/5 stars.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Hyped to death and a big let down for me,"I love most coen brothers films but even the ones I love have that one awful part to them, the supernatural unexplained arty farty scenes (The biker in raising arizona, the devil & the flood in oh brother, the ufo in the man who wasn't there, etc) I find them to be the low points in every one of their films. Fargo either missed that obstacle or the entire film consisted of a variation of it, either way it failed me from the first 5 minutes I was unhappy with this film. Just stripped down simple times in a simple place with complicated deadly themes. Disregard the value of life and be entertained. Art? yes lots of art, if you want to think it's there.. This movie should not have been the staple for the Coen brothers, people hold this movie in such high regard it just makes me think they are just wanting to sound smart because they only had to watch it twice to understand it. That and Wood chipper wood chipper wood chipper.. Yes I always hear the talk about the wood chipper scene, over & over, maybe the highlight of the film? wow.. so sad..

"Great thriller, even better because it's humorous","If you are annoyed by the word, ""yeah"" then this is not the movie for you. With that said, this movie is freakin awesome. It's great plot and storyline along with amazing performances by Steve Buscemi and Frances McDormand and it's a great thriller. William H. Macy is also really good. It shows how a small, petty crime turns into six people dying and two people being arrested. Some of it maybe be confusing, but it's still a great thriller. To add on to that, I thought it was pretty funny too. To wrap it up, I wouldn't suggest this to anyone younger than fourteen or fifteen, because you see people having sex and it drops the ""F"" bomb a lot. Also some mild violence, but still a great movie. 9.5/10. For Fans Of: THE USUAL SUSPECTS OR ANY COEN BROTHERS MOVIES",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Satirical thriller with atmosphere,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)Fargo is the kind of movie that appeals to people who have seen a lot of movies because everything is surprising and unexpected. The cop's a woman (Frances McDormand). Pregnant. The perps are psychos of course, but there are three of them and each is a different breed of psycho. William H. Macy is a car salesman who dreams up a scheme to cheat his rich father in law out of a million dollars by getting some degenerates to kidnap his wife. He's a white collar sociopath who always lies whenever his lips are moving unless there is some very good reason to tell the truth. One of the degenerates is a big silent guy (Peter Stormare) who kills people as one squishes bugs. The other (Steve Buscemi) is an ugly little bantam who lies and cheats and kills and steals and whines until finally somebody puts him out of his misery.This is Fargo, North Dakota, where people are country and it's cold and not very sophisticated. The movie makes gentle fun of the locals while guiding us to identify with them. McDormand eats a whole lot of Hardee's and Arby's and greasy dishes from the cafeteria piled high on her plate. She's eating for two. She loves her husband and he loves her. They lie in bed at night and watch TV. She's the police chief. She meets an old admirer in the big city. He's Asian. She is just curious. He is desperate. She has a self-effacing, aw-sucks, I'm not too bright (but I really am) style reminiscent of Tyne Daly in TV's ""Cagey and Lacy"" from some years back. Her husband Norm is a big guy who cooks for her and is an artist who paints wildlife. One of his duck paintings becomes a postage stamp. They all say ""Yaw"" a lot.The forlorn cold and desolate landscape of North Dakota is a Americana locale not used cinematically since I don't know when-Clint Eastwood's High Plains Drifter (1973), I guess. The script and direction are tidy without being too flashy. Everything is designed to surprise or bemuse the audience. Even the accents. There is the requisite quota of bright red blood; plenty of bullets puncture flesh and split bone. There's some gutter sex and a few shocking sights (one of the perps stuffs the other into a wood chip machine). All in all it's a slick, carefully crafted thriller with an artistic veneer, nicely photographed. It's clear that Coen and Coen have watched the movies of Atom Egoyan, Gus Van Sant, David Lynch, Oliver Stone, etc., and here pay them the sincere compliment of imitation with variation-or is it the other way around?",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quite possibly one of the tn best films of all time...,"There are a great many reasons for the extraordinary success of ""Fargo."" One of the reasons is the uproar it caused upon release when nosy little reporters found out it was not really based on true events like the disclaimer says at the beginning of the film. Then there was the tragedy of the Japanese woman who went looking for the buried stash of money and froze to death. The press had, what movie characters always call, a ""field day"" with this story. They overlooked the fact that she had left behind a suicide note and was informed by police the story was false upon arrival in Minnesota, where she was picked up by a worried police officer. She had a death wish.And the other reason for success is, of course, because the movie is one of the best of all films--a true ""story"" if ever there was one. It's more than a scathing social satire, more than a dark comedy, more than a great drama with a fabulous story filled with irony and coincedences and morals and so on and so forth. It's more than a great movie. It's superb.Marge Gunderson has become a sort of cultural character. People quote her like the Terminator or Charles Foster Kane or George Bailey or Darth Vader. She's so famous that I do not think many people realize Marge essentially comes in around forty minutes into the 98-minute movie. Yet that's what people think of when they hear the word ""Fargo""--Marge Gunderson--and so it just shows what an impact a film like ""Fargo"" made. And not only impact, but the remembrance of characters we love to remember.Marge provides a sort of balance between the wild and the crazy. She is the moral character of the story who juggles the two and tries to keep them from falling. When the film starts to get violent or ironic Marge steps in to sort out the mess. The Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, obviously have a firm grasp on the actuality of storytelling as opposed to filmmakers who can simply put a story on screen--ignoring whether it provides any sort of actual storytelling at all.I think we all remember the first moment Marge wakes up in bed and receives the phone call. She drives out to the barren, frosty highway with a view of Minnesota that stretches for miles, and investigates the crime scene of a most brutal murder. Three people haev been murdered: A cop, and two passersby. The villain(s)? Unknown. (Regarding the killer: ""And by the size of his feet he looks like a big fella'!"")The murders were, of course, all coincedental, having to do with a simple yet oddly complex plot: Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) has debts he is unable to pay, so he hires two crooks, Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaeur (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife,  Jean (Kristin Rudrud). Unfortunately, their plan did not go to...er...plan, and they had to kill three people along the way.The point where Gauer shoots the police officer who has pulled the men over for not displaying the proper tags on their vehicle is funny. And yet when you really think about it, that scene shouldn't be funny at all. But it is. The Coen Brothers know how to make it funny. They are like experts of the dark humor--when Carl says, ""Whoa, Daddy!"" and has that speckle of blood on his face, I always burst out in laughter. It sounds sick, but strangely, it isn't.The dialogue in ""Fargo"" is just as excellent as the film's twisty little plot. Frances McDormand rightfully won an Oscar for her portrayal of Marge Gunderson. She speaks with the perfect accent of, what the Coen Brothers call, the language ""Minnesota Nice""--where people are always cheery, even when they're being mean. It's just something inbred into citizens of Minnesota. And even when the worst things are happening to characters, you're smiling, because who doesn't love to hear, ""Gee, golly, gee whiz,"" throughout a movie, and who doesn't think it's funny?""Fargo"" is the type of film you can watch over and over. Sometimes I think to myself that I'm just going to watch a scene or two, but as soon as the credits start the film has my interest and never lets go. It's the odd sort of delightful little film that keeps the viewer's interest for the first time up through the fiftieth time and beyond.The film's plot takes twist after twist and we can identify ever so much with the character of Jerry as all his well-thought-out plans go to waste, causing his debt to become even worse and his life even more ruined than it already is. Steve Buscemi, as Carl, is just as much a scene-stealer as Marge Gunderson (I love to type that name), and Jerry is just as much a lovable character as someone who hasn't hired two crooks to kidnap his wife. That's the secret to ""Fargo""--or at least part of the secret. We like the characters, simply because we know they don't really mean any harm. Harm just happens to find them.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Abiding in the world of Craving and Delusion,"Blood Simple introduced the combination of mood and noir karma from above, the key was in making the first long, the second precise.Arizona went two steps further, supplying the multitudinous desiring mind that makes reality bubble up, Ozzie and Harriet through HI's mind.Miller's Crossing tried to do both the karmic noir while toying with 'the world of the mind' in the forest. They made Barton Fink that film about the mind instead, in a most obvious way by that point, rooms mapping to mind, wallpaper coming unglued.So by the time the Coens made this, there was already a clear blueprint of inclinations. Once more a film noir about a schmuck whose desire makes the skies cave in on him. Once more about the life of the mind, the mind dictating egoistic desire and greed, less obvious than Barton. Along the way we get their quirky staples, dry gaffe, guns, blood, a satchel of money, to offset the frigid pace in the broad audience's mind.But although Macy's desire makes all sorts of accident and chaotic whimsy bubble up in the world, a softly maintained order straight from Frances' calm Minnesotan mind prevails. The film offers in fact a perfectly centered metaphor of the Coens at work and their larger blueprint. It's a cold world out there, with human ego and desire creating inane anxieties, but it hasn't numbed the heroine's soul who calmly goes through a narrative, piecing it together, much like the Coens piece theirs.And from Frances' point of view, this to save a mirrored wife from danger and restore order in the world of the film.It's fine work to see on your first rounds. Methodical, exact, clean, some of the cleanest work you'll see anywhere.But clean logic comes with a tradeoff in unfettered intuition that can slip ahead of you into places you didn't know or can't quite explain. It takes a parting of this logic to give me the great stuff that go beyond story and ideas; Lynch's whole career has been a creative journey of this. I miss this here. Still, the entry points are there to see and imagine from. The kidnapping plot as a thought that wafts from his mind before he could keep hold of it, herself woken up in the middle of the night by nightmare.The Coens must have been aware of this fettering. They would drop a bomb on the logical mind with their next one.Noir Meter: 3/4 / Neo-noir or post noir? Neo",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Sarcasm and irreverence.,"""Fargo"" is a good movie, I confess that my experience with the movie was impaired because I watched the great series ""Fargo"" first, which contains a similar plot, but much better detailed and developed, because it is a series, so I watching the film compared to the series, and missed the further development of the characters, then the script to me, was not suppressed, on the contrary, I even I was disappointed a little (save dialogs), the soundtrack is good, photography the film is great, the acting is good, mainly from Frances McDormand, the way the situation is getting worse more is comical, his black mood is very good, violence is sarcastic, the great dialogues, the Coen brothers are masters in this type of humor, and use a lot of visual to help build all the comic climate / tragic film.

If Fargo had been made after A Simple Plan, I would have said cliché or an imitation, but I can say that it was a pioneer. This is a crime movie, a bag full of money, two killers, a female cop and misfortunes. As said, a good movie, but no more than that. This is the problem. It is seen as one of the best movies of 1990s, some say it is the best Coen Brothers movie by far! Almost every Coen movie is compared with Fargo, so found disappointing, critics say that it was a masterpiece. This is the problem. The movie is good, but there is nothing that great in the movie. By the way, Fargo is not flawed, but I did not like the end. It was raw and too simple for such a movie. Honestly, I liked A Simple Plan more, even if it was inspired by Fargo and made later.

"Even though it's serious, it's just so darn funny!","This is a strange film.  Most of the time, when it comes to films that are reality based, I get tired of them real fast.  Take a film like Affliction. That film was about an alcoholic father and the abuse of his sons.  It got real old real fast because there was just too much reality in there.  And it didn't manage to mesh the reality with even a modicum of entertainment. Fargo is different.  This is a very serious film with a whole slew of funny moments.  I don't think I have laughed this hard in a film when people weren't doing anything particularly funny.  But when a guy with a shovel in his hand tells you than there are clouds coming in over the horizon, and you find that gut-splittingly funny, then you are in for a special film.  Fargo is that film.But besides the hilarity, what makes this film work is the breakthrough performance of William H. Macy.  Macy plays Jerry Lundergard the only way he should be played.  Lundergard is a troubled man.  He is in some financial difficulty and he has rich relatives that wouldn't give him any money for any reason.  They don't particularly like him.  Lundergard is a normal man. He comes from a small town and he ends up hatching a big scheme to get the money.  He will have his wife kidnapped and then set up a ransom for her that will go to him.  His wife won't be harmed and then he can pay off his financial debt.  So he hires a couple of idiots, violent idiots, but idiots nonetheless.  Of course this being a crime movie, and a Coen crime movie at that, everything is going to go wrong.  And it does.Macy captures the true feel of what it would be like to be in Lundergard's position.  He is nervous.  He is nervous because he is so inept at crime that he hasn't even bothered to get the kidnappers phone numbers and he tried to supply them with a car by smudging some numbers when sending in a fax to GM.  In one of the best scenes in the film, what starts out as a friendly meeting between Marge, the police detective, and Jerry turns into disaster for Jerry.  He can't even lie well enough to a police officer who really isn't questioning him about the crime, just the possibility that the crooks stole a car from his lot.  Now I'm no expert in kidnapping, but wouldn't it have been better for him to just say that he had a car stolen from the lot?  But he can't even figure that out properly.Marge is played by Academy Award winner Frances McDormand.  She is from the small town of Fargo, she is pregnant and she has trouble starting her car in the morning.  But she is also a gifted police officer.  Upon investigating the scene of the first crime, she figures it out with common sense and logic.  "" I don't think I agree with some of your police work there..."" she tells the other officer that seems to have it all backwards.  When she gets to the big city, the first thing she does is look for a buffet, then she goes onto trying to solve a crime.  She still has her priorities straight.The two kidnappers are played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare.  Buscemi is Showalter and Stormare is Grimsrud and they couldn't be more opposite. Buscemi is ""funny looking"" and a nervous, talkative fellow while Stormare is a quiet, almost dumb looking dork.  But they are ruthlessly violent and quick to pull the trigger.  Buscemi provides the film with some of the bigger laughs as his character is always described as being funny looking by the locals.The Coens have made some movies that were considered good, although not my taste ( Miller's Crossing, Barton Fink ) but Fargo is a step above most other films.  It is smarter than any film should be and it is honest and deceptively funny.  If something is supposed to go wrong then it does.  In most films, when a crime is committed, the only reason it is solved and the good guys win is because that is the way scripts are written.  The good guys have to win because that is the formula for a film.  But in Fargo, everything that happens does so because there are reasons for it and reasons given for it.  If Marge is going to figure out the crime, she does so because she has done her homework and found out where the bad guys are. The script doesn't let her down.Fargo was one of the best films to come out of 1996 and it sure as hell was much better than English Patient.  I don't think we are meant to figure out the academy though.  One year it gives out best picture to a worthy film like Titanic and overlooks unworthy opponents like L.A. Confidential and then other years it gives best picture to crap like Shakespeare In Love and English Patient overlooking films like Saving Private Ryan and Fargo. Fargo is one of the most original films ever made and it is a perfect one to watch when you are tired of the formula that Hollywood releases time and time again.10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Illuminating and awakening in every sense,"This is my first review about a movie which is not in my mother language and I chose this movie specifically because although I like many Coen brothers' movies, this film will be in my heart in its special place, kind of forever.This is a black comedy crime movie but even in its gory scenes, the humanitarian perspective intelligently mixed with unnerving humor has never lost on you. This movie is an excellent example of what we should know and learn further about crime world and what individual ethics mean in every way we could comprehend. In all the characters, we can observe what is right and wrong and why they choose the paths they choose and what makes a human being a good person or evil. It is kind of a moral teaching session.The excellent acting and the script carry you from the first moment to the final moment of this film. The whole movie, even in its dark moments flows like a river and you forget the minutes pass. You can also see that the actors disappear in their performances and you cannot even say they are acting even though you know because they seem to you as if they were the real people and you were watching a horribly dark story in actual life from the first row alive. I especially fell in love with Frances McDormand's superb acting skills in this masterpiece, as I should call it since Coen Brothers' directing is peerless as well.The plot seems quite ordinary yet it reveals itself in no time with unexpected twists and turns throughout until you start to predict the next moves and fail each and every time. It is difficult not to empathize with each and every character and ask ""what would I do if I were in their shoes?"". The answers are always undetermined as they depend on your own character, even your mood and that's the beauty and the sincerity of this art work.The scenes, especially the ones with the plain snow are fascinating and resonating for sure and also those are sort of etched in one's mind.Also special kudos to William Macy, as a master in acting as he will always be. I am always a huge fan of him but in Fargo, he is excellent. And of course, Buscemi is fantastic as usual.All in all, this movie is a timeless classic and a never to miss. It is such a movie that you can enjoy any time you watch and as if the first time no matter how many times you have already watched it. In my opinion, every real film lover should be thankful to Coen Brothers and all of the cast and crew for making such an unforgettable treat for us and I am definitely lucky to know this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Brutal, tense and hilarious!","Fargo is a 1996 black comedy/crime drama film directed by Ethan and Joel Coen (The Coen Brothers) and stars William H. Macy, Frances McDormand and Steve Buscemi. Often seen as the film that launched the Coen Brothers successful career, Fargo without a doubt deserves all the credit it receives. The story focuses around a spineless, nervous car salesman who arranges for his wife to be kidnapped and held for a ransom of $80,000 to extort from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, in his desperation for money to repay an outstanding loan. Which ends up going horrifically wrong resulting in a series of grizzly murders. Fargo fantastically blends its sharp wit of dry humour and black comedy with its gruesome, thrilling and intriguing narrative, the two seem to go hand-in-hand perfectly with Fargo having scenes that will have you bursting out laughing and others on the edge of your seat. Fargo also features beautiful cinematography with wide, expansive shots of snow covered landscapes as well as a fitting dark and unsettling soundtrack. Each actor/actress completely owns their character making their motivations and actions clear, as well as relatable. Fargo has but a few nit-picking flaws, such as a particular scene which seems unnecessary to the advancement of the plot and feels out of place, in which Frances McDormand's character meets an old friend. Another is a plot-line which focused around Peter Stormare's character Gaear Grimsrud- not enough of the story was focused around his role as it should or could have been, also another flaw being the slight overuse of the word 'ya'. Overall, Fargo is a phenomenal film, both winning 2 well deserved Oscar's and launching the Coen Brothers career onto a new level, proving they are two of the greatest filmmakers of the modern film era. Not forgetting notifying the world of the traditional (and comedic) Minnesotan accent. Fargo is hilarious, violent, tense and intriguing. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Super film with a super lady (spoilers),"It's well known now that Fargo, contrary to the titles at the start, isn't based on a true story. It was just a little dig, a little joke at the expense of the 'true story' phenomenon. But at the same time it was a calculated move to get the audience to go with the story, because if the audience is told that something is true they're more likely to allow themselves to be swept up by it and believe in it. And I guess for some people Fargo may seem a little weird (well, to people who have been weaned on blockbusters). Therefore the true story tag was there to help make the plot seem more plausible.But, really, the film didn't need it. The film only seems odd in that the characters speak like real people, with all the broken sentences and 'ums' and 'ahs' (and 'yahs'), and act like real people  some act with nobility, others are completely feckless and some are violent. It also seems unusual because we're used to films where people speak perfectly, think perfectly and act perfectly. So, therefore, most audiences are used to a Hollywood unreality, which is why Fargo was such a breath of fresh air all those years backWhat I enjoy most about Fargo is Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy). He's such an idiot, a real putz ('What the heck d'ya mean?'). Yet despite the fact that he's stupid, and despite the fact that he has his own wife kidnapped for money, I can't help but kind of feel sorry for the guy. And I sort of feel sorry for him because he's human. He's embarrassed when he's asked why he needs the money; he's awkward when he's telling his son that something has happened to his mother; he gets angry when his plans fall through; and he loses his rag when the police finally catch on to him. Yet even then he desperately tries to maintain his dignity. He never reveals his true feelings. ('I answered the darn I'm co-operating here.') And I also like the fact that he always tries to overcome the new problems that he faces. He never quits. The funniest example is the way that he drives off halfway through a police interview. It kind of reminds me of The Simpsons (the sound of rushing footsteps and then the screeching of tyres). But there's also his final scene where he tries to escape the police by climbing through a window. He's a pathetic guy but at least he seems real.But although Lundegaard is something of a sympathetic character, he's also the most unforgivable. I mean, Steve Buscemi's character and Peter Stormare's character are just plain ruthless. They're greedy, immoral people and that's that. But Lundergaard is a family man with responsibilities and people who are dependant on him. Therefore, although he doesn't kill anyone, his actions are the most heinous.But speaking of Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, they're absolutely fantastic in this film. At first they kind of seem like a buffoonish odd couple, but because you've bought into their weird relationship with its amusing eccentricities (I love the pancake conversation), it makes the violence all the more shocking. These aren't cackling villains or loud-mouthed bad guys; they're the sort of psychopathic people you could meet in a bar or on the street. And as a consequence they're more interesting to watch. I especially like the scene where Buscemi is trying to get Stormare to talk. Even kidnappers need conversation. But I also like the scene with the state trooper. It's the scene where the fun and games stop. You really know what these characters are capable of. And the coldly efficient killings that follow are brutal in how simply they're directed. Too often directors try and tell you how to feel. The Coens just show it, and it's a technique that, for me, is far more effective.Another thing that the Coens show are the Minnesota people. Having never been there I have no idea whether the accent is accurate, but it's an interesting portrait of a society. Everyone is so damn polite. Even when a parking attendant is getting threatened he's still got a big smile on his face. And there's one guy who, matter of factly, tells how Buscemi's character threatened him. It's a great scene because it captures the way that people tell stories  kind of flatly and with little creativity. And at the end they talk about the weather. Brilliant. But setting the story in Minnesota was a great decision because polite societies are often the most violent  just take Victorian England. Everything gets repressed and it ends up bursting. Plus the snow and the pure white landscape hint at something dark under the surface.However, what lingers most in the memory is the character of Marge. She's the film's moral centre. She's the one who sees through the insanity of what's happening and the one that gives you hope for the future. Indeed, Marge and Norm are comforting figures. They have a relationship that is without mystery but one that is rock solid. They give you hope that sanity will prevail. And I like Marge's scene with the frighteningly needy Mike. ('You're such a super lady and I'm so lonely.') Even in the face of such pent-up madness she keeps her dignity and her composure. She really is a super lady.And Fargo is a super film. I'm not sure I'd put it on a par with The Big Lebowski and it's a bit too thin to be truly great, but it's certainly an excellent piece of cinema.Oh, but I've also got to mention one of my favourite lines in film. When Buscemi is talking to an escort he says, 'Find that work interesting, do you?' The woman's reaction is priceless.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Blood has been shed, Jerry.""","It's probably inevitable that, after hearing so much about its greatness, 'Fargo' proves something of a minor disappointment. After numerous critical successes {including their finest film to date, 'Miller's Crossing (1990)' and the Palme d'Or-winning 'Barton Fink (1991)'}, Joel and Ethan Coen apparently struck gold with 'Fargo (1996),' the ""true story"" of a kidnapping and murder in the icy wastelands of Minnesota. The film is a thematic retread of the brothers' debut picture, 'Blood Simple (1984)' {of which I was not overly-fond}, and explores how a seemingly-simple crime can escalate into the tragic and devastating destruction of innocent (and not-so-innocent) lives. The Coens would return once again to this popular theme with the accomplished film-noir, 'The Man Who Wasn't There (2001),' which is arguably one of their best efforts. 'Fargo' was the filmmakers' first real Oscar success, retrieving seven Academy Award nominations and two wins (Best Writing and Best Actress in a Leading Role {Francis McDormand}). However, the film's Best Picture chances were upset by Anthony Minghella's majestic wartime romance epic, 'The English Patient.'In a dreary small-town region of the United States, where the road is perpetually covered in frost and a sheet of ice affixes itself to your car windscreen, money-troubled father Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) plots a simple, fool-proof method of acquiring funds. He hires two dubious-looking thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife (Kristin Rudrüd), in order to extort ransom money from his wealthy, domineering father-in-law (Wade Gustafson). However, things don't go quite to plan, and after the two low-life criminals murder a state trooper and two passing witnesses, local Brainerd Chief of Police Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) arrives to investigate. She, like almost every other character in the film, has the jovial disposition and exaggerated mannerisms of typical Midwestern small-town folk, discussing a triple-homicide as though somebody has just stolen a cookie from the jar, and making frequent use of such quaint phrases as ""You betcha,"" ""Aw Jeez,"" ""Okie-Dokie"" and ""Yah.""The Coens have done a lot right with 'Fargo.' Their decision to blend a thrilling tale of deceit and murder with moments of satirical  almost slapstick  comedy creates a unique and interesting contrast that sets the film apart from most thrillers. William H. Macy is at his jittery best as a potential con-man so hopelessly inept that he can't call off the dangerous ruse because he never acquired the kidnappers' phone number. Steve Buscemi is, likewise, fantastic as Carl Showalter, a ""funny-looking"" weasel with a hot temper. Peter Stormare is suitably psychotic as the sullen but dangerous Gaear Grimsrud, even if his role just required him to remain silent and look creepy. Then we come to Frances McDormand (a.k.a. Mrs. Joel Coen), who, regardless of her talents as an actress, has annoyed me in every film in which I've seen her {which basically just covers 'Blood Simple,' 'Fargo' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There,' though to a lesser extent in the latter}.I know that Marge Gunderson is supposed to be one of the Coen Brothers' most entertaining creations, but her character somehow seemed so pointless. We spend all our time following her lightweight attempts at an investigation, and yet all I cared about was the kidnapping and how Jerry was coping with it all. Perhaps to hide the fact that Marge has almost nothing to do, the Coens toss in a couple of extraneous, dead-end minor characters who serve no purpose other than to distract me from the more exciting segments of the story. All things considered, 'Fargo' is a solid, albeit flawed, thriller/comedy that is characteristic of the Coens in every respect. Allow me to reiterate that William H. Macy was absolutely phenomenal, and definitely gives the film's greatest performance, though I did think that his character gave himself away too easily. In the grand scheme of things, 'Fargo' could certainly scrape into the directors' top five films, though my hope is that their latest release, 'No Country For Old Men (2007),' will oust it from the list.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"An interesting look at mannerisms and speech in Fargo, North Dakota but will it be memorable 20 years from now?","The first time I saw Fargo in 1996 I enjoyed it mainly because I was hoping that it would edge out the highly over-rated snorefest The English Patient at the Academy Awards.  Now I'm aware of the fact that Fargo is also highly over-rated.  Three generations of my family grew up in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota.  The mannerisms and speech used by William H Macy and Frances McDormand is realistic but why should I remember this screenplay twenty years from now?  Apparently it is a true story which must have all the fans of Survivor running for their local Blockbuster stores along with the fans of America's Most Wanted and Cops.  When I want to see reality that will impact me for years to come I'll rent something historically significant like Malcolm X or a documentary film like No Man's Land or One Day in September.  These movies are by the books as reality movies should be and don't look for black comedy that offends the memories of the people who were most closely affected by the tragedy.I did appreciate the effort on the part of the Coen brothers to add their usual wit to the mix.  William H Macy was hilarious as the father and husband who was more worried about money than about the lives of his family. It was a somewhat enchanting experience to watch him try to keep everything under control while slightly breaking down with every passing moment. Frances McDormand has proven herself to be talented in Almost Famous and The Man who Wasn't There but she is highly over-rated here.  Perhaps it's my bias that was putting all bets on Emily Watson's extraordinary performance in Breaking the Waves for the Academy Award.  For me McDormand was adequate and appeared to be having fun but not memorable 20 years down the road.  The always reliable Steve Buscemi (he should have won for Ghost World) stole the show here.Fargo is a film that I'd recommend to the reality-television audience and to serious fans of the Coen brothers films.  It enchants on some level but may disgust some viewers who will be perplexed that this really did happen. It suffices as a rental on a Saturday night when you want to see what all the fuss is about.  Be prepared however, if your from Fargo or Minnesota to be somewhat offended.  After all, when you see Frances McDormand, you'll be looking in the mirror.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I could watch this film several times and never grow tired of it. It's a true classic!,"The five (5) stars Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi, William H. Macy, Peter Stormare, and Harve Presnell in the order listed made this a spectacular film, but without the Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel as the triple threats that they are in writing, producing and directing this dark comedy/crime film it would not have been as memorable a film that it has become.So good is this simple story line that has been repeated hundreds of times before and after this 1996 rendition of a kidnapping gone wrong but somehow the combination of these five (5) top actors quirky midwestern accents, and mannerisms, and the superb cinematography and scenes developed by the two (2) Coen brothers makes this film a classic that will surely stand the test of time and grow in stature as each decade passes us by.I would rate this film certainly in the realm of the top 100 films of the 21st century. I give it a highly rated and deserving 9 out of 10 IMDB rating. Mrs. Shullivan also agrees with my evaluation and the 2014 TV spinoff series is a deserving homage to this 1996 film classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

So it needs something else which apparently this movie has, but as someone who just purely wants to be entertained and left thinking ""wow"", I was let down. Nothing shocked me, the ending didn't give me goosebumps etc. There were scenes (such as the one where the female cop talks to her old Asian friend from school) that I can't for the life of me work out why they needed to be there.So if you've been to film school or just simply have good knowledge of how a movie should be then by all means check this out and enjoy, but otherwise I recommend you stay away.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Probably The Best Dark Comedy Ever Made.,"Aside from Tarantino movies, which happen to have comedic elements, this is the best dark comedy I've seen and the highest rated one on many sites. At first, I didn't see what was so great about this like the way Roger Ebert raved about it. The whole movie is funny from the overly- polite midwestern accents. Reminded me of Canadian accents. But I did not find it to be a masterpiece. Then I tried really watching it, and I never looked back.The film is about a used car salesman named Jerry Lundengaard (Macy) who rigs his wife being kidnapped by two criminals be doesn't know (Buscemi, Stormare) as ransom so he can get needed money from his father-in-law (Presnell) he knows he would not get any other way. The kidnapping leads to three homicides where pregnant cop, Marge (McDormand) does some investigation and is soon hot on all their trails.In the first 20 minutes or so, we meet Jerry then witness the kidnapping and the murders. This start has always been exciting. Then we meet Marge and the story really starts to unfold as she does some detective work and Jerry gets what's coming to him. For some reason, the movie lost my interest when we meet Marge. After we meet her I became more interested with just hearing the people say ""yeah!"" and ""you betcha!"" After not watching the movie for a while, I tried really watching it and I finally understood what all the commotion was all about. The story is the one of the most original you'll ever see. Originality is what makes movies great and this has it. What makes the story and events original are the characters. All characters, even bad, are lovable and well-developed, the whole movie is exciting with character-driven twists that add sheer excitement, great morals and some nice filming techniques, all while keeping funny accents with humour so dark that it messes with you. There's nothing not to like. Jerry is probably the antagonist and villain since he was the brains behind ransom and started the chain of events. He is developed so well and there is so much sympathy created for him that the viewer feels sorry for him anytime he is brought down or is seen through. He never gives up and is greatly determined. Marge, the protagonist and hero, is the most original female hero ever. She is as awesome as The Bride in the Kill Bill movies. Nobody wants to see Marge nab Jerry. Steve Buscemi is like a creature that eats away at his boss's enemy. Stormare is kick-ass psycho that plays by his own rules and answers to nobody. Both of them are funny together because they are totally different: a chatterbox and a mute. These, as well as the other characters, are so real and well-developed that they drive the movie. A pure, original character driven story and important morals that arise are Shakespeare-like. Add great filming, odd humour and thrills, you get one of America's best films ever.4/4",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
When ordinary people meets the criminal world.,"This slow-paced movie is really surprising in the way that it put an effort to show how things can go wrong when stupid, unexperienced people are tumbling in crime world.

One of the other feeling that transmit this movie is that everything that is happening looks so normal that it creates a strange atmosphere, burlesque,

I want to talk about what the movie is about, but I'm not even sure if words could describe this story. It's very disturbing, this was not meant for children in any way. I know this sounds silly, but before the kidnapping of the wife, for a few minutes I thought it was actually a comedy. While even after that and a few disturbing scenes, you still laugh. It's a very dark comedy with very dark drama.I would recommend this movie, but not for the faint of heart. It's a little too much to handle if you can't stand gore.

My favorite Coen Brother film,"Fargo is about how far Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) will go to get some money and how out of control the situation becomes. The film follows pregnant chief police Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) as she tries to piece it all together. Frances McDormand gives a wonderful, Oscar winning performance as the multi-layered police chief. On the outside she has a comical personality, but she is also deeply caring. The movie is rounded together with fantastic performances from Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare, and William H. Macy.
 
The movie is beautifully shot by Roger Deakins, earning him his second Oscar nomination. The greatest aspect of the film is how the Coen brother's combated the barren landscape with dark comedy. The mixture of irony, awkward moments, and laughing at inappropriate times really make this film enjoyable to watch and a great film over all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Where is Pancakes House?,"One of my favorite movies by the Coen brothers. The writing and directing is absolutely amazing. Love this style of black comedy - very unique, but it never takes you out of the movie. Cinematography is done by the legendary Roger Deakins. Casting is also spot on. Watch this movie for acting alone and you won't be disappointed. Frances McDormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi all give memorable performances. But even the smaller characters are brilliantly acted. Peter Stormare and John Carroll Lynch are the best examples.Just sit back and let the story suck you in to the wonderful world of crime, drama and laughter - Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fargo,"Fargo is one of those films that I have always known about and heard nothing but great things of. Yet, for some inexplicable reason, I had never seen it, until now, of course. What's more, the two other Coen films that I have seen, No Country for Old Men and The Big Lebowski, were both fantastic. So, while I'm a little mad that it took me this long to get around to Fargo, I'm glad that I've finally seen it.Interestingly, despite its critical acclaim and popularity, I had no idea what this film was about. And I'm glad that that was the case. I believe that Fargo benefits greatly, from being experienced without any prior knowledge. It gives the film a chance to create the narrative and expectations, which turns out to be quite important considering how simple it ultimately is. And while the story and the characters are relatively simple, it's that simplicity, I believe, that makes this film as fantastic as it is. It gives the chance to really focus on the characters and their personalities and what drives them. Because at the end of the day, this film is all about the characters. They make Fargo enjoyable and entertaining and easy to fall in to. The main characters, which there aren't many of, are all distinctly different, but together, they end up creating such a complete and perfect end product, that it's hard not to enjoy it.The story is certainly another highpoint, not that there are really any low points. It follows Jerry, a car salesman, who is under a debt burden. To get out of the pinch, he devises a plan to have his wife kidnapped, and for his father-in-law to pay the ransom. However, as the plan starts going sideways and bodies start dropping, Marge, the head of police, is called in. As Jerry and the bad guys start feeling the heat, it's clear that the plan will never work, and they must all hope to getaway.
The story ends up sounding far more complicated than it is when written out. Indeed, when watching the final product, it's especially the story that amazed me with its simplicity. But there is also a certain simplicity associated with the characters. All of them tend to follow a clear personality type, be it jumpy and uncertain, short-tempered and assertive, or calm and trusting. And apart from Marge, none of the characters goes through a phase of self-discovery or change. From the very first scene of each character, it's easy to understand who they are. And as the movie progresses, it's easy to predict how they are going to act. While that may, at first, sound like a bad thing, in the case of Fargo, it becomes the opposite. To keep the story concise and enjoyable, there needs to be a certain degree of predictability, and Fargo captures that balance perfectly.Although I have already discussed the characters, there is one that I have yet to touch upon. That character, who is omnipresent throughout, is, of course, the dialogue and the accents it is delivered with. A lot of the novelty, as well as the fun, comes from the way conversations flow, as well as the mannerisms and sayings that the characters have. There is this certain friendliness, even in the most uncomfortable and frustrating conversations which gives the film an almost surreal feel. And although Fargo deals with some familiar themes and topics, thanks to its dialogue and environment it feels oddly otherworldly. It's something that I can't really explain, and I'm not even sure that those who have seen it would all agree, but the whole film felt close, yet simultaneously distant, which certainly added a lot to the overall feel.Having now finally seen Fargo, I'm tremendously happy that I did so. It most certainly lives up to all the praise it has received, and is, without a doubt, one of the most perfect films ever created. While it might not be a personal favourite, nor one that I look forward to revisiting as soon as I get the chance, what it is, is a tremendously enjoyable and entertaining experience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"I'm not gonna debate ya, this is a masterpiece","This is a real step up in film making for the Coens from all their previous works, to this, debatable their finest.Everything here is perfect from the pacing, the cinematography, the performances and script and the score.Marge's final few scenes encapsulate a wisdom and heartfelt frustration that is very moving and one i whole heartedly embrace.Gerry is such a loathsome, squirming, passive aggressive little rat that only the beautiful soul of Marge could be the anti-dote and she is in spades here.It's a grim tale told without any cynicism and a few wry laughs that we have come to expect from the brothers, mainly around the bugling kidnappers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Why did Macy character need the $?,"I love this film. One thing it never reveals is why the Macy character badly needed so much cash in the first place. First, this need for cash leads to the fraud with GMAC Financing (early in the film), but then, of course, it leads to the series of events in the main plot of the film.Anyone care to guess what the Macy character did to need so much cash, so quickly? We see no substance abuse or gambling tendencies. I'm stumped.One minor gripe with the film: the ""true story"" bit. It isn't. I don't understand why the Coens would feel the need to make that up, but they did.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Good Mix of Dark Comedy and Crime Drama,"""Fargo"" is a good movie, but not great. It has a unique mix of dark comedy and crime drama, which sets it apart from many other films. The story, centered around a botched kidnapping plot, is interesting and keeps you engaged. The cold, snowy setting of Minnesota adds a lot to the movie's atmosphere, making everything feel more intense.The performances are solid. Frances McDormand as Marge Gunderson is the standout. She brings a lot of warmth and quirkiness to her role as a pregnant police chief. William H. Macy also does a good job as the desperate car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard. The rest of the cast is decent, but these two really shine.One thing I liked about ""Fargo"" is its mix of humor and violence. The Coen Brothers did a good job balancing the two, making some scenes unexpectedly funny while others are quite brutal. The dialogue is sharp and often witty, which helps lighten the mood in a film that's otherwise pretty dark.However, there are some parts of the movie that drag a bit. Some scenes feel slow and don't add much to the overall plot. The pacing could have been tighter to keep the momentum going throughout the film. Also, while the quirky characters are fun, not all of them are memorable or fully fleshed out.Overall, ""Fargo"" is a good watch with strong performances and a unique style. It might not be everyone's cup of tea, especially if you're not into dark humor, but it's definitely worth seeing for the standout moments and the distinct Coen Brothers' touch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"An excellent film, although the comedy is so watered down and so sarcastic that it's not funny to most people.","When I saw this movie for the first time, a few years ago, I didn't understand it, and it annoyed me a lot. However, I've always heard good things about it, and after seeing several Cohen films that I liked, I realized the film's potential and decided to rewatch it. I did it at a good time: the film is better than I thought, and I just didn't know how to evaluate it as it deserved.The film begins with a note indicating that it is based on real events. It's a joke, actually, as it's entirely fictional. The story, however, can be based on several crimes, because it's nothing that we haven't seen on some TV news: a man who desperately needs money decides to hire two criminals and fake the kidnapping of his own wife, in order to convince his wealthy father-in-law to pay a fat ransom. It turns out that, as is so often the case in Cohen Brothers movies, things don't go as planned, the criminal duo's control gets out of hand and people start to die, as the local authorities, which practically boil down to a pregnant sheriff and a few colleagues, try to investigate what is going on.The film made a huge sensation among critics and at festivals. It was nominated for several Oscars, but only won two statuettes (Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress). It was also considered by many to be the best film by the Cohen Brothers, a highly relative consideration, which largely depends on the personal taste of the person who claims it. Anyway, it's a good movie, quite tense and dramatic, and where the comedy is in the brutally ironic way in which things happen.Frances McDormand is an actress who deserves particular attention in this film. She's not the kind of law enforcement officer we'd expect to see, because she appears to have a friendliness and sweetness that goes hand in hand with uncompromising law enforcement or even the use of firearms. However, her character does that and is actually very good at following her lead. Another actor to be congratulated is Steve Buscemi. He gives a huge performance, perhaps one of the best of his career so far. Next to him, Peter Stormare gives us the image of a cold and few-spoken criminal, who exerts brutal violence when he gets angry. William Macy is convincing in the role of the car salesman, with a slimy overdose of hypocritical politeness and cowardice.Technically, the film has excellent cinematography, where snow and gray tones are the dominant accent. Interestingly, it seems that a lot of artificial snow was used in the film in order to achieve the icy and inhospitable look that the directors wanted. The sets and costumes are very good, particularly McDormand's costume and her hairstyle. The film uses a lot of very good visual and special effects, particularly in the more violent scenes, like the one where the killer tries to tear his victim apart in a shredder. The soundtrack has one of the most interesting main themes in the Cohens' filmography.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
10/10,"SO well done. The casting is outstanding. Each actor has found the core of the character, that solid foundation from which everything else is built effortlessly. At least that's the way the actors make it seem. The performances are organic, spun from an organic thread that runs through the performances moment to moment, scene to scene, episode to episode. You never see the strings...There's Ben Wishaw's deadly serious and morally reborn Rabbi Milligan, who will kill without hesitation in defense of a higher ethic and code. And Salvatore Esposito's clownish and wildly dangerous Gaetano, a lover of opera and a complete psycho. Jessie Buckley kills as Nurse Mayflower, a a quirky Angel of Death. Buckley proves that killers CAN be fun-nee!Jason Schwartzman deserves an award, playing a mob boss like no other you've seen before. He shifts between ruthlessness and wit with ease, between boss and pretender in the blink of an eye, and somehow manages to convince us that he is the Top-Dog Italian in town despite that he looks like he more belongs behind the counter at the local Jewish deli. One great moment-to-moment choice after another. Brilliant casting choice.And then there is Chris Rock. Hard to buy in at first, cuz. ""It's Chris Rock!"" But with each episode, you buy in more and more. Head of the local Black crime family, the more ruthless he becomes, the better it gets. No trace of the funny man here. And that makes his performance all the more revelatory. I mean, who casts Rock as a mob boss, in a drama? Well, it worked!Direction is great, sound and lighting and all production values are high. And the writing is marvelous!Really good show, and too bad we can't binge and have to wait a week.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""Little things mean a lot...""","What I really love about this movie, as with all the Coens' movies, are the small eccentric touches.

But better still are the small roles: the irate customer (""These guys!  It's always more!""), Mr. Mohra (""..she says I should call it in, so I called it in.  End of story.""), Mike Yamagita (Steve Park from In Living Color!), etc.  And of course, Frances McDormand's very pregnant police chief with a mind like Sherlock Holmes is perhaps the most appealing character I've seen in any movie.Also, I love that haunting theme music.  There's so much more I could say about this movie, but it's probably already been said.   Destined to be a classic.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Home-spun, entertaining and unexpected but sometimes slow and meandering.","Built around a sweet, polite, small-town police officer and her attempts to solve a murderous mystery seemingly by being as nice as possible, this strangely pleasant yet decidedly dark tale is somewhat satirical and screams 'Coen' as soon as it starts, with a totally phoney 'based on a true story' title-card that's supposed to excuse some of the more extreme coincidences and absurd-isms found in the plot. 'Fargo (1996)' is an entertaining time that feels as home-spun as its supposed to, doesn't always take the expected route and focuses on fairly realistic characters who are mostly atypical of the usual archetypes found in this type of story, but it is also sometimes slow and meandering, too (which is actually Coen trademark). 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The Coen Brothers' masterpiece,"How do I even begin to review a film that has been in my personal Top Three of all time since the second I left the theater back in 1996? I guess that has always been one reason that I've avoided watching this film in the past year and a half that I have been reviewing every film that I see. The best thing to do, as I did with my other two favorites in my personal cinematic trinity, is describe why this movie is, in my opinion, incredible.'Fargo' is, like many Coen brothers films, the story of a stupid crime gone horribly wrong. In this case, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is in deep debt after committing some major fraud at his father-in-law's car dealership, so he comes up with a scheme to have his wife kidnapped in order for his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom. Unfortunately, the men he hires (Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi) are not only completely unstable, scary and share a half a brain among them, and what was supposed to be a simple kidnapping culminates in the murder of three innocent bystanders. Enter Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) a small-town sheriff, who also happens to be seven months pregnant, who steps in to try to solve the case.'Fargo' has so many things going for it: Phenomenal acting (McDormand won a well-deserved Oscar for her role) by all players, supporting and lead and a brilliant script that is part mystery, part thriller and part drama, and all layered in a thin veneer of some of the darkest comedy seen in recent years, are just two of the outstanding elements. The cinematography of 'Fargo' however is absolutely beautiful. The snow-white landscape is so stark and vast; yet suddenly you realize that you are watching a tiny figure in the distance, trudging through the snow; and it's one of the main characters. One shot in particular is so unbelievably framed, that for a good ten seconds, the viewer isn't entirely sure what they are looking at, until it becomes obvious that it is a deserted parking lot with one car parked in the middle of it. Scenes like these are literally breath-taking, and harkens back to some of the beautiful cinematography in one of their earlier films, 'Millers Crossing'.One of the funniest things I remember about this film was actually an unfavorable review my parents, who are both movie lovers themselves, gave it before I saw it for myself. It was, verbatim, 'We saw 'Fargo' and it was REALLY dark. We hated it. You will LOVE it.' And indeed I did. I walked out of the theater eight years ago on a cold, snowy night and literally thought to myself, 'THAT is how films should be made.'That really sums it all up in simple, non-flashy terms. And because of my very true adoration for their work, I have described how choosing my favorite Coen Brothers film is like a mother choosing her favorite child. It takes a film that is a step above 'phenomenal' in order for it to shine above all of the other fantastic films they have made. In my opinion, 'Fargo' is and always will be that caliber of film for me. Every other film of theirs have varying degrees of 'great-ness', because I truly love and admire all of their work, but because of its standout performances, intelligent and compelling script, and it's beautiful presentation, 'Fargo' is a four star film, and will always remain on my personal 'favorites' list.--Shelly",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A delightful deconstruction of film noir,The Coen brothers' early films are all variants-usually comedic-on film noir. This is the most successful of their early efforts. In some ways it is a rather blunt in how it turns the style inside out. I.e. The negative space of typical noir is made white by setting the story in Minnesota or how basically every character is dumber than a bag of rocks. The film is highly enjoyable because of this quality. And if nothing else the film is always amusing.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
a great American film,"This is without a doubt the most brilliant, creative, and stylish film I have ever seen. The coen's really out did themselves with this piece of work.

How this film did not win best picture of 1996 is beyond me, and it astonishes me that the Joel coen did not win best director for this. At least the academy recognized the great acting by Francis Mcdormand and the creative brilliance of the screenplay. William H. Macy also did a wonderful job although I believe they overlooked Steve Buscemi, who in my mind is the most underrated actor in Hollywood. But perhaps I am most impressed with the acting of Peter Stormare who portrayed an excellent cold-blooded character. Everything about this film is great.

The ""minnesota nice"" dialogue, always trying to deal with confrontation by being nice and friendly.The performances make it real, well deserved for Frances McDormand as Marge ""you betcha"" Gunderson. Buscemi is great as the bumbling thug. And Macy also is great as the salesmen hiring two men to kidnap his wife.The funny thing is though, it's not a true story.

As I was watching, I was looking forward to seeing how they would present these totally unique people to me and I was sorely disappointed.

"If anything can go wrong, it will...","Fargo is a movie that depicts the Murphy's Law in total ""If anything can go wrong, it will..."" Well in this movie it all went wrong.The movie states this is a true story, but that can be argued since the movie itself is completely fictional. The Coen brothers claim that many of the events that took place in the movie were actually based on true events from other cases that they threw together to make one story.The movie's radical turn of events is something that will catch the interest of any audience, as things just don't go as they should for anybody. The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, winning two for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress in a Leading Role for McDormand. It also won the BAFTA Award and the Award for Best Director for Joel Coen at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival. The movie plots have Frances McDormand starring as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief with a sharp and smart mind, who begins piecing together a case where a pair of motorists are found slain not far from the corpse of a state trooper.As Marge continues to put it all together, more people seem to be involved in the case than there should.On the other side of the events we have Jerry (William H. Macy) who has had his wife kidnapped so he can get the ransom money but everything just goes wrong.Kudos to the Coen brothers for a nice screenplay as everything that seems to happen on each shot complements the next, the characters are well depicted and the acting is a strong A+. The movie did have its faults, there were scenes that were totally unnecessary and a lot of people may complement the accents but I found it meaningless.Editing was top notch, directing to me was not so bad but won't award it. The story too had its lapse it took too long to pick up.Coen brothers are no stranger to the Academy awards, their 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou?

Triumph of parts over whole,"There are many incidental pleasures in ""Fargo"", but where's the structure? I recall reading a definition in one of those concepts-for-which-we-have-no-words dictionaries: ""a book in which everything is clear except the author's purpose in writing it"".  Here is the cinematic equivalent.For those who want to excuse the film's messiness as the result of being based on a true story ... well, guys, I don't know how to say this: it isn't.  That ""the events you are about to see"" opening statement is a simple lie.  They made it all up.  I don't know about you, but I'm not inclined to just shrug my shoulders and say, ""oh, well""; this is AT BEST the Coen brothers' shameful way of manipulating us into doing their work for them. They should use craft to make us accept their stories, not deceit.  No doubt they can pass it all off easily enough as a postmodern joke, but to tell the truth, I'd thought the Coen brothers were above postmodern jokes - and they are.  ""Barton Fink"" was one of the best films of the 1990s.  ""Fargo"", thanks to its shapelessness, fails to live up to the other three Coen works I've seen.  (In case you're interested, the remaining two are ""Miller's Crossing"" and ""The Hudsucker Proxy"".)And yet, and yet ... Particular plot elements, individual scenes, certain characters and aspects of people's characters, are so fascinating, so artfully drawn ... it's frustrating.  Lundegaard is a wonderful character. He's the kind of man who stumbles from one weak act to the next and would probably hate himself if he stopped to think about his actions at all.  It was very clever of the Coens to begin his story in the middle.  We're never told exactly what fraud he's trying to cover up by kidnapping his wife; but we know, we just KNOW, that he committed THAT to cover up some lesser fraud, and the lesser fraud was in turn a way of saving face after he'd done some other thing, and that when we trace the chain of events back to its source we'll find ... in all likelihood, nothing.  Marge Gunderson is also a wonderful character.  She's proof that someone can be deeply, deeply good without being dull, or getting on our nerves.  Take the superb scene where she meets her old school friend in a restaurant ... but I'm reminded of what's wrong with ""Fargo"", for what's THAT scene doing in THIS movie?  I can't make it out.  ""Fargo"" really baffles me.  So many good parts, a curiously unsatisfying whole; great throughout, good overall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Minnesota-NotSoNice,"Fargo is a film taking place in a town of the same name, in Minnesota. The story revolves around a car salesman that's in great debt, and thinks he knows the best way to take care of the matter, even if it backfires.An exceptional film that is widely considered as one of the best of all time. The Coens deliver their dark sense of humor and their own touch of drama, mystery and crime, in the eerie setting of the small town. An original crime story with quirky characters and a quirky plot, which at times may seem a bit over the top.All in all, a film that is definitely worth watching, even more than once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Another nice outing from the Coen brothers,"While I am not really a big fan of the Coen brothers I liked most of their movies I saw, the best being THE HUDSUCKER PROXY. Having heard for years about FARGO since they made also a TV show based on it, I knew that some day I would have seen it, and I did last March. Considering that to date there are 1,087 reviews I'll be short.Jerry Lundergaard (William Macy) is an idiot businessman that has some problems in money. For having more money he has a plan: to fake the kidnapping of his wife Jean so that his father in law is forced to pay the ransom. After the advice of a car repairman he goes to a bar in Fargo where he meets Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsud (Peter Stormare) and promises them to give a car and, give half of the ransom money to both of them. Carl and Gaear succedd but Jerry didn't considered that the two are idiots: while Carl drives the car with the hostage Gaear shoots a police officer and two that were witnesses to the scene. All goes unnoticed until Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) comes, and she takes the problem personally while she is also waiting a baby. There are lots of twists and turns, but it's best that you see them for yourselves.I liked the performances: William Macy is perfect for the role of the salesman that plots the kidnapping of his wife, and Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are great as his bumbling henchmen. And while Frances McDormand looks like a supporting character, she truly deserved her Academy Award for best Actress (see the ending and you'll understand what I mean). The setting was cool in a way, and the whole movie has some sort of nostalgic feeling from the 1990s that even folks who didn't lived there like me would have.In substance, FARGO stands to his reputation as a cult movie and it's certainly a must see. Just don't have too much expectations for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
How enjoyable!,"I've caught a glimpse of Fargo on TV and i decided not to watch it half way through but really enjoy it from beginning to the end. And i loved it. The most amazing thing here are the always lovable characters. You're gonna commiserate with those who are lost and find sympathy in those most crooked. They are all well casted, perfectly played and most importantly real. the dialogue is what keeps this movie witty till the end. The little exchange of words between the characters is amazingly written. what starts off as a well thought out plan spins out of control very quickly but it wont catch you off guard. its a movie definitely worth watching for all its traits- writing, directing, characters, dialogue, the cold scenery. its one of those movies that leave you with a feeling of time well spent and art very much enjoyably consumed.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A list of my favorite actors in a film that is both real and completely boring,"I understand the positive reviews, I really do. The story is non conventional, based on real events that lack the serendipity and skill of movie events. The actors, some of my favorites are in it, play very well. The mix of dread, disgust, contempt and amusement has a nice flavour, too. But the film is too real, too mundane and ultimately totally boring. It's like a heist movie done by idiots, but dangerous idiots at that.Bottom line: I really wanted to like this film, because they just released a series based on it. However, after watching it, I can't bring myself to view the series. The average grade that I give this film doesn't mean that I am indifferent to it, just that it kind of hits mediocrity, but that only because I average good acting and intriguing potential with my feeling of utter boredom after watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The true masterpiece of the Coen Bros.,"A lot of people consider No Country for Old Men to be the best effort from the Coens, and while that movie is A masterpiece, it doesn't really match the genius of Fargo.A lot of people forget that in 1996 the Coens weren't popularly successful. They'd had critical acclaim with Blood Simple, Raising Arizona and Barton Fink, but it was Fargo that truly put them on the map. And why not? Fargo is just about as perfect a film as you can find.The reason I consider this a step above No Country for Old Men is that Fargo offers pointed but not preachy philosophy about what truly matters in life and where genuine happiness comes from. No Country is brilliant, but it's also deeply nihilistic (which should come as no surprise, being based on a Cormac McCarthy novel).Everything about Fargo is top-class. The acting, the cinematography, and especially the writing. The entire cast gives career-best performances, Roger Deakins creates incredible visuals out of the Minnesotan winter, and the dialogue mixes tragedy and comedy so well that they're almost indistinguishable. And at the center of it all is France McDormand in her Oscar-winning portrayal of a brilliant police chief.The Coens have no shortage of classics, but this amazing film will always be my personal favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Maybe I just didn't get it,"I will acknowledge that Fargo is, technically at least, a fantastic film. The Coen brothers always deliver fantastically written, directed and shot pieces of cinema, but I just didn't enjoy this one very much. I think it maybe to do with the setting - I know nothing about, nor care for Dakota or its significance. Also the characters - they were mostly appealing, but I just couldn't get in to any of them. There's some wonderful black humour on display here, some suspense, and good characterisation. However I just feel as if I've seen all of this done better elsewhere in individual instances, and I certainly wouldn't compare this to No Country For Old Men, which I watched recently.If I want humour, I'll watch a comedy, if I want suspense I'll watch a thriller and if I want good writing I'll watch Oscar nominees. Though, to me, Fargo seems to be a diluted collaboration of elements that I've seen done better in their specific environment.All in all, I suppose I'd compare my viewing experience to one of someone who is told the twist before they've seen the film - one of the major aspects of enjoyment is ruined from the beginning, and I just really didn't like the setting or characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coens' Best,"I imagine popular opinion now holds that ""No Country for Old Men"" is the best Coen brothers movie ever made, but for me this 1996 crime thriller will live on as their masterpiece.The Coens have always had trouble integrating their warped sense of humor into their films, and too often they tip the balance over into the grotesque. But in ""Fargo,"" they for once strike the perfect balance between the macabre and the absurd, and though laughs abound, the film never lets us forget the seriousness at the film's center.The plot revolves around a money scheme gone badly awry, but the scheme itself doesn't matter. The Coens are more interested in watching what can happen to a bunch of ordinary Joes when money lust is involved. Anchoring the film with a beautiful performance is Frances McDormand as pregnant police officer Marge, whose country bumpkin accent and demeanor belies the sharp acuity of her investigative skills. The Coens are frequently mean and snide to their own characters, as if they're making movies about people who they feel superior to, but Marge is one of their most fully-realized and warmly human creations. She's the lioness protecting not only her cub but everyone else's cub as well, and the fact that she goes about her job with a smile and a friendly ""hello"" doesn't make her any less ferocious.I love the film's final scene, in which Marge and her husband watch the evening news, both without actually speaking the words asking the other just what kind of world they're bringing their unborn child into.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fargo,"Fargo is a curious wacky but dark crime thriller.The Coen Brothers build on their previous noir crime movies and play around with the conventions. They do this by imbuing it with some bizarro characters.Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is an executive car dealer with a rich father in law. He enlists two wacko hoods. The talkative Carl (Steve Buscemi) and the quieter Gaear (Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife.Jerry hopes to split the ransom money with the hoods but the plan goes awry. Carl and Gaear leave a trail of bodies behind.Heavily pregnant Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) investigates the murders. The victims includes a state trooper.There is little by way of background to the characters. Jerry seems to be running some kind of car scam, he is in debt and has a business investment where he wants his father in law to lend him some money. It is clear that nervy Jerry is way over his head with his mad bad plan.The snowy landscapes of Minneapolis, the mock Scandinavian accents all give the movie some distinction. Despite some humour which mainly comes from a cool kooky Marge. This is a misanthropic film.The dead bodies pile up and the killings become nastier as the movie goes on. It was an accomplished movie from the Coens who were still regarded as Independent filmmakers. It is just that Fargo is a difficult film to like.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A most outstanding movie,"Undoubtedly, I think Fargo deserves a lot more praise than it has been given, and should have easily taken out the Best Picture at the Oscars given the competition. This is by far the best film made by the Coen brothers, and is visually very pleasant to watch, with the sharpest, funniest dialogue ever. This is the type of movie that gets better every time you watch, and the people who dislike it simply aren't witty enough to understand the deadpan humour. The length is perfect, and the cast is flawless. Buscemi and Stormare are the best on-screen duo I can recall, and if you think about it, the stupidity of many of the characters simply add to the realism.

Genre Defying and Brilliant.,"Fargo (1996) has a simple opening - a car driving on a snowy day. Carter Burwells music in the background starts soft, yet sad - we know that this is the start of something tragic. As the car grows closer, the music grows louder, and we understand the scale of the tragedy about to occur - it is all about to go down, and it won't be good. This is one of many astounding scenes that comprise this movie.I can not express my intense love for Fargo enough. This movie is just sheer brilliance. It manages to be so much at once - tragic, hilarious, dark, gritty, touching, sad, tense. Yet the tone feels consistent throughout the movie. What makes it even more unique is its separation from heist movies - it just keeps topping itself. We've all seen movies where heists don't go according to plan - Dog Day Afternoon (1975), Reservoir Dogs (1993). But what Fargo does is it doesn't stop at one error, no - it just keeps going. Things just keep going wrong to the point where you, the viewer, believe that it just can't get worse. But then, of course, it does.Each character is unique and perfectly cast. The movie is known for Frances McDormands performance as Marge - a friendly, yet good cop. However, I also think that both Steve Buscemi's portrayal as Carl Showalter and Peter Stormares portrayal of Gaear Grimsrud are fantastic. The same applies to William H. Macys portrayal of Jerry Lundengaard. As I said, each character is unique and fleshed out, separate from the rest.There is so much brilliance in Fargo to be loved. The Coen brothers prove themselves as masterful filmmakers once again with this movie. If you have not seen it, I could not recommend it more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Appreciated, But Not My Favorite","""Fargo"" (1996) is a professionally produced crime drama about a kidnapping unraveled by small-time cop Marge Gunderson, played by Frances McDormand. Jerry Lundegaard, played by William H. Macy, hires two thugs to kidnap his wife in order to ransom her to his father-in-law to pay an undisclosed debt. I really enjoy films that I can identify with, rather it's the situation or specific character, or something that transports me into a different realm, unfortunately this film did neither for me. This film seems overly silly for such a serious genre that is based on true events. I am not a fan, but I can appreciate the unconventional approach.I have never been to either Dakotas nor Minnesota, outside of the airport, to attest to how they actually speak, but if they really sound like that, I may have to bite my tongue in saying it really hurt this film. I think I would have really enjoyed this film if there were less accents to detract from the storyline. This film, for me, painted everyone that wasn't rich as some type of simpleton with the silly accents, which by the end of the film is unfounded, especially for one particular character. The storyline, for as crazy as it is, especially based on real events, is really strong and followable. Overall, that one aspect mostly ruined the film for me as a viewer but allowed me to really appreciate other nuances in the beautifully shot cinematography. My recommendation to this film is solely for those who wish to approach a genre a little different.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Poorly Acted, Weak, Weak, Weak . . . Awful Plot . . . YUK","For those who haven't had the pleasure (???) of seeing the performance of Frances McDormand, read no further.  Ms. McDormand probably did the worst artificial Scandinavian sing-song dialect ever heard by man, woman or dead cat, except when a bad amateur mimic was mocking Norwegians, etc.  This story was really lame!  I walked out at the end (why did I stay till the end? - I don't know to this day) wondering who the movie critics were that recommended it - I would certainly not trust their opinions in the future. This movie was highly thought of in the worst movie year ever - all the candidates for the Oscar were weak, small films . . . that would never be CONSIDERED for awards in a normal year.  Compare 1996 to THIS PAST year (2001), especially at Xmas time, with several legitiimate 4-star movies out at the same time.  'Fargo' would not rate 1.5 stars if released in 2001. 1996 was a really hard-up year for Hollywood.  I left the theater think I had probably seen the worst flick of my life.

For a while I thought that it was a true story, then I realized that the murder of three people, including a police officer, would be taken very seriously. Instead of the case being given to one uniformed officer, a team of homicide detectives would descend on the scene.It would have been better if the makers of the movie had been straightforward about whether the movie is true.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Fargo (1996): A Captivating and Believable Tale, Earns High Praise","Fargo, released in 1996, is a standout film that earns high marks for its compelling narrative, intriguing characters, and a suspenseful plot that feels almost too real.

The narrative is crafted with skill, keeping the viewer hooked with its twists and turns. The fact that the story is based on real events adds an extra layer of intrigue, making it all the more captivating.The characters in Fargo are exceptionally well-developed and contribute significantly to the film's appeal. Each character is unique and adds depth to the story, making the events and their interactions feel authentic and believable. The performances are top-notch, bringing these characters to life in a way that's both entertaining and thought-provoking.One of the most striking aspects of Fargo is its ability to balance tension with moments of dark comedy. This blend makes the film not just a crime drama but also a fascinating study of human nature and behavior under extreme circumstances.In conclusion, Fargo is a brilliantly executed film that deserves its acclaim. Its combination of an engaging story, well-crafted characters, and a seamless blend of different genres makes it a must-watch. The film's portrayal of a crime story that's almost too strange to be true is what sets it apart and earns it high praise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A quirky crime-comedy which has much more to offer than what meets the eye.,"The ordinariness of the characters in this film are so carefully crafted, and if the scenes are carefully analysed in the light of all the information, the characters are really not simple and black/white as they seem. The Coen Brothers, being brought up in Minnesota, critique the Minnesota Nice nature - people with their plain and warm exterior with folksy speaking style, but not so empathetic or well-wishing from within; the characters are as cold and distant as the letters of the film title because the characters are as emotionally isolated as story's vast empty landscape. The accent and snow, the white and distant environment, all these things accentuate the feel of the living conditions and community of northern US. I can't testify to the accuracy of the time and place, but the Coens surely give us an intriguing character study.The film takes quite a few witty jabs at capitalism and consumerism; it explores people's (here, especially Americans') obsession with fast food, television and cars. The realistic dialogues and quirkiness do make the characters stand out, like all Coen Brothers films. Many might say Marge Gunderson is the only character with good morals, but she isn't as pure as she seems. Marge, though an interesting character who defies prescribed gender roles and becomes our lead protagonist (though she enters only after one-third the film), she is as emotionally distant as the rest, as evidenced from her murder-scene inspection and ending ride with one of the kidnappers. Her routine life and by-the-book procedure, combined with her husband's not-so- sophisticated paintings about ducks and the decor of their house, exemplify the fact how they are a regular couple in a consumerist web so blissfully content in their simplicity and mediocrity.Expectation vs what's given to us. From the opening title where it says that this is based on a true story and events are shown as it occurred, a certain expectation is set. The Coens take advantage of this liberty and tell the story in the most unusual but interesting way. But they subvert these expectations by slowly inserting scenes that people couldn't have known (if the events are being shown as they occurred). But this helps us understand the characters much better. (We now know that almost the entire thing is fictional, other than, maybe, the murder that inspired them.) The Coens do this throughout the film. Two other good examples come from the scene where Marge meets her Asian friend from college. Compared to the ways Asians are traditionally portrayed in films, Mike really stood out - not at all a clichéd, accented Asian guy, but an emotionally unstable lonely guy who still stays with his parents in his 30s. And the story he tells Marge about his life, we immediately lap it all up, just like Marge does, not realising that the story had the exact plot details from 'Love Story'. The Coens surely take other such jabs at American pop culture. It's not what you expect from a true-story-based crime thriller. It's not what you expect from a comedy. Coen Brother films never usually fit into a single genre, and the unusual blend of crime and humour makes the film stand out.And without Roger Deakins, the film wouldn't look the way it does. That parking lot scene has been praised and analysed to death by now. And yes, it's a spectacular shot and has so much to say. The acting from everyone in the cast is terrific, especially Steve Buscemi, Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. Macy gives us such a unique and memorably loathsome character - an apathetic, selfish and cowardly hypocrite, always maintaining such a cheery facade. But he represents the frustrations felt by the pawns in the capitalist system, rarely able to earn or save much to be financially or emotionally satisfied. Hence, his various schemes to collect enough money, run away and start a new comfortable life.Though just a little less than 100 minutes, the film has been assembled with such attention to detail and innovation that it can be analysed and understood in so many different ways. It's not something that seems so great in the first view itself, but the more you see it or think about it, the more it lingers in your mind. Clever to end the film with the words ""Two more months"", since we know it might be a reference to the end of winter when the snow might melt and reveal the suitcase to a passerby.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

hilarious,"This is one of the most hilarious films in the entire existence, and it also happens to be a story of kidnapping and homicide(s). The sheer comedy comes though not through one-liners or brainless jokes, but in the form of a situation in which a group of massively incompetent criminals are chased and hunted by a 7 month pregnant police officer. And the most important accomplishment of Coen brothers in this film is that as funny as the whole thing is, it's not so unbelievable. In fact, you'll find out that these are real people, people we might've known ourselves, that are going at it. Jerry Lundegaard is not a masterful lawbreaker, he's just a desperate, despicable mess in dire need of quick money, not nearly careful enough about what he's cooking. Likewise, Marge Gunderson is a talented policewoman that happens to be a human being, full of compassion and love for her relatives. That essence, normal people caught up in this story, is applicable to all main characters of this film, with an exception or two.Sometimes I think about what happens if, for example, my illiterate uncle gives a speech in, let's say Stanford university and I get a chuckle just by imagining such occurrence, watching Fargo offers a lot of these chuckles and sometimes laughters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""You're darned tootin'! ""","So, why is the movie called ""Fargo""? Maybe it's because that's where chaos starts. For the next 98 minutes, we watch a hapless, smiley, terminally nervous Minneapolis car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), try to settle some debts by engineering the kidnapping of his docile wife and wangling a ransom from his millionaire father-in-law. This scheme blows up in his face after he hires the wrong thugs in Fargo: Steve Buscemi as motormouth Carl Showalter and Peter Stormare as taciturn Gaear Grimsrud. The error soon results in a triple murder, with more deaths to come. And we also watch local super-sleuth Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), the very pregnant police chief of the Minnesota town of Brainerd, as she relentlessly tracks them down.The characters in Fargo are what keep the film going. Steve Buscemi plays Carl to perfection, talking too much and described as ""funny looking"". His colleague, Gaear is that shady silent type who likes to do things his own way and Peter Stormare delivers his threatening stares in a chilling way. For me, these two were the highlight of the film but William H. Macy pulls of Jerry brilliantly, displaying simultaneously a liar, a thief, a loving father and husband as well as ultimately a good guy whose life has taken a turn for the worse.

Fargo is interesting,"I liked Fargo because it was an interesting story and it shows what the Coen Bros. can do more than just comedy. It was creative in how they integrated comedy with the way that the criminal characters were really pretty sick and twisted. The characters in this are great too, how they picked actors that looked true to real life. I am a fan of all of the Coen bros. films including Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Excellent Directing. True Story Muddled by Undertones.,"This is a well done film, and I watched the whole length (often not the case), but it has issues.First, you have to be patient, because:
1) it moves very slow, and
2) there's a lot of filler.Second, you have to suspend your idea of film genre's being too rigid, e.g. Is this a murder
mystery, cops n' robbers, comedy, or a buffet of all three? It's a buffet.Many reviewers think very highly of the Coen brothers work, not me so much. Talented
no doubt, but their work reminds me of Tim Burton and Q. Tarantino - full of themselves.Nonetheless, this film is well-directed.STORY: Based on real events, it's plausible and bizarre at the same time. That's hard for me to bear
as I watched ... are people really that stupid, desperate, and living in little worlds cut off from ...
But, people do these things, and not just in the isolated mid-west. Kudos for whoever chased down
the details on this story because there's a lot to piece together.One of my issues is the pseudo-comedy of presenting these mid-westerners as ""walkie-talkies,""
especially the brutally air-headed way they speak. My impression is there's an undercurrent of
derision for accents, phrases, and their way of life. These mannerisms may be true, but it's unfair
to convey them as being unintelligent or unsophisticated. That was my impression.ACTING: The cast did an excellent job of getting into and staying in character. No one stands out,
and each was believable and genuine. Again, the raw stupidity was a bit hard to take seriously.TEMPO: Excellent tempo IF you don't mind being patient, end-to-end. Sometimes it feels like
it's going to speed up, and it does a bit, but returns to its base - slow paced. Again, this pace
dovetails with the whole ""living in an isolated world"" tenor of the film.CINEMATOGRAPHY: Excellent scenery, sound, and realism. I must give an A+ for the camera work.DIRECTING: As a whole, these guys do very good work - technically. I can't find a lot of error as to
mechanics, but I don't care for the undertones of superiority (as I perceive them to be). There are
very good directors that are are also humble, but I don't sense that with these guys. Maybe I'm wrong,
and other reviewers probably don't care. I do care, and don't think I'm wrong.Overall a good film. Rating here is 7.5.Depending on your taste, a much better film in a similar setting is ""Wind River"" with Jeremy Renner.Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Coen Brother's masterpiece......Darn Tootin!,"Fargo is rightly named one of the best movies of the 90's. Featuring some outstanding performances, a great script and some beautiful cinematography. Frances McDormand rightly earned herself the Oscar for Best Actress portraying Marge Gunderson, chief of Brainerd police.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is facing financial troubles. He concocts a scheme to get more money to support a new project he is undertaking. Jerry hires two men (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so he can get his rich father in law (Harve Presnell) to pay the ransom of $1,000,000. Unfortunately things get way out of hand.Fargo is a movie everyone needs to see. It is a mixture of many things. Crime, comedy, thriller, drama and romance. The screenplay is witty and packs many delights along the way. All the performances are perfect in this movie. The movies also is extremely true to life. The characters are not overdone or inhuman. Nothing seems unrealistic. If I were to name anything wrong with this movie it would be that it was too short. I really wanted it to continue on.4½/5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
American way to laugh,"I don't understand why Fargo is considered a so good movie. It's good, surely, but I think it's weaker than any other Coen's movie. Films like ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" or ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" are spectacular - and they tell very good and funny stories about American way to be... just like Fargo intended to do. I don't know what is so funny hearing Frances McDormand saying ""ya"" all the movie. Perhaps the Coens wanted to tell jokes only American could understand.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

UNIQUE AND DERN GOOD,"Fargo begins with a white canvas, and as the initial credits start to appear, the icy North Dakota landscape arises, with the strange flight of a bird through the snow. There is a warning that the story tells a real fact that happened in Minnesota in 1987, but that the real names were changed in ""respect to the dead.""The locations took place made in the two neighboring states and in the cities where the tragedy occurred. It looks like a home-made movie, as the directors, the Cohen brothers, Ethan, and director Joel grew up in Minneapolis.Every expectation falls apart as the story progresses, to the point of not knowing for sure whether we are witnessing a tragedy, as promised, or a satire, comedy, thriller, or thriller. It's a unique, unrivaled movie where transitions occur smoothly, and even violence seems ""natural.""The story revolves around a failed car salesman, Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), who desperately needs money for a deal that can save him from bankruptcy and also the domination of his wealthy father-in-law (Harve Presnell), who, by chance, owns the car agency where Jerry works.To make his investment viable, Jerry hires two scumbag lowlifes called Showalter and Grimsrud (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife Jean (Kristin Rudrud) and share the $ 80,000 ransom paid by father-in-law Wade. Simple like that simple. Said no one ever, because everything goes wrong and all expectations turn into nightmares in the most amazing ways possible.In the middle of the movie, some corpses begin to appear, frozen. Called to investigate possible murders, Brainerd's border town police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) also has an unexpected profile: pregnant, she needs to have her vehicle pushed to get the engine started, and before going to the police station, goes to the market to buy worms for her husband Norm (John Carrol Lynch) to fish.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Funny-lookin'""","In the 1990s the younger generation of independent filmmakers gained their prestige with some odd movies, movies that were both grim and noir-ish but with an almost nonchalant twist of comedy running through all the nastiness. This was the kind of picture in which the Brothers Coen specialised. Fargo is among their purest expressions of that type, a grisly thriller set in a snowbound Minnesota that, despite its inherent darkness, comes across as humane and affectionate.While the New Wave-influenced directors showed off an abundance of technique, the Coens and their generation have tended more towards minimalism. There's an elegant simplicity to their approach, with few camera moves or obvious artifice. That's not to say the Coens were directing on autopilot. The camera may not move but there's a lot of thought gone into those static shots. We see a beleaguered William H. Macy at his desk while cars rushing by on the freeway behind him seem to mirror his nervous jitters. In the opposing shot of the indignant couple, the array of statuettes makes it look as if the whole room's ganging up on him. It's a kind of meaningful shot composition that is actually rather witty. This triumph of the image over technicality allows the Coens to really bring out some detail. Many filmmakers may attach a camera to the front of a car for a bit of high-speed action, but in Fargo we have such a shot pointing down at the road surface in the headlights, picking out every little crack and grain. The Coens have really painted a world with palpable texture.But just as character seems to live in the very landscape of Fargo, it also lives in the actual characters, brought to vividness by a cast that's at just the right level of quirky. What's neat about Frances McDormand is that she is comical without actually doing a comedy performance. Other than a slightly strained accent, its all done in very genuine timings and expressions, which stops it slipping into farce and weaves it well with the movie's more unpleasant moments. William H. Macy is full of twitches and mannerisms, but he just manages to pull it inside the realms of believability. And Steve Buscemi too is straddling that delicate line on the edge of reality. In short, the people that inhabit the world of Fargo give us this impression of normality stretched to its limits, but normality all the same.Unlike your average thriller, Fargo is not exactly a tightly-constructed ride of suspense and excitement, but this doesn't mean it's not enjoyable and engrossing. Rather than seeming to have some grand theme or focused structure, it's as if the screenplay just grew organically out of a number of elements. Like many works by the Brothers Coen, Fargo is rich with the weirdness of America, with ominous statues of local heroes and checkout girls grinning vacantly like a taxi driver from Total Recall. Brilliantly offset by a doom-laden and very Nordic score from Carter Burwell as well as a sprinkling of familiar American hits, it scampers smoothly from one mood to the next. This isn't a big movie by any stretch, but it in its constant, delightful diversity, it seems to be part of some large and tangible world.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Kidnapping going bad : Coen style,"Coen brothers are known to be one of the most original film making duo working in Hollywood.A lot of adjectives can be used to describe their films and the great thing is that no two films made by them are same. Fargo is a great film as it doesn't hover around neither Hollywood type conventional narrative structure nor sometimes hard to fathom independent cinema style.It is a film in which mystery elements are revealed following a chronological order.Coen brothers have taken proper care of the screenplay as they have added their own material to a real life event which took place years ago.It is not at all a film about mistakes made while killing people. It is a film about human sentiments such as greed,helplessness and dedication to work.All those who like films with story are going to enjoy it.There are no special effects,animation and other high tech elements.What is to be seen in the film is pure emotional poetry-a poetry of human sentiments.The cast is outstanding especially Frances McDormand who makes a good try at being a workaholic pregnant policewoman.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Driving to Fargo with an offering,"This film starts like a story from the bible: A man travels through the desert with an offering. He concludes a deal with dark forces in Fargo. From then on the story winds down like a clockwork; everything that happens afterward is just bound to happen, there is no way out. Yes, human willpower has its limits - this seems to be the central message of this seemingly so Unamerican American movie.Live can be beautiful though, the thoroughly content police officer Gunderson proves it amply. She is happy at the thought that her husband carefully paints wild fowl for three cent postage stamps. Those who take strenuous exercises in trying to write down car serial numbers illegibly for a dumb scheme that will not work in the end are the less fortunate of this planet.I hope the Coen Brothers created officer Gunderson with the thought of a sequel already in mind. She would offer herself to it wonderfully. I would very much like to see how the Coens tackle the sequel issue. Why not send the Gundersons with the offspring somewhere on holiday (Morocco perhaps, like Jimmy Stewart in The Man Who Knows Too Much) where something happens? I am looking forward to that movie.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
7.4/10 - Minimalsitic and Full of Odd Charm,"Of the infinite films I'm yet to watch, the uncountable number of directors I'm yet to dive into, the film-nerd homework I still need to complete - the Coen Brothers' material has stuck out to me for a while now. Haven't watched any of their films up until now, and I thought that the time has come to change the situation. So yeah, my journey starts with Fargo.Now, Fargo follows Jerry (William H. Macy), a sales manager in a car agency who's got himself tangled up in some uncomfortable debts, unbeknownst to any member of his family. Jerry decides to do what every rational person would do in his place, and pay some criminals to kidnap his wife, so he can make his rich father-in-law pay a hefty ransom which will mostly go straight to Jerry's pocket. As one might've expected, things go awry rather quickly, and the situation gets quite hot in the snow-covered streets of Minnesota.I'd categorize this film as a blend of comedy and crime-centered drama, and it has a certain vibe that I think might just be this Coen-Brothers humor I've been hearing about. I can't quite put my finger on why, but the humor is really unique. The best way to put it I can think of is that the humor isn't based on any grand, over-the-top stuff, and not on jokes that characters tell, but rather on the fact that characters just act in a way that's slightly...off, and their dialogue bounces off of other characters really well. It's a quirky kind of humor, but it has a lot of charm and it works quite well for me.Talking about the humor not being grand and extravagant, it brings us to another point - this film's minimalism. Everything here, both story-wise and cinematography-wise, is pretty minimalistic. It makes a lot of sense from a narrative standpoint, since the characters' weird behavior might be explained by them being stuck in this bleak town with static noise in the background of their day-to-day lives, but besides that, it just makes this film feel more special. Fargo manages to be really well-made without looking for this all-out, spectacle vibes. I like it quite a bit. The scene near the Paul Bunyan statue, you know the one if you've seen the film, is soooo good looking even though It doesn't show much, really. Beautiful.The story's end feels a little weird, maybe because it's not that cathartic, but it goes well with the feeling that every character here has a life of itself, both before the film begins and after the film ends. Stories don't always have a perfect, neat ending, and it's fine, too.My point is: Fargo is a quirky blend of comedy and crime-centered drama, and it has a unique sense of humor and a cool minimalistic approach that has a lot of charm. I find it enjoyable, and I definitely plan on checking out other films of the Coen Brothers in the future. I'm feeling a 7.4/10 on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Coen Brothers Classic,"Jerry Lundegard runs his father-in-law's car dealership in Minnesota who always seems to be in massive financial trouble for one reason or another. Even after possible embezzlement at Jerry's place of work he still must go to absolute drastic measures. Thats when Jerry puts a scheme in motion to hire two out of area criminals to kidnap his wife in order to push his father-in-law to pay a million dollar ransom without his direct involvement. The hired men, Wade & Gaear, are successful in kidnapping Jerry's wife Jean but on the way to the safe house an unfortunate event leaves three people left in bloodshed. As Jerry attempts to mend the situation to keep the gears in motion and Wade & Gaear seemingly unravel a pesky, persistent, and very pregnant Sheriff Marge Gunderson is tenaciously motivated to unearth the truth of the murders so justice can be served.This film manages to be quite a poignant piece of filmmaking but in all regards deep within has beauty in it. Joel and Ethan Coen have always been fantastic storytellers but Fargo takes the cake with its twists, turns, and many layers leaves the viewer guessing until the very end. This is a very dark true story the pulls no punches in its brutality. The acting was phenomenal, the cinematography beautiful, and the musical score was on point. Might I add this cast is absolutely stacked even by todays standards. This is a 90's classic you need to add to your watchlist.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
interesting,"Fargo? Let's face it, the Cohen's didn't think ""Bemidji"" made a good sounding title. Being from Fargo, I remember when they were shooting the outdoor scenes (it was a warm winter and they were having trouble finding snow). The only scene in Fargo (and it wasn't even shot here) is at the very beginning. Everything else takes place in Minnesota. Some people criticized the accents (but I've been in a lot of little towns where the people sound exactly like that).That being said, I did like the movie. The pace was rather slow, but it was funny, maybe a little to violent for violence sake. It's good movie to rent if you've got nothing to do on a Sunday night.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best of '96,"The Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel, have created in Fargo their best film to date (and I'm writing this after The Big Lebowski). I've watched it I think four times and each time am again impressed with its outrageous excellence. If you love inventive camera work, intelligent scoring (Carter Burwell), sharp dialog, and a strong female lead (Frances McDormand, winning the Oscar)--and are not put off by occasional violence--then Fargo is well worth seeing (in fact, worth buying!).

"lightweight tragicomedy, but good fun","I had a great time watching this movie. I haven't laughed like that in front of the TV for ages. But...once it was over, it was over. In my opinion, it's really over-hyped - it's the story of Jeff (William H. Macy) who is in deep financial trouble...so he pays some small-time crooks (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife for part of a ransom he will extract from his wife's rich father. When the deed is done and the crooks are hauling Mrs. Jeff to their hideout, a cop stops them for not having the right tab on their car, and is shot. Uh-oh, two innocent bystanders noticed! Boom-boom, dead too. About four or five other people have gone to Jesus by the end, and the movie centers around Marge (Frances McDormand), the Fargo police chief trying to track down the killers. Her performance was actually pretty good as a sensitive woman who is intentionally oblivious, refusing to let the horrible things she must witness seep in and bring her down. Since Steve Buscemi is here too, you can predict the tone of the comedy, which is very dryly hilarious - the point of the movie is to contrast tragedy with comedy for a haunting and bittersweet ending. An interesting idea, but the tragedy wasn't tragic enough, it was disaffected in an odd way. Normally gruesome scenes are trivialized in a way that I don't like. It would have been very powerful had you just felt a bit more for the characters. As was, it was slightly off-kilter and I felt it left you with nothing. Great fun, however.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!,"I've always heard good things about Fargo, and once it made the AFI's top 100 list of funny movies, I decided to rent it. I very rarely rent R-rated films, but this seemed to be worth it.In short, my brother and I did not laugh once, nor did we enjoy the film.First of all, the film is violent and grotesque. I've seen many violent films before, but this went beyond anything I've seen. There are several murders committed. All of them are extremely disturbing in their depiction of blood and guts as well as the complete inhumanity of each killing.Second of all, the film has numerous moments of gratuitous sex which serve the plot no purpose, other than perhaps additional character degradation.In my opinion, this film is the second worst thing to happen to mainstream entertainment in the 90s.The worst thing is that people out there laughed at it.

Outstanding black comedy,"Desperate nebbish Jerry Lundegaard (an excellent William H. Macy) hires an erratic pair of criminals (played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife...and things go wrong, very wrong. 'Fargo' is one in a long list of superlative films produced and directed by the Coen brothers. The film is a dark, almost farcical, comedy with offbeat characters, an excellent sense of place (flat, wide, cold, and bleak), and the famous over-the-top Minnesota accents, especially from Academy Award winner Frances McDormand (""You betcha!""). The clever plot is a cautionary tale about just how hard pulling off a complex crime would be (unlike most 'caper films', few people in 'Fargo' respond as they were expected to) and the psychological strangulation as the noose tightens around Jerry is palpable. McDormand's 'Marge Gunderson', a heavily pregnant, always hungry, Minnesota cop investigating the increasingly bloody kidnapping is outstanding: perfectly blending the character's disarming 'Minnesota-nice' personality with her competence as an investigator. An entertaining and memorable film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I would marry this movie. Sincerely.,"I've seen Fargo probably 40 times, and you know how many times it took me to realize that this film is the mosy utterly perfect film of all time? ONE. Period. After the first time I saw it, I fell in love with it. Completely, head over heels in love. I have become a commonlaw husband to it, and I think I treat my copy of the film better than I will ever treat any woman (if you are a prospective significant other out there, I'm sorry.) This is the film I aspire to someday become fused within, to live with Marge and Norm ""Son of a Gun""derson, or the Lundegaards. This is the movie that made me think of movies as a higher art. THE higher art, I should say. There is never a dull moment in this film, and if you watch it with someone who likes to make talkie during the silences, please kick them in the head, every milli-second of silence is vital. This quiet, every milli-second, is crafted to perfection, and is worth any line of dialogue. Although I must say, the dialogue ain't bad.

One of Those Films You Hope Comes Around Once in A Blue Moon,"This movie put two things on the map: Fargo, North Dakota, and the Coen Brothers.The city has been around since 1871, and has a fairly interesting history (feel free to Wikipedia it), yet is best known for film that was made in 1996. Pretty sad, actually. You want to have some fun? Type in Fargo to Google and see what comes up. If your experience is anything like mine, then you will see first articles about the newish (and apparently very good; I should check it out) TV show, then the movie, and only third the actual city.The Coens have a fairly similar tale, though they are by now far more well-known across American than Fargo the city. Because it was their breakthrough into popular culture (and earned them their first Oscar), it was many a film-goer's introduction to them. As such, there are a fair amount of people who think that this is their first feature film when it is in reality their fourth.But enough posturing and preparing. Why did I give this film a perfect score? What specifically makes it so captivating? Why is it regarded as one of the greatest films of the nineties. Well, in one sentence, it seamlessly blends comedy and drama without missing a beat, delivering a film as thought-provoking as it is entertaining, as likable as it is nihilistic, as beautiful as it is gritty.I think if the Rotten Tomatoes review recap were a little more artsy, it would sound something like that.In 1987, a car insurance salesman, played nicely by William H. Macy, is desperate for money. A lot of money. So he arranges for his wife to be kidnapped by some random criminals in return for 80K and a new car. He will then tell his wealthy father-in-law (who owns the chain of car dealerships) about this, say the criminals want a million in ransom, give them the 80K, and take 920K for himself, so he can start his own operation and start making money his way.Now, if he were competent, this would have been a totally different movie. But he's not. No one is in this film. From the time you learn that he's a used car salesman, he feel almost a sort of pity towards him. He bungles around and sees everything crashing down on him, and there is nothing he can do about it. I won't spoil the ending, but it does not end well for him, or for any of the characters.There is nothing more powerful than a comedy-drama done right. Neither contemporary film critics nor general audiences usually like them at first, but history gives them windfall.Just because there is darkness does not mean that the movie has to be miserable. Thinking otherwise is how you get (relative) tripe like The Pianist or The English Patient while some of the greatest films of all time, like Leon: The Professional, a film I was reminded of more than a few times during my viewing of this, are shut out.But of course, Leon, while it has a more vivid, more adventurous tone than one would expect for its subject matter, is not a comedy. This is. We throw the phrase 'dramedy' around a lot to describe a series or movie or game that has a lot of comedic and dramatic moments. But that phrase has never seen more apt than it is here. This film is not just a comedy and a drama, it is a full fledged combination of the two. And it is beautiful to behold. The drama makes the comedy better and the comedy makes the drama better. This approach is hard to pull off, but when it works, oh it works. And it never works has well as it does here.A major theme in this film is imperfection. Think back to the title: they are in the far north, not the bright lights of NYC and Los Angeles. This motif is everywhere if you look for it, particularly in the characters. No one in this film is that confident or assured or smart. They are tragic characters, but not in the sweeping, cinematic sort of way, or even in the way we like to see reality portrayed. Rather, they are clumsy and awkward and angry; but not in an absolute way; they have some good in them too. Even one of the villains does something surprisingly selfless.At the start, we are told that this is a true story, but at the end, we are told that it is not. Right there is the confusion and sense of hollowness that the Coens make so much use of here. Risky conniving and strategy are cool when they are done well, but are tragic for most others, for most of us. And after all our quests and ventures, it so often is empty and worthless, which us all dying. It doesn't lull on it like dramatic films can, but rather weaves it into the dark comedy, which makes it all the more poignant.I do not like this film quite as much as No Country for Old Men, but it is a thoughtful, dark, masterfully-written, stunningly-shot, radiantly-scored film that you would be doing yourself a disservice to not see. You will not realize how invested in you are until half the film is already over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Smart,stylish,frozen film noir from the Coen Brothers","Just when the ultra-ironic, ultra-violent thriller seemed to have been done to death by Tarantino and his acolytes, along came the Coen brothers to breathe fresh life into the genre.David Mamet-favourite Macy is wonderfully weak and wicked as Jerry Lundegaard the Swedish-American car-salesman whose attempts to mastermind the perfect crime - the kidnapping of his wife - go horribly, violently and hilariously wrong. For a start he has hired two trigger-happy crooks, the verbose Carl (Buscemi) and the taciturn Gaear (Stormare) to carry out the kidnapping. Pretty soon people are starting to get shot and this attracts the attention of the smart, pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand, who deservedly won an Academy Award for her tough, funny, touching performance).With its central plot strand of the well-planned crime spiralling wildly out of control, the film investigates similar territory to the Coen brothers' brilliant debut Blood Simple, but Fargo is a more assured work, lighter and more layered. The cast, boasting at least three scene-stealing performances (Macy, McDormand and Buscemi), are on top form. The film manages the neat trick of trumping Tarantino by not merely being filled with laughs and slickly handled, literally visceral action sequences, but also presenting rounded, recognizably human characters.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Good but...,"This is a film many people think a lot about and try to read messages from in one way or another, when it seems it was just a nice film Coen wanted to make, end of story.I liked the most of it: the woods, the winter, and with a pregnant cop(!) as the main character. Since I'm from Sweden, it was kind of cool picking up the Americanized Swedish names - Gustafson, Lundegaard and a couple of more - it gave the film a more specific, unique and not very often used location and background which was really nice.There were not so good points however. I found the dialects too thick (they might talk like that in that are, I have no idea), the character development too shallow and the worst, too many loose strings and oddities thrown in. An Asian guy makes an appearance from nowhere, doesn't contribute and then disappears. The fate of a kid is never resolved, and so on.However, the thing that really lifts the film are the actors, mainly Buscemi in his best role ever. William Macy is great too and Frances McDormand do well, if not great. Stormare has the weakest part, mainly because his character is almost mute. Not easy to work under such conditions.So in short, I'd say this is well worth seeing after all. See it not as a Hollywood but as a well done school project.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Declines in quality on repeat viewing,"Completely honest viewpoint... I first saw this film in a theater during its initial theatrical run in 1996. A friend picked it out, as I had never heard of it until then. We sat through it, then on the way out, I said to him, ""Well, that was weird."" He looked at me and laughed, saying, ""I was just going to say that."" We then promptly forgot about it and started talking about someone else. It seemed like it would have done well as an extended episode of some bizarre TV series along the lines of ""Twin Peaks,"" etc. Something that you would watch once, and then next week, something different would happen with the same characters. But as a self-contained film, well, it's not enough of a story, not enough of a film. The months later, it was nominated for several Oscars, including Best Picture. On hearing that, I thought, ""Wow, Hollywood really liked it."" I have to admit I was rooting for Brenda Blethyn to win the Oscar for ""Secrets and Lies"" as I thought hers was the best performance of the year. So I was let down when Frances McDormand won, not that her performance wasn't award-worthy, just that the wrong person won that year. Thinking I had missed something profound about ""Fargo,"" I rented the DVD when it came out, I think in 2003. This time I could hardly stomach the violence in it. I wisely turned it off before one particularly gruesome scene happened. I don't see any point in sitting through it again. I was ready to write off the Coen brothers as filmmakers, until I rented ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" which was brilliant. Sorry, but that's just my honest opinion about ""Fargo.""",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A 90 minute film that feels like 20 minutes,"""Fargo"" is a film that is incredibly fun. It makes the most of its simple but very well-constructed story and turns it into one of those films that seems to fly by way too fast. It perfectly blends black comedy and drama, and its quick pace makes it a very re-watchable film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Far good (tv),"I like very much Frances and that was my motivation to see this movie. It was a great surprise to see that William « Frank » Macy stars also, all the more than his character could be the sober twin of the Gallagers family patriarch. On the other hand, it was a disappointment to notice Stormare as this actor really cringes me with his too much attitude verified as always in this movie. As i have written in my review for « Arizona Junior », the Cohen brothers are the movies cousin of Stephen King as they are really share this taste for the rural America. Here, the country land is all the more put in relief as it's winter time. The story is interesting because it's a true drama that is chilly as it's unbelievable that the husband found such a stupid idea and such bums to help him ! In this strange world, Frances is totally exceptional : i can't really explain but she has the gift to put me at rest, to make me happy and her character is really like this : she smiles to everyone, she is respected by her friends, her co-workers, she has a caring husband and will be soon a mother. It's a really change from the today cops as violent as the criminals they arrest. This Frances recalls Columbo, Dale Cooper, Fox Mulder, the strong arm of the law but with a big heart. She worths truly her Oscar and the movie is really good !",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Should have watched sooner!,"Can't believe I never watched this before, I normally don't like slow movies but this one was paced so perfectly. This movie was so great, I couldn't get enough of it.

Very Original Black Comedy,"This cult classic was nominated for seven Oscars, winning two.The story is told in two parts. The first is about a car salesman who seems to have a compulsion to win, at any cost, no matter how large or small the stakes. Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is terrific in this part, capturing his contrasting moods of an emotionless exploiter and a manic paranoid. The second part centers on a mild-mannered police detective named Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) with an aw-shucks brand of personality that hides an analytical mind.The film is certainly quirky. Like Tarantino meets Monk. Accordingly, there is a thread of humor, but this is a black comedy of errors, and it is definitely not for everyone. But it is filmed well and the acting is genre-appropriate, making it very watchable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the best films of the 1990s,"I've seen this film twice now and have just bought the video.  Having read some of the negative comments on this website, I can only say - you just can't appreciate good filmmaking!  It's brilliant, quirky, blackly humourous with great performances and a memorable score.  Even after I had seen the film I could hear Carter Burwell's memorable music.  The performances of Frances McDormand, William H Macy and Steve Buscemi are all terrific. It's also unusual to see a film set in a part of the US that we in the UK aren't too familiar with.  The complaints I've read about the accents are unjustified - the Minnesota accent certainly makes a change after all the NY, Californian and Southern accents we've heard in the past.One more thing - it's allegedly based on a true story which happened in 1987, but the end credits state it's fictional.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It's okay,"I understand the praise and high ratings for this film. It's just not my style. The Coen brothers have made much better. McDormand, Macy and Buscemi are terrific actors as well, I just found the story to be a bit narrow. To be honest I enjoyed the first 2 seasons of the Fargo series to be much more enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Fantastic crime movie,"Fargo is agreat movie on so many levels. First of all: The story is awesome. Not the type of crime story you find often, really original and especially well-written. I love how in the beginning you feel sorry for Mr. Lundegaard and you want to keep that feeling so bad, but by the end it becomes so clear that there's really no reason for feeling sorry. 
All the characters are protrayed spot-on, I enjoyed Frances McDormand's performance in particular (like everybody probably). Also, the dialogues and humor are just classic by now.
Another very nice thing is the very original cinematography, often not using typical thriller elements and adding a taste of drama to the flick. Visuals and sound are executed meticulously, you see and hear so many little details that not everybody would have thought of.
The last thing I want to add that I liked was the runtime. At 98 minutes, it's anything but a long movie and squeezing a complex, yet understandable and entertaining plot in there is quite achievement.I loved Fargo, there's really nothing bad that comes to mind.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Okay but too Overrated,"Fargo was an okay film, but I will not recommend to see it twice.  The acting was so believable enough that I thought that they were actually from Minnesota.  On the other hand, the film is kind of predictable and you might know what kind of ending it will have just by watching half of the movie. Also, the only character that I cared about through the entire film was Marge (the policewoman) the other characters I didn't care whether they died or not, I guess that says a lot about the film.  Also, I think they should have cut a few parts of the movie since they don't have anything to do with the main story; but I suppose they put it there just to be funny.  I'm totally surprised that this film went up all the way to 76 in the rankings. I have to say that the plot was different and if you want to see a really good rental and its winter time do rent this, it will feel like it happened right next door, but you won't be missing much if you don't.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Highly Recommended,"'FARGO' - 1996Directed by Ethan and Joel CoenStarring William H Macey, Frances McDormand and Steve BuscemiPlot Overview: ​In an attempt to fund an unknown project, Jerry Lundergaard(William H Macy) hired two criminals, Carl(Steve Buscemi) and Gaear(Peter Stromrare) to kidnap his wife and hold her for a million dollar random, against her incredibly wealthy father. But in the meantime, pregnant police chief Marge(Frances McDormand) is hunting the criminals for a crime they committed amidst the job.My first taste of the Coen Brother's work was with a little movie called 'The Big Lebowski'. I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought it was a brilliant 'joke' of a movie. Not in terms of quality but of content. After seeing 'The Big Lebowski', I began to hunger for seeing the remainder of their work. And thus I came onto this little gem of a movie. Fargo is, in my opinion, much better than The Big Lebowski and is a comedic crime story of epic proportions. If you haven't already seen it, I recommend you check it out!But what is actually GOOD about the movie? Well, the story certainly springs to mind. From second one until the first name on the credits, Fargo gripped me and held me hostage on the edge of my seat. I was captivated by the events on screen and drawn deep into the mysterious and ingenious world, devised by the Coens. And while the statement about this being based on true events is a false one, it may as well have been true because the Coens do their absolute best to convince you that it is all the way through.So what else was excellent? The performances? Yeah, I will agree with that. William H Macey delivers a truly amazing performance as Jerry Lundergaard and kept me entwined in his conniving scheme all the way until the end of the movie. Frances McDormand also does a sensational job as Marge and provides much of the backbone for which the movie rests on. McDormand is a relatively unknown actress in the film world(she was to me anyhow) but she proves that she deserves more recognition with her Oscar Worthy(and winning) performance. And then there is there is Stevie 'Slimeball' Buscemi. Whenever I see this guy speak or move in any of his roles, I get goosebumps. Whether that is a testament to his marvellous acting capabilities or his perverted face, I don't know. All I do know is that the man is an awesome actor and that is certainly no different here. Harve Presnell was also very good as Wade Gustafson.Despite not saying much and having a minimal role, Peter Stromrae delivers a truly amazing performance and steals a lot of the scenes he is in. It was truly and incredible performance. I mean, I've admired the man in other roles, both in TV and film, but this is the first time he has genuinely amazed me and made me see his enormous potential as an actor. You probably think I am overselling him but I don't care.Thirdly, the cinematography and editing are exceptional. Fargo is a fantastic looking movie and it is a visual treat. Even the costume and set designs look fantastic and well thought out. It is a very, very technically proficient movie.If I was to say one flaw, it'd be that the ending wraps up a little too quickly. I think it was overly abrupt and maybe an extra 5 minutes would have done to let it settle and flourish. Maybe that is just me but that is honestly my main flaw with the movie.In conclusion, I can wholeheartedly say that I recommend Fargo. The comedic moments intertwine with the dramatic moments perfectly. They fit like a glove and do nothing to take away from the movie. The story is great, the acting is exceptional, the visuals are gorgeous; what is NOT to like in such a well rounded and thought out movie? Well I've already told you one thing but I challenge thee to find another. I highly recommend this movie; I'll rate it 9 'YARS' out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
It's as good as everyone says it is,"Fargo is the first Coen brothers movie to really attract some critical and box office success and the first film to start attracting the attention that the Coens' should have been getting all along. Fargo is yet another of their twisted fairy tales that can be watched over and over and you never get tired of it. Coen regulars Frances McDormand, Peter Stormare, and Steve Buscemi all do a fabulous job. William H. Macy does his character so well that this role will follow him the rest of his career. The sets and scenery perfectly portray the bleak midwestern landscape. Like other Coen films, this movie blends seriousness and humor to keep the mood light and keep the film from being a bland downer. There are better Coen films out there but this remains one of their best. Bottom Line: It's a great movie and one well worth buying. If you haven't seen it yet you're missing out.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece,"This is an amazing movie. It has a great plot, story, as well acting and directing. The Coen brothers have made hit after hit after hit and most of their movies are simply masterpieces. Fargo is no different. With a great blend of thrills and comedy Fargo in my opinion offers something most movies fail to offer and it succeeds on every level. The film is perfectly cast. McDormand as the police office was hilarious. Just the way the talk and the lines the characters say makes this movie worth it. It's as if they don't take what they're doing seriously but you know they do. This is right up there with Raising Arizona, Blood Simple, The Big Lebowski and O Brother Where Art Thou as a Coen Brothers classic. Over all the film is awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
1 of My Top 5 Films,"I am expressing my impartial opinion, and I am stating objective thoughts about Fargo (1996), which everyone shares. This is one of the greatest films to ever be created; Fargo (1996) is an absolute flawless masterpiece. It perfectly represents the complex dichotomy of the USA's Midwest, that fleshes out modern day human interaction at its core. It is captivating, dramatic, engaging, funny, hilarious, intriguing, mesmerizing, sad, and can even be scary at times. It makes me feel a mesh of emotions, that I have yet to find from any other film. I have been watching it for as long as I can remember, and it is the film I find myself going back to most often. I can only hope that, one day, I will find a film that is able to stand side-by-side with Fargo (1996) rather than in it's shadow.This is my first IMDb review, which I wrote because, it was the last task on my ""Profile Checklist"". When I saw that the final task was to write a review I immediately thought to write one for Fargo (1996). It is one of the 4 films I recommend most often people, the other three being Ran (1985); The Thing (1982); & The Godfather (1972), and Fargo (1996) is the suggestion I consider to be the most accessible. If you find yourself reading this review, and have enjoyed Fargo (1996), I greatly recommend Ran (1985) and The Thing (1982) which are 2 of my other top 5's. Also possibly Brazil (1985) to a lesser degree, it isn't one of my 5 favourite films but is still in my top 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Lost focus several times,"Perhaps it is because of my familiarity with the superior works of the Coen brothers, or maybe it's simply due to the fact that'Fargo' lacks the refined storytelling found in some of their other films. Whatever the reason may be, this movie did not resonate with me as much as I had hoped it would.The narration seemed to consistently lose focus, often deviating from the intended course. While there were moments of intensity, particularly during the scenes of violence and bloodshed, the writing severely struggled to effectively balance its comedic elements. It fell short of the level of competence that it could have achieved.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Possibly the Greatest Film Ever Made,"The first time I saw Fargo and the credits rolled with the impeccable theme song, I had a feeling in my gut that I had seen an incredible work of cinema.The Coen brothers are absolute geniuses, and this is their best work.Fargo will make you laugh, it will make you feel nauseated by the violence, but most of all, it will make you think. I wrote an extended essay on the meaning behind the perfectly timed comedy, and how the Coen brothers are genius even in the goofiest of writing. Their exploration of gender roles and greed really make you wonder about the world.Everyone should see this movie. But not kids. They would get kind of messed up if they watched it too young.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
An excellent film filled with an incredible script and brilliant performances,"Fargo isn't exactly an exciting idea. Sure there's a lot of conflict, but it doesn't shock or grab the viewers attention. So the Coen brothers decided to fill it to the brim with an excellent script and very sharp performances. And it worked. Fargo succeeds in nearly all levels of film, the direction, the writing, the acting. Frances Mcdormand won an Oscar for her portrayal as a small time cop, her performance is both sweet and effective, utter perfection too. William H. Macy lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. but I strongly felt Macy deserved it. Every little detail on his face is so perfectly acted out, you know this character and feel him. Steve Buscemi is good here, but isn't exactly oscarworthy. The script keeps a tight net on all characters, and the direction was good too. The only real flaw with Fargo is that some scenes feel out of place and the acting sometimes falls apart. It's rated R because there are a couple of heavy sex scenes, quite a bit of graphic violence, and some swearing. The only reason I give it this score is because of personal choice. 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Decent,Fargo was an enjoyable film and probably could be best summed up as a comedy of errors. This definitely has the stamp of the Cohen brothers on it with its tangents and side plots. The strength of this film to me is the strong performances from the cast.This film is well put together and culminates in a bit of tragedy for almost everyone. It is memorable enough but I wouldn't go as far to say it's iconic and I know I'm the minority with that. A stronger plot and more focused scenes I feel works better during screen time. A number of people are fond of the various side plots/tangents that kind of lead to nowhere and don't really add value. For example the scene with Margie and person she went to school with trying to chat her up added little to the story. This is a simple and ironic story but it is certainly not of Shakespearean proportions.,7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A highly overrated piece of garbage,"""Fargo:"" has to be one of the most overrated films in history. Academy Award nominations and wins? Breathless praise for Frances McDormand? Talk of it as a classic? One of the best 100 movies of all time?Give me a break! I'm sorry, but the plot was as flat as the landscape, the violence was off-putting and there wasn't enough humor to make this movie a black comedy. I don't have anything against the Coen brothers; ""Raising Arizona"" was great. But this effort failed miserably, in my opinion.Why was McDormand honored so highly? All she did was walk around a little, drink coffee and talk in an exaggerated Midwest accent. Macy, I'll admit, was good. But overall, the film was a miserable waste of time. I guess I'll never understand some people's idea of ""classic.""",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"dark, funny and clever","The film is set in the cold landscape of Minnesota and follows the story of Jerry Lundegaard (played by William H. Macy), a car salesman who hires two criminals (played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife and demand ransom from his wealthy father-in-law. However, things quickly spiral out of control, leading to a series of darkly comedic and violent events.One of the standout aspects of ""Fargo"" is its brilliant writing and storytelling. The Coen brothers masterfully blend elements of crime, dark humor, and drama, creating a unique and engaging narrative. The dialogue is sharp, witty, and filled with memorable quotes that have become iconic in popular culture.Frances McDormand delivers an outstanding performance as Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police chief investigating the bizarre and violent crimes. Her portrayal of a tenacious, down-to-earth, and deeply empathetic character earned her an Academy Award and remains one of her most celebrated roles.The film's cinematography and direction also contribute to its overall brilliance.

Black Comedy + Subtle Satire = FARGO / Best Picture 1996,"Anyone who cannot see, enjoy, and appreciate:-the subtlety of this movie,-the subtlety of the performances, esp.

But if you find yourself appreciating even one of those items above, then you are on your way to understanding why this small movie will live on long and prosperously after the pompously presumptuous 'English Patient' has been relegated to its deserved obscurity and finally dethroned from its dubious place as 1996's Best Picture.Yaaa?

That's not a criticism of the film, after all, it was an attempted true account of real life incidents, but for all the exceptional camerawork & scenery, the plot just wasn't strong enough to carry an entire 100 minute film, but ignoring the occasional scenes that served little purpose it was otherwise good.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Checking it out recently it's not quite as fresh as it once was,but it's still well done and solidly entertaining. I can see now how it has influenced later films and character development in the industry. McDormand perfectly creates a wacky character that you just can't seem to get enough of.

Warm & Cold,"A very entertaining movie, Fargo has principally 3 faults, all 3 of which are story related:1. Fargo opens with the following text: ""THIS IS A TRUE STORY. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987. At the request of the survivors, the names have been changed. Out of respect for the dead, the rest has been told exactly as it occurred.""This is a lie. Definitely in the way this sentence comes over, this is a lie. It becomes evident as you watch the events unfold that they are absolutely not a realistic retelling of any specific crime story. That text comes right at the beginning and, as such, sticks in your memory. Someone knowingly put this into the movie, and it feels insulting.2. Unresolved plot. The main premise is that this guy is trying to carry out several different of illicit activities because he desperately and urgently needs a lot of money. His panic and desperation are extreme, but it is never explained why he needs the money. He decides to commit a horrible crime and it is never explained why. And this is not the only thing Fargo doesn't show because it decided that it is not important.3. The general lack of impact. Despite some sudden violent events occurring, this movie feels very low key and rather slow. I understand it's part of the style, but you must be aware that Fargo takes its time and does not amount to a whole lot, especially considering the aforementioned points 1 and 2. When the film ended, it felt more like I just saw an episode of a show rather than an entire movie.Despite these flaws, it was a lot of fun to see the continuously worsening situation the criminals find themselves in and the calm investigation by the protagonist.The movie has a very particular style in both its visual presentation and story. The events take place in the winter in Minnesota and the outside world is a desaturated cold whiteness. It is starkly contrasted by the warm cozy lives of the common people inside the warm houses, with the warm food and the warm friendly feelings. This is also contrasted with the cold violent dealings of the criminals and everybody's hidden misery. Fargo is warm and cuddly and at the same time cold and disturbing.Fargo has a unique soundtrack. It is built on a slow tune of strings, much of it in the medium to lower register, with slow and deep bass drum beats in the background and some high pitch percussion. It has a folksy and meditative feel to it. When some sort of action happens, the music either goes quiet or continues with a grave tension but never becomes fast. It is not your average movie soundtrack and that's refreshing.William H Macy is amazing. He switches facial expressions in an instant. His panic and pain, his whole miserable situation are so extreme and so perfectly expressed. His passive aggressive politeness makes it all the funnier.Frances McDormand, as the protagonist policewoman received an academy award for her subtle humorous performance. There is something Charlie Chaplin about her. I frankly like Macy's performance a little more. McDormand's character hides intelligence and discomfort behind her silly smile while Macy's smile hides panic and deceit. Both are great.Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are funny just standing next to one another. There is a stark contrast in their character that makes them appear like a comedic duo, where one is long and the other is short.At the same time, Peter is a guy who is just naturally extremely unnerving. In this movie he does not talk much or move his facial features. His lifeless expression and composure are just naturally terrifying and the scary impression he gives is justified when he suddenly does something violent.There is a small complaint about the dialogue. While it is generally entertaining, there seems to be a strange mockery going on as the characters keep saying ""ya"" a lot, which is ""yeah"" spoken in the northern accent. I cannot figure out if this is supposed to be joke or just poking fun at the Northerners, but it gets annoying after a while.Fargo feels different than your average film. It is a bit slow but it is a charming and interesting movie. This movie makes you feel warm inside, despite its violent content.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Coens at their best?  Possibly...,"The Coen Brothers are in that rare stratum of writers/directors who seem to have formed a genre of their own. (Woody Allen, Hitchcock and Wes Anderson are other examples)The argument over which is their greatest film will never be settled, but Fargo is surely a strong contender. The Coens always manage to create atmospheres that are simultaneously realistic and stylised; rarely comfortable. Here, in the relationship between Marge and Norm Gunderson, there's a rare glimpse of their ""cozy"" side - and it's wonderfully touching. Outside of that, however, the film is unsettling, occasionally vividly violent, and darkly comic.The gradual disintegration of Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy), as his spineless, cowardly plan unravels, and he flails against the ever-tightening net of his own lies, is a sight to behold, with the Macy playing the part absolutely perfectly - you almost feel sorry for him at first, but your sympathy runs out as the film continues.Meanwhile, Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, one of the most admirable police officers ever seen on screen - this is not a bumbling, dull-witted small-town copper. Nor is she the ace detective with a disastrous home life we see so often. An original, rounded character with depth, a history and a future.Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare... well if they've turned in a bad performance between them on film I'm yet to see it.It's a crime drama, a thriller, a dark comedy... but really the best description of Fargo is, It's a Coen Brothers Film.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The characters, the actors chosen, the setting in Minnesota/Minneapolis, the dialogues, the attention to detail all work cohesively. It's a brilliant work of creative filmmaking.I was spellbound from beginning to end. I think you really feel like you're there with them in the year 1996. Filmmaking has come a long way since then however a classic piece of filmmaking simply cannot be overlooked.I give this 8/10 for the amount of madness the Coen brothers have been able to squeeze in 1 hour and 38 minutes.

The Coen Brothers strike gold!,"Anyone who's seen ""Fargo"" has experienced something they've never experienced before. The Coens are back and they're better than ever!Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, a pregnant police woman who becomes enthralled in a scandalous kidnapping/murder case involving swindling used car dealer Jerry Lundegaard, who's hiring two buffoons to kidnap his wife so her father will cough up a large ransom.What's so surprising about this film is that it's funny while it's suspenseful. The scenes with the kidnappers have strong language and violence and are usually serious while the scenes with Marge and her husband are quite humorous.I was captivated right at the beginning when I purchased the DVD. It opens to a black screen with white lettering stating that the following film is a true story. Out of respect for the dead, some of the names have been changed. Entirely engrossing but yet entirely not true.Director Joel Coen said later that if you know that the movie is based on actual events, they'll believe anything on the screen, even if it's totally unrealistic.There are so many scenes that are ingenious: the infamous woodchipper scene, Marge and her accomplice Lou discussing the dealer plates on the murderer's car, Marge cracking a joke about a guy changing his name to ""J37-2404,"" and more.Anyone and everyone should see ""Fargo"" some time in their life, whether it be on television or video, see it! It's extremely inventive, hilarious, and still manages to be gratuitously violent.NOTE: When Buscemi is pulling the dead body of the cop after shooting him in the head and the car's headlights are seen getting closer and closer in the distance, this must be a reference to the Coen's first film ""Blood Simple"" in which there's a similar scene.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Review-Fargo,"Review: 'Fargo' Another film by the Coen brothers, Fargo, starring William H. Macy, Frances McDormand, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, is about a man in financial problems who devises to hire men to kidnap his wife so his wealthy father in law will pay for her release and in turn pay off his debt. Fargo is a crime, drama and a thriller. It was released in 1996. To be completely honest I didn't really like this film I had seen 'The Big Lebowski' before going into this film and just had such high hopes. I thought 'The Big Lebowski' was far superior. Although I thought that having Steve Buscemi as a major character was better than how he is in 'The Big Lebowski' with him only having a couple of lines, even still he was very funny in 'The Big Lebowski'. His performance as Carl is very good. He plays a very violent, crazy guy. His partner in crime Gaear played by Peter Stormare is also portrayed very well and its actually quite funny watching him grimace at the violence of Buscemi's character. One of the reasons I thought 'The Big Lebowski' is better is because I thought it was far funnier. In 'Fargo' I felt that too many times the comedy was centred on the characters accents. It was funny the first time but it got old quick. Especially for Frances McDormand's character I felt that most of the humour was just the accent. Apart from one scene I didn't really like her character. When she is interviewing one of the criminals and he drives off and she exclaims 'oh for Pete's sake, he's fleein' the interview' I thought that was her standout scene to be honest. I thought she over did the 'Yas' throughout the film. I especially found it hard to relate to her and sympathize with her. I felt the overuse of the accent again was the cause of that. I think the jokes with the accent went over my head because I've never been to Minnesota. One thing that really worked for me was the visuals. For me the setting is the reason for this. The snow really makes everything look great. The contrast between the dark clothes of the characters and the snow looked really good. I think the most iconic thing for me is the scene where the car drives past the statue of the lumberjack. This for some reason just really stuck out in my mind. Whenever I think of Fargo I think of that statue. In conclusion the story is decent, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are excellent along with William H. Macy. Frances McDormand is a bit hit and miss as well as most of the humour in the film. In the end, I give it a 6/10. I found it very hard to like it especially in comparison with 'The Big Lebowski'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
All about bumbling criminals,"""Fargo"" was the breakthrough of the Coen brothers to a big audience. In my opinion it is still their best film, although ""No country for old men"" (2007) is their most popular film nowadays.In ""Fargo"" there are no master criminals and an even smarter detective. To the contrary. The criminals are rather amateurish and the crime gets out of hand rather quickly. In this way ""Fargo"" combines crime with comedy.It is therefore not accidental that the Coen brothers made a remake of ""The ladykillers"" in 2004. This film was no success. In the first place the crime element of this film is very subordinate to the comedy element. In the second place the original by Alexander Mackendrick (1955) was very hard to surpass.Another film with rather unprofessional criminals and a crime that gets out of hand is ""In cold blood"" (1967, Richard Brooks). This film doesn't have a comedy element whatsoever. What it does have in common with ""Fargo"" is a lot of violence. The violence in ""Fargo"" is however of such a caricatural and cartoon like nature that it somehow doesn't disturb.""Fargo"" is situated in the Mid North of the United States. The native region of the Coen brothers, but also the residence of a minority from Scandinavia. One can see this from names like Lundegaard, Gunderson and Grimsrud but also from there melodious English (Swedish is a very melodious language). Maybe even there hidden, indirect way of communicating can be traced back to their origin. When her collegue has said something stupid detective Marge Gunderson (Francis McDormand) says: ""I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou."".The quote above already indicates that not only are the criminals amateurish, also the police is all but glamorous. This is further emphasized by Marge Gunderson being heavily pregnant and wobbling through the movie. Also awkwardly holding a cup of coffee in thick mittens (it is winter and there is a lot of snow) doesn't look very sharp. But don't be fooled, Marge may seem a little sheepish at first, her conclusions are sometimes razorsharp. She is almost a female detective Columbo (Peter Falk).",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Overrated? Completely!!,"After hearing a lot of hype over this film I decided that it was time I sit down and watch it, and after seeing this piece of work I must post the question that I feel is obvious. What makes this movies stand out as a cinematic masterpiece? If someone could enlighten me as to why please do. There were no real dynamic characters, no one I felt sympathy for or any connection to; overall it was not entertaining. The storyline was slow, it dragged on to a conclusion that, frankly just wasn't there. Honestly there were like ten different people killed and I was still bored. Finally, I've seen posts where people seem to flip over the ending, it wasn't deep or thought provoking, it was a dead end to a highly overrated picture.

Is this a masterpiece? You Betcha!,"Fargo is a film about a kidnapping plot that goes very very wrong.Jerry Lundegaard is a car salesman who has sunk deep into debt and has a simple plan to get out : hire two criminals to kidnap his wife, and then keep part of the large ransom his employer and father-in-law will pay to get his daughter back.But nothing goes according to plan as the antagonists are continually thwarted at every turn. One of the highlights of the film is how the bad guys are NOT criminal masterminds.Hot on their trail is the very pregnant and perpetually chipper police chief Marge Gunderson, who gets involved after ""some malfeasance"" (her exact words) turns up next to a Brainerd, MN highway.Everything in this film is delightful: William H. Macy and Frances McDormand shine as Jerry and Marge but the entire cast is stellar. The cinematography perfectly captures the snowy terrain.

It won Oscars for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Frances McDormand) and Best Writing (the Coen Brothers).Fargo is certainly one of the Coen's finest and most famous movies. It claims to faithfully relate a true story that occurred between Fargo, North Dakota and Minnesota's Twin Cities in the late 1960s. The real story is anything but funny. But, this movie has its share of both humor and of black humor.The movie begins in Fargo as Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is making contact with two ""professional"" thugs to arrange for his own wife's kidnapping. Jerry, a car dealer from Minneapolis, with big personal money problems, wants his wife kidnapped because he knows his father-in-law is very wealthy and will pay the ransom for his own daughter.The idea is that once his father-in-law pays off the thugs and his wife is released, and he can split the ransom with the thugs. HOWEVER, once the deal is made and Jerry gives them one of the cars off of the lot, things start to go downhill when the quitter of the two thugs kills a policeman for stopping them to ask why the car has no tags. The killing of the policeman leads to two other passersby being killed.After this triple homicide, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand), a pregnant cop is called into the case. As the movie develops—and the kidnapping scheme unravels—we are entertained by both the stories and characterizations of Marge's friends and family as well as Jerry Lundegaard's constantly frustrating and deteriorating predicament(s).",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Darkly Comic Masterpiece,"Fargo is a 1996 crime drama film directed by Joel and Ethan Coen. The film follows the story of Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), a car salesman who hires two criminals (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife in order to extort money from his wealthy father-in-law. However, things quickly go awry, and the plan spirals out of control, leading to a series of violent and tragic events.Overall, Fargo gets 3.5 out of 5 stars from me. The film's unique blend of dark humor and realistic comedy was definitely its strongest point. The Coen brothers have a knack for creating memorable and quirky characters, and Fargo is no exception. Macy gives a standout performance as the hapless and desperate Lundegaard, while Buscemi and Stormare are both menacing and hilarious as the bumbling criminals.However, the film's plot wasn't quite as complex as I was expecting. While the story was entertaining and kept me engaged, it didn't quite have the depth or nuance that I was hoping for. Still, Fargo is a clever and entertaining film that is sure to delight fans of dark comedy and crime dramas. If you haven't seen it yet, it's definitely worth a watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Trying so hard to be unique and quirky,"Coen brothers are sometimes confused between creativity and bizarreness. Many masterpieces bring in original script, directing, editing, or camera walk, but none of them appears to show off these efforts. It just shows. Coen brothers... I can clearly see what they are trying to do here. 'I'm so cool, so I'm gonna make this movie so unique and original. I will try to bring out jokes and comical air amidst serious crime, deceit, and psychopathic behavior and call it black comedy.' To do this, they need tighter, more developed, and more enchanting storyline. The story itself is loose; many scenes without any meaning just to emphasize the movie's quirkiness; unnecessarily inhumane and disgusting scenes not producing any effects. AND why does this movie ardently claim that it is a true story when it is not? I feel so cheated.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I gave it a 6 anyway, because it was yet interesting, in particular for dialogues and characters. There was an eerie atmosphere, too. But the balance between noir and comedy resulted in a tie, with no spectaculars... Of course a movie may have a complex order, but it always needs an order. Here we see scenes that don't have a direction, every one going its own way. It looks like a collection of random shots. As for humor, there are some hilarious lines, but I really mean 'some'.I understand somebody may appreciate it more than me and give it a 7, but anything above is pure overrating.In conclusion, if you've heard about Fargo and hope to find that particular humor in it, you'd better see 'The Big Lebowsky'.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Frances McDormand - Best Oscar speech ever,"It's unbelievable that even after Frances McDormand showed us what speeches ought to be like, people keep making silly Oscar speeches after another.

Frances McDormand adds and essence of comfort and balance to this violent story, and that is not what every person can do. Certainly not many who have been soaked in Hollywood.I truly admire that she's a type of a person who can walk up to the end of the red carpet and say that it's great that five women were given complicated rows. That she appreciates the Academy not for recognizing her, but for acknowledging their work. That instead of trying to squeeze in all the unknown names in the world, she made it short and simple by saying that the director made an actress out of her, the husband made a woman out of her, and the children made a mother out of her.I am thankful for having humans like Frances McDormand be acknowledged in Hollywood.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Frances McDormand shines!,"Fargo (1996) is a Cohen Brothers film, starring Frances McDormand and William H.

She is investigating a case of three homicides, and it turns out to be attached to something much bigger. William H.

The writing is great too, the dialogue for each character suits them perfectly. It's so great to see a film with both great acting and smart writing. The ending is especially well done.

Fargo,"Saw this again recently for it's anniversary, or 4k conversion, - who cares what the reason was, it was just great to see it up on the bg screen again.

Here, she is a pregnant local cop who must deal with a sudden spate of crimes in her magnificently named town ""Brainerd"". William H. Macy (""Jerry"") and the usually under-rated Steve Buscemi (""Carl"") add loads to value to this drama that offers an almost perfect mix of sharp and wittily written dialogue, some clever and poignant performances and a storyline that does border on the surreal at times, but then again we are in Minnesota so is it all that surreal at all? The deliberately staccato nature of the dialogue cannot help raise a smile and a cringe - but that is how it is meant to come across. It takes skill to act like these folks do here, dumbing up and dumbing down to order whilst keeping an eye to a vaguely serious series of underlying plot lines...

Minnesota gets nailed and shredded,"Having seen this film some years ago I used to think it was really good. I watched it again last night, and decided it was actually pretty messy and nasty. Nearly all the characters, with Marge and the bit parts excepted, are unusually unpleasant. The Coens seem not to have enjoyed growing up in Scandinavian America, and have taken revenge on the place. Is it populated almost entirely by dolts, scammers, thugs, bullies, hookers, wimps and so on ? According to the extra feature ""Minnesota Nice"" there is an underlying feeling that ""polite cultures are the most repressed and therefore the most violent"". The Coens put it that way, in any case. In other respects the whole set-up reminded me a little of Blue Velvet country, ten years earlier.The film kicks off with three unplanned killings of innocent people, and then adds to these with three or four more. It would spoil things were I to list them. Marge, who is a pregnant policewoman, then forces a solution to what is going on and arrests the surviving guilty party. She tells him it's a beautiful day. It isn't in fact, since it's foggy and snowy. She ends up in bed with her signally lumpy husband, and tells him he's wonderful. The two of them spend a lot of time stuffing their mouths. There is a curious incident with a mentally disturbed Japanese man. I don't quite know what that's about.

Possibly the greatest film of the 1990's,"The Coen Brothers' screw with the audience from the get-go with their 1996 Best Picture nominee Fargo, widely considered their finest work amongst a filmography that can be compared to that of any of the greats. Claiming this to be based on a true story when it is in fact anything but, the Coen's cement Fargo's twisted and now highly recognisable quirkiness from the first second, only for us to transported into this strange and oddball world of funny accents, eternal snowfall, wood- chippers and kinda-funny-lookin' criminals. In fact, the movie is not even set in Fargo at all. We glimpse it briefly before moving onto Brainerd, Minnesota, where the tremors of a dangerous arrangement are played out with violence and greed.Car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy), in a desperate attempt to make some quick cash to fund a real estate deal, hires two hit men - Carl (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear (Peter Stormare) - to kidnap his wife and split the ransom money paid by her wealthy father Wade (Harve Presnell). With the deal arranged, Jerry makes a final plea to Wade for investment, only for Wade to accept. Jerry tries to call the kidnapping off, but it is too late, and soon enough Carl and Gaear are leaving a trail of murders behind them. With a triple shooting at Brainerd that leaves a state trooper dead, pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is called in to investigate the crime spree.What the Coen's, cinematographer Roger Deakins and music scorer Carter Burwell created with Fargo is a film like no other, where a giant statue of a lumberjack carrying an axe looms over the film like some unconventional deity, and the characters are equally as mocked as they are warmly captured. With their small-town ways and strange, chirpy Swedish-American accents, not many of the characters in Fargo seem to notice the darkness that has crept into their town, and seem content with planning fishing trips, shuffling along the buffet table, or discussing the weather. The accent works like a character itself, a portal into these character's lives. You've most likely quoted ""you betcha!"" or ""oh, geez,"" in homage at some point if you've seen this movie before.Fargo also treads dangerously along the black comedy line, somehow making a man being blended through a wood-chipper hilarious and throwing us off course entirely with Marge's bizarre and uncomfortable catch-up drink with lonely friend-from-school Mike (Steve Park). But the Coen's have always done that, and probably never more successful than with this. The cruelty that the Coen's inflict on the rather loathsome characters seems somehow just, and offer a truly lovable character in Marge, one of the Coen's greatest creations, and wonderfully performed by the Oscar-winning McDormand. This is a masterpiece, a defining moment for Joel and Ethan Coen, who have created a haunting, strange, dark and very funny noir, and possibly the greatest film of the 1990's.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"stark realism, the way I like 'em","Great depiction of how greed and ineptitude can turn a staged crime into a disastrous tragedy.  Well acted and shot, full use is made of the stark, snow filled landscapes of the mid-northern states to the point of surrealism.Maybe the accents were somewhat exaggerated, but the constant use of the 'Jeezes' and 'Yahs' did give a semi-hypnotic effect I'm sure the producers were looking for. It is also very violent, something that happens all too frequently in Paul Bunyan's America.  Frances McDermond was great, and deserves the Oscar she got.  If I can find fault with the movie it is the scene where the 'old friend' tries to con Margie into starting a relationship.  The only possible purpose for such a scene would be to give more depth to the Margie character, but it is mostly distracting.  Some other story device would have been more welcome.Though hard to adjust to at first, I found the musical score to be most haunting and builds brilliantly for dramatic effect where needed.A definite 'thumbs up' from us fans whose tastes lean a little toward the bizzare.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Story based on bad decisions and a series of mishaps,It's a well put together story. But just by no means overly captivating.

For me it was just a series of unfortunate events perpetrated by a number of bizarre criminals of whom I had no real affinity with. Marge was also an obviously capable police officer. And I suppose it was an attempt at comedy to have her being the main investigator. I reckon that the whole mundanity of the scenario and setting in a rural community is why people revere the Movie.

A true classic.,"I am completing my Coen brothers revision with their most popular movie, ""Fargo"", a picture that I've seen countless times in the past and every time feels like new. Joel and Ethan Coen write and direct a dark, gloomy and pessimistic Neo-noir film which casts some of the actors who appear in many flicks by the dyad such as Frances McDormand and Steve BuscemiThere is a touch of black humor in the story of ""Fargo"" and the movie begins with Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Masey), a cars salesman, asking two thugs, portrayed flawlessly by Buscemi and the Swedish thespian, Peter Stormare, to kidnap his own wife in order to take the ransom money. Jerry is involved in massive-scale fraud and he needs cash urgently or else he will have to face the consequences. But unfortunately, Jerry is not built for these kind of endeavors so the plan soon goes awry and blood begins shedding in the small town of Brainerd in Minnesota. Police chief Marge Gunderson (F. McDormand) is the officer that investigates the case of a triple murder, committed by the two criminals who also kidnapped Jerry's wife, Jean. Well, I will not say any more about the plot so you could relish this excellent Neo-noir one-hundred percent.""Fargo"" is darker and gloomier if compared with other Coen's crime films and the cinematography is full of the dull color of snow mirroring the grey sky. The plot moves forward in a steady, rather fast, tempo and there is total absence of redundant scenes or dialogue. It is a tight-plotted movie that counts on its memorable atmosphere, its imagery captured by Joel and Ethan's lens.

But Fargo, of all their movies, has a magic element: if one ignores those amazingly white settings, the dialogue and characters would sing upon a stage. There is a constant flow, even through the 'car salesman' scenes which carries us into the home: to the seemingly neurotic wife and the (always) oppressive father-in-law. Dare one indicate that the script owes much to European theatre? Well, yes.Part of the charm (and one should accept that this is an EXTREMELY black comedy) revolves around the (almost) patois spoken. Oh, ja? OK. MOST of the charm, however, is based around Marge (Frances McDormand), a very pregnant Police Chief who has a mind like a steel-trap! Given that (at least for the males not within her immediate sphere of influence) her femininity and pregnancy would seem to detract from her investigation, she carries all before her. Marge Gunderson is a wonderful role model. What an irony that McDormand won 'best actress', in as much as her character was up against such powerful opposition. Still, I think the best irony was that her husband appeared to be a non-entity (although amazingly supportive - breakfasts, putting up with her snoring, and always a comforting arm) who, at the end of the film, proved to be a success in his own right.OK.

"Excellent, quirky movie!","On rare occasions, a recommendation out of the blue comes along that's spot on. I rented this on the recommendation of the clerk at the video store, and was I ever pleased! When I watch a movie or a play, the first thing I try to do is figure out the story line: what's going on. This one had me stumped for a while, but I finally settled on something out of Shakespeare, and in particular, either King Lear or Richard III. Richard III seemed to make more sense to me: there's enough of Shakespearian blood and gore for most, and yet there are comic overtones that fit right in. I think the writing was brilliant, the score very well matched, the acting superb.If the essence of classical tragedy is that the ending is foregone from the start, then this is classical tragedy. If the essence of comedy is unexpected juxtaposition, then this has elements of that, too. The wood chipper scene is a riot, but you'll have to see the movie to understand why I say that.We watched it on a night when a storm was blowing by: rain on the windows, wind howling, a glass or two of wine.

Dark comedy crime story,"An inept car salesman hires two thugs to kidnap his wife in order to get money from his rich father-in-law. Unfortunately he should have hired better thugs as they end up messing the whole thing up, which in turn causes the local law enforcement to become involved. From that setting we get a crime story worthy of being directed by the Coen brothers, full of awkward characters, everyday situations and hilariously dark scenes of blood, gore and rage.The two thugs, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, are what make this film work for me. Usually cinema tends to depict criminals as violent and lethal people, and these two are that as well, but usually these kinds of characters are not depicted to be quite so out of their depth. It is made clear very soon that while these two may have done these kinds of things before, neither is what you'd call the sharpest knife in the drawer. And they're both so idiotic in their own ways. It's fascinating to watch them live their miserable criminal lives and utterly failing at it. And yet they remain threatening throughout the entire film. Not because they're criminal masterminds, but because they're morons with no moral inhibitions.William H. Macy as Jerry Lundegaard, the car salesman, is also a fun character, who contrasts nicely with the two thugs. He's attempting to become a criminal, but he's even worse at it than his associates and every scene where he needs to pull off any kind conviction about his innocence is absolutely hilarious because well, you can guess.Frances McDormand as Marge Gunderson, the Minnesotan police chief in charge of investigations, has also received a lot of praise for her work. Personally I found her to be a touch boring, though I do admit that my expectations we're a bit too high. She's just so utterly chipper and optimistic all the time that it seems unrealistic. It's a nice contrast to her opponents, but it still means that I didn't find her that interesting. Still, I do like her character on a conceptual basis, and the performance itself is objectively fine. Not just my personal cup of tea.All in all Fargo is a nice watch if you're into dark comedy and can laugh at people being dismembered and people giving into their nefarious impulses. If you've liked any of the other Coen films, you're going to like this one as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Wow............,This was incredible. The Coen Brothers have made some great films. But this film perfectly sums comedic awkwardness with dark violence. This film is fantastic. The actors all did fantastic. The writing and directing by The Coen Brothers is awesome. And this is just a great movie.

Turns out not only Tarantino can make all the bloody stuff,"The story claimed to be based on factual true events; it makes it more interesting to see. The basic premise is a rare one, a lying husband decide to con his way to his father-in-law's money turns out of control and claiming many lives. The story and focus dramatization were developed well; it was able to emphasize the thriller aspect as well as at the same time presenting the quirkiness of the story in the characters. We have a contradicting pair of kidnappers, one a foul-mouthed talker while the other one a calm and silent yet sadistic. On the other side of the story we have the easy-going and spirited policewoman. The acting is quite good that it can take you deep into the story despite all the quirks in the story. Macy and McDormand performed their roles well; they managed to keep me interested in seeing what's next for them.

The Classic Cop Drama...,"Jerry(William H. Macy)is a poor car salesman who goes to the drastic measures of hiring a couple of goons(Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so that her wealthy father can pay the ransom and Jerry can split the profits. Problems strike the plan after a pregnant cop named Marge Gunderson(Frances McDormand) takes over the case. Taking place in a desolate town in North Dakota, one can not begin to describe the brutality of this once peaceful area.The idea of the crime seems so simple but is enforced by the complexity of this frighteningly happy people who are solving the crime. The brutality is given a horrifyingly humorous outlook and makes the movie what it is today. The movie exceeds into the criminals minds and then shows the views of the cop trying to solve the case and the fall guy who is in way over his head. The lighting is absolutely wonderful and really sets the mood with the snowy setting. It gives the movie a dark mood that just scares you when you laugh it. The breath is shown in the air in almost every conversation adding to this effect. The acting was tremendous. I can't and won't even begin to describe the performance of William H. Macy. Overall, the movie is one of those classics that you can admire repeatedly.I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
(n)ice,"When i first saw Fargo it seemed to be very short, which might be attributed to it's 98 minutes running time.

Fargo is considered to be a masterpiece, but i'd name it an above-average movie.

Faddish Cult film,This is undoubtedly a faddish cult film where one is supposed to believe the pathetic characters and bad acting are purposefully concocted and are part of a private inside joke that only the in crowd will get. I was appalled and dismayed to see that it was chosen by the AFI as one of the best films of the 20th Century - especially comparing it to nearly any of the many nonimations that did not make the final list. I believe it has a very time limited appeal that will not withstand the universal appeal and timelessness of a true classic.,1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Blood in snow,"Jerry Lundegaard (William H Macy) is in a financial crisis and he comes up with the idea of cooperating with a couple of wee criminals from Fargo, North Dakota to kidnap his wife and demand his wealthy father-in-law to pay the ransom so he can split the money with the kidnappers. His father-in-law is later shot dead by the abductors because he shouldn't even be the one who go see them. Then they gunned down a cop and two witnesses on the highway- things go inevitably wrong. The heavily pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is in charge with investigating a case about a stolen vehicle, which leads her to a visit with Lundegaard. Gunderson is about to uncover a chain of bloody crimes.'Fargo' is a gripping, dark film and indeed, in a way, it is a comedy because at times it makes you laugh. Frances McDormand and William H Macy were quite brilliant, Steve Buscemi is funny and his quiet partner (unfortunately I can't remember or locate his name) is even funnier.

Fargo,"My brief encounter with the Coen brothers has been reminiscent of a roller coaster. I loathed The Big Lebowski but quite enjoyed Barton Fink. Fargo has given me the inspiration I've been lacking to deepen my relationship with their films. The 1996 crime drama was a fun descent into their take on a ""true crime"" story. Weaving the tale of an inept crime organizer, trying to make his wife better by having his wife kidnapped for ransom money paid by his father-in-law, Fargo captures what it means to live in a town small enough to induce claustrophobia, and how suffocating an unfulfilled life truly is. Starring William H. Macy, Steve Buscemi, and Frances McDormand, Fargo remains an audience favorite from the Coen brothers even 20 years after its release.Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) is a car salesman, working at his father-in-law, Wade Gustafson's (Harve Presnell) dealership, unhappy with his current situation. He has an idea for an investment that he believes his wealthy father-in-law, who doesn't much care for him, will be willing to invest in. Jerry painstakingly goes over all the particulars of the deal with Wade only to be shut out when Wade decides to take the investment on with a partner, rather than give Jerry the initial capital to get it started himself. Devastated and humiliated, Jerry hatches a plan to have his wife kidnapped. It will all work, Jerry believes, by requesting in ransom more than will be used to pay off the captors, leaving Jerry the remaining money to invest how he pleases. The operation should be easy enough and will avoid all the ""messy stuff"" because Jerry is able to get the names of a couple people that will pull the kidnapping off from a man he works with at the dealership. Everything is going to plan until Wade refuses to let Jerry handle any of the particulars, vowing to take over the money exchange himself. Jerry's entire life begins to unwind with that decision as he finds himself in an even graver decision than he was before.On a personal note, it was fun to see William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi in a film together, as I spent a majority of my youth confusing the two actors with the other ( I don't know how, by the way). I spent most of the movie in complete awe of the way it was shot. Great emphasis is paid to mise-en-scene, throughout the film feeling quite claustrophobic when needed, and isolating when the script calls for it. As it turns out, despite the title card in the beginning of the film, not much in the Coen brother's Fargo is actually a true crime story, but as they noted, ""you don't need a true crime to have a true crime story.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
WOW,"This film was wonderful.  I love films where it hits you in one scene.  I thought that the movie was allright until the end in the cop car.  Then it was like WHAM, 7 people died because this one guy wanted to make some more money even though it looked like he lives better then at least 80% of the people in the world.  There has never been a time when ""There's more to life then a little money"" meant so much.  I love the Coen Brothers.  I've seen Big Lewboski, O Brother Where Art Thou, and Barton Fink already and I just rented Fargo along with The Man Who Wasn't There.  I can't wait to watch the latter.  The Coen brothers are pure genius.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not nearly as good as THE BIG LEBOWSKI; a mediocre Coen effort,"This was a merely okay movie which has been blown way out of proportion by the easily swayed and entertainable masses. For me, a movie isn't truly amazing unless the quirky performances are standout and the script is multi-layered and full of twists and turns. This movie is predictable and the performances almost all blend together. People commend Frances McDormand for her performance in this, but I think William H. Macy is the only real show-stealer out of the whole cast, including Buscemi who is underutilized. There are a couple of really good cinematographic shots, such as Macy leaving the office building of his father-in-law when it looks like he is going to jump from the building, either out of disappointment or from incompetence of the plot. The actors all use heavy ""Minnesota accents"" but it seems more like a ploy to make fun of and laugh at people's speech. The detective work done in the movie is at best mediocre, and many of the tangents which the story goes on don't pay off nearly enough. The very end scene is okay as far as tangent storylines go, but the rest are half-in on building any character at all outside of the story. The 90s haircuts, cars, and atmosphere are kind of interesting, but this wasn't intended to be a period piece. The Coen brothers have made quite a few movies, and this one is one of the ones people always say is among their best. I like the Coen brothers' style a lot of the time, but this is far from being as good as The Big Lebowski and is hardly as inspired. From the opening credits' false claim that it is a ""True Story,"" to the ending with the woodchipper, this was a movie you can just go without.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
pointless and offensive,"FARGO is its own worst critic.  Supposedly based upon true events, the plot is glacial and pointlessly violent and the characters are either half-realized or irrelevantly annoying (what do the fantastically exaggerated accents of several characters have to do with anything?) or both, which one presumes is intended to reflect the film-makers' vision of reality.  Fine.  But it's one thing to point out such a vision of reality in a film (successfully accomplished in, say, BADLANDS); it's another for a film to actually BE this vision of reality.  FARGO is a dog-and-pony show, a trick film, intended to make a meta-fictional point by exploiting the film-viewer's pre-supposed moral vacuousness and lurid fascination with sex and violence.  In short, it is not a film of substance and the point is that, truly in the sense which the Coen brothers mean it, only insubstantial, ""half-realized characters"" could be fans of it (naturally, to realize this point is to be ""realized"" and no longer be a fan).  Looked at this way, FARGO is brilliant, but still only in the most menial, kick-'em-when-they're-down sense of the word.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The coolest movie you're ever likely to see.,"The Coen Brothers' opus (and they've made some great stuff - everything from Blood Simple to the Big Lebowski was brilliant) is second only to Billy Bob Thornton's incomparable Sling Blade as a fine example of the cinematic arts.

Simply beautiful.,"The Coen brothers are cinematic geniuses and Fargo demonstrates this genius beautifully. The film blends casual (even mundane) 'Minnesota nice' with the harsh macabre of crime and death.What starts off as a simple crime story slowly adds more layers, becoming increasingly complex as the crime begins to get out of hand. Whilst many films may struggle with such a convoluted storyline, the Coen brothers manage to deal with this in such a beautifully intricate way that prevents the viewer from ever being confused or disinterested but instead the audience can be truly impressed by the Coen's ability to handle such a story and pull it off so beautifully.The success of the film, however, is not entirely thanks to the brothers but credit is also due to the magnificent acting talent. William H Macy and Steve Buscemi both give amazing performances but the true star of the show is Marge Gunderson, played to perfection by Frances McDormand. This film is both great entertainment and beautiful art.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Quirky, sporadic and excellent.","Fargo is an intelligently comedic, violent, emotional, and dark composite that's certainly one of the quirkiest pictures I can ever recall seeing.Prior to writing up this review, I read the comment that Fargo can never decide what genre it seeks to be. Despite my grievances with this comment, I do believe that at times Fargo's various elements could've been integrated more effectively. However, these elements are all accomplished and the overall picture is a commendably smooth venture.In regard to Fargo's black humour, to some extent at times I struggled to conclude which material was intended to be humorous, and that which was intended to be serious and impactful, as the borderline between the two felt slightly blurred.Much like the picture itself, Fargo hosts a plethora of quirky and unique personas, made even more credible by the distinguished efforts of Macy and McDormand.Fargo's intelligence is reflected in it's subtle lines of dialogue, events or shots that mimic or reference similar material featured earlier in the film is consistently used to phenomenal effect.It should be noted that the ending sequence is a commendable and reflective accomplishment that demonstrates how self aware the Coen's were of their creation.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A very realistic must see movie!,"Fargo is a film unlike most films I have seen in my lifetime.  Its level of detail and realism makes the film stand out.  The criminals in this movie do an excellent job playing their parts.  They are the kind of criminal you see in a variety of movies, the ones who blunder because of their own stupidity, but unlike a lot of other movies I have seen, the actors in Fargo make their ignorance seem so real.  Steve Buscemi (Carl Showalter) and Peter Stormare (Gaear Grimsrud) do an excellent job of making their roles believable ones. Sometimes I just wanted to burst out laughing but refrained from doing so because of the content of the scenes.  At the end of this film you'll be asking yourself, `Was this really based on a true story?'  This film is referred to as a black comedy, meaning that what makes the film funny is the way the gruesome scenes are handled in the film.  Overall I'd really recommend this film, unless you have a strong distaste for violence.  There is never a slow scene in the entire film; you'll have your eyes glued to the screen the entire time wondering what is going to happen next.

The Coen brothers are worthy educators of morals of our time,"More and more, I begin to like the work of the Coen brothers. 'Gentlemen's Games' and 'The Big Lebowski' convinced me that the work of the Coens is paradoxical and unlike the work of other directors (except that the detailed dialogues that bring the picture closer to life and the originality of the coverage of crime stories may partly remind us of Quentin Tarantino's style, but only to some extent). I don't know how the brothers do it, but they succeeded in the genre of intellectual comedy, sparkling with unsurpassed light burlesque and 'black humor'. Masters of their craft and more! They skillfully inflate the situation arising from human stupidity to a monstrous absurdity so that no one doubts what the 'moral of this fable' is, and in conclusion they sometimes give out a little moralizing, and we do not consider this rudeness, because this is one of the organic components of an individual, prone to caricaturism, handwriting, which can already rightfully be approved as 'Cohen's'.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Otherwise there should have been a postscript at the end of the film as others do. I was initially intrigued that it was based on true life, thinking that one couldn't conceive such disaster. Now, if that was only a gimmick, then I think it's a cheap one and one that the Coen brothers need not have used. What do others think?

Just my two cents about the movie,"I've read some of the forum posts about this movie (in a board where the public wasn't so greeting) and I saw multiple complaints about the annoying accents, boring story, unnecessary dialogs and so on.I have no clue where does that come from. It seems pretty clear to me that the accent was intentionally exaggerated in a satiric fashion so we get a sense that everyone there is dumb. Therefore I find it fascinating that the female officer whatshername pulled such an extraordinary role in which she shows her wit while being strained by boundaries of her yahs and ohyahs. I really don't understand the negative critics on her (""she acts like she has a stick in her a**). As far as for WH Maceman, I find his looks perfectly suitable for the role (even more than Martin Freeman was who plays a character with an identic personality in the TV show), doesn't he look and act like a real p****? I thought that's exactly what he's intended to do.Also about the dull dialog and story I simply couldn't disagree more. I like that I don't anticipate anything in this movie, interesting action is omnipresent. You can literally enjoy every scene without the eagerness of anticipation for the next one.

By far the Coen brothers' best film,"In case you don't know, the minimalistly-titled 'Fargo' cemented the Coen brothers' reputation as auteurs of modern cinema. There was something about the film which just simply worked. I've already used the term 'minimalist' once and I can't really think of a better word to use to describe the film.William H Macy plays 'Jerry,' a married man in financial trouble. Feeling he has no way out, he decides to hire a couple of unsavoury characters to stage a kidnapping of his wife. During their first meeting, the two 'hoods' aren't as dumb as they may look and enquire as to why he wishes to 'pay his own ransom.' Jerry's idea is that it will be his rich father in law who will pay and the cash will be split between himself and the 'kidnappers.' What could possibly go wrong? Well... quite a bit, actually. I won't go into too many details about what happens (or more importantly all the different ways things don't always work out the way you plan) as that's half the fun. The only thing you really need to know is that there are no car chases and the one shoot out is hardly akin to something you'd see in a Matrix film. The film ambles along from one beautifully-bleak winter's setting to the next, as the people go about their (sometimes pretty shady) business.It's fair to say that Fargo is pretty slow moving. Now, sometimes that comes as a drawback, yet here, it just seems to work. Soon a police officer is on both Jerry and the kidnappers' trail, which brings added heat on everyone concerned. And, in my opinion, this is the film's only drawback. Frances McDormand plays 'Marge,' the local sheriff who starts putting two and two together. It was on about the second viewing of Fargo that I realised what I didn't like about her. She was pregnant. Now, my reason for feeling this way is because Fargo is a pretty dark affair – you won't know who's going to come a cropper at the hands of a madman at any time. However, it's a brave film-maker who dares to harm a pregnant woman. Now, Marge is clearly the only truly 'good' character – she's smart, kind, clever and likable, but, being pregnant, you kind of know that nothing bad is going to happen to her. This, for me anyway, took away a little bit of tension from the 'chase.' But, that's just a minor gripe. If you like your crime films slow and bleak then you'll be one of the many who've enjoyed this. The Coen brothers have made plenty of good films since (and a few slightly more forgettable ones), but this one is definitely their finest hour. And, I've managed to come to the end of the review without managing to mention Steve Buscemi – he's in it too. And, as always, he's great – just in case you needed an extra reason to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Just behind Hudsucker in the Coen Rankings,"Ok, I haven't yet seen all the Coens but most of them and all the well-regarded ones.

It almost plays like a Minnesotan homage to Pulp Fiction: graphic comic violence, exaggerated characterisation, the mundane mixed with the heavy. And it works a treat! And unlike Pulp Fiction's exclusively comic-book characterisation Fargo is anchored by a homely, modest-but-not-to-be-messed-with, believable and totally-charming pregnant Policewoman character. This twist to the 'pulp fiction' format is welcome, gives the film some sympathetic human emotion yet without utilising emotional dramatic clichés like a thousand other crime movies. The film lifts a notch every time she's on screen.Everything else works too: the black humour lands, the scenes are nicely filmed, dialogue is great, acting from all is top: Jerry's shamelessly-fake personality is arguably the most believable characterisation after Marge. The rest are comic-book, and all drawn effectively...you can see some influence on Breaking Bad's characterisations too. It's an effective mix which adds to the slightly-surreal vibe.Fargo doesn't quite have the epic narrative of Hudsucker Proxy but makes up for that with its more colourful mix of scenes & characters. Like Hudsucker it's a strong 8/10 in my book. They rank above the watchable but lower-scoring Coen flicks like Big Lebowski, No Country etc.Not quite a 9+ as those are reserved for the movies which blow me away. The Coens have such a strong signature style, I'd like to see them try their hand at a fantastic-fiction genre: like horror or sci-fi. Could be something special!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Yeah. Oh yeah.""","""Fargo"" is the Coen brother's film of a salesman in Fargo, North Dakota that hires two men to kidnap his wife for financial gain and a subsequent police investigation. The story is said to be based on true events with the stipulation that the characterizations are exaggerated for comical effect. The film has an eclectic mix of drama, crime, humor and black humor. The film is well-shot and has an effective score.The film has solid performances. William H. Macy creates a compelling character as the desperate salesman Jerry Lundegaard. Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are interesting as the quirky yet dangerous as the kidnappers. Frances McDormand also has a notable turn as the no-nonsense and practical yet simple Marge Gunderson.The story starts off well and the crime story generally retained my interest. However, I found that the script got diverted at a number of points and was less effective than it could have been. A prime example of this was the scenes related to the character of ""Mike"", which were unnecessary and distracted from the main story. The film's satire of how trite people can be is clever at points, but becomes tedious with repetition. However, Chief Gunderson's speech toward the end of the film was well-written. Unfortunately I didn't find the quality of ""Fargo"" to be up to its reputation despite its positive points.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

THIS IS NOT A TRUE STORY!,"Such frustration! Fargo being probably one of my favorite movies of all time, I just had to comment on a few misconceptions, misguided comments, etc.1. This is NOT a true story. That text at the beginning of the film was a joke, part of the brilliant, subtle comedy of this film. So, no these people do not really exist. I mean REALLY!  If this hilarious bungled crime actually happened, don't you think we would have heard about it?2. Slow?  This movie is not slow at all. It just isn't quick-cut, tons-of-action-a-minute like the vapid films that make $100 million at the box office in one week. And, at any rate, ever BEEN to Minnesota? Life is slow out there. Perhaps the pacing of the film was mimicking the way of life in the midwest?3. The whole Mike Yanagita thing. Why couldn't the purpose of this whole side-story just simply be to add texture to the film, another layer to Marge's character? Unlike some people who took SUCH issue with it, I didn't mind it at all, and laughed my head off at the sight of an Asian man speaking with a hilarious MN accent. People might think that's ""Non-PC"" who cares. It's called COMEDY.4. Oh, the accents. I dont want to hear it. I work with people from Minnesota, and YES they do talk like that.5. Frances, the Acting Goddess, giving a FLAT performance? It's called S-U-B-T-L-E-T-Y. Please look it up. I know Hollywood doesnt much like subtlety, but once in a while it sneaks in there and the film is better for it.6. Cant this be BOTH dramatic/tragic and comic at the same time? There is no rule that says a film has to fit neatly into one genre! This film IS tragic, it IS dramatic, and it IS very funny. So whats the problem?Oh, yes...

"Giving a birth to rare genre ""A Comical homicide thriller"".","Fargo (1996) :
Brief Review -Giving a birth to rare genre ""A Comical homicide thriller"". Homicide and crime thrillers haven't been more crunchy and lighter than this. Fargo is that rare genre making film which stays in mind for using all cinematic methods far away from Mainstream cinema. A rich plot having so many characters included, having so many incidents included yet meeting each other at the end. A crook hires two professional criminals to kidnap his own wife to get handsome amount from his Father-in-law who despises him. A planning goes wrong by human errors and everything is messed and then how a pregnant and clever cop investigates it is all about interesting story of Fargo. The runtime is short about 98 minutes with no boring moments but certainly has plenty of useless scenes for the sake of entertainment. Comical touch given to the entire Film from characters to situations to the dialogues keeps it engaging. Frances McDormand scores strong merits in her lovable role. All male actors have done a great deal of job in every freaking scene. Joel Coen in Director's chair handles the overall narrative with care but gives away lot of scenes to point a finger on him. I don't really see any logic in that scene when the Pregnant Cop meets her old friend or should i say Ex-boyfriend and suddenly the scene is cut without any clear ending. The next mention comes when she realises that he was a psychotic, well, what difference does that make to her and to the story and to the audience? Comedy is one of the biggest saving grace of the film because such dark stories look bore without humourous shades. Overall, Fargo put up a great show in quick time of 100 minutes and you don't have anything to be disappointed so watch it anytime you feel like watching a crime film in feel-good movie genre.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"worthless waste of time, money, and film","This is without a doubt the worst movie that I have ever seen. Terrible acting, slow-moving plot, and absolutely unbelievable fools for characters (no, this does not make for a better movie. Better movies allow the audience to IDENTIFY with the characters). The only thing that could have given this movie a shred of credibility and humor was if it were based on a true story. But surprise, surprise...it wasn't! The writers/producers took a few creative liberties in this story, one of which was the intro which states that it was based on a true story.Whenever I speak to someone who feels that this was a great movie, their argument for it is typically, ""Well, just think about the context.

Great story-telling!,"I watched it again on tape and enjoyed it as well as in the cinema.  While it never stirs the spirit or moves the emotions that an epic or even a great actioneer can, it so well-done with a minimum of 'movie-magic' that I was left, oddly, with the satisfaction that a parent feels on seeing a perfect score in the kid's gradebook.There are superficial parallels with that great Coen film Raising Arizona (which Frances McDormand also appeared in) in that a kidnapping is the premise for the story-telling, and that Frances McDormand's small fiesty redhead cop character immediately reminded me of Holly Hunter's (who, of course, used to be the Coens' room-mate).  Their partners in both shows are also big gentle slow-witted types, as are the amateurish bad-guy duos. The bleak settings of the Arizona desert and the Dakota winterscape also provide a similar sense of background scale which, hence, enhance the focus on the human element.Fargo is far less self-indulgent in the fantastic humour of Arizona, yet retains the same smart cynicism.  It has an eerily realistic European feel, with the natural acting and absence of MTV-style audio-visual enhancements. It generally ""tells it as it is"", from all the 'nature-of-life' little errors and screwups in most scenes, to the understated closing of the story. It champions honesty, integrity and the simple life, and how a little greed can disrupt the cycle of the good ol' American way of life.Another great movie which Fargo reminds me of is Gorky Park (1983 with Hurt, Marvin and Dennehy), set in wintertime USSR and released back in the days of the Evil Empire, albeit with a different slant, but with a similarly peaceful bleakness in the feel, backdrop and moral-of-story.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"FARGO : Funny, Authentic, Rare, Great, Original ...","""Fargo"" is one of these cinematic rarities for which the word 'original' has been invented. Never had a movie plunged me in such a unique atmosphere, and never will another film do. I respectfully salute one of the greatest cinematic creations, and I use the word 'creation' as this is one of a fistful of films that cannot be categorized. And this is the true cinematic accomplishment of ""Fargo"", while many acclaimed films relied on homage to other classics, the Coen brothers made a masterpiece out of nowhere, out of the middle of nowhere, only drawn from their memories, a vast territory unfairly snubbed by cinema, somewhere in Minesotta.We're not in New York City, in Los Angeles, in the Death Valley, this is Paul Bunyan's territory, a flat region with a Siberian kind of winter that paints the landscape in such a blinding whiteness you can hardly see when the land stops and where the sky begins. It's a place that is unfamiliar, almost exotic to us, efficiently providing a memorable cinematic escapism. But the setting is not ""Fargo""'s only signature, the greatest strength of the masterpiece relies on the characterization, which comes part from the script, and part from the acting. In fact, when you keep the cinematography in mind, you realize that ""Fargo"" is one of these jewels where everything immediately penetrates your memories. That's why ""Fargo"" was rightfully regarded as a classic almost as soon as it was released.The characterization is what gives ""Fargo"" its color, its touch of authenticity. It's a movie dedicated to the spine of America, lost between two coasts. The film made me wonder why this particular place has rarely been used in films and I guess part of the answer comes from the film itself. These are towns where politeness and simplicity are significant aspects of the culture, ""Minnesota Nice"" as they say. In the film, even the smallest characters welcome you with a shining smile compensating the sunless sky. They all are polite and hardly let a ""F' word slip from their tongue, even hostility is hidden behind politeness. This is the austere, simple but respectable culture of the habitants, mostly descendants from Scandinavian emigrants as it's implied by the consonance of their names, Lundergaard, Gustafson, Gunderson, Grimsrud, and that heavy accent, these ""Yeah"" that sound like ""Yah"". The accents are the music that accompanies the rhythm of the film in an odd but so appealing way. The limit between authenticity and caricature is very thin, but it works because the laughs are never aimed at people, but at the situations they're going through.And speaking of situations, the setting is quite ironic as if it's specifically in these areas where violence is repressed, that it has to explode in the most vicious way. The movie is supposed to be based on a true story, but we all know it's more a kaleidoscope of the craziest and most memorable situations that impacted the Coen brothers, the debate is pointless anyway because the movie still invites us to contemplate one of the most pointless and tragic criminal affairs, initiated by Jerry Lundergaard, the Executives Sales Manager of a car company. William H. Macy portrays with perfection one of the biggest cinematic schmucks ever, a man so in need of money, he'll elaborate an incredibly stupid scheme by asking two criminals to kidnap his own wife, so he can get the money from his ruthless father-in-law. The two men are Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud, played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stomare, their relationship is driven by the ""talkative and stoic-guy-who- hardly-speaks"" classic but efficient dynamic. How these guys could work together is mystery, but they must have their reasons. Anyway, from the first minutes of the film, the mission is marked by the sign of incompetence. Whatever Lundergaard tries, he fails miserably, whatever he touches is doomed, yet he never gives up. The movie disturbingly oscillates between laughs and shocks, but both are used spontaneously: it never feels forced, and helps to assimilate the absurdity of what is happening.But the movie could have never been praised with such enthusiasm had it focused the story on Lundergaard, Showalter or Stomare. The genius of the Coen brothers is the creation of Marge Gunderson, one of these impacting and memorable characters like only Cinema can provide. Her seven-month pregnancy gives a nice touch as it helps to root for a woman carrying life while investigating a horrific case of brutal murder, and makes so authentic and touching the famous moment where she feels nauseous, while watching corpses  just because of morning sickness. But she's not only a good and sweet woman, she's also very competent. She's the heart of the film, and her investigation is the Shakespearian journey into the world of simple people in their everyday lives with their flaws, their secrets, their kindness and sometimes their lies. Marge's sweetness probably relies on the perfect solidity of her marriage. She and her loving husband, Norm, exudes love and harmony that compensate the overall cynical tone of the film, a way of showing that these simple people, overly smiling, are authentic and admirable in their simplicity, and at least, they're happy the way they are. This austere simplicity is beautifully conveyed by the nostalgic and emotional score of the film that I immediately associate with this world of simple people, profoundly attached to their roots, and who have in their hearts the warmth lacking outside.""Fargo"" is an original, inventive, beautifully written, film inhabited by a poetry that leaves you stunned at the end. And I'd like to thank Roger Ebert, as the one, who convinced me, from his ecstatic review to give the movie a second chance. I'm afraid to admit, that I didn't like ""Fargo"" in the beginning, but it takes one second viewing to get the genius of the film. You betcha!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Probably would have enjoyed it more if I watched it before the show.,"This movie is still great but I feel the show, specifically season 1, built on the themes and ideas of this movie fantastically and improves them.

Pulp Fiction is a thriller that we could compare, an id rather watch that most times.

Master piece and Coen's best by far,"This is one of those rare gems that I can watch over and over and never get tired of. So many fun characters an d a superb plot balanced with amazing real-life characters and dialogue that isn't so plot and exposition heavy.You get truly normal real-life conversation with some drips of plot, enough to make it seem totally real and still move the story along.Although some people think some of the scenes weren't necessary, they actually were. For example, Mike Yanagita meeting Margie seems like a trivial scene, but when Margie finds out Mike lied to her with such ease she realizes that Jerry lied to her and goes back to confront him. So not only was that scene hilarious it was the catalyst for solving the crime.This is by far Coen Brothers' best film. The subsequent films tried to copy its success, like the Big Lebowski. They just haven't been able to capture the magic of Fargo since, despite a few decent films.List of best and/or worthwhile Coen films:1. Fargo.2.

Twisted story with unlikable characters,"The Coen brothers consistently give us great cinema. And they give us movies that aren't just good, but memorable. While this film isn't their best, it definitely comes off as disturbing and memorable. Even though the opening credits state that all events in the film actually took place, the entire film's plot is fictional. Which works well in the Coen bros favor. Making us get more invested in characters and events that took place.The Coen bros greatest strength has always come from their script, and this film is no exception. The writing and directing work perfectly together. Even without any huge actors, each of them give good performances, although I don't know about the idea of Midwesterners being this weird. I realize the Coens grew up in Minnesota so they have first hand experience but the accents were kind of overdone, and at times made the characters come off as stupid. With that being said I really enjoyed what Frances McDormand did with her character. She comes off as really the only likable character in the entire movie. And truly deserved the Oscar she received. William H. Macy was good as well but near the end I wanted to punch him in the face.I wonder what the T.V series will be like. If they go the route of remake I don't think it will work, but if you just say it's within the same world the Coen bros created, then I think it works great. I am glad to hear the Coens are at least producing. Maybe have the series take place in Fargo this time?Back to the film, I think it's a re-watchable film because of the dark humor and impeccable writing, even with the sudden violence.

So, he hires a duo to kidnap her (the duo is probably the best of the year by Steve Buscemi as a wisecracking killer, and Peter Stormare as a un-talkative killer) and eventually kill her.

A Very White Noir,"Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) hatches an ill-conceived plan to have his wife kidnapped, and use ransom money shelled out by his wealthy father-in-law to finance his solo business venture. Human stupidity ensures that every single element of the plan fails catastrophically.Fargo marks the Coens' acceptance by the mainstream. The award nominations showered upon it and its widespread critical acclaim may have set high expectations from viewers, whom, upon inspection shrug in disappointment, failing to find either the verbal gold of Big Lebowski and Miller's Crossing, or the visual wizardry of O Brother Where Art Thou and The Man Who Wasn't There. Of all their films, Fargo might be the most palatable to mainstream sensibilities, but that does not diminish its qualities as a film.In technical terms, this marks their first collaboration with cinematographer Roger Deakins after regular DP Sonnenfeld left to pursue a directing career, and it is quite a leap from the stylish tones of Miller's Crossing to the controlled, washed out landscapes of Fargo. Just as impressive, but more understated, the sign of artists fully coming into their own and confident in the key ingredients of their product. The screenplay is a work of art, the verbal sparring and control of language beyond peer, and like the world's greatest orchestra, the cast perform this symphony to perfection.Macy is hopelessly fascinating as the least capable man in human history, and Stormare and Buscemi team up as the weirdest kidnappers ever to grace the screen. People cannot seem to lavish enough praise on Frances McDormand, and it is true that she allows a beautiful character to blossom beyond expectations. The Coens' one concession to mainstream audiences - a likable, grounded protagonist - is one of the most original main characters in cinema.Like all their films, it adds up to so much more than you might think upon first viewing, and serves as an ideal starting point to explore their work. A classic!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Money,money,money and money","Fargo leaves a lasting impression, exposing the dark underbelly of the American Dream. Jerry Lundegaard's ""small"" scam, which begins as a seemingly harmless plan, quickly spirals out of control, leading to a tragic series of events. The film masterfully depicts the deep voids in the lives of ordinary people and the extreme lengths they might go to to fill them.Marge Gunderson shines as a beacon of light within this darkness. When she asks, ""And all for what?"" we, too, are prompted to reflect: Is all this violence, bloodshed, and pain just for a few dollars? This question forces us to confront the selfish side of human nature, while Marge's warmth and moral steadfastness remind us that hope and innocence still exist.Throughout the film, the bodies buried in the snow symbolize the internal decay of each character. Jerry's seemingly insignificant scheme reflects how fragile and dangerous the American Dream can be. How easily our ""small"" desires, ambitions, and self-interests can lead to catastrophic consequences.Fargo also scrutinizes themes of family and love. Jerry's greed jeopardizes his family's safety, while Marge prioritizes her loving marriage above all else, showcasing the clash between two very different worlds. The quiet, ordinary love shared by Marge and Norm stands as a refuge amidst the film's dark and cold atmosphere.In conclusion, Fargo brilliantly illustrates the chaos lurking beneath ordinary lives, the dark sides of human nature, and the epic dramas that can unfold even in the smallest towns. It challenges the viewer to reconsider what truly matters in life and helps us find ourselves as we search for innocence amidst the darkness.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Family values film,"To me, Fargo, is the Coen brothers ""family values"" movie. Who really comes out happy in the end? Marge and her husband. They have an untraditional marriage with Marge as the stable breadwinner and her husband the artist, but seem blissfully tho' undramatically happy(Read: ignore the TV ads and just live as if there were no media by which to judge oneself). Gunderson's father-in-law undervalues his son-in-law, who lives down to his expectations. I got the impression that the father-in-law's disapproval causes Gunderson's actions more than Gunderson's actions caused the F-i-l's disapproval. People do tend to rise or fall to meet our expectations. Gunderson places less value on his family than on success at any cost, as does his father-in-law, who undercuts Gunderson's idea and co-opt his project. He has no concept of caring for another person's self-esteem and giving the other guy credit where credit is due. For christ's sake, this is his daughter's husband and the father of his grandson! Marge's old high school friend is devastated by life, and in the hotel bar we see Marge flustered for the only time in the film. Why? Because dysfunction is a mystery to her. Marge, Midwest solid, does her job, supports her husband's artistic ambitions (and is rewarded when his stamp design wins the contest), earns the close-to-the-vest respect of her Minnesota peers, catches the bad guy with little drama/melodrama, and all while 50 months pregnant! Talk about affirmation! Life is good if you value what's lasting and true - family values - and do your best. In the prowler in the end, we see Marge confused by the motivations of such as the thugs. Goodness cannot conceive of dysfunction/evil,nor understand the dysfunctional/evil. (One exception to the theme might be the poor sod who gets blown away doing his job working the parking garage. God is unpredictable.) Blessedly, though I am a Texan, I was living in St. Paul, Minnesota during the first run of the film and got to experience many local's reactions to it. I believe the movie is a paean to the values I found to be quite pervasive in St. Paul and in Minnesota-generally. Also the ambiance in the movie was so evocative of my experience of Minnesota winter. The weather IS trying to kill you. One must stick to the basics to just survive. Another insight: Macy plays his character as though he were an eight year old boy - his blundery lies, his naive attempts to exit the window and hold onto the door jamb when being arrested, etc. Watch his performance with that in mind. An actor has to have something to ""play"" and I think that's what Macy does with this part.All in all: what a fable and morality play for our times. One of the best films I've seen - and I've seen 'em ALL!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""You're darn tootin'!""","This is arguably the first film that really put the Coen brothers on the map and for good reason. Everything about Fargo is unique and original, from the beautiful setting to the incredible dialogue mixing together humour, drama and beauty so seamlessly the film is nothing short of a masterpiece.Fargo's story revolves around how several characters lives begin to collide with one another after a simple kidnapping scheme begins to go wrong and body counts begin to rise. But where the film really succeeds is because of the interesting range of characters ranging from McDormand's kind speaking Marge to Buscemi's rude and talkative Carl. All the leads of the film have original and interesting personalities that make them so interesting to watch.Part of the brilliance of this and every Coens Brothers film is that even the small characters feel very well developed. Someone like Norm (McDormand's husband) probably has somewhere around 5 minutes screen time, but in that short time it gives him a unique personality and demonstrates the close bond between him and Marge.It feels that everyone in the film matters or has some role to play, with every character having some impact on the chain of events. A single conversation can change a character's entire outlook of a situation which the Coens make believable through the great writing where we can see why they would be changed by the confrontation.On top of this the film has many moments of both natural and memorable dialogue. Some of it even packs great meaning such as ""There's more to life than a little money, you know. Don'tcha know that? And here ya are, and it's a beautiful day."" Lines like this demonstrate the Coen brothers skill in creating great meaning in their work whilst maintaining realism within the dialogue.Beyond this the film contains many beautiful and meaningful shots mixing a feeling of suspense into the endless roads and blank landscapes that fill the screen. Even the simplest shots of a car driving down the road feel all the more impressive as we see the sight of the headlights shine through the falling slow.The Coens constantly do what all filmmakers should, which is to take risks and try different things. Everything from the setting to the characters personalities is unique within the film. From start to end Fargo is a joy to watch and a true cinematic classic.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
My favorite Cohen film.,"This movie has got to be one of my favorites in my collection. The Cohen brothers always make good movies but this one in my eye definitely takes the cake. The script is gold, so very believable and hilarious. Every single actor in this movie played their parts so well I think H. Macy really did a great job as well as Buscemi.This movie is about a man who needs money so he tries to scam his rich father in law to pay a ransom to two men he hired to kidnapp his wife. The kidnappers hit the road as Jerry is put under more and more pressure.This movie is not only my favorite Cohen films it is in my top ten. Everything about this movie is as close to perfection as you get if you haven't seen this movie go watch it right away.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
tremendously entertaining,"Of all the Cohen Brother's tremendously entertaining movies, this is the best. This is the one that they will be remembered for. William H. Macy plays Jerry Lundegaard, a man in a spot. He's a used car salesman that has been securing loans for cars that are not really in his lot. The bank is calling in the loans, threatening legal action, and he needs money fast. He forms a plan to have his own wife kidnapped, thereby splitting the ransom money between himself and the kidnappers. It's a terrible plan, and it quickly unravels into a bloody mess of murder and betrayal. When bodies begin to mount, a local police officer, Marge Gunderson, is called in. Frances McDormand plays Marge Gunderson, and she makes the movie magical.McDormand won an Oscar for the role, and this is one instance when the recipient deserved the award. She plays ""Margie"" with a huge dose of humanity. She is a character that sneaks up on you. When she is introduced, you wonder if perhaps she is just a small town officer in way over her head. She is pregnant, speaks in small town (Minnesota) idioms, and throws up from morning sickness when investigating the first brutal murders. She seems more like a nice, Minnesotan housewife than a cop. But early you get the feeling that there is something special about her.The killings involve a traffic cop that was killed while issuing a ticket for a missing plate. In his log book, he was written DLR. When Marge's fellow officer says that he has run a search for all tags starting with DLR, Marge says gently, ""I'm not sure I agree with you 100 percent on your police work there, Irv."" She explains to Irv that DLR means that it was a new car, a dealer's car. ""Oooh"" says Irv, staring into space. Then Marge tells Irv a joke about the guy that couldn't afford a vanity license plate, so he changed his name to FGS1135. ""That's a good one,"" says Irv, but it is clear Marge's wit has gone over his head.The brilliance of the scene is that Marge is never cruel or condescending to Irv, never thinks less of him, and is not making fun of him. She is simply enjoying her own intelligence, and we can see the very private sparkle in her eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Very well-made, and yet something's missing...","I liked ""Fargo."" It is a very good movie, with a great deal of originality and spectacular performances by Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. McDormand definitely deserves her Oscar, although it's a bit tragic that Macy didn't get one, since he gives the better performance (although I emphasize that both performances are spectacular). The film also presents an interesting contrast, with complications, violence, and sin on one side, and simple folksy down-home humanity on the other. It is this contrast that makes ""Fargo"" difficult to categorize. Crime plays a central role in the story and yet it's not a crime story, thriller, or mystery. The scenes with Frances McDormand are laugh-out-loud hilarious (and she is a true master of the art of awkward smiles for awkward moments), and yet the film is not a comedy (not even a black comedy). It's a different kind of film altogether.And yet, I can't quite join the critics in calling this ""one of the greatest films ever made"" or ""the best film of 1996"" or anything like that. It is a very good movie. The Coen brothers are talented filmmakers. But, when I watched ""Fargo,"" I felt like something was missing. I can't quite put my finger on what, though. There's just some je ne sais quoi that's missing from this film.Maybe I felt like the link between the violent plot and the comedic plot was not strong enough, that they were connected, but not strongly enough. Maybe I thought the movie was driven too strongly by the characters and not enough by the plot. I usually love character-driven stories more than plot-driven ones. (The character-driven films of Martin Scorsese, especially ""Taxi Driver,"" are probably my favorite films). Yet, maybe I was looking for a bit more plot in ""Fargo."" I really don't know. But there's something that's preventing ""Fargo"" from being one of the greatest films of all time, and I don't know what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

My favorite Coen film of all time.,"This my favorite, and the best Coen film of all time. Even though it's a fairly simplistic story, it has comedic elements of all sorts. Frances McDormand as a pregnant Minnesota cop investigates homicides that are connected to a family man hiring hit-man to kidnap his wife to collect the ransom money from his rich father-in-law.The story is told fairly straightforward, with extremely funny jabs at Minnesota culture, particularly on their accents. The funniest is the jabs at Steve Buschemi being described as nothing but funny looking, really goes to show how the Coens feel. William H. Macy as the husband of the kidnapped woman is a nervous mess in every scene he's in, going out of his way to cover up anything that goes wrong. Steve Buschemi is an absolute riot every time he's on screen, being a bumbling screw up in almost everything he does.This is the best Coen film because it is not only a comedy, but it's a comedy of different varieties. If you tried to explain why these scenes are funny, you couldn't because they're that clever. Very recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The prototype of an excellent thriller!,"At the beginning this film reminded me on Sam Raimi´s ""A Simple Plan"" which I had seen before and which is also worthy to watch, but very soon ""Fargo"" develops its very own style. The story is about a quite harmless conspiracy that ends in a total disaster. All happens in a small dump called ""Fargo"", that is snowy and idyllic, where you couldn´t expect anything evil. But the Coen Brothers take a look behind the facade, a view into the depths of the human soul. It all starts with a kidnapping action that finally leads to five senseless murders. It´s a film about cheating, betraying and killing. At last you´ve got the unpleasent feeling that something could be wrong with your own neighbour...  This movie is a brilliant mixture between thriller, drama and satire. There are some macabre/funny scenes in it (when Gear ""disposes"" his companion Carl) and a lot of peculiar characters, what is usual for the outputs of Joel and Ethan (watch also ""The Big Lebowski"" and you know what I mean...). Of course, ""Fargo"" is casted with the obligatory Coen-staff, that contains Joel´s wife Frances McDormand, Peter Stormare and Steve Buscemi who´s stealing the other ones show. Perhaps some people might find this movie dull: ""Fargo"" is no film with big talk and 10000 dead per minute... You have to pay attention on the subtle humour and the little subtleties in it. Take this advice - and enjoy ""Fargo""! (9/10)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A black comedy with heart,"The Coen brothers are obviously skillful filmmakers, but it wasn't until FARGO until they revealed themselves as true artists, with something very valuable to say about the human condition.From the opening shot to the end credits the Coens unfold their story with uncharacteristic confidence.  A car drives through the snow to a haunting violin anthem.  An awkward man meets with two criminals and asks them to kidnap his wife.And the rest of the movie lives up to these first scenes, combining a cold filmmaker's eye with a real human heart.  FARGO has what a lot of other Coen films are missing: sincerity.  BLOOD SIMPLE, MILLER'S CROSSING, THE HUDSUCKER PROXY--they're all skillfully made and very unique, but really cold.  Here, they've found the perfect balance--a satire of small town Midwestern life, a cool noirish plot, but some really devastating characters.Jerry Lundegaard, for example.  The guy's funny, but desperate, and you actually feel for him.  But most of all in Margie Gunderson and her husband--wow, what a great addition to an already great film.  Marge's a good person without being boring, and through Marge's eyes, the Coen's cold, ironic take on most stories is redeemed.  In the end, FARGO is a film that does more than just impress.  It moves the audience, ends up being an experience that they will never forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Fargo,"I feel nobody is smart in this movie. It is different from the crime movies that I have been watched. Normally, they usually have the main character who are smart and fight with bad people. I think the director tries to make the movie is funny by using stupid manner of characters. However, many scenes are cruel, especially the scene that the man kills the police, and many scenes are unpredictable; for example, the scene that kidnapper looks through the window and breaks it out and comes to the house to kidnap. In addition, there is an example of overlapping sound in the scene that the man tries to fix the television. In that scene while the man is fixing the television, the camera is zooming in, and when the television is good, the camera zoom out, but it becomes the different place.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This is possibly the most sincere film I have ever seen,"It is not the most realistic criminal romp ever carved out, but there is an underlying and even fundamental sincerity in its gallery of supporting characters and in the fumbling folksiness with which they interact in the chilly north of Minnesota. 'Fargo' is the reason Roger Ebert loves movies so much. Although I do not share his same gushing love for the film  or indeed, for the Coens  'Fargo' is so well-written, well-acted, well-executed and well-condensed that I find no tangible reason for why I should not feel this way about it.The title 'Fargo', much like its story, is misplaced. It briefly opens in Fargo, North Dakota but soon plunges into the barren, frigid smalltown of Brainerd in Minnesota, capturing the chill atmosphere of the setting with effortless conviction, probably because the Coens grew up in these North woods. Here Joel Coen directs and Ethan produces, but with deft, personal pen strokes by the both of them. They apply the same meticulous familiarity to their characters with Frances McDormand and William H. Macy in the front row, two smalltown people so heartwrenchingly sincere they completely carry the film.William H. Macy is a push-over car-salesman with financial difficulties who resorts to hiring two sleazeball, violent but fumbling criminals to kidnap his wife to blackmail his domineering father-in-law. A talkative, neurotic and ""funny-looking"" Steve Buscemi and a hard-edged, strong-silent-type Peter Stormare (my country's finest export, for sure) botch their way through this kidnapping heist, killing three people in the process, which raises the stakes and sets Frances McDormand's tough (and 7-months pregnant) cop character Marge after them. She is an apt and no-nonsense chief, and one hell of a genuine, likable and cheerful character  quite possibly the best role written for a woman  rightfully earning her an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.Macy was also nominated as Best Supporting Actor and it is a crime he did not win it. Here is a pathetic and realistic middle-aged small-town car sales executive, under the thumb of his father-in-law and desperate for a little bit of money to gain some dignity. Macy's performance as Jerry Lundegaard is unspeakably emotive and had the Coens chose to, he could have carried Fargo all the way to the end by himself. As it is, there is no need for it. The Scandinavian names all ring true to me (as a Swede) and the local jargon is pleasantly peppered with ""oh jeez"", ""dern tootin'"", ""ya"", ""you betcha"" and ""d'heck do you mean?"". This is the Coens in their own element.'Fargo' is a black comedy but it is never laugh-out-loud worthy, except in one of the early scenes in which a shocked Steven Buscemi exclaims ""Oh daddy!"" after Stormare has killed a cop in the heat of the moment. Most of the humour in fact stems from the underlying absurdity of the situations and the depth of its characters. It is probably an apt conclusion to draw that its success stems from the very same things.8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"An essential Coen Brothers film, and essential in general.","Fargo is a modern classic film that I implore many film fans to see.Fargo is one of the best written stories ever to be put on film. The story maintains a certain style throughout and this style is effective. The dialogue is plain, mundane, real, but maintains a certain ridiculousness. Of course, this is a trait that the Coen Brothers are known for. But in Fargo, it is shown in full form. The contrast between the characters accents, mannerisms, sensibilities, and their current situations is hilarious. This is how one does dark comedy. Take a story that still works if put in Los Angeles or New York and place it somewhere a bit outlandish yet relatable.Most of the other technical aspects are solid. Most aren't too impressive, but are obviously a step above most films. The score is great as well, keeps the audience tense and is fitting to the story. Of course one can't talk about this film without mentioning the acting. Everyone plays the part well, even down to Scotty Lundegaard. Especially Frances McDormand, who had an absolutely phenomenal performance. She's strong, funny, and brings a lot of life to the film.

"A good caricature of the white Midwest, but with a fly in the ointment","Fargo is a satire of the blankness and bleakness of the American Midwest. The movie is set as a crime story, but actually the Cohen brothers are poking fun at the monotonous, unimaginative, and humdrum life there under veneer of well-to-do. The thing is that the brothers are Jewish, and they were concerned that the white populace there would take the movie as what it really is—a social commentary on the goy way of life. Hence the solution, which is a racist solution—As a sop, create a nerdy and contemptible character and cast a colored person for the role, and balance it out. The Cohens picked an Asian because Asian Americans do not have an NAACP and would not picket the movie or create a ruckus unlike the blacks would have. That is why an Asian appears out of the blue in a movie set in Minnesota where less than 1% of the population is Asian. In other words, in a perverse way the Cohen brothers chose a racial solution to the political-correctness problem of their own movie. The dastardly solution speaks volumes for the Jewish brothers' essential cowardice, despite their apparent claim for making a social statement clothed in a crime story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

even better than you've heard,"""Fargo"" seems to be drawing flak lately; I think it's part of an anti-Coen backlash. The brothers have been serving up heavy doses of irony and dark humor for years, and some viewers are getting tired of them. Still, that's no reason to retroactively criticize their masterpiece, is it? Yes, the film has a very queer sense of humor, but if things like the Minnesota accent drive you nuts, you're not getting the joke (BTW, this doesn't mean that you're stupid, just that you don't share the Coen sense of humor!).I usually hate ""funny"" gore, but I do think that the violence here, though occasionally ""amusing,"" is also quite horrible and repulsive. So, it's not quite like a Tarantino film then, where violence becomes a supercool thing to emulate. What ultimately distinguishes this film from a Tarantino effort - and indeed, from the Coens' other films - is that it is, in the oddest way, sentimental. McDormand's character lends warmth and humanity to a story that is otherwise quite cold and detached. Her presence makes ""Fargo"" accessible, even if you're not a big fan of black comedy, and her ""normalcy"" elevates this above even ""The Big Lebowski,"" which is a great movie as well, but also too much of a freak-fest.Enough apologies - this is one of the best films of the 1990s (surprise surprise, it didn't win Best Picture!). The photography is gorgeous, and the icy landscapes lend so much atmosphere to the proceedings. The script is fast and snappy without seeming artificial, and the acting is across-the-board great; Buscemi's comic role is often overlooked, but in fact he may give my favorite performance.

Love for your wife and/or husband, for your children, parents, other relatives an close friends is always more valuable than any money. The main man in the film, Jerry Lundegaard, was able to organize an act of kidnapping his wife with two gangsters in order to get half a million US$ for him and another half for the gangsters. The result was fatal at all, his wife and father-in- law killed by the gangsters and he himself discovered and caught finally by the police. This Lundegaard had no ethics, no love for anyone including his son, and no brain at all.

Heck Ya Mean?!,"Fargo opens with the message that it is ""based on a true story,"" and closes with a retraction that its ""persons and events"" are fictional. ""True story"" is a joshing dramatic contraption, obliquely causing us to accept certain elements we might not normally accept so easily. Regardless, Fargo is concordant with the intonations and distinctions of modern small-town life. When Chief Marge Gunderson stands at the first crime scene and counts three dead bodies, she accurately recognizes that the culprits are not from Brainerd. Endeavoring into the city on her inquest, she asks a friend for a tip on a good place to eat, and is guided to the Radisson buffet. Jerry Lundegaard is as boxed in by his sales manager's job and his cruel father-in-law as any inmate in a jail cell. He's shuffling a stolen car and a double fraud. His son hurtles off from the dinner table to meet his friends at McDonald's. His wife toils manically at every domestic chore, chopping, stirring and knitting with as much rapidity as she's capable of. Against these homegrown nuances, the crimes protrude as brutal and barbaric. There are unpleasant parts. Everyone recalls the scene with the wood-chipper. More cold-blooded is the scene where the poor hostage, blindfolded and barefoot, attempts to escape on foot in the snow, and Carl Showalter makes fun of her. There are also the shootings, callous and abrupt. Against this Chief Marge, seven months pregnant, applies cozy small-town buoyancy as a way of ferreting privileged info out of crooks.Our introduction to Marge comes far into this atmospheric and genre-less film. The crime aspects are at this point engaged. We've met Jerry, the auto sales executive with a ridiculous scheme. We've met Carl and his laconic, merciless accomplice, both memorably played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare, who have settled for it. These are eccentric, off-kilter, incomparable characters, yet when things lose control and Marge and her husband Norm are presented is when the movie unearths its heart. Marge Gunderson is one of a sprinkling of characters whose names always abide in our recollections, like Travis Bickle, HAL 9000, Walter White. They are totally, daringly themselves in stories that rely upon exactly who they are. Lacking all the fetishistic glamour of other Hollywood policewomen, Marge is the chief in Brainerd, Minn., continues to have periods of morning sickness, inhales all the processed, frozen, prepackaged, canned food she can get her hands on, speaks in a Minnesota dialect where ""yeah,"" pronounced ""ya,"" is showered like a motto. She's a born cop, really sharp. Although one might find the lack of response by the State Police to the murder of one of their own highly questionable, at the crime scene local police chief Marge nevertheless promptly and efficiently deduces what occurred, and discerns there were two killers, one big, one small. Her partner, not so nimble, doesn't catch on that ""DLR"" signifies a dealer plate: ""I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work there, Lou."" There is a scene some people seem to think baffling between Marge's first and second interviews with Jerry, when she has dinner with a high school classmate Mike Yanagita. It's a disquieting hiatus that, when it comes to motif---a forlorn guy lying hysterically, failing to mask his anxiety---weighs in as pivotal. Mike functions as an echo of Jerry, and the dinner scene works like the connector between Marge's first and second interviews with him. The next morning, she is about to revisit Brainerd when a high school girlfriend tells her that everything Mike said was a lie. That's the alarm bell that compels her back to Jerry, and is somehow superior to the recourse, a single interview with Jerry that just swelters him out.William H. Macy's performance is a cave-in of dread and agitation. Here is a man who just wants one thing: a $750,000 loan from his affluent father-in-law, so he can purchase parking lots and make some of his own money. His office's vertical blinds are used visually like prison bars. If he can steal the money, he can buy the lots. Yes, his wife will have to be abducted, but he'll have to be big about that. He knows nothing about the kidnappers, and lawyers are hounding him all day for data that would reveal the missing car. And there's Marge, sitting across his desk, bright and sprightly, asking him questions he cannot answer. Macy wilts, his smirking grin a cringe, his restraint like a nerve clasp, and things cram him further in.The snow and cold endow the Coens with cinematic reference marks and an inescapable feeling of location. The opening shot fades in to Jerry's desolate venture to transfer the car with a haunting folksy Carter Burwell score. High-angle shots reveal two frosted parking lots, which the Buscemi character curiously decides to boost license plates and make a ransom exchange. When Jerry struggles to satisfy a discontented client, the goofy man and his wife have their goose-down coats amusingly heaped in their laps. The frost and gloom oppress everything, and in the middle, in their snug envelope, are Chief Marge and Norm. The Coens have been said to gibe their characters, but their affinity for Marge generates the healing power of Fargo. Marge is the spark plug, alleviating grief and mending law and order. As a result, this might be the warmest film the brothers have so far made, and no less exceedingly ripe and uniquely engrossing than their other works.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"No strong female lead, no Frances McDormand, no Fargo success","Fargo was well-written and conceptualized. Possibly the Coens' best work.The fearless and razor-sharp Frances McDormand deserves her award win and more.A male lead would have totally skewed the story.Only a female lead, who's pregnant, who is SO naturally portrayed, could make the story work.Overall, Fargo is engaging, suspenseful. There's some in-ya-face gore, though not of snuff film quantity like those featured in No Country For Sadistic Old Men.My rating = 9 merit stars - 2 pointless-gore stars = 7 stars.Hollywood continues to treat such strong female lead as a detour from the male lead ""norm"".

Manipulative to the audiencebut not how you think.,"It's hard to deny that the vast majority of cinemaAmerican or otherwiseis going to be ridiculously overrated by a certain group of people. When that group is the actual American population itself, a lot of negative reviews like to label the said film as ""The most overrated movie of all time!"" The fact is, no matter if you or I like a film or not, almost everything gets more recognition than it deserves in America. Average movies are stretched out into ""modern masterpieces"" simply because of the utter lack of creativity or originality in cinema overall. It's much easier to force yourself to feel contentment in something you just wasted your time and money on than admit it was terrible. It's a common misconception to ""look for the good in every film"", rather than actually admit that you've seen/heard everything the film showed so many times you almost feel asleep or lost interest and made out with your girlfriend for 3/4ths of the movie, then call it a great film just because the critics did. Everything I just mentioned above could be the reason Fargo is so overrated. But if you want me to be honest, Fargo is so downright pathetic, no matter how hard I try, I can't figure out why it's overrated. At all. I just don't understand it.I've seen reviews calling Fargo everything from the best movie of all time to a Shakespearian masterpiece. I read their reasoning, and I found it flat. I've watched big-name critics rave about Fargo, but even they failed to give a real reason it was so amazing. Basically, they all come down to: ""Fargo was average, sure, but the humor gave it some life."" And if that's the best they can think of, by their own logic, SpongeBob should be rated alongside The Godfather.Based on a true story or not, there is nothing even remotely worth watching in Fargo. It has the same exact plot as you've seen on bad TV crime drams before, and it unfolds in exactly the same way. What's the point of making a movie about a true story if it's exactly like the countless fictional stories just like it? Fargo has no originality, and next to no creativity. Sure a few lines of dialogue are decent, but who really cares? Reviewing an entire movie based on a few lines is ludicrous. The dialogue and humor both aren't even that great. If anything, it reminds me of a severely watered-down Pulp Fiction wannabe.Likewise, the heavy use of nostalgia is the sole reason this isn't playing on the women's channel instead of being called one of the best movies ever made. The Coen brothers rely heavily on nostalgia and soft-spoken characters to give off the faux sense of seeing something you haven't seen before. I always hear people calling a movie ""manipulative"" or ""and insult to my intelligence"" due to a plot twist or something that they didn't see coming. Though I usually find those types of people unintentionally hilarious, I'm going to go as far here as to say that Fargo is manipulative to the audience: it uses nostalgia to mask that it's really a dull, hollow shell. The plot is completely throw-away. A guy pays to have his wife kidnappedand weren't we all oh-so-shocked when that went wrong? For once, I'd like to see a movie where something like this goes RIGHT and everything thereafter plays out exactly as planned. That might be interesting. Fargo, however, takes the boring, safe route and does exactly as expected of it. By the closing credits, I literally asked myself out loud: ""What was the point?""I think I figured out the point. The point the Coen brothers were trying to make was that you could make the most typical movie ever, add a couple funny lines, and they'll be basking in wealth because of it. They probably even had a good laugh at the level of positivity regarding their pathetic film. Because, really, no one tries to find the faults in films anymore, just the good in everything. May I suggest that this is why we're watching Fargo and not a truly original, captivating film from these two skilled directors? If you love their crap, they're not going to waste the effort making gold.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""There's more to life than a little money.""","A typical car shows up in a world of snow. That is how one of the best-written movies of the last 20 years opens. The movie that earned the first Oscar to Coen brothers and made F. McDormand into an international star. Besides, S. Buscemi and P. Stormare performances should not be forgotten either. Fargo is a story about pathetic man's pathetic plan to gain some money. It is set in Minnesota in the middle of the winter. Coen brothers are not afraid to play with genres so it is hard to tell if Fargo is a dark comedy, crime drama or something else.The movie begins in a typical bar where from the dialog between pitiful Jerry Lundergaard (W. H. Macy) and two criminals (S. Buscemi and P. Stormare) we are given the context of the story. Jerry tells that he wants to get his wife kidnapped so that he could get some ransom money from his father-in-law (H. Presnell). The deal is set and the story sets off. As usual, in Coens movies, nothing goes according to the plan of characters and the story falls into absurdity. Firstly, kidnapping ends with a three cold-blooded murders and the start of murders investigation. This is there Marge Gunderson (F. McDormand) gets into a picture. She guesses everything right from the start and shines among other foolish characters (""I'm not sure I agree with you a hundred percent on your police work, there, Lou""). From this moment, the story splits into three parts – investigation by Marge, pathetic Jerry's attempts to fix everything and hilarious relations between criminals. These parts come to one only at the very end of the movie that is both funny and thoughtful at the same time.One of the most significant things that made Fargo successful is the character of Jerry Lundergaard. Jerry probably is the most pathetic man in the whole movie. He is wrong in every possible way and it seems that he cares about nothing but himself (he even forgets how this kidnapping scheme will effect his son). Firstly, he works in his father-in-law's car dealership and is a lousy salesperson who sells cars by telling lies to customers and family life is no better – it seems that the true head of the family is his father-in-law. When he gets himself in some financial problems Jerry is so afraid of telling it to his father-in-law that he is prepared to steel money rather than ask for it. In addition, he even practices his speech before telling his father-in-law about the kidnapping. As the story goes further, criminals, Marge and father-in-law press Jerry more and more until he brakes down. However, there is one scene in the movie when we can see some humanity from Jerry. It is the scene there Carl Showalter (S. Buscemi) threatens to kill not only his wife but his son as well. Jerry impulsively tells to leave his son away from this and he seems to be very serious about it.Another thing to mention is a hilarious screen couple of S. Buscemi and P. Stormare. They are total opposites of one another. Carl is an annoying ""talky"" type hothead who does nothing right while Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) is a cold-blooded professional who prefers to act rather than speak. Carl seems to irritate Gaear in every possible way from blabbering about the silence of Gaear (""Two can play at that game, smart guy"") to an inability to deal with unexpected difficulties (""I'll take care of this""). It is hard to imagine how these two characters became associates.To sum up, Fargo is a well-written and well-acted story about very interesting and complex humans that makes you laugh and cry at the same time and in the end, we are left with a conclusion said by Marge – ""There's more to life than a little money."" These words perfectly sum up the entire movie themes and help to characterize characters by dividing them in to those who do and those who do not agree with Marge's words.2011-05-19",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Is This True?,"Fargo is an adaptation of a true story, which I can't really believe because of its absurdity and weirdness.All of the characters are very unique and different from each other. We all thought Jerry was the main character, who is extremely sickening and has no real will at all. As it turns out later Marge is the main character and she is a lovely person, who loves her husband very much and does her work effectively and successfully. The other characters are also very interesting and unique.There are some outsanding acting performances starting with Frances McDormand, but my favourite was William H.

Just alright,"""Fargo"" is the quintessential Coen Brothers film, but also their most overrated. It's a quirky dark comedy that essentially sees a cinematic crime story performed by ordinary Midwesterners. We are so used to the dramatic conventions that films follow to the point that realistic characters end up looking goofy and awkward. As usual with the Coen Brothers, plans are made to go wrong, the characters who act cinematic have no credibility whatsoever, and those who are down-to-earth end up looking the most cinematic.It's a film full of memorable, meticulously constructed scenes and unique characters, yet I wouldn't call it a masterpiece. In particular, the humor relied a bit too much on the accent and didn't always click with me. There are also a few dull moments like the Yanagita scenes that brought the pacing of the story down and were not even that funny.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Highly recommended,"Haven't seen the movie in a long time. I don't consider it a masterpiece like many others, but I think it's a great movie.

All make the movie great.Wonderful atmosphere (combination of location, score, cinematography and direction), great cast and direction.John Carroll Lynch's character (Norm) and his relationship with his wife. It's so innocent, loyal, natural and low-key. I also love Peter Stormare's character. Again, low-key with minimum dialog. He's one of the main villains, but looks so innocent - like a kid at times.

Oscar-Winning Writing Based on  a Lie to their Audience,"The premise of this screenplay begins with a lie to the audience; at the beginning of the film, a somber title comes on saying that ""due to respect for the survivors, names have been changed in this film"". This implies that the events of the film are true, and that the writers are showing respect.Neither of these two things are true. The Cohen Brothers, after winning the Oscar for Best Writers (not before), eventually came out and admitted the story was entirely fictional. So much praise had been heaped on them, that no-one seemed to care at that point.It would be great of newspapers worked the same way. Bush would never have been criticized when no WMD's were found.Why does this matter, and who cares at this point?When I first saw this movie, I was disturbed by the way the kidnap victim, the mother, was portrayed: as comic relief. Her running from her kidnappers was comical, the way she was shown running around in the snow with a bag over her head was comical, and even her death (her skewed legs upside down) was shown as comical.The son, however, who was terrified for his mother, was not shown comically. So here we have a screenplay where the writers showed a terrified victim as comedy, and the son's terror for his mother dismissed. If this screenplay had been based on true events, to say this was disrespectful both to the mother and the son is an understatement. Imagine being the son who survived your mother's kidnapping and murder, and seeing her portrayed in this way.But that's OK, because we find out later the whole thing was fictional. Except for the fact that I wasn't the only one upset by the way the victims were presented; other people, in particular victims rights groups, were too. Then we find out that we had been jerked around, that it was all a fiction.Does that make it any more acceptable? Imagine your favorite movie that moved you because it was based on true events; then you find out years later it was all done so you would buy a ticket, and you had been deceived. This is what the Cohen Brothers did to their audience.Good writers? Sure. Ethical people? You decide.But respectful of their audience and to murdered people?Apparently, not very.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Brilliantly conceived and (joke) executed.,"The storyline of this dark comedy drama has been gone over many times in other reviews so I won't labour on about it.Suffice it to say that the overwhelming feeling of biting cold creeping into every part of the characters' bodies is brilliantly expressed. The multiple killings are leavened with a homely - Minnesotan - humour that somehow brings the whole movie together in a way that is typically Coen Bros.The actors worked with dialect tutors to perfect the Minnesota accent to such effect that some of the dialogue is quite difficult to follow yet, strangely, this doesn't matter. The laconic way of talking interacts with the stark landscapes and reinforces the coldness which is so much an integral part of the movie.The acting is almost consistently excellent: my one reservation is William H Macy's portrayal of the lead (anti)hero which to me just slightly off the mark in one or two scenes: I couldn't put my finger on why I felt that way and it isn't a real criticism of the movie as a whole.Bottom line: first class, a movie to watch again and again (As I have!)",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Black comedy is a one of a kind sort of film...lots of shivers along with the laughs...,"FARGO is a rare kind of film that has you hooked into the story of a kidnapping that goes wrong and ends in a series of gruesome murders--and at the same time, it works beautifully as a black comedy.Principal reason for the humor comes from FRANCES McDORMAND and WILLIAM H.

You won't know whether to laugh or cry.

The true story that is a true story.,"The Second movie directed by Joel Cohen ""Fargo"", is a story of a terrible husband who intentionally put his wife up for ransom may not have been a true story but it is an entertaining and at times intriguing watch nonetheless. Jerry Lundegaard(Played by William Macy) is a poverty stricken car salesman who devised a plan to have his wife Jean Lundegaard, (played by Kristin Rudrüd)kidnapped and held for a million dollar ransom to make a quick buck from his father in law(played by Harvey Presnell). All according to plan until the ""funny looking"" thugs hired by Jerry (played by Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) out of sheer incompetence, murder a police officer who pulls them over and two ordinary people passing through who where at the wrong place, at the wrong time. The best part of this film has to be how the movie intrigues with each turn of events in the story that only increase the tension between the viewers and the main character jerry, as his whole plan comes crashing down on him especially when he learns that his ransom will have to be raised to 80,000 to compensate for the unnecessary deaths. Not only that but he also has to worry about the intrusive police officer Marge, (played by Frances McDormand) investigating the triple homicide. The only shortcoming of Fargo have to be the simple dialogue, the almost static camera angles and little character growth but overall, Fargo is a stellar movie and well deserving of the cult-appeal it has received following its initial release in 1996.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

This Is One Bloody Funny Movie. Sher Is. Yaaaaah!,"OK. So this opens with a claim that it's based on a true story - supposedly actual events that occurred in Minnesota in 1987. But it turns out that the Coen brothers (directors Joel and Ethan) were lying. This isn't actually based on true events, although the Coens claim that the movie is actually a kind of composite story, weaving together strands from various cases. Usually, that kind of dishonesty would bother me, but in this case it was a relief. Frankly, this is a very violent and bloody movie - and yet at the same time it's also very funny. To be honest I'd have been upset with myself for being so amused by a movie that featured so much carnage if it actually had been true!The story revolves around the kidnapping of Jean Lundegaard (Kristin Rudrud) - the kidnapping having been planned by her husband Jerry (William H. Macy). Jerry's in some sort of financial bind - although it's never really explained what the bind is. He needs money, and to get it he arranges for his wife's kidnapping so that his wealthy father-in- law will pay a ransom, which will then be split between the kidnappers and Jerry. Problem solved, with nobody really being hurt. But things go horribly wrong, people start being murdered, and everything spirals completely out of control. Finally local police chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) gets involved and starts putting the pieces together, while everyone involved gets more and more frantic.This is well paced, violent and very, very funny at times. The characters are given life by a very talented cast (McDormand won an Oscar for Best Lead Actress.) Much of the humour revolves around the portrayal of the local dialect in Brainerd, Minnesota.

Tight screenplay congruent with attempts at keeping plot grounded in reality.
Lack of blaring or opportunistic background score, augmenting the authenticity of the events.
Plausible performances especially by McDormand and Buscemi.
Veridical characterization bringing out palpable emotions of contempt, anger, frustration, despondency and hustle.The Mediocre:
Underwhelming humor for a crime flick.
Lack of investment in character development.
Moderately inadequate gore and under-utilization of Stormare's baleful character.The Bad:
Indolent and static camera work. Typical of 20th century movies.Overall:
A recommended movie only if you're a fan of true crime or caper genre. Not for the average desi movie buff.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A very solid, well-made Coen brothers film","Fargo does a great job of both capturing the midwestern attitude and creating a realistic drama. The acting performances and script are excellent, making all scenes feel realistic. No parts of the movie blow you away, but basically no mistakes are made and everything serves a purpose. Character-driven with a suspenseful enough plot, Fargo is a solid movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Incredibly mediocre film for Academy Award Winner,"I must say that I cannot for the life of me figure out why people think that the movies made by the Coen brothers are so great. I have seen numerous comments that another of their films is ""the best movie ever,"" and that movie, which I will not name, is even worse than this incredibly mediocre movie! I think that the Coen brothers put out in-your-face, insipid garbage. I have no problems with silly movies, in fact I like to suspend my disbelief for any movie that is done in any kind of clever way, but their movies really demonstrate how movies can fail to challenge the viewer even to suspend disbelief! Well, my disbelief is the praise their movies get.""Fargo"" is about a kidnapping scheme that is badly bungled from beginning to end, but the real bungling is again the total artlessness of the way the story is put together and acted out. And as I wrote above, the biggest ""entertainment"" are scenes of murder and violence that are totally in-your-face. The day is saved by a pregnant police officer, who is so sweet and kind, we just know that she will get her man. Yet neither her portrayal nor any of the other portrayals of people from the Great Lake states are very effective. It's not that they aren't accurate, because they are, and this adds to the boredom of the movie - they almost never express emotion, they never get out of their ordinariness, neither when people are brutally murdered nor when one of the officer's former male friends has personal problems. No, life goes on for these people regardless, and what is entertaining about that banal sameness? Finally, the portrayals in the movie are just too cute, at least for me.What makes a lot of movies work is that their characters have transformations, they learn something from their experiences, they go from bad to good or vice-versa, or undergo some kind of change. And that is yet another reason why this movie fails in my opinion, after all the murders and other actions, no one learns anything at all! The man who arranged the kidnapping learns nothing, the murderers learn nothing, and life just goes on as it was!",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Quite superb,"Some terrific performances from a stellar cast.
Typical Coen Bros servings but each of the four series tells a different tale of murder/mystery/intrigue.

Genuinely hilarious,"The Minnesota thing is priceless. I lived in Minnesota for almost one year. The not-so-subtle Minnesota accents are a bit over the top but not by much. I suspect that the directors took it up half a notch just to underline the hilarity of ""Minnesota Nice."" It really is a bona fide phenomenon that - surprise, surprise! - you can only find in the state of Minnesota. Each character - major or minor - is well-plaid. Her pregnancy, the relationship she has with her husband is just so....well.... Nice! It makes a great foil against these two criminals and the hapless husband of the kidnapped wife. Macy is sooo good at his part as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the better and more underrated films of the 90's. An interesting and thrilling crime caper that's holds your interest and it all turns out for the best in the end!,"""Fargo"" is clearly one of the better films of the 90's probably one of 1996's best. As always I learned with each film I've watched from the Coen brothers even though most of their plots are a little offbeat they still entertain and hold interest. As evidenced from watching this film it proves even ordinary people anywhere can finds themselves caught up in crazy things that involve unexpected twist and turns yet somehow it all solves it's self in the end.Set in the great northern united states mostly taking place in a small Minnesota town it involves William H. Macy as a desperate car salesman who wants money. And he will do anything even if it means arranging a crazy scheme to have his wife kidnapped so he could get ransom money from her well to do father. And that's just what he does when he contacts two stone cold thugs(one who's played brilliant by Steve Buscemi who enjoys having sex with truck stop prostitutes and escorts on the side!) from Fargo, North Dakota to travel to Minnesota to kidnap his wife. As with any Coen brothers movie it gets interesting as the drama comes in the most unexpected ways the plan goes not as planned as then a crazy game of chase and phone tag develops.Enter the wild card and key element of the film as her character added such common ground and normalcy in a fantastic and blazing performance Frances McDormand is very memorable as the small town Minnesota deputy who investigates. As you really feel for her character she's so plain spoken like most in the film with her north mid western draw accent she's also pregnant yet she continues to fight hard on the investigation and come thru and break the case open like breaking ice on the cold Minnesota lakes.Overall ""Fargo"" is a film that holds your interest the whole time as it's blended so well with suspense drama and dark humor that thrills it just makes you think just like so many other Coen brother films. And the performances and chemistry of the cast is super it just proves ordinary people can find themselves twisted up in crazy things only to all have back to normal in the end. Really a unique film that's memorable and very good.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Good, but not sure if I would call it great","I haven't seen too many of the Coen brothers' films, in fact, the only ones I've seen apart from this one are Intolerable Cruelty and The Man Who Wasn't There. This one didn't hold my attention like The Man Who Wasn't There and it didn't make me laugh as often as Intolerable Cruelty. It was quite funny at some points, no doubt about that, and often it was far more funny than most other comedies... but too many of the jokes seemed to be repeated over and over. The pregnant lady eating, the locals saying 'yah', William H. Macy's character stuttering or throwing a fit... I don't know, it seemed like the Coen's couldn't think of enough good jokes, so they just repeated those they had over and over. Some of the jokes are insanely funny, though. Most of these come from Steve Buscemi. Just about every scene he's in, he steals the show. When he's not on screen, you're usually somewhat bored. One thing I also found myself getting a bit annoyed over the things left unresolved, and the scenes that seemed pointless. There were several characters in the film that could easily have been written out with no change to the overall product, apart from making it move faster. The plot is good, original and full of clever twists. The pacing is somewhat good, but too much of the film is boring. Like I said, Buscemi saves every scene he's in, but it's often boring in scenes not involving him. The acting is good, for the most part. Frances McDormand gives a great performance. The rest of the leads are all credible. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is good, and at times great. A pretty good Coen brothers' film that could have been better. Too slow-moving and repetitive for my tastes, but definitely worth a watch, especially for fans of Steve Buscemi. I recommend it to fans of the Coen's, Steve Buscemi and the other principal actors. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"I like all the Coen brothers films, but...","Like all the other Coen brothers films, this is crafted with expertise (well, at least that kind of expertise distinctive to their style) and makes for good entertainment, but -- purely aside from the artistic merits of the film -- it isn't what I consider their MOST entertaining movie.  The first time I saw this, I considered it pretty good thriller-entertainment, but not as spectacular or amazing or all that extraordinary as the critics seemed to think.  After the second time through, I figured the same thing.  Finally, after some more cinematic maturation, I watched it a third time, and basically think the same thing.The story is based on real events (warning: I may not be particularly drawn toward movies based on real events, as they strike me as too journalistic for the medium, but that may be one of my idiosyncracies); it is particularly appropriate for a Coen brothers film because of the way the events transpire.  It revolves around a real slimeball's attempt to ""solve"" his monetary crises by having his wife kidnapped and held for ransom, and the money then funneled back to him.  Of course, what makes it all interesting is how things get increasingly screwed up and gruesome as the story goes on.  The Coen brothers obviously embellish events and characters with their own quirky twists and mannerisms -- e.g., from the slimy but incompetent maneuverings of the husband, to the cheery-and-cute-but-very-smart cop (played by Frances McDormand), to the criminal duo of the whiny tactician (Steve Buscemi) and his sullen but very dangerous sidekick (Peter Stormare).It's most definitely better than the usual action/thriller/mystery flick, though that by itself doesn't say a lot.  My impression is that the Coen brothers put together a film that for them was pretty ""standard"" but happened to hit it on with a lot of viewers and critics; they were probably as surprised at all the attention as I was.  It's pretty middle-of-the-road for fans of the little genre that is the films of the Coen brothers.  For Coen brothers films that I both liked a lot and regard as ""distinctively Coen brothers"" (come to think of it, is there any movie they've made that isn't?), I recommend _Miller's Crossing_, _Barton Fink_, _The Hudsucker Proxy_, and _The Big Lebowski_.  (I am more mixed or undecided when it comes to the others, which includes _Fargo_.)All in all this means at minimum that it's well worth watching at least once, but not a ""must buy.""  On my scale, that's a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"The winter is well portrayed, the characters insufficiently so","Being Swedish, I know of winter. I have come across it in Wisconsin, too. Fargo portrays it well. The snow, the cold, the sort of pause mode it puts on life - and the human struggle to break out of it.The tempo of the film is kind of Scandinavian, and so is the acting - not only from very experienced Peter Stormare, who worked extensively with Ingmar Bergman on the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theater, years ago. There's a constrained mood on all the acting, reminding me of the Bergman ideal, also making the characters quite realistic.What happens in the movie seems pretty much unavoidable, in great accordance with the drama ideal cherished by Aristotle. That is very interesting, since it's a story from real life. So life follows the laws of drama? At least when interpreted by the temperament of artists.There's a significant element of parody, too. A burlesque. What makes me hesitant, is that the balance between parody and realism is not set, not consistent. How the characters speak and react, that's close to farce, while their actions and the plot itself - that's very much realism, or naturalism, to use a concept from the art of literature.That is probably the reason for the actors not being able to sum up their characters and lead them to a proper end point. For just about all of them, when they have their last scene in the film, they are in limbo, not rooted at a point where events and their character would lead them. It's like they wait for the real ending.Well, maybe this is an epic, not a drama, but if so, it gives so much a pretense of drama, there is no room left for the epic to flourish. Nor is there sufficient room for significant characters in the story to be exposed.Another half-hour or so might have solved it. Maybe the film was too drastically treated at the cutting board.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Incredibly boring and annoying,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought it was going to be an epic thriller with a good ounce of mystery to it and considering it's in IMDb's top 250 films of all time. But having now watched it all, I'm now really confused as to why so many people like this film to begin with and thought it was a big let down. Apart from a few scenes of felony, the majority of the movie was incredibly boring and the acting was dreadful, most of the characters were really annoying and forgettable, the character of Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) is perhaps the most annoying character in the film, will you just quit saying ""Yah"" already... Apparently the movie also has some elements of comedy but it's all so poorly executed and it just wasn't funny at all.I honestly think that this is a very overrated movie that's so poorly written, just don't bother with it.

William Macy and Francis McDormand's characters are in my mind two of the greatest characters ever developed for film.

The Coen's mainstream breakthrough is still one of their best.,"The Coen brothers movies thrive on irony so it's very apt that after their attempt at a big Hollywood picture 'The Hudsucker Proxy' flopped they went the opposite way with 'Fargo' and it turned out to be their breakthrough into the mainstream. Because this movie was such a popular success it's easy for long time fans to overlook it while praising lesser known Coen classics like 'Miller's Crossing' and 'Barton Fink'. But the thing is 'Fargo' deserved the success because it's a very fine movie and still one of the best things they ever did. I've seen it four of five times and every time I do I slap my forehead with a ""hot damn! this is GOOD!"". The acting in 'Fargo' is almost like a master class, especially from Frances McDormand and William H. Macy. McDormand is of course married to Joel Coen and co-starred in the brothers debut 'Blood Simple', but her performance as Marge Gunderson, one of the nicest cops in cinema history, really made people sit up and take notice. This is Macy's only Coen movie to date, which is a shame, because he relishes dialogue and they come up with some of the best since Macy's mentor David Mamet. Steve Buscemi also gives a comic gem of a performance as an inept kidnapper hired by Macy. It's no surprise that the Coens have worked with him so regularly, he's just great. I always say that my favourite Coen brothers movie is the most recent one I've watched, so that means this week it's 'Fargo', a brilliant movie that shouldn't be missed by any film buff. If you've seen it before, watch it again. It's the kind of movie which deserves repeated viewings.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Truth is Stranger than Fiction,Fargo is one of those movies that are simply unforgettable. Coen brothers have made many good movies but Fargo is one of their biggest achievements.

The outdoor shots in this movie are simply breath taking and the landscape has been captured in a very captivating manner. Strong performances by most of the characters is also one of the big strengths of this movie and the music certainly enhances the overall impact and appeal.

It was all going so nicely...,"This film is a fine, fine, piece of cinema from a couple of the neatest, slickest and most original directors in the business. Only one thing stops it from claiming its rightful place among the industry's finest - that makes it a great film rather than a classic film - and that's that it's too damn short! Admittedly, it doesn't cut you off with the same degree of frustrating incompletion that, say, 'Unbreakable' does, but to compare the two films at all would be insulting to the Coens. All the same though, the style and quality of the film just makes its brevity all the worse. Frances McDormand turns in one of the finest acting performances of recent years as the just-too-damn-smart detective, and the whole film is staged superbly - the Coen brothers' creation of a very dark movie in a very white setting is slick to the point of arty, but engaging enough to become too over-indulgently picturesque. The film is neat, clipped and wonderfully aesthetic. The comedy is as dark as it comes, but all the same entertaining - you find yourself laughing out loud at stuff you might feel you really shouldn't; it's more of an atmosphere of set-piece humour at times in the film, rather than anything deliberately comic about the script. So hey, maybe I'm being slightly picky about criticising the abrupt end to the film. Maybe it shouldn't really be any longer - perhaps to be longer would be to be make 'Fargo' less well-formed, and that would be unforgivable. I suppose it's just a personal thing - as a tragic product of the MTV generation I was hoping for a more dramatic ending, though the classic 'disposal' scene certainly added a certain uniqueness to the film, though it would be shame if such a fine work were to be remembered for just a woodchipper. Again coming from an MTV-generation point of view, I suppose the one thing this film lacks is a feeling of suspense, an adrenalin rush of some kind. But then a film doesn't need that sort of thrill factor to be good. This is not a film you see if you want the kind of high-octane entertainment that, say, 'Bad Boys' or 'Terminator' will supply. Having said that, I can think of few people who would crack open the beers and watch 'Schindler's List' with a pizza - this is a film treat, an artistic, phenomenally slick and polished work with a well-picked, select cast that features not a single wooden line, and along with McDormand's masterful performance there are fine roles by Buscemi and Macy as the cuss-filled crook and the chirpy-to-the-point-of-irritating loser car salesman who hires him. A great lesson in how to make a film - the plot is very simple, but the way it unravels, as well as the style of the piece as a whole, make Fargo a winner.

Hi Hon. How was Fargo?,"I love this film. Sometimes I watch a movie over and over just for the acting. This is one of those movies. The casting was right on.

He hires these two bungling idiots to kidnap his wife for ransom. His wealthy father-in-law is supposed to put up the ransom money. He has an inflated ego and says ""Dammit. I want to be a part of this"". He wants to personally deliver the ransom money in hopes of not actually having to part with it. Jerry keeps uttering the same question. ""What the heck do you mean"" and you realize he doesn't have a clue. Buscemi wants money, conversation and sex.

Margie, Frances McDormand, wants her husbands artwork to be on a stamp, to have her baby and to solve a crime. She eats her way through the entire movie. Oh yes, there is the snow.

And from their other films, I have walked away feeling good.In Fargo, however, I was bored and in anticipation of something great. That ""great"" never came. I thought Frances McDormand was decent,William H. Macy increasingly nervous, but I felt the real excitement was brought to the screen by Steve Buscemi. A staple of Coen Bros. films, he brought such explosiveness to the screen. He should have been nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar, b/c he does just that...he supports a film that i felt would have otherwise fallen flat on its face. As i said, though, Fargo did have some great parts, like all of their films do. The hotel room fight between Shep and Carl(Buscemi's character) left me laughing and in awe. The same goes for the confrontation on the parking garage between Carl and another character. So, in conclusion, Fargo decent...Steve Buscemi excellent.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Perfect example of the ""dark comedy"" genre","The first half of this film plays like a comedy. It's very funny in a dark kind of way, especially the deadpan comments of the two crooks and the perfect timing of the direction. Then, all of sudden...BAM...the smalltwon sheriff is graphically shot in the head. You then find yourself saying, ""Wait a minute...that wasn't very funny."" The movie just gets more interesting at that point, especially when we are introduced to our hero...a pregnant police chief named Marge. Huh? It's neat how this film shows us a thriller played out by simple smalltown folk. William H. Macy does an excellent job portraying a man who is frustrated and can't seem to get a break. And even though he's about to have his own wife kidnapped and scam the hired thugs out of millions of dollars in ransom money, his humbleness and frustration causes us to relate with him, and we feel sorry for him (until the end, at least). The film reminds us all of a time in which we had a good thing planned out and going good for ourselves, only to watch someone else ruin it for us. And on a final note: The accents in the film, although funny, are greatly exaggerated. Many people who live in the region are embarrassed and offended by it. But guess what? Movies have been doing the same thing to people from the South for a long, long time (Watch any movie that has a Yankee actor using a ridiculous ""southern accent"").

My favorite movie,"After reading a lot of reviews, I agree w/ what a lot of people have to say. Fargo is a great movie.  It's insightful and the extremes in life -good v. evil- are portrayed perfectly.  I don't love movies like a lot of people do, but I LOVE ""Fargo.""I don't like wasting my time on movies that don't give you insight and make you think about things a little more.  TV can waste my time fine for non-issues.  Fargo is not on the level of a blockbuster in terms of action, but in terms of insight and quality, it is the best.For those that say it was overrated, maybe that's because they're expecting a mega-action movie.  Nothing about Fargo is mega because it's so true to life.  The extremes in Marge and Norm (extremely nice, genuine) and extremes of Jerry, Carl and Gaer (extremely evil, greedy, calice) do exist in real life and sometimes it's as boring and obvious as in Fargo.Fargo is not for everyone.  Some people like to have things in your face. It is my favorite movie of all times, hands down.  This is the only movie where I think every scene is so brilliant that it can be interpreted to have higher meaning and significance.  It should have won Best Picture, but of course it didn't spend enough advertising $ to promote the movie, so that would corrupt the whole Hollywood industry.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
I'm not gonna debate you...,"This darkly comic tale from the Coen brothers is arguably their finest piece of work to date. They apply their trademark quirky style to the not entirely original plot of a car salesman who arranges his own wife's kidnapping in order to get the ransom money from his scrooge-like father-in-law. However, the simplicity of the plot allows you to concentrate on the most important part of the film, the carefully crafted characters, each with their own idoesyncrasies that make it a delight to see which strange creation will appear in the next scene.These are perfectly realised by a fantastic cast of actors. While credit must go to the ever-dependable Steve Buscemi as the bungling kidnapper and William H. Macy as the salesman full of frustration and impotent rage, the best performance is by Frances McDormand, who deservedly won an Oscar as the heavily pregnant sheriff trying to solve the crime. The only main female character in the film, she is surrounded by a succession of increasingly more pathetic men, from her househusband, to an old school friend who still lives with his parents. Even the crime itself lurches from one disaster to another as events conspire to make a seemingly straightforward kidnapping escalate into a multiple homicide. The unfamiliar location of Dakota provides some great backdrops and spectacularly barren vistas and the snow somehow adds to the absurdity of the whole situation. Also adding to the comedy element are the unusual local accents which are seemlessly adopted by the cast and if you don't find yourself mimicking a Minnesotan for a few days after seeing 'Fargo' then you really ought to visit a doctor to see about getting that funny bone removed, it's obviously not working right.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Doesn't even crack the Coens' top three,"Fargo is a very overrated movie.I've seen Blood simple, Raising Arizona, The Big Lebowski, and now Fargo, and I have to say, the first three win big over the last. What I like most about Coen movies is the originality - look at the crazy biker guy in Arizona, or the climax in blood simple, or the the entire movie in Lebowski. Their movies are stunning and ahead of their time.Fargo, on the other hand, is not. In fact, the script lies down so flat it's hard to believe that someone actually made this movie... it simply didn't need to be made. I have to give credit for poking fun at the north midwest - I was born in North Dakota and moved to Rochester, Minnesota and then St. Paul before heading East - but that just doesn't make this a good movie.The premise (guy hires thugs to kidnap his wife and he gets the ransom) isn't original. The criminal hi-jinks (kidnappers shoot everybody and anybody in their way) certainly aren't original. And please, Frances McDormand's character might just be the biggest cliche in the entire movie. Good cop gets the bad guys in the end. There wasn't even any suspense, nothing went wrong... most of the entire movie was predictable. And even though McDormand delivers a fine, fine performance, she's only in the movie for fifty minutes or so!The Coens' unmistakable touches on the film are what save it for me. The humor, the accents, the situational irony are superb. But they can't save the plot, which is just too ordinary.Overall a 6.5 or 7 out of ten, for fine cinematography, a very good score, the realistic accents, and the great ensemble acting. And any movie with William H. Macy in it deserves a good rating, IMO.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Coen brothers' best,"The twisted Coen brothers Joel and Ethan made a good movie here, so good it's ranked #84 on the American Film Institute's 100 best films list.William H. Macy is a car salesman who plots to have his wife kidnapped so he can collect the ransom. Unfortunately, the nitwits he enlists for the kidnapping are both nuts and one is a bona fide psychopath.As with most Coen films the plot is a Rube Goldberg contraption where whatever can go wrong does go wrong. Macy is sucked into a surreal situation. Frances McDormand plays a pregnant police woman who investigates local murders and eventually gets involved in the plot.Fargo is part very black comedy and part horror film. The film is really good at mixing the very mundane everyday life of Frances McDormand with the extremely twisted lives of the kidnappers which gives the film a real scene of menace. There is a scene at the end involving a wood chipper that is really unsettling. Steve Buscemi is unforgettable as one of the bug-eyed kidnappers.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You should see the other guy!!,"The Coens really deserved all the accolades they received for this, as it's among their best efforts.After all the critically acclaimed, commercial disappointments they've produced, it was nice to see them break through and triumph in both areas for once.This movie will certainly stand the test of time, as I recently watched it again and enjoyed it thoroughly.  The acting is phenomenal, even if I was a little skeptical at first of the accents portrayed by ""residents"" of my home state.  Oh well, I'll sure I'll be laughing again the next time I graze at a smorgasbord when I'm back there.Can someone tell my how Steve Buscemi has never even been nominated for an Academy Award, let alone never won one?  The guy's been in a zillion movies and never ceases to amaze.Also, William H. Macy should have been in the Best Actor catagory (not Supporting Actor!), and certainly deserved an Oscar as well.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Out of the Darkness,"This is certainly (at the same time) a wonderfully cutting dark comedy and a truly insightful examination of real life in middle class America.  With the exception of a couple of gruesome scenes (certainly integral to the story) and the language (again, probably necessary for realism) this is a must see for everyone.Jerry Lundegard is turning the American dream into the American nightmare. Married to a wealthy woman, his dimwitted greed has dug him into a hole from which his dimwitted ingenuity can never get him out.  His plot spirals him deeper and deeper.The perfect ending to the tale comes with the last of many contrasts between this horrifyingly amoral plot and the wonderfully wholesome Norm and Marge Gunderson.  Perfection punctuated!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Genre-Twisting Noir-Comedy That Still Defines The Coen Brothers,"""Fargo"" is a movie that plays better the second time around. The first time watching it, one might find the film's sheer novelty too much to process. A Nineties indie product to its core, ""Fargo"" mixes noir with comedy, placing atrocious violence in a comforting Midwest setting. None of the characters are beautiful, few are relatable, and even fewer are likable. This originality, however, stays in our minds, pleading for a rewatch. Then, in the subsequent viewings, ""Fargo"" becomes deeply, almost inexplicably endearing.Despite its title, the movie only takes place in Fargo, North Dakota for a single scene. It is the first scene in the film, when down-on-his luck car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) meets Carl Showalter (Steve Buscemi) and Gaear Grimsrud (Peter Stormare) in a bar. Desperate for money, Lundergaard solicits these two men to kidnap his wife (Kristin Rudrüd), hoping that his rich father-in-law (Harve Presnell) will pay the hefty ransom and the men will split it with him.Once the plan is set into motion, though, things go awry. Collateral damage leaves innocent people dead in the small town of Brainerd, Minnesota, creating a trail of evidence towards Showalter, Grimsrud, and Lundergaard. Around the thirty-minute mark, our protagonist - and one of the only decent people in the film thus far - finally arrives. A pregnant cop, Brainerd Police Chief Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) helms the case, leading an investigation between her hometown and the Twin Cities to figure out what happened.The film is impossible to place into a single genre. The bloodshed is like something out of a Tarantino picture, the police-story is a modern take on the detective drama, and yet, laugh-out-loud comedy persists in almost every scene.Nearly everything in ""Fargo"" is subversive. It's about unsexy people enduring an unsexy situation. I won't give away the ending, but the violence only piles higher and higher as the film carries on, and many of our characters slip farther and farther from redemption.As disturbing as that is, it is also hysterical in a (perhaps morbid) way. ""Fargo"" achieves much of its humor through its unique setting. The upper Midwest is considered a peaceful place, and ""Fargo"" does not hide that reputation. A polite culture (and copious Minnesota accents) persists throughout the movie, even as the plot gets bloodier, making for something delightfully uncanny. It is this defiant quirkiness that might be hard to digest at first, but distinguishes the film in the long run.""Fargo"" won two Oscars in 1997 - Frances McDormand won Best Actress and Ethan and Joel Coen won Best Original Screenplay. Both of these accolades were well deserved, but people overlook the movie's cinematography and music. Director of Photography Roger Deakins captures Minnesota's snowy landscapes in a way that is both beautiful and haunting. This is evident in his wide shots of the Great Planes, but it also holds true in his quieter takes of Minneapolis parking lots or icy freeways.Meanwhile, Carl Burwell's score keenly reflects ""Fargo's"" tone. The main theme is tragic, mysterious, slightly dark, but also uplifting, infusing the film with a very fitting, triumphant energy.That triumph comes from the fact that, despite all of ""Fargo's"" violence and zaniness, it does not leave the audience cold. The movie doesn't end with a nihilistic shrug or punch line. A simple message emerges in the final scenes, sending viewers off with unexpected hope.Today, moviegoers more-or-less know what to expect out of a Coen brothers film. The siblings have established a brand for themselves in genre-bending cinema. Before ""Fargo,"" though, the brothers were not household names. While ""The Big Lebowski"" and ""No Country For Old Men"" might rival it for the duo's magnum opus, ""Fargo"" remains the project that put Joel and Ethan on the map, and it remains some of their strongest work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Oh yeeeaaaah, real good!","If it weren't for the ending, this movie would be perfect. The problem is that it didn't say what happened to the characters before the final credits. Perhaps that's excusable because the film wasn't really based on a true story, but you might feel ""left out dry"" if you don't like cliffhanger endings.On the contrary, this film was still very good. All the performances were excellent, and the story keeps you interested all the way through. In other movies there will be parts that are slightly dull, but this is riveting from start to finish. What especially made it good is that you'll find a new thing everytime you watch it, much like The Usual Suspects. This had all the qualifications needed for the Best Picture Oscar and it's unfair that it didn't receive it.While it has less humor than earlier Coen Brother's movies, it still stands out as one of their best films, and maybe the best film of the decade.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A comedy in a dark way.,"The first time that I saw this film is back in November of 98 on TNT. And I thought it was an outstanding film. I consider this to be the Coen Brothers best film about how a kidnapping had gone awry. It was hilarious, twisted, in other words, a must-see. This film had some very funny scenes. But it wasn't a comedy, it was a black comedy. I think that Fargo could have won for Best Picture instead of The English Patient. Sometimes the Academy Awards can be so stupid. My favorite scene in that film is when after Carl and Gaer takes Mrs. Lundegaard to their hideout place, Mrs. Lundegaard attempts to escape and when she trips, Carl says Whoops. I really enjoyed this film and if you haven't seen it, SEE IT! A must-see.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great thriller/comedy with some of the best acting of the 90s,"Fargo is the Coen brothers' second best film (the Big Lebowski is just too funny so I have to put that as #1). Probably the best film of 1996, it tells the story of a simple kidnapping plan that goes wrong in almost every way imaginable. Oscar winner Frances McDormand shines as the pregnant police officer assigned to the murders surrounding the crime, and William H. Macey steals the show as the man who initiates the kidnapping. Coen regulars Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare give good performances as the two kidnappers. Directing by the Coens is also superb. The barren winter landscapes on display build up a good lonely atmosphere and make the fact that all these murders are happening believable. Give this movie a chance, it's one of the best of the 1990s... and it's all based on a true story.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Q. How Many Chips Can A Wood-chipper Chip?,"A. Depends on the SIZE of your Feet! Fargo is a 1996 American dark comedy-crime film produced, directed and written by brothers Joel and Ethan Coen. It stars Frances McDormand as a pregnant(?) police chief who investigates a series of homicides, William H. Macy as a car salesman who hires two criminals to kidnap his wife, Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare as the criminals, and Harve Presnell as the salesman's father-in-law.The film earned seven Academy Award nominations, winning two for Best Original Screenplay for the Coens and Best Actress in a Leading Role for McDormand. It also won the BAFTA Award and the Award for Best Director for Joel Coen at the 1996 Cannes Film Festival.""Fargo opens with a title card proclaiming: ""This is a true story. The events depicted in this film took place in Minnesota in 1987."" Earnest journalists who went in search of the ""real"" woodchipper murders were outraged when, after months of wild goose chases and increasingly deadpan obfuscation by the film-makers, they finally admitted that the title card was actually an elaborate hoax - their way of ""poking a hole in the true story balloon"", according to William H Macy.So Fargo was not, in fact, based on a true story. None of it really happened. There is no real ""Jerry Lundegaard"" out there."" Back to the film: William H. Macy is the best actor in this film, closely followed by my favorite Steve Buscemi. Peter Stormare complements him well in his role as the murderous Gaear Grimsrud. Not to forget the awesome cameos by Steve Reevis as Native American ex-convict Shep Proudfoot.The person I hate in this film is Frances McDormand(Darkman). This b*tch has no acting talent whatsoever and spoils the mood of the film. In this film you will hear her (and some of her buddies) repeating a common phrase OH YAH! OH YAH! YAH! YAH! This gets on your nerves after a while.One thing makes me wonder: how the hell can a PREGNANT local police chief be allowed to work during her pregnancy? This part I DO NOT AGREE ON.The core of the film is based on a botched up kidnapping which affects the lives of many persons. The motive for the kidnapping is money (a.k.a. GREED). Greedy persons in the film are Jerry Lundegaard, an indebted car dealer who hires two men to kidnap his wife. Carl Showalter, a small-time crook hired to kidnap Jerry's wife and his psychotic partner Gaear Grimsrud.Best scenes in the film: Shep beating Carl & Carl getting mince-meated during the films end.This is for me the 2nd best film by the Coen Brothers, the best or 1st ranking Coen Brothers film for me is No Country For Old Men. Miller's Crossing I rank 3rd. Barton Fink I rank 4rth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Superb,"One of my favorite films.  I have seen Fargo many times, and enjoy each viewing more than the last.  The downfall of the flawed Jerry Lundegaard could be the subject of a modern Shakespearean tragedy, albeit one steeped in black humor and outright quirkiness. William H. Macy's character is one of the most intriguing in recent cinema, and he plays the role perfectly. He is fascinating to watch. Frances McDormand, in an Oscar-winning performance, serves as a moral center in a film laden with copious violence and duplicitous, inept characters. Just pay attention to the film's end and you'll see what I mean. I refrain from mentioning too many details, lest I rob the film of its magic, but Fargo is a superbly unique film, a brilliant, dark, and oddly charming piece of work. See it ASAP!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
