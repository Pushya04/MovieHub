"Action rather than horror, but worthy remake","As a HUGE fan of the original Dawn of the Dead I was very skeptical of this remake.  I wasn't expecting an Academy Award winning blockbuster or anything, but I did want to see the remake do the original justice.  I was impressed with the filming more than anything.  This is an action movie rather than horror.  The outdoor scenes are filmed with a grainy, hand-held camera which gave the audience the feeling of being disoriented much the same way the characters would have felt.  The movie was not made in the MTV-generation style that the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was.  Dawn of the Dead stuck to the same mythology of the first without giving it a complete reimagining.  I could imagine the two movies co-existing, but in different parts of the world.One of the key differences that I did like was the idea of the zombies running.  This made them come across as more menacing rather than being the slow clunkers that are seen in the original trilogy.  The idea of being able to walk right past them was abandoned.  I also feel that the movie did a good job of showing how quickly people would turn on one another and watch out for themselves only.One of my favorite ""realisms"" of the movie is how the characters are too attached to their loved ones to shot them when they become zombies.  I'm certain that many of us would react in the same manner if something like this were to actually happen (yes, I know it's impossible).  Also, it was interesting to have so many people make it to the mall instead of only four as in the original.  Of course some of these characters fit the generic stereotype of a movie such as this, but I'm not surprised considering modern audiences would need such characters to maintain their interest.  This was a movie made for film viewers, not film makers.  We have the strong and silent male hero, the quick-thinking blond heroine, the official dumb jerk, the official slut, the young and naive girl who loses everything and needs the group's protection, the angry challenger for group leadership who has a change of heart and becomes heroic, the young trainee who disagrees with the angry challenger yet follows due to a sense of duty, and the stupid follower who gets his comeuppence.One aspect that was missing from this remake was the original movie's social commentary on the commercialism of people.  Ken Foree's character of Peter mentioned this in the original whereas Ving Rhames' Kenneth was more of a silent action hero never having much to say.  This was another reason that I saw this as a simple action movie -- though I will say that Rhames has more acting ability than Governor Schwarzenegger, Sly, Seagal and Van Damme combined.  Rhames also LOOKS like an action hero rather than today's prettyboy ""action heroes"" such as Tom Cruise, Ben Affleck, Nicolas Cage and Keanu Reeves -- who all look like they couldn't fight their way out of a cooking class for senior citizens.All in all this movie was not better than the original and won't be nominated for any Academy Awards, but if you're looking for entertainment and can stomach the blood it's worth checking out.  I can't wait to buy it on DVD someday.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Attention Shoppers! The mall is now closing forever..""","How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?`Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie, a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to `Night of the Living Dead,' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.The movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a tough-as-nails cop, Michael (Jake Weber), who tries to be two-steps ahead of any dangerous situation, and Andre (Mekhi Phifer), whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.Seeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks, the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.The plot is pretty straightforward, and relies mostly on cliché themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.As Ana, Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.Rhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge.First time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves.The horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap.All to often most horror movies are just excuses for numerous poorly developed characters to be killed in awful ways for the enjoyment of the audience. As far as recent zombie movies go, `Dawn of the Dead' thankfully remains closer to `28 Days Later' than `House of the Dead.'However, despite all the movie's strengths, it still pales in comparison to the original. Romero's `Dawn of the Dead' took the premise of people trapped in mall and used it to make some pointed social commentary about consumerism. The first '`Dawn' had human characters selfishly hoarding material goods for themselves, using the mall not only as a refuge from zombies but also as their own personal palace that provides them with more items than they could ever need.It's to the detriment of the new film that it never takes the concept to this level. Here, the story seems to take place in a mall because it's a cool place for a horror movie, not because it can draw out anything interesting in the characters themselves. Also, in the original the zombies wanted inside not only to eat the humans but also because they are drawn to the shopping center since is was an important place to them when they were alive.It's a shame that this time around viewers won't get the chance to see zombies wandering around JC Penney or stumbling up and down escalators, the joke being humans amble about aimlessly themselves like the undead at the mall.`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film but it lacks the superior gory effects from the 1978 movie. That should not stop the squeamish from twitching in their seats due to the horrific content onscreen.Good acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most other horror offerings, but compared to Romero's original it lacks the observations necessary to make it a classic. The first film remains an intelligent critique on human actions during the apocalypse, while this is just a suspense drama that is dressed to kill.8 out of 10 stars. Not as good as Romero's original, but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly great remake,"Dawn of the Dead is a great remake that's funny, tense and emotional whilst also skillfully managing to stand on its own two feet. Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Michael Kelly and Ty Burrell are all great. Zack Snyder's direction is excellent, really kinetic and visceral. The music by Tyler Bates and the soundtrack are both really good. However, it's brought down slightly by the ending (after the credits).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Zombie Flick to Remember!!!,"Dawn of the DeadI'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.Grade: A-",,Anonymous,Horror
An above average film,"With it being Halloween season I thought I'd watch this for the first time and I have to say it's not bad at all. I do love watching films, horror in particular, from years ago, because it really emphasises how far cinema has come. Off the bat you have this really fake blood everywhere and over the top acting to get you scared. However, it's still fun and that's what makes these films great.I won't do a huge review, just gonna quickly whack down the bits that annoyed and move on.1. Characters. A couple were very unlikeable, but overall I'd say 50% of them were just forgettable. Like, I've just seen this film and I cannot remember the names of most. I thought a few of them would make some really annoying and illogical decisions also.2. The first half of the film I thought was quite slow paced. The second half was really fun, but the first was just a little boring.3. Is it scary? No. I think this might be more to do with what people found scary 17 years ago, but there isn't really any jump scares or anything. It's more just a classic case of zombies everywhere.Having said all that, it's a fun film. The final half an hour or so is brilliant and I was completely absorbed by it. I got massive Left 4 Dead vibes watching this and I loved that gaming franchise. But yeah, it's an fun and entertaining film. Don't expect a serious, in depth horror though, because you will be let down. I'd recommend, it's definitely above average, hence the 6/10. But it's not much more than that, just take it as it is and have a bit of fun and see some zombies die.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Why I gave Dawn a 10 (well, maybe it should have been a9).","I've been to thousands of movies in my lifetime and own hundreds of videos and DVDs, so I am a fan but not a bona fide film critic.  This is my first online review.My wife and I saw the original Dawn of the Dead 25 years ago at a midnight show and left wired enough to talk each other down till the morning. Perhaps a quarter of a century has inured us to the violence a bit since we just watched it again (rental video) last week prior to yesterday's venture to the local multiplex to see the remake/""reimagining"" and were mostly unperturbed by the revisit.For some reason, I was hooked on the new Dawn months ago from the teaser and, subsequently, the actual trailer.  The Sparklehorse song in the former fit perfectly and the suburban shot followed by killer Vivian and closing with the burned projector film of the latter was intriguing in its own way. So I was primed to see the movie, usually a recipe for disaster since preview expectations are rarely fulfilled by the finished product.  This time, however, they were.The cast was uniformly believable and, more important, empathizable (at least with the good guys who got sorted out along the way).  Even the playboy jerk had several relevant lines.  Polley was a good, strong female lead (with another great rebuttal -- ""No, I'm a * nurse"" to a query about her medical skills) and Rhames a cheerable, if reluctant, hero.  The camaraderie, such as it was, worked, and visceral me-first survival gave way more often to self-sacrifice.So, what's not to like?  The fundamental premise that a classic got remade? Doesn't wash.  These are two different movies with the same name and similar premises but very different attitudes.  (Better special effects didn't hurt, either, although this new version was oddly less disturbing sans zombies munching on dismembered body parts.)  Speedy zombies (except for the ""twitchers"")?  No problem; hey, they're hungry and, as always, persistent. My attention was held for the better part of two hours; the story was interesting; the outcome ambivalent; the characters arisen to the task at hand, becoming coldly rational to the divisions between life and death and zombiedom; the music weirdly appropriate; the black humor welcome respite. No, Dawn of the Dead isn't Citizen Kane nor is it a sacrilegious assault on the horror genre.  It's solid filmmaking that's entertaining and thought-provoking.  Otherwise, I suspect Romero would never have put his imprimatur on the remake.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"At last, someone's got it right...","If you haven't guessed already, I can't sing the praises of this movie enough - at last, a zombie flick that is two very important things.1) Not a B-Movie; 2) An absolutely cracking A-Movie.Having just got back from the cinema still amazed with the quality of this film I don't know where to begin. The good acting, the spot on cast, the refreshingly unbearable scares, the ""Paul Verhovenesque"" completely unnecessary but compellingly disgusting gore, the almost uniquely un-Hollywood ending... It's all there.What is even more amazing about this movie is that it's [re]creators have also managed to tap into what will surely be the unanimous expectations of the target audience. There are no unwanted and unnecessary messages of family values, cheese, cuddles, and love will conquer all, which is fabulous because it leaves far more room for classic lines like, ""Tell him to shoot Burt Reynolds"" and then the ketchup-tastic head shot that follows. Now you have to admit, that line really can't fit perfectly in to many movies but in the ever consistent mood of Dawn of the Dead, it's right at home.Ving Rhames is easily the second best thing in the movie (second only to the fast moving, constantly hungry and occasionally limbless zombies) once he actually starts speaking, and it is welcoming that Sarah Polley's Ana is as composed as she is subtle which is great for the audience because for a change the lead female character is not screaming every 30 seconds because, oh my god, someone is trying to bite me whilst drooling oodles of blood and saliva all over my nice white t-shirt. again!Her character is only clichéd and therefore flawed once throughout the campaign. As the genius of the group, she is the first to work out that when people are bitten they become very ugly, very quickly and develop a penchant for biting others. However she is still inexplicably opposed to killing the aforementioned soon-to-be cannibals. I don't know about you but whilst she was still talking through the morale dilemma of killing would-be zombies before they turned, I'd already be choosing which sponge I was going to use to clean my shoes after removing my trusty shot gun from a red blob that used to be somebody's face. Maybe that's just me though. us Sagittarians are very impulsive.Since we all have limited attention spans and I'm mindful of not giving too much away about what happens in the move, I'll wrap up by saying that those of you out there who enjoyed this film's original version and have gone on to enjoy films like Starship Troopers, Robocop, Resident Evil etc., then this is definitely the film for you. And even if the above are not representatives of your particular favourite genre, consider this. I went to the cinema with four friends tonight, one of whom stated before paying his money for the ticket, `I don't know why I'm bothering, I hate [rubbish] like this'. He was the one laughing the loudest and coming closest to vomiting throughout the film, and all of us came out saying, `how many Oscars has this been nominated for'..? Sarcastically - yes, but if it was nominated, it'd get my vote. The only thing that could have made it better was Steven Segal instead of Burt Reynolds but you can't have everything.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"In a world of bad remakes, this wasn't bad.","I went into this movie completely excited. And I wasn't even really disappointed either. The acting was very good, and I actually loved how they didn't follow the exact storyline. They took the basics of the original Dawn of the Dead and made it more contemporary. I knew they wouldn't be filming the movie at Monroeville Mall (the mall just 15 minutes outside of Pittsburgh where they filmed the original) but it was still awesome none the less.The script worked rather well, and the movie flowed nicely also. Granted I wasn't a huge fan of the fast moving zombies, but I suppose I can let that go because truthfully, maybe before rigor mortis sets in, you'd be able to move quickly, who knows? But I do know that I was on the edge of my seat through many parts of the movie, and you start to really care about the characters in the movie. I am anxiously waiting for 1 week to pass so that I can get my copy of Dawn. I already have it pre purchased.8/10 rating.The movie missed a perfect 10 for the simple fact that zombies SHOULD NOT run that fast.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Get the unrated director's cut!!!,"I reviewed this film back in March 2004, and said, ""Wow! I just got home from seeing dotd-2004 and can't wait to add it to my collection."" Well, I just added it - the Unrated Director's Cut in widescreen edition. After watching it this weekend, I just had to add a footnote about this version of the film.IT MAKES A GREAT FILM EVEN BETTER.Comments from other reviewers have sometimes made reference to a lack of character development in the film. The UDC version restores this kind of content, and is one way that the UDC version improves on the theatrical release. I see better character development in this version of dotd-2004 then in the (1978) original version of Dawn.The other improvement the UDC version makes is to restore some really excellent gore shots. If you're into that thing, of course. And if you're not - well of course you're into it - that's why you're checking out this film!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
pretty good though not up to the original,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is a remake of the George Romero film from 1978, which was itself a sequel to his 1968 classic, ""Night of the Living Dead."" This new version, written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder, follows the original storyline fairly closely, centering on a group of people who are holed up in a local shopping mall while flesh-eating zombies wreak havoc on the world outside.The original, in addition to being a horror film, was also a playful little satire on the consumerism in modern society. This version shucks this dimension entirely in favor of a straight-ahead horror approach. It may seem impossible for someone to actually ""dumb down"" a horror film, but Gunn and Snyder have managed to do that here. For this reason, the most famous and imaginative images from the first film - that of the undead wandering through the mall, vacantly interacting with the clothing and other paraphernalia contained therein, just as they did in their previous lives - are nowhere to be found in this edition. The other major difference between this and the original is that the zombies themselves are no longer restricted to a lumbering pace but can actually outrun the people they are pursuing. Although, theoretically, this should increase their terror potential, it actually winds up diminishing it somewhat because it robs them of that otherworldly creepiness that made them so scary in the earlier movie.Nevertheless, this remake turns out to be a fairly effective cannibal zombie movie even if it doesn't rise to the level of the original. There's a nice apocalyptic feel to much of the earlier portions of the film, and the screenplay allows for a reasonable bit of character development within the rather limited framework of the genre. There's even a very subtle homage to the great ""Carnival of Souls,"" the far more gentle precursor to all these over-the-top zombie pictures, when a character describes himself as a church organist who sees his ""calling"" as ""just a job."" Although the film isn't really all that scary, ""Dawn of the Dead"" provides just enough tension and chills to make it worth seeing for any true horror film aficionado.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Yawnfest cannot compare to original,"I saw this movie after - and only after - I had been assured that it compared favorably to the original.  I'll never be able to trust those people again.  This is another ""horror"" film that isn't scary, isn't original in any way, and doesn't have any particular redeeming value whatsoever.  It's shot like a typical commercial or music video director would shoot, and the story suffers in the same way - there is no real character development and no dramatic development to sustain a feature length.  What we do have here is essentially the video game version of the original.  Retained are the shoot-em-up scenes of zombie butchery, but gone are the elements of humor and humanity that made the original so original in the first place.  The only attempts at humanizing the film are so utterly misplaced as to be absurd or laughable.  It's a one note movie and that note is one that really ought to leave it's audience feeling disgusted at the end - not because of the gore, but because of the utter waste of time we have been subjected to.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror

"As good as the original, with exciting new directions and room for a sequel!","Shortly after a number of strange cases begin to appear at the hospital where Ana (Sarah Polley) works, a bizarre zombie ""epidemic"" hits the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area full force. Sarah escapes her immediate threats and meets a number of other humans who decide to seek shelter inside a large shopping mall. As they learn that the zombie outbreak is much more widespread than anyone could have imagined, their chances of survival grow increasingly dim.I know an awful lot of genre fans rail against remakes, but like the update of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), this version of Dawn of the Dead is so good that we should instead be clamoring for more.Writer James Gunn and director Zack Snyder knew that they had to come into the remake with both barrels blasting. Hardly five minutes into the film we're already into hardcore, high tension, gore-filled horror material. In lesser films, our introduction to full-fledged zombie activity would have been dream material as a kind of teaser. Gunn and Snyder dispense with such weak-willed tactics and immediately launch into Armageddon. We quickly move to a wide shot of explosions, brutal car crashes and other mayhem.We do finally get a breather while we're learning our cast of characters at the mall in nicely written scenes that bring out personality and depth to the relatively large cast, but horror fanatics need not fret that the film will evolve into a drama--tension and gore are never far removed from the film.Gunn and Snyder earn credit for both paying homage to their source material and taking off into other interesting directions. This remake is just as intense and titillating as Romeo's original, but with a different spin.The cast is excellent, the cinematography and editing exciting and innovative, and the makeup and ""creature"" effects are top notch.Even though I've seen greater quantities, the DVD for Dawn of the Dead also has some of the best extras I've seen on a disc in terms of quality. You get two excellent short films that effectively extend the feature. In one, a new character from the remake, Andy (Bruce Bohne), who runs a gun shop across the street from the mall, gives us a 15-minute video diary of his last 15 days. It's similar in some ways to the feel of The Blair Witch Project (1999), but for my money, it's much better than that film. In the other, we get a 30-minute condensation of the news broadcasts following the outbreak of the zombie ""epidemic"". This also easily beats any mock horror documentary (such as The Last Broadcast (1998)) with its hands tied behind its back. Make sure you at least rent the DVD to check out these extras.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Zombie Flick Ever!,"I have to admit, the Zombie genre isn't my favourite, but Dawn of the Dead (2004) is a brilliant film for so many different reasons. In my view, it's the best zombie movie ever made.The actors are likable, which makes you empathetic to their cause. You want them to succeed, you feel sorrow when things go bad. My main complaint with so many other zombie movies is I couldn't care less about the actors. Also, in Dawn of the Dead, the quality of acting is good, much better than most other films of it's type.The film has plenty of action, but it doesn't detract from being a horror film. There's plenty of gore and quite frankly, the zombies scare the bejesus out of me (and I don't scare easily). I think one think I particularly like about this film is that the zombies are really nasty, fast, aggressive, in-your-face intimidating monsters who would really scare you in real life. I've just never been that keen with slow moving, sinister, but gormless, zombies. The zombies in Dawn of the Dead are truly terrifying.The pace of the film is excellent too. It moves quickly from scene to scene but at a good pace and covers many different things which keeps the film as a whole interesting.I really can't recommend this film enough. I really love it, and that's coming from a guy who's never been really in to zombie movies.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant Zombie horror,"Dawn of the Dead is one of the best Zombie films ever made. It combines a decent storyline, good acting, nice cinematography, good dialogue, good soundtrack and is genuinely scary.From it's brilliant realised and scary opening, Dawn of the Dead holds you by the throat and doesn't let go. The action is pretty much non stop and at times it becomes unbearably tense. As well as a huge amount of gory scenes to keep bloodhounds satisfied it throws in a number of human interest sub plots as the survivors come to terms with their predicament. This stops this being just another one dimensional gore-fest.What elevates it above most of is that it has characters are not only interesting but totally believable. All the cast do a good job in particular Michael Kelly as the power crazy CJ and Sarah Polley, Jake Webber and Ving Rhames as the main survivors.This is an incredibly entertaining film packed full of memorable scenes. Most films are let down by their ending but this one is highly satisfactory if a little bleak. Anyone that likes Zombie movies is almost certain to like it.

"Under appreciated, like most of Snyder's work","I gave Dawn of the Dead a rewatch recently for a few reasons.1) 2020 blows and I can't handle anymore bad news or negativity so I watch a bunch of movies to avoid the news.2) it's been years since I watched it
3) I'll say it proudly, I'm a Snyder fan. I think he's a brilliant director.So I decided to buy this movie because it was cheap on Black Friday. A few things really stood out to me during the rewatch. It starts out with a bang to hook you in, and then gives you some unexpected character development in a unique setting. The cast doesn't really have a ""star"" but it's a solid and diverse crew. It was also really weird to see Phil Dunphy (TY Burrell) from Modern Family playing a cocky jerk, but he played it well. On top of all that, the zombies in this movie are awesome.I also found it cool that James Gunn wrote the screenplay.Also, good news for zombie fans, Snyder has another zombie flick coming out in 2021 on Netflix, called Army Of The Dead. Most people believe this is not a sequel to Dawn of the Dead and probably just a stand alone story. Dave Bautista and Omari Hardwick will star in it.Thanks for reading.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dawn Of The Dead A Decent Horror Remake,"Dawn Of The Dead Is A Decent Horror Remake from director Zack Snyder whose admirable in making this movie about a group of people who hold find themselves trapped in a shopping mall with aggressive flesh eating zombies outside waiting for them to make a mistake. The cast for the most part are good in their roles including Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, and Mehki Phifer. The rest of the supporting cast are okay in their limited screen time. This remake felt more like an action film than horror because it didn't really scare me but that didn't hurt the movie. The action sequences most involving the character being killed in gruesome ways by the zombies or vise-versa are well executed. The zombies did look terrifying and were fast too but you could help but get this feeling you've seen before. The effect worked none the less though. There was a little suspense but the ending was a bit predictable. Despite some flaws Dawn Of The Dead really isn't that bad of a movie because it's sure to please any die hard fan of the genre.

Romero: that was the genius writer/director who single-handedly created the modern zombie film and who also wrote and directed the original 'Dawn of the Dead' in '78), so you may believe me when I say I wasn't impressed when I heard there would be a remake of the zombie maestro's famed horror classic. Truth be told, I was absolutely determined to hate this new film when it came out - but boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise!As it turned out, Zack Snyder's remake isn't just a re-hash of Romero's film but offers a very different take on the material and deserves to be recognized based on its own merits as one of the most entertaining entries in the particular horror sub-genre that is the zombie film. The James Gunn script is hilariously funny throughout - in a pitch black kind of way - and there is simply not a dull moment in it.Furthermore, the cast consists of great character actors who are totally game (Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Michael Kelly and Ty Burrell among others); the gore effects are insane and the zombie makeup is the best pre-'Walking Dead' in any zombie movie by far. I'm inclined to believe that had this film been made by a less divisive director than Snyder, it would have since gone on to be regarded a B-movie horror classic for the ages.It's true that the scathing social commentary which elevated the original ""Dead Trilogy"" above simple gore-fests is largely absent from the remake, but I don't see this as a flaw in the new film. The political subtext in Romero's films was effective in part because it was so subversive at the time; a remake repeating those same beats more than two decades later simply wouldn't have the same impact (which Romero himself actually went on to prove with his far from bad but oddly dated ""New Dead trilogy"" consisting of 'Land of the Dead' (2005), 'Diary of the Dead' (2007) and 'Survival of the Dead' (2009) ).What 'Dawn of the Dead (2004) does brilliantly instead is focus on the characters. Every single player in the remake is fun to watch; even the supporting characters are colorful and more than ""one-note"" and have their own arcs. I would also like to point out that while Gunn's script is lighter on social commentary than Romero's, it's far from dumb, and the story beats are interesting and unpredictable enough to keep you invested throughout.To sum it all up: While I love Romero's film for its clever subtext and critique of consumerism, its impact on the horror genre and its entertainment value, I love Snyder's version for the pitch black humor, the great cast as well as the pure spectacle and non-stop thrill-ride it provides. As far as action-horror films go, it actually doesn't get much better than this: Dawn Of The Dead '04 is simply an A+ genre flick that deserves to get more recognition.About this review: tastes in film obviously vary greatly, so if you want to get a better reference if mine generally aligns somewhat with yours, I created a list of my 50 favorite films on my imdb page which should leave you in no doubt about what kind of stuff I'm into (just click on my name if you're interested).",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Movie,"I can't say I'm a big horror movie fan, but this was a decent, fun movie to watch. The movie was put together well, and begins horrifyingly. The sweeping shots of the unbelievable chaos going on as Sarah Polley escapes her neighborhood are well done.I was really taken with the opening montage, portrayed with a Johnny Cash song, which I'm guessing is called ""When the man comes around"". Very good movie opening; well done, and provides a visual and musical taste of the ugliness to come.The movie provides a little black humor in the middle, as the occupants of the mall indulge in silly fantasies to temporarily escape the terrifying situation they are in (Sex, rooftop golf, dress-up, etc.), all done to a tune that seems to be called ""Get down with the sickness"". There is also a segment of ""Zombie-Celebrity-look-a-like"" shooting gallery that is humorous.Ving Rhames, Jake Weber and Mekhi Phifer are excellent actors who lend name recognition, and strong screen presence to this remake. The other actors all do a fine job rounding out the characters trapped in the mall.Not overly gory, but an enjoyable, and well done, horror movie.Stick around for the end credits, for a montage hinting at the fate of our heroes.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

The first and important film of Zack Snyder,"""Dawn of the Dead"" is, in a precarious way, one of the films that most resemble the classic films of Romero, a simple, voracious movie with traits of humor and terror, with gore, bizarre, suspense and character, a classic apocalypse, with all the well-defined symptoms and ingrained by the beloved and hated Zack Snyder, who already in his first feature already began to demonstrate his traits and exaggerations of unique directions, even if still timid.
Snyder has very well defined his script, he chooses to tell the story of a group of people, so he does not give an explanation about the apocalypse and does not extend much about the destruction of our civilization, this is summarized in an excellent clip of 5 minutes to the sound of a country classic and Snyder already defines in the first minutes the initial nucleus of the group of survivors, that in the future changes, however, the character developments are still in that first group, which gives an idea that the focus of the script was to play with the end-of-the-world issue in people, an interesting and well-made decision.
Snyder uses the script for the film, which is about the zombie instinct, when the world ends, hundreds of them go to the mall, an interesting question, we are alienated alive and dead, but none of this is the focus of the movie. to test many cinematographic techniques - such as the final post-credit - that would eventually make their mark, such as slow cameras, medium framing, gray photography, good use of soundtrack, and redemption of characters.
Zack Snyder knew how to explore the bizarre and the comic in a film, which although little known, is extremely important because it has caused a huge influence and has become a source of inquiries the inspiration for the gaming industry. We have a very close and assertive zombie apocalypse movie that is worth watching, especially for fans of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dawn of the Dead,"Dawn of the Dead was absolutely one of, if not the best, zombie movie ever created. Given the fact this came out in 2004 and is at the level of quality and production is amazing. It looks like it was done just 5-10 years ago. The story was so successful because it was short yet there was so much happening, actual character development and the story ended without being dragged out too much. There was a perfect balance of acting, humor, blood and violence. I really think Zach Snyder absolutely killed this movie and it's one of his best ever. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves zombies or horror.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Clean Up In Aisle 3,"The Dawn arises with a Zombie Apocolypse, so what do we do...I know...let's go to the mall.Dawn of the Dead is one of the great zombie films, filled with a winning combination or scares, gore and laughs.Ving Rhames absolutley steals the show with that glint in his eye.The pacing is right on, never allowing for boredom or distraction to take a hold.This was made before zombies actually took over the earth via every type of viewing screen available.

Etertaining gore-fest!,"This is a remake of the seminal zombie classic and the second zombie film of the year, so how does it match up to the original and indeed Shaun Of The Dead? Well in truth it gets thoroughly beaten hard by the other two but this is still a very enjoyable gore fest. The film is a loving homage to the original taking pretty much the same story and setting of a group of survivors holding up in a mall while thousands of peckish zombies try to break in and eat them. It's got a clichéd group of characters as is usually the case and lacks the heart of the original but this is a very polished and expertly crafted piece of schlock horror.Cast wise there is no star name to headline and ride this like an ego-vehicle and stink up the place, this relies on unknowns and cult actors. In fact the biggest names in this are Vhing Rhames, Mekhi Phifer and Sarah Polley. All the cast are good and Jake Weber in particular is excellent. There is certainly a good mixture in the cast and each character is different. Director Zack Snyder handles things well and creates tension while letting lose when the action hits overdrive.Like Dawn Of The Dead in 78, this film has superlative gore effects. In fact this was a superbly gruesome movie with plenty of zombie biting and flying entrails to keep the gore nuts happy. It is a key element for a film such as this and thankfully the effects are spot on. The film is entertaining and while it's not the best zombie film it has a great beginning that grabs the audience by the nuts and then does so again with the superb ending. ***½",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
29 Days Later?,"Someone pointed out to me that 28 Days Later was not persay a zombie film... and true as that may be, my contention is that Zack Snyder's (who) Dawn redux is no more a zombie film than 28 Days. It is poorly scripted (by Scooby Doo's James Gunn, so what did we expect?) and more closely resembles a sequel to 28 Days Later than a reworking of the classic film it is intended be based on. Sure this one also takes place in a mall, and has cameos from 3 actors from the original, but where the Texas Chainsaw redux created an intriguing, suspenseful and original take on the 1974 film, it also captured the essence of Tobe Hooper's classic. Dawn 2004 captures none of that. This film supposes that none of us have seen NOTLD or DOTD(1978) and tries to pull us in with a dizzying 10 minute prologue, which is taught and well constructed but ultimately leads us to... well NOTHING!!! A bunch of people you don't care about talking, talking and talking some more and for good measure they kill a couple of ""zombies"" so we don't forget what the movie is supposed to be about. Some stupid comic relief for those who can't handle the ""horror"" (if you can call it that) and then the breakneck final act which is edited in that MTV,  shaky cam (Blair Witch), cut every nanosecond pace in which the ""zombie"" attacks in 28 days were edited or for that matter any typical ""Fast and the Furious"" action film of the past decade which is geared to appease the no-attention-span video game playing fans who make this kind of crap so successful at the box office. There were NO scares in this movie, every moment was predictable and formulaic. The attempt at character development via the silly and overlong conversations that took place around the coffee shop only served to bog down the film and I for one nearly left the theater 45 minutes in. Not a memorable performance among the leads. The best moments came from Tom Savini and Ken Foree in brief cameos. Ving Rhames even disappoints and one can only hope that Jack Lemmon hung on to that Oscar that Ving gave him. The film had some (too few to mention) moments, but then so do reruns of ""Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?"" With the recent releases of films like Wrong Turn, Cabin Fever and the TCM redux I was beginning to think there was hope for the horror genre, but after seeing DOTD 2004, I say let the dead STAY dead for now and cross my fingers that George A. can get his 4th dead film made. Any TRUE zombie fan who LIKED this movie needs a lobotomy. When there's no more room in hell... the dead will continue walking right past this waste of time!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
OK remake if you're in the mood for a brainless action picture -- but little else.,"The 2004 Dawn of the Dead is sort of a poor man's version of the 1978 original by George A. Romero, which isn't to say it doesn't deliver the goods in terms of gore, but it has little going on upstairs. It's the equivalent of choosing Paycheck over Total Recall  both films are based on short stories by late sci-fi author Philip K. Dick, but only the latter of the two movies actually amounted to anything memorable and thought-provoking.Then again, I'm in a minority when it comes to the first Dawn  although I liked it enough to purchase the DVD, I didn't love it, and felt a lot of it was silly and not very funny at all. Many critics call it an attack on consumer America (zombies flocking to the mall = us), and while I admire the message and the obvious passion behind Romero's project, I've always admired Night of the Living Dead (1968)  the first installment in the original 'Dead Trilogy'  the best, and think its allegories about racism are even more subtle than the consumer attack in Dead (which is about as blunt as being hit over the head with a hammer).The remake of Dead boasts a better cast but a lot of the dialogue is just as stiff as its predecessor. Also, it often stoops down to the level of sheer stupidity  for instance, when one of the film's characters, stuck in a mall surrounded by zombies, decides to make a mad dash across a street (flooded with the undead) in order to rescue a trappeddog? This makes those 'Don't go in the basement!' moments in other horror films look like brilliant ideas.The zombies in this re-imagining of Romero's tale are faster than the slow-walking numbskulls in the original, which begs the question: If they can run as fast as a car, how come they can't manage to outrun humans carrying heavy weapons, and can't manage to figure out how to break into a mall, when all the humans did was throw a toilet seat through a window? And how come, if they're so strong, the scrawny female heroine can manage to fend one off and shoot it on the head? And yet Ving Rhames can't manage to win a fist-fight with one? Please.IBrains are not required for this film. At all. For that reason it is a solid 'mindless action blockbuster'  but don't expect anything substantial. You could have the IQ of a zombie and still enjoy this.Yes, I was entertained by this movie, and that's why I recommend it as a well-made action flick, but I don't feel the need to see it again anytime soon, whereas the inferiority of this version has just made me appreciate the Romero version even more.",,Anonymous,Horror
One of the best Zombie movies I've seen...,"...and I've seen quite a few. This movie is a must for all those enjoy seeing horror-zombie movies with a twist, but not containing excessive amounts of blood and gore, like BrainDead had. Unlike others, I don't think this movie should compare to Resident Evil because zombies here don't act like those ones, oh no, not at all. You surely will need to see the movie to understand, but I was simply delighted. Most important, this movie contains no pseudo-scientific bullsh!t regarding how do the zombies appear, skips through unnecessary preparation, the soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and the end, oh, the end is... what can I say? Great-great-great! Overall, I very much enjoyed seeing this and I guess it's a movie you can see more than once. I, personally, have seen it 4 times in 2 days and I always found something new to look at.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Less Satire, More Action Than The Original","A nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman, and other survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing aggressive, flesh-eating zombies, take refuge in a mega Milwaukee shopping mall.Production company Strike Entertainment (who had connections to distributor Universal) pulled out all the stops for this film. Being a fan of the original George A. Romero film, as we all are, I initially had my doubts about this one. As it turns out, however, by avoiding much of the original story, writer James Gunn helps the film avoid many of the comparisons it would have been subjected to. This is, for all practical purposes, a film of its own. And between my first viewing in 2004 and more recently in 2017, it has only grown in stature.Gunn's style of work with Troma (""Tromeo and Juliet"") and his later work with ""Slither"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" does not seem to arise much in this film. The humor is more subdued, but I will give him full credit for the Jay Leno / Burt Reynolds target practice scene. Excellent work. To be fair, Gunn actually left the project early to concentrate on ""Scooby-Doo 2"", Michael Tolkin (""The Rapture"") and Scott Frank (""Minority Report"") were brought in for rewriting; Tolkin further developed the characters, while Frank provided some of the bigger and upbeat action sequences. Interestingly, Gunn's ""Slither"" was the next project from producers Strike Entertainment.Zack Snyder makes his feature film directorial debut, though he had made music videos for Morrissey and Soul Asylum throughout the 1990s, so he was not a complete novice by any means. Interesting, Snyder was born in Green Bay, which may explain why the film is set in Milwaukee. Assisting him is cinematographer Matthew Leonetti, who started out on ""The Bat People"" (1974) but went on to great things with ""Poltergeist"", ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", ""Weird Science"" and many others.All of the acting in this is great, especially Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames, so there is no need to even get into that. Polley was Snyder's first choice, actually, which was wise on his part. Nobody stood out as the best, nobody fell short... by horror movies standards everything was kosher. The scenery was also great (it is a mall, it looked like a mall, job done). The zombies? Fantastic! So much better than the original in terms of getting the gore and missing limbs down to a science. Blood today is so much better than it used to be. What you may not know is that the special effects were done by Heather Langenkamp, better known to horror fans as Nancy from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise!There was some dispute between the producers and Snyder about putting Johnny Cash or Richard Cheese on the soundtrack, with Snyder ultimately prevailing. And I say unto thee, you could not have picked two better artists for the soundtrack. The Cash song (""The Man Comes Around"") set the necessary mood while the opening credits create the back story, and the Cheese song (""The Sickness"") kept the mood lighter when it needed to be (horror films really should not take themselves too seriously). Adding the original ""Sickness"" (by Disturbed) was a nice touch. In fact, the soundtrack as a whole really catapulted this film from good to great -- so we have to thank Snyder for that.I really enjoyed the news footage placed in the movie at the beginning and at later times, especially with Tom Savini (""we have a twitcher"") and Ken Foree (the televangelist). It really gave the movie a more ""real-life"" feel and was a good throwback to ""Night of the Living Dead"" with the radio reports, not to mention giving these ""Living Dead"" icons cameos.If you are holding back from watching this because you love the original, give it up. This film deserves a solid chance. If it helps, just ignore the fact the title is ""Dawn of the Dead"" -- this film rips off the original film much less than other films try to do. At least here, proper credit is given, but it really is a breed of its own.The 2017 Scream! Factory Blu-ray is phenomenal and the only home video version worth owning. Take your old DVDs and sell them. Scream! provides a two-disc set f both the theatrical version and the unrated one, both with new 2K scans. The features are packed in -- featurettes, storyboards, audio commentary, deleted scenes. New to this release is behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with several people, including horror royalty Heather Langenkamp and living legend James Gunn.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Intesnesly Great,"The Dawn of the Dead remake would have to be one of my favorite remakes because it is very chaotic, I love the carnage and the film's premises lie on disturbance.At many moments I found the film very, very disturbing. Zack Synder had really put a lot of effort into the remake. his remake also starts off on some happy little slope and then when we see the girl who's a zombie, then we all know that it's gonna get better from there.I like how Zack keeps the film's plot on the exact same story line where there are many survivors trapped in a Mall and that there are Zombies trying to get in. It was great to see that the elements of this great adaptation can be compared to George A. Romero's classic so well.I also like how there were more survivors this time round and it was excellent to see that we could all see what each survivor was going through. Some where determined to get out of this mess, some where stubborn and one was just an idiot. But it was great to have a variety of smart and dumb-witted characters.There were also many sad moments in this film that really left me disturbed and I'm not going to spoil it.Overall it doesn't fall short off of Romero's Classic Dawn of the Dead, having a chaotic situation, fast zombies, different varieties of characteristics & tones of weapons. It is my second favorite Remake and anyone who hasn't seen it yet, see it... 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A worthy remake of the original masterpiece,"A remake of the much loved and revered masterpiece Dawn of the Dead was always going to be sneered at by fans and film scholars alike when the project was announced.I actually saw the film on it's release when I was visiting Glasgow and was expecting to roll my eyes constantly whilst saying 'Psst!' under my breath a few hundred times (but not too loudly...) during the film's running time. I was pleasantly surprised though. Whilst it was no worthy competition for Romero's original film in terms of it's coveted place in horror history, it was far from mediocre. In fact, it was really rather good!The opening scenes show central character Ana finish a long shift as a nurse at her local hospital and return home. The next day a little girl from her neighbourhood comes into her house and shows that all it not well. She has changed into a zombie and fatally attacks her partner, ripping out a chunk of his neck with her teeth. Very quickly, he then springs back to life and also in a zombiefied state like the girl who attacked him.Ana gets to her car and we then see that the very fabric of society has broken down almost completely. People are either dead and running around as zombies and trying to kill others, or they are still human but have either gone completely crazy (witness Ana's neighbour armed with a gun) or are in 'survival of the fittest' mode with no regard for anyone else around them (someone attempts to hijack Ana's car by trying to jump into it).After running off the road, Ana crosses paths with cop Kenneth who, with other characters (one of them pregnant!), goes to the neighbouring mall for refuge.The mall is where the majority of the rest of the movie takes place just like the original. There's even a nod to the first film with a sign for a shop called Gaylen Ross. The theme of a crisis bringing out the best and worst in a person's character is explored well here with the security guards who are already in the shopping centre having marked it as their territory and only letting the new arrivals take refuge if they surrender their weapons and adhere to their rules and laws. This is very Lord of the Flies.The next day even more characters are interjected into the narrative by way of a delivery truck and we now have our cast in place for the rest of the film. And this is one of the major strengths for the remake and that is that the characters are so brilliantly sketched and well rounded. There is a fantastic diversity and range within the characters with some changing by the time of the film's conclusion so that our expectations are constantly being challenged and contradicted with seemingly vile people redeeming themselves and vice versa.The film also perceptively displays human relationships at work. On first arrival most of the characters rub along pretty well. But being in a confined space together soon causes divisions and differences to develop and flare up. The film soon becomes something akin to events in a season of Big Brother but with, obviously, more at stake.As well as great characterisation we also get great make up and effects. The special effects for the film were actually by the company owned by Heather Langenkamp aka Nancy Thompson from the Nightmare on Elm Street films! She should be very proud with the results as they are fabulous.Scott Reiniger, Ken Foree and Tom Savini from the original all get cameos well as the Gaylen Ross reference/homage.The zombies in this film move a lot faster than their blue-skinned counterparts from the original which massively divided fans with Romero himself saying that he didn't like this aspect. I personally think it doesn't really bother me as it's something new just like the film itself. There's also a new rule regarding the dead turning into zombies with there being a set time of a few seconds before the dead arise again. I thought this was also an interesting new aspect of this remake/reimagining.There is also some great humour in the movie also. Witness the 'Celebrity Squares' game that Kenneth plays with his gun shop buddy who is trapped on the roof of his business nearby. This also blossoms into a great moment of camaraderie and dare I say bromance between the two characters. Again, this echoes the same kind of relationship that Scott and Peter had in the original. I thought that it was great that this was reproduced in the remake.I have to say though that on watching this film again for this review after seeing it on it's original release brought diminishing returns this time around. It was almost like when you know what to expect with this remake half of the fun has gone.This remake will never come close to the original film. But on first viewing it was interesting, innovative and had some artistic merit. It's also a great rollercoaster ride that didn't make me roll my eyes once.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fast moving zombies in simple story,"Ana (Sarah Polley) is a nurse in Milwaukee who just finished her shift. She's sleeping with her husband and is woken up by a rabid neighbor girl. She goes on the run for her life. After crashing her car, she's joined by cop Kenneth (Ving Rhames), criminal Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant girlfriend, and TV salesman Michael (Jake Weber). They are cut off and decide to hold up in the mall. They find other survivors and are surrounded by zombies.Director Zack Snyder takes the George A. Romero classic icon with James Gunn script, and he injects it with the fast running zombie like '28 Days Later'. It doesn't try to explain away the zombies. It just gets the action started after a short introduction. It's an exciting action start that showcases Snyder's skills. I especially like the zombies really running hard. The story isn't anything original, but it has the sense of suburban reality. The mall looks real although a few brand name stores would help. I like the character work and I like the simplicity of the story. It knows its simplicity and works within its limits.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Thrilling Remake & The Best Film Zack Snyder Has Ever Made.,"I grew up watching the classic original 1978 zombie epic DAWN OF THE DEAD, so i was so excited when i heard a remake was coming out. That was way back in 2004, twenty years ago!!!So i saw the remake of Dawn of the Dead at the cinema & loved it.This is the only movie i like that director Zack Snyder has made. Let's be honest Zack is a crappy director that relies too much on messy expensive CGI action scenes. Dawn of the Dead was a gritty, raw & ferocious Horror movie with little need for OTT CGI nonsense.I was blown away by how cool this new version of Dawn of the Dead was, it's exciting, darkly funny & upgraded the Zombies to running ones which i much prefer to the silly shuffling ones that are easy to get away from. I loved the fact Dawn took note from how terrifying running Zombies can be after the success of the Masterpiece 28 DAYS LATER.This Dawn is so much fun & has an ensemble cast of wacky characters that are all hiding out in a shopping mall. Sarah Polley as Ana steals the show, although Ving Rhaymes comes 2nd) a nurse who has to escape her way out of her suburban neighbourhood as it descends into chaos with a zombie invasion. The first 10 mins or so are ferociously bloody, intense as hell & exciting. The early 2000's Zombie films are some of the best of the genre with 28 Days Later & Resident Evil & Dawn of the Dead.The action is exciting & suspenseful & edge-of-the-seat at times.It's an exciting & thrilling wild ride as we follow this group of misfits as they try to survive a Zombie Apocalypse.The greatest visual in this movie is when you actually see how many Zombies have surrounded the area when our group try to escape from the mall in battle ready trucks, there's hundreds & it's shockingly scary.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"No, no, no","DAWN OF THE DEAD; a remake of George A. Romero's 1978 same titled apocalyptic, epic, zombie horror action thriller drama masterpiece; this 2004 version sometimes seems good, especially in the first 20 or 30 minutes leading up to/getting to the shopping mall (putting aside the cliche of the pretty female nurse working in a major hospital). When the protagonists get inside the mall there's this promising bit where music from the 1978 George A. Romero film composed by the Italian band Goblin, kicks in. But that's the only time in this remake uses that music/it's over in a few seconds and things go downhill from there. The protagonists are now in the shopping mall. They stumble across security guards hiding in the mall, which was meant to add complexity/depth to the situation. But it doesn't; it's just security guards hiding in a mall/protecting their turf (wow). Nancy Allen said in an interview on the Robocop remake (2014); words to the effect of: 'You only remake films that had a good idea but were executed badly'. Exactly. I reckon it'd be cool to remake films for younger audiences who weren't around when the original came out: SPFX have improved; now it's possible to make remake movies so that they're better looking/more polished. But they should leave it to the original director/creative team (if they're still around which George A. Romero certainly was): 'Hey George, this is so and so calling from Universal Studios and we want you to remake Dawn of the Dead; you can have as much money as you like; we'll give you whatever you need/you'll have full creative control'. If the director of the original film agrees (or at least has a role in overseeing the production) then remake it. Otherwise leave it alone. Part of the reason why the original Dawn of the Dead (1978) was better was because George A. Romero worked largely outside of the studio system; he was independent, didn't use big stars and yet his movies kicked arse; the original had a insight into human nature, materialism; captured a sense of dread and uneasiness as we watch a breakdown of society. This remake isn't as good, isn't as insightful and it seems trite in comparison. The remake is uneven in tone, never really gets going/the gore doesn't take off/there's crappy slow motion, like when zombies are being blasted off the caged wire fences in the underground parking lot. After the first act, this remake's boring/there were missed opportunities; the 1978 Dawn of the Dead let rip; this remake doesn't. 5/10 for trying. And hey; it's easy to criticize: try making a film.",,Anonymous,Horror

There are some really horrifying events, plenty of scares, a good cast of characters played by capable actors, lots of action, a few moments of levity, and tons of zombie mayhem. It avoids the overwhelming deluge of heavy-handed social commentary that so many zombie movies drown in (Land of the Dead, anyone?), but it's also not just a completely shallow experience.You can't really go wrong with Dawn of the Dead if you're even slightly a fan of the genre. It starts with a bang from the very beginning, and rarely lets up the intensity. See it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best Zombie Movie Ever,"Maybe that isn't saying much since the genre has a ton of trash in it. But this movie has Everything, creepy scares, startle scares, gore, action, comedy, great casting, likable characters, unlikeable but hilarious characters, and the MOST important REWATCHABILITY (did I just make up a word? No, I have been using it for years). This movie is fantastic to watch over and over, start anywhere or just enjoy for a few minutes here and there. It's great to watch and imagine how differently things could have gone for the group.A zombie masterpiece and Snyder's best film if you ask me! I would have loved to see a sequel!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent remake but still a mile from the original.,Right first off if you hate fast zombies avoid.Now you've got over this then it's a pretty enjoyable film.To be honest the only real connection between this and Romero's epic is the shopping mall.Characters are pretty average and you don't really care who lives or dies.Sarah Polley is very good but the rest seem pretty forgettable.Without giving spoilers away I did sorta enjoy the ending.One of the better zombie movies made in the last 20 years.,7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zombie Remake,"Zack Snyder's remake was quite a fun watch. Horror fans will enjoy this one. It's been ages since I last saw the original remake and my memory is a little clouded but this one has some good special effects, decent acting, a nice soundtrack and effective cinematography. Due to high production values, it looks good. I remember that it is not as gruesome as the original wear you can actually see the zombies ripping off body parts of live people and devouring them. The 'good' main characters are quite likable as they are more humane than the stereotypical caricatures one has witnessed numerous times in such films. I was surprised to see Sarah Paulie who has a reputation of being selective with her films. This was quite an unusual choice for her and she did quite well as the heroine. Jake Weber and Ving Rhames are fine too. Overall, it is a good effort by Snyder and an entertaining flick for horror fans.",,Anonymous,Horror
Dawn of the Dead,"Flesh eating zombies attack a group of civilians at a large shopping mall in 'Dawn of the Dead', a 2004 remake of George Romero's classic.The film begins with our main character Ana coming home after finishing a shift as a nurse, missing the emergency news bulletin detailing the latest on zombie attacks. Her and her husband Luis wake up to a whole new world as a little zombie girl sneaks into their house, killing Luis. Completely traumatized and scared, Ana runs out of her house and eventually finds a group of people looking for refuge from the evil that has taken over the world. They come across a seemingly abandoned mall and decide to break in to stay alive.Over time, some of the group end up succombing to the attacks of the zombies. Some of the single people start building romantic relationships with the others as well, including our main character Ana. When the mall no longer becomes a safe haven for the group, they decide to leave and go on the run in the city. When it becomes clear that the only way to stay alive is to take a boat to an island, it's a race against time (and zombies) to find a way off the main land and get to safety.My major critique (like most people including George Romero had) was that I hated that the zombies can run in this one. Nope. I have never been a fan of running zombies. It makes the creatures less creepy and eerie for me, which is what I want when I'm watching a film like this. Other than that, it was an enjoyable film overall. The acting was good, led by Sarah Polley and Mekhi Phifer. And the characters were well fleshed out and for the most part we wanted them to survive and do well.This 'Dawn of the Dead' remake was a lot of fun, and overall a solid zombie entry. The only issue I had with it, like with most remakes, is that it just wasn't as good as the original. It derfinitely felt more like an action film than a zombie horror movie.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Superb horror film,I saw this movie in the theater when it came out and I was really surprised. I was expecting a standard horror remake but this movie makes you sit up and take notice. Its almost impossible not to be pulled into the story.This was Zach Snyder's first movie and he really brings the firepower. This is a very scary zombie experience on steroids and a game changer in many ways. Horror films couldn't get away with slacking like they used to. Dawn of the Dead changed that.Definitely check this out if you haven't seen it.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Was it better than the original?,"Whenever a film gets the modern treatment, the use of the technical can destroy the spirit of the acting - I think that happens with this remake.I found the film thrilling and scary but not as scary as I thought it should be.The performances are fine but I just didn't care if they lived or died, with the exception of the dog of course! I found the ending rather predictable too and would have preferred less definition - let the viewer decide.I now await the next instalment of the zombie film genre and hope that they put more effort into making the characters come to life (pardon the pun).7 out of 10 but had the potential to score 8 or 9.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

decent remake,"When I think of ""Dawn of the dead"" I think of the original featuring Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger. However this version is more of a film that has a doomsday feeling to it because the initial tone of the film is a lot more fast paced and the zombies seem to have speeder up and are a lot more dangerous and psychotic than their lumbering counterparts in the original.Sarah Polley is great as the main character while Ving Rhames is great as the disgruntled police officer and Jake Weber,Mekhi Phifer, and Lindy Booth are great counterparts who add their own credentials to the production in their Zombie infested hellhole where they are situated. This version of the film has been trimmed considerably from the original in which that focused on the isolation and how would you fill the time if you had an abandoned mall while on the flip side this one focuses more on the action and not the mental side of it all just like the first one did. However, a new addition to the film were the Zombies who instead of lumbering aimlessly around they attack with a ferocity like no other. However, one thing I like about this film is the use of different ideas within the film. and toys with different scenarios on how to escape and does not resort to a scene by scene remake of a film done oh so poorly by Gus van Sant in the 1998 version of ""Psycho"" that film made me laugh. However, when watching I do feel that the narrative is a little weak and is not as well made as the original and the other characterised are just there to be Zombie chow therefore, allowing the main characters escape.In conclusion it is a well made film that is worth buying on D.V.D but if you want a memorable zombie film I recommend the original",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of the rare...,Remakes that are just as good as the originals. You could tell the filmmakers had a love and passion for the original film. But instead of doing a direct shot by shot remake they took those elements and took a more modern spin on them and it worked fantastic. I haven't had this much fun watching a zombie movie and a very long time. Shows like The Walking Dead owe a lot to this remake because up until then although zombies were scary they were never really taken too seriously. For me this is one of the first zombie movies that made the zombies extremely terrifying. Great film!,9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"It works!!!  My god, it works!!!","I, too, was surprised about enjoying this movie. I expected a gore fest with nothing else, but was in for a pleasant surprise. The big thing was trying to figure out who lives and dies, which always makes for fun. Also, the humor but crisp and fun. After a barrage of killing zombies, our ""humans"" are stuck in an elevator playing, you guessed it, ""elevator music."" The character of CJ breaks us up by saying ""I like this song."" Funny stuff. Sarah Polley was OK, at best. Ving Rhames was great, as was CJ, whoever he is. The ending credits sort of ruined some of it, but not completely. I think it would have been best left out. For a person who does not like horror movies, I recommend this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good remake,"Dawn of the Dead--an old favorite of mine--has been remade with a certain degree of flair. The characterization is strong, and most if not all of the social commentary of the original has survived intact. In certain ways, it is an even deeper film than the original (especially with the relationship between a solitary survivor and the main group). As would be expected from a Juliard graduate, Ving Rhames is the stand out, but the supporting cast is equally as strong.The effects are simple and yet effective, the zombies behave very much like other zombies (there is more of a debt to 28 Days Later than to Night of the Living Dead in terms of zombie agility), and the film is quickly plotted out.I'd see the film if I were you. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good remake,"I gave this movie a try after watching the original Dawn of the Dead which came in 80s. I didn't like the original as it was too slow and boring.

The story was above average, the screenplay was good, the performances were average and the direction was good. The runtime and the pacing was also good, you don't feel bored. The action scenes and the thrill was good in the movie.Overall, it was a good action zombie movie which you can give a try as it has good entertainment value.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Snyder hits it out of the park.,I'm in awe of this film. The first 15 mins have to be up there with the greatest opening scenes in movie history. From Ana entering the full blown apocalypse in her street to the news clips to Johnny Cash singing The Man Comes Around. Absolute gold and I've lost count of the times I've watched it. The rest of the film takes us to the scenario of our survivors stranded in a mall trying to make sense of it all. The casting is excellent with the zombie hunting legend that is Ving Raymes doing what he does best. There are some other really great likeable characters that we meet along the way that all help to make this great film. I can't recommend it enough.

Hands down the greatest remake of all time!,"Epic from the jump, including the opening credits.

In addition, although I'm sure many will not take advantage, perhaps some of the best and most entertaining bonus features on any disc ever made.The original from 1978 will always hold a special place in my heart, as will George Romero, but this remake, it's up there with the absolute best of them.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Different Type of Movie Than the Original,Anyone hoping for a film as deep and filling as George Romero's original zombie classic will go to bed hungry after witnessing Zach Snyder's remake which replaces commentary for non-stop action.He's assembled a strong cast and crew to bring his vision to life and it works if you're in it for the action and gore over anything more meaningful.

Loved it,"First of all , don't watch this if you are looking for the next Citizen Kane. However , if you like a movie in which you can switch off your brain and sit back and enjoy a nonsensical movie then this one is for you. I like the original , and to be honest was expecting a poor interpretation , but I thought this was pretty good. Remake is probably not really the right word because other than the shopping mall and zombies, it doesn't really have the slow build up of tension that the original has. Instead it is a zombie movie for the teenagers of today - faster, more guts and blood, more pointless characters to kill off and more action. And overall it does work pretty well. There is only one poor part of the film , in which there is a bit of a lull in the action , and the attempt to spruce it up by introducing a teenage girl and a dog , doesn't really work.However the end sequence involving chainsaws and explosions more than makes up for this. If your looking for cheap thrills in a movie then this one will do the trick. There is also a pretty good soundtrack to accompany the action.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Can somebody explain why this movie gets more than 5?,"I just finished watching dawn of the dead and i am terribly sorry for the time i wasted. My first thought was, why don't i log on to IMDb.com and see the rating?? And i see a rating of 7+!!! What the hell?? This movie is a complete waste of time to watch. Everything is set up, and you can tell that every scene. I mean, one moment all the dead are overflowing in the streets, and the next moment there are only 5. Or on one moment they can smell the living from very far, and the second moment they can't track a living human 5 meters away, until they hear a noise coming from there. And these are just some examples. The movie is full of Hollywood clichés.Go see fight club. Don't waste your time.",,Anonymous,Horror
Apocalyptic,"More than any 'zombie' movie I've ever seen, this remake of Dawn Of The Dead feels most as if the world was actually ending. There's no surprise that Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" plays during the credits as we see news footage of the chaos occurring all over the world. Most of the movie takes place in a mall, so basically we're left in the dark as to what's going on everywhere else. The TV broadcasts have shut down, rescue helicopters have stopped coming, there's some guy on the roof of a building across the street. You start to wonder if these characters are the last surviving people on earth. Unlike the original Dawn Of The Dead, we aren't shown any other groups of people.And of course I have to bring this up: the running zombies. I actually thought it's scarier when they're running and screaming. Especially when they're in huge numbers like in one of the last sequences where the characters are trying to escape. But that's just my opinion. I guess overall more people prefer the slower, more reserved zombies.So to add it all up, there isn't anything really new or unique about this movie except maybe that the aspect of the apocalypse is accentuated more than it usually is in these kinds of movies. You have the long quiet scenes followed by a loud scare, the gruesome deaths, the comic relief thrown in here and there (really great comic relief by the way), all the ingredients to make a zombie movie. I probably would have liked it better if the ending wasn't so stupid but for the most part its really enjoyable and mildly scary. If you like zombie movies I don't see any reason why you wouldn't like this. It's a powerful horror/action flick.My rating: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad,"I went into this not knowing if I was going to like it. If you can get past the idea of Undead Olympic Sprinting Super Humans instead of our shambling old friends in the original, it's actually pretty enjoyable. I liked how the film worked dialogue and images from the original into the remake and even into some of the key scenes. The Tom Savini scene was also golden.On the down side, I didn't buy some of the character actions here and there and the dog plan was down right stupid. The rule that made it work wasn't established until a character said so. It reeked of a convenient plot device. I also liked the ending before the credits rolled and would have preferred that instead of the bit during the credits, just because they would have captured the same feel of the original's ending. It also seems that the zombies would have smashed the glass front of the mall in order to get in faster than it could be boarded up. The remake was also missing a pie fight. >:( Over all, this was an enjoyable horror/action flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Best! CLASSIC,This is absolutely one of the best zombie flicks that's ever been made. Truly terrifying how fast the zombies are in this movie.

Cinematic Cotton Candy,"When I first heard ""they"" were redoing ""Dawn of the Dead,"" my heart sank. How could anyone recreate the magic and thrill of the 1978 classic? Well, they didn't ... but the movie was entertaining enough that I have now watched it thrice.The opener really sucks you in. It's creepy, visceral, and glues you to your seat. It's so good, in fact, that those first 5 minutes provide enough juice to carry you through the rest of the movie, no matter how bad the rest might be. Fortunately, the next hour and a half is pretty interesting, too.The directing and photography really help the film; it creates a cold, wet, slippery atmosphere well-suited to the zombie sub-genre. Normally the shaky, documentary-style camera work would be inappropriate for a zombie flick (I find it irritating in almost any movie), but this one is different from other zombie movies in ways that make the technique tolerable.As scary and fun as ""Dawn of the Dead"" is, it lacks something. Maybe there was too much heavy metal in the soundtrack, or maybe the characters did one too many unbelievable things. But I've never just sat back and said ""whoa,"" or had much to say to my friends about the movie. Like cotton candy, it's tasty and you'll probably want it again, but it leaves a funny, unpleasant aftertaste.The new ""Dawn of the Dead"" stands head and shoulders above most Horror films that come out these days. But it hardly clears the original's waistline.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
How to make a remake,"I saw this remake of the 1978 Romero zombie classic at the cinema in 2004, I didn't realise back then that it was the cut theatrical R version. I have just now thoroughly enjoyed revisiting it, this time uncut on DVD. Early on in we see nurse Ana Clark (Sarah Polley) finishing work and driving to her suburban home to the tune of ""Have a Nice Day"" by The Stereophonics. Unknown to her her young daughter is a zombie, who then rips her husband's throat out, he then becomes one too. Ana escapes by the skin of her teeth, she is indeed not having a nice day! She soon meets cop Ken Rhodes (Ving Rhames), the pair, along with a few other survivors, make their way to a shopping mall. Whilst the mall is central to both the original and the remake the 2004 version is more of a reimagining, not a scene for scene remake. Which is no bad thing. Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames make two great lead characters, he has had some bad parts in some bad movies but shines here. A nice touch has Tom Savini and Ken Foree from the original appear in small roles. There is a ton of gore and violence, a bit of nudity and also some great humour. Despite being a very good film there are a few things that I didn't go much on. Firstly I am not keen on zombies that can sprint like Usain Bolt, I prefer the shuffling type. Secondly much of the special effects use CGI, not a fan of them myself. And thirdly at times the movie looks like a MTV music video. However, for a directional debut Zack Snyder did a great job, Dawn (2004) was made during a time when horror remakes and zombie films were being churned out left, right and centre. This is easily one of the best examples on both counts. Not as good as the 1978 original but as remakes go this one is highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Above Average Remake,"After a thrilling opening sequence where a young nurse (Sarah Polley) wakes up to find her entire neighborhood overrun with zombies, she meets a rag tag group of survivors who decide to hide out at an abandoned mall where they meet even more survivors and they all have to band together to survive this ordeal.The scope of this Dawn of the Dead is slightly larger than Romero's original (there were only a tiny handful of characters in Romero's film) and there are some great action sequences, but there are times when it feels a lot more hollow than the original film and some of the humor doesn't always work. While most of the CGI is decent, there's one effect involving a zombie baby that should have been left out altogether.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
An Intense Zombie Film,"This film decides to take a more direct horror approach than the original which was more of a social commentary and creates an intense thrill-ride. Zombies are fast and animalistic while the filter over everything is high contrast, creating a raw atmosphere. Snyder creates a few memorable shots, such as the intro when everything is just beginning to fall apart and the title sequence filled with the news clips, and delivers a mostly efficient and entertaining zombie feature that makes itself into its own apart from the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ferocious Beginning; Downhill From There!,"Why remake a good movie? (Oh! the money...duh!) Personally, I'd like to see more movies that WEREN'T done right the first time get remade.My expectations were a little low. Then the movie starts!...and Hey! there's hope after all. A creepy beginning that gets sca-aarr-rry! OK! I can live with 'super-zombies' if this quality is maintained. Unfortunately, the opening is the best part.For any film to succeed ya gotta have something called characterization. And except for Sarah Polley and (the always reliable) Ving Rames; everyone else is snoresville. There's just too many characters filling up space and not enough quality writing to justify their being there. Where's the acting? The shock or panic? They seem to be just running thru their lines as if they can't wait for ""lunch is here"" to be announced.Even in horror movies, a certain logic has to prevail to make the surrounding apocalypse feel believable. This has holes large enough for a fleet of semis. It feels like everyone was so impressed with themselves that they were somehow part of horror history with their involvement with a 'Romero Dead Remake' that the logical details were forsaken for shock sake. And this list of plot holes are too long to take up time to start listing.Conclusion: Stick with the original and rent for curiosity sake. Not without merit, but it just didn't work for me...I'd rather watch a scary movie the scares!",,Anonymous,Horror

I was however interested to see how they'd adapt the films into modern cinema.It was a very interesting movie. A movie I enjoyed highly.Director Zack Snyder does a a fantastic job on his film debut and James Gunn's work on the original script deserves praise.WELL DONE for making the Zombies run... Adds more fear!From the outstanding credit opening with Johnny Cash's ""Man Comes Around"" to the end credit sequence this was fun to watch.Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Ty Burrell & Michael Kelly all do a fine job in this film which is full of the gore the fan boys want and the comedic touches I wanted!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zack Snyder's debut film remakes the classic Dawn of the Dead with his own unique approach and style from James Gunn's solid script,"In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) flees for her life when a zombie outbreak leads to a breakdown of society with the creatures killing and eating the uninfected while survivors resort to violent means to secure resources and their lives. Ana eventually meets up with police officer Kenneth (Ving Rhames) and shortly thereafter are joined by Andre (Mekhi Phifer), Andre's pregnant wife Luda (Inna Korobkina), and TV salesman Michael (Jake Webber) with the group deciding to take refuge in the local Crossroads Mall and ride out the events. However once in the mall, the group must contend not just with the undead, but also with other volatile survivors and figure out a way to survive the plague of undead.During the early 2000s, the zombie sub-genre of horror which had largely been dormant with the end of the 80s got a resurgence of life thanks in no small part to the UK produced 28 Days Later or the German produced adaptation of the game Resident Evil. While James Gunn's writing of the script was initially met with online resistance thanks to Gunn's association with the critically panned but not all that bad Scooby-Doo film, but managed to silence criticism with positive reception to his script. Zack Snyder who'd previously worked in TV commercials chose to direct the film chose the film as his debut feature as he appreciated the fact he was making a remake gave him motivation to ""care about every shot"" so he wouldn't just be copying the direction of the Romero version. Upon release the film received excellent reviews from critics (especially for a horror film) and was also successful worldwide with the film making $100 million against its $26 million budget. Dawn of the Dead is the rare example of a horror remake done right especially when viewed in context with its contemporaries such as the Platinum Dunes produced remakes of Amityville Horror and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.While the original '78 Dawn of the Dead focused primarily on a group of four characters going around the mall mostly killing time until the (spoilers for this over 40 year old film) biker gang climax, the 2004 remake plays itself with a lot more urgency and intensity including making the zombies ""runners"" much as they were in 28 Days Later. Snyder's direction does a good job of capturing the large scale of chaos during the undead apocalypse with the opening sequence where Ana's flees for her life through the Milwaukee suburbs giving a good look at the breakdown of society with the undead and trigger happy survivors posing varying degrees of threat.Sarah Polley is really good as our initial proxy before the film becomes more of an ensemble piece, and is much more active in the plot in comparison to the '78 versions Fran character who was a mostly passive element until around the second half (not a criticism against the original, just an observation). Ving Rhames also does well as Kenneth who does have some comparisons with Ken Foree's Peter from the original film in that their both cops and strong black charismatic leads, but Gunn's script and Rhames' performance find their own character that manages to stand apart from Foree's performance in the original and gives Rhames some solid character moments including an element involving his friendship he strikes with a gun store owner named Andy played by Bruce Bohne. The movie also has a solid ensemble cast with Jake Weber, Matt Frewer, Ty Burrell, Kevin Zegers and Michael Kelly and much like genre classics such as Predator, the characterization is simple but substantial in equal parts because of the writing and performances.Snyder's direction of Gunn's script is nicely done which has a more polished look in comparison to the rougher edge of the '78 version, but unlike instances of that polish serving to the detriment of a remake such as the case with the Platinum Dunes takes on Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Amityville Horror, the polish of Snyder's direction feels like it's in service of the tone and approach laid out in Gunn's script so the polish is more complementary and leads to a more cohesive experience as a result. This is especially true of the action sequences including a climax involving modified parking shuttles which might've inspired elements in Romero's own Land of the Dead particularly with the Dead Reckoning vehicle.Dawn of the Dead is an excellent companion piece to the original film and manages to find its own identity distinct from the original in style tone and execution. While the style and approach have a greater level of polish than the '78 original, the ideas and violence are still as gnarly and messy as you remember them in the best possible way.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not that bad, actually","First of all, I would like to say that I saw this before I saw the Romero version. Now with that out of the way, I think that despite the fact that nearly all satire is gone from this film, it was still very good, the first fifteen minutes of the film were awesome, by itself it could have been a very, very good short film, but then the credits ended and the film got slightly worser and worser as it went along. The acting was not that bad, even though a lot of the dialog was immensely cheesy, mostly due to Ving Rhames, nearly no character development, except for the main security guard. The zombies were very impressive, but on the topic of zombies, they were fast, I'm not a fan of fast zombies, but maybe because I really love old-school zombie movies. But the main thing here that I did not like was that there are about Seven or Eight people in the mall this time, unlike in the original where there is four, giving very little times to really know most of the characters. But in the end it is still a better-than-average zombie movies. Not anywhere near as good as the original but still good.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Nice Film, But Falls Still At Some Points","I went into this film skeptical, judging from the content and quality of past ""zombie movies"", but this film surpassed my expectations at most times, but at times, it fell short of those same expectations.The film has a nice soundtrack and overall, the sounds period. The music leaves you wondering what's going to be at the next corner, but most of the time it is nothing, leaving you wondering when something WILL happen, and you never know when so it just jumps out at you.I had an epiphany tonight. I thought that all remakes of ""B-flicks"" had to have cheesy blood and skin effects. I was wrong here. The blood and gore is done near perfectly, the blood and wounds realistic and you feel how bad it would be if those events were taking place on you.There is no long ""set-up"" for it, but we jump right into an interesting story that doesn't have many stale points. At times, the story does get kind of lame like a ""B-flick"", which is slow and overdone, but that doesn't prevent this movie from giving you the zombie goodness that you want.One argument that I have with this film is that we never become enlightened on the origin of the zombies. It would of been nice if we could of at least known the reason the zombies were appearing. Maybe if they would of remade ""Night Of the Living Dead"" first that disappointment would not be in existence.Overall, a nice movie, but has its bad parts, like any film. The acting isn't stale and stiff, and the actors fit into the characters perfectly. I'd recommend this movie for any zombie-movie-junkie, but if you're easily queased, don't see this unless you expect to cover your eyes a lot of the time.John Hughes (with the assistance of Cory Darenzo)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Entertaining as Hell,"Having recently seen the original (I bought it so I could get the Hellboy Sneak Preview DVD, plus I own Night of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead, I went into seeing the reimagining (the new Hollywood buzzword for remake) with an idea of why the first has such a huge reputation among horror fans.The original is slowly paced with a small cast.  The makeup is generally crappy, but some of the splatter effects are pretty good.  The blood looks like reddish paint.  The characters are pretty well drawn out and well-rounded.  The shopper mentality allegory still holds up well.  All in all, a pretty good movie, and I can see how it would have been somewhat revolutionary for it's time.  Romero knows his zombies.Fast forward almost 20 years and enter James Gunn, the writer of Scooby Doo the Movie and The Specials.The Specials, if you haven't seen it, is an extremely funny superhero parody film, and in my opinion, better than the bigger budgeted Mystery Men, which came out at the same time.  However you couldn't pay me enough to watch Scooby Doo.  I won't even watch the cartoons.Dawn of the Dead is definitely a post-28 Days Later zombie film.  The camerawork is flashy, yet at times, grainy, the zombies move at a lightning pace, chasing and often outrunning their victims.  Even aside from being a remake, the ideas are culled from every other influential zombie flick of the past twenty years, with subtle nods to the Evil Dead series, Dead Alive, 28 Days Later, etc.Despite the inherent flaws, the movie accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.  It's a scary movie.  Everyone in the audience jumped exactly when we were supposed to.  We were grossed out when we needed to be, and we laughed when it was deliberately funny.  Overall, it's just a highly entertaining movie.The basic plot follows Ana (Sarah Polley from Go) as she wakes up one morning to find her neighbor's daughter in her hallway.  Ana's husband goes to the girl, only to get his throat ripped out, kicking off the action forthe rest of the film.  Ana flees, horrified, refusing to be approached by anyone, living or dead.  Shortly thereafter, she runs into Kenneth (Ving Rhames of Pulp Fiction), a cop heading toward an alleged safe area. Almost as soon as they set off together, they meet three survivors who have decided to seek refuge in the local mall.  Of course, at the mall, they meet a handful of other survivors, and begin to formulate a plan of escape.There are quite a few scenes of solid character building, making the major characters into real individuals, however the supporting cast are generally just caricatures.  But overall, there are just simply a lot of ""cool"" bits that, sure, they may be just filler, but it's interesting and exciting filler.Some of the cast of the original ""Dawn"" make cameos.  Ken Foree (Peter from the original) plays a televangelist, and gets to say the tagline in both films (When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth). Tom Savini (Special FX guru, and a biker from the original film) plays a sheriff who figures out a way to kill the zombies.Matt Frewer also has about 2 minutes worth of screen time in the film.  It made me sad, mostly to think that this is now his career.  Poor Matt Frewer.There is another character in the film named Steve, and the entire time he was onscreen, I could only think one thing: ""That should have been Bruce Campbell.""  The actor playing Steve looks like a younger Bruce Campbell, the character has that sort of smarmy, cocky charm of a Bruce Campbell character, he just should have been Bruce Campbell.The soundtrack surprised and impressed me.  Being a big budget studio popcorn/action film, I expected a soundtrack full of the latest altnewxradio friendly fm rock bands.  Instead, the music is mostly very offsetting to the film, giving it a little more of a creepy edge.  The opening credits are run to the tune of Johnny Cash's ""When the Man Comes Around"".  On the other hand, the end credits have Disturbed's ""Sickness"" playing, but to offset that, during the movie, the same song is played, but performed by Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine.  I may seek out the soundtrack.All in all, I loved this movie, it creeped me out.  I love/hate zombies, and this did well by the zombie genre.Stick around for the end credits.  All of them.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
fun at the mall !!!,"I thought this movie was good, fun in many situations, not very scary if you have seen horror before but good entertainment for a Saturday night. The only thing that bothered me was the color of the blood that flooded in the movie: not natural. The bad guy did a good job playing the pain in the ass. And what's a good thing in my eyes too: the color of the people didn't matter in this plot to their chances on survival.the fact that it wasn't so scary for me can be explained a bit because of the fact that similar scenes e.g. fights with the enraged undead appear in for example '28 days later'. Compared to 28D's the storyline of this movie is a little lighter. More concentrated on suspense.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Action-filled remake isn't half bad.,"Remake of Romero's classic Dawn of the Dead (1978) is pretty good, even though it mostly steers away from the original film.Zombies are running amok, which leaves a number of people trapped inside a shopping mall, but how long will they be able to live there?Dawn of the Dead 2004 basically only keeps the premise of the original film, building a new plot with a larger number of new characters, and with the help of director Zack Snyder it becomes an entertaining flick. The film is packed with action, some new suspenseful situations, and some nicely done humor. This remake is all the more intense because it doesn't use the typical 'zombie' image, but rather re-invents the flesh-eaters as more cunning creatures, after all they do run in this film! There's also plenty of freakishly good make up FX to be had and a great rock soundtrack.The cast is pretty good, Polley, Rhames, Weber, Kelly, Booth, and Zegers being especially good characters.Dawn of the Dead 2004 remains the most critically acclaimed horror remake thus far, and it's not hard to see why.*** out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A refreshingly good horror movie,"I like the new direction of horror films. After the ensemble-cast ""whodunnit"" trend started by Scream, then the return to haunted houses, then the return of the ""unstoppable killer"" (Freddy, Jason, etc). Now, with this film and Texas Chainsaw Massacre, there's a good blend of classic horror stories done with a current film-making-style attitude. There are two things I really liked about this movie: 1) They don't try to explain anything. You never know why the zombies exist, where it started, etc... You don't need to, that's not the point. and 2) The running zombies. Purists HATE it. They want the old ""zombie shuffle."" What the hell is scary about that? How hard is it to outrun or drive away from shuffling zombies?!? This way, they're scary. More intense. They still can't work doors or machines or anything, but their base instincts of chasing their prey is all that drives them. The movie's just good horror fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Great remake, but doesn't beat the original.","While the movie is somewhat same with zombies and a mall, the actual story is completely different. The movie mostly focus on action pack which works in really well because the remake is entertaining and suspenseful throughout. The movie added some new things like fast zombies and new characters which somewhat works in. I do like the opening of the movie where it set the mood of it and have a creepy atmosphere to it. I also think the climax is both suspenseful and enjoyable with the vehicles they made to help them throughout their mission.I really don't like the found footage style during the credits because it feels unnecessary and it ends on a cliffhanger.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unique enough to be watched and enjoyed on its own merit,"Dawn of the Dead follows the same basic plot as George Romero's 1978 original. The dead are coming back to life to prey on the living. Amid the chaos a small miss-matched group of survivors escape to a shopping mall and use the building as a last line of defense against the swarms of zombies closing in on them. However, beyond this basic back bone the two films are markedly different in how they play out.This new film puts the emphasis on gore and action to drive its momentum. Contrast this with the original which stressed suspense much more effectively. The cast is also much larger than that of the original and as you'd imagine this gives considerably more fodder for elaborate death scenes. Unfortunately character development has been sacrificed considerably with only a few spouting enough personality for us to care much about them. Gone as well is the original's often scathing social commentary into consumerism and societal apathy. The new film also manages to be surprisingly humorous at times. The bit where Andy is shooting zombies from the rooftop who resemble celebrities is priceless.So is the remake as good as the original? No, but it offers enough new elements to merit its existence unlike the bulk of shallow ill-conceived remakes we've had to deal with lately. Give it shot.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent remake and a classic in its own right.,"Remakes of average films are most often disappointing and remakes of good films are frequently terrible. But Zack Snyder's 2004 remake of George Romero's :Dawn of the Dead"" ia a rare remake of a good film that succeeds in every way. I've been a Romero fan since I first saw ""Night of the Living Dead"" in the summer of 1968 and I was very doubtful about any attempt to redo its sequel, but this film convinced me otherwise. It avoided the obvious pitfall of literally remaking the older film by reimagining it instead. It kept the scenario of a group of people finding shelter in a shopping mall during a zombie apocalypse but only that. Even the zombies were changed from Romero's slow, lumbering zombies to ones like the fast running ""infected"" of ""28 Days Later"" released in 2002 (but kept them as reanimated dead, ignoring the rigor mortis problem). I find Romero's zombies creepier and prefer that style, but understand that for the sake of danger, the fast ones are a much greater threat, something an action version needed.Comparing the films is not very useful because they are trying to do different things and each succeeds in its way. Romero's film is more of a character study and Snyder's more of an action film. With four main characters in the 1978 film there was time to get to know them better. However, a small central cast can lead to the audience perception that the main characters will suffer no harm at least until the end. Snyder's group population totals 14 at one point, leaving room for some to die. This gives Snyder's film more tension. Snyder did not retain the social commentary/satire that Romero was famous for in his film. To be honest I never thought much of it because criticism of materialism and consumerism was a cliche at least since the late 60s and had been one of the main themes of the counterculture. The point is not whether I agree or disagree but simply the fact that there was nothing new or especially perceptive about it. What made it stand out to critics in the 70s was that it existed in a horror film, probably the least socially conscious genre imaginable. Repeating it would have made Snyder seem like a copycat. I greatly enjoy both films and so should anyone else.Snyder had been a director of television commercials and music videos (from Lizzie Borden and ZZ Top to Morrissey ) and ""Dawn of the Dead"" was his first feature film. It opened the door to a major directorial career, but along the way he became a very polarizing figure. Stepping into the world of comic books and superheroes where passions and opinions run very high, audiences are split between esteem and hatred of him. That's too much to go into here but since all of the characters here are new, he can not be accused of changing the characters too much from their source material the way he did with the DC Comics films. With an early background in art he has a strong sense in visuals and the look of this film is one of its strong points, the vibrant colors, the lighting and the camera placement are all excellent. (Note that in the opening clip showing four soldiers defending the U. S. Capitol Building, Snyder is the second soldier from the left, not wearing a helmet).His music video background gave him a sense of telling a story without a lot of talk. Its famous hair-raising 12-minute opening takes us from the quiet normality of leaving late from work and coming home to a loving husband and peaceful suburban neighborhood to complete chaos. This is shot as the view from Ana's fleeing car and from above it as fires and explosions are seen all around Milwaukee below. It's one of the best horror movie opening scenes ever. Right from the beginning the film has everything: pacing, camera angles, editing, storytelling, lighting and well-chosen music. There is so much going on, but it all flows smoothly. The story jumps ahead by finding the first group of five already at the mall, shown by simply raising the camera. It's the first morning of the outbreak, so the mall is not overrun with zombiesIt also helped that the people behind the film were actually into Romero's films and were out to inspire new fans for the zombie genre. Producer Eric Newman considered Romero's :Dawn"" as the top film of its type and was able to purchase the rights from the 1978 film's producer, Richard Rubinstein, who wouldn't sell until he was certain it was in the hands of people who cared. Principal writer was James Gunn, another Romero zombie enthusiast who was almost let go from the job when an internet storm arose over the fact that he had written two ""Scooby Doo"" films. Important fan site hosts were given previews of the script and told fans he was the right guy for the job. He has since gone on to direct all three ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" films.The actors were a bunch of relative newcomers (though two of them,Susan Polley and Kevin Zegers, had been child actors) and they played their parts earnestly without any sense of irony about being in a zombie film. Sarah Polley's Ana Clark is the original pov character and rather than running around screaming, is able to be calm and capable, all the while seeming vulnerable and shaken, like a real person would be. Ving Rhames is police sergeant Kenneth Hall and with his size and innate authority, becomes the operations commander of the group. Jake Weber is a recently divorced man who has worked a series of dead end jobs but finds real ability in himself and is also a group leader. These three make the important decisions but not without including everyone in the discussion.Ty Burrell was unknown at the time of the film, years before ""Modern Family"" and as Steve, is a sleazy, annoying jerk. Mekhi Phifer is streetwise Andre, trying to protect his pregnant wife, Luda, and turn his life around. Michael Kelly, later in all six seasons of ""House of Cards"" is CJ, a belligerent mall security cop whose big concern is that the survivors will shoplift items from the stores. . Kevin Zegers had been in the ""Air Bud"" films and here is the mall cop trainee, essentially the role of ""the kid"" with a good heart. There are more, and the number of roles means that some are people who we don't get to know much about, but this isn't the kind of film where you need to. The characters make some awful choices of what action to take in this film, often, one suspects, just to set up a new action scene. This is probably the greatest weakness of the film, but it tends to be a regular part of the genre. So does the fact that everyone seems to be able to shoot a gun with great accuracy.The special effects and makeup departments did exceptional jobs. Romero's focus had been on the people, not the zombies and even in 1978, his zombies were people with their faces painted a blueish gray. There had been ugly zombies since then, but they were more like fantasy ghouls (think ""Return of the Living Dead"") but the makeup team here, led by David Leroy Anderson, took it to another level. Snyder wanted everything to be as real as possible, so they researched physical decomposition in great detail using medical descriptions, photographs and time-lapse videos and made zombies look like the decaying corpses they actually would have been. The effects department created the scenes of the zombies outside the mall, who get ever more numerous each time they're shown.The zombie-mania which seems to finally have ebbed, produced scores of zombie movies (mostly bad) and the highly successful ""Walking Dead"" television series. Perhaps this film did help reignite interest in the genre which had waned after the eighties. It was wildly popular, opening at #1 at the box office (largely due to the opening sequence being shown as a preview on cable) and made back four times its budget. It remains one of the best films of its type, unlikely to be topped.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This movie was garbage. Crap.,"Wow, if there is ever a case for a movie which is completely pointless, useless, and a waste of everyone's time, it's King Kong 2005. Oh wait, wrong review. it's also 2004's ""Dawn of the Dead."" The new ""Dawn"" sucked on so many levels. It's yet another reason why most remakes should not be made. Poor direction, horrible script, bad actors, lame music...and this was supposed to be a remake of one of the greatest horror films ever made? It's like a joke.First of all, this wasn't scary at all. Horror means scary. You are supposed to be scared at a horror film. Nope. There was not a single instance in this film that was scary at all, none. Wasn't this the director's first film? Where'd they pick him up, eating lunch on 3rd street outside of NYU with all the other pretentious no-talents who attend there? Or did he save someone's life or something and being the director was his payback? Wow, the direction sucked.Second, the actors all sucked. The main black guy cop was a laugh riot. Trying to look tough, spurting out those badass lines...he was hysterical! So were the others for the most part, but he was the champ here.God, where to go from here...the music was a joke. The zombies all sucked. Running zombies suck. They looked OK here and there, but the running helps take away from the ""doomed"" atmosphere that was sorely lacking. I never felt there was the ""doom"" that the world was being taken over by the dead. Showing a million computer generated zombies doesn't do that, good film-making and direction does. So the zombies weren't scary, they were often pretty funny. The zombie baby was especially hilarious. So was the fat one chasing the blond in the mall.OK, let me be positive for a sec. There were only two whole good shots in the film - the little girl in the shadows in the house near the start, and one shot of the Russian woman as she's dead. That's it.Wow! It's a sex scene! Completely unneeded and out of place. Like most of the scenes probably.Some may say you can't compare this to the original. Why? Of course you can, it's the remake! The original is a classic because it had it all - great direction, scary atmosphere, decent soundtrack that added to the film, decent acting - unlike the new film which was poor on every level.What garbage. A complete waste of everyone's time. It really makes you wonder who is making these films these days and where they are learning their ""talent"" and craft. But hey. I'll end this on a positive note. I will say this about the film - as horrible as it was, it was better than ""28 Days."" Read my review on that ""great one"" when you get a chance.Nah, let's end this on a negative note, because crap like this movie deserves it. ""Dawn of the Dead"" 2004 sucked. Big time. Sucked.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bites its way into the top 20 horror movies ever,"I will admit I am not a huge fan of horror movies.  I decided to see this movie after seeing the first ten minutes previewed on channel 4.  It had me hooked and wanting to see more, as all movies should.  A very engaging and well done start.However, the rest of the movie, as i have found with many horror movies was a bit of a let down.  They seem to be full of wonderful thrilling moments that capture what seeing a movie in a cinema is all about.  Don't get me wrong it is a very good film, filling all of what is expected of a horror genre movie.  Am i wrong to want more from the genre?  I am beginning to think so after watching such recent horror movie's.Just as forgettable as it is fun.  A rollercoaster ride of a movie, but don't expect realism, innovation or any life changing moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely STUNNING remake!,"I really knew nothing of Dawn of the Dead 2004 until I saw the preview. No trailers, no TV spots, no hype. So I was quite surprised at how breathtaking it is, moving at a neck-breaking pace and not letting up on the gut-wrenching tension for the entire running time. The critics and majority of the audience agreed, something damn rare for a remake.While many remakes are easy, pointless cash-ins on previous success and a quick way to mooch a few dollars off fans, DOTD 2004 is something quite different. Both Dawn of the Dead movies are great for their own reasons. And while most will judge this a remake only and do nothing but compare it with its 1978 counterpart, it's really best to watch them a two separate stories happening at the same time.Young Nurse Ana (Sarah Polley) is living the suburban dream: perfect house, loving husband, well-manicured cul-de-sac. All that is about to change. As she drives home after a long shift dozens of clues surrounding the brewing trouble literally fall on deaf ears as Ana is too tired to notice. Overnight, her life is changed forever (as anyone's life can) when a lethal virus, that causes the dead to come back to life, spreads with alarming speed all over the world. Utterly, completely, hopelessly outnumbered, Ana flees her perfect life and hooks up with a bunch of other survivors who take refuge in a huge shopping mall.I will not pretend that the satire of the original is something of my own discovery (as so many, many other reviewers have) and complain that it's pretty much absent in the remake because DOTD 2004 has so many other levels to it.First of all, the zombies (the word is never mentioned in the film) can be seen as the perfect society. There is no conflict between them, no hate, no prejudice, and no grudges. They exist only to create more, as humans invariably do. The survivors barricaded in the shopping mall are rebels. They are refusing to conform and fight for their life, for their right to be different. And with this right to be different comes conflict and turmoil. The barricade between inside the mall and outside the mall is the line between the western world and the third world. Indulgent, ignorant and wasteful on one side and starving masses grabbing for whatever food they can on the other.DOTD 2004 offers a wider range of characters (more zombie nosh!) boarded up in the mall: cop, nurse, hoodlum, survivalist old lady, pregnant woman, security guards, gay guy, arrogant playboy millionaire, pretty girl and average Joe. It could be argued that they're a far more PC assortment of characters than the original (DOTD 1978 had 2 SWAT cops and 2 reporters-the very people we rely on to protect and inform us in times of crises-chickening out of their utterly futile duties to fend for themselves) but it ends up with character arcs and a sense of sticking together to survive, despite differences, that the original didn't have.The cast is well chosen and all act their parts brilliantly. Horror films have severely declined in recent years with most being turned into 20-something teen soap-opera trash. In DOTD 2004 you'll see a realistic group of people dealing enormous pressure with sense and reason. However, there is one particular moment in which a complete idiot character jeopardises the security for everyone else for the dumbest and stupidest of reasons. It really bugs me that this device is in the film and it damages DOTD 2004 and prevents it from having any everlasting integrity.There are a few references to the original (I'd hate to call them 'in-jokes' as that term would be kind of inappropriate for a film of this nature) that fans will have fun picking up on. But mostly the characters and situations featured in DOTD 2004 are completely new. The most interesting of which is the gun store owner across the street from the mall who communicates with Ving Rhames with his whiteboard and marker pen.Writer James Gunn (Scooby Doo, Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed) unleashes an entirely new monster this time. Many people have strongly complained at the 'fast zombie' type seen in this movie and (the absolutely awful) 28 Days Later. But they are far, far, FAR more terrifying than the slow, sluggish, rigger-mortis stricken corpses in the original. They'd be on you, ripping you're throat out before you can say 'crikey!' Yes, the 'turning times' vary wildly in the movie, but it all depends on the bite and how bad it is.I had never heard of Zack Snyder before seeing this movie, but for a debut feature he sure has impressed me. Every scene in this film is shot and lit from an identifiable point of view. This could be YOUR shopping mall in YOUR town. Not some fantasy happening far away. It's these kind of qualities that make DOTD 2004 stay with you longer than Darkness Falls or Scream 86. I'm glad that Hollywood can still make horror films as bloody and relentless as this, though there were several cuts made to the theatrical version.This new Directors Cut DVD runs 110 minutes and features more gore, bridging scenes, more character development, more violence and the odd restored shot here and there. It really is the definitive cut of the film to have and I urge you to buy this version.Filmed in Super-35 the DVD presents the film in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound. A truckload of extras include Commentary by director Zack Snyder and Producer Eric Newman, The Lost Tape: Andy's Terrifying Last Days Revealed, Special Bulletin: We Interrupt This Program!-complete news coverage of the attacks, deleted scenes, Raising the Dead and Attack of the Living Dead featurettes and Splitting Headaches: Anatomy of Exploding Heads.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Dawn of the Dead was great!,"I love this movie. Unlike all the CGI crap that passes for special effects these days, Dawn of the Dead (2004) is a breath of fresh air. Most of the special effects are done the old fashioned way, and it shows.This movie starts fast and doesn't let up. The cast is great, and it has characters you really care about. How often does that happen in horror movies today? Sarah Polly is great as the female lead, and Jake Weber is also great as the reluctant leader. Ving Rhames is tough as always, and every other cast member is very good.This movie is a great end of the world film, capitalizing on post 9-11 fears and bring Romeros legendary epic into the 21st century. It also is one the most nihilistic movies to come out of Hollywood in some time. It was actually scary too. I look forward to seeing more work from director Zack Synder.I own the directors unrated cut DVD which has some great extras, and some that are kind of cheesy too.

"Would be a 10, if it weren't for that one scene.","Dawn of the Dead is a classic, granted, there are cheesy scenes and cheese dialogue but keep in mind it is from 2004. I am trying to keep my nostalgia out of the review but it's hard not to, I grew up watching this movie and was terrified the first time I had seen it. The introduction to the film is masterclass, the credits in the beginning are undeniably chilling and eerie. If you haven't seen this film, I strongly urge you to, there is amazingly well done anxiety-ridden sequences. It is NOT the perfect zombie horror but the practical effects and costume design make up for some of the lack luster scenes in the film.Sarah Polley was likeable and obviously the strong female lead, and definitely a highlight much like the great Ving Rhames, heavily closed off and doesn't give a damn about the group, Michael Kelly as CJ was awesome, another character that was justifiably closed off and definitely was the movies go-to a**hole.I would stop reading if you don't want to be spoiled. I'm not going to mark it as a spoiler because it's just one scene and it's not worth marking it.The baby zombie scene was actually an abomination, if you believe that there is a scene in a film that could be removed, and nothing will change, chances are the scene is unnecessary. The zombie baby scene was absolutely unnecessary, there was no emotional attachment to Mekhi Phifer and his pregnant love companion, they were clearly a mere nuisance and added nothing to the plot.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Yee-Haa!!!,"Okay, first: this isn't as good as the Romero original. It does away with the vast majority of the thematic impact, symbolism and subtext. It's less distressing and less troubling.But it's absolutely fantastic entertainment. Zack Snyder gets much of the exposition out of the way a.s.a.p. and includes some impressive photography to demonstrate how the characters cloistered lives are about to explode with unfathomable events. Then he holds the survivors up in a deserted mall, surrounds them with the undead and lets the flesh fly. It takes a different enough approach to stand independently from the original.Sure, DotD doesn't show any great narrative flair. Of course its pacy and exciting, but is powered by incident: action sequences and dilemmas keep the action bowling along, not thematic issues. Furthermore, James Gunn's screenplay is fairly conventional and there are perhaps too many characters here. But I say again: it's fantastic fun.Crash, bang and wallop. People die in large numbers. Guns go blam. People do stupid stuff in Armageddon. And there is a bucket load of sick humour. Plus stupid gags about obesity and the cult of celebrity (DIE!!!).Those of sensitive disposition/easily offended would do well to avoid this because Snyder takes no prisoners and makes no concessions. This is tailor made for the anti-establishment or (more likely) the GoreHound Gang. Either way, you're in for a ball. The film has great energy in pushing things forward to an unpleasant conclusion, never relenting and constantly pounding you with sound and fury. Matthew F. Leonetti contributes great cinematography, shooting everything in an appropriately rotten colour pallet, Tyler Bates scores excoriating music and Ving Rhames (great) and Sarah Polley (just as good) go through hell with heads held high. And numerous obnoxious characters get scragged.I could give you a better idea of the scenario and story, but I won't. Just get the DVD, a load of friends, plenty of beer and Chinese take-away, sit back and relax  and be battered. Some may take that as a warning, so beware that this isn't a particularly pleasant experience.

It has all the morbid tension and sick feel of the first film. It also manages to add a few personal touches which makes it both original and even more scary then the first one. I love it!! I would love for more directors to do what Zhan have done for this one. I see nothing wrong in a good remake, especially if it steps away from the original and creates something new and better as this one does. Then again you don't really have to compare the two. The original have many things in it that this one can never live up to since that production is of a totally different nature.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Stick to the original,"If you are a fan of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" that was released in 1978 by superior zombie director George A. Romero, you won't like Remake. I consider The Dawn of the Dead 2004 to be one of the worst remakes in the history of filmaking.  Dawn of the Dead 2004 is nothing like the original it was intended to be remade in, on the contrary, its its own movie.  It should not have been called dawn of the dead.  The original Dawn of the dead had excellent character build and delicious old school make up effects by Tom Savini.  The zombies were slow and stupid hence the name ""zombie"".  The Remake has far too many characters to like, accept maybe Ken ( Vingh Rahmes).  The Remake also had a diffrent breed of zombies than the original, the fast zombie which is a rip off of 28 days later.  The original Dawn of the dead is actually a HORROR movie.  The remake is more of and action suspense movie.  If you want to see a beautiful candy colored zombie movie watch the original ( 10/10) if you want to watch an action/thriller/suspense/monster movie then watch the new dawn of the dead(-10/10) starring vingh rahmes and sarah polly.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
attack of the zombie marathon runners,"I've soured on horror films lately - aren't they just the most repulsive things ever? - and yet ""Dawn of the Dead"" won me over simply by being, well...exciting!  Most of the gore is confined to the first few minutes (the worst of it, anyway), and the rest of the film relies more on tension than violence.  So there's not too many long, lingering shots of people being eaten alive - thank goodness.Of course it's no masterpiece, but then again neither was the original (I don't think that a few comparisons between zombies and mall shoppers makes for an insightful social commentary!).  The main thing is that it's a bloody good siege story, and the characters - though thinly developed - are likable enough that you want them to survive.   I figured that Rhames and Polley would be good, but the surprise show-stealer here is Jake Weber's Michael, who distinguishes himself from the crowd by not shouting all the time.Huge gun battles, a pair of cool armored buses, and loads of tragic deaths keep the film rockin' on until the surprise climax, which is a bit too snide for me, but nonetheless effective.  I'm not sure I like the running zombies; they're very ""28 Days Later"" and very human-like in their movements, whereas the original lurching brand of zombie seemed more alien and therefore more frightening.  Still, faster zombies means extra action and a greater chance that the heroes will be caught, so there's both pluses and minuses to the new approach.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Eh, could have been worse...","When I first found out about this movie and it being a remake, I was like !@#$ this is going to be awful, considering mostly every horror remake I've seen has sucked hard.However when I popped this into the DVD, expecting horrible acting and scripting, I actually saw an entertaining movie that had some good moments...but it's just a bit silly...I mean just for comparability, I watched the original and it was a lot more serious. I mean, it had a much smoother story and was just more serious in my opinion. For example, in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Now to me, if you see a little girl with gray died skin, a half eaten mouth and her just !@#$ing standing there, not crying and !@#$, you don't go and try and help her, you just stay away from that !@#$.And the fact that ever since 28 days later came out with the 'running zombie' people now notice that this !@#$ is ten times scarier then the old walking zombie !@#$ no matter how many times George Romero tries to shove it down our throats that zombies shouldn't run because ""their ankles would brake."" !@#$, it's a !@#$ing zombie movie, I think we left physics behind when the dead suddenly started to walk.Now the script, the script isn't as bad as I thought it would be. However, compared to the original Dawn of The Dead, it seemed that they were rushing with the plot of something. I mean, 10 minutes into the movie and they're already in the mall. The rest of the script is o.k, not super, but an o.k However, by no means do I think the movie is bad. No. Just a bit silly.The original is a lot more serious however and will get more of a story out of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Shopping Maul.,"Having completed the Romero aspect of the pre-""Army of the Dead"" we're now going to pick up a few of the spares starting the Zack Snyder's calling card, his reimagining of ""Dawn of the Dead"". My recollection of the film was that I enjoyed it almost as much as the classic original and was happy to discover that this was still the case.Ana (Sarah Polley) awakes one morning to discover her neighbour's daughter in the house, confusion turns to horror when the zombified girl attacks and kills her husband. Fleeing for her life, she sees that her neighbourhood is being quickly overrun by the undead. Meeting a small group of survivors, she ends up at the local shopping mall. Despite the relative safety of the building, eventually the supplies start to run low and the group come up with a dangerous plan of escape.Though nearly twenty years old, ""Dawn of the Dead"" still stands up. It's really quite dark, with plenty of people, even children, meeting violent ends but somehow it still feels fun. It's a lot more of an action film than the original, and so rarely stops moving and has a couple of set pieces whilst the gang are at the mall, before leaving and heading for the conclusion. The zombies being ""28 Days Later"" fast ones works in differentiating this from others in the genre and the gore and CGI work is all pretty solid.As per a James Gunn script, I enjoyed the use of licenced music across the film. I would say that the characters aren't that memorable, certainly not compared the original.A lot of fun though, and for my money up there with ""Watchman"" as Zack Snyder's best film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good action movie, with Zombies","When I first heard the 1978 horror classic dawn of the dead would be remade, i felt pretty skeptical, knowing todays horror movie makers tendancies to neglect story and atmosphere in favour of cheap scares(monster jumps out and yells BOO!) and over the top computer generated effects.My first qualm when seeing this movie was 'running zombies', I felt this displayed a level of dexterity which shows them less like creepy 'living dead', and more like living people infected with cannibalistic urges, obviously an attempt to keep in touch with peoples new idea of zombies as seen in 28 days later, and though this leaves less room for tension it does allow for some exciting scenes and some visceral action, the characters arern't too imaginative, most of them we know nothing about(eccept that they will die),and the movies attempts at humor often fall flat because they are dropped in with little subtlety.On the plus side this movie really does look good, the make up and effects are convincing and the story has enough new material to keep you on you interested, though this isn't the thoughtful journey of survival or suspenseful horror that was the original, it is a pretty entertaining action movie which wont make you think, but will make you watch and listen.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""Get up, come on get down with the sickness!""","In 1978 George Romero presented us with the second film of the trilogy of the dead ""Dawn of the Dead"", as I was born in the 2000s I did not have the opportunity to follow at the time, but while watching in the present day I can not like it, yes I understand all its importance and criticism behind the cannibals stuck in the mall without any other way , but in my opinion he has aged poorly, both in practical effects, makeup and acting, but thanks to zack snyder's version I can appreciate the whole concept of the work!Of course, to this day we have the discussion about ordinary zombies vs fast zombies, and although many people believe that Zack was responsible for this concept, but it has existed since 1985 when ""The Return of the Living Dead"" came to us, so I prefer to say that what was established with this Remake was the frenzy of these monsters , which combines with the times when we lived in 2004, in fact combines much more in the present day, where it seems that nothing in our society has as virtue or principle patience, everything must be instant an instant or immediately, people act as animals or even as lifeless machines, regardless of the most basic things of life as ""human being"" above all.I think the only thing missing in the film that ends up getting inferior to the original are scenes showing the comodism and materialism of human characters when being trapped in that mall, if we analyze well there is not so many reasons to splother or panic the characters to be trapped in that place.The savagery that the human being can have with his fellowmen only by selfishness or resentment is also not exploited in the way he deserved, it is already consensus that in most apocalyptic works the greatest threat to a human being is himself, here this message ends up being resolved very quickly and forgotten during the course of the film, the idea that our society is sick becomes clearer in the music of the band Disturbed in the final credits than in the whole movie.I think in the end the proposal of the work is to put us in a state of total caution since only one mistake can cost his life and the well-being of his entire group, despite some attitudes without logic that some characters have the balance is positive and the film does well overall.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good horror, but not if you've seen the original","The film is too short at around 100 minutes, which with this subject matter it needs to be at least 2 hours long to allow character development,and to give some background to the events etc. Because of this you dont give two hoots for any of the characters, and they are playing it for laughs as well - no one looks very concerned and they all seem to be taking it in their stride, as if the dead come back to 'life' every day. So whats wrong with this film, here goes : the Zombies run - zombies should'nt run they are dead !, the female at the start of the film is chased by her zombie boyfriend who punches the windshield through on her car, but when the survivors are in the shopping mall the zombies cant break the entrance doors ??, there is no character development, and the film builds no sense of being trapped as in the original.There are too many survivors holed up in the shopping mall, characters are introduced and then not given any time to develop.In saying that if you have'nt seen the original you may well enjoy this movie - as a horror it is a good film, with plenty of action and good SFX. However the original was a GREAT film which makes this remake pale in comparison.It could've been so much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Solid effort,"This film is filled with tongue in cheek moments and gore. I really love the first 20 minutes where full on carnage pursues and depictions of how people react to the outbreak is well conceived. The lead characters although stereotyped, are an enjoyable mixture of people - not all of them likable or with development- but instead are known through their real-time behaviours, actions and choices, to denote the cowardly, from the brave.

the mall chainsaw/shotgun/crowbar/spike/hammer/propane/...massacre,"What a great word ""re-imagining"" is. Isn't that what they call Dawn of the Dead MMIV (2004)? A clever word indeed - it disguises the term that everyone has grown to hate, ""remake"" that is, and makes it almost sound as if the process of making one was creative and involved the imagination. Well, damn, was I misled. At least I was seduced more by the thought of countless gore and unbridled violence than by the idea of ""re-imagining,"" though it played a role.Still, why make a remake? Directors do it for only a few reasons really: to update a movie for a modern audience, or because they personally love the original and want to make a tribute to it. An homage, if you will. Nonetheless, it all generally (I do admit exceptions) boils down to one thing: stealing someone's idea and reshaping it (or ""re-imagining"" it) so that those who would never see it or understand it would pay money to see it. It's like Coles'/Cliffs' notes; dump everything in a blender, purify all that is more puzzling and curious and throw in a few artificial flavors. In other words, a great marketing scheme.So what's wrong with this one? Well, I'll start with what I liked. I liked the opening scenes. Thanks to CGI and a bigger budget we could actually get a grasp of the chaos of the zombie holocaust Romero tried to communicate in the original through minimalist means. We see the city in ruins, thousands of zombies: chaos and death. Two words that look beautiful on screen. Then it all falls apart.This set-up leads nowhere. The movie does what almost every remake does. It adds more of everything except character, atmosphere, and story. It's noisier, (in some sense) bloodier, and more full of main characters who appear only to die in nonsensical subplots. The setting, the mall which played a crucial role in the original film's story and theme, is purely coincidental. The idea communicated in Romero's film, the pure ecstatic joy of having ""a mall all to yourself as a fortress,"" is gone here. Further, this ""re-imagining"" has no moxie, no spirit, no balls. It assumes (probably quite rightly) that the audience has no attention span and doesn't bother to get us interested in the characters or the story. The film is rushed and misses the quieter interactions of the four characters of the original. You actually grew to care about those people in Romero's version because there was a certain realism to their existence despite the insanity outside the mall. Here, you don't care when or who goes: what matters is how they go.What else is their to say? The film is not scary. It has one or two ""jump"" scenes and it tries to make up for the rest with gore and loud special effects. As a story it's really too choppy to be followed and the conflicts between the characters are too underdeveloped to save it. The humor is also reduced to a few one-liners (and one really good character: Andy). After that, what remains? An ending that is plainly ridiculous and far inferior to the subdued, inevitable ambiguity of the original film. But, despite it being a pretty bad film (though not quite as bad as some other remakes), it should be remembered for one thing: it kicked The Passion of Christ from it's number one spot in the box office.

Wows With The Action,"I love the horror films of the 60's and 70's and the original George Romero zombie flicks are still some of my favorites but being that this is a re imagining I will try to stay away from comparisons. Okay the plot is very simple (even for a horror film) there is a deadly virus that has broken out over most of the U.S. that causes the victims to come back to life. So a band of survivors decide to take refuge in an abandoned shopping mall, I think that first and foremost this movie should be classified as an action film and not horror because there is plenty of ammo being shot and plenty of things exploding but not enough scares. Also things like character development are sorely lacking. The actors did a good job with the roles and the direction by Zah Snyder (Watchmen and 300) was good but as a die hard fan of the genre I can't call this a horror film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not Your Mother's Zombie Film,"To compare the two Dawn of the Dead films is unfair. Twenty five years have passed and there is no doubt that what passes for a R rated film today would have been X rated when the original came out (and vice versa). The two films also have very little in common other than the  basic premise.Where the original film had more than being scary on its mind this new film is more concerned with building tension. The zombies, instead of being slow moving beasts of the original, move with the speed of a track star, so there really is a reason to fear them, you either kill them or they will kill you giving you no time to run. This will either thrill you or make you scream in pain. Personally I think it works since it explains why things fall apart so fast.The new film, like the old film, is not with out its flaws, they just occur in different places.If you want to see a really good horror/action film that takes its source material and does something other tan resting on its laurels with it, see this movie. However, be warned it is as bloody as the first in its own way.8 out of 10 (which is what I'd give the original)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprising!,"Im not a massive fan of remakes (The Blob and Psycho anyone?). I avoided The Texas Chainsaw Masacre like the plague because the original is one of my favourite horror movies and dont even get me started on The Italian Job. Dont ask me why i went to see this one. The original Dawn of The Dead, even though it was overly long, was still a damn good film! I guess i was curious and i had heard good things about it (unlike Chainsaw).After watching it i can conclude that other than the fact that it's set in a shopping mall this is a very different beast to the original. There's more characters, more action and the Zombies are a hellovalot more scary! This is a cross between the original and 28 Days Later (which was also a damn good film). The fact that the Zombies can now run makes it more believable that they can take over the planet. They're just so relentless.The opening ten minutes of this film are possibly the most disturbing i have ever seen. i cant explain why just see the movie and find out.Like the original though this movie starts to drag in the middle. Although there are the odd moments that are disturbing or disgusting (or both, the Zombie baby is not a pleasent experience) that keep your attention until the final act, which ditches the horror aspect for all out action.This is where the movies major flaw lies as the end half hour is a mission to make you feel sick and its not because of the gore. Every shot is handheld and after the first five minutes you'll be craving for a break or attempting to keep you pop-corn in. It is very dissorientating and is only for people that dont suffer from motion sickness.The end of this movie does leave it open for a Day of The Dead remake to follow but how it will be done i dont know. As with every remake these days this is the very definition of the term ""re-imagining"" and if you're expecting the original walk away coz this is a totally different film and a damn good one at that.4/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead is a worthy remake of the original, making it scarier and gorier - a great zombie film","I'm going back to Zack Snyder's first film for a second viewing, I found the film to be a solid 7.5 back then and my opinion have changed to a small degree, I think it's better than that. With a lot more knowledge of both the zombie genre and Zack Snyder's filmography, I still think George Romero's original Dawn of the Dead is better but Zack Snyder created a worthy addition to the zombie genre and a remake true to the source material. James Gunn's screenplay is fantastic. With producers Eric Newman and Marc Abraham along, they knew exactly what they were doing and it worked well. With a well written script by James Gunn, the original's basic premise is instead oriented around the action genre and Snyder helped keeping every aspect of the production as grounded in reality as possible with help of the producers and Gunn. But this is the first time I've watched the director's cut of the film and it isn't that different, just more character development and more zombie gore. But the theatrical cut is still terrific, this version just adds on that brilliance.Set in Milwaukee, Dawn of the Dead follows a group of lone survivors who take refuge in an upscale suburban shopping mall during a zombie apocalypse. The survivors are mostly normal civilians like a nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman and other survivors. The cast has actors like Sarah Polley as Ana Clark, Ving Rhames as Sergeant Kenneth Rhodes, Jake Weber as Michael Shaunessy, Ty Burrell as Steve Markus and Michael Kelly as C. J, along with a couple of others.Many years went by before my first viewing and my second, still, I remember so many scenes. Zack Snyder have created a zombie film that you'll remember for many years to come as that's my experience. It's also a great remake or reimagining of the original film, I still think George Romero's Dawn of the Dead is better with its message and just being one of the best zombie films. Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead has great cinematography and Is visually a good looking movie. The pacing is perfect, with non stop action and suspension, makes for a film that will get your heart pumping. The choice of making the zombies able to run and smarter, makes for more a horror experience and honestly I was scared countless of times on my first viewing when I was new to the genre. Both the sound design and musical score plus soundtrack was brilliant. The special makeup effects for the film were created by Oscar winner David LeRoy Anderson and I have to admit, the work he does for this film is award worthy.Critics have said that this is Zack Snyder's best film and I don't really agree, but it's easily among his top five. I see that now. But I think it would have been even better if it was longer as it would have meant more character development but could easily made the pacing worse. The people behind this production and especially the director and writer wanted to make a grounded and suspenseful zombie film and they created one of the best zombie films out there, a flawed zombiefied masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Unoriginality at its peak.,"I just got back from seeing this film, and I am so revolted by it. I've been a big fan of zombie flicks from the past, especially the romero and fulci flicks and this movie just saddens me. All I could think was rip off of 28 days later, and ruining of the original dawn of the dead. Heck, the movie starts in a hospital, leads into a dramatic loneliness seen, then the alarm clock imagery followed up by riot footage and a red on black title sequence so similar to 28 days later - oh and not to mention they sped up the film half way through, and of course magically all the zombies were fast paced atheletes - even a bloated obese woman, it made me feel bad knowing this movie was made in a america with a much more bloated budget than that of 28 days later, a movie that I feel made some steps forward in a genre that hasn't hardly been improved on since the early 80s. This movie also consists of a ton of plot holes and loose ends. Ridiculous. Absolutely. Now the group of friends I saw it with said it was OK as a gore film, but being a zombie fan and recognizing whats been done and why made this movie falter so badly. There's a million one-liners, some funny scares, a couple tributes to the classics (cameo by savini, head zombie, baby zombie, etc.), but it doesn't really do them any justice with the film as a whole. I say, if you're a zombie movie fan and you don't want to waste the eight bucks I just wasted, wait for it to come out on video, maybe there'll be a good movie in the special features on the dvd, who knows.

This is one hell of a horror movie.,"This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"""Let's Go To the Mall!""","Great watch, will watch again, and can definitely recommend.Granted, if you're not a zombie fan, you're probably not even considering this one. Then you have the great argument about infection vectors (this is pretty classic, bite infection transfer), and slow vs fast (this movie is fast) zombies. I'm basically just pointing out why we can't have nice things, people argue about it.This has a great cast: Ving Rhames, Sarah Polley and Jake Weber in particular. The production value was definitely present, and not just in renting a mall to trash, or even just the zombie practical effects.The large scale scenes look amazing, and the details on the various infections are fascinating to watch. And sure, there is lots of quality gunfire (foley is good) and shooting zombies for people you are just in it for the action. While it's actually got some good (if dark at times) humor to it, it's not ""Warm Bodies"".Of course the presence of zombies / apocalyptic situation / lack of central authority gives us great philosophical opportunity to discuss what life means and see how people behave, but this leans more towards survival strategy aspects.If anything, I think that is where the ""flaw"" is in this movie: (most of) the characters are relatively competent so it detours some from typical movie formula relying on the characters to make mistakes to progress the story, but more of there is just a hopeless unending storm of bad things happening to them, it's honestly a little refreshing.This is probably one of my favorite zombie movies, and I don't even like running zombies.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Scary scary film,"Wow I went to see this at a special preview last night and it realy scared me and believe me ive seen a lot of horror movies.

I do feel  I need to say that I dont realy think that this should be classed as a remake as its very different from the original the mall is there but thats about it, its also closer in tone to something like 28 days later. I think that its not lacking when you compare it to the original because its different, where the original to me had an epic feel that was chilling as you realy felt that the problem was not just contained to the people in the mall, this movie was more action led and I felt that it focoused more on the characters we saw I didnt feel that there was a world outside that was ravaged by zombies. I also thought that a few of the characters in the remake were just there for fodder and had no real purpose as they were not developed.

Has Its Moments,"We take these sorts of movies pretty seriously here in Pittsburgh, the home of George Romero and where ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" were shot. (The shopping mall in the original is just a couple of miles from me.) I've just seen the '04 ""DOTD"" and have mixed feelings though more favorable than not. My first response was that the special effects getting better over the years is a mixed blessing -- you get that whiz-bang sense from seeing torsos chainsawed, but I think it makes directors a bit lazy in creating tension and fear.I'm reminded of ""Evil Dead 2,"" the Sam Raimi movie made on a shoestring budget that forced its creators to look for different, less extravagant ways of scaring people. I'd recommend it over this movie unless you're strictly a blood and gore fan. (And both movies have chainsaws!)

"Fresh, yet not fresh","First of all, I am a HUGE horror fan and I've been dying to see the new Dawn of the Dead. I hate to admit this, but I finally just saw it this weekend (5/22!!) You at least have to give me props for checking it out on the big screen, even if it was at the cheap-o movie theater. It was $3.75 well spent! Even though the movie was kind of scratchy because i guess it's made it's rounds, I was still pretty much into it.I'm a big fan of the original DOTD. I've owned it on video since high school and I've watched it a lot! So, I wanted to go into watching this remake with a clean slate. Even though I liked this remake, it did seem a lot like 28 Days Later, which I thought was better, but they are both still nothing crazily new or radical on the zombie genre [actually, I think 28 Days Later copied from the original DOTD].I don't think I'm giving too much away here (plus, if you haven't seen it yet and you're a horror fan, you're worse than me!!), but this is a warning that I might mention a couple of the killings. Anyway, the girl in the beginning who starts out as a nurse is very cute, in a girl next door kind of way. I know I recognize her from something else, but I think she is older and hotter now. Although, her husband in the beginning looks like he could be her dad. Showering with her. Creepy. I wonder what the director Zach's deal is? His directing was really cool, though.I like the opening when the nurse has to escape her own house and then drives through all hell breaking lose in their suburb and the camera keeps backing up further away and you see a car crash into the gas station and it blows up.Once they get trapped in the mall, I think the acting is really good, but I liked all mall stuff in the original DOTD better. But the acting and directing do lift the movie. I liked getting to know the characters and the tension of whose a zombie or not [that fat lady was so totally a zombie  how could they not figure that one out faster?] And, I want to pay mad props to Mhiki Pfieffer for getting his name in a Enimen song and delivering a zombie baby all in the span of one year!I Won't say what happens at the end [the very end] but I liked it. It was cool and wasn't like your typical Hollywood ending per se. So, in a nutshell... Too much like 28 Days Later, and nothing earth shatteringly new or fresh, but still a pretty cool movie, with good acting and directing. I say, go see it!!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Perfect Zombie Movie.,"For me, this is everything I want out of a zombie flick. It has the scares, it has the characters, it has the atmosphere and it has the gore. The zombies are the most frightening I've seen in anything zombie related. I also think this films does a mutch better job with the apocalyptic tone than the original and it really creates this hopeless feel that continues throughout the entire movie. The action sequences are also great and tense. It's literally impossible to find anything that I don't adore about this movie so that only leaves one more thing to say..I'm giving Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead a 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dawn of the Dead,"Dawn of the Dead tells the tale of zombies attacking a group of human survivors who take refuge inside a large shopping center. This is of course the remake to the amazing 1978 film by George A. Romero. While it has it's moments, this remake fails to match or surpass that original for a few reasons. Anyways, the movie begins with the world BEFORE the zombie invasion. We meet our ""main"" character Ana who is coming home from a shift at the hospital. She goes to bed with her husband and then is awoken to a little girl standing in the hallway. Yes, she is a zombie. It is a very tense and creepy opening scene. That's when the excitement begins and Ana takes herself to safety at the mall.Other than the fact that it's a zombie film and it's location is inside of a large shopping mall, the Dawn of the Dead remake is very different from the original (which I liked a lot). This one had a much bigger budget and a more well known cast, but wasn't as good as the 1978 version. It's a good movie but failed to surpass the original. I HATE the fact that zombies can run, it takes away from the eerie moments we witnessed in the original 'Dead' films. Them running does add some intensity to a few scenes, but it just isn't the same as the 1978 version.'Dawn of the Dead (2004)' does have some creepy moments, and of course has gore galore. But it doesn't have the same charm the original had. This should be seen by all horror/zombie fans as it is a good entry to the genre.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than I guessed it would be,"I am writing this as a fan of artsy fartsy visual storytelling rather than one who loves gory graphical horror, or the zombie theme as a whole. I can't say i disliked DOD '04, although I don't think it is as masterful as the original. Keep in mind that DOD and DOD '04 are hard to compare since they definitely differ a lot in style and audiovisual expression as well as plot-wise. Perhaps Romero would have liked the possibilities new technology in film-making has brought with it, but the '78'er's the big advantage over 04 is the fact that horror easily gets a bit pathetic and not scary.A zombie model '04 is a remarkably scarier creature than its cousin of 1978; it moves as fast, or even faster than a living human and is a goal-oriented killing/eating machine. Thus one of the main points in the original movie is lost. The inefficient, slow ex-consumer stuck in a circle of reliving old habits and instincts in the mall of the '78 version is long gone, while horror movie clichés are planted everywhere. There is, however a very good take on the consumerism of today still left, revised but intact, and that sort of saves this new version from being gory rubbish, at least seen from an artistic and social commentary oriented point of view.The very important words Us & Them and the them still have their meaning here, but sadly, in a way, the threat of other human beings in the ""chaotic end of the world zombie takeover""-sort of situation is in a way replaced by raging zombies that are pure monsters rather than stupid corpses suffering from hyperactivity The acting is, I think, more professional, even if not always much convincing here in Zack Snyder's version. I can, however say that I liked the urban, cynical, rich, modern, pathetic asshole (""Steve"") played by Ty Burrell. Visually its prettier and creepier and more dramatic but also introduces the risk of too much action, which there definitely is. Together with the industrial heavy metal inspired soundtrack the taste of splashy, mediocre horror is present, luckily combined with an interesting picture of life in the early 00's. It's also sad that the sound mix didn't have what it takes to boost horror.Through the movie we get the chance to compare dignified deaths, stupid deaths and the messy deaths of fighters, but the outcome is always the same in a meaningless way that very well concludes the whole mood of the film, where the viewer can observe the danger of the most loved but always lying part of the human imagination: Hope.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Pure Entertainment...,"OK, remakes haven't the same merit than the original thing and the most of the times are unnecessary and quite worst than the movie they're ""remaking"". However, there're exceptions to that rule, and Dawn Of The Dead (2004) is one of those.The starting point is the same as in George A. Romero's version: a group of people take refuge from the attack of the living dead in a shopping centre. But there're some differences that makes this remake much better and much frantic than the 1978's Dawn Of The Dead:1) It's not as long as the first version. Almost 40 minutes shorter.2) The living dead are fast as hell, which makes them much more terrorific.3) This movie is pure action, there's not a second's break.4) The use of digital cameras intensify the action scenes (especially to the of the movie)5) Obviously they've spent much more money than Romero did. Spending more money doesn't mean that you're gonna make a better film; but in this case it does.6) There're no easy frights.7) (This may not be an advantage) Is not as darker an oppressive as the first version.Well, that's it. No pretensions but to make you have a funny-cary time. Zack Snyder definitely achieves that.My rate: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Give me a break...,"I just saw Dawn of the Dead and all I have to say is, GIVE ME A BREAK! The movie begins with some ""unknown"" virus that reanimates the dead who are infected, fine that makes for an interesting Zombie movie.  This epidemic is apparently world wide, although the cause is never actually revealed. They continually make reference to the armed forces and how they are trying to contain these creatures.  The United States military was subdued and virtually annihilated in one days' time.  You learn in the movie that ""Fort Pastor"", the army base near this city, is destroyed and is a ""blood bath"". In other words the United States Military armed with armored tanks, Assault Rifles, and Air Support, is less suited to the task of fighting these creatures then 6 average joes wielding pistols and shotguns.  Oh yea...and let's leave the safety of the mall to drive to some Island out in the middle of no where.  This movie takes place in Milwaukee?  Apparently there are tropical Islands out on Lake Michigan now...and how exactly did those creatures get to that Island or infect it?  Weren't they supposed to be mechanically illiterate? So boats are ruled out? and they cannot swim....This movie is littered with holes, save your money!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good film, unfortunately with some flaws.","Now this is a film you don't get to see every day! The mere fact that this film's a remake and does only suck a little makes it special, but what nearly a real gem these days, if there weren't those stupid flaws I mean, is the exclusion of clichés (well, the most of 'em). Like, if this was the typical profit-oriented, no-room-for-artsy-stuff flick, it would drown with the other crappy attempts to make money of abusing the good reputation and cult of its originals. But actually, this one succeeds in combining modern video-clip aesthetics with effective cinematography and good storytelling.The films first ten minutes are hilarious. Not only because the opening begins with the end of the world right away, but also because the credits begin not until those ten minutes. Another plus is the avoidance of any explanations for the zombie-phenomenon and, oh the word ""zombie"" isn't mentioned at all! It's disappointing, to be honest, that the heroes don't coincidentally find a book, left on a table somewhere, that describes them how to get rid of the plague and that standard lines, like ""I won't leave you here!"", are missing. Well, for the satirical aspect: it is really ironic seeing that, with the problems that come from the 4th amendment, only gun carrying people survive at the beginning - Matt Groening will probably like this message. What unfortunately really flaws the film and nearly destroys it, if there weren't those action-packed scenes following after, is firstly the aspect of everyone shooting the zombies in the head (the only way to kill them) with a near 99% accuracy, which is something one can live with since only gun-crazy people survive the attacks and reach the mall. Secondly, there is a scene which really is ridiculous (and I don't mind spoiling it), where a woman risks her life for a dog and after that having everyone risk their lives for the same stupid woman. What also bothered me was the Character of Steve, whose job is nothing but being an asshole and - surprise! - dying at the end, leaving all the ""good guys"" to survive. But aside from that, it is a really good film which has its moments - whether they are funny, action-loaded or exciting.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Those darn Zombies again!,"'Dawn' always was the most appealing of the Romero trilogy, so I guess they made a good choice remaking this one.The movie starts literally like a blast. When coming home from work Ana (Sarah Polley) finds her husband becoming a zombie after being bit by a little girl. She flees with her car while around her the neighbourhood and the whole city collapses. Fantastic heli shots in this one, you should see the movie just for that.She then meets up with a group of people, and they all get trapped inside a mall while thousands of zombies try to get in, like in the original. Of course not everybody will make the end alive...There's some pretty gory shots in this one (check out the birth!), but it's all great fun.

Zack Snyder and James Gunn team up for a reinvention of the zombie genre.,"Some day I need to go through more zombie films because I want to know where it stopped being about humanity and turned into action films with zombies.Zack Snyder's first feature film as director and he picks a remake of the classic zombie movie. Really an interesting endeavor for a guy with commercial and music video experience prior. But his color pallete and cinematography are clearly very distinct and from the go I see he had a fondness for whatever this visual style is.Not sure why James Gunn and co. Decided to ditch everything interesting about the original and just make an action film but I guess it works for the director they hired (such an interesting career trajectory for these two btw).Really this one is just watchable with nothing special. I'm glad it isn't terrible but that is a low bar. Now I understand why I never liked zombie films much growing up.I didn't realize until maybe 30 minutes into this that I had already seen this before, as a kid. Zack Snyder's style burned moments of this film into my memory.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Well, what do I have to say? VERY good","Well, I remember renting Dawn of the Dead last year on video after reading some enthusiastic reviews and hearing about other zombie flicks. Well, I borrowed it... and I was blown away. Just like when I borrowed Braindead a few months earlier.Dawn of the Dead is a very good zombie film. The plot is almost identical to the original (which I am currently trying to watch), and it makes for very good viewing. Even more amazing about the film is the fact that it is a DIRECTORIAL DEBUT. How about that?!Well, if you haven't seen it, here is the plot: Something - a virus, possibly; it is never explained - is causing the dead to rise. Not just in a small area, but worldwide. Spreading like wildfire, anybody bitten by one of these things will transform anywhere from a few minutes to a few days later. And these things need to feast on the flesh of the living. A group of survivors, including a nurse, a cop and a pregnant woman (and a guy that sells TV's at Best Buy) take refuge in a massive shopping centre.Well, that's all I am revealing for now.The opening sequence - which is one of the most breathtaking I have ever seen - is slightly more edgy than the rest of the film. But just slightly. Ever so slightly.Some classic moments - the ""flying"" zombie, for instance - are just ingenious. Again, I am not spoiling it.You want a good way to pass a lonely Saturday night?

"""Updated"" in more ways than one","George Romero's original ""Dawn of the Dead"" is a classic, hands down. It is a fine, thoughtful movie. The characters are carefully meshed out and developed over the course of the narrative, beyond that, Romero's dramatic decisions make sense, he only uses four main characters to propel his story. The remake, on the other hand (one can only hope that Romero made some money from this, which would be the only justification), is a stock 00s Hollywood product: utterly soulless and moronic from the first frame to the last. The characters are stereotypes and at times bizarre (armed security guards in a mall?), the action perfunctory and essentially pornographic in its lack of relation to the story itself. The screenwriter decides to toss in some smarmy, obnoxious characters straight out of a bad 1980s teen sex romp. Annoying, smart ass yuppie? Check. Hard ass rent a cop security guards/morons? Check. Useless characters who stand around for ten minutes acting surprised that the zombies that have been attacking them for the last few days are, in fact, attacking once again? Check. Characters are uniformly good shots (none of the tension in the first film from SWAT members vs. the macho but inexperienced helicopter pilot) able to adjust their aim and ""shoot 'em in the head"". In the first film the characters planned and executed schemes to the best of their abilities, in this one a bunch of idiots run around like headless chickens flailing about wildly from one ill conceived plan to another. Thank you again, Hollywood, for doing your part to spoil a movie for young movie goers who will now make no attempt to see the original, since this remake is so ""totally awesome 'cause like a zombie like gets totally stabbed in the head"". Its as if serious film goers have committed some grievous collective sin and are all being punished in some massive, communal private hell. At least Ken Foree, Scott Reiniger and Tom Savini made a few bucks appearing in it.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
How would you enjoy waking up in hell?,"After having seen plenty of movies with this basic concept in which people hide in a mall for mutated creatures, I can say this was a good watch. Though I have seen better movies about strange mutants and dangerous viruses this one was certainly worth my time. I have seen this movie recently but have watched and enjoyed alike movies before. Films such as the Resident Evil series can easily be compared to Dawn of the Dead.The movie and actors themselves manage to express the human emotions and thoughts at the brink of destruction very well. ""Who to trust and who not"" is an essential thought. Leaving your loved ones for the sake of your own life. It's all about certain decisions we have to make. However there is a lot of pain and misery, you will for sure not miss the several funny scenes spread over the movie.One point of critic I have to make is the sometimes what awkward scenes that come out of nowhere. For instance, I did expect certain elements as nudity to stay away. Also did I not enjoy the movie as a horror movie at all, it had way more thrill than horror.So if you have a night free and want to enjoy a good movie? Dawn of the Dead will be at your service.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly very good,"Reimaging of the 1979 horror classic.  The dead rise and begin to attack and eat the living who, in turn, also rise and join them.  A group of people are holed up in a huge shopping mall...but how will they get out with it surrounded by hundreds of flesh-eating dead people?It's not as good as the original but damn close (I'm giving it a 9).  Then again, it couldn't be as good.  The original was a ground-breaker--it was the first unrated horror film to play in first-run theatres.  Also, for 1979, the amount of gore was just staggering.  Nobody had ever seen anything like this!  Also it wasn't just a horror film--it was also a satire on American consumerism.This one totally drops the satire (not a bad idea) and just goes full speed ahead with action, adventure and gore.  It's not as gory as the original, but it definetely pushes the level for an R-rated film.  DO NOT see this if you're squeamish.The acting is just so-so--even the great Sarah Polley seems muted!  But really--who sees this for the acting?  It's scary, fast and violent and also the dead, this time around, move MUCH quicker (and are often filmed running in fast motion which is truly scary).  It does have its slow moments but those are few.  And I REALLY hated the ending.Still, well worth seeing for horror fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good suspense thriller,"There are good elements to this film and some bad ones. First of all, the bad ones. I think that some of the scenes were completely predictable and unrealistic, and the only reason the were put into the film was for the suspense effect. I believe that even the smallest flaw in a film, can ruin a film overall, and this film certainly had many of them. Despite these small flaws, the film had impressive elements like a creepy almost surreal atmosphere, that gave you the sense of what it's like to live in a nightmare. I enjoyed the consistency of the action, which kept me thrilled throughout the film. Overall the film was a good suspense thriller which could had been better if there had been a little more ambition.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mindless Zombie-entertainment,"""When there is no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth!""Before watching Zack Snyder's new zombie-film ""Dawn Of The Dead"", I was a little bothered by the fact that I haven't seen any of the films in George Romero classic zombie-trilogy (Night Of The Living Dead, Dawn Of The Dead, Day Of The Dead), and as most people know, this film is a remake of one of Romero's films. I'm the kind of person that doesn't like that people is making remakes, and especially not remakes of classic films. I haven't seen ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2004"" yet, but the original from 1974 is one of my favorite horror-movies. But since I haven't seen the original ""Dawn Of The Dead"" (1978), I wasn't THAT skeptical when I decided to watch this film, and after all...I didn't really expect more from this film than great entertainment.This film takes place in a town where people, one day, wakes up to a invasion by flesh-hungry zombies. We follow a group of people who seeks cover in a mall. The zombies doesn't manage to get into the mall, but the people know that they can't stay there forever and they starts planning what they should do to survive.Even though I haven't seen too many of them, zombie-films aren't exactly my favorites. Peter Jackson's ""Braindead"" (1992) is the only one I've seen that I really like, but the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy is on my ""to-be-watched"" list. Still, it's a fact that ""Dawn Of The Dead"" is a very entertaining film with some interesting elements. It doesn't have the deepest story I've ever heard about, but it has just enough of the ingredients that should satisfy someone who would like to watch a zombie-film: lots of gore, thrilling scenes, a little humor and action from beginning to end.Zack Snyder has done a approved job with this movie, and he has made a very modern-style zombie-film. When it comes to the camera-work and the zombies, he seems to be heavily inspired by British director Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later"" (2002). This is not the ""good old"" zombies that were slow and stupid, and that you could almost have a cup of tea in front of, before they got close enough to grab you. These zombies are just as fast as human beings, and if you don't pay attention, you may have one in your throat before you know it. This makes the zombies more scary, off course.Among the actors in the cast, there wasn't anyone who impressed me. Ving Rhames is the only one I really know, and he delivered one of the best performances. But I wasn't expecting the actors to be catching the most of my attention, and they're doing a good enough job based on a script with restricted character-portrayal and development.""Dawn Of The Dead"" is popcorn-entertainment. Not much depth or intelligence, just Action from beginning to end. Zack Snyder has made a debut-movie, which is refreshing compared to all the mediocre Hollywood horror-films we have been drowned in for several years now. It has charm and gives the viewers exactly what they want. Yeah, we might see some good films from Snyder in the future.7.5 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Boy, does this rule!!!","I've seen the original Dawn a billion times. I specifically remember renting it from MAJOR VIDEO in 1983. I was 8 years old. The shocking gore gave me nightmares. When I was 13, I bought my own VHS copy. AT 21 I got the laserdisc for Christmas-still have it. I eventually bought the many DVD incarnations...etc. My point is this: I KNOW((and really love)the zombie genre, and I was weary of this remake. Why remake perfection? Because the lame action movie ""28 days later""(whatever 14-year old girl was quoted as saying it was the scariest horror film since the EXORCIST was retarded) made money? I feared this remake would suck. Well, it does not suck. It is,in fact, one of the top zombie flix, ever. DOTD 04' is a frightening, post 9/11 re-think of the classic original. The zombies are scary, not to mention fast. The first 20 minutes pull you in, and the sharp direction, acting, script, and editing keep you on edge. This is potent fun, with moments of sharp humor; as well as a strong sense of apocalyptic paranoia. This well-worthy rethink of the original is a blast.

It's seems movies with underlying, yet obvious, motives are far more entertaining than straight action. This is also true of the brilliant 28 Days Later, although in a different, less humorous way. This by no means implies that I don't enjoy or like the film, it just doesn't hold a candle to the original.

Good zombie horror movie....,I thought that Dawn Of The Dead was a good horror film. It is about a young nurse named Ana who is returning from a hard day at work. wanting to go home and see her husband Louis. But not paying attention to an emergency broadcast telling the public about a deadly plague of flesh eating creatures. Until the next day when the next door neighbour a little girl comes into their house and bites Ana's husband Louis in the neck. But Louis does not stay dead. later he is up and trying to bite his wife Ana. Ana manages to escape in her car and sees members of the public being eaten by flesh eating zombies. She crashes into a tree. she is recovered by a black police officer called Kenneth. They group up with 3 more people and find shelter in a shopping mall called the Crossroads Mall. While they are in the mall they find 3 security guards there armed with guns. They wait for help to arrive But they are all running out of time and the zombies are approaching the mall. The dead are retuning to roam the earth. I thought that this was a very good zombie horror film with great acting from the cast. 7/10,7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"As a zombie myself, I must say, this movie was quite entertaining, albeit a bit frightening.","Uggghh...brains...zzzz....what was I supposed to do again? Oh right, review the movie Dawn of the Dead.The movie starts off with chaos erupting as a mysterious virus turns humans into flesh-eating zombies. I found the depiction of the virus quite accurate, as I myself have experienced the feeling of being consumed by an insatiable hunger for human flesh. The scenes of the zombies attacking the living were also quite realistic, and I must admit, I felt a sense of satisfaction watching my fellow zombies chow down on some tasty human snacks.The movie takes place in a shopping mall, which I found to be an interesting choice of setting. As a zombie, I have never really understood the concept of shopping, but it was amusing to watch the humans try to barricade themselves in the mall to escape the zombie hordes. The scenes of the humans fortifying their positions and defending themselves against the zombies were quite exciting, and I found myself rooting for both sides at times.I must say that I quite enjoyed watching Dawn of the Dead. The movie offered a fresh take on the zombie genre, and I appreciated the attention to detail in the depiction of the virus and the zombie behavior.

A Smashing Debut by Zack Snyder.,"This remake of Dawn of the Dead is everything a zombie fan could ask for. With the script from James Gunn and directions from Zack, the movie is marked as one of the classics.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Another remake, but at least Dawn isn't all that bad.","Hollywood is suffering from a new disease...........remakeitis! So far in 2004, we have seen remakes of Flight of the Phoenix, Stepford Wives, Walking Tall and Dawn of the Dead. And their are more to come in 2005, which tells me that ideas are scarce in Hollywood. I'm not dogging remakes. But with the increase we have seen just in the last few years, I really am starting to worry that studios are abandoning ""original"" ideas. In any case, when I heard that Dawn was going to be remade, my first thought was that it really couldn't be any worse than the original. I know the original Dawn has a cult-like following, but in all honesty that film is not very good.So..........what about the 2004 version? Well, let me say this. The remake is good, when you compare it to the original. But, I do have several problems with this film. I'll get to those in a second. Let me address the positives.First of all, this film does not follow the original in every detail. Most remakes don't, but for Dawn this was actually the best choice. Dawn is all about one thing...........survival. We have a group of people that are simply trying to survive. I like the fact that the group becomes a family of sorts, realizing that they need one another to survive. I also liked how Ving Rhames was the only true bad-ass in the film. He is a cop, so it is to be expected. But Rhames (as he usually does) plays this part so well that you love it when he starts to accumulate a high body count of zombies. I liked the diversity of characters. A salesman, a nurse, a gay organ player for a church, a playboy, a jerk security guard...........as that diversity meshes really well in this film. I also liked how in the midst of all the chaos, the characters get to know one another, meaning we get to know who they are. A lot of time, films like Dawn look past this aspect. I'm glad the director didn't do that. And then their is the segment that had me rolling..........and for you Disturbed fans out their, you know what I am talking about. Using Disturbed's ""The Sickness"", they had some guy singing the song in a Frank Sinatra style that just was so funny, I had to play the over again. It is pure genius to use this song in the film, but to do it in this way was just so damn funny.Now, the bad stuff. I guess their is a handbook out their entitled ""What to do when Zombies attack"". And in that book, the author must have stated that the first place to seek shelter is..........The Mall! And wouldn't you know, the zombies must have known this (or maybe the author turned into a zombie and told all his zombie buddies that survivors will flock to the mall) cause right before our group of survivors can get into the mall, the zombies show up. Okay, I can live with this. But I refuse to accept that mall security guards will be packing heat. In Dawn, the security guys are packing, which was a terrible thing to have in the film. Then, this movie wasted Mekhi Phiefer's talents. If you watch ER, then you know this guy is one hell of an actor. Here, he is wasted. Lastly, this film is not a horror movie. It is an action film with zombies. Their really isn't anything scary about this film. The zombies look great, meaning they look hideous and scary. But the film is not a horror film.Overall, Dawn is good for what it is, and it is actually a remake that is better than the original. Having Rhames as the lead character was a great call, cause anybody else in that role just wouldn't work. I think Ving is one of the most under-appreciated actors today. But I also have to mention Jake Weber, mostly because I hope this film will give him more exposure. The guy is a great talent, and he plays his part so well that you really feel for him in the end. Those two made this movie for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Note to Rob Zombie: this is how you do an homage.,"Zombie to-do list:1. Eat brains2. Moan a lot3. Look messed up4. MEmnNASmAMmNa UHHhhhuhhh5. Eat brainsGone is the subtle, serious horror of Romero's Night of the Living Dead; fortunately, it's been replaced with funny, suspenseful, and action-packed scenes. It plays kind of like a Resident Evil video game, which may or may not be appealing to you. I thought it kicked ass.This movie jumps right into the action, giving you only about 3 minutes of background and build-up. Anna (played by Canuck Sarah Polley) is a nurse, people start turning into Zombies, and she high-tails it out of her neighborhood. It sounds terse, but it all happens about that fast. She meets up with a few other survivors, and they hide out in the local mall, fighting for survival. Sure, they're stuck in a shopping mall, hiding from hordes of vicious zombies, but think of all the great stuff they can get at Sears!The oddest thing about this movie is, after we left, I actually had a discussion with my girlfriend about whether or not I would ""kill"" her if she turned into a zombie. Yes, an actual conversation. I couldn't convince her that the only things on a zombie's mind are ""Eat brains"" and ""MEmnNASmAMmNa UHHhhhuhhh""; she was upset that I would do my duty to humanity and destroy the undead version of her.I think a milestone in any relationship is when you can come to terms with the fact that your partner would eradicate your living corpse - I think I stole that from a Hallmark card.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Cancell the Academy Awards, we have a winner!","The action settles in an abandoned shopping mall, where Anna, a police officer named Kenneth and a few other survivors - gun-toting Andre, his pregnant girlfriend Luda and mysterious Mike. In the mall they are confronted by the local security, who suddenly have delusions of power. The group winds up locked in a home furnishings store before turning tables on the rent-a-cops. Setting up shop in the mall, they have a little fun, playing basketball and working out with gear from the sports store.Most comical is Ken forming a bond with a gun store owner across the street named Andy, with the two communicating by writing on erasable message boards. They play chess and take pot shots at the horde of zombies below them for laughs. In a true sign of a sick mind at work, there's a montage of mayhem done to a lounge band covering The Disturbed's ""The Sickness."" Snyder is crazy, and I love it.The strongest character studies in the film show how people react under pressure as society collapses. We see it in the rent-a-cops trying to display power they don't really have, and in the development of Michael, who shows strength of character despite a less-than-impressive background.Like many, I found myself anxious about the news that Dawn was being remade. I wasn't particularly worried about the choice of director or screenwriter (like some outspoken folks). I was more concerned with the ""uber-stupid-teenification"" that seems to haunt most of the decent ideas that surface in cinema nowadays - particularly in horror films.That said, there were a couple instances in the new Dawn that I could've lived without. But they were easily forgotten amidst the ruthless spectacle of these very determined survivors in a shopping mall.Romero fans and newcomers alike should be pleased. The violence is huge, And the gore, sweesh, it was very gory at times. It was simply very well done.And for all of you people who are upset over the running zombies, just get over it already.I'm a big fan of the original. ""But the bottom line is this: lumbering, staggering, slow-moving zombies just aren't scary anymore folks. They scare your grandma, but not us anymore. It's been almost 30 years. We have to be ...

Blame Hollywood,"Let's get something out of the way first and that is as a director George A Romero is way down there with Ed Wood . The technical aspects like editing and sound are awful while his cast are so wooden you'll get splinters from picking up a DVD of one of his films .But as both a producer and screenwriter he credits his audience with great respect and his films are unusually sophisticated and intelligent with DAWN OF THE DEAD being his masterwork . It's a film that pre-dates gore fests from the 1980s while at the same time mirroring the haunting novels of 1950s British apocalypse writers like John Wyndham and John Christopher and this level of sophistication I remember the original film for .It's difficult to know who to blame for this farce entitled DAWN OF THE DEAD . Romero doesn't have a producer credit and it shows . Zack Snyder later went on to direct 300 , one of the most aesthetically pleasing and remarkable films of recent years . But there's little here that is pleasing . A lot people have suggested 28 DAYS LATER rips off Romero but I wonder what these critics will say when they realise the zombies in this film are able to run like an Olympic runner ? Something along the lines of "" Well it was filmed in Canada so as a tribute to the Canadians they're a homage to Ben Johnson hence their rapid running ability "" . Don't patronise me because the zombies here are a homage to Danny Boyle rather than RomeroUnfortunately Hollywood being Hollywood everything is about money so it's not difficult to see the motives behind remaking this horror classic . The technical term for this is "" Making a fast buck "" , also known as "" Making a bad film but it doesn't really matter because schmucks will buy their tickets before word of mouth causes the movie to disappear from the box office "" , so don't blame Canada - blame Hollywood",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Special Appreciation,"Now I admit, when my friends wanted to see this movie, I really didnt want to go with them. This movie didnt really look that entertaining, and the zombie genre has been done before. But I had nothing else to do that day, so we bought tickets to Hidalgo and snuck into Dawn Of The Dead. Now, the movie takes place in Wisconsin, and actually mentions the city where I live, and I was completely shocked. I dont think you would realize how awesome it is to hear recognition for where you live when you dont get recognized that much. The movie, although sometimes unrealistic, is overall enjoyable. It has its funny moments, and moment where you question the actors choice. Example: Why the hell would you drive through a crowd of zombies to save a dog? Stupidity as its greatest. But in any case, the effects were good, and this is a good way to spend 2 hours, so I recommend going out and seeing this movie, and visit Waukesha sometime soon.

Zombie Extreme with a New Touch,"Zombies. The genre of zombies when being A class is a delight on suspense. With this movie, set upon current times, delimiters a narrow, smart premise that makes you wonder what would you do in such situation of devastation and terror, where would you go, it immediately grips you and holds you praising for the survival of the ""not zombies"".The gruesome but excellent make-up sets a standard of classy directing and the story does focus on another sight: the survivors. I think its nice to see how the human stories develop in such a tremendous and scary context. However, this is not it. Do not be fooled. You will find zombies, tense situations, and funny situations as well. Its a great movie for the cult, a nasty good addition.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
OK zombie action film,"A pack of humans barricade themselves in a mall, when it becomes apparent that the dead are now zombies, walking the earth, and in need of flesh to eat.When the first 'Dawn' came out in the 70's, it was a pretty original zombie film. It depicted a social satire, comparing us with the zombies. We are, after all, a world run by advertisements, by TV, and by everyone else in the media. Why not wind up in the mall with everyone else? Zombies are shown in all their glory, moaning and groaning about. They are as much part of the movies as the humans are, and there's even a bit of humor about them.But not in the new version. The social message is thrown away, for the most part. Zombies in here are secondary. There's nothing funny about them. But there's plenty of action, and that's what this movie boils down to, an action packed-zombie fest.So we are really looking at 2 different films here, with the only relationship being is that the humans shut themselves in a mall for safety. The earlier version is more violent & scarier, if a bit more preachy. I also liked the ending of the first one far better then this one. I won't reveal, but it's a distinctive flavor between possible hope and utter despair.But those looking for a violent zombie action movie can't go wrong with this. It's better then Resident Evil, IMHO.If you get the DVD, don't miss some of the extras ""The Lost Tape: Over 15 Minutes of Terrifying Footage Revealed"", where poor Andy shows us in a video his last few days of life.Now, If your looking for a better 'zombie' type of movie, take a look at '28 days Later'",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
You Know what....,"I'm really starting to come around to remakes... At first I hated this movie, and i hated the Texas Chainsaw Massacre even more. I'm a movie nerd, i downright loved both of the originals. But then something happened... the remakes came to DVD and i enjoyed them 10 times more at home then at the theater... Anyways, this is a very solid movie. Superb acting by everyone, incredible special effects, even better, sound, dynamic picture... I love it. Ving Rhames is the man as always. Sarah Polley, who annoyed me a few times was strong casting, and everyone else was good too. I don't have to go over the plot, anyone who knows anything about movies knows the plot to dawn of the dead. 2 words... zombies. mall. I have to say though, this is not a social commentary, this is a run-of-the-mill horror flick, but its great. Unlike this movie, and TCN, some remakes suck. The Ring, The Grudge... terrible. It was all boo scares (although the grudge had great atmosphere). All in all I'm very satisfyed, and I'm totally looking forward to the evil dead remake, as well as the amityville horror remake (which was a great idea and has a great lead, the classic Ryan Reynolds.. i mean come on Van Wilder becomes a psycho, u cant go wrong...

"Very fun.  A STRONG ""6"" if not a ""7""","I saw the original movie, and I must say this was a great remake.  I prefer the frantic, ""light on their feet"" zombies as opposed to the sluggish, slow moving ones in the original (thank you ""28 Days Later"").  The old zombies were not that scary; I mean, you could probably skip away from those guys! Or just break into a ""brisk walk"" and you'd leave them in the dust.  Not these new ones though; they full-on sprint right at you!  I dig it. Furthermore, the violence and gore in this movie was very well done.  In a movie like this, that can make or break you.  Also, it's nice to see a movie that has some CGI, but doesn't rely too heavily on it.  Bravo Mr. Snyder! I'm excited about your next project!",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent Remake of a Classic Horror Movie,"Escaping from an epidemic of zombies, the nurse Ana (Sarah Polley), the police officer Kenneth (Ving Rhames), the Best Buy seller Mike (Jake Weber), the small time crook Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his Russian pregnant girlfriend Luda (Inna Korobkina) seek refuge in an isolated mall. There, they find the three security guards leaded by CJ (Michael Kelly), and after an initial problem between the groups, they join forces trying to survive. From their secluded place, they find another survivor, Andy (Bruce Bohne), living on the roof of his gun store. The group organizes an escape plan to a vessel moored in the marina, trying to find a safer nearby island to live. I hate remakes, but I have to admit that this version of 'Dawn of the Dead' is excellent. Indeed, the writer James Gunn used only George Romero's classic storyline in a totally different screenplay. The zombies in this 2004 version do not move slowly like in the original version and there are lots of characters, instead of only four like in the original version. Both 'Dawn of the Dead' are worthwhile horror movies and highly recommended to any fan of this genre. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): 'Madrugada dos Mortos' ('Dawn of the Dead')",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bite Me,"While the most loyal Romero fans might have you believe this remake isn't a patch on the original, this ""re-imagining"" as it should really be defined, is refreshingly good.In fact, this is probably the best example of a remake in some time, and adds a much needed shot of adrenalin into the rather lacking zombie genre.As i said before, this movie is less a remake and more a re-imagining of the original. There's very little in common with Romero's films, and the shopping mall aside, we're offered an entirely new cast of characters, a brand new scenario and a far less claustrophobic feel than the original. This movie tries to steer away from the safe and cautious frame by frame approach, and instead opts to go in it's own individual direction, affectionately referencing it's roots, without lifting too much.As a completely stand alone movie, and not in any way connected with the Savini remake of ""Night of the Living Dead"", this movie throws it's lead (played by Sarah Polley) straight into a zombie over-run world.The set up for the story is brief and speedy enough, but still manages to convey enough about the lead character whilst dropping hints that things are soon to go wrong. The pre-credit sequence is one of the most energetic moments in recent film history, acting as a highlight of the movie, and setting the scene for what's to come.Abandoning the relatively slow and scattered build up of the original, this movie, like it's zombies, builds up at a sprinting pace. The film is often relentless, and with the exception of a few questionable dialogue scenes, it's unlikely anyone might find the film a boring experience.However, the quick and unforgiving nature of the movie also offers up perhaps the biggest drawback. Unlike Romero's original, we barely get time to fully understand or explore the cast of characters. There is some effort to open up the various personalities (especially with the core group) but overall, we're offered two dimensional, hollow caricatures. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and for the general viewing audience, those on screen are entertaining enough in their various roles, but for those who enjoy a little character development, and valued the original movie's slow, ever unfolding pace, it might be hard to find any real handle with which to fully appreciate the characters.However, saying that, the primary players in this movie all fill their roles well enough. Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames and Jake Weber put in sound performances, and the secondary cast play their roles well enough, despite their being one too many clichés for my liking. Then again, it's good to see such a healthy and diverse cast in a horror movie like this.The gore-hounds should love this movie too. There's more than enough blood and cuts on offer, and more times than not, the moments of gore are far beyond what you might expect from a horror movie. Some real attention has been played to making the most of this gross-out moments, and while it might not be to everyone's taste, it should certainly appeal to those whose taste it does accommodate to.To conclude; this movie definitely knows where it's at. It doesn't delude itself to thinking it's high art, and doesn't try to convey any deep and meaningful message or make a comment on the state of society today. Although the Director's Cut of this does include some scenes of this nature (which in my opinion, just don't work) the theatrical release of the film finds just the right balance between the action, horror and drama, with more than a few moments of genuine humor thrown in for good measure.All in all, a strong example of the genre, and an impressive reinvention of the zombie sub-genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A GREATER THAN GREAT REMAKE! Surpasses the original! *NO SPOILERS*,"Words like great, fantastic, spectacular, fabulous, and wonderful are perfect adjectives to describe the Dawn Of The Dead remake. I saw it last night, and loved it so much I plan on seeing it again today. I am a huge fan of the original, I even wore my Dawn Of The Dead shirt made to honor the original to see the remake last night, but I believe that the remake has got it beat by its entertainment and production values. The original will always be a classic, and was the model for pretty much all zombie movies after it to follow, and, until I saw its remake last night, I felt it was the greatest zombie movie ever.

Awesome! But not too faithful to the original.,"This tremendously entertaining picture strikes a great balance between scares, apocalyptic bleakness, and violent action.  The bravura opening sequence of utter chaos leads into a more subdued, but intermittently intensely violent and gruesome narrative.  The movie never sells itself out to sappiness while retaining some of the original's macabre sense of humor, especially in the ""Burt Reynolds"" scene.  The leads are strong, if not deeply developed; things are happening too quickly to delve deeper into these character's backgrounds, but we still care about them, because each of them, down to the gun-shop owner, possesses a humanity and individuality that sets them apart from the brain-thirsty hordes.Elements of the original are retained, from the secure ennui of the mall to the final journey into the unknown, but this is really its own movie, with the intensity ratcheted up to satisfy audiences used to the rapid-fire thrills of a video game.  The editing and camerawork are reminiscent of _Seven_ and _28 Days Later_, but fit the subject matter perfectly.  An exceptional genre picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good remake.,"Zack Snyder. Who is this guy? I've never heard the name before and yet he has managed to make the best remake in recent times. ""Dawn of the dead"" has always been one of my favorite zombie flicks, so naturally it should be impossible to better it, at least by remaking it. I can't really say that the remake is better than the original in any way but it's stands for itself.The tempo, compared to the old movie, is very high. The movie kicks off even before you know it. I somehow feel the movie could have been better if it was a little slower, since you often get to know people for about a second before they turn into zombies. Also the zombies run around like someone has filled their pants with fire-ants, which is a bit sad. I mean zombies are supposed to be slow and stupid.The FX are well made and the atmosphere is reasonably chilling. Whereas the old movie was a clever satire of the consumption and materialistic needs of our society this is more of a full frontal action/horror movie which makes it a lot less original but it's still made in such a good way that it smacks most of the opposition on the fingers.So, while it's not a patch on the original it's a pretty fine movie on it's own and probably the best remake this side of ""The Fly"".

Not As Good As The Original But Entertaining Nonetheless.,"I really enjoyed this remake of George Romero's classic 1978 zombie shocker. After the pointless, basically frame-for-frame colour remake of the original Night of The Living Dead in 1990, I wasn't sure remaking the best of the original trilogy was a great idea but Zack Snyder got it spot on. Instead of creating a scene-for-scene remake like the former remake he just takes the basic premise and updates it for a new generation horror audience complete with brilliant scenes of terror, stylish visuals, loads more humour than the original and last but not least buckets of gore.

"Popcorn movie, but nowhere near the quality of original","First and foremost, this movie is a remake of the '78 classic but it is more of an action film than it is a zombie survival which is what I think made the classic, well, a classic.This movie unravels like a video game campaign cutscene to cutscene rather than a character development movie based on survival as the classic was. It has dark humor, quirky characters, and people doing the dumbest things that put so many lives in danger. It almost even plays out like an action-satire of the classic. This is why its a popcorn movie, it keeps you visually entertained and its a movie you, essentially watch with the boys, especially with the comic relief including the music choices.To compare it with the original as well, this one is almost 30 mins shorter in length, which also goes to show that it cares less about the journey and more about the ride to get there. I would have liked a more serious and more human-experience type movie. But for a Hollywood popcorn movie, it is perfectly fine. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The best action/adventure movie since Aliens.,"I don't have much of positive to say about this movie that hasn't been said here before by other persons, but i truly loved this movie. Unfortunely i haven't seen in in the theaters, but i just saw the new DVD with th directors cut, and i was truly surprised by what he achieved with this pic. It was more like an un-official sequel to 28 Days Later but that was one of the reasons i really enjoyed this movie now. It gave me more of what i wanted to see in 28 Days Later, and it was perfectly successful in creating an atmosphere of pure end of the world in a bigger scale. And it was as much scary as it was thrilling to watch. Very good characters we cared about and excellent action scenes which didn't compromised the atmosphere just to flash off some effects. A very well balanced film with also a fantastic beginning.I loved all the old versions of Romero and much of all the zombie stuff, but this remake now kept me on the edge of my sofa the entire time. I bought the DVD two days ago, (along with Star Wars), and Star Wars is still inside the box, while i've seen Dawn of the Dead twice now. By the way great audio commentary also on the DVD.This movie brought me back the thrills i had when i first saw Aliens. The character of JC even reminded me of Hicks in some way and so in an age where most of the blockbusters who come out of Hollywood are nothing but a bunch of boring junk-food for the eyes, it was great to find an action movie who totally delivered what it promised. Scary and exciting. One of the best adventure movies in a veeeery long time also. 10, out of 10Please make another !",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I love the Dead!,"If you are a Dead fan then this movie is for you.Just about everyone reading this already knows that this is a remake of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead but beyond the title and the fact that the dead have a hankering for munching on the living the similarity (for the most part) ends there. This is an improvement over doing a scene-by-scene remake as was done for the original Night of the Living Dead. I am pleased that the producers decided to add their own interpretation of the genre.Judged on its own merits this is destined to become a classic ""Dead"" movie. The Romero movies are classics, especially the first because nothing like it had ever been done before but the action, direction, make-up, and special effects of this (re-)incarnation make this film a must see. The Romero series is looking rather dated and low budget compared to what can be accomplished with the special effects these days. Do special effects and a bigger budget make a good film? Just refer to the most recent Star Wars films and you'll see that that is not the case.I won't bother with the plot because, let's face it, these movies are about putting ordinary people into extraordinary situations and seeing how they respond. In that context it is easy to understand their appeal. How would you react? Would you just give up and accept your fait, would you fight back or perhaps fight your potential allies for control? This movie covers those aspects similar to how the Romero films covered them, with intelligence and insight into the human character.The bottom line is if you are a fan of the Dead movies than it is worthwhile to see this in the theatre. The production values are good, the action is good, the suspense was a little lacking but overall this is one for my (Dead) dvd collection.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

the trailer was better than the movie !,"The trailer for the movie was good.  Too bad the movie wasn't.  The eerie images had sensational angles, shadows, and lighting accompanied with music that matched went well during the trailer. It's a shame that we didn't see a lot of that in the movie.  It made the movie seem stylish and scary. When the film stops, melts, and the zombies try to come for the audience out of the screen, that was a pretty clever way to end the trailer.  They should have made the movie end that way, too!  Most of the scenes in the trailer were at the beginning of the movie before the opening credits.  In the movie, the director drew the viewer's attention to certain things that ended up to be insignificant.  What was the point?  Could it be to make us think it's going to have an interesting plot with twists?  Well, don't think too hard about anything that goes on because it's pointless.  Were the zombies everywhere?  How far do you have to go to get away from them?  And why did everyone end up at the mall?  Did the mall employees all turn into real zombies?  They should have put in computer generated flies around all the zombies.  Now that would have been clever!  This was supposed to be a horror movie, but it ended up more like a ""HORRORble"" drama with a few thrills thrown in during the first ten minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A little bit too dead,"While it has some new blood pumped into it, some things suffered from unintended anemia. The first 7 minutes gave it a great sense of urgency, it covered the outside world quite well and it seemed to be a hint of things to come. But once they were intrenched at the mall, there never seemed to be a real threat nor a sense of dread. Too many characters suddenly possessed a GI Joe personality rather than a true fear of what was happening around them, so it seemed fine just to hang out at the mall. Even the older woman seemed like she could take on anything so why not just sit tight and slowly pick them off. The zombies rarely were given a role to play so the eeriness and morbidity of the original was erased. The effects were quite beautiful but I didn't feel frightened of the what was out there. If the zombies periodically made their way in, it would have been more unsettling. Beside this remake being the most ""ungory"" of gore films, it all had the feeling of being done before especially with obvious references to earlier horror films like Aliens, Dawn Of The Dead, Body Snatchers and even Rosemary's Baby. Who didn't see that coming? This is from someone who is scared of his own reflection: I never flinched. The trailers and credits were more frightening. A pretty show, with some striking images but kinda flat at the same time, not to mention another 1 note performance by Ving. I will hope for better in the DVD release which will obviously have more ghastly footage. Oh, well.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One Reamake Worth Watching,"I'm not normally a fan of remakes as most people ruin what was good about the original. However, the zombie genre has developed in the last few years, and what was good about the original may not be conceived as good in this day and age. The original obviously being a cult classic zombie flick, possibly the best ever, with a retro look about it that could never be re-created. So the Director had a decision to make, a gamble one might say. Try and Stick to what made the original great or try something new. He tried something new and did a very good job in my opinion.He obviously stuck to the basic story line but i feel there are other aspects to this film that make it good. First off, i felt an original cast was always going to be needed and the actors were excellent. I feel Ving Rhames and Mekhi Phifer, the only well known actors in the film, do really well and all of the other actors played their part superbly.Secondly, i don't know much about this director Zack Snyders work, but I'm going to look into more of his stuff as there was an aesthetic about the movie, a slickness one might say about it that seemed to make the movie flow nicely and the moods within the film be it, comical, horrific, romantic or Sad were shown well and entwined throughout. Be it the moment Ana and Michael fall for each other, Andy The Gunman Dies or when they're running from the zombies screaming and shouting into an elevator only for the screams and hectic camera work to stop and the Calm soothing Elevator Music starts, that i felt was a stroke of genius. It works in a very Dark way and this kind of humour can be seen throughout the film.This film was all about the Direction the Director was going to take it. He took a chance and in my opinion it paid off. A job very well done. Any fan of the traditional zombie flick may not like it as it does steer from the tried and tested formula seen for years, but otherwise i can see most people enjoying this film, especially if you liked 28 Days Later. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Scary, gory and fun","It contains little character development, and ignores the social commentary provided by the original and instead focuses on creating an action flick.

Above-Average Entry in a Crap-Ridden Horror Subgenre,"The first thing that needs to be said about this movie is that it is a completely different animal from the 1978 horror masterpiece by zombie auteur George A. Romero.  The two films share a title and a few superficial details of plot and setting, but other than that, they have little in common.  This movie is not as philosophically deep, intelligent, witty, or suspenseful as Romero's. It's a strictly modern horror flick, and by `modern' I mean that it has typically shallow, flat characters; frequently stupid and vulgar dialogue; and that annoying, MTV-style, this-might-be-scary-if-you-could-tell-what-the-****-was-happening kind of editing. If you go into it with this in mind, you will enjoy it more.And so the next thing that needs to be said is that, despite its self-imposed limitations as an ADD-generation movie, the new `Dawn' still manages to be above-average zombie flesh-eating entertainment -- easily the best entry in this horror subgenre in years (though, considering all the crap out there, that isn't saying a whole lot). So before I get to my list of cons/pet peeves, I'll mention some of the positive aspects of this movie.First, the changes to the story go beyond the standard, gratuitous, change-for-the-sake-of-change sort. There are some truly inventive elements here, such as the impressive scenes of devastation at the beginning of the film, the lone survivor on the rooftop across from our heroes and their relationship with him, and the well done `Blair Witch' style coda during the end credits. Overall, the whole `zombie epidemic' is handled pretty slickly and without any of that snarky, postmodern self-consciousness that sinks so many remakes of well-known classics.Next, although the zombie splatter action is not as over-the-top graphic as it is in Romero's classics, director Zack Snyder avoids the cop-out cutaway shot often enough to satisfy at least the casual gorehound. (Actually, some scenes serve to remind just how wimpy your average splatter horror movie has become these days.)And while it's true that the powerful subtext of Romero's work and his sardonic wit are absent in the new `Dawn,' there are still some moments of black comedy that really are pretty funny. (Watch for the `celebrity' shoot-'em-up sequence for a prime example.)Finally, the music selections are inspired, from Johnny Cash in the opening credits to Richard Cheese during the midpoint comic relief to `People Who Died' by the Jim Carroll Band during the closing credits (I didn't think more than a handful of people even knew that song existed). Throw in some well placed muzak selections, and it becomes clear that someone with a brain deliberately worked on the soundtrack. Awesome!Now for the bad things. Perhaps most prominently, the movie suffers from the `modern' attributes mentioned above. The characters are not given a chance to truly develop; you never really know any of them and, hence, don't particularly care about them. To be fair, I think screenwriter James Gunn did make an effort to infuse some life into our intrepid heroes, but there are just too many characters (read: zombie fodder) for even the most skilled writer to develop. As a result, what characterization there is almost seems like an afterthought, and some of the actions of the characters are just inexplicable. (I suspect the DVD, when it comes out, may offer a number of deleted scenes that help, ahem, flesh things out more.)Nobody watches zombie movies for the dialogue, but I wish Hollywood screenwriters didn't feel the need to gratuitously throw the `f-word' and other assorted obscenities into every other sentence. I'm not prudishly averse to cussing, but a forced excess of expletives just detracts from the import of what's actually said and reminds viewers of the inherently juvenile nature of Hollywood moviemaking these days.As for the MTV-video style editing, do I really need to explain how much better it would be if the director let your eye focus on the action for more than a tenth of a second?Overall, the new `Dawn' owes more to `28 Days Later' than its namesake, at least as far as the zombie mythology goes. Like Romero's films, the cause of the zombie plague is unknown, and also like in Romero's films, it doesn't matter. Unlike Romero's films, however, the clues point more to a virus, as in Danny Boyle's pseudo-zombie epic. Here the zombies are definitely dead, but they also movie rapidly, again as in `28 Days Later.' And although I prefer the creeping sense of dread of Romero's slow-moving animated corpses, I found the fast zombies didn't bother me as much as I thought they would. What really bothered me was the stupid wildcat noises they made when they attacked. Why would walking (ok, running) corpses make noises like that? Dumb.However, in the movie's favor, the zombies here sometimes make more sense than Romero's.  In particular, there's one scene where a zombie is chasing down someone to eat, but then abruptly breaks off pursuit as soon as he spots an easier mark. Romero's zombies like to kill people, begin eating them, then stop as soon as they see someone else to kill, leaving you to wonder why they would bother chasing someone else when they already have something to eat.Oh well. In the end, as Chief McLellan from `Night of the Living Dead' puts it, `They're dead. They're all messed up.'Not a masterpiece, but still recommended for fans of the living dead.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dawn of a new Horrror movie,"As a film buff, I love movies. As a horror movie buff, I love horror movies. However, I have been saddened by the lack of decent horror flicks. Most of them have been mediocre at best. But now, here comes the dawn of a horror movie that is, dare i say it, AMAZING!!!!! The casting of mostly unknown stars was ideal for this movie and served the plot better than if Uma Thurman or Nicole Kidman played the leading lady. Instead, this is an ensemble driven movie, which it should feel like if survivors are uniting together against the undead. I actually felt compassion towards each and every character. The script was impeccable and the direction even better. The acting of all the unknown stars was fabulous and I LOVED the roles of Ana and that cynical guy with the boat ( I forgot his name). All of the situations felt so fresh and it never felt like I was watching a remake. The cinematography blew me away and some of the most intimate shots used with zombies actually added another dynamic to the static and boring character of a zombie. My only real gripe was that the whole Grandma showdown thing felt a little too ""wild west"" for me and that after the opening sequence and titles, the whole movie started off very slowly, which was strange considering there was a whole outbreak of zombies. other than that, i thought that this movie was awesome.

"A decent remake, but could have remained more faithful to the original.","This is a decent remake, but it could have remained more faithful to the original. The attackers in this movie behave more like people infected with rabies than zombies. When the undead spot their potential victims, they charge at them at full speed. And, not every victim rises from the dead, but only those that are bitten. Sound familiar? In previous ""Living Dead"" movies and knockoffs, attacking zombies stumble around like, well, zombies. And everyone who dies comes back, not just those who are bitten. This is an obvious rip-off of ""28 Days Later.""

Worthwhile to see,"It had a really good start. Very terrifying. The tense was nevertheless palpable all throughout the movie. Characters were also very fine, no overplaying. There wasn't much text, but I didn't miss it - all the explanations. The drama, that was between the characters, was enough and well-played, unlike most American movies in my opinion. There was also not much time to pause and think very long during the movie, about what is going to happen to all these people on the roof. Everything went on smoothly and quickly, although in between I somehow seemed to miss some of the development, for example when did they decide to escape through the underground garage in the mall.The attempt failed, regarding some addition to the dead army. In conclusion I wish I hadn't seen the ending subtitles of the movie:) , then I wouldn't of known, what was going to happen to them on that island. I would have gone to bed, knowing the survivors lived through the tragedy, that fell upon human kind (""when hell is full, dead walk the ground""), although that would have made Dawn of the Dead just another usual ""happy-ending story"". Then again, I stress, this is definitely not some usual ""bad-ending story"" too! Every movie has to have an ending of some kind. I liked the music. It's hardly likely they survived on that island.

Excellent Movie But Not Dawn Of The Dead,"The movie was great,definitely one of the better films in the genre recently.Unfortantly I don't think it should have been called dawn of the dead.First of all the ""zombies""had more in common with the infected from 28 days later,in both transmission And mobility,than any resurrected dead traditional or otherwise.I don't see how they can run full speed considering they are reanimated flesh,and dead tissue goes through rigor mortise.As for similarities to the original, it has a mall and a few lines of dialog lifted from the original.but with those gripes out of the way,I must say the movie was great.The story was tight ,if not to deep.The inclusion of a zombie baby birth was something i've wanted to see in a movie ever since reading Brian Keene's novel The Rising.I also thought the character dynamics as they were stripped down to their essence in the struggle for survival to be very interesting.All in all though,I personally think this movie is best viewed by forgetting its a remake of Romero's film,and take it in as it's own creature.Under those circumstances the film is in my opinion a very welcome addition to the undead canon.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great film,"Has to the best horror with action film I've seen , the style , gore and pure tension is just superb.

I thought the fact that the zombies could move quickly was a good idea after all why not , its not like they are going to get tired of running like we do is it !

Uninspiered.,"Am I really the first negative review for this movie on here? That's pathetic.It was just stale.The beginning brought my level of hope for this movie up pretty high, and the sleek new zombies were pretty amazing. When the zombie action and scare scenes actually happened, there were simply some of the best I've seen on film.Too bad action and scares only happened for 20% of the movie, and even that might be a little high. The majority of this film was just stale, boring dialog with some comedy thrown in. I thought the comedy bits were pretty well-done, but they didn't fit. At all. I think the scariest part of this entire movie is the main menu.I just can't give this movie a positive rating because I've seen this movie done before a hundred timesbut done right. Parts of the movie reminded me of Cloverfeild, which kept the mood and setting without the pointless dialog. Parts reminded me of the video game Dead Rising, which had complete and total zombie mayhem and massacre, whereas this movie didn't come close.I'm not even sure this was worth watching once because it is so dull.0/10",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Original vs. Remake,"I think the remake improved on some things, but fell short in others.In the remake they had no where else to go but the mall. As opposed to the original where they stay there even though they have a fully functional helicopter. There were a lot of times they should have just hopped in the copter and got out of there.A lot of purists like the sluggish, mentally retarded zombies over the high speed zombies of the remake. But I thought the newer zombies were a lot scarier. You can't just run by them and give them a good right cross to the jaw. Or throw a pie in their face!The original was better in character development, and really driving home the isolation of this new world.And of course in the original they showed the horror of being eaten alive.The biggest advantage the original has over the remake is the creatures were real zombies. The real undead. Enough of this stupid virus stuff!",,Anonymous,Horror
Actually not a bad reboot!,"This movie is a typical movie from the 2000's and follows the format that most reboots use. If I had to compare this to the older versions I would simply say that this has more action and more interpersonal drama. This is definitely not better than the original, but to be honest each movie is completely different. Yes they are the same story, but done in two completely different ways. You really just have to decide what type of movie you are in the mood for... do you want to watch a more suspenseful slow burn? Watch the original one. Do you want more fast-paced action? and character emotion? Watch the reboot.A couple things worth complimenting -- The practical effects and makeup blend well with the CGI, There is a scene where a truck runs over some zombies and I had to rewind and watch a second time because it was done so well. The blood effects are great. The common movie-goer won't know the difference. I mean, there are practical/CGI blended effects in this movie that are far superior to Watchmen, and that movie cost 5 times as much to make. Hell, look at the CGI used in The Dark Knight to show Harvey Dent's Two-Face... even that CGI looked fake, and we all know how much that movie cost. Of course there are even better effects used in much loser budget movies in the Dead series, but this movie has its value.Also -- the cast. A perfect assortment of B-movie actors....

A worthy re-make for once...,"Normally I am not particularly keen on re-makes of movies, especially when directors decide to tamper with movies that were already good in the original version. But this being a zombie movie, is almost sufficient in itself to make me look past my contempt for re-makes. But as a re-make of the 1978 original Romero movie ""Dawn of the Dead"", I must admit that director Zack Snyder really impressed.While there are in overall similarities to the 1978 movie, then director Zack Snyder deviated enough from the original movie to make this 2004 version outstanding and memorable. And he managed to do so without actually embarrassing the George A. Romero legacy. And while there are similarities, then there is even more originality, which makes the 2004 version seem like a very different movie compared to the original.The story, briefly summarized, is about a group of people cramped together inside a shopping mall with hordes of relentless zombies gathering outside. But with chances of survival dwindling, tempers flare, and things taking unseen twists, the survivors struggle not just against the zombies, but also against themselves.The effects in Zack Snyder's version were impressive, with lots of great visuals in terms of zombie make-up, wounds and injuries and the special effects throughout the movie. And such effects are crucial when making a zombie movie, and I will say that the special effects and make-up departments really came through in this 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"".But a lot of credit should also go to the acting talents, as they had some talented people on the cast list. Sarah Polley was really great in her role, and I haven't really taken much notice of her prior to this movie. Ty Burrell, Ving Rhames and Jake Weber were also quite good in their individual roles. Personally, I found it a delight to see Matt Frewer in the movie as well.""Dawn of the Dead"" is a fast paced movie with lots of entertainment and thrills. Director Zack Snyder managed to present his vision in a way that was captivating and compelling for the audience, and it is difficult not to get swept up into the atmosphere of the movie.This 2004 version is well-worthy of a place in the movie collection of any zombie aficionado, and it is likewise well-worthy of a place alongside with Romero's 1978 version.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"More action than horror, but gets a lot more right than it does wrong","The good: It's a solid, fast paced zombie action-horror film. There's enough blood and gore to keep enthusiasts of the genre pleased and there's minimal cheese to starve off the eye rolls. The narrative structure itself also feels nicely bookended, with a simple plot that is easy to follow. There's no story surprises in this film, it's exactly what you'd expect. And that's a good thing.The Bad: The characters are all pretty flat and the acting ranges from mediocre to good (ving rhames being a stand-out). Sorry Ty Burrell (Modern Family), you just aren't meant to play the 'bad-boy'. You're too nice! Also, Zack Synder tries to go for the feels in some scenes, it's a nice try but it doesn't grab hold. There's so much death and carnage that you don't have a vested interest in anyone as the movie conditions you expect a shelf-life for every character.Should you watch it? If you like zombie movies.

Well, I did not get it at all, except for like the first 15 minutes or so, when I was in stiches.  The remaining hour and a half or so, I was just waiting for it to end.There is a period of about an hour in the film where absolutely nothing happens.  A group of survivors hole up in a shopping mall to keep safe, and uhhh well that's your movie folks.  Nothing happens from that point on, until the end.  This movie is nowhere near as consistent or as exciting as last years '28 Days Later.""  I also accept that these movies are not supposed to be realistic at all, I reinforce they are my FAVORITE films, but I somewhat expect them to be consistent.  You have some charaters who get bit, and turn into zombies within minutes, and others who take hours or days to turn.  Completely inconsistent, and it got a bit annoying.

This movie was so good I forgot I was videoing it,"This is the first time I've been back to the cinema in Aylesbury since my date with that girl from the Internet (see my Silence of the Lambs' review) but everyone was really cool about it. Richie showed them his ID and told them it was part of my rehabilitation, and the manager let us in.We went to see Dawn of the Dead' which had sequel written all over it in my opinion. I was cool about seeing it though, but told Richie that I'd seen the first one and remembered that it was rubbish (see my Dead Poets Society' review). Richie said he didn't really want to watch it either, but knew a few people who did.Because the seat numbers kept changing I couldn't work out where we had to sit, so Richie sat me down at the front and made a few phone calls whilst I watched the adverts. When they were finished Richie gave me a video camera and told me to focus on the screen, press record and then not move. Richie then tells me he's got to go because there's a mammoth lose in the hospital and to wait here for him, because it's a test.The film was really crazy and scary though, so I had to concentrate hard on not moving. It's about the dead coming back to life and attacking people and in many ways reminded me of Last of the Summer Wine'. But these undead people have a taste for human flesh and so these people have to hide in a shopping centre to escape.I kept thinking that a better place to hide would be at the hospital were Richie works. That's where babies come from and babies are life, so that would scare the dead away. Also the mammoth could trample any undead that got inside.All the people in the film were really nice and friendly and when some of them died it made me feel sad, but the film's colours made me feel happy and kind of drunk. Towards the end some of the ushers came to talk to me but because of the test I couldn't reply, so I pretended not to see them. They got quite angry, but luckily Richie turned up and told them about capturing my fears' and anger transference' so they left us alone.The good news is that I must be making progress because on the way out Richie told me that the ushers are even dumber than you'. That's progress.Movie Rating: B+Rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language and sexuality.",,Anonymous,Horror
Fast & Furious,"If you can get your head around the fact, that this is called ""Dawn of the Dead"" but is more an action movie, rather than a horror movie. Hence do not compare this with the original (Romero) Dawn! It works pretty good as an action movie. Zombies that can run, may or may not be your thing (I'm still with the slow ones). Social criticism has gone (almost completely) AWOL, but it is still nice to see at least one familiar face (Ken Foree that is).I really dug this movie although I am really big fan of the Original. But as I have said before, you can't compare the movies. And even though I haven't seen the Day of the Dead remake (haven't heard nothing good about it at all), I'm pretty sure this is one of the better remakes of Romero movie (even or because it does not try to imitate it).",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"I would've recommended this back in 04' and it should definitely go down as a ""Cult"" Classic","I remember seeing this in the theater, back in 2004. I will never forget how unexpectedly horrific, excited and awesome the opening 15 minute scene of Dawn of the Dead actually was... and I was 24 at the time. Also take into account 2004, was well before the entire ""Zombie Apocalyptic"" genre pandemic swept across everymovie complex and network station.

"Some good twists, but overall a disappointment as a remake","If you can forget this is a remake, it's not bad for an ""escape"" movie. It's got enough gore and action to keep you entertained, but for a moderate stretch in the middle where not much happens.  The opening sequence is absolutely terrifying, and pulled me right in with it's chaotic apocalyptic nightmare.  Once the characters get to the ""mall,"" however, things slow down to a pace that makes me a little bored.The audience is never made to feel like the zombies outside are a real threat to the living in the mall.  The atmosphere is not bleak-- rather, you can almost forget about what's happening outside as the characters have fun inside the mall.  There's even comic relief (there were no comic moments in the original; it was completely dark).  I suppose this part of the movie was supposed to be about character development, but the movie even fails at that.  Most of the character development is shallow, stereotypical, and it is difficult to understand the motivations behind some of the characters' actions.While it may seem like I hated the movie, the last thirty minutes or more are edge-of-your-seat thrilling, so the payoff is good.  As far as comparing this movie with the original, I would definitely call this movie a disappointment.  It's too flashy!  There is slick heavy metal music, blatant product placement, comedy, and cheap attempts to make you feel emotional without anything deep or philosophical under it.  The original made you feel as if something terrible had happened to humanity.  This film only makes you feel as if something terrible has happened to the characters in the film, most of which you could care less about.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The most entertaining Horror movies of all time,"Dawn of the Dead is a masterpiece of a horror films. I have seen many horror movies including Evil Dead, Hellraiser, Freddy movies, Jason Movies, Exorcist, Haloween and Texas Chain saw massacre. The List will go on, never have i been this entertained. Apart from Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead is one of the most entertaining Horror movies ever made. Packed with lots and lots of gore, blood and violence, This is one roller-coaster ride of Fun. The 70s version was a Classic, but this version is Much better. The 70s dead walked very slowly, one step at a time. It will be easy for the survivors to escape. This version the dead run fast and attack their victim, making it tough for the survivors. Ving Rhames gives a good performance. I saw this movie first day at 11pm.

It's a good movie for the most part,"A lot of the nine and ten star reviews are from around the time this movie was released. I don't think this movie deserves that much hype, although it certainly is a solid film. It's a AAA action horror movie: the whole thing is beautifully shot, and no expense was spared with location and special effects. That being said, some of the movie is kind of ridiculous and not in a good way. Some of the characters are just throwaway set pieces and it suffers from the general maximalism trend of the mid 2000s.
However, this is not a bad film by any means. There's a lot of action, and it doesn't overstay its welcome with the 100 minute runtime. Some of the performances are believable and touching. It's not a ""meh"" movie either, it's definitely a contender for one of the best zombie films of all time.

A good zombie movie ***,"I've always been known to trash needless ""remakes"" of films, and especially the more recent re-do's. I think it's become a celluloid disease that's really infested cinema these days and there aren't a whole lot of fresh ideas remaining, specifically in the Horror genre. Having gotten this out of the way, there are exceptions to every rule and all you die-hard Romero fans might as well get your stones ready for hurling at me right now, because I may actually like the 2004 version more than the 1978 film.In all honesty, other than spending some of its time in a shopping mall there really isn't all that much direct similarity between this new DAWN and the original; hell, this movie could have been called something else entirely (NIGHT OF THE ZOMBIES, 28 DAYS LATER or anything) and then it wouldn't have mattered to hardcore purists as much, because this film is very much its own animal. We all know that the real business reasoning behind using the title DAWN OF THE DEAD was to lure in the hardcore fan base. So it's best to approach this experience as just another ""end of the world""/""zombie takeover"" situation on its own terms.Still, comparisons (thanks to the title) are bound to crop up. I found these ghouls to be a refreshing change from the traditional slow-moving ones; I'd be much more terrified at having a carnivorous flesh-eating cannibal hot on my ass running after me than I would one of those old fashioned crawlers who could easily get knocked to the ground by a good sneeze from my nostrils. This doesn't mean I don't retain my fondness for the more limping, arthritic type of zombie of yesteryear; it just means I thought this change was welcome and posed a greater threat. Since whatever is ailing these creatures is never explained, I also had no problems believing it could make them speedy and even roar like wildcats. Hey, at least it makes them fearsome.It's been claimed that the characters in this new version are not sympathetic nor well developed, and I take serious issue with that... On the contrary -- it's the characters of the ""original"" DAWN OF THE DEAD whom I've never felt anything for. But in the 2004 film - and this is especially true regarding the favored Director's Cut - these people are exceptionally well defined and distinct from each other. There are heroes (Ving Rhames) and there are villains in this predicament (the security creep). Sweet guys and jerky guys (the dope with the boat is a perfect example of the latter). Guys you can feel sorry for (like Andy on the roof or that poor soul who has to face a crucial decision late in the fight). And no matter which version you prefer, Sarah Polley runs circles around Gaylen Ross in the Leading Lady Department.Zack Snyder is no genius (after all, he still allowed inappropriate hard rock music into the soundtrack for one thing), but he's directed a pretty good thriller with an end-of-the-world feel. This is especially felt in the knockout pre-credits sequence. There are plenty of exploding heads and gore to please fans of the original yet not go into overkill mode as happened the first time. It's not perfect and it's not as horrifying as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, nor is it as uncomfortably apocalyptic as DAY OF THE DEAD ... but for all intents and purposes that are forever open for debate, it IS more fun for me than that other Romero zombie film that fits between those two.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"An action movie, not a horror movie","Okay as remakes go, but in an entirely different vein to the original (of which I am a great fan). As I say, this is an action movie with horror elements and the original was a pure horror movie. And plenty of action there is for fans of such movies, and there's nothing wrong with that. But personally I prefer the original. In a choice between horror and action I go for horror.Another reason why I prefer the original - too many characters. In the original there were just the four survivors holed up in a shopping mall. So there was a chance to identify with each character. With the remake there are just too many for this.I love the first ten minutes though. How the crisis goes from a few casualties in the hospital to a full blown crisis overnight, with the central character Anna missing the whole thing. Only to be thrown in at the proverbial deep end the next morning. The best few minutes of the movie in my view. After this it gradually turns into what I have said already - an action movie with horror.Overall one for action movie fans but not so much for horror fans.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not terrible but terribly disappointing.,"The opening of this, the pre-title sequence, is breathtaking. The couple and their child in the suburban house, the fast moving terror and gore and out on the street the full and terrifying picture becoming apparent is awe inspiring and I felt like rising up and applauding. And then we proceed to the mall and although it is interesting at first to notice the difference between the 70s and 00s malls, between Romero's setting and this, it is sadly all downhill from here. We miss the joy of looting, we miss the bonding of characters, we miss the knowledge in the back of our minds that there is a helicopter way out and we miss the bikers and just about everything that is good about the Romero and Argento originals. We are way ahead in this one, we groan as soon as we see the pregnant woman, we can't wait for the repercussions to be out the way and we begin to long for those zombies to get in and chomp them up. Having the dead move so quickly must have seemed a brave and innovative move but it ruins everything and although could presumably have been made to work in a different environment, not in a closed one like this, that relied on that spooky, jerky, slow but persistent and relentless forward thrust. Not terrible but terribly disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not bad, but not nearly as good as the original","The original DOTD is one of my Top 3 favorite horror films of alltime so I was bound to be disappointed in the remake but it was actually a little better than I expected. If you're looking for a slick, glossy and gory zombie film you'll be pleased. Actually, younger audiences and people who haven't seen the original DOTD might like the film more. The intro (first 10 minutes or so) and end credits sequences are both brilliant and make the film worth watching all by itself.I guess my big criticism is that the DOTD remake should've been a stand-alone film because it has almost NOTHING to do with the original, other than zombies the mall setting. Except the zombies in the first film were slow, lumbering and relentless. The zombies in this film are fast, rabid, and quite derivative of 20 Days Later. The mall setting in the first film was used to satirize consumer culture. The mall in this version of DOTD is just a setting - the characters in this film could have holed up anywhere, because the remake complete eliminates all of the subtext of the first film.Some good gore, a few scares and the most inspired intro and end credits I've seen in a horror film in a while, but whereas the original DOTD was funny and smart in addition to being horrifying, this version is slick, shallow and has nothing to say.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
My Take,"I thought the movie was excellent! I didn't really care for the 1978 original. Sorry! This 2004 remake was full of action, surprises, and a bit of humor here and there. The only part that I found to be really stupid was where Sarah Polley's character, Anna, SAW what happened to her husband, but said absolutely nothing to the rest of the gang about it until the next day or two. How dumb? It wasn't difficult to figure out. She saw the condition of ""Vivian"" the little girl who lived on her street, and she saw what Vivian did to her husband, Louis. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that he died and then ""came back"" due to the bite from the little girl. I just didn't like the way they had Anna so closed-mouth and clueless about how the ""sickness"" spreads until darn near the end. Also, it would have been a nice touch for them to go a little in depth about HOW the ""Zombie-Virus"" started. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie and I've watched it at least a million times!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well...,"Seeing the glorious reviews, I expected nothing but a good zombie fun. What I got was... Well... Let's just say the first half of the movie is bad... Characters aren't acting realistic, nor according to the situation and the movie is trying too much to be serious by exploring some themes and there are sexual scenes sprinkled all through the movie... It just feels wrong... No nihilistic feeling of dread and depression like the first Romero's trilogy. Oh, and the zombies aren't slow, they run. Then the second part of the movie starts, and things finally get together... What you get in second part is practically ""Left 4 Dead"" in a movie, which is no surprise, because the movie probably served as an inspiration for the game. And while it lasts, it's awesome... Aaaand, then they ruin it with the credits scene. I can understand why people like it, and on it's own, it's OK movie, but compared to the original, it's bad.

A daily comment from Midget Emma: Dawn of the Dead (2004),"One of the best zombie movies ever!!!!!Dawn of the dead was of the best zombie movie ever. There was a couple of unexpected faces in there. I didn't expect Jake Weber (who i know from Medium)to be in this movie. The violence was out of control which is what you would expect from a zombie movie.There are a few funny moments and a lot of zombie attacking, bullet through the head, blood going everywhere moments in in. The running zombies are much better then the slow groaning zombies because it makes the movie much better because it makes it harder for the survivors to get away which makes the movie more heart pounding.This is a great guy movie. There may be a hand full of girls out there who will like this movie(like me)and be able to stand the gore and blood.The story begins with Ana, a nurse who notices many weird things happening inside and outside of the hospital. When the zombies hit her house she flees and finds other survivors who take cover in the mall. I thought the dog was great(when you see the movie you will know what i am talking about)it was so cute and was a little bit of a hero.I recommend this movie to every soul on the planet. If you can't stand blood and gore then don't see this movie. It is the best zombie movie along with Shawn of the dead.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

This is how remakes SHOULD be made!,"One of the few remakes of recent years that is actually worth watching, Zack Snyder's Dawn Of The Dead takes the basic plot from George Romero's 1978 original, in which survivors of a zombie outbreak barricade themselves in an abandoned mall, and strips away the social commentary whilst cranking up the action, delivering a white-knuckle ride of flesh-eating terror.A nerve-shredding pre-titles sequence see Ana (Sarah Polly), a pretty nurse, narrowly escaping with her life after her neighbourhood is rapidly over-run by the living dead: nasty, snarling, nightmarish creatures that, unlike in Romero's movie, can run like the clappers. All around her, chaos is erupting as the zombies rapidly increase in numbers, and Sarah eventually loses control of her car and crashes into a tree. Cut to black. Cue titles...I haven't seen such a great opening to a film since Raiders of the Lost Ark!And what follows is just as intense. The remainder of the film sees Sarah team up with a tough cop (Ving Rhames), a TV salesman (Jake Weber), and a young couple expecting their first child (Mekhi Phifer and Inna Korobkina), who are travelling to the relative safety of a nearby mall. But once in the sprawling shopping centre, the group realises that zombies are not the only threat to their safety: the white trash security guards that patrol the building are not too keen on sharing their sanctuary with outsiders.Very gory, and damn scary (a scene in a pitch black underground car-park being my favourite creepy moment), with characters that are developed enough for us to care about, Dawn Of The Dead is a triumph. Its narrative contains enough differences from the original to make it constantly surprising, the special effects are top notch, with truly unsettling zombies and some disgustingly realistic gore, and the cast are utterly convincing as the terrified survivors of a nightmarish apocalypse.I first saw this film at a late-night screening in my local multiplex. Afterwards, nerves extremely jangled, I had to walk through a nearby shopping centre in order to get to my car, which was parked in a large and quite poorly lit car-park.I'm not ashamed to say that I've never moved so fast in my life!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
good flick; but left gaping questions,"I like it despite the nitpicking I'm about to embark on. It's a zombie flick. Do I need to elaborate anymore than that? My issues are that the people in the mall weren't in there long enough for the the condition of many of the corpses around the building and in the parking garage. Then there's the generators for the mall that can't work as long with the load those people seemed to be using. Also, why did Luda take forever to die when everyone else died within hours? What happened to Andy's attacker(s).They didn't leave the gun shop, yet they weren't present in the shop either. Just some nitpicking gaps that made it a bit hard to swallow as zombie movies go. We won't even go anywhere near the fact that they don't even attempt to provide even the slightest clue of what caused this tragedy in any way, shape, or form. While I gave this movie a 7 rating, for your money, rent ""28 days later"". While it has just as many holes in it's credibility as does Dawn of the Dead, it holds it a bit more in check.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the great zombie movies - - - if you're not too picky,"A random group of Navy SEALS sharpshooters, Israeli SWAT team members and Wild West gunslingers find themselves trapped in a Milwaukee shopping mall. . . . Okay, they're really supposed to be an ordinary group of strangers. I merely wish to point out that of the roughly 47 gazillion shots fired in the course of this film, not a one of them misses. To kill a zombie, of course, you have to shoot it in the head---not an easy shot even if both shooter and target are stationary. But we get a feeble old man shooting two handguns while being dragged backward; a guy who didn't know where his safety catch was, dispatching dozens of zombies - - - BANG!--Another zombie down. You get the idea.This isn't criticism; I'm giving this film 8 out of 10. But you should know, if watching it for the first time, that you'll be asked not only to suspend disbelief, but to hang disbelief by the neck until dead. Plot holes are too numerous to mention; logic (even the film's internal logic) is gently slid off to the side and into oblivion; numerous major questions are never answered, notably how the sudden zombie virus originated, apparently overnight. Oh, lots of stuff.How, then, an 8 out of 10? Because ""Dawn of the Dead,"" unlike any other zombie film I've seen (full disclosure here: I have NOT seen the 1978 original), clearly had someone with a brain behind it. Maybe even two such someones! There's good, chiseled dialogue; consistent understatement (an early, excellent example is the TV news flash while Ana and her hubby are otherwise engaged; we're not told what the news flash is about---just that there is one); and even some character development! (Well, not the zombies; they pretty much just keep on doing what zombies do.) Also, as other IMDb reviewers have pointed out, very effective flashes of humour, the best being the scene in which the lead characters, communicating by sign with a gun-shop owner stranded atop his store across the street, suggest targets---""Burt Reynolds""--- and the gun guy takes aim and blows away the shambling zombie who resembles Burt Reynolds.My only serious complaint with this immensely entertaining film is the portrayal of the zombies. You'd think that someone would find some workable variant on the universal zombie standard: arms outstretched, bloody mouth, eyes circled in kohl for that sunken look. It's a tried and true formula, but watch enough zombie films and you just get tired.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

One of my favourite zombie films!,"'Dawn of the Dead' is a remake of George A. Romero's 1978 'Dawn of the Dead'. With Zack Snyder's touch, it became the highest grossing zombie film of all time at the time of release, and the first zombie film ever to gross $100 million.The film is most memorable for the handful of survivors being trapped inside a shopping mall, with hordes of zombies around them. The film revolves around these victims' survival instinct amidst conflict among them. The performances are very good. The make-up is incredible. And the jump scares aplenty. 'Dawn of the Dead' is scary right from the beginning, and continues its trend throughout, until the final moment.By now we all now how zombie films work. When you're bitten by a zombie, you become one. I enjoyed the characters being ignorant to this fact. They had no idea what caused people to turn, and having infected survivors among them significantly elevated the suspense. The pregnant woman being bitten shortly before giving birth also added to the suspense.I enjoyed the characters - even the 'bad' ones. Ana (Sarah Polley) and Michael (Jake Weber) were the strongest characters, and the film's main protagonists. Michael Kelly was the (human) antagonist, CJ, but even he turned out a likable character towards the end.'Dawn of the Dead' is a well made film with a great survival element. This is a top-notch production in every aspect, with an exciting final act. This is by far one of my favourite zombie films.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"I'm super squeamish and hate scary movies, but I'd recommend this flick.","My husband rented this and I was, annoyed- to say the least.He'd seen it before and I loathe slasher movies. I hide behind my hands during violent scenes in regular movies. (Although I must brag that I waited for hours to see ""The Blair Witch Project."") How could I be expected to watch a high budget zombie movie?The first 20 minutes were difficult. I kept asking if I should hide my eyes. The music and weird vibe of the opening scenes made me uncomfortable. I kept wondering how they were going to introduce the inevitable. I was edgy and creeped out by the, well- by the ""dawn of the dead."" I couldn't tell if Anna was the main character or one of those people they kill off at the beginning just to mess with you, like Drew Barrymore in ""Scream.""After the main characters were all introduced, my grip on the hide-my-face-pillow was loosened. I was thankful for the comic relief and the minimal gore within the confines of the shopping mall sanctuary. The special effects/make up were more than expected. Usually everyone looks like they're covered in beefaroni, but (as the special features on the DVD point out)these dead guys were modeled from forensic photographs. Sometimes the zombies are amusing, like the bloated woman who's so fat she's dragged in by wheelbarrow or the bumbling Burt Reynolds look alike killed off in a twisted version of Hollywood Squares. Other times the images are haunting, like the first zombie, a small girl with her lips ripped off or the woman accidentally killed in the get-away bus.""Dawn of the Dead"" was believable as what would happen if, dare I say it...zombies took over the earth. But what's with this?: The mall refugees' rooftop friend across the street is starving so they send a dog over with food. As expected, this plan goes awry. For crying out loud! They live in a mall. Why not go to the toy store and get an r.c. airplane and send IT over with a sandwich? ""Duh"" moments aside, my only complaint is the ending.The constant flipping between camcorder and credits was nauseating. All in all, I'd suggest this to a guy friend.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
An incredibly average zombie film with the same name as a classic,"It is impossible to evaluate the success of this movie without comparing it to the original. The fantasy element of living in the mall which drove the classic film, of having all the creature comforts of civilization amid the apocalypse, is missing entirely. The social commentary of the original, that consumerism has become so instinctive that even zombies would gravitate towards the mall, is missing entirely. This isn't ""Dawn of the Dead""; this is just a movie that has a mall in it.Also absent are any compelling characters. While the original focused on no more than four survivors, the number is more than tripled in the remake to diminished effect. There are no nuanced portrayals here; the cast never transcends flat character descriptions like ""the tough nurse"", ""the pregnant woman"", or ""the jerk security guard"". As we see them dispatched with the indifference we might reserve for reality show contestants, none of these characters make much of an impression. Original film actor Ken Foret has a brief cameo as a fundamentalist preacher, and in his less than two minutes of screen time he provides a more powerful performance than any of the main cast.The fast zombies are more comedic than scary. Whether they're sprinting after cars like cartoon dogs, bashing their heads through doors, or squealing like pigs as they are picked off by gunfire, the undead never seem to present a credible threat.For all its enhanced budget and updated special effects, this ""Dawn of the Dead"" does not offer anything that cannot be found in the previous four decades of zombie horror. Once again we have to sit through the usual bickering between survivors over who will lead, the standard ""bit by a zombie and waiting to turn"" play for our sympathies, the predictable ill- advised trip to the basement. All this and more has been done before, and executed more effectively.Zack Snyder has always been an amazing visualist, and this is one way in which the film redeems itself. The full scope of a neighborhood descending into chaos is revealed through a camera mounted on an escaping vehicle. Two characters saying a tearful goodbye is broken into multiple cuts from several perspectives, distorting time and drawing us into the moment. The daylight scenes appear overexposed, amplifying the idea that this catastrophe is happening in our real world.

"Dawn of the dead who died while reading ""I am legend"" during the night of the living dead","Written by James Gunn and directed by Zack Snyder ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 2004 is a remake of the original George A. Romero's film ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 1978, which is a sequel to his 1968 ""Night of the Living Dead"" inspired by the 1954 novel ""I am Legend"" by Richard Matheson.""Dawn of the Dead"" is a classic of a zombie apocalypse genre. The plot tells us about a group of people who teamed up in a shopping mall during the zombie apocalypse. Nowadays, it seems to be a cliched (and it is), but for early 20s, when all this zombie stuff was only developing, I think the idea was quite innovative. Moreover, there were some moments included, which I strongly don't support, but in James Gunn's or Zack Snyder's opinion, they had a place to be in the film.The acting was good. Honestly, I haven't seen any of them in other projects except this one, but I think they did a great job and successfully fit the setting. During the film I wanted to empathize some characters, and some of them were just idiots.Also, I really liked the zombies! In most of the films zombies are shown as slow and clumsy, which makes them less dangerous, but here they are fast and aggressive making the fight scenes more intensive and interesting to watch. One more I want to note is how great was the work that makeup artists did. Zombies looked scary, but without busting and it was very professional.My first meeting with this film happened when I was a child, and, honestly, it was quite a shocking experience (the film was rated R for good reason). Despite the perspective of having nightmares about zombies for the rest of my life, I suddenly enjoyed the film. Macabre atmosphere, unbearable tensity, amount of bloody scenes-that's all I really loved in that film, and even now my opinion is still the same.",,Anonymous,Horror

a remake that has no right to be good (but is anyway)...,"Not too long ago, Hollywood rode high on the crest of the teen-horror revival (begun by Wes Craven's ""Scream"") as a glut of winking slashers designed to make us nostalgic for the franchise staples of yesteryear(""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", etc.) became the main attraction at multiplexes the world over. Not surprisingly, what at first looked like a trend proved a mere fad and fizzled out in a fraction of the time it took to put Freddy and Jason down. These films were little more than self-conscious showcases for vapid pretty faces with little in the way of acting talent, and CGI-approved gore that made one nostalgic for hand-made FX.Therefore, with Hollywood running low on creative ideas (what else is new?), the teen-horror infatuation was abandoned (or perhaps more accurately, 'transposed') in favor of 'remake mania.' In hopes of snaring both the curious and ignorant, those charming studio executives have shamelessly gone for the throat--especially in the horror genre--in cranking out one soulless remake after another. We're at the point now where there's a direct correlation between using horror remakes as an excuse to launch the film careers of music-video directors, and the results are accordingly shallow product. This raises the question of the necessity of remakes, especially remakes of films that, in most regards, leave no room for improvement and at best will only be perceived as failed hackwork? Why not create a good film out of one that is a piece of unredeemable garbage? Paradoxically, the films of Ray Dennis Steckler or Ed Wood, while incendiary, low-budget, and considered by many to be awful, still attract a cult following that would be just as upset as those who loved, say, George Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" and were slack-jawed in horror at the notion of it being remade.With every reason to be skeptical and expectant of a rotten retread in the best-case scenario, Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" takes all the money-grubbing remakes of late (hello, ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""!) to task, and in turn shows what a good remake should be. (At the very least, he shows a reverence that is seriously lacking in the horror genre.) As if aware of the sheer inability to match the wit, intelligence, and horror of Romero's original, screenwriter James Gunn (who previously scripted Troma films) takes the skeletal structure of the original and infuses it into a modern telescope. As before, we are introduced to the survivors of a plague that has swept the world, seeking refuge in a shopping mall. As opposed to the blue-faced, slow-moving zombies of Romero's original, the dead of ""Dawn 2004"" are rotten-faced speed freaks who dash crazily after humans who let their guard down. The details of the plague are left appropriately vague--Snyder is less concerned with the cause than he is with knocking you out of your seat (which happens time and again); whereas Romero's film was a more relaxed meditation on consumer culture, Snyder seldom allows time for the audience to catch their breath, as he is staging one elaborate jolt after the next. Oddly enough, this method consistently holds up, and while it can easily be decried as skimping on the depth of Romero's original, it glues you to the screen all the same, and in my opinion, that is a different kind of success.Granted, when the survivors start piling up, few ever get out of the first dimension, but dimension is irrelevant so long as the 1-D characters are given splatterific deaths (I was surprised the chainsaw dismemberment didn't give this an NC-17). After all, within the first few minutes we can pretty much tell who will be around at the climax and who won't. Perhaps there was more CGI used in this film than I noticed, and Snyder's gritty style (which employs a certain dank paleness) obscured it a bit; in any case, the zombie and human kills, and the way they are photographed, is presented with a rollicking intensity that few films of late have shown. ""Dawn 2004"" is what ""28 Days Later"" would have been had it jettisoned its preachy plot. Whether the decision to make the zombies fast-moving savages was an effort to create tension or appeal to our attention-deficit society, it works on both counts.Ultimately, ""Dawn 2004"" is an example of a remake done properly, even though I still have the vaguest notion of what a remake really should be. No, it doesn't come anywhere near Romero's social statement, nor his dynamic precision in presenting believable, everyday characters, but it entertains, it frightens, and is bloody fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A more than worthy remake of the best movie of all time,"Some are bothered that there would be an attempt at a remake of such a classic as the original Dawn of the Dead. This is not a typical remake but as the director said it is a re-imagining. I loved the first movie and loved this movie. I absolutely refuse to compare the two as each has its own qualities and inspirations. I can only say I left the theater with an ache in my neck from the tension.The opening of the movie, as many have said, is as scary as any movie ever made. Although I would have liked to have seen more of societies break down, the opening credits did a wonderful job of a quick summary of the fall of civilization.The pure terror and shock that Ana must have felt was superbly displayed in the opening scene. Watching the DVD over and over, I can find different attacks and reaction by several neighbors. The whole scene does a fabulous job of showing absolute kaos descending upon suburbia.There may have been some disposable characters, and sometimes the characters did not behave in ways in which we think we would have acted. But how many times do large groups of people, under great stress always do the right thing. Overall, absent the unreality of the movie, I thought it portrayed the people in a very real way. Excellent acting, story, camera work and worthy of being a re-imagining of the best movie of all time.The DVD also explains many plot holes that may have been found in an initial theatrical viewing, either via Andy's tape, the news reports or deleted scenes.Finally do not turn the movie off before the closing credits end. This is one of the few movies to watch from the opening frame until the last credit is over.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Dead Again,"Zack Snyder's ""Dawn of the Dead"" gets off to a shaky start by not improving upon the original ""Night of the Living Dead"" image of the innocent neighbor girl turned brain-eating zombie (1968's cellar dwelling Kyra Schon was the original). But, by the time nurse heroine Sarah Polley (as Ana) hits the road, all is forgiven. This film lives up to its DVD sleeve description: ""When a mysterious virus turns people into mindless, flesh-eating zombies, a handful of survivors wage a desperate, last-stand battle to stay alive and human! Exploding with terrifying surprises and nerve-shredding fun, 'Dawn of the Dead' is an edge-of-your-seat thrill-ride."" This one doesn't make the same subtle points as the earlier ""Dead"" films (real or imagined), it's predictable, and it tailspins in a dumb ending. Still, its strengths are considerable; the debut direction, dynamic relationships, superior gore effects, and excellent characterizations are... to die for.******* Dawn of the Dead (3/10/04) Zack Snyder ~ Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Gross, Funny, Good","I'll be the first to admit that the horror genre is not high on my list of favorites, so I'll freely admit I'm not as qualified to comment on 'Dawn of the Dead' as some. But I have to say the remake is just better than the original. I like the 1978 version of 'Dawn of the Dead,' and I was skeptical when I first heard about the remake to the point of being dismissive about it. But the effects were better, the sequences tighter, and the sense that the characters were really fighting for their lives much more immediate. The first ten minutes alone are more intense than anything that happens in the original (I know, I know, but, by comparison, the opening moment of the 1978 film are a disorienting, absurdly gory, muddled mess). I also know that the movie breaks a cardinal rule of the zombie film by allowing the zombies the ability to move quickly, but it really only helps the movie. Frankly, I think it's a lot scarier to have a raving thing come at you at top speed rather than just kind of lumber. I'll agree, the gallows humor and social commentary of the original are missing, but so is the bicycle gang.I mean, really.Come on.What was that about?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bloody good remake,"DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) ***1/2 Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer, Michael Kelly. Bloody good remake of George A. Romero's cult classic zombie sequel to his original cult classic 'Night of The Living Dead' again with a small band of people holed up in a shopping mall and forced to fight off a plague of sudden zombies that are ravenous for flesh and brains. Novice director Zack Snyder keeps the kinetic pace to a feverish giddy high with a sprinkling of humor amidst the horror thanks to James Gunn's lively screenplay mixing action and gross-out violence (an aside: could've been meatier for my tastes but what can I tell ya) with deft aplomb and clever camerawork with a bruised glaring palette by Matthew F. Leonetti, sharp editing by Niven Howie and nasty make-up effects by David LeRoy Anderson. Polley is surprisingly gung-ho while Rhames and Weber make for excellent heroic types in a sea of oncoming carnage. Look sharp for the original film's stars Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger and Tom Savini in cameos.",,Anonymous,Horror
Not bad - but lacks the intelligence of the original,"Romero has the zombie flick sewn up. Nobody to-date has ever done it better. This DOTD remake is a good horror movie, but it fails to convince me that it has any purpose other than to provide a piece of disposable entertainment. You watch it. You comment on how it ""lacks the subtext or intelligence of the original"". You forget about it. The classic DOTD can't be forgotten, it is so pointedly brilliant in its ideas, its editing, its directing, its entire execution. Okay okay, so the makeup effects have been vastly improved these days but once you dig down past the eye candy the 2004 remake has very little on offer. Give it another 20 years, people will still be talking about Romero's vision. The 2004 version will be lost somewhere in remake hell.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hairs-standing-on-end,Is this the best remake of all time? When I first watched this when it came out I thought it was average at best but rewatching it nearly 20 years later I think this is one of the best remakes ever. I'm not saying it is better than the original but it comes very close. The gore is excellent and feels very real as they are real. The more action sequences have a lot of visual effects but they work for action with detracting from the excitement. The human elements are so well done. There are plenty of hairs-standing-on-end moments but also exciting and shocking scenes. There is very little time to relax and no room for boredom. Highly recommended so long as you go into this open minded.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror

What Richard Matheson by way of George Romero has wrought...,"Filmmaker George Romero has often cited Richard Matheson's classic SF shocker I AM LEGEND as the inspiration for his chiller NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. In Matheson's short story, DANCE OF THE DEAD, a ""loopy"" comes twitching to life before a crowd of onlookers (""loopy"" being a play on ""Lifeless Undead Phenomenon""). Unlike the vampires in I AM LEGEND, the zombie in DANCE OF THE DEAD is slow-moving and uncoordinated. Like the walking dead in Romero's classic(s). (Or perhaps Romero found inspiration in the first feature based on Matheson's I AM LEGEND, THE LAST MAN ON EARTH; certainly the living dead in Romero's movie mimic the ponderous, slow-moving vampires therein- not to mention the undead in INVISIBLE INVADERS.)In the ""remake"" of DAWN OF THE DEAD (a remake in name only), the zombies are even closer to the vampires that originally inspired them. They are no longer the lumbering, slow-moving creatures that we've all come to know and love. Like the zombies in RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD, the reflexes haven't slowed since death. This makes for an even bleaker scenario than in the Romero films (in which there often seems to be, somewhere in the gloom, a faint ray of hope, however dim): not only do you need to be faster than the guy next to you, you need to be able to outrun creatures impervious to pain; creatures dying, if you will, to taste your very flesh...The film starts off well, but begins to lose focus as characters crowd in on one another, with ""throwaway"" victims introduced just minutes, in some cases, prior to their deaths. (It's hard- if not impossible- to feel for these ""throwaways,"" as we learn very little about them.) The interplay between the principals, however, more than makes up for the shortcomings of the diversionary deaths. (In all frankness, the gratuitous gore is a given in these movies- it's part of their allure-, but makeup fx alone do not a worthwhile feature make.) All in all, a topnotch entry in the (sub-)genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Brilliant Redux - wished I had a few more bites,"And now, a clinical dissection of many critic's most common beefs with this film.These Zombies are fast  That also makes them scary; a Romeroesque zombie poses little threat to anybody with a sledgehammer, and actually might be fun to deal with if you've got a twelve gauge, .o6, etc and a good back-up man. Don't believe me?  Watch `Night' or `Dawn', the characters themselves are laughing it up in multiple sequences. That slow zombies could overwhelm the combined might of America's hunters, police, military, and tool sheds never made any real sense. I dare you to tell me different.I miss the `subtle attack on American consumerism!'  well rub the sleep out of your eyes and put away your Movie Guide books; first and foremost it wasn't that subtle, it wasn't really even that clever given that 75% of the original dawn took place in a mall. What were they suppose to allude to, the vast wasted space that are America's parking lots? Besides its been replaced successfully with a reinforcement of iron class structure  but I won't bore you with a neo-Marxist rant, you can connect those dots.This wasn't anywhere near as scary as the original Did you even see the original? Sure it was gory, but scary? What part of the pie fight was the scariest for you?Too many characters and no development  Well again, just tell me the top three things that pop into your mind about the original fab four. Not to knock the original script, but characterization was not its strong suit, the characters were nearly interchangeable. Here we get to see a true spectrum of human reaction to overwhelming tragedy. I felt for these characters, I could write a mini bio for each of them  compared to the original, I could say Roger was the white cop, what else could you add?In short, I found this a brilliant and captivating re-visioning and hope it leads to additional films for the series. It was creepy and technically well executed.

The un-dead?,"I came. I saw, I was so.....confused! Zombies are slow moving monsters, no more is the blood flowing in the veins, only motivation to movie is to eat warm blooded humans, or bugs, or animals. But because they are dead, now un-dead, limbs are harder to move because, I don't know..rigor mortus has kind of taken over, they should not move really fast or run, they may fall apart. The only thing that I can think of is that we have ""Return of the living Dead"" to thank for this, those zombies could even talk! But that film was all in fun, this film, which really should not have been remade to begin with, is just awful. And I say that it should not have been remade because the first film was way better. If they wanted the public to see it again, than what is wrong with bringing the move back to theaters the way they used to do before VHS and DVD.

Decent Pop Culture Nihilism,"If nothing else, the phenomenal popularity of Zack Snyder's 2004 re-visioning of DAWN OF THE DEAD is proof positive that deep down inside our contemporary youth culture is still as morose and titillated by carnage & destruction as mine was. I missed the frenzy of excitement + hype over this film at the time of release, too fully absorbed in my own fascination with European made horror from the 60s and 70s to be bothered with a modern day remake of anything by George A. Romero. A remake of his 1978 DAWN OF THE DEAD seemed especially futile since part of the reason why that movie worked is as a reaction against the tacky polyester disco suit pop culture of the Carter years. People whine about Bush but I had to live through Carter and trust me, it was worse, though after seeing it Snyder's remake I can say it is exactly the movie that the post 9/11 War On Terror era had coming. In spite of its grim source material the film manages to upbeat, exciting, engaging, and most of all fun. Go figure.Was Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD fun? Kind of, or rather its satire angle gave the mayhem a kick in the pants that was absent from so much of the similar material from the era. Much of it was genuinely hilarious within the context of the film like the priceless epic fail gag where the zombie rises up to attack only to have the top of its head lopped off by a helicopter blade. We had been waiting nearly 20 years to see something like that and at the time it brought down the house. But one of the reasons why Romero's DAWN worked so well is the plodding, relentless course of doom that focuses the film's central themes of the world having come to an end. Even an idyllic life in a fully stocked shopping mall won't cut it, with the primary underlying conflict in the film being providing the survivors with a reason to get the hell out of there.Snyder's remake does an admirable job of imparting that need before its survivors even get settled in for the long haul. I never felt at home in this mall, which was so impersonal and unaccommodating that even the toilets were fakes in the home decor shop the primaries are forced to bed down in. Then again the film never pauses to really let them get used to being there -- something the 1978 version went to great lengths to depict -- with the zombies existing almost as a Greek chorus to keep the plot moving along. Random new characters are inserted to up the body counts and provide emotional draws for the audience to identify with, including a cute dog put to work in the crux scene where the film starts to spiral out of control and they are finally forced to abandon the mall to the zombies.Who are more interested in chasing down the surviving humans en masse like they were storming a free Michael Jackson concert. Similar to the creatures in Umberto Lenzi's CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD the zombies are fast, deadly, and instinctively trained in hand to hand combat, a fringe benefit of being bitten & transformed. To hell with bombing Iran, we should set a horde of zombies loose on them and flood the airwaves with Johnny Cash songs. They'd go belly up inside of a week. The one complaint I had about the zombies was that fighting them off became a video game, complete with a sewer level where they lost the blue key while getting fresh ammo packs + quad damage. When the movie finally sputtered to an end all I could think was, What no Boss Monster? Which might come across as a criticism but then again this is the visual language that the target audience (10 to 40 year old tech savvy consumers) knows & speaks best. I was grateful Snyder spared us having to use cheat codes on a Thrall map.A subtle zombie movie wouldn't have been appropriate either, with the mold for the film's approach lying somewhere between the Italian horror epics and Dan O'Bannon's punk rock RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD. But unlike that film Snyder's remake retains an air of sobriety and grim seriousness that was strangely refreshing, and quite fitting for some of the 9/11 era images of urban destruction it depicted. There was one shot of a street littered with office paper that was right out of the WTC photo memorials, and Snyder's makeup crew did a marvelous job of creating their zombies by basing the imagery on autopsy photos. All of it felt quite real even if the primary focus of the cinematographers was to find white surfaces for brains to splatter on when a zombie got shot in the head. But hey, that comes with the territory.The film had two great contributions to zombie lore as well, first with Michael Kelly's superb character of C.J. the cynical security guard, and a zombie baby birth that like the head in the helicopter blade gag was exactly what we had been waiting another 20 years to see. Ving Rhames also created an excellent character with his gruff Officer Ken, and the film manages to maintain a level of mayhem throughout its length that is quite worthy of the traditions on which the movie drew (including a first rate quickie scene of a Presidential Guard detail gunning down a group of journalists who get to close: my kind of stuff!). All of it works pretty well though it is definitely more of a ""re-visioning"" of Romero's scenario rather than a remake. I guess they felt compelled to re-use the title as an homage because its a very different film, very well made and very worthy of being seen. Even if nobody actually gets eaten.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A worthy remake...,"I loved the original Dawn of the Dead. I remember seeing it as a young kid and being fascinated, shocked, repulsed and excited by the imageries shown in that film. The movie represented for me at the time everything that was adult and taboo.The new remake is a complete makeover of the original: it is made for the MTV generation, with fast editing, quick pacing and unrelenting action. In other words, the new DOD is intended for mass consumption. And that is not a bad thing if it is done right, and, in my opinion, the new DOD gets it right.There are more characters than in the original. And the new film clocks in at way below the two hour mark, whereas, if my memory serves me right, the original ran much longer than 2 hrs. The new version, therefore, lacks clearly defined characters, and the pacing of the film seems somewhat rushed under the limited time constraint.However, the film is a hoot. It is briskly paced and the action sequences are furious at times. Also, it is a scary film. What the film lacks in characterization, it wholly makes up for it by turning the action meter on up high.Undeniably, there will be die-hard fans of the original who will dismiss the new version as a needless remake. That is their right, and I support their right to their opinions. However, the new DOD is entertaining in its own right, i.e., as a divergent, action-oriented horror film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lions and Tigers and Emmitt Smiths-Oh My!!!,"Unlike my reaction to most remakes, I was happy when I first heard that they were remaking ""Dawn of the Dead"", the story is so irresistible that it could be remade ten times and each would still be entertaining. And I was sure they could do a whole lot better than George Romaro's third installment, the awful ""Day of the Dead"". Seeing the remake did not change my opinion, I found it fun entertainment and better than ""Day"". But I am hoping for still another remake because while better than ""Day"", it was not even remotely in the class of ""Night"" or the first ""Dawn"". It was about on a par with ""Return of the Living Dead"". Hopefully Romaro's new ""Land of the Living Dead"" will be a worthy companion to ""Night"" and to the original ""Dawn""..The remake started out well and it worked fine as long as Sarah Polley was the central character, but once they got into the mall the wheels fell off and the whole thing became very ordinary. And I was stunned by how bad the editing was with jump cuts and puzzling gaps in the storyline. While these may have been due to production issues, the lazy hack job done on titles and credits makes the post-production folks the most likely suspects.The biggest controversy is a shuffling zombie vs a running zombie. A single shuffling Romero zombie was not particularly dangerous and it was only a crowd of zombies that posed much of a threat. So having a running zombie helped to close the main plot hole in Romero's films-it never made sense that something that slow and stupid could have taken over. But a shuffler is a far more frightening image because zombies are about entropy, a symbol of individual humans and eventually the entire human order breaking down. Slow rot that eats away everything human in everyone else until it devours you alive. Barely ambulatory supports this fear far better than zombies that run like Emmitt Smith.I did generally enjoy this movie. But the comments on IMDb are far too often of the ""best ever"" ""worst ever"" type; useless to the prospective viewer. So for the benefit of those viewers I will again say that while the remake doesn't suck, it is extremely flawed and is only a pale shadow of the original. It is silly for us to accept that something this imperfect is anywhere near the best that can be expected from modern horror-especially since the illogic of such a belief is exposed by many classic horror movies, which create better horror and more suspense in subtle ways that does not need to overwhelm us to throughly scare us. So if someone calls this effort a classic, you can safely assume that they have not seen much else that the genre has to offer, or that they are as brain-dead as a zombie (but maybe not as brain-dead as those, and there are some out there, who thought ""Day of the Dead"" was the best of Romaro's trilogy).",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Faithful to the original classic, but there's no need to bring 28 Days Later into this.","George A. Romero's ""Dawn of the Dead"" back in 1978 was a masterpiece in horror cinema that not only did I say it is the best horror movie of it's kind, but I ranked it on my top ten list of best films of all time.Just like many movie studios, everybody wants to remake classic films to give them a little edge. Some of them worked from Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear (1991) to Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) where it was about different points of view and trying so hard to be faithful to their counterparts. Other remakes never fulfilled like Gus Van Sant's Psycho (1998) where it felt like I was watching the film but in color with goofier content.Here in the remake of DOTD, Zack Synder, who would later direct 300, paces up to speed where after watching 28 Days Later...(2002), he wants his zombies in America to run faster compared to the slow and smart zombies in Romero's movies. The film starts with Ana (Sarah Polley) coming home from the late shift at a hospital where she falls to bed with her husband before seeing a little girl filled with blood in her mouth approaching the married couple where Ana's husband is attacked and turned into a wild and venomous monster within seconds and after her flesh. She flees her home and sees hell breaking out from car crashes, people begging to be safe from the creatures; some are even being devoured by the cannibals in front of her eyes. She meets up with survivors Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a cop with a shotgun; Andre (Mekhi Phifer) a thug who has his Russian pregnant wife; and then there's Michael (Jake Weber) a TV salesman. The five of them head for the mall where they noticed that they're not alone with three security guards and other people getting involved where they witness that an epidemic has hit the scale with people turning into these creatures. The mall is filled with ravenous zombies but not before they make their hideout their sweat haven.The film also makes references to the original masterpiece where the stores are named after actors from the 1978 movie to even cameo appearances from Ken Foree, Tom Savini and Scott Reinger.I liked the film. It was a little edgier and much, much more violent and graphic than the original.

School report about this wonderful film,"Dawn of the Dead was recreated just a few short weeks ago. The original screenplay, written by George A. Romero, was combined with the one written more recently by James Gunn. I think Gunn did a wonderful job keeping the original story intact while adding a bit of humor and his own style to the movie. The movie was directed by Zack Snyder and produced by Eric Newman, Marc Abraham, and Richard Rubinstein. It was done by Universal studios and was released in March 2004. The movie is rated R for pervasive strong horror violence and gore, language and sexuality. The leading actors were well chosen in my opinion, and include Sarah Polley as the lead actress and Ving Rhames and Jake weber as leading actors. I think this movie fits in well with Romero's former films. Although it has a bit more humor to it, it still retains the original gore and horror. This movie will shock you at some points, and have you giggling at others. It's a wonderful remake of a wonderful movie. The plot can simply be summarized as `zombies are killing EVERYONE,' which is to be expected when seeing a Romero film. It starts out in a small town, showing the havoc that this new virus is reeking. No one is sure exactly what is going on, but the only sure thing is to watch your back at all times. People are on a rampage, killing and eating everyone in site. One woman runs into a cop, who lets her tag along with him. They soon find 3 more folks who are heading to the mall. As anyone who has seen the original will know, this is where the bulk of the movie will take place. The long series of scenes at the mall are very different. Some are humorous, while others are violent and gory. The movie rolls onward as the plan their escape from the mall, and they venture outward. The acting was very well done. I very much enjoyed how Ana, or Sarah Polley, didn't act like most women in zombie movies. She took situations head on, and didn't scream and whine about what was occurring. Kenneth, or Ving Rhames, was a very good team `badass.' He made sure stuff was done right. Michael, or Jake Weber, added a sense of romance, while still adding to the comedic value of some scenes. As in the original `Night of the Living Dead,' we are given someone to hate. We hated `Cooper' in that one and we definitely hate, or love, Steve in this movie. He did a great job of p***ing everyone off and saving his own ass in all situations. All things considered, I think the cast did a great job of recreating this masterpiece. Several camera angles were used throughout the movie to show that a surprise was coming. You see someone go to a door and slowly open it, showing a close-up of the person of the door handle, only to find a zombie jump out at them. The slowed down movement lets you know something is going to happen, but it always scares you when it does. I don't understand why, but this technique seems to always do its job. One technique which has been widely used lately, was the combining of comedy with horror. This movie however, I believe utilizes this technique to the fullest. `Scary Movie' for example, completely got rid of the horror while adding a large amount of comedy. This was somewhat of a letdown as it turned from horror spoof, into `stupid teen comedy.' `Dawn of the Dead' added comedy amidst the horror, but only at appropriate times. At times where there was a break in the action, or times when you would least expect it, the writers through in a joke, or ironic situation to keep the viewers laughing and scared at the same time. The production techniques used and many of the camera angles added to the already wonderful story in the film. I've read before that there was symbolism behind the mall itself. The original was put out at a time when malls were beginning to gain popularity. People were flocking to malls to get `whatever they wanted' in one place. So these people, in a time of terror, go to the mall. Some believe Romero was mocking the population in some respects, since these people did not spend all their time trying to better their situation, but used much of it just getting `whatever they wanted. This time however it was free, and it showed the greed of humans. Greed, or in this case selfishness, can lead to stupid situations. One man ties his dead, now `zombified,' wife to a bed in an attempt to bring his unborn child into the world. He knows the pain and suffering he is putting his wife through, but continues to do it. His situation does not, however, end up exactly as planned. This is another way Romero and Gunn could be mocking the population. I think the underlying theme behind much of this movie is that humans are stupid, greedy, and self centered. I would give this movie a 10/10, had it been filmed in Monroeville Mall. (Since I am from Pittsburgh) However, I will still give it a 9/10. I highly suggest seeing it, but not until you see the original. I would also suggest seeing the original Dawn of the dead, Day of the dead, Night of the Living dead, and Return of the dead, although Return is not a Romero film. I would also urge you to go see this movie now. Don't wait for it to come out on video, as it is one of my favorite movies of late. The humor adds so much to this wonderful classic, which can appeal to any audience, young or old.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great first half,"I can't even begin to explain how much I loathe stupid movies. You know when the creators put all the effort in trying to make the crowd impressed with special effects and having us jump out of our seats instead of making it smart and more ""realistic"". This one has so many flaws I can't even remember all of ´em. The first half is slow paced and very powerful but after that it's totally lacking competence. The later half is filled with stupid ""mistakes"" much gore/splatter (which I enjoyed as hell though)and very stupid people. It get so predictable you can't imagine your eyes. Well now i´m bored writing about it. When I summon the movie together I decide to totally flush it down the toilet. 2/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Barricade your self in the nearest Theater and see this one!,"If you are a big fan of Zombie or suspense filled horror movies then this is a movie for you. Not exactly a remake but a retelling of the old 'Dawn of the dead. The same premise is there, survivors seek refuge in a mall from the Zombie horde, but all else is gone. The Special Effects are well done and the acting is on par with a decent movie. Much better than the Zombie movies of old. Not to mention the shambling zombies of old are gone. The fresh ones will give any track star a real run for their money.So in short if you go see one horror movie this spring see ""Dawn of the Dead""I give it 4 Stars out of 5P.S.

A decent remake and first effort from Zack Snyder,"Usually sequels are planned to be released in an ordered process. The standard lead time is between two to three years. Sometimes there are delays which can push it out. Then there are also the rushed ones where a film is pumped out in a little longer than a year's length. To do that is nuts but it's proven to be done before. For George A. Romero, it seems he truly went at his own pace when it came to making his movies. Even though Romero had worked on other films in between the ""dead"" entries, the intervals at which each film came out was almost consecutively ten years apart. That's a long time. Weirdly enough, it seems the remakes of his films are following the same path despite him not even being involved. While Night of the Living Dead (1990) was an amicable update to the original, it did have some issues. Almost fifteen years later, came this sequel. It's about the same but for some different reasons.The setup to the story is the same as the original involving a bunch of strangers taking refuge in an abandoned shopping mall after the world is turned upside down with undead corpses attacking the living. This was directed by newcomer at the time Zack Snyder, who is now best known for several comic book related films. Before this Snyder was directing music videos, similar to Michael Bay's startup before turning action director. The screenplay was written by James Gunn, the same person who is also best known for his array of comic book films too. Before this though, there was hesitation for him writing for this production. Reason being, that his biggest credit at the time was penning the script for the live-action Scooby-Doo (2002) film. And of course, most know pretty well how that movie did with viewers and fans alike.The cast of actors to play these everyday people are Ana (Sarah Polley) a nurse, Kenneth (Ving Rhames) a cop, Michael (Jake Weber) a TV salesman, Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and Luda (Inna Korobkina) and CJ (Michael Kelly) a security guard to the mall along with his rookie Terry (Kevin Zegers). Together these main characters spend most of their time together in the mall. There they learn about their histories as well as how to cope with what's around them and support each other. This script includes way more characters in general than that of the original but it works out okay. Gunn even has a couple twists in the story that can play to the opposite to what viewers may expect for certain characters. Sarah Polley is a good lead and being that her character's a nurse, growing accustomed to the horrors around her seemed easier to handle. The same could be said for Ving Rhames as the cop.Jake Weber although plays what seems like a wimpy character quickly toughens up. And of all thespians, the actor who has the best lines and best character arc goes to Michael Kelly. Clearly it looked like he had the most fun. However, this does not totally omit any typical character tropes seen in other horror films. Two good examples of this are Mekhi Phifer's role and Ty Burrell as some snobby rich guy. Guess one can't avoid all the pitfalls. Yet casting director Joseph Middleton was able to nab Ken Foree, Tom Savini and Scott H. Reiniger from the original film for cameos. Very nice. Still there is one other thing that's a bit odd that likely was not mentioned in any other zombie film which was raised here. Apparently dogs can run circles around zombies and not be seen as food? That's something new...why's that? Unanswered question. Additionally, the zombies in this film are far more aggressive as opposed to all others featured before. They run now.Visually, as Snyder fans would come to know and love, the film is very good looking. The special effects look mostly practical which is good because even for 2004, CGI didn't always look real. Behind the camera was Matthew F. Leonetti, a cinematographer with quite a history behind him. Before this he had worked on Raise the Titanic (1980), Poltergeist (1982), Hard to Kill (1990) and Rush Hour 2 (2001). Finally, the film score was composed by Tyler Bates. For this project Bates had the chance to make something of the franchise being that none of the films ever had a signature identity. He didn't do that though, but managed to still create themes that worked for the scenes. Before this, Bates' most notable credit was to another remake by name of Get Carter (2000), another film from the 70s.For a remake, it entertains surprisingly well even though there are still some regular clichés the genre will come across. These small flaws are made up for through the actors' performances, the music, special effects and camerawork.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zombies in mirror are closer than they appear...,"When I first rented this film, I was astounded. Simply astounded. I found this film to be the best zombie film that I had seen in ages. The effects were amazing, and the story was riveting.In the film, it appears as though a young woman works as a nurse who wakes up one morning and finds out that almost every single person is a flesh-eating zombie who wishes to bite the other people that they too, may be the undead. With this happening, she drives off, hoping to escape, but crashes her car, only to be rescued by a police officer, a pregnant woman and her husband, and a man who once sold televisions. The five seek refuge in a mall, and are almost refused by some security guards, who the five civilians imprison to save themselves, and save a truckload of some refugees who escaped the zombies' wrath, when they lock up the place. With this, the zombies stay tirelessly and relentlessly outside of the mall in the hopes of capturing the people inside, while the people themselves have a multitude of conflicts within the building.This film is clearly for those who enjoy a horror with a plot twist in it. One such flaw with this film is that it depicts zombies in a different direction than that which most fans are acclimated to seeing. While the story itself has its weak points, it is not without its good sides.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
way more entertaining than original,"Remakes. that word sometimes makes me cringe. we have a slew of them getting churned out of hollywood these days. some work, i.e. the ring and the texas chainsaw massacre and well, some don't. (shaft always comes to mind on this one.)as i entered the theatre with my wife and brother, my expectations were high for this. after a few trailers we were off and running. i had already previewed the first ten minutes of this film on the USA network and i was already intrigued. From there, the movie never let's down. We are quickly met with a few survivors who, as anyone already knows, decides to take refuge in the mall. When they arrive in the mall, they meet up with a few security guards and decide to whole up there for a while. later on, a few more survivors show up and carnage ensues.Now, what makes this one more different and better to me than the original are these few things:1.)when they arrive at the mall, it's closed. hasn't even open for business yet so there are no zombies inside.2.) the use of shuttle busses at the end was creative. i like that touch. use what you got.3.) the humor was excellent4.) the characters were great, especially cj and michael and ving rhames character. sarah polley was given a strong female character in ana. thank you for giving a strong actress a strong role.this movie is far better than the original and if you don't sit through the credits, you may miss something special.by the way, the whole baby thing almost lost me on this movie, that was the only one cheese factor.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

A great debut from Snyder!,"DotD is not nearly as scary as it is haunting. It masterfully paints a small world from the start, so it shrinks at an alarming rate once the excrement hits the oscillator. The zombies become an overwhelming antagonist, closing in on the survivors fast enough to make you realize they simply postponed their deaths.The acting is what you would expect. Nothing horrendous, but nothing great. There are some lines here and there that will make you roll your eyes, but nothing that makes you grind your teeth. I like the absence of recognizable actors (with the exception of Ving Rhames and Mehki Phifer, of course) because it adds to the illusion that this kind of nightmare could come true.My one real gripe with the film is that it is unabashedly violent. It takes any and every opportunity to splatter some gore, and it gets tiresome toward the end. I'm not complaining that it desensitizes the audience (even though it does), just that it looses its coolness after a while.Dawn of the Dead isn't perfect. It suffers from a lot of nasty Hollywoodisms and abuses just about every horror movie tactic in the book. Spooky sound effects, inhuman screeches, close-ups of bullet casings hitting the floor... (And, of course, everybody become expert marksmen when it comes to head shots.) Still, it succeeds in what it sets out to do: scare the hell out of the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good Even with the Flaws,"Dawn of the Dead (2004)*** (out of 4)Remake of George A. Romero's 1978 masterpiece has a zombie outbreak happening and a group of survivors take shelter inside a mall. At first the diverse group of people are fighting but they finally come together to try and survive the ordeal.In my opinion, the original DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the top three horror films ever made so going into this remake expecting it to live up to that would be rather stupid. The first time I watched this film I really didn't like it and to this day I must admit that I have a problem with these super fast, superhero like zombies. With that said, this second viewing of this 2004 version actually worked a lot better and I found myself enjoying the film even with its flaws.I must also admit that I'm not the biggest fan of director Zach Snyder. For the most part I think he brings a lot of flash and style to his movies but very little substance and I thought that was the case here. I thought the film was way too flashy for its own good and I must say that I didn't even like the look of the movie. As I previously stated I'm not really a fan of the fast zombie but I really disliked the various CGI zombies here as well as the way some of them seemed to be better fitted for a MATRIX movie.Having said all of that, I still find myself enjoying the characters and the performances from the actors. The film actually had a few nice ideas and I must admit that I liked the rather grim outcome and the fact that none of the characters were really safe. The film also benefits from some nice changes in the story including what impact the gun store has on the outcome. The mall setting was just a great idea by Romero and while it's not used as well here it's still a good option to have.DAWN OF THE DEAD isn't a masterpiece like the original but even with all of the flaws it's still an entertaining movie.",,Anonymous,Horror
Satiric but not Satanic. Dawn of the Dead can't live up to the great original,"Screenwriter James Gunn tries to add some new twists to George A. Romero's creepy 1978 script. But it's a hard act to follow. Our story follows registered nurse Ana ( Sarah Polly ) Who takes to the hillswith the rest of the Milwaukee area after her husband is murdered along with half the town by packs of rampaging zombies. It isn't long before she crashes her car off the panicked highway and runs into still human police officer Ken, played by the always excellent Ving Rhames. Banding together while dodging and executing the zombies alike, they meet up with a few more straggling survivors led by Mikhi Pfifer who has a pregnant girlfriend in desperate tow. In dire need of a safe house, and learning that many potential havens have been overrun by the bloodthirsty dead. They finally have to settle for breaking in to a large shopping mall. The problem with this, compared to Romero's genius original idea is that all the surprise element is gone for fans of the 1978 film. And the shocking quaintness of the inhabitants taking advantage of the mall's finer points seems lost in the shuffle of some pointless twists. In other words, during Romero's story, you could feel enough horror as to where you could picture yourself locked inside the mall. And you could relate to the extreme relief the raiders would be feeling in that situation. I didn't feel the same sense of urgency and therefore terror here. We don't even see that much of the mall. Instead, we have a revolving door of new characters most soon to be zombie food. And none all that interesting. In the original the cast was narrowed. Making it much easier to cozy up to the characters. Here a hard rock soundtrack keeps kicking in, not much of a substitute for Romero's eerie elevator music. There are some pluses, both Phifer and Rhames give credible performances as men in an impossible situation. Seeing how naturally these fine African American actors blend seamlessly with the rest of the cast, is a credit to Romero's vision. When 'Night of the Living Dead' debuted in 1969, Romero was ostracized for going with a black or 'Negro' leading man. He was told at the time that it was an outrage which would not wash with white audiences. Well here we are thirty six years later, and because of pioneers like Romero, black actors get the opportunities they deserve, while we scarcely notice the difference. All in all, I'd say 'Dawn of the Dead is not a total loss, it just doesn't approach the queasy horror of the original. And even though these zombies run much faster. Were still not quite as frightened that they might catch up. actually, this film is much more like an American version of '28 Days later' the British zombie takeoff, than it is to respecting Romero's Satanic vision. Good entertainment, but not permanently scarring horror. 6 out of a possible 10 T.H.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not bad, not great","I went into Dawn of the Dead 2004 with fairly high expectations, being a moderate fan of Romero's original trilogy. What I got was a completely different film that is good for completely different reasons. It's impossible to avoid drawing comparisons between this film and the 1978 film that inspired it because, let's face it, they consciously decided to slap the same name on it. If they had just set the movie in a police station or something, they wouldn't have had to bother paying for the name. But I guess that's just the point; the title has built-in recognition going for it.That said, this is not nearly the abomination that other recent remakes have been (Texas Chainsaw Massacre comes to mind). It has lots of great action pieces, better actors than the original, and even some nice plot additions such as a character stuck on the roof of a gunshop across the street from the mall. You actually end up caring about the guy even though you only hear his voice in one brief scene.The violence is certainly also potent, which I suppose some people will be looking for in a horror movie. I found myself terribly annoyed by the quick-cutting music-video style editing in the action scenes, but it's still a whole lot better than some other recent remakes (Texas Chainsaw Massacre comes to mind). What I admired about Romero's films, however, is that the camera never doubts the potency of a scene, and simply shows the action in mostly still frames. Romero sets up a scene, let's it happen, and then moves on. The beauty is in its simplicity. Dawn of the Dead 2004 is like a hyper-active child, which some people will surely appreciate over its wiser, if somewhat sluggish, grandfather. It's all a matter of taste.As many other have argued, however, I did miss the original's depth and satirical sense of humour. Some may argue that it was cheesy, but I still see that as being the point. Sure, it had suspense, blood, and violence, but it was never an out-right scarefest. And, you know... I don't think there was anything wrong with that. I could understand if director Zack Snyder wanted to up the adrenaline a little, but why did all the characters have to become shallow caricatures? If the original Dawn had one strength, I would say that it respects its main four characters as human beings rather than throwing them into the fray for little purpose except to become zombie-fodder. Romero allowed us time to get to know his characters, understand their motivations, their weaknesses, their relationships, etc. Having 16 (or whatever number) people tossed into the mall over a mere hour and a half restricts character development (CJ suddenly turning nice doesn't count since he was a cartoon to begin with) and severely lessens the impact when things start to go wrong.And that's another thing... As much as I hate to cram the whole ""Romero's social commentary about consumerism"" thing down more peoples' throats, its absence leaves no good reason for these characters to hide out in a mall. People in the theatre actually broke out laughing around me when one of the characters says something along the lines of, ""Hey, let's go to the mall!"" The mall isn't even in sight and so it seems like a ludicrously random destination, and probably not the safest at that. Snyder's undead seem even faster and stronger than when they were alive, so I can't imagine that 2000 (there are a lot of zombies in this film) of them wouldn't have been able to break through the mall's glass doors. Finally, although Dawn 2004 had its share of jokes, it was not as tongue-in- cheek as the original, which I thought was sorely missed. People may say the pie fight was stupid... I say it was funny. People may say the guy checking his blood pressure (while being eaten) was stupid... I say it was funny. Even the individual zombies in this film weren't vaguely memorable. You never see any of them up close for more than 2 seconds because the editing is always so fast. You always just see them as a moving mass. Fans of the original will know right away what I mean when I talk about the ghetto-apartment-huband zombie, the helicopter-sliced zombie, the zombie with the gun, the kid zombies, the bride zombie, the hare krishna zombie, etc. The zombies of Dawn 2004 are a faceless, anonymous mass. Maybe that's scarier, I don't know, but it's definitely not more interesting for someone who just wants to see some zombies.Enough harping though. In summary, Dawn of the Dead 2004 is definitely not the Dawn we've always known, but if you close your eyes during the credits (missing the title), you might enjoy it just fine as a fun, mindless action/horror flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally One of the Few Horror Remakes is Done Right.,"Gruesome... But this surprisingly entertaining remake of the original 1979 classic from George A. Romero (Which Romero will have his fourth Zombie film ""Land of the Dead"" will be released this summer). Which it has the same basic idea from the original but different in tone and a new set of characters for this updated remake. When a group of survivors (Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer, Ty Burrell, Micheal Kelly, Kevin Zegers, Micheal Berry, Inna Korobkina, Lindy Booth, Kim Poirier, Boyd Banks, R.D. Reid, Jayne Eastwood and Matt Frewer) decide to take refuge on an abandon Shopping Mall hiding from mindless, flesh-eating zombies. Trying to Survive, while the human race is becoming erased and only becoming a bed-time story for campfire tales. Those handful of survivors are trying fight a desperate battle between the survivors and these zombies but only to stay alive.This remake is directed by first time filmmaker-Zack Snyder (Snyder's next film is Rainbow Six and 300). Snyder brings a lot of energy and style to this now-familiar story but equally impressive film. This remake is exciting, violent, funny and even touching. The film also has as well of some disturbing scenes. Original Dawn-Romero's message on commercialism is lost (Since the shopping malls is outmoded anyway). Synder brings some terrific action sequences towards the third act of the film. Synder is certainly new talented director with good movies for him to come. He's one of the few movie directors that Hollywood should watch for.One of the producers of this remake is Richard P. Rubinstein (Who produced the original Romero's classic). Rubinstein is one of few people, who stayed to be involved with the remake. Tom Savini (Who was the make-up effects artist and also had a bit part as Blades), Scott H. Reiniger (Who played one of the heroes:Roger) and Ken Foree (Who played the lead hero:Peter) do excellent cameos for this remake. The Unrated Director's Cut of the Remake is certainly much better than the original theatrical release not because of the extra gore or a bit more of characters development. The Unrated Director's Cut actually corrected some of the continuity story errors from the R-Rated Version and it also make a bit more sense. Sure, the remake has a few plot holes and maybe a bit too much characters are not enough focus in this remake (Since Jake Weber is the most focus character in the remake). But this new Dawn is well cast with good performances.DVD has an sharp anamorphic widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an superb-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an engaging Commentary track by Director:Zack Synder and Producer:Eric Newman. DVD also has Deleted Scenes with/without commentary by Synder and Newman. DVD has two amusing mini-movies that inspired for this Remake but the best of all is three featurettes on the make-up effects artist by Two-Time Oscar Winner:David LeRoy Anderson. Anderson won Two Oscars on Make-Up Effects for The Nutty Professor (1996) and Men in Black (1997). DVD Features could have used more like the Original Theatrical Trailer, Interview with the Actors and why Rubinstein wanted to do a Remake of Dawn. Which Rubinstein did a commentary track for the Extended Cut of the Original-Dawn on the Dead in the Ultimate 4-Disc Edition. The Remake of Dawn is almost perfect as the Original but the only real shortcoming of this remake is the surprise end-credits, which it does push things a little too far and it seems to come from a different movie. Was it really worth the trouble ? Since the surprise end-credits wasn't part of Screenwriter:James Gunn (Best Known for writing-Scooby Doo films) original screenplay. Top Screenwriters:Micheal Tolkin (The Player) and Scott Frank (Minority Report) did some re-writes for this remake, which they are uncredited. Super 35.

It's a Great Remake But Completely Unnecessary.,"I think I like the original better. I do NOT like fast moving zombies. They just freak, me right the heck out. This lacks the light easy comedic element found in the original, but has a harder, edgier feel. It is, therefore, more reflective of the new generation, but I'm not sure that's what's best for this franchise.Either way, If you are interested in this film, you should definitely watch the original and be your own judge. That's always the best way to go, don't you think? This bears some shocking elements, some sad, others unthinkable, so if you have a weak heart or a squeamish tummy, don't attempt it. This is a zombie movie unlike the rest of the line.

A Re-Envisioning That's Actually Good!,"Okay, I saw Dawn of the Dead tonight in a sneak preview and here's what I think... (Beware of random ""stream of consciousness"" thoughts)I'm a huge fan of the original and I think this is a worthy remake. It's not without its flaws, but it is a solid film all around. I would recommend seeing it.There are several moments (for me) when I found myself saying ""what the f*** are you doing????!"" but I guess that's true of any horror film. For the most part, characters behave as I believe they would (and should) in this situation, but a few things are kind of ""out there.""The opening is fantastic (as those who've seen the first ten minutes on Sci-Fi channel can attest) and it doesn't let up from there. It draws the audience in.Many of the characters actually DEVELOP over the course of the film...a novel concept for horror buffs. Only a few characters don't grow...and you can imagine why.The ""fast zombies"" don't really bother me...they add a new dimension of terror, but might seem weird to the purists out there. Personally, I think they're TOO fast. I'd have opted for something faster than the classic zombies, but not THIS fast. I'm thinking ""speed walking"" would be ideal.There's a rather large cast here and, with the exception of one guy who can't act his way out of a wet paper bag (you'll know who he is), the acting is very solid.Whoever did the soundtrack (or made the soundtrack choices) is brilliant. You'll know what I mean when you see the movie. I nearly wet myself laughing at one point.Makeup effects are nice, as is the film quality in general. You'll know at the end why they sent the movie to the MPAA four times to get an ""R"" rating. As a side note, however, I think Passion of the Christ was probably more violent.Great dialogue...only one or two (or three) lines in the whole film could be considered ""off"" or groaners.Great sense of humor... There were a lot of ""laugh out loud"" moments to break up the tension...all well placed.  The audience really got into it.In short, go see it if you're a fan of the original or of horror films in general. You'll enjoy it. I'm about the most cynical person I know when it comes to ""remakes"" or ""re-envisionings"" of classic films and I thought this was a great effort.As I said, not perfect, but worth seeing...

It is not a perfect movie and some of the things don't make much sense to me, like if the guy with the sniper rifle was sitting on a gun shop with lots of ammo, why was he not killing more zombies, heck, he could have taken out pretty much everyone that was there and they could have took a nice gingerly drive to the marina, but overall it is a pretty good depiction of what would happen if there was a zombie outbreak, and I am now that much more prepared for what is coming around the bend, so that makes it worth seeing all by itself, although it could have done without the nudity. 3.5 Beards Out Of 5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fun, Popcorn Take on a Classic","This film I will admit, I got caught in the hype learning that this was going to be made. The original was a staple of my childhood and still one of my favorite films of all time. I'm pretty sure I saw this movie in the theater when it came out, probably more than once. It was an immediate buy and I've seen this one quite a few times. The older I've gotten though, I've slowed down and it has been a few years. I did give this a rewatch as part of the Summer Challenge Series over on the Podcast Under the Stairs for the 2000's. The synopsis here is a nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman and other survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing aggressive, flesh-eating zombies, take refuge in a mega Midwestern shopping mall.We start this in a hospital where a doctor is looking at a CT scan of someone's head. The nurse with him is Ana (Sarah Polley). The doctor asks her why this scan was done when he was admitted for a bite. She goes to the front desk to find where the patient is and we learn that he is in the ICU now.She heads home where she speaks with the little girl that lives next door, Vivian (Hannah Lochner). She promises to go skating with this girl around the block after work this weekend. Ana then goes inside for date night with her husband of Luis (Louis Ferreira). They end up making love in the shower.The next morning they are woke up by Vivian. She is missing her lips and is covered in blood. Luis goes to check on her and she bites his neck. She is knocked out of the room and they close the door. He is losing a lot of blood. He dies on the bed while Ana tries to call an ambulance. The line is busy though, which doesn't make sense. He immediately turns into a zombie, chasing his wife into the bathroom. While he is breaking in, she escapes through the window. We see outside that everything is chaos and everyone is scared. Ana drives away.This cold open ends with her crashing over an embankment and over the credits we get to see a bit more of the scope. This is worldwide and no one is really sure what is causing it. The dead though are returning to life to eat the flesh of the living.When she comes to, she escapes her car and meets a police officer named Kenneth (Ving Rhames). He's heading for a nearby military base where his brother is stationed. They encounter another group of Michael (Jake Weber), Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his pregnant girlfriend of Luda (Inna Korobkina). It is disheartening for Kenneth to learn they can't get over the road, as it is thick with zombies. They've lost most of their group in an attempt.The group together decides to head to the nearby mall. They have to break-in, but find it relatively clear of the undead. They are locked up when they run into the security crew there. This group is led by CJ (Michael Kelly), Terry (Kevin Zegers) and Bart (Michael Barry). The guards don't really like the idea of sharing their place with these new people and they lock them up. When another group drives up in a panel truck, decisions are made and those in charge are now held prisoners.They soon learn that bites because you to become one of these things. The numbers swell with Norma (Jayne Eastwood), Tucker (Boyd Banks), Glen (R.D. Reid), Monica (Kim Poirier), Frank (Matt Frewer) and Steve (Ty Burrell) hold up here. They create some sort of normal life there, but the longer they stay, the more zombies congregate outside and making it that much more difficult to leave.That recap went a little bit longer than I wanted, but that really sets the stage for the movie. I've already given my history with the movie and I'll admit, there was a stretch there where naïve, younger me thought this could be better than the original. In my defense, I was a 17 year old kid when it came out and I was high on this movie.Now that I've settled in with some life experiences and appreciate cinema more, I've come down on this movie quite a bit. Getting into podcasts really helped me to see what others thought as well. Having now watched this for the first time in awhile with a critical eye, this does do some really good stuff.This version takes out a lot of the social commentary that the original had and makes it a popcorn film. That's not meant to be a slight though. This movie is still fun to watch in my eyes. Even though it runs 101 minutes it really does just fly by. What I really like to go with that, they incorporate elements from the original, while doing their own thing and not making it a shot for shot remake. That's not to say we don't get some social commentary here still.I like we a strong woman character as our lead in Ana. She is a nurse, so it makes her important and she is trying to hold on to humanity for the society they're living in. On the flipside there is Kenneth. He is a black cop who only cares about himself. He is quite similar to CJ, but being that he was already in the mall, they fall on opposite sides. I like that they're both tough, but crack to join the cause. Michael is a character that couldn't find a place until being here. Andre seems like a criminal, or at least that's what Kenneth thinks. It does feel a bit racist though. Then there is Steve. He's rich; he's a jerk and does nothing to help. He is reaping all of the benefits, so we are getting to see classism play out on a small scale. It is a good job to have all of these different characters from all different walks of life for sure.Something I do need to address in this movie is the zombies. They're fast moving, running zombies which I'm not the biggest fan of. I know some people are and I get the appeal. They can run after you and kill you, making even one of them dangerous, especially since it is only a blow to the head that will stop them. It is even more terrifying here to see the mass numbers of that many, dangerous creatures. The problem though is that they're decaying people. They shouldn't be able to run. It loses some realism in that fact for me. I still like the tension that comes from these ones, but I prefer the slow-moving, more traditional zombies.Since I'm talking about the creatures, I'll go next to the effects. I think that all of the practical effects are good here. The make up of the zombies is good. I like what they do with the headshots and the blood that comes from it. Back in the day I watched the featurette on the DVD for it which I found interesting. They do well with having a bit of hair and scalp move at times to help as well. The CGI really doesn't hold up for me. It isn't as much as you'd expect from a Zack Snyder film, but it is still there. Plus there is just an odd filter everything is through that I've come to notice with him as well. I think some of this comes from his use of green screen if I remember correctly.To take this next to the acting, which I think is really good. Polley is solid as our lead. I used to have a bit of a crush on her, but that really isn't there anymore. She doesn't add a lot to her character. She does fit just fine. Rhames is good as that brooding, imposing guy with an attitude for sure. I like Weber. Phifer is fine. Burrell cracks me up in his role as this rich jerk. I also really like Kelly. Aside from that, Zegers, Barry, Booth, Banks and Frewer are all fine in my opinion.The last thing to go over would be the soundtrack. The normal selections for the movie I thought fit well. They help to accent the scenes. What I really wanted to talk about though are some of the other songs. There is the Johnny Cash song of 'When the Man Comes Around', Richard Cheese doing 'Down with the Sickness', Disturbed's version over the credits and some other sprinkled in there. I really like all of these and it makes me think of this movie for most of them.So now with that said, this is one that I was really high on at first and have cooled quite a bit on it. There was a stretch where I even thought I might start to hate it. That isn't the case though. This is a good movie in my opinion. It takes the hurt of the original and does its own spin on it. Not everything works for me, but I do think the acting is good on the whole. The practical effects are as well and the soundtrack really works for me. Some of the CGI doesn't and I'm not the biggest fan of the running zombies if I'm honest. Regardless, it is a fun popcorn take on a classic story.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the Few Well-Made Horror Re-Makes,"Zack Synder is one of the finest contemporary directors of our time. Here he's taken a 1978 masterpiece and has managed to create a version that pays tribute to the original but is also different enough not to feel unnecessary (kinda vice versa how ""Predators"" felt unnecessary even though it WASN'T a re-make, it sure felt like one with the countless homages). I felt the Tom Savini directed re-make of ""Night of the Living Dead"" was a great movie, while the Nick Cannon-starring re-make of ""Day of the Dead"" was just plain sh*tty. This film stands on its own remarkably well.It has awesome cameos of Tom Savini, Ken Foree and yes Scott Reiniger fans of the original will enjoy. I'm surprised they didn't sneak in George Romero in there somewhere (maybe he's one of the zombies if you look hard enough...). Any who, the characters do have less screen time individually due to a larger cast, but they're still pretty memorable. Most noteworthy of them all is Ving Rhames obviously. He's the new zombie-killing bad ass. Sarah Polley, Jake Weber, Mekhi Phifer and Michael Kelly all do really well. The director's cut is definitely the way to go, you get to further immerse yourself into the world set up by the camera. As for for the zombies, I whole heartedly prefer the original designs. The slow movement allows you to analyze the disgusting details as it were. The zombies in this film are agile and fast movers, probably somewhat inspired from the 'zombies' of ""28 Days Later"". It works because the film is aiming more for action than grueling horror which is easy to tell thru a lot of its comedic moments. And yes, credit to Tyler Bates for creating a very effective score.While not up to par with the original, this one is definitely worth a look due to a different, fast-paced direction. The director's cut is the preferred edition to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dawn of the Sickness,Well not as good as the original this remake was well made taking key elements from the original movie and modernising them whilst adding new ideas and characters into the zombie movie formula.The movie follows a small group of survivors of a zombie outbreak who decide to bunker down in a shopping mall where they have endless supplys until they are rescued but time passes by and no one comes to there aid and with the hundreds of zombies waiting at there front door they all have one question on there mind what now?.This movie came at a time when there was a lot of remakes being made and 90% of them were bad while there are some good remakes like this movie were overlooked due to oversaturation of movies attempting to cash in on peoples nostalgia.If you haven't already seen this movie I recommend giving it a watch while it's not the best zombie movie out there it still gives us what we expect blood guts guns and action.,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A true zombie flick,"The 2004 ""re-imagining"" of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is an impressive zombie movie. There will be zero comparing to the original George A. Romero movie because this reviewer had only see bits and pieces (lame pun) of that one. There will be no comparisons between the unrated edition and the theatrical cut because this reviewer never saw the theatrical version. If you decide to watch this version of ""Dawn of the Dead,"" expect lots of gore, and action, mixed in with plenty of suspense. If you expect those, you should be very pleased.A young female nurse, named Anna, is caught in the middle of a worldwide chaos as flesh-eating zombies begin taking over the world by attacking the living. She escapes into the streets and is rescued by a police officer named Kenneth. Together they find shelter in a mall, along with a group of other survivors. For a while everything is OK, but then they start running out of food, the power goes out, and the dead keep finding ways to break through their defenses. Realizing this, they must make a plan for escape. Will they find a way to survive or is the human race doomed?The first 15 minutes of this movie was one of the best introductions this reviewer had seen, not only for a horror movie but also for any type. The idea of putting a Johnny Cash song, ""The Man Comes Around,"" in the opening credits, may seem strange in a horror movie, but because of the songs post-apocalyptic feel, it fits well. It was a bold move, but it worked well. After watching the movie, you discover that putting that the addition of that Johnny Cash song was pure genius.From beginning to end, this movie grabs you by the throat and never lets you go. It starts with a creepy introduction and continues that pace throughout. This is a zombie movie, so you should expect gore and plenty of it. While this movie is advertised as a pure horror movie, it should be considered more of an action movie with elements of suspense and horror. Another great factor was that they never took this movie too seriously by adding some dark comedy to it. You also need to watch the end credits to see what happens to the remaining survivors.Throughout this movie, the main stars are the zombies. These zombies are different then the normal zombies seen in video games, movies, books, and television shows. These zombies are more realistic looking, which made them scarier. The make up was amazing and a huge improvement over the zombies in the original ""Dawn of the Dead."" Zombies could not get very much more realistic then what is shown in the 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead."" Another difference is the speed of the zombies. These zombies can run and will be able to catch you if you do not run fast enough. That made it scarier simply because you do not think the human race has a chance of survival.The actors do a decent job in making you care for their survival, even though majority of the movie was focused on the action and suspense. None of the actors did an award winning performance, but it did their jobs. Sarah Polley played Anna, the main woman who was given the most time and development. Ving Rhames plays Kenneth, a cop fighting for his survival. Mekhi Phifer plays Andre, a man having a tough time realizing that his wife, Luda (played by Inna Korobkina), may be turning into a zombie. Jake Webber plays Michael, a person you do not like at first but by the end you end up liking him.The only real defect to this version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is the writing. This is not very surprising since this is not only an action/horror movie, but also a zombie movie. There were plot holes and some things were not explained well. Some of the characters could have been expanded a little bit. Some people may complain about that, but this reviewer did not seem to mind it at all. After all, the unrated cut is 110 minutes long, which is almost two hours; no zombie movie needs to be over two hours long.Overall, this is an entertaining movie. With a $28 million budget, you should expect lots of blood and gore, realistic zombie make up, explosions with great action scenes involving: guns, saws, and other weapons. The results make this an entertaining popcorn movie you can turn your brain off to. With action, horror, and some comedy mixed in, there was everything you should expect in a zombie movie. The 2004 version of ""Dawn of the Dead"" is very recommend!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A remake that couldn't be more different,"Remakes can just copy the original(IE The Omen and psycho), or they can try to be original(The Fog which failed miserably and was terrible). Dawn of the dead keeps the basic story and that is about it. The original Dawn of the dead is one of my favorite films, so to be honest I was predisposed to hate this movie, but I didn't. The original Dawn of the dead has the usual heavy handed social commentary by Romero, and it strives to be a film that raises questions about morality and our nature. The remake leaves all that at the door and is a visual spectacle that puts its foot on the gas and doesn't take it off. It's brutal, jarring, and it works. I will say the first and last 30 minutes are near perfect horror and action sequences, while the middle tends to bog Dawn in parts. So if your wanting a horror film that examines human nature and society watch the original, if you want a movie to have a good time and some scares it's the remake, better yet just enjoy both.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Feels dated!,"One of the most highly-touted creations of this subgenre that laid the proper groundwork for generations of filmmakers yet I as a first-time viewer find it to be another of those standard, run-of-the-mill Zombie features.I know, it su@k$, but that happens (more often than you think) when you enter the party that late and by late I mean nearly two decades of time gap in between.Upon its theatrical release, way back in 2004, I am certain it had become a trendsetter, people back then were hardly familiar with the idea of flesh-eating, half-dead, half-alive creatures, thus, any film that featured such notions was bound to become the hot topic.Dawn of the Dead was no exception, but now the times have changed.We've been witnesses of countless zombie movies since its advent, it's a genre that has been done to death already, therefore, there's barely anything that fascinates me anymore. I know all the tropes, all the tricks in their bags, I can very much foresee what's gonna happen, there are no elements of surprises anymore.Still, I frequently find myself coming back to these works and that is primarily because of my deep-seated affection for the senseless entertainment they provide.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
ugh,"Somehow or another, when every other 2000-something remake of an old horror movie set off most horror purists' ""Hollywood BS"" alarms, this one managed to sneak under them. The irony is that this might be the worst of the lot, as well as the most insulting considering the original's incisive anti-consumerism subtext.Zack Snyder's directing style is everything soulless, overproduced and superficial about Hollywood regurgitated and dumbed down 10 times over, left in the freezer for a year and microwaved. Who needs grisly and grainy when everything can be shot super-clean and ""sexy"" like an MTV music video? Ah, the art of missing the point.The running zombies are stupid. I don't care about or want realism in my walking corpse movies, but turning zombies into athletic killers affects something fundamental: fear. With slow but savage, drone-like enemies, you get a sense of hope, and your mind starts mapping things out. Conversely, when everything starts falling apart, there's genuine panic, balanced and exacerbated by a faint possibility of survival. When the characters are surrounded by a thousand leopard-fast killing machines, there is no hope, so you don't care what happens, thus, there is no fear.More importantly, though, the characters are cardboard cutouts. To top it off, when the movie ends and the credits roll, we get nu-metal. The cycle of 13 year old appeal is complete.Horrible.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Enjoyable Screw Up,"As a Romero follower, I was p***ed off how the director of this movie completely screwed the original story line. Taking the original focus characters of three to over ten took away a a lot of the character development the original had. But i was happy to see the director keep similar traits that the original leads had. Ving Rhames did a great job playing the parallel of Ken Foree, even though no one can be as bad a$$ as SWATman Peter. What really bothered me was the zombies. Romero made his zombies slow, stumbling creatures. Similar Setting, similar characters, but still lacking what the original had.Though the adaptation of this movie was disappointing, as a horror movie it was awesome. The makeup artist did a phenomenal job.The blood splatter, the shooting, the gore. It was pure eye candy to a horror fanatic. All in all id give this movie a 7.5",,Anonymous,Horror

One of the best zombie movies I have seen yet..,"Wow!  This movie was really great!  After hearing that Dawn of the Dead was going to be remade, I thought that it was a great idea because the original was also good, but it needed some revamping here and there.I checked out the official site for the remake a few weeks ago and the trailers intrigued me, including the ones I watched on television.  And after finally seeing the movie this afternoon, I have no regrets.  This movie will surely make you crap your pants, especially if you watch it in the theatres.  I have to admit half of the time I was holding my hands over my ears, but it didn't keep the movie from scaring the living hell out of me.The introduction was awesome, it starts out just showing the life of an average Mom and then it ends with her waking up to a nightmare.  Even the opening credits will frighten you in a sense, since it is packed with disturbing images and clips.This movie just kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, and there were countless times where everyone else in the theatres along with me screamed and gasped from some of the zombie moments. The bad sides were there were a few unnecessary sex scenes which I don't mind, but I found them to be totally out of subject with the plot.  Eh, that's the kind of stuff that's in most good horror movies anyway. Nothing like a good ol' slash of sex and gore to disturb your audience even more.A 9/10!  I'm definitely planning to get the dvd when it comes out...  But for those who haven't seen it yet, you MUST watch this in the movie theatres when you can; the experience just won't be the same if the first time you watch it is on a dvd!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A great film, regardless of it's predecessor","Many people are giving this film low scores based simply on the fact that it's based off one of the best zombie films of all time.  I say they're morons.  Drop the Romero-elitist attitudes and recognize this film as a separate entity that deserves an unbiased and objective review, just like any other film.Now that I've said that, I'd like to say that this movie was simply awesome. This was one of the best zombie movies I've ever seen, and also a fantastic horror/action film in general.  I loved ""28 Days Later"" moreso than most, but this film blows it out of the water.  The movie sucks you right in from the very beginning.  The directing, costume/makeup and camera work is downright phenomenal for this genre.  All too often with past zombie flicks I've found myself less than pleased with the way shots were done, the way action was communicated and even the appearance of the zombies.  Not so in Dawn of the Dead.Character development is good and not overdone.  By that, I mean you learn enough about the characters to really relate to them, but you're left with enough room to imagine yourself in the same situation and develop your own view of each of the characters, instead of sitting there watching long close-ups and inner-thought dialogs wondering what the hell is going on in the character's head while the writer futilely tries to communicate some deep emotion.  This is a zombie movie, we're not here to ponder sentiment, we're here to be flung head-first into the dark, frightening, hopeless experience of Hell on Earth, and that's exactly what has been delivered with ""Dawn of the Dead"".I gave this film a 9/10.  It's my new favorite horror movie of all time (the former being Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"").  You will get the crap scared out of you, and if you like horror movies at all, you will love every second of this one. :)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
I was freaked,"Decided to watch this at night, alone. Not a good decision. Needless to say, by the end of the movie I was pretty freaked out, so much so that I had to do a quick sweep on my tiny 3 room apartment before being able to sleep. So, as far as I'm concerned, mission accomplished.I started watching it not knowing if I really wanted to devote 2 hours to it, but after the first zombie attack the action was so quick and intense my heart was racing and I couldn't turn it off even if I wanted to. The plot is so-so. Acting is good, being a horror flick, I understood that you couldn't really get attached to anyone, since they could die at any time, so I'm thinking that was why character development was minimal. The movie excelled at making the viewer tense and as uncomfortable as possible. Something about being stuck in one place while the world around you deteriorates gives me the creeps. And this movie conveys that feeling perfectly. It was gruesome, fast paced, dark, and scary. Everything a horror film should have.A good horror flick overall. For maximum effect watch alone in dark.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

The intro and outro is the absolute best I have ever witnessed on the white screen!,"Can a remake become a new era?This was the question I asked myself, when I'd finished watching the new remake of Dawn of the Dead.This movie was beyond all my expectations, and I can assure, that I actually had some pretty high thoughts about this remake.The original story is a masterpiece itself, and this new one, wasn't bad in any way. Rather the opposite, it had been remodeled and redone to fit the aspects of the time we are living in today. And I'm sure Romero is pleased with the new story.What surprised me the most was how god d**n beautiful this movie was. Every scene is like a masterpiece itself. The intro and outro is the absolute best I have ever witnessed on the white screen! I almost tried to brake into the projector room at the cinema to rewind the outro, just to watch it again.I can continue to write about how great this flick was, or i can sum it all up a bit.There are two things about Dawn of the Dead (2004), that made the biggest impact on me. no 1: The overall performance of the movie itself. no 2: The visual parts. Every scene just felt so perfect. The lighting, the environments, camera positioning, effects etc. Everything just felt like it had been trimmed to perfection!But... Dawn of the Dead is not for everyone. My mom for instance wouldn't be able to understand what made this movie so great. It is still a hardcore zombie flick. Not like 28 days later or Resident Evil.The only thing left to do, Is to hope that this movie is the beginning of a new Zombie Era!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty Average Movie,"As far as horror movies go, this was pretty average. Its best feature was, quite definitively, the special effects. The zombies looked pretty realistic, along with the blood and gore which would accompany their deaths. Unlike other horror movies, you feel more immersed because of the realistic zombies.It lacked in other departments, though. For me, it was only exciting in the beginning and the end. The middle was long and tedious, broken up only by the occasional event -- which often turned out to be a dud. There was one really strange part (more strange than scary, which is a reoccurring theme in this movie) which sort of livened things up, but other than that, it was dull in the center.The acting was convincing. There were few lines that sounded forced, and it all seemed pretty natural.Overall, a good watch if you're a fan of the horror movie genre, or if you love special effects. Most people will probably find it about average.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fun Remake,"In this remake of the classic 70's zombie movie, a mysterious virus has turned the population of Minneapolis into flesh-eating zombies, forcing a group of survivors to hole up at the local abandoned mall, where they are surrounded by thousands of the blood-crazed savages. Can they survive, let alone escape, with the odd so set against them?Dawn of the Dead is a fast paced, horror film that will actually scare you. It's gory, scary and a lot of fun to watch. The original film is overrated in my eyes. It was corny and dull though that's probably because it is outdated. So, the remake surpasses the original film in pretty much everything. The original had a good chance to tell a really scary story and it kind of blew it. The remake does a better job at telling the story and it adds more characters. There's more suspense and a lot more action. The zombies also run in this version. I know some people will complain that it goes against the whole point but it was a lot scarier. Watching thousands of zombies run after humans just sounds scarier and it looks scarier as well.The acting was also pretty good and convincing with the best being Ving Rhames. He can change his emotions easily and gave a really good performance. Sarah Polley also gives a good performance without going over the top. Mekhi Phifer gives an okay performance, nothing special. The rest of the cast are made up of unknowns but they all do a good job. Most of the characters are interesting to watch and you want to root for most of them to survive. It's been a while since I have actually cared about the characters in a horror film.The movie also doesn't take itself too seriously. It can be serious and scary when it wants to be. It can have a funny side as well and that keeps the film from becoming boring. There's hardly a dull moment as everything is pretty interesting. This is Zack Snyder's first movie he has directed and he should get more opportunities to direct in the future. He keeps the film tense and scary the whole time. He really does have a good eye for suspense and horror. Would you believe the guy who wrote the screenplay for the Scooby Doo movies also wrote the screenplay for this remake? He does a pretty good job and I can't wait for his next movie. This is by far the best horror film of 2004 and it's a must see for horror fans. In the end, this very bloody and entertaining remake is worth checking out. Rating 9/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Tribute to classic B film flicks.,"This movie is a pretty good tribute to the g(l)ory of old Zombie flicks. I'm no expert, but chainsaws, shotguns, gasoline fires, and stakes seem spot on. Off course, this movie did spend a lot more money than the 70' or 80' horror flicks (counting for inflation). So there is a lot more of everything.As always, I was annoyed by the sub fifties IQ level of the main characters, but that is what these movies are all about. Screaming at the screen, WHY, oh why don't you try something else? Like what I just thought about... Oh well, I guess they're not especially fit for survival.What amazes me is the utterly hostile reaction all characters meet each other with once they first meet. Is this how Americans greet each other? In a disaster area? They kind of grow and become more humane during the movie, but no reason is given for their ape like behavior in the first place. Well, it is a splatter movie, who needs character development anyway?But still, I feel there is some attempt of character development in there somewhere. It feels wrong, it is disturbing. It just fails",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than expected,"George Romero's 1978 Dawn Of The Dead is one of the best horror films ever, a grim, bloody and apocalyptic satire of consumerism, and remaking it sounded a thoroughly cynical move, so it's all the more surprising the end result is so enjoyable.The original film is essentially stripped back to its title, shopping mall location, three cameos and some in-jokes (although it still supplies all the best lines).In place of satire and shambling cadavers, director Zack Snyder goes for ironically juxtaposed songs and sprinting zombies modeled on the infected from 28 Days Later.Dawn 2003 eventually finds its own identity in a welter of meaty gore effects and one excellent escape attempt in armoured camper vans towards the end, which makes it all the more disappointing it chose to ride on the coat-tails of a giant rather than ditch the mall setting and lurch on its own two feet as the perfectly serviceable, pulse-pounding zombie frightener it is.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Zombie Action Film,"While it lacks the social commentary of the original, what it does pack is a king size action punch. This is a scare/shock fest from beginning to end and to that extent it's one of the best in years. While I do favor the original I honestly don't feel this can be considered a remake. Of the few similarities that both movies share, the shopping mall being the most obvious, they're quite actually very subtle. I understand that filming of a sequel is to begin shooting early next year. How you make a sequel to a remake is beyond me but if it's half as good as Dawn of the Dead 2004 then I shall be waiting in line at the theatre to see it. As a Zombie film collector (39 and still growing LOL), come October 5th, this film will make number 40.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dawn of the average film...,"I had insanely high hopes for this movie when I first saw the trailer a month and a half ago.  I don't know exactly what I expected, but I think I expected to much.In one of the first scenes, we see a girl skating away into the sunset, we know trouble lurks ahead.  That's fine and dandy, foresight, it's all good, but this movie ends up being so predictable in every scene to the point where it is boring.  Granted, we do get a few good surprises, but every time someone goes off alone, you know a zombie will be somewhere waiting. Every time you see a fail safe plan put in by the actors, you can almost forsee it verbatim, and that's what horror is not about.  At least not to me.  Maybe I was expecting an Evil Dead quality film.But i'm not all dissatisfied, you see.  The movie has style, humor and an overall feeling of hopelessness.  The zombies look great and the special effects aren't bad.  The actors, while convieniently labeled personality wise (or not developed at all) do a good, convincing job.  I would recommend this to a horror fan in a second.  But if your looking for the feeling that famous trailer gave you, you might want to go elsewhere.Also, Johnny Cash, and Richard Cheese, the people who put this movie together have good taste in music.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Easily the Best Horror Movie of Recent Memory,"I had wanted to see the original before I saw this remake, but when a friend asked out of the blue if I wanted to see it, I couldn't resist. I still intend to see the original, but this 2004 version was a excellent film in its own right. I didn't find it very scary, but I didn't go to be scared. The zombies were very well done, the added humour really offsets the more graphic scenes well. I found that they took your mind off the theme of the film, so when the action set back in, it would catch you off guard. The ending left me a little disapointed, but it wasn't all bad. I found that as a horror movie, it was better than most of the more recent horror films I saw,  like F vs J, and Jeepers Creepers 2. Well, only other thing I can add, is that the action scenes were great, plot was decently done ( I have  a few holes I noticed), movie was a bit rushed, but its not a big deal, and as said before, watch the end credits, it will be worth it.9/10, excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"am I nostalgic, or what?","I would say zombies don't convince me when they are so sped up and super strong. The choice of a new species of zombie (as in 28 days later) induces cool action scenes, with characters turned into real gunslingers for the occasion (the foreheads of all those poor devils seem to be strong bullet-magnets). But we loose that horrible gut feeling we can have when we see a corpse, thinking it could be us, reinforced by the fact that this corpse is a moving parody of the living. These zombies are too much alive for my taste: if they are not as brainless as they used to be, they are less repulsive. They look more like mad people to me than creepy undead. That being said, some people may think slow zombies are a bore...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
So Very Disappointing,This remake kinda reminds me of a rip off of City of The Walking Dead aka Nightmare City,1.0,Anonymous,Horror
If a remake HAD to be made- this is how to!,"Furiously paced and grittily filmed, this remake of 1978 genre classic is strikingly effective, with characters needfully restrained. The apocalyptic atmosphere is immediate and riveting. And thank you for technical film-making improvement- no tomato soup- blood, here. Still, the 1978 original haunts me differently, with its slow-moving zombies and pastel images. There the message of human wallowing in the shopping mall materialist excess also lingers longer: Once knowing you could die the next hour, wouldn't YOU be tempted to do the same thing?But hey, why compete? They're two completely different films, and equally enjoyable. But the kinetic breakout scene here is simply stunning, and the episode with Andy the rooftop gunman provides the most memorable human element. 6 out of 10 from Ozjeppe.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great zombie movie.,"After the events of Night of the Living Dead (whatever version), zombies have continued to spread across the country. There is hardly enough warning, and when the zombies suddenly strike in one city, a small group of people end up trapped inside a shopping mall while the growing numbers of the living dead swarm outside. This is a very well made zombie movie, and probably one of the best horror remakes there is.The entire concept of this movie is creepy, and the style that it's made in, with the shaky camera and fast pacing, manage to heighten the intensity of the movie. The special effects and make-up are as realistic as they could possibly get. The movie contains just the right kind of blend of action and horror, as well as throwing in a touch of comic relief here and there.The acting is extremely good for a zombie movie. When you've got good actors like Ving Rhames and Mekhi Pfeiffer in the movie, you know that there's not going to be any problems in the acting department.Overall, this isn't even a popcorn flick. It's a seriously good horror movie and a great remake.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"lots of gore, better than a lot of recent horror movies","This was pretty gory, but of course, nothing like the original. Most of the plot is the same as Romero's: a group of survivors gather in a shopping mall waiting for rescue from the walking dead. The ending was different than the original and other parts were different, such as walking underground to an adjacent building.There were plenty of chainsaws and splicing through legs. One fat lady looked beyond disgusting before she turned into a zombie. I liked the way the film was shot. A good contrast of dark and light was used and parts of the film had a campy feel to it. For example, in the middle of the film, an upbeat music plays as they put together the driving vehicles.FINAL VERDICT: Worth a viewing if you like the horror genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Instant classic,"I was not immediately thrilled at the concept of a DotD remake.  The original seemed pretty much complete in itself, and remakes are lame.Then I noticed Sarah Polley in it.  Now, for a talented actress, she has been in almost nothing south of the border since The Sweet Hereafter, and routinely turns down roles.  She simply doesn't do bad movies, and didn't here.  I found that intriguing enough to realize this was probably not a standard remake, and I bet right.And it lived up to its billing.  This movie hits the ground running and doesn't stop.  The first five minutes is perfectly paced and hits with sledgehammer force.  I knew I was in good hands when Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"" played over the opening credits.  Incidentally, I thought the opening and closing credits were comparable to another favorite set of credits, the ones in Se7en.There were only a couple direct homages to the original Romero film, one of them a setup for the shot from the poster of the original DotD movie.  I won't spoil this by naming the actor, but I think you'll see it coming. It's an intriguing twist on that moment.I won't comment on the obvious differences in the original, or the post-ironic conceit of zombies in a shopping mall in 2004.  (Zombies in a shopping mall!  Just like real life!)My gripes are very minor, and involve somewhat overdoing a few camera techniques that were also overdone in 28 Days Later.  However, one area where the film excelled was in pacing.  The violence was perfectly choreographed.  (Also, I want to marry Sarah Polley, but I'll save that subject for somewhere else.)I have seen reviews complaining of shallowness or repetitiveness, but I think such comments completely miss the point of a zombie movie, which is the existential horror of lurching sameness, and the complete lack of any moral complexity.  Zombies are simply insensate evil, and must be destroyed. The carnage does not involve human beings, nor villains, simply nonliving evil that must be destroyed.  Unlike the humans killed in a Dirty Harry movie or a war movie, zombies have no intrinsic value whatsoever.  There are no shades of gray, and no guilt in enjoying the slaughter.As such, the only way to judge a film is how it hits you in the stomach. This film had me cringing back in my seat from the first few minutes, and never let up.  I have to commend the opening, and how, like the zombies themselves, it moved fast, with a wonderful lack of stupid expository comments, explanations, or meaning.  Without hesitation, it simply jumps headfirst into the gaping maw of horror.In short, it is completely without any redeeming social value.And that is how it should be.This is an instant classic, and the crystallization of all zombie movies to date.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good zombie viewing (in more ways than one),"Okay. Maybe I've become too jaded to horror films (unlikely; I tend to jump at the same point several times in a row) but I really don't get what's so great about this movie.Point one. Fast running zombies just don't work for me. This movie should have been called Dawn of the Psychos (or Demented, if you want to stick with the alliteration theme) That could have worked; a bunch of lunatics running around trying to carve people up would probably have gotten me on the edge of my seat. To be honest, half the time I forgot these guys were supposed to be dead until I got a close up. Zombies that move slowly and seemingly unstoppably creep me out far more than ones that run around like hamsters on caffeine. To make a comparison, it's like the shower scene in Psycho; part of the reason that's so sinister is because of the slow, deliberate movements right up until the knife flashes down. If he'd rushed in, yanked the curtain off and killed her in about three seconds, it wouldn't have been nearly so nerve-racking. Same goes for here. There's nothing truly scary about a zombie that races around.Point two. The suspense for me was almost non-existent, as was the character development. Basically, people need to care about characters in order to worry about whether or not the zombies/aliens/vampires/insert bad guy here will get them. Character development here was so lax that I honestly didn't care whether or not the people lived or died. End result, almost no suspense. I think the dog got better character development overall than the humans.There were a couple of good bits; the communicating between the two groups on the rooftops was good, and the end credits sequence (watch it and you'll see what I mean) I was on the edge of my seat far more with those credits than the rest of the movie.Don't get me wrong. I liked Dawn of the Dead; it's a fun film to zombie with (pun intended ;)) I just don't get why everyone was raving about it. It's worth a watch if you like horror flicks and if you have a spare couple of hours, but don't rush to buy it.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better Than the Original!,"As good as it gets for the zombie genre with all the classic themes of inevitable doom and constant despair alleviated by the moments of hope. Excellent casting and writing combine to make this better than the already marvelous original. The mall setting still works as it did years ago: while the original veered towards social commentary of how we live mindlessly in a consumer society, this version implies that mall, represents sanctuary, a reminder for survivors of the familiar and comfortable, where people once went to socialize and relax, in a sooothing and familiar place. Of course, with zombies around, the mall now offers only a temorary respite. The tension between characters heightens the suspense. One last note: do not miss a second of the end credits; it provides a gut wrenching finale to the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fun enough.,"An exceptionally fun, zombie-slaying time. It sticks to the basic horror formula of 'Everything is fine, turmoil, everything is good again, huge problem, attempt to solve it, happy ending' but makes everything a lot more fun and gory than the average weekly gorefest. The performances are all pretty nice, notably a surprising turn from Sarah Polley into a much more mainstream environment, and no one really distracts from the story of the film. All of the gore and violent scenes are very well done and are some of the best entertainment of the decade. Attempts at a more supernatural form of horror, like the baby delivery, are poorly done and tend to take you out of the thrill of the rest of the film but they are few and far in between. It gets a bit dull at time, but as always, the final act is exhilarating and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The finale is bittersweet and a perfect end to the picture.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very good remake of my all-time favorite film  (***1/2),"There's no other way to start this review than to state that George A. Romero's original, 1978 masterpiece ""Dawn Of The Dead"", about 4 survivors of a zombie plague setting up house in an empty shopping mall, is my favorite movie of all time. I remember the first time I saw it like it was yesterday.A lot of the other fans of the original were upset at the idea of this remake, but I was excited. I'm not a purist, so as long as the makers paid respect to the original and made a good-enough movie that wasn't TOO stupid, I'd be happy. Well, I couldn't be happier to tell you that unlike the lame botch-job that was the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake, this ""Dawn..."" remake met my expectations...and then some.Technically, it's not being called a ""remake"" but rather a ""re-envisioning"", because the characters and sequence of events are quite different. I didn't mind this, because it's far more interesting to see a reworking of a theme than an exact remake, and there is lots of interesting ground left to cover in Romero's brilliantly imagined post-apocalyptic society.After the unexplained plague hits and proceeds to turn all of society upside down within a matter of hours, a few survivors, which include a nurse (great indie actress Sarah Polley), a cop (Ving Rhames), and a young man (Mekhi Phifer) with his very pregnant Russian girlfriend (Inna Korobkina), head to the local mall looking for shelter.Once they lock the entrances and it's clear that no help is coming, they proceed for a while to build a new life in the shopping mall. It's a fascinating concept, building an insulated, miniature utopian society inside this giant mall, while just outside, the whole world is crumbling.The problem, though, is that there are far too many characters in this one. In the original, there were only four, and as a result they were each extremely well developed. Here, there's at least 15 people in the mall, and many of them seem to be just filling space.Though it's true that Romero's smart social commentary takes a backseat here to hard-driving action scenes, this is still a very tough and intelligent film. A few other critics and I picked up on an eerie, distinctly post-9/11 vibe, the idea of living in a burned-out, post-apocalyptic America (an American flag makes an ironic appearance near the end). Hmm, maybe the zombies are George W. Bush's followers?Ultimately, writer James Gunn and director Zack Snyder have gone out of their way to make a really fine film here, and it shows. They don't stray far from Romero's vision or dumb-down the material, they retained much of his dark humor, they assembled a quality cast, and included several clever cameos and in-jokes for those of us familiar with the original.So it's not Romero, but it's still a hell of a good time.And be sure not to arrive late. The first 10 minutes of this film (which includes what is bar none the best opening credits sequence I've seen in years), make for a powerful experience all their own.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great fun but no classic,"Let's face it. I didn't want this movie to be made. I felt like kicking someone's dog when it was announced. How could the studios give first-timer Zack Snyder money to remake George Romero's classic, yet not give Georgie a couple of bucks to finish off his own series? I didn't watch this at the movies, even though I love James Gunn. It finally came out in its 'uncut' form on DVD and.... it was pretty cool. Some of the ideas were well executed (if unoriginal), Ving Rhames turned in a spirited performance and no, my copy of the original didn't mysteriously disappear after seeing this newer version.The pace of the film was tight, the makeup was brilliant and I had a helluva time sitting through it. But afterwards...nothing. What I had seen was much like the popcorn I munched throughout, tasty but not exactly nutritious. Romero's original trilogy was like sitting down to a kilo steak, potatoes, chips and a fine glass of wine. You felt satisfied. Dawn of the Dead 2004 was so full of quick cuts, bloodless killings, CGI and paper thin characters that a week later, I could remember little about the movie other than a few key plot points and ""hey...that's cool"" moments.These feelings were only heightened when I watched DotD '04 a couple of days after Romero's Land of the Dead, a film that managed to pack in as many hip, exciting scenarios whilst offering deep characters and and a thoughtful storyline. And you actually got to see the zombies. Snyder did great, but he couldn't get close to Romero.But enough about Romero. Snyder's created an above-average horror flick that's a great way to pass a couple of hours. There's enough action in there to please even the fussiest of fans, some truly eerie imagery and is a fantastic addition to the genre. You just might have to grab a burger on the way home.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Wow...,"I had a great rush seeing this film. It was creepy, funny and i really loved the zombie's! Very, very exciting! I didn't see the original, so it was a big surprise for me. I first saw the trailer, which made me very curious. So i just saw it and had a blast. The film immediately begins, after a small intro. I like that. Most films try to explain way to much about causes and all. Dawn of the Dead did not do that; Great!TEASER: It's a shame that the killings of the main characters are so predictable. The ones we meet (and like) in the beginning of the film all stick together... I wish there could be at least one or two surprises. Liked the chainsaw by the way... :)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
REMAKES RULE GENRE TERRITORY!,"I have to tell you after watching the stupid teaser for this film my expectations weren't very high. And although the trailer kicked major ass I still had doubts on wheather it would even be a mediocre film, it didn't have much going for it. A brand new commerical director, a big studio, a remake of a (in my opinion) passable flaky classic.  And even after meeting the cast at the Fango Convention in January, I got a little amped to see it but still had my doubts. All of those doubts have been put to rest today. Following the same logic as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake this is more of a reimagining borrowing the basic ideas and updating for our times. Dawn of the Dead isn't just a good film, it's a great one. And a landmark genre picture at that. It follows the basic setup of the strangers meeting at a local mall, where they fend off hordes of zombies while trying to indulge themselves in an acceptable lifestyle. Only for the horrors of the world surrounding them to come crashing in. And boy do they do. The film boasts some of the most imaginative death sequences seen in a while and captures the overall dread and horror brought forth by the source material. Unlike it's simplistic and over hyped predecessor this film remains entertaining while staying respectful, clever and scary. It also helps that the film is fueled by taut direction, good performances especially from new horror heroine Sarah Polley and believable charachter growth and story development. The effects are also over the top, grotesque and very creative.  However the only way the film falls short is in the way that it doesn't match Chainsaw's story telling or overall intensity. But this film is definatly a new horror classic, the new generation can embrace and the old genration can treasure. One thats respectful to a genre fan's needs and yet can overcome critical stabs and remain succesful. Dawn of the Dead is just another example of how Remakes are beginning to rule genre territory and new flicks are just seemingly falling flat. Their are many reasons to cherish this film cinematograoghy, hilarious soundtrack choices, an intensly scary tone, great spfx, good story, believable performances, expert direction but the one main reason to go see it is that it's worth your money.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Can't kill an original,"I saw Dawn of the Dead years ago at a sleep over and I thought it was the greatest zombie flick of all time. This is the movie that got me interested into the horror genre even more than I was. I have seen so many other zombie flicks and not one came close to Dawn of the Dead. Night of the Living Dead and Return of the Living Dead were good and Demons 1 and 2 were pretty awesome, but nothing ever came close to Dawn of the Dead. When I heard about the remake I was exstatic! I was so excited and I couldn't wait. When I finally saw the remake this past weekend it was good but not nearly great like the original. I did not expect too much because of nowadays horror movies but I expected it to be a little better than it was. I thought it was enterataining enough to keep me in my seat but I am not willing to see it again. Fans will be dissapointed because of how much is missing. I would also like to know something else.

Instant classic,"I just got back from this.It absolutely rocked.  I think it is the best zombie movie of all time, including the original Dawn of the Dead, although the pace was closer to Cameron than Romero.I was leery of the general idea of a remake of the Romero classic, until I noticed Sarah Polley was in it.  She simply doesn't do bad movies, so her presence promised something more than just a derivative schlockfest.It masterfully combines the rollercoaster Hollywood film with the sheer creepiness of the original.  It also has enough of the light touch of the original to offset the horror enough to be just barely tolerable.Additionally, the zombie makeup manages to be campy and silly and terrifying at the same time.  This is a good trick.This kind of movie has to be judged with the gut, and I found myself cringing in my seat more than once.  It had a lot of similarities to 28 Days Later, but was just plain better, without the pacing problems of the last half of 28 Days.The first ten minutes are superbly paced, and the situation develops with a near total lack of the stupid exposition or explanation that usually interrupts the carnage long enough to be annoying in a disaster movie. The total collapse of society is so quick that it mercifully leaves little time for stupid talking heads.  The movie dives headfirst into the absolute horror of the situation without sentimentality.This also has the best opening credits I have seen since Se7en, with ""When the Man Comes Around"" by Johnny Cash setting the tone for the rest of the movie.The movie is packed with scenes so rattling that the rare calm scene where little is happening is completely nerve-racking.  I still have an adrenaline rush.Anyway, if you like zombie movies, this is, in my opinion, the ultimate one.  I liked the original, but this one takes the original and kicks its ass.  My only (slight) gripe is the overuse near the end of faux-clumsy handheld-style tracking shots, but I can live with it.  The scenes in question are still paced perfectly.  I also don't have any better idea for how they could have done it.  Obviously vanilla smooth Steadicam or dolly shots would have been completely out of the question.The best single performance in the film is Matt (Max Headroom) Frewer's, as a doomed zombie bite victim.  This scene includes one of the few direct Romero allusions, specifically the shot used on the most commonly seen poster for the 1978 classic.Another great thing about this film is it is the perfect film to knock Mel Gibson out of the #1 spot.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
surprising,"i have yet to see the original, so i don't have anything to compare it to, so this is probably going to change. i hate movies, where characters are stupid, like going back to check on her husband, even though its obvious he's the living dead. however it was fun being a smartass and yelling at the screen littering the dialogue with sarcasm and cynicism. i was exceptionally pleased with the slow version of ""get down with the sickness"" and ving rhames was surprisingly strong. The pregnant lady and baby thing was pretty nasty, but i can see how this could become a cult classic very quickly. i am sure that some die hard fans of the original will call this crap, but we need remakes to give the newer generations a hint at what they missed, and what it took to get us here in today's cinema",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Same plot as the 1st one, but different ending, and much better special effects/make-up than way back in the olden days of the first. Also, Ving Rhames is nothing' to sneeze at, either, and pulls off a great 'bruiser with a heart of gold' act.

not my genre,"i tend to shy away from horror movies. i have for years. it's not that i'm scared or that i object to violence and gore or anything quite so quaint as that. my problem with horror movies has been (and is likely to remain ever so) the intelligence, or more to the point lack thereof on the part of the characters. to me a movie has to have characters that behave in (mostly) rational way. characters have to have intelligence or it feels like porn for it's plot. generally horror movies tend towards characters that lack any fiber of what could be called intelligence, they make mistakes no clear thinking human being is likely make and tend to compound their mistakes when given an opportunity. it is this behavior of characters that generally lead to horror movie fans that talk to the screen, dictate to the movie, et cetera, et cetera. I liked Dawn Of The Dead because it avoided this fairly well at times. But during a few scenes the irrational stupidity of characters shone through. In fact one of the best examples of any horror movie stupidity presented itself when the character Steve (alone and in the dark as usual) puts down a perfectly good weapon (a crowbar) and picks up a lesser weapon, a croquet mallet. A nearly unbreakable heavy metal bar or a fabricated piece of cheap wood, what sane person in dire circumstances would prefer the later to the former? Perhaps, yes, i am over thinking the movie here (instead of sitting back and immersing myself) but this type of stupidity leaves me feeling as though i am the fool for wasting my money.low 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Okay, but was it needed?","George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead is a classic horror movie that really didn't need to be retold...but that's exactly what director Zack Snyder has done so I guess I should review it after having seen it twice. I admit there have been far worse remakes, but I can't help but sense how unnecessary this was especially since these two films are worlds apart in many ways. They don't really remake Dawn of the Dead so much as they re-use some elements from the original script and slap the title ""Dawn of the Dead"" on it to get attention.In the original film George A. Romero had used the setting of a mall to make satire of human nature. In the Snyder film everything has been refit for zombie action. George A. Romero used the stumbling zombies from his 'Night of the Living Dead'. Zach Snyder uses the Olympic Sprinter Zombies from '28 Days Later'. Romero knew how to spread his movie out with a casual pace. Snyder in the vain of all modern action movies uses quick cuts and generally seems to have everything moving as fast as it can giving no time for character development other that easily recognizable stereotypes.I think its clear that I prefer the original...But I don't think this is remake is bad. Its just another zombie movie is all. Nothing really special, nothing really bad about it. It doesn't stand up to films like those of George A. Romero or 28 Days Later, but it is better than things like Resident Evil.So, this new Dawn of the Dead is quite a bit of gore-filled fun, but as a whole is flat and uninteresting compared to the 1978 original.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great remake,"As a fan of the original Romero films and the genre in general, I was somewhat apprehensive to see what this film would do with the material. Fortunately, the result was an onslaught of gore, awesome looking modern-day `fast' zombies, well honed homage to the past, and snippets of originality from the writer/director that make this a truly excellent addition to the zombie film collection!  While House of the Dead (last year) had its good moments (and its bad as well), Dawn exhibited quality filmmaking all the way through.  I really enjoyed the energy, visual effects (gore) and cinematography, and the characters in this movie.  So many horror movies these days forget that characters are as important as the rest of the action.  Not here.  If you are a zombie fan, and you enjoyed 28 Days and/or the original Living Dead movies, you really should see this movie on the big screen.  There are some really great suspense sconces that we could never have imagined back in the 1970s.   Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing great,Well I gotta admit I was rather excited to watch this movie a few days ago. The reviews on the film were good and some hype like those for The Ring were present.

I gotta admit I was not that impressed with the film. I thought story line was a little to ordinary and didn't seem too original. Some of the events just didn't feel right. Some of the other elements they tried to inject such as drama when they had to kill one of the bitten humans and the comedy just didn't feel right.I thought the effects were good enough.

Beginning with TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE back in October, and now with DAWN OF THE DEAD, many can only imagine what other concepts are being thought up.However, if any future remake has the stamina that this remake has, then the horror genre may revive itself.  DAWN OF THE DEAD is in no sense a breakthrough movie with an inventive plot.  Actually we never learn of the reason zombies exist in the first place (it is a remake of the follow up of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, where the plot is revealed).  But it is the excitement and relentlessness that this film brings about it.From the fun and intense opening to the finale (which is a little predictable, I should add I have never seen the original all the way through), there is always something going on.The actors in this film, while several of them have names (particularly Ving Rhames and Mekhi Pheifer), are all decent in the parts they play.  They each offer something different to the movie.The message of consumerism that spawned from the first one is still used here, but not does not remain a main focus.For having a great sense of style, some intense scenes, and overall fun DAWN OF THE DEAD (2004) rates as a  6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Loved the film. soundtrack?,"First, i'd like to say i (a 35 yr. old zombie freak), and my non zombie loving friends thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was far better than i hoped it would have been. The acting, cinematography, editing, humor and horror were all top notch. The opening 10 minutes is a master-stoke in horror story telling and makes this film worthy of the series by itself.  And I'm  glad they kept the series fatalism intact at end. i was skeptical of fast zombies as i did not like them in 28 days, but here i did.anyways, i loved the music used in movie, and i cant find a sound track CD for this film online. does anyone know who the artist and songs which were in DOD?",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Great Remake?,"Dawn of The Dead 2004Director:Zack SnyderStarring:Sarah Polley,Ving Rhames,Jake WeberThe original dawn of the Dead will always be the definite zombie movie and nothing will ever beat it but the remake is still pretty darn good. Instead of wasting all the time developing characters this movie is wall to wall action.which is no bad thing because the movie is perfectly paced and has a different feel than the original. You probably wont be learning the characters names but you will still get the jist of whats going on.One complaint i have is that i just didn't like the feel of the mall maybe because it wasn't explored but the originals mall just cant be beat. The Movie is more a re-imagining taking the basic survivors stuck in a mall idea and the similarities stop there. The story wont do anything for most but the pace and action will make up for it,while the acting is all pretty good apart from the red haired girl who loses her father,her performance was laughable.all in all a really enjoyable action flick!!!!3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
EXCELLENT,"hi, this is my first comment so i hope it is a good and memorable one Dawn Of The Dead 2004 is an excellent remake of the original, i am as much a fan of the original then anyone on the planet, i have all versions of the original on DVD and VHS and was blown away by the 04 version, it was a kick a**! film , scary, action packed, and i found very exciting. the original is one if not great all time classics(in my opion) and this 2004 version may be up there, i certainly enjoyed it more than LOTR: Return Of The King, in the 2004 version, i found the acting better than the original the special effects were outstanding( if anyone says that that isn't hard 'cos it was done in the seventies on a low budget and wouldn't stand the test of time) i challenge them to look at zombie flesh eaters(the 1st one Note: i can not stand zombie flesh eaters but i have to say the effects in that one was and is still very excellent and have stood up against time) 2004 may have lacked the underlined commerical issue that the original had layered through out re: consumerism, but had its own for what i saw in which i thought was underlined in the 04 version was the fact that std's have ravaged every corner of the globe, not a bad issue to have hidden in you films, but on a whole it gave the original a big kick up the a**! this one will be a classic to come remember the original took along time to get a cult status then to go on to be considered a classic in the modern day horror genre i hope Dawn of the Dead 2004 does well enough to go on and remake Day of the Dead and Night Of the Living Dead and make it a new trilogy in that order i for one will be watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mall Mayhem with Mixed Results,"I finally got around to watching this film, and while it has some good moments, I have to admit it didn't quite live up to the hype for me. There's no denying that the film kicks off with a bang-the opening scenes are intense and do a great job of setting the tone for the chaos to come. The early moments are filled with suspense, and I found myself genuinely invested in the characters as they try to navigate this terrifying new world.One of the film's strengths is its setting. The idea of survivors holing up in a shopping mall is both clever and loaded with potential. The mall provides a unique backdrop that offers some interesting opportunities for action and character development. And to be fair, the film does make good use of its environment, creating some memorable sequences that keep the tension high. The makeup and special effects are also impressive, with the zombies looking suitably grotesque and menacing.However, as the film goes on, it starts to lose its grip a bit. Once the survivors settle into the mall, the story begins to drag, and the initial tension starts to fade. The middle act feels a bit bloated, with too many scenes that don't really move the plot forward. I also found some of the character choices a little baffling and frustrating. While I understand that panic and fear can make people act irrationally, there were moments where the characters' decisions seemed more about serving the plot than staying true to their personalities.Another issue I had was with the tone. The film tries to balance horror and humor, but it doesn't always succeed. There are a few moments that feel unintentionally funny, which undercuts the horror. And while the social commentary about consumerism is interesting, it feels a bit heavy-handed at times. I appreciate the attempt to add some depth to the story, but it often comes across as more preachy than profound.Overall, the film has its moments, especially in the first act, and the concept is strong. But it struggles to maintain the same level of intensity and engagement throughout. It's not a bad watch if you're in the mood for some zombie mayhem, but don't expect anything too groundbreaking or consistently thrilling. It's a decent ride that's fun in parts, but it didn't quite hit the mark for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dawn of the death of horror,"I loved the acting - very believable, almost like a school play.I really cared for the characters in this movie, I mean, you have to feel for them for this is most likely the end of the actors' careers if they ever had one.I was stunned by the make up effect, I want the same set of crayons for my kids, they would kill at their primary. It felt good to be stunned, sit in a stupor and miss most of the 'action', like REALLY good. I felt like one of those 'zombies' I guess, I'm sure they were stupefied at how this epic turned out.Multilayered like a nappy, deep like bubbling intestines, fermenting and ready to launch. A few moments at the very very beginning showed promise but after 5 minutes it's been diarrhoea all the way to the end. And no-one had the courage to wipe afterwards.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Disgustingly awful,"God knows what was on the mind of the director when he thought of making this film. This movie SUCKS!!!No imagination, no plot, cant say the same for the makeup thoughIf you got nothing else to do in life and have 2 hours to waste, do not still watch this movie. Make one of your own and I promise i can watch that.Nothing seems to happen in the whole movie. Dead people keep running after a couple of alive men and they keep closing doors on their faces after shooting a few. Each character is a dare devil, a born shooter and minus all sanity.Can somebody please give me a reason for rating this movie so highly.",,Anonymous,Horror
"Resident Evil, eat your heart out","I'm not normally a big horror fan, as a majority of the ""horrors"" that I've seen have, at best, only one good jump-inducing scene, with a few cheap obligatory ""shock"" moments that rely more on surprise than horror to scare you.Dawn of the Dead is intense. Really intense. Intense intense intense... the pacing of the action beautifully creates the feeling that everyone is just hanging on for their lives, and breaks are few and far between. About mid-way through the action slacks for about 10 minutes, and I felt myself welcoming the mental break almost as much as the characters themselves.This is a fun movie... make sure to see it with a group of friends, and don't get up to go to the restroom. And unlike most other zombie movies, the zombies are actually pretty scary... I've heard a few complain about the idea of a fast zombie, but the slow, shambling zombies of resident evil look absolutely lame in comparison to these fast, screaming unfortunates.This is horror at it's purest- the crap's been cut, the action is inense, and nothing is sacred.

Best horror movie in a decade?,"I was aware that I might be disappointed with Snyder's movie, but I have to say that it really surprised and shocked me. The energy of the movie is quite extreme as is the action. It is a miracle how this major passed German censorship, they are usually quite fast to turn down violence, but none of it here. I liked everything about this movie, especially the movie's credits and the fast running zombies, or the ending. I think the gory content is extreme for a major movie. Will watch this one at least once more.A big Hello and thanks a lot to Mr Snyder from me and all of my friends!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
a new horror classic,"Romero's original Dawn of the dead is without question one of the best horror films ever made, as is the Original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". With the re-make of that last film in mind, one could have very easily disregarded the remake of Dawn. But within minutes in Dawn's re-make you know you are in for a much more original film than Texas re-make.Dawn starts with Johnny Cash's ""The Man Comes Around"", how is that for an introduction, and what follows is just as good. The story floats around fluently, and just as in the original, much comment is given on today's society. This could easily have become an over-producted-special effects-gore fest, but instead, most scary moments are just brilliant editing and directing,as was the original. The difference between Dawn's re-make and Texas re-make is that both the original films had good story lines,a terrific premise,and were much better production than most horror films. The producers and director of the new Dead, have staid very close to the good elements of the original and have put in some new ingredients. Texas re-make kept only the premise and became, well a film massacre. This new Dawn of the Dead is one of the best horror films of recent years, and should give the director much recognition as was given to Romero after his first Dead film. Scary as hell, well made, good performances, excellent camera and editing makes Dawn of the Dead a must see film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
good movie poorly performed.,"This is a remake of the classic dawn of the dead and it does not a bad job of living up to the original. The story sticks close to the same but there is some things that botherd me. The acting is terrible by everyone except maybe one of the cast and the zombies run....which everyone knows is impossible. Other then that though its not bad, the action scenes are intense and gory for the zombie lover fan.This movie is about a woman who in the middle of the night is attacked by a little girl with some kind of disease. The girl bites he husband and gives him the disease which turns him into a flesh eating monster. She runs from him and ends up with a group of people who decide to go to the mall to try to survive agaisnt the hoards of the undead.This movie was pretty good besides the acting of course. The story line was good and there were some nice twists and turns. Quite entertaining with lots of zombie killing",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
You gotta see this one !!!,"I wasn't sure if whether the original could be outdone or not. I am happy to say that this remake was totally AWESOME. The acting was great,the special effects were great and overall,I was very impressed. I am hoping that there may be a sequel to this once that all is said and done. The ending did place a little doubt in ones' mind as to what the outcome was. The updated version of how the zombies moved and carried themselves was definitely needed. The fact that the zombies moved as fast as a normal person made it even more exciting and convincing. I guarantee you that if you take it upon yourself to go and see this movie,you definitely will not be disappointed. I took a friend with me to see it who really isn't into horror flicks and science fiction,but he left the movie theater totally satisfied. He said that he couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better Then I Initially Thought (Possible Spoilers)!,"When I first saw this movie, I thought it was enjoyable and entertaining, but that it only existed on a superficial level. I believed the sole purpose of this film was to provide an action-packed reformation of the original Dawn of the Dead. Being that I had been a fan of Romero's a year prior to the release of this film, I had the notion that remaking Romero's vision would be hard, if not impossible. Although nothing will equate to the original Dawn of the Dead, this film is not that bad at all. It's just an alternate outlook on a classic zombie film.Zack Snyder's envisioning of such a classic concept prevails. The visuals of this film are stunning. Snyder knew the vision he was trying to create and it simply worked. The film closely follows the theologies of the end times and the Rapture; it achieves a sort of apocalyptical vision. Except instead of Satan, the Anti-Christ and demons... you have zombies. Everyone is trying to protect themselves and their homestead, some with brute force, and they are just trying to cope with this sort of ""Hell on Earth."" This film really does excel visually and retains a sort of nightmarish quality to it.And one aspect of the film I particularly like is the transformation and the stages of the zombies. In the bonus features to this film, Zack Snyder tells us that he created different stages and levels of the ""zombie infection."" I found this idea to be very creative and unique.Good film: 7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very disapointing...,"This film is no where near as good as the original. The slow sense of creeping dread has been replaced by frantic MTV style action. The only thing they kept from the original is a mall and zombies, and even the zombies are completely different.And whereas its a remake of the original Dawn..., it's a complete rip-off of ""28 days later"" stylistically, the look and movement of the zombies and the grainy, gritty camera work.Not to say its all bad. The opening sequence is terrific, (especially the realization of the widespread destruction). Other than that, there's really nothing to promote about the rest.Stick to the original Dawn... and 28 days later.",,Anonymous,Horror
Dawn of the Dead (2004) 6/10,"As a stand-alone zombie movie, Dawn of the Dead is an action packed nail biter after an initial watch. However, after consideration, there are massive plot holes and characters making the wrong choices throughout the film. At one point, all the characters were in a gun shop with zombies surrounding them and then all of a sudden, a terrible cut, and they all end up in the sewers. How does that happen? The girl going on a suicide mission for a dog was incredibly dumbfounding too. The ""Dawn of the Dead"" remake is widely entertaining and worth a rent or look on television but it fails in a lot of potentially credible spots.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good action flick with (running) zombies as a backdrop,"I remember I was a bit disappointed when I eventually watched the original Zombie (European DVD so I guess it was Dario Argento's cut) whereas I am a big fan of the original Night of the Living Dead. I did not find that Romero clearly improved on his sharp and raw pristine effort, especially the political outlook did not strike me as really powerful.So I was looking forward to watching Dawn of the Dead which was successful back in 2004, both financially speaking and in bringing the zombie-genre directly from the brainless Z-genre into the brain-damaged mainstream. And I was not disappointed because the movie is very well done and mostly delivers the right amount of action with the good rhythm.Now I think it could have been way better given the fact that there was room for improvement on Zombie. I always felt that what was most efficiently done in Night of the Living Dead was the claustrophobic effect of a group of survivors up assaulted by countless relentless soulless humanoids. John Carpenter later also achieved this with his own low-budget Assault on Precinct 13 so, basically the zombie backdrop is secondary, it is just a (costly) macguffin since nobody really cares about the actual rationale behind the uprising.I cannot fault Dawn of the Dead for 'just' being an effective survival action movie with a global zombie premise. It is just a shame the tension between survivors only peaks between lulls where they are mostly sitting around. For instance I did not find the initial opposition between the mall security team and the initial group played out well. Sadly it did not amount to much and the tension recedes until they actually decide they are not just going to wait forever.Action does have the advantage of ironing out inconsistencies. I already mentioned claustrophobia as a sadly overlooked element here. An example is that the survivors should have shown real signs of psychological imbalance (due to increasing paranoia) when they eventually decide to break out. Unfortunately the group mostly looks pretty sane with characters who do act like they just bide their time.--Ok, I am done with analysing the core shortcomings behind the effective action flick, now I conclude by mentioning some excellent and poor creative choices.The prologue is really excellent, although it sets your expectations high in the zombie genre.The credits (beginning and end) are too much on the splashy gore zombie Z-exploitation side: this really is a distracting nod to a sub-genre that should not be a reference to any ambitious film-maker.The initial group gathering is actually the first lull and is also a lost opportunity to better establish the new characters. It is mostly weak as you would expect in some basic B-movie.Andy is a fine addition although it is wasted, dragged for too long before someone has a reality call (Andy himself should have anticipated that he could not live for long on his ammo).The couple expecting a baby gives one of the best scenes but it is somewhat lost in the middle instead of being a major subplot on a collision course with the main survival arc.Running zombies. Oh yes, the choice is debatable and definitely tunes the movie towards all-out action. I remember some found the original Romero zombies to be laughable, but basically people who are afraid of watching an horror flick alone at night with all the lights off will brag that they found all horror flicks only worth a good laugh (hence the subgenre). Zach Snyder explained he needed to not have static zombies in a shot or they would just look like actors with heavy makeup. Well... once again someone forgot about the 'Cat people' lesson retold by Kirk Douglas in Vincente Minnelli's The Bad and the Beautiful: simply put shadows and indistinct sihouettes are indeed much more powerful than anything the best costume designer + makeup artist can ever achieve.All these little flaws add up and the ending is not very convincing: a lack of claustrophobic tension again while the feeling is more akin to an hyper-motivated macho paratroopers pack jumping to their drop zone than traumatized civilians roaming forward for their lives in the unknown.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
an effective re-imagining...,"I attended a preview screening last night and as a die-hard fan of the original I can honestly say that this movie (for the most part) kicked serious ass.It did a great job of forging the basic elements of the the original into something suitable for a modern audience without cheapening it. Great gore and action setpieces, great performances, great moments (the mid-film musical montage in particular is fucking priceless) and a very well executed ending.As with any modern horror film there are a few logical ""what the fu**?"" moments and I do wish the movie had taken more time to develop the sub-plot involving Mekhi Phifer's character and his wife but overall the movie accomplishes what it sets out to do in spades. Any zombie fan with an open mind shouldn't find too much to complain about. Can't wait for the uncut/unrated version DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Zombie Movie,"I love it when people expand on original ideas in an original way. The original was a horror but it also gave the audience a zombie universe and there's plenty of stories to tell there.Well, there were. Most of them have been ran into the ground, much like superhero movies.It's still great to hop back in time and rewatch a movie like this. The only frustrating thing about zombie movies, especially watching them after their prime, is that the people in them don't know they're in a zombie movie. That means idiots making infuriatingly stupid decisions that get other people killed. There's no shortage of that in Dawn of the Dead and they usually get their due before the movies ends.This movie had a nice balance of both. Stupid, selfish, delusional and capable people, all ending up together by accident and making the best of it.The fact that both Snyder and Gunn had their fingers in this, long before they became ""big"" is both a happy and a sad tiding. Happy because we got to enjoy something they made while their creativity was still flourishing.... before they both took a tumble down ego drive. That would be the sad part.It's 2025 now, zombies are yesterday's fad and rightfully so. We've seen it all at this point. 28 years later will attempt to ride the coattails of one of the better franchises in the genre but it's unlikely it'll reinvigorate it.No matter, we'll always have the good ones to fall back to every now and then... and this is one of them.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Coming Dawn,"I went into this thinking it was gonna suck. I love the original Dawn of the Dead, and I thought that having James Gunn (of Scooby Doo fame) writing it was going to ensure its place in the bad remakes of history... Right next to the Psycho remake. I mean, when you have a great piece of material, why remake it? Only remake movies that stunk in the first place. Don't remake the classics. That was my attitude. But this movie surprised me. The filmmakers successfully took George Romero's dystopic view of modern society and reinvented it for a new generation. My main question is, did this really need to be a remake? I mean, clearly it shared some things conceptually with Romero's (like the mall, and some of the moments) but this also felt like a pretty complete reboot. I wonder if they could have created this movie as a stand alone zombie flick? Perhaps there is value in the title ""Dawn of the Dead"". Who knows what drives those studio execs? In the end, this was a successful, fun zombie movie. The characters were a little flat and some of the action was predictable, but the overall effect was good enough for me to give this movie 7 out of 10 stars. Teamed with ""28 Days Later"", I think these two films have brought about a nice zombie rebirth. Unfortunately, that also gives you the B versions like ""Corpses are Forever"" and ""Bloody Bill"", but I still think a resurgence of the zombie genre is a good thing.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

An okay remake,"The first ""Dawn of the Dead"" isn't exactly my favorite of the Romero zombie films but I still think it's slightly better than this remake. I remember watching this in theaters and finding it a bit on the just okay side. The home release didn't change my mind. It's serviceable as both a zombie film and a remake but don't go in expecting it to be a horror movie. Outside of the zombies, this film is firmly an action movie with little horror elements. It's fine to watch if you're the type that's okay with gore and not a big fan of horror. The characters are just okay and often make rather dumb decisions. While it hits similar beats as the original, it's definitely not quite the same.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Retraction!,"Maybe my last review was a tad hasty.I had previously posted an earlier (harsher) comment based on the theatrical release the day before the DVD's U.S. debut. Should have waited just a couple more days.After viewing the 'Unrated Director's Edition' with my wife and son (neither had seen it), it came down to this: This was much, much more enjoyable the 2nd time round. Just because this didn't scare me, doesn't mean that this movie isn't scary. I had just as much fun (maybe I'm sick!) watching out of the corner of my eye, my wife and son ""yip"", jump and cringe behind their couch pillows during the shocking scenes; as much as I did re-watching the flick itself. Or maybe cuz it was late Saturday night; the night before Halloween! Dying (no pun intended) for something to watch that would be kinda scary (at least for them). Something scary on a global crisis level! And guess what? For them...the scares delivered; Yep-per-ree!!...them scares delivered Big Time!The 'Unrated...' clears up a few more plot holes (like ahh! how they got into the mall by breaking a store window without being followed??) and establishes a little more character opportunities. It did seem better acted the 2nd time around. Fact is, it was just some 'actor spottiness' by a couple of the supporting players that colored my original perceptions. And if Jake Weber doesn't get more acting jobs after this, he needs to fire his agent. The guy's got great voice inflection!On a hunch, I bought the 'Unrated'...dvd during it's 1st week, while still on sale discount. Because I very much wanted to like this movie, in spite of how disappointing it seemed the 1st time seeing it. Besides, it was Halloween weekend. You know everyone enjoys a good, scary Halloween fright flick during Halloween time...Right?? Hey; doesn't most everybody??? Well...good decision!Is it as good or better than the original? Not quite!...but that's an opinion. A few too many scenes where thrills take precedent over logic (try exploding a propane tank so close to a fueled powered bus). There's no denying that many vintages surpass the original. And some nice departures on its own. A 1st time director??...there's worse out there from seasoned veterans.(Secret for uping the scare scale!: Ya just gotta know when to discreetly crank up the volume during the shocking, graphic moments...it helps.)",,Anonymous,Horror
"Good, yet not good enough","Being a faithful follower of George Romero's Dead trilogy (Night, Dawn, and Day), I was somewhat satisfied with the remake of Dawn of the Dead. It has great action!!!! However, it lacks in some areas. There are too many characters, thus leading to a lack of character depth. The running zombies just didn't cut it for me as it reminded us of the ghouls in 28 days later (i.e., seemed like a sequel to 28 days later at times). Finally, if the dead are returning to life, then why is it only those who have been bitten?!?!?!? Those shot or dying of natural causes do not re-animate!!!! That's a major difference from the trilogy and Romero's concept. MAJOR FLAW in my opinion. On the other hand, the action is great and does an amazing job at causing tension and anxiety in moviegoers (I think I checked every room in the apartment when I got home). Also, the story line is good enough to maintain one's attention. I suggest loyal and new fans go see the remake, all will enjoy!!!!

Apocalyptic delight,"I absolutely love movies about the apocalypse. I'm sorry, but I find it absolutely romantic to watch movies about the end of the world. Yeah, I know I am crazy, but it is my weird fetish. This movie did not disappoint. The first 20 minutes of this movie was absolutely horrifying. I could literally feel my blood pressure and my heart rate climb to fear induced levels. Yes, I was actually scared, and my body was responding to it. It is crazy to be attacked by someone you love. In this movie her own husband and a trusted girl attack the main character Sara. I loved it when she ran out of her house to escape to see the whole city in chaos. Her neighbor was pointing a gun at her, and all the houses were on fire. Her neighbors were being slaughtered right in front of her. It made the hair on my neck stand up! The first 20 minutes of the move had me hooked. She escapes the situation and gets together with survivors at the local mall. Unfortunately the rest of the movie was situated in the mall. I would have preferred a movie where the characters were continuously on the run, (similar to 28 Days). The mall scenes were mildly scary, but the situation was different in the mall. The mall gave the characters a sense of security that lessened the fear of the situation. The mall kept the ""living dead"" out, and it gave the characters a security that actually made me relax. I would have like them to be put in uncomfortable situations throughout the movie. I felt that they were given too much control. The mall was a barrier between the living and the dead, and I feel that the barrier should have been blurred. Beyond my negativity, I still feel that this movie was an above average horror movie. I wish I had monitors hooked up to me during this movie. There were certain scenes that would have caused the monitors to go off in ""code blue"" mode. I can say that I was scared at moments, and I feel that a movie has succeeded if it can cause emotion such as panic.I would like to add I was the only person that stayed in the theater to see the end credits. The end credits showed what happened when the boat reached the island. Freaking' Awesome ending! It was the most exciting end credits I have seen in a movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Great Remake,"I saw 'Dawn of the Dead' this afternoon and whilst it is not a patch on George Romero's classic, Zack Snyder's film is a rollicking action flick with a brilliant third act and a great cast, though there are way too many characters in it, Sarah Polley, Jake Weber and Ving Rhames were great and the actor who played C.J. was cool too, extra credit goes to the dog Chips for his wonderful and daring mission through the sea of zombies towards the end, that dog ruled.  The CGI is a bit ropey and the story moves far too rapidly, the controversial decision to make the zombies fast and athletic works better than in '28 Days Later' but there was not enough gore for me, the cannibalistic element was not played up like in the original.  A great effort though, I hope the same director makes a sequel to the film. Zombie's rule and with intelligent scripts and cool action sequences, they could have a whole new era of zombie movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Such a startling horror... it will eat you alive!,"I enjoyed this horror immensely but the ending of this movie is just like almost all other horror movies, I hate to ruin it for you but no body makes it!I hate it when people say Hollywood ending i.e. when the central characters make it at the end! As if this counts! Don't you people watch horror movies?!!!! I have watched hundreds of them and rarely do protagonists make it at the end! It's always the villain and when they do, remember the villains keep coming back! As much as I've seen movies where heroes die at the end, I started to feel like ""hollywood endings"" don't exist anymore, that's if they ever did! It truly repulses and wards me off when people say I didn't like this movie because the hero won!!!! or when they don't understand a movie which might be because the movie is rubbish, they just think it should be clever because they were stupid enough to not to understand it like the majority did with ""Eden Log"" !!!!

Terrible remake of an incredible original,"I read the above review, and wanted to completely disagree with it. As an aficionado of the Zombie genre, I too was extremely excited to see this film released. But I don't think I have ever been quite so disappointed.The original doesn't need me to describe how incredible it was. I regard it as one of my favourite films in any genre, and certainly the finest horror film ever made. In this big-budget remake they seem to have forgotten the entire premise of zombie films, and just gone all out for action.The acting and dialogue is terrible. The 'civilians' react to events rather more competently than the troops and police do in the first film, the zombies are badly made up, too fast, and overly intelligent, and there is little sense of atmosphere throughout the whole film. The post-credits handy-cam clip is perhaps the only redeeming moment of originality, but too little, too late.They even tried to use a pregnant zombie/zombie baby for shock value (See Peter Jackson's BrainDead), and they only succeeded in ruined the film further, adding an unnecessary (and probably unintentional) comedy scene.Don't waste your time on this: spend the saved money on some alcohol and watch the original again.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zombie-tastic fun,"Summary: Dead humans are returning in the form of zombies that attack and kill living people. A group of survivors hole up in a shopping mall while deciding how best to survive. Simple story, simple fun.The movies overall plot is very simplistic, but the individual events and subplots that make up the movie are very well written and well done. Almost all of the characters are written and acted like real people that one can associate with. The special effects range from needfully simple to well done on a large scale.The fact that there is virtually no background to *how* the zombies came to be actually adds to the movie. It adds the element of the unknown and reduces nitpicks on *how* the zombies should be acting/behaving (unlike Resident Evil that explained almost precisely *how* the zombies came to be, opening a whole can of nitpicks).Rating: Good story events, good characters, good effects, good time by all. I give this movie a 8.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
How do you make an original from a remake?  Watch Dawn of the Dead and see.,"As a longtime fan of the ""Dead"" series, which has stretched out for over three decades, I wasn't sure how much entertainment I was going to get for my hard earned dollar, so I did the matinee thing.  I had nothing to worry about.  This movie had comedy, drama, a little love thing goin', some gore, some tension and some very nice acting.  The undead were even much more believable than in any of the originals.  I think the running sarcasm played out among the characters set the tone for the film which help offset the well-established tension.  I really enjoyed this movie, much more than I had hoped too, which is always a great surprise.Two popcorns way up!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Awesome Movie, Great Plot","In My view of this movie, I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed the overall nature of the film from start to finish. *PLEASE NOTE* STAY FOR ENTIRE FILM, WHEN CREDITS COME ON, DO NOT LEAVE, THEY SHOW WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM ON THE ADVENTURE ON THE ITEM* Don't want to tell the film away but stay until the credits start rolling.In the end, the film was realistic on some points in it and some it wasn't. The film has a view scenes that would make you jump out of your seat and some that were predicted but the film overall, had action, killing and was a great flick. For such a low Budget film at 28 mil, they made a great film (strike) did. It is a must see!!

Alright but not what I thought it would be,"I've seen the original so don't accuse me of missed things. I gave the 2004 edition a 4 out of 10. Half marks lost because of the huge plot variation and another point out due to the stupidity that was born out of those changes.A REAL shame this is. They just had to change the plot so much, and made the movie much worse than the original. Especially what's with the ending?? And with the useless old people?? Seriously... Some scenes were nice like the Jay Leno joke and other characters, and the bhutane? box explosion. But the rest will simply not do. I prefer the original by far...Oh yeah, and this movie is NOT scary at all, jesus christ people, I can't believe that movie actually is scary to people today.

highly entertaining horror fest,"it was good, I've given it a 9 out of 10 rating. it has its flaws, the script has some plot retardedness, there was a complete lack of any human devouring going on except for one little ""cleverly"" edited scene (hardly even got to see any biting action), the characters werent as good as the original because there were like 20 of them instead of 4. but otherwise, it did what it set out to do, it gave us a hell of a lot of things which have been missing from the zombie film and was competently put together. some scenes were actually quite effectively horrorific even. the long shots, where they just pulled the camera right back out and showed shots of the entire city and/or landscape, were infused with a certain dread and horror that has rarely been captured in other zombie films. the credits at the beginning were nifty, but so not scary. it was tooooo mtv style to be scary, you know, hey look every 5 seconds we'll flash a close up of zombies on screen and you'll jump out of your seat!..... uhuh, don't think so. occasionally they let the idea that high impact speed horror is more scary than lingering knowledge horror get the better of them and it degraded scenes which couldve been much better. but, there were very few actual flaws with the film, and i think most people would thoroughly enjoy it. but yes, no entrails. no devouring of bodies. which for me, unfortunately, made it a little too much like 28 days later. the actions of the zombies became just brutal bashing violence, like 28 days later. it COMPLETELY lacked the absolute fear of being devoured and swallowed up by these creatures. the fear generated by this film is just nerve ending fear, you never feel it in your bones. but it was still damn good, and I'm sure i will enjoy it even more the second time round. and one should keep an eye out for how many exploitation movie references you can pick up on. wasn't so much references to particular films, but just ideas and styles that are classic 70s 80s exploitation, gotta love that cannibal holocaust scene :D although most people will think its just trying to rip off blair witch....*sigh*",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
a GOOD remake?!?!?!,"It's true! They DO exist! I know, I can't believe it either. This movie has been brought back from the (un)dead for some updated, innovative, zombie fun. The main difference I saw in the portrayal of the zombies, as opposed to how they appear in older movies, is that these zombies know how to RUN. None of that slow, rocking, arms straight ahead zombie walk. These guys will chase you down. Brilliant! The film starts with one of the best opening sequences out there, very well crafted, and it only takes about a minute to get right to the action. Great editing, and great special effects. Then the title sequence, done to a Johnny Cash song, is one of my favorite parts, and is highly entertaining on its own. The body of the film is rich with examinations of survival instincts and human behavior under pressure. A very smart, very scary, very fun movie. Brilliant!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
This remakes place in the trilogy,"First of all, let me say this.... this is one of the most awesome horror remakes I have seen in a while. Many times you see a ""newer"" version of an old horror classic and it falls well short of the thrill and chills the original gave you. This movie set the scene in the beginning to show you how much we take for granted our everyday lives, and how normal they are, how dependent we are on the rest of society to remain ""normal"" and ordered.Then all hell breaks loose. The action and thrills were on par with the original (which I watched as a child and was on the edge of my seat). This movie did not have Romero's flair, but then again, I guess it wasn't supposed to. My only gripe about this movie at all was that the zombies were fast, not slow. 28 Days later introduced the ""fast"" zombie, but then they weren't zombies, they were just ""infected"".... but i know a zombie when I see one. This movie seems to me like it was trying to recapture the audience that went out to see and liked 28 days later. They did a great job, but I just wished the zombies were bit slower and they had've stuck closer to the main script. What really impressed me about this film the most I;d have to say is in the end, when they took the boat and landed on an island.... Fulci's next zombie flick took place on an island... nice hand off, someone did their homework.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well Done Film,"Ok.  I gave this a 10 of 10 to boost its rating up from a 7.4.  This film is not perfect, but it is good.  I'd give it probably an 8 or so.  It is not like the original in terms of social commentary.  I wish it had more, but it would have needed to be 30 minutes longer.  This was an awesome action flick.While some say that you dont care about the characters, I disagree.  The one blonde chick, OK, i dont know her name either.  She was hot.  Real hot. CJ was such a badass that you had to love him, Ving Rhames was awesome, and the a few others you really cared for.  And a handful you really wanted to die...Painfully... And they did.Overall, if you like Zombies, guns, action, or horror, this movie is a definite must see.  Catch it in the theaters so we get a sequel!!--Quickdraw--",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Braindead,"I found this film to be truly awful, mainly because I don't like action films. I don't consider it to be a zombie film or even a horror film. Zombies are supposed to be slow and stupid because they are dead. Their muscles are supposed to have been damaged, decayed or suffering from rigor mortis. Their brains are dead and thus incapable of thought, this results in stupid behaviour and lack of coordination. This unnatural behaviour contrasts with what we expect of a human being. In other words we are disturbed by the abnormal movements of the zombie-human. This is horror. In this film, the monsters run about and act more like insane but otherwise normal humans. They are not creepy at all. They do have an exciting shock value. This is action.The director obviously had so little idea of how he wanted his zombie extras to behave that he resorts to some pathetically cheap shaky camera techniques. If you can somehow forget that they are supposed to be zombies you might be able to enjoy this as an action film, but not a horror film. It should not be called Dawn of the Dead.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"lots of action, baby","this movie has lots if action, from beginning to end, u must stay past the credits,and watch what happens. all the characters were cool, i liked the chainsaw part towards the endthat was just sick and cool.  ving rhames was ok, sara polley could of been better, but the guy who played c.j. was a real badass, i liked him. and whats with the dog, if i was a zombie, i would of bit him, a dog is a warm blooded and has flesh just like humans.the part with the baby was stupid, and a street thug living in wisconsin, dating a russian chick, and there was a huge amount of zombies in this movie,which is awsome.but overall, the movie was pretty good",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Excellent movie, but not worthy of the moniker.","It is certainly refreshing to see a movie like Dawn of the Dead is doing so well in the box office.  This movie was beautiful in it's presentation of the apocalypse, full of dramatic camera angles, pulse pounding situations, and a realistic view of how people would act when faced with almost certain doom.With the above being said, it doesn't deserve the name Dawn of the Dead. Despite the originals obvious shortcomings, i.e. cheesy make-up and techni-color blood, the originals story was much better.  It's presentation is stark, which in my opinion adds to the realism.  And the original is much gorier, which is part of the reason I see zombie movies to begin with.The similarities between the two movies are weak, basically being trapped in a mall, and the strong characters being a woman and an African-American the only similarities (for those of you who are younger, this really was an important issue back in 1978, with the original Dawn of the Dead getting praise for it use of different types of heroes).   The monsters of the new film, and the zombies of the old are not even comparable; they are completely different in their nature.I congratulate the makers of this film for what it was.  I wish it would have been released with a different name, since I feel it still would be successful.My rating is an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Definitely ""re-imaged"" but a great ""remake""","I enjoyed this more than the original DOTD. My major gripes about this movie were the plotholes, the lack of character development (most of the time you had many characters you could care less about), and the running zombies. It just doesn't make sense. HOW do the dead RUN??? Instead of overanalyzing it, I sat back and enjoyed it on opening day. There were some humorous scenes (the infamous celebrity-look-alike zombie shooting spree scene, uhh hello, that did NOT look like Burt Reynolds!) and even scenes that made me cry- namely the scene between Lindy Booth & Matt Frewer (you'll know what I'm talking about if you saw it) and the part where Andy holds up the sign that says ""Hungry"" and you could see his ribs. Pathetic I know. I never thought *I* would cry at a horror movie.In any case, the Richard Cheese version of ""Down With The Sickness"" was hilarious and a great cover, it wasn't as gory as the original but it was good. Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat. I plan on going again.I give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Zombies- 1 Story/plot/characters- 0,"Zack Snyder's directorial debut tackles the remake of George A. Romero's 1978 zombie classic, Dawn of the Dead. While Romero's original was a slow moving suspense filled gore fest, Snyder's version is just a gore fest. In this remake the zombies no longer shuffle about aimlessly. Now, they are feral creatures that will run at you as fast as they can, snarling horrendously the whole time. The film follows a group of people, including a nurse and a cop, as they make their way to a mall where they plan to hold up until this apocalypse blows over, or something like that. Of course, the calm and peace is short lived before hordes of the undead start making their way to the mall, forcing the survivors to find a way to escape this hellish nightmare.Zack Snyder is honestly the only thing that makes this film watchable. If not for his wicked visual stylization we would be left with an utterly silly film full of characters we can't wait to watch die. This is a plot hole ridden film where the characters actions don't seem to be backed by any logic or reasoning. These moments of total stupidity range from laughably bad to frustratingly moronic that you just want to punch something. Needless to say, we would all be screwed if we wound up with these people during the zombie apocalypse.That being said, if you like zombies and you like copious and almost over-the-top amounts of gore then it's hard not to enjoy Dawn of the Dead. It's so intense, so brutal, and so non stop that you really sort of become enthralled in the graphic events unfolding before your eyes. If you watched Dawn of the Dead when it first came out in 2004, chances are you suspected this Zack Snyder guy to be someone worth keeping up with. And of course, he was worth keeping up with because everything he has done since this debut has been an improvement of his style and eye for sick visuals.With a story that actually made sense all the way through and characters that we could actually sympathize with, Dawn of the Dead actually could have been really good. But its plot really drags it down tirelessly, and all we are left with is cool zombie action, and that isn't quite enough to save this film from being pretty bad.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Best,"The internet, because it is so high-tech, allows for many useful functions and uses. One of them is to let me tell everybody (who can read) how f***ing spectacular this movie is. No previous zombie film... maybe even ANY horror film... comes close to delivering as much terror and awe as this theatrical legend does. Any pessimist or coffee shop-employed, movie critic wannabe can just shove a cracked baseball bat up their ass instead of bitching about how ""It wasn't as good as the 1978 version."" or ""It reminded me of 28 Days Later...) WAAAH!!! Cry me a river and drown yourself in it, douchebag. This piece of work has a potpourri cast of characters that really beautifies the film and makes you think ""It's great that these people are here, respecting each other as humans, charging foward each day in an attempt to survive... however, it is sad that it took a tragedy of this magnitude to get them here."" Besides the characters, it has a great soundtrack for the type of film it is and shows vast improvement over the 1978 versions cliche disco-horror music. The lounge-version of ""Down with the Sickness"" and the closing credits song are absolutely fantastic. The movie itself is a great evolved piece of George A. Romero's screenplay and is a testament to his genius and Zack Synder's courage and prowess.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better then the original and beyond awesome!,"Dawn Of The Dead is the best zombie movie ever. Forget 28 days later, Resident Evil and the original Dawn Of The Dead this film tops them all. The plot is somewhat similar to the original but it adds many new elements which the original lacked. There are more characters and most of which are very well developed that you grow to like them or hate them. The story is presence and clear, This movie is also extremely fast paced. From start to finish not a boring second exists. The action is raw and excellent, the gore effects are outstanding and realisitc and there are plenty of clever wise cracks and non-cliche' dialogue that mixes in very well. Hopefully their will be a Unrated version in time. Even if you are against remakes of classic films don't be discouraged this film will stand strong for a long long time.

A decent horror flick,"I've wanted to see this film for awhile now. A lot of people said that Dawn of the Dead is a great horror film and it's gotten good reviews, so why not? I watched it. The film wasn't as good as I thought it would be. In fact, I thought it was more funny than scary because of how the dead zombies acted. The acting was alright, a few corny lines and some bad dialouge but they did alright, I guess. The gun owner named Andy was my favorite character because I thought he was a bad ass. Too bad things didn't exactly happen right for him. Overall, a decent horror film with some freaky scenes and the movie entertains you for sure. Usually, I tend to think that most all of horror films are really bad but this film wasn't bad at all, but just not exactly good. Decent film to say the most for Dawn of the Dead.

Worthy Re-make,"I approached this film with much trepidation. Although not an avid fan of Romero's original, I found the premise of the film fascinating.......the end of the world as we know it? a mysterious virus/plague/evil that reanimated the dead and turned them into vicious cannibals? Wow! in the right hands the story has all the ingredients for a great movie. I thought the remake was great. From the unusually sharp script to the believable acting of most of the characters ( the female lead in particular ). The use of Johnny Cash's ""When The Man Comes Around"" for the opening titles is one of the most inspired choices I have ever heard from an opening sequence. The film has many memorable moments, particularly chilling was the scene where the White House/Government spokesman answered terror stricken reporters questions about the reanimation of the dead with the heartbreakingly honest reply .......""We don't know."" A sequel from the same director would be most welcome. I thoroughly recommend this movie, just don't turn off too many lights when watching....................",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

There were a few flaws but I expected that.  After seeing the movie I was glad that the remake made several changes.  Dawn of the Dead (1978) is a classic horror movie, especially for that day in time.  It can not be duplicated.

In fact, in this film the dead are literally chasing you with a vengeance. This remake gave you everything that the original was lacking; 1)It gave you more action with zombies more mobile & possessing more strength. If you were to encounter 5 of these creatures your only hope of escape would be the use of a rocket launcher or the ability to fly. 2)You had less gore in terms internal body parts being exposed. Even the cannibalism was curbed. 3)You had a more extensive & more interesting crew of characters, even the bit part of Kenneth's roof partner was nicely done. 4)You had a more plausible and even frightening premise on which the ""Deadish"" came to being. The possibility of such a disease agent overtaking our society does exist with the deteriorating conditions of our environment. 5)You definitely have all the components for a sequel with how it ended.

Another remake - another failure.,"The last year was a year of remakes - exorcist, phantom of the opera, dawn of the dead etc. and they have one thing in common they failed. Of course it's always very hard to recreate the atmosphere of the original and balance between making the whole movie scary because of the feeling of hopelessness and loneliness the main characters feel or by showing zombies that look like a bad parody on clowns (terrible makeup etc).The original movie was quite nice for a zombie movie it had the atmosphere that was scary by itself and even the synthetic looking zombies couldn't spoil the fun. The remake lacks this atmosphere, the zombies look and act more like drunkards after a bar brawl rather than scary undead monsters that are hungry for human flesh.My suggestion - watch the original movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The first 10 minutes alone are better than many movies I have seen in the past 5 years alone. actually you never even get a chance to take a break from the start of the movie it's like a 100 min rollercoaster ride that doesn't stop.

Great fun,"This is not a scary movie - it is a Zombie movie and it does it well. The cast performed their roles well - nothing oscar worthy of course but perfect performances for the film.There are several comedy moments (intentional) and these make a welcome break in the tension of the film.Everything kicks off fairly quickly - no pointless hour long examination of how origin of the Zombies (I imagine this is covered in the previous incarnation - although it is a while since i have seen the remake of The Night Of The Living Dead). I am a fan of the original trilogy and I still enjoyed this sequel - the gore is more believable as you would expect in an update (blood is slightly less fluorescent than in the original) the shocks are there, the updated Zombies are excellent - they are fast and dangerous - a big problem i had with the original was that the ""Shuffling Zombies"" required you to be very very very careless to be caught by them - not these new ones, they will chase you down and tear you apart given half the chance.More could have been made of them being holed up in the Shopping Mall, like in the original, you never felt they were in any serious threat inside the Mall from the Zombies - although this was adequately replaced by a fear of each other.Stay all the way to the end credits as more action occurs during these - I liked this way of ending - it would have been a ""Too many endings"" syndrome if they had tried to put this in as a traditional end of the film but making it interspersed during the credits was a nice touch.See this film if you are not upset by gore, not expecting a frame-by-frame remake of the original (why would anybody bother to do this - Take Note producers of the Psycho remake), or expecting a reworking of a literary classic - this movie does not try to be any of these things and lets you enjoy it for it's own merits8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
B Action/Horror thriller delivers . . .,"Yes, I was at first pretty skeptical of this remake to Romero's memorable class-sick. WHY??? It's not like it was an older B&W B film, although I always preferred the original NOTLD in B&W for the grim mood it conveyed.Anyways, a friend convinced me to watch this 'remake' on DVD. I'm now very glad he talked me into it. The opening was smashing, and had me immediately engaged - not a single wasted second, thanks to good camera-work and tight editing. The sense of tension really grows as it appears that most of the world is now under siege from the killer-zombies. There is a strong, building momentum to the pacing and escalating menace which the characters now find themselves cast adrift in.The zombies move at a very fast pace in this version, giving it a riveting action edge. Comparing both the original and this remake is an 'apples & oranges' thing to me. Both stand on their separate merits, and actually compliment each other. Like showing two different perspectives of the zombie invasion from two different towns, and the similar gut reactions of both groups of desperate characters. Yay, I know, how does that explain why they are swift in one area and near-crippled in another??!! I'll consider any sound suggestions.For a taut entertaining horror/thriller this does deliver and it held my suspenseful interest til the end. The lead woman was the best character, followed by Ving Rhames who is solid and believable. I cared about the fates of everyone, and that is always a good sign, or, in this case, a bad sign. The sense of dread is prevalent throughout.One problem I had was that no one ever asks what is happening, what caused this; etc. They just accept it like recurring characters on a TV series. If you were suddenly caught up in this bloody nightmare, wouldn't you wonder what has caused this, and what the authorities are doing about it? The news announcers don't ever mention anything either or even express any wonder. Things like this can erode any suspense the film is trying to create.Otherwise, the zombies bear similarities to the infected 'zombie-like' killers in 28 DAYS LATER, but I found this to be a far better film. There are only a few gory moments, but they work within the film's tight structure.You may want to rent it some night when you're in the mood for a good zombie thriller. Just don't expect a great masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Why?,"In brief : It would have been an average zombie movie if it hadn't tried to connect itself to Romero. By doing that though it set it's standards miles too high and never came anywhere near them. If it had a different name and had dropped 2 or 3 stolen lines it would have been a 4 or maybe a 5/10. By reminding the viewer of better films though it rates at best a 3.Direction : Lazy best describes it. Zombie movies are not a genre big on story so to make a good one you need to make the world and it's characters really come alive. Snyder does OK with some of the characters but fails to do anything with most. Too many things happen without reason or purpose and he could have done with a few less survivors inside the mall.Cinematography/Editing - Amateurish and very annoying. Most scenes fell into two categories - ""ooh look at my new camera's zoom lens"" or ""I liked this shot in [other movie] I'll just steal that"". The two worst examples of the latter are the American Beauty ""look closer"" teaser shot used at the beginning and the 28 Days Later stutter shots used at the end. The AB one just ruined any attempt to build tension and the 28 Days Later rip-off totally missed the point. In that film it was used for scenes featuring the ""infected"" to differentiate their chaotic nature from that of the normal people. In this film it was just stuck over the last ten minutes because someone thought ""me likee, me steal"". Without context it was just annoying and cheap.Acting/Characters - The primaries were generally good and one or two were very good. Unfortunately there were a few that just got ignored and even the best ones were tainted at some point. For example - Ana and Michael - what on Earth was that about? I'll tell you what - some suit demanded a romance regardless of context or reason. Another example, the guards - they started out great and could have added a lot more substance to the film but instead everyone had to get along and ""bond"". Again I assume someone didn't like the idea of a film containing any kind of social commentary or depth. The gun-shop guy was a really nice idea, I wish they had used him a lot more and only had one or two people arrive in the truck. The couple with the baby are the best thing in the film, hands down. In fact they are the only thing that is in any small way worthy of the films claimed heritage.Gore/SFX - Not enough of it basically and nothing new or interesting.Plot - As I said above zombie movies aren't big here but this one had none, zero, zip. nada, not a bean. Nothing drove it on at all and consecutive scenes rarely connected at all after the first half hour. There is no sense of time passing in the film at all, they could have been there a week or a year but there's no way at all to tell. The passage of time and it's effect on the cast is central to the original but totally missing here.CHUDs - Adequate for the task but nothing special. Their behaviour and abilities are rather inconsistent but not so much as to be a major annoyance. The makeup required is now run-off-the-mill so it's hard to say much but that it was up to the job. I didn't like the way they ran - running is not so bad on it's own but they were just too co-ordinated by far. If they had stumbled more or something they would have looked a lot better. Biggest complaint I had here though was that there was nowhere near enough moaning and groaning.The Romero connection - I have no idea why they bothered. With the title changed and a few lines removed the only link would have been the mall and they could have just about got away with that. When compared to the original this film loses in every single way, including those where technological advances could have made it better. Almost all the things that mark the original out as a masterpiece are completely absent here and nothing is added to replace them.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
YES! Better than the original!,"Now let's get one thing clear right off the bat...I LOVE GEORGE ROMERO'S ORIGINAL MOVIE!!!! It is one of THE classics of horror. BUT....the remake surpasses it! Some have written that the movie makes no social statements. WHAT? Okay, the original made digs at consumerism by equating the zombies with mindless shoppers. However this one has a more profound subtext for a few of the characters. One of the survivors is pregnant. So the question is raised, as it is by many people in the real world, ""How can I bring a child into a world that's so screwed up?"".  The characters here also deal with an issue that the survivors in the original did not...what happened to their loved ones? In Romero's movie, NOT ONCE do the characters ever wonder about the fate of their friends and families. That issue is at the forefront of the new version. So to those that say there is no human drama here....what movie were you watching? But all that is incidental, what everyone wants to see this movie for is the zombies. Let me say to the purists out there....shuffling zombies ARE NOT SCARY!!!!! You can simply run, or in fact walk, right past them. Try that in the new movie. These flesh craving monsters will run your ass down, and be snacking on your vital organs before you can say ""undead"". Now THAT'S scary! The cast is excellent. Ving Rhames is the man, and owns every time he appears onscreen. Sarah Polley is a hottie, and maintains a cool head throughout. Jake Weber is very identifiable as the nice guy ""everyman"". You really care about these characters, and hope to see them survive. There is also great humor here. While on the roof of the shopping mall, our heroes communicate through large, handwritten signs with the owner of the gunshop across the street, who has retreated to his roof. There is a great scene where the on the roof of the mall, with binoculars, pick out zombies that resemble celebrities, and then have the gun shop owner blow them away. Also watch for the shop owner and Ving Rhames using their message boards back and forth to play chess. There are many nods to the original here, but they are very subtle. Watch for the heroes of Romero's version in cameo's. My favorite homage is right at the beginning of the movie. As Ana is driving down the road, we are treated to a high ariel shot looking down at her car on the highway. A helicopter flies in and out of frame. It is the same helicopted used by the characters in the original movie to escape the zombies that have overrun the city. So in the end, a great movie. Great tension. Great scares. Great humor. Great gore. A great treat for all horror fans.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Excellent action for the Zombie fan.,"I think the Original Dawn of the Dead (1979) is the best horror movie ever, when I heard of this movie coming out, I was scared they might damage the original.  However, I was excited that another Zombie flick was coming out and I threw away all expectations before seeing the film.  This new version is superb.It contains a lot of violence, and is probably one of the scariest movies ever made.  I would not compare this to the original because it is taken from a different point of view.  Any real Zombie fan must take this into consideration or your will ruin a great movie.  These Zombies are more vicious, faster, and smarter.This movie is extremely fast paced, which makes character development weak, but that is not why you would want to see this movie at the theaters.  The acting is performed well with the brief time each character has to present themselves.  Ving Rhames and Sarah Polley do an excellent job also with their allotted time.The Soundtrack is superlative for this movie.  The editing was good with a large amount of assemble edits that work really well through out the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Surprisingly Good and Fun,"Great film.  Just as good as the original but for different reasons.  You can never remake a film, so this re-imagining rocked.  This isn't the 70s, something needed to change.  After 30 yrs of zombie films some things had to change, and it worked.  people aren't going to react the same to Zombies as they would in the 70s.  If a some stumbling slow zombie came running towards you, I am sure a 12yo would know what to do.  The film had to change some things to make a Zombie film frightening in modern day.Also a loved the strong female heroine.  The chick in the last one was so weak and annoying.  This film benefited with the new idea of the kick butt chick, who does what she needs to do to survive.  It also has intentional humor in it, something old horror fans will aprreciate.  It was just a rocking good time.  As far as scariness they did as much as they could with a R rating.  Got away with some gross stuff too and a few good scares.The characters, and acting was really amazing.  The acting in the original was HORRIBLE.  So I'd say the the two films are equally good for different reasons.Also stay for the credits, there you will see the true ending.  Whomever doesn't like the ending didn't stay for the credits.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!!!,"I just got back from the theatre and i have to say this movie ROCKS!!!!I loved the original and i was very sceptical about the remake because i didnt think you could improve on an almost perfect movie but man was i wrong-I have only one complaint and it involves a small infant but i wont say a whole lot for those of you who have not seen the movie.the casting was perfect...Ving Rhames,Sarah Polly they were meant to play those parts and they were even able to include cameos from Scott,Ken and Tom(who btw had the best line of the movie!)The makeup was not overdone and the special effects were outstanding-I think this is the version Romero might have wanted the first time because he said in his commentary of the original film the he wanted more zombies and there were a ton of them in this film.Some people criticize the film saying you dont need running zombies but i felt they were done very well-if you were hungry and was starving for food i believe you would run for it also.I felt for these characters even the not so nice ones and I think that helps make a great film-you feel sorry for the not so lucky ones and cheer for the unlikly heroes and feel the suspence in a dire situation.A very good movie and i can't wait to see this again.Ty",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very bad remake,The original 1978 Dawn of the Dead is a great movie this remake is awful. It is badly written. The ending is awful. It is not scary.

Dawn of the Dead (1978) is a fellow to Night of the living dead (1968) Night of the living dead (1968) is a lot better then this awful movie. This is not a 7.4 that is just overrating it. The story line in this movie awful. The fellow up to Dawn of the Dead (1978). Day of the Dead (1985) is a lot better. The fourth living dead movie. Land of the Dead is a lot better.

Uber Zombies!!!,"As a former film student I was always aware of the original Dawn of the Dead and even though it is by todays standards quite slow with emphasis on the build up and anticipation I was not familiar with Zack Snyder's take on the zombie genre/remake.Knowing Snyder's style I was intrigued to watch his vision and was both surprised and thrilled at what I watched!The Uber zombies are a far cry from Romero's - strong, fast (really fast!) and relentless, this has to truly be the birth of the modern Zombie that we now associate with, be it World War Z or I am Legend the influence from Snyder is evident.It was a shame Snyder did not get to helm a sequel, I would have loved to have seen it!Definitely one to watch....

As brilliant as a remake can be!,"Now, I'm not really a stranger when it comes to zombie movies, having seen more than just a handful of them. But I think that it is still safe to say that this movie certainly is among the lines of one of the better zombie movies out there.I can't remember ever having been that impressed with any 'modern horror movie' for a while now. There isn't a single aspect about this movie that I could have imagined to be better. Although there are a lot more characters than in the original, each of them does manage to maintain a different personality which therefor doesn't make them appear to be just 'fill-ins'. The gore and effects are undeniably amazing and there are scenes that might even make the biggest gore fans cringe (chainsaw). What's also interesting is that this remake manages to capture the same dark humor as well as the claustrophobic feel (although not as intense) as the original. There isn't a single minute that's remotely 'boring' (even though many people will deny it, it's probably even more exiting than Romero's version) and it has some nice twists in it. Overall, this is an amazing movie that I would recommend to anyone ..",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Awful, Awful, Awful","I have to say, though fairly new to the zombie genre, this has to be one of the worst zombie films I have ever seen. I do say that Tom Savini's work is one of his best, but still, flashy gory make up, and flashy explosions do not make up for the loss of plot, depth, character development or over all story in general. This movie breaks with the tradition of zombie characteristics (they can't run, they're dead for God's sake!). I rated this around a 4. This movie would not as bad if solely on it's own merit,however, the fact the director is piggy backing on George Romero's current Trilogy, with out the social messages, or overall script complexity really hurts its rating over all. To dispel accusations that I am anti-new zombie films, or that anyone but Romero can't do a zombie flick, just know this, if you really want to see a good zombie film, go see Sean of the dead. THat parody is twice as zombie-riffic as this.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Remake Mania: Dawn of the Dead,"Dawn of the Dead (2004) was pretty good. I was very surprised when I saw this movie on V.C.D. a few months back. I have to say that I was very impressed. The script by James Gunn and the direction was on par with the original. Ving Rhames was the man. He played his role quite well and was creditable as the tough cop. The set pieces were up to snuff and the gore effects were excellent.A strange mutation has quickly spread across the land. It hit so fast and so hard that nobody was prepared for what was to come. Society collapsed along with the military and the government's ability to try and contain the situation. Thousands of the living dead roam the streets and what's left of the survivors are either squabbling, bickering or killing each other off. A local mall as become a magnet not only for survivors but for the hungry and ever growing horde of the living dead. A nurse, cop, a family man and a young couple seek refuge in the mall that's under the control of three security guards who are still ""on duty"". Can any of them make it through the ""dawn"" so they can survive another ""day""?Like I said before hand. A very good remake of the original. Instead of trying to do a scene for scene remake or an ""inspired"" by version, the film makers wisely incorporated both elements to create this release. I haven't seen the new director's cut yet but from what I have already watched I have to say that I'm very impressed. Impressed indeed!Highly recommended!AKeep an eye out for three stars from the original film. A nice treat fro fans of the original film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hell on Earth,"I just got back from watching this remake of the George Romero zombie classic and I am happy to report that it does justice to its predecessor. I was little wary that the zombies run in this version, but it really works because you can't simply walk past these bad boys and shove cream pies in their rotting faces. This version probably owes as much to 28 Days Later as it does to Romero's film. The movie kicks into gear in a matter of a few minutes and scarcely takes it foot off the throttle. The acting, by and large, is very good and the effects are terrific. I hope it makes mucho bucks and inspires a rebirth in the zombie genre, perhaps even Romero can get back into the action.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

"Gory, but not scary.","Pardon my impertinence, but aren't zombie movies supposed to be scary? Or are they supposed to be funny? After watching this remake of George A. Romero's 1978 thriller (itself a sequel to 1968's Night of the Living Dead), I'm all confused.To sum up, some kinda plague thingy breaks out, turning nearly everyone into jibbering idiots. After a while, it's hard to tell which ones are zombies and which ones have simply been watching too much election coverage. All heck breaks loose. Loved ones are killing each other. Little kids, too. Everyone's gone all higgledy-piggledy.A hardy bunch of survivors makes its way to the most American of inventions, the shopping mall. They have all they need - food, shelter, TVs, XBoxes, and a zillion zombies patrolling outside the mall, desperate to get in and feast on the nice, fresh meat.Lemme stop for a minute here and wonder out loud. (Note: This is a rhetorical question.) Why do zombies need fresh meat? Why can't they just feast on each other, or even themselves? Would they even notice if they bit their own hand off, for example? (Okay, that was three rhetoricals.)So our intrepid gang barricades itself inside the mall. But they soon want to get out. They're holding out hope that somewhere out there, there's someone who's not quite dead yet. You know, somewhere where the zombies haven't quite taken over. Like Canada, or something. But we the viewers know better, don't we? This is as good as it gets, staying in a mall all the time. If it were me, I don't know if I'd ever leave.But oh, those nutty survivors. They're communicating with the crazy cat a building or so over via sandwich board, playing chess long distance and the like. We see all kinds of fun and exciting activities, all set to a peppy song, whose name and beat I have conveniently forgotten for all eternity.So they want to get out. Their plan is to commandeer two of the mall's shuttle buses, fortify the crap out of them, and off they go. Well, bad things happen. The end.This movie failed for me because at no point was I scared. I didn't jump out of my seat, or even shudder. Sure, there's gore, but it's pretty mundane. If you've seen one head explode, you've seen 'em all. (Oddly enough, when someone shoots a zombie in the head late in the movie, Ving Rhames is inexplicably impressed.) Movies like this need to have a strong sense of reality; the viewer must be able to imagine that this is happening Right Now, outside his or her own door. And this movie utterly failed to do so for me, which made it take on a surreal and ultimately comic sheen.The acting's no prize, either. I know these guys had little interesting or unique to say, but I felt little sympathy for them regardless - and that's the actor's job. Convey to me how awful your situation is. I wasn't openly rooting for the zombies, but sometimes I felt like it.One final nitpick - the ending credits sequence contains footage of What Happens Next. It's very, very jarring; credits are shown on a red background, then there's a quick cut to video, then back to the credits, on and on and on. Distracting and pointless.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

A great zombie movie,"I'm a very avid fan of zombie movies, and like any huge fan I am very familiar with the original Dawn of the Dead. It set the bar for apocalyptic zombie fests and contained a brain inside its gory exterior. The new Dawn doesn't have that. In fact, the new Dawn doesn't have anything that made the original so great... aside from the mall, of course. That doesn't make it a bad movie. If this movie were named something else, I wouldn't have a single complaint... I would be raving about how fantastic of a zombie movie this was. But they decided to have this as a remake of a Romero classic, and they ripped out everything that made the original so... original. The new Dawn is scary, visceral and fast paced. If they would have slowed it down, and stepped it back a bit so the viewers could get a chance to know the characters, and see the characters reaction to their situation it would have paid better homage to the original. They're different movies, and they are both great in their own right. The new Dawn is excellent in its own way, and in itself sets a new standard for zombie movies.

not a good review,"I'm begging for a refund and to be paid for the 2 hours of my life wasted watching this movie. NO real story line, no surprises, nothing other than zombies who kill people, but only when the people are dumb enough to get close to them. Lots of potential in the beginning, but once they hit the mall, there is no story, just a random series of events leading to an ending. I think they threw in a little bit of nudity in the middle to get people who were drifting away to focus for a few seconds... Good Lord, Waterworld was better than this piece of crap. I know 5 year old kids who could have written a less predictable script. How did they get out of the situation when the gassed the zombies and burned them? Did that eliminate ALL of the zombies down there? How in the world did every person in that movie learn how to shoot like that?

As compared to the original,"From the first 15 minutes of the film, I quickly decided the newly revamped Dawn of the Dead was my new favorite horror film. This feeling carried me to the very last moment of the credit reel. The directorial style and cinematography brilliantly blended new aspects of thriller genre camera work, basic narrative portrayal, and the same kind of old school shots found in the original version of the film. This adaptation picked up the horror where the original version left it more as subplot for the in-your-face down-your-throat satirical attempt at political statement and assult to capitalism and the blossoming consumer market. Don't get me wrong, the political aspects weren't entirely unfounded and were well thought out in some aspects. It was saturated with symbolism and hit on some major discussions of the time. My problem with it was it wasn't about the zombies! If I want political rhetoric, I'll watch an Oliver Stone flick. If I'm watching a movie entitled ""Dawn of the Dead"" I want zombies. I want ripping and eating and blood and gore and let's not forget fear for lives and too-close-for-comfort escapes.The new version was full of all the aspects I crave in a good horror film. Suspense, gore, character connection, and those nice little moments where you actually pop up from your seat a bit. Honestly, I must admit I don't know what makes the original a classic but I am surely glad they decided to do the remake. Granted there were a few holes in the plot, moments that you say to yourself, ""Why the hell didn't they just do that a couple weeks ago if that was an option?"" However, I suppose that's just a constant in the horror genre. If everyone was logical not nearly as many people would be killed, situations could be better averted, and we would have no plot to unfold.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
*Much* better than the original,"For all the hype it gets from its small but devoted cadre of fans, the original Dawn of the Dead is really, really cheesy.  A mall with a gun shop and tons of ammo in it?  A few zombies that move slow as molasses in winter? A helicopter that can take them outta there whenever it gets too dangerous? Where's the terror in that?  Most of the movie is spent playing around in the shopping mall.Not so with the current version.  The zombies here are mean and *fast*--and there are zillions of them.  The terror and despair are real--as is the drama.  Everything is precisely calculated and has its reason.  Characters change as they live under the strain of balancing compassion with survival. Unlike the cardboard cutouts in the earlier version, these are real people confronted with an unimaginable horror.  Some respond better than others, but both the action and the character development make sense and ring true. Even the music is far superior to the original.  This is a masterpiece that has borrowed little more than the title from the original--and a good thing too.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's a shame to have George Romero's name associated with this version at all!,"The story had so many holes; questions, missing pieces and throw in an out-of-character moment that ... (I can't say. You have to see it for yourself). The actors tried. You watch to see who is going to live and who was going to die, but when it's over you realize you didn't care. It's difficult to make a remake, but in this case I wouldn't had said anything if the director cheated a little and took some ideas from Romero. ""28 days later"" took the thunder out of these zombies and that movie, even though the director denied it, was somewhat of a combination of Romeros' dead movies (watch ""28"" for comparison; it's not 10 times better, just better). The producers threw the equipment and experienced people to surround the new director, but it was a Freshmans' attempt.

I know a lot of zombies movies start off with almost everyone killed. in this movie however the news show policeman and miliaray men going after, shooting and killing zombies on the TV news flash where the main characters are. so they still do have a lot of people who were not bit by the zombies in this movie that make cameos. it is a more realistic movie then the other comedy/zombie movies. this is the best zombie movie I have seen.

The makeup for the zombie's was good also. It made it seem real. None of the two dollar movie make up most ""scary"" movies use. The acting was a little off in some parts, mostly in the beginning.

This movie could not have been remade any better.  Zack Snyder did an excellent job!  I have seen all the others several times and I could watch this one over and over and over as well.  For someone to remake a classic sets them up for disaster if they are not careful and this remake was an absolute success!   I could go on and on about the differences between the original and this one.  But is not worth it, as they are two distinct  movies that stand out.  Can't wait to see what else is next, as many classics are being remade.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
worthy remake,"as a fan of the original, i was pleased...i wasn't sure what to expect, but it was both entertaining and scary...it took the ""28 days later"" approach combined with the Romero version of ""turning"" into a zombie...i liked that...it was also the only flick i've seen that a zombie does a certain thing...and i've seen a few zombie flicks in my day...it was more of a homage than a remake...the mall setting, but even that was different...the dialog was snappy and the directing was definetly decent for someone who, i guess from what i know, directed commercials before this...disturbed's ""down with sickness"" was a fit well...it won't win any oscars, but, on the popcorn scale...10 for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
great remake,"this is definitely one of the better remakes. I would have to say this movie is actually better than George Romero's original 1978 version, which was also pretty damn good. Starts off with one of the most frightening scenes of the movie. A group of non-infected civilians bunker down in an abandoned shopping mall and join forces with a few rental cops. They then struggle to survive and fight off what seems to be a never ending on-slaught of zombies who want to enter the mall. One thing that differentiates these zombies from others is that they have some pep in their step, they can run! The actors play convincing roles. There is extensive violence and gore, especially in the uncut DVD. You can clearly see this was produced with a decent budget by a major studio (universal). I highly recommend this movie. Get the uncut version on DVD if possible.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
The One Zombie Film to Watch,"I'm not into zombie flicks, at all. I fell asleep during Night of the Living Dead. I dislike horror to a certain extent, too. But I'm so glad my zombie flick & horror fiend friend recommended this film to me, truly. I can even call it one of my favorite films.It's a very character-based and focused film. This is not a bad thing, at all, it's what makes and shapes the film and it's the one thing that makes it stand out over all other zombie flicks. In my opinion it's what makes it superior. You get to know the characters, you live with them, you fear with them, you laugh with them.. It's almost as if you're one of them - that's the mood every horror film hopes to reach but often fail to.The acting performances are good and even the tiny bit of romance works in the context of the film really well. The special effects, especially the fast moving zombies are fantastically made and just awesome to watch.The ending hurts because you really truly learn to like and enjoy the characters when you watch this film. At least I did. But still, at least you know you just saw a good film, when a film grabs hold of you like that.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Undead Remake,"Remakes prove that even when a film is done and dead, it may be reanimated and, like the undead here, oft in a more sickly form. If you're looking for improved zombie make-up and effects and more frills in the flesh-eating and head-shooting action, this ""Dawn of the Dead"" may be for you, but if you expect a more compelling reason for one of the classics of the subgenre, George A. Romero's 1978 original version, to be remade, this is a pretty pointless endeavor. Between the additional cluttering of characters in this second iteration and continual set pieces of the living fighting the ghouls mixed with episodes of the living yelling at each other, one may be forgiven for not noticing the utter lack of comic relief, social commentary, or merely even trust in the audience to piece things together relative to Romero's film.The after-credits sequence here is a good example of how nothing is left to the imagination. With Romero, we may wonder what ultimately happens to the remaining heroes. Director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn, instead, prefer to keep everything simplistic and tidy--something that also served them well with superhero franchises. At least, I suppose, this final sequence involves a character video taping it, which is rather unexpectedly reflexive. TV is also employed earlier on as surveillance and, as Romero did, for largely unnecessary news broadcasts. Regardless, there's also no insinuation, as with Romero, that the living are like zombies in their unreflective materialism, as well as with the warring with each other. Heck, the remake even goes to pains to explain the mechanics of zombies--head shots, effects of bites, etc.--as though we aren't already overly familiar with said conventions.It's no wonder the gang here is so eager to get on with what seems to be a suicide mission for the climax; they have little apparent reason to live in the first place. Families die. Jobs are gone. The only guy from a church is an atheist, while others consider an alternative worse than death. And chess, sex, shooting and smoking only entertain one for so long. Romero's group had lives inside the mall worth protecting and appreciated their bounty. This gang, on the other hand, just seem to be looking for a diversion to pass the time and overly willing to risk their lives for an adrenaline rush.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great movie in it's own right,"Wow! I just got home from seeing dotd-2004 and can't wait to add it to my collection. Even though I saw the original several times in the theater when it first came out, I was able to enjoy this one a lot also. No, this is not a remake as in ""true to the original"". It is an update of that concept, with some welcome homages to the original thrown in (Gaylen Ross Fashions? Cool!). I've already heard a lot of criticism out here, but really, I think people need to refresh their perspective, put their pre-conceived notions to the side and enjoy it for what it is: a truly original concept that was created in 1978, updated here to tell the story of another group of people fighting their way through this incredibly impossible situation. Didn't you wonder, watching the original over the years, about other people and their stories of trying to survive the situation? I know I did. And after all, if Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger (not to mention the great one, Tom Savini) lent their endorsement to this project by being in it, why knock it? Relax and enjoy! My  rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
