Turn off your brain and just enjoy....,"The most important thing you might wanna know about this review is that I am certainly NOT in the target demographic group for this film. As a 53 year-old man, I am not the type to ever watch ""Pitch Perfect"" in the first place and did so only because my daughter insisted that it was a good film and I would enjoy it. And, fortunately, I did enjoy it quite a bit. Now I am NOT saying I think it's a great film, it certainly has its faults, but it is fun and entertaining.The film is about a capella singing....certainly not the sort of thing most of us enjoy or even care about...though the film manages to infuse the subject with enthusiasm. And, you'll soon find yourself moving along with the singing...and much of it is very infectious. And, the film is about most every stereotype I could think of when it comes to young adult films---you have the bossy and nasty leader of the group, the lesbian, the fat girl who is funny and the rest of the clichés (such as the final big number where not only do ALL the ladies know the lyrics BUT also the choreography of a song they NEVER practiced). But, it manages to make it enjoyable because it SAYS that these are stereotypes at times and the music is pretty cool. I could have done without all the vomit, however. Overall, this is a very watchable and enjoyable picture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Geared up to hate this, but ended up loving it.","When my girlfriend suggested put this on I mimed blowing my brains out with an imaginary revolver.That was a mistake. This is a great, fun film!An all girl acapella group have to regain their crown by winning a competition.
So a motley crew of underdogs is assembled, including our main character, to challenge the superior competition.The characters are heavily stereotyped, and this is the source of a lot of the comedy.
I found the characters engaging and lovable, and laughed along with most of the gags.
The cynical, misogynistic, judgemental, biased commentators were especially funny.The singing segments are short and sharp and just enough to get your foot tapping without going full blown Mary Poppins.I didn't expect (or particularly want) to enjoy this but I did a lot.My recommendation is that even if this is not your kind of movie force yourself to watch the first fifteen minutes, their is a good chance you will make it to the end with a smile on your face.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
It has been years since I have seen a movie that I had such low expectations for...,"That I loved so much. I scored free tickets to a Denver Screening awhile back and was just going to have my wife and 13 year old daughter go , but I watched the trailer and really thought Anna Kendrick was terrific in 50/50 and very good in Up in the Air so I thought, what the heck, I'm going too. Was I glad that I did. I laughed like crazy and loved the a capella singing. This film is really raunchy and just skirts around an R rating several times, but it is just so fun.I am pretty confident that it is going to be the surprise box office hit of the fall and it is so much better than the films that it is bound to be compared to like Mean Girls, Bring it On, and even Bridesmaids.Speaking of Bridesmaids Rebel Wilson almost steals the show with every scene that she is involved with being hilarious, and in a lesser movie her scenes most certainly would be worth paying the price of admission alone, but there are so many other talents involved. Elizabeth Banks has never been funnier. Skylar Astin as the love interest is also terrific though he needs to change his name, because for me the name Skylar brings only one thing to mind and she is married to Walter White.This is no Oscar Winner, I am certain that I will see a dozen or so better movies this year, but none will having me laughing and smiling as much.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Watch out - you're going to like it whether you want to or not!,"We two 50+ grandmas went to see this film on the spur of the moment because we enjoy musical movies. We were probably the oldest people in the audience which ranged down to younger teens but everyone, regardless of age, was laughing and having a grand time. Much less schmaltzy and self-serious than Glee, but wonderful vocals and dancing and personality. You can't help but fall in love with the hilariously quirky characters, especially Rebel Wilson as the irrepressible Fat Amy, Elizabeth Banks as Gail, the sexually frustrated female announcer, and Hanna Mae Lee as Lilly, the wackadoo who releases the most shocking comments in a voice that barely exceeds a murmur.

Typical underdog movie and reasonably entertaining chick flick,"""Pitch Perfect"" (PG-13, 112 min) is a light, inconsequential musical comedy about college and Capella groups. It's one of those movies that would have been a big box office smash hit in the early '90s when these types of comedies really sold. The film has enough pleasures to overcome its failings, even if the margin is fairly slim at times and entirely predictable, which makes the whole feel, like thing been-there-done-that. In a way, ""Pitch Perfect"" (2012) is pretty much ""Bring It On"" (2000) with a Capella-singing instead of cheer-leading. The cast is full of good actors ( Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Elizabeth Banks) but like most modern comedies, it's ~20 minutes too long, yet at least the music works well.Rating: 6+/7-",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Crazy Funny!!!,"Take Bring It On, Glee (not in the icky cheesy way, but because there's singing involved, the good kind), Mean Girls, and add some quick-witted, sharp-tongued dialogue and commentary, and you have the funniest of movies.At first I was leery: a movie about A Cappella singing groups; I thought at best, it would be a teen flick. Yes, I know, Anna Kendrick. But bigger (some better) names have made some doozies. But, I was unbelievably surprised. Every kind of humour is covered here, and done to absolute perfection. You will be adopting many, many of the lines into your daily lexicon.For me, Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy) and Elizabeth Banks (as Gail, the commentator) have some of the most hysterically smart lines ever committed to celluloid (right up there with Young Frankenstein).Loved it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"What ""Glee"" Wishes it Could Be.","""Pitch Perfect"" is basically ""Bring It On"", but with a cappella singing groups instead of cheerleadersand it's also a million times funnier. Directed by Jason Moore and adapted by Kay Cannon from Mickey Rapkin's novel, ""Pitch Perfect"" tells the story of Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) an aspiring DJ attending Barden University, who's hobbies include seclusion, nonconforming and listening to Mashups (which kind of makes her a conformist). In an attempt to have Beca become more socially active, her father (who is also a professor at the University) urges her to join a club on campus. But upon perusing each club (especially the glee clubs) she quickly decides that the loner lifestyle is far less humiliating. That is, until a rather awkwardly nude run-in with one of the members of the The Bellas, an all-girl a cappella group on campus that sings nothing but Ace of Base. And since The Bellas are coming off of an embarrassing loss at the previous year's singing competition, Beca, as well as a multitude of other ""a ca-losers""; including Fat Amy (as advertized) and Lilly, the girl who can apparently speak no higher than a whisper, are asked to try out in a desperate hope that a group of misfits could be just the thing that sends the conservative Bellas all the way to the finals of the national Glee-esque competition. And if this doesn't sound generic enough, there is also a love story subplot centered around Beca and a guy who looks shockingly like Dane Cook. OK, so if this sounds like every teen flick that you've ever seen, about a misunderstood misfit who ends up helping the popular kids (that were mean to her in the beginning of the movie) win their something-or-other championship/tournament, only to discover that in the end that they are all the same no matter their social standing, then that is only because, from synopsis alone, ""Pitch Perfect is exactly that. But before you write this dark horse off, let me just say that due to a sharply satirical script and a surprisingly hilarious, eccentric and immensely engaging cast, which include the likes of Brittany Snow, Hana Mae Lee, Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy) Skylar Astin and Anna Kendrick, giving a performance which not only solidifies herself as a true leading lady in any genre, but also as the new Kristen Bell, but with talent, ""Pitch Perfect"" does elevate itself far above the mundane-ness of your everyday teen comedy. In fact, from the non-stop laughs, to the quite satirical teenage dialogue, to the perfectly hilarious ""Best in Show""-esque banter from Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins, who play the two commentators of the national a cappella competition, ""Pitch Perfect"", aside from a curiously abrupt ending, works on EVERY level; even in its rarest of sappy moments.""Pitch Perfect"" vs. ""Glee"": The main reason ""Pitch Perfect"" works so well is actually quite simple. Where ""Glee"" is so in love with its self-proclaimed perception that glee clubs are the new ""cool"", this is a comedy that isn't afraid to make fun of a cappella groups, glee clubs and people randomly breaking out into song, while at the same time presenting interesting characters that audiences want to root for. So, if you where thinking of avoiding this film on the basis of your dislike of ""Glee"" (or that awful show ""The Sing-Off"") but find yourself being dragged to see it anyways, no need to worry because chances are you will be happily surprised by what ""Pitch Perfect"" has to offer.Final Thought: Even though most of the comedy here is on the cruder side, this is still a PG-13 venture. In short, ""Pitch Perfect"" is not the raunchy female buddy comedy, filled with overlong skits about feces that ""Bridesmaids"" was. But good news""Pitch Perfect"" is so much more funny and (more importantly) more accessible than ""Bridesmaids"" will ever be. What I mean by ""accessible"" is, men will be able to watch this movie without hearing the phrase: ""You wouldn't get it because you're a man."" All kidding aside, I haven't seen a comedy with this much clever teenage personality since ""Easy A"". So, in the comedic cesspool that has been 2012, filled with half-assed attempts such as ""That's My Boy"" and ""The Watch"", ""Pitch Perfect"" is not only my pick for the biggest surprise to come out of the genre this year, but also the funniest movie of the year (so far); narrowly edging out ""21 Jump Street"".Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

"Ridiculous, but it knows that it's ridiculous","Pitch Perfect is ridiculous, but it knows that it's ridiculous. The fact that this movie is in on the joke about how seriously these characters take acapella singing makes it enjoyable. The whole cast has moments where they shine, yet Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp, and Brittany Snow really are the standout performances. Even Rebel Wilson is more humorous than annoying. Plus, despite the corny choreography and cheesy vocal arrangements, I enjoy the songs they sing throughout the movie.

Musical done right,"This new comedic musical is right on pitch. Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a student at Barden University whose dream is to move to LA and become a DJ. Beca is uninterested in college, to say the least. Her father is a professor at her school and he advises her to join clubs to get more involved. Beca starts to work at the school radio station along with her admirer, Jesse (Skylar Astin).When Beca's voice is heard by Chloe (Brittany Snow), one of the main girls of The Barden Bellas a capella group, Beca is recruited into this singing group. Jesse ends up joining the rival all-boys a capella group called The Treble Makers.Beca soon realizes that The Bellas need some new music in order to improve their reputation and make it to the finals. However, the leader of the group, Aubrey (Anna Camp), is quite headstrong and refuses to change their music. The tension between these girls and The Treble Makers continues to grow and everything begins to unfold.Walking into this movie with very low expectations, I definitely was pleasantly surprised. It is a musical done right. There is no breaking out into song; the only time people sing is during competitions. In fact, the music is terrific and I can't wait to download the entire soundtrack.I was expecting slapstick comedy, especially with Rebel Wilson in the cast, but ""Pitch Perfect"" rests at the borderline. Speaking of Rebel, this movie would be nothing without her. Hilarious lines mixed with her perfect comedic timing equals a workout for your abs. It comes very close to stupidity but it doesn't quite cross the line.""Pitch Perfect"" is cute, silly, and fun. If you're looking for some laughs, take a watch.

This film wasn't meant for me,"POSITIVES:1) The commentary duo at all the a Capella competitions were funny
2) Some of the jokes worked
3) The music occasionally sounded goodNEGATIVES:1) I was put on the back foot straight away because I thought the Bellas performing I Saw The Sign sounded great but then in the film it gets ridiculed. Then all the stuff that I think sounds terrible the film thinks is great
2) It's yet another ""teen"" film that has absolutely no sense of what being in college is actually like

Something Special,"I didn't want to like it. Despite what you may think I don't want to like movies like this . I hate myself for it. But there's such an overwhelming charm when things are executed just right and I just can't help it. Pitch Perfect centers on Becca played the emerging star Anna Kendrick (in a role which will solidify her status if it its as big as it deserves ) a freshman at college. Her father is a professor and she's angsty and rebellious. After a brief set up we enter the unknown world of acapella singing, Which is singing with no instruments. Apparently a huge thing at this college and we meet different groups there well 2 mostly the troublemakers an all male group that always slays the competition and the Bellas who churn out the same old fashioned nonsense and are recovering from a year that didn't end well to say the least. After some persuasion Becca joins the Bellas looking to add some of her much needed zest to liven up the competition.I'm sure you can guess what happens and it's no lie that the film is formulaic in that way. However, the approach to the material is what differentiates it. It's handled with an original, saucy, smart originality. it doesn't downplay it's focus but instead celebrates it in all it's corny glory. The film takes a little getting used to but about half way through i was so sold on all the wonderful characters and the films undeniable charm. Filled with exciting musical numbers and solid performances from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy, the adorable Skylar Kenstin as Beccas love interest and so many others Pitch perfect is something truly special. Not to say t's flawless it's a little amateur in spots and Brittany Snow's character feels a little confusing. But it's easy to overlook the small stuff when the film is so entertaining.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Moderately Entertaining,"The concept of acapella and the music is entertaining. But the story line, bad attempt at humor and typical Hollywood stereotypes was annoying.

A-ccaGlee,"Anna Kendrick plays Beca a moody, stroppy and reluctant freshman at Barden University who wishes she was working as a DJ.The Barden Bellas are a female a-cappella group whose authoritarian lead singer (Aubrey) throws up when nervous and in the new academic year are struggling to find new female recruits. Beca decides to join the group but is in conflict with the Aubrey who seems to think despite evidence to the contrary that selecting safe songs from the last century will beat her all male rivals from the same college, the Treblemakers.The film has a feel good feeling with plenty of songs new and old sang in pitch perfect a-cappella, great if you are a fan of the TV series Glee.The film is however pitch perfectly predictable, schmaltzy and with all the stereotypes under the sun with some racist undertones (what a surprise it is a Universal picture, the company well known for killing off the black guy in the first ten minutes!)People from Far Eastern heritage have a hard time getting decent representation in films but here they make one Asian person out to be a weirdo and another to be socially intolerant and racist against whites. The black lady is a butch lesbian and the guy who gets his group disqualified because he was not a student is black as well. For some reason because the the filmmakers want you to think they are equal opportunity racists they also picked on deaf Jews in order to make a DJ joke.Anna Kendrick's character is dislikeable and her love story subplot was poor. Aubrey is so bossy you wonder why she is not on stage as a soloist as no one else would ever sing with her because of her attitude.Aubrey never realises that getting nearly beaten by a glove puppet singing group might be more to do with her failings.On the positive side the songs keep things bubbling along, it presumably would make for a good date film even though there is some gross out humour here and there. Rebel Wilson keeps things fun playing the bubbly fat stereotype.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Acamazing!!,"I wasn't quite dragged to this but nor was I rushing to sit in a cinema full of 500 teenage girls to watch a Glee rip-off.It didn't take any dragging to get me back in the second time. This movie is being so undersold. It should be bigger than the Hangover.This is what Glee should have been. The music is awesome. The dancing is awesome. The script is awesome. The performances are awesome. Some of the set piece performance scenes had people in the audiences spontaneously clapping.Anna Kendrick is amazing!! She is angsty and grumpy when she needs to be without ever losing out on being sexy and alluring and smart.Rebel Wilson is hilarious! She takes set-up gags and lines that deserve a snort of derision and makes you fall off your seat with her delivery.Elizabeth Banks (with more than a little help from John Michael Higgins) almost steals her own movie out from underneath them all despite having less lines than Arnie in the Terminator.And the supporting cast are fantastic. Even where they are trying to play stereotypes they take enough of the edge off them to make them lovable in their own right.The musical director and the script writers for this absolute gem deserve to be picking up armloads of awards. The script synopsis is basic, nothing clever at all, you know the ending from the start. But that doesn't matter, the journey to that ending is simply fantastic.And it is worth going twice. Some of the jokes are well hidden. Tucked in behind others so you are still laughing at the first and you miss the follow-up. Some are even hidden in plain sight but you are too busy watching something more obvious.

Super Re-Watchable,"Pitch Perfect is an incredibly re-watchable film. From the likable cast to the fantastic music, it is easy to be charmed by the world of collegiate a cappella.Though Rebel Wilson's performance can become tiring in other projects, her original authenticity in this film is fun to watch. Her blatant improv and physical comedy make the slower moments jump off the screen.With a fairly straight-forward plot and smart third act payoffs, it's hard to walk away from Pitch Perfect without smiling.Additional opinion: Jesse is one of the most likable characters in modern cinema.

Combine a killer soundtrack, outstanding performance and a classic storyline, this film is perfect for the average Joe.

That I find some issue with.Overall, I'd say it was a lovely film to watch, if you can forgive its shortcomings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"as in, it is good i was impressed","I really don't like chick flicks, they are all too predictable and at the very end they don't surprise you. Pitch Perfect is not that different from any other chick flick I know, but it was fun watching, the build up to the grand ending is the same as others, but the comedy is more matured and that made it easy to receive, other than the weak dialogues and lame script writing that are common in other chick flicks. I recommend that a guy should watch this with a girl.The thing that first turned me off in this movie was when I saw them singing, (I really don't like chick flicks and I hate music competition films) I just sat at the cinema hall thinking yikes!!! Then things started to turn and then I actually found myself laughing, the comedy that Pitch Perfect brings is very entertaining. It makes you over look the strings and loose ends in the movie.The funny thing about this movie again is that it is actually a non- fictional story, based on a novel of the same name by Mickey Rapkin. The movie stars Anna Kendrick (50/50 (2011)) as the lead in this college flick and it was produced by Elizabeth Banks (Man on a Ledge (2012)) who also can seen in this movie as she plays one of the commentators alongside John Michael Higgins (We Bought A Zoo (2011)).The movie is about two a cappella groups from a university but kind of like focuses on one of them, The Bellas and all female a cappella group, who recruited new girls into their group after their previous year disappointment, which led to them losing all but their two lead members.Beca (Anna Kendrick) joins The Bellas, and starts to shake things around a little, causing one of the lead members Aubrey (who is controlling) wanting to get Beca off the team as soon as possible, so she can regain full control of her group.The movie is directed by first timer movie director Jason Moore who is a regular stage and TV director, who in my view needs to work on his movie direction too, because the movie directorial was kind of weak, there were incidents where things happen for no reason what so ever. The lead girl Beca (Anna Kendrick) who happens to be a DJ, but all throughout the movie her DJ skills are not in any other way influential in the movie plot as a whole. Then the cheap Apple Macbook advert, comon we the viewers are not that dumb.Pitch Perfect made a good bunch from the box office making more than 84 million dollars compared to its 17 million production cost and it is highly rated having a 80% approval ratings from critics in the review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes.

Anna Kendrick is great in this as she is in most of her films, her personality in this film is just great and she stands out as one of the best in the film, I also love Rebel Wilson, she is easily the most likeable character in this film and is one of my favourite characters to ever be put in a music based film.

Strains mightily against its PG13 rating,"""Pitch Perfect"" becomes a somewhat painful experience for empathetic souls who can feel the writers struggling against its PG13 constraints. The biggest confirmation of this is a joke involving one of the a Capella singing groups covering Lily Allen's ""F*** You"". It has to pull its punches by only suggesting bulimia jokes around Anna Camp's character Aubrey. Seriously dark lines are uttered at a whisper by Hana Mae Lee's Lilly although these are some of the funniest in the piece (as a bonding ritual she's asked her biggest secret to she stops the show with ""I ate my twin the womb"".) It's unfortunate the producers didn't abandon the tween market and go for the ""Hangover"" hard-R crowd - while funny this could have been hilarious. As far as the cast Rebel Wilson's ""Fat Amy"" (""it saves you having to call me that behind my back anyway"") stands out among a group of actresses not sufficiently distinguishable from each other.

"Fun, But the Song Numbers Can Be Hit or Miss","I only got wind about this film after I saw a couple of teenagers singing a song a capella while rhythmically flipping tumblers during a birthday party. They said it was from ""Pitch Perfect"" so I sought out a copy to see what this film was all about.This film's theme is very much like ""Glee."" Some misfit girls try to make their mark in college by joining a disgraced a capella singing group called the Bellas. The story follows the girls as they try to be the first all-girl group to win Nationals. However, with all the drama queens in their small group (ala ""Mean Girls""), it is not going to be easy an easy task.This film is very popular with the teenage set. However, for me, the humor is already very much at the boundary of raunchy comedy at times. Definitely, it crossed the gross-out comedy boundary of PG with all the inexplicably voluminous projectile vomiting scenes. There were some weird comedy like the mousy Asian girl Lilly whose voice was so soft you'd wonder how she got into a singing group at all. (She is cute though, but she says the darnedest things, if you actually hear what she says.)The personality of Beca, as played by Oscar nominee Anna Kendrick, was so unlikable. She sticks out like a sore thumb playing it so seriously while the others were obviously having fun with their characters, especially Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy). I can't really say I was rooting for her at all.The singing scenes, which were supposed to be the highlight of the film, were hit and miss. Some were very good, like ""No Diggity"" and the other songs sung during the sing-off in the gym. However, there were those where the mix was not too good. The final song number by the Bellas in particular, while generally good, was marred by a terribly pitchy solo by no less than Beca herself.Anyway, despite all my problems with the execution of this film, in general it was entertaining to watch. I can completely see why the teen set loves this film with all the hip song mash-ups and the funny scenes and lines, but I do hope they are mature enough to recognize that is only ""comedy,"" so far from what really matters or happens when they are in college.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"A fabulous, intoxicating burst of vitality","It took me a long time to ever get around to this because the very concept seems built for cringe - the awkward ham-handedness of college comedies, smashed together with the vicarious performance anxiety of watching people sing and/or dance. To this add ready, well-trodden thematic content of tradition and experience versus innovation, the veteran who is as stubborn as she hard-nosed and driven, social troubles, the angst-ridden fresh face, social difficulties, and pride. In the broad strokes the movie is both familiar and maybe a little tired; the foundation is solid, but it's the foundation for countless other titles.On the other hand - where the average title that's most comparable would use that foundation to build a three-bedroom house, there's no mistaking that screenwriter Kay Cannon and director Jason Moore have instead constructed what in relative terms is basically the synesthetic equivalent of a Frank Lloyd Wright. If the narrative is kind of ordinary, then characters are a good few miles in another direction, each given particular quirks that let them shine in turn. The dialogue and scene writing, meanwhile are on an entirely different continent, and 'Pitch perfect' bursts with sharp, smart, vibrant life that far outshines any subjective shortcomings. I assumed for years, sights unseen, that I might enjoy this; I was wrong - I absolutely love it. Rich sincerity is paired with delightfully witty humor, and the cast all demonstrate fine skills in bringing their parts and the story to life. But nevermind that, for more importantly everyone shows truly outstanding singing abilities to let the picture soar far above its brethren. There are many recognizable names and faces among the ensemble(s), and here they inject the title with jubilant electricity that not even zero Kelvin could stop from starting a fire in my heart. It's impossible to single out just one, because Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp, Ester Dean, Hana Mae Lee, Utkarsh Ambudkar, and all their co-stars are brilliant and luminous. It's an extra measure of joy to see John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks in anchoring roles as commentators, adding further cheeky comedy to the proceedings; other films struggle with such inclusions such that they feel like a distraction, but I'm ever so pleased that in 'Pitch perfect' Higgins and Banks' scenes are balanced and smoothly folded in.Moreover, the most earnest congratulations are in order: the music in this film is extraordinary. Never in my life have I paid much heed to a capella, as it just doesn't fit my preferences, but especially when combined with vivid, intoxicating choreography, the result is a ritual of song and dance that is utterly spellbinding. I genuinely had a hard time pulling my eyes away from the screen lest I miss one glorious moment; dazzling, shrewd rearrangements of popular tunes are manipulated into magnificent new shapes. Put this all at the mercy of a fabulously talented cast, and garnish with terrific costume design and hair and makeup work, and the result is altogether magnetic.We all can name movies that we've stumbled across and thought we'd probably like it, but they don't immediately come across as something usually up our alley. I was never in a rush to check out 'Pitch perfect' because the concept definitely struck that chord for me. Now that I've finally committed to watching, I can only regret that it took me so long, for this is outright wonderful. Any criticisms one may reasonably level pale in comparison to the enchanting stimulation the picture provides; plenty of films leave us with a good feeling, but few make us want to jump up out of our seats and cheer. For ten years I've been a fool, but no more - 'Pitch perfect' is a fantastic revivifying celebration of music, and if ever a single song has sparked your fancy, then this is a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
An enjoyable film but had the potential to be great,"Pitch Perfect is surprisingly a good film. It certainly hits the ground running from the start by introducing us to the world of Capella singing and the prestigious prize groups compete for. The singing is very good, it includes both old and new music. However older music would have been better than a rendition of modern beats we call music. Viewers are treated to some exceptional singing throughout the film as the groups sometimes show it is effortless for them to sing. The humor is also not bad and lightens up the film.What brings this film down is the romance. Not only was it dull it was completely unnecessary. It completely holds back this film from being a great and deeper film with great music thrown in. The Breakfast Club is a classic that explored certain themes in a simply way and it was referred to now and then but Pitch Perfect failed to come up to that level. It was brought down by a cheesy, light headed and silly romance. Instead of realizing the potential to make an artistic and well thought of movie, what was below the belt guided a big part of the film. Anna Kendrick was also an unlikable character who seemed spoilt and uncaring for others. Once again if the romance was dropped and more focus was on character development or other deeper themes this movie would have soared.Overall an enjoyable movie with great singing and performances. If it realized its potential and used its ingredients well it could have been a lot more, perhaps a classic like the Breakfast Club was in its own way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Funniest film of 2012,"¨You're one of the a cappella girls. I'm one of those a cappella boys, and we're gonna have aca-children. It's inevitable.¨I laughed so hard during this entire movie, Pitch Perfect is this year's Bridesmaids. The dialogue was so funny that I actually thought the screenplay was written by Tina Fey, but I was surprised to find out that Kay Cannon (30 Rock and New Girl) was the person responsible for adapting it considering this is the first film she works on as a screen writer. What is even more surprising is that the film was also directed by first time director Jason Moore. Two relatively unknowns in the film industry have made what in my opinion was the funniest movie of the year. I could watch this film over and over again considering it has a funny script and an excellent soundtrack. The film is very catchy, but at the same time it knows the material is ridiculous and plays along with it. I felt like it was a sort of satire on Glee at times, but it balances really well the idiotic moments with some cool choreographed a cappella songs. Several scenes will remind you of Bring it On as well. I just had a lot of fun with this movie. Another thing Pitch Perfect has taught me as well is that Anna Kendrick can carry a movie as a lead actress. She's been amazing as a supporting actress in other films, but now that she had the chance to have a lead role she delivers. She should get bigger roles in Hollywood because she has proved she has the talent. Some might find this film ridiculous, because it does borderline on several whacky situations, but at the end of the film it's impossible not to leave it with a huge grin on your face.Becca (Anna Kendrick) is a freshman from Barden University that dreams of going to LA and becoming a DJ, but her father is a professor at Barden and urges her to study there at least for one year. If she doesn't like it, then he promises to help her out with her plans to go to LA, but under the condition she get more involved in the College activities. That is when she decides to join the Barden Bellas, an all girl a cappella group headed by two other students: Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (Anna Camp). After a disastrous participation in last year's collegiate finals, Chloe and Aubrey are having a hard time recruiting new blood. Besides recruiting Becca, they also call on Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), Stacie (Alexis Knapp), Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean), and Lilly (Hana Mae Lee), some very unconventional picks but needed in order to face last year's champions: the all male group, The Trebles. They are managed by Bumper (Adam DeVine) who recruits Jesse (Skylar Astin), a close friend of Becca's. The Trebles are the favorite to win the competition again this year, but the Bellas will do whatever it takes to go one step further and win the championship.Pitch Perfect is a cross between Bring it On, Mean Girls, and Glee; although it takes itself way less seriously than the TV series does. Anna Kendrick is great in the lead role; she shines in this film and has a great voice as well. Rebel Wilson gets the most laughs with all her impromptu monologues. She is extremely funny in this film, as she had proved in the past with Bridesmaids. Elizabeth Banks also has a small role as Gail, the commentator of the collegiate competition, and she is really funny in this. Every comment she makes is hilarious. I was really surprised by this whacky comedy, and what I enjoyed the most was the feel good ending with some great musical performances from the a cappella groups. This is in my opinion the funniest film of the year and one I wouldn't mind to watch over and over again. Be prepared to laugh.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Great fun!,"Pitch Perfect (2012) is an example of a movie that exists for the sole purpose of entertaining an audience in a really fun way. Almost all movies are meant to entertain in some way, but they differ in how they go about it. Some try to teach lessons and send important messages, where as others are there to make you laugh and feel good, Pitch Perfect is one of the latter. It's not limited to a teenage/young adult audience, but that is the main target audience, and I believe that it's one of the best young adult movies we've seen in a while. It's not just thrown together like a sloppy mess, it's actually very well done. The casting is near perfection, especially Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and Skylar Astin who are the spirit of the movie in my opinion. The other actors do a great job too, but I thought those three just really shined the brightest. Elizabeth Banks and is hilarious too. The writing is smart, entertaining, and has a funny-sweet tone that really works. I highly suggest this movie for everyone!",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
You can't help but have a good time with this film,"Pitch Perfect delivered in every aspect I wanted it to, and excelled itself in many respects.It has a pretty good plot, basically all the drama and music you'd expect from Glee but a movie version. We follow a bunch of college women who come together in the form of an acapella group and try to claim the national collegiate title. There are trials and tribulations along the way, both within the group and between groups. There's romance, friendships, great music. It's all pretty easy going, tongue in cheek, and light and breezy. Just what you want from this type of film.The characters were all well done. Some of them were a tad too annoying and they leaned into these traits a bit much at times but it wasn't ever too exhausting. Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson were the standouts and gave great performances, with all the cast giving solid performances.Really with any musical film the most important thing is the music itself, and Pitch Perfect didn't disappoint. The soundtrack went straight into my Spotify library, with some inspired mashups and great vocals.What's not to love with this film really? Great songs, fun plot, decent humour - looking forward to watching the second one!",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
What a STUPID and BORING movie,Everything is bad about this movie. Not a single redeeming quality. Nada. The story is lame. The one liner jokes are not funny at all.

"Surprisingly good, despite what a summary of the movie would have you think.","This movie is hilarious and is full of great moments. The spew scenes for instance, shocking, gross and very memorable. It is no doubt what contributes to launching Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson's careers from this point on and now they are obviously Hollywood staples.The side characters all contribute really well to the momentum of the story. And somehow its not a massive fail. I remember mocking a close friend of mine who loved this movie, when I thought there could be no way that a acapella singing and dancing movie could be any good. But its light hearted, talented and great performances all round from all involved, especially Anna Kendrick who I find very likeable.I take back my mocking and know now that they were right in saying this is a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"""Pitch Perfect""-  A delightful comedic gem.  Charming, warm and often laugh-out-loud funny!","I'd have never thought that as a 28-year-old male who is decidedly a fan of all things horror and exploitation that one of my favorite films of the year 2012 in retrospect would have been ""Pitch Perfect""- a hilarious musical comedy about an all-female A Cappella group that's full of spunk, light-hearted laughs and near-endless charm. But after having seen it for the first time earlier this week, I'm completely hooked. Much in the same way that films like ""Mean Girls"" and ""Clueless"" sort-of transcend their genres and become cultural phenomena that all can enjoy no matter age, gender or general movie preference, ""Pitch Perfect"" is definitely a movie for everyone.We follow Beca Mitchell (Anna Kendrick), a freshman at Barden University, who dreams of moving out to California to start a musical career but is forced into attending college by her father- a professor at the school. When her father offers to let her live out her dreams should she join a school club and tough out the university for one year, she ends up joining the school's all-girl A Cappella group- the Barden Bellas, which is lead by the talented but domineering Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp). While they train to beat their school rivals- the Treblemakers, Beca tries to shake up the group and help them to become better singers and better friends with the help of the other new recruits. (Including the hilarious Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp, Ester Dean, Hana Mae Lee, Kelley Alice Jakle, Shelley Regner and Wanetah Walmsley)The key to the film's success really lays in its excellent casting and the sharp wit of the banter and dialog. As an ensemble, you couldn't ask for a better group of performers. Kendrick is a wonderful lead for us to follow, and she's very accessible and identifiable as a protagonist, with a great sense of humor and an adorable attitude. Supporting roles by the likes of Rebel Wilson, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow and the rest of the Bellas are just wonderful- particularly the highly entertaining Wilson who brings many of the belly-laughs with her great improvisations. Skylar Astin makes for a good love-interest in Jesse, a young man who becomes quickly infatuated with Beca. And smaller roles like Adam DeVine as the slimy leader of the Bella's rivals and producer Elizabeth Banks as a very tripped out commentator are also quite good.Jason Moore directs from a script by former ""30 Rock"" writer and producer Kay Cannon. Loosely inspired by a non-fiction book of the same name, Cannon and Moore create a unique and highly entertaining world and aesthetic for the Bellas to inhabit, and they inject a lot of great fun and thoughtful character development for each and every performer. As she has shown on her previous television work, Cannon has a way with her writing to craft fine and highly comedic yet also fundamentally touching story lines and she shines once again. Moore has a very confident sense of visual storytelling and he also knows when to let his cast improvise and inject their own ideas into the mold, and it helps to build the film up to what it is- exquisite entertainment.Add to that a host of wonderful song choices, extremely well- executed musical sequences involving the groups performing at various competitions, plenty of great subversive laughs and some unexpectedly shocking gags that take you by surprise and you just have a good, solid little flick. If I absolutely had to complain about anything, it would be the very minor issues I had with some of the more clichéd moments that crop up now and again. While I won't spoil them, I will say that anyone with even a passing knowledge of film theory and structure will probably see the majority of the twists, turns and developments coming from a mile away. But given that the film is more focused on just absolutely charming its audience and delivering consistent laughs, I can forgive this. It's a minor issue in an otherwise near-flawless film.""Pitch Perfect"" is just such a pleasant surprise. With wonderful characters being portrayed by fantastic performers, a witty script filled with great humor and solid visual direction, the film is a just pure, simple fun. And I give it a near-perfect 9 out of 10. If you haven't seen it, be sure to give it a shot. And ignore the many nay-sayers you see popping up here and there... they just don't know how to let themselves have fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Another good quarantine-prompted surprise,"The only good point about being stuck at home is finally going down the 128 movies (as of today) I added to my watchlist over the years. I can't say a movie about an all-girl acapella college band sounds super appealing to me but I recently watched A Simple Favor and since, to my surprise, I really liked Anna Kendrick's performance I thought I might not completely hate Pitch Perfect. Even though it's a bit cliche and predictable at times, the characters (yes, Anna is great as expected) and fun musical numbers make this a very enjoyable piece of entertainment!

A Nutshell Review: Pitch Perfect,"By the time the ending of Pitch Perfect rolls by, you can just about guess that one day, this will make it to the stage as a musical. After all, it has all the necessary ingredients for a more up close and personal experience, with a zero to hero story, great songs that can be changed each time it's staged (and keeping it fresh of course), and characters that are feel good, funny, with nary a villain just opponents battling it out for the top prize in acapella singing.Directed by Jason Moore, who cut his teeth in Broadway and at the helm of his debut feature film, here's something that had the battle of tradition bubbling beneath it, dealing with adaptability to change rather than sticking with the old that can only get you so far at times. And it can be applicable to any field, because while it may be OK to embrace tradition, sometimes sticking to the same old doesn't produce results when others have already moved along with the times, and developed key changes to put them ahead.For the Baden College Bellas, the all girl acapella group that finally made it to the finals of a competition amongst college peers, they literally choked up, and find a new school year being their year of redemption, if only they can recruit new blood. Leader Aubrey (Anna Camp) and her lieutenant Chloe (Brittany Snow) eventually do so, with a riff raff of college freshies who make it through the auditions, before finally find it an uphill battle to try and convince them to do things the original, strait-jacketed way. It's typical of a zero to hero that the Japanese have perfected in their similarly themed films, where a motley bunch have to unite to achieve a common goal, but having to battle internally first before they can do so with others, personified in their college rival, the all male team calling themselves Treble Makers.Anna Kendrick has top billing for headlining the freshman group, starring as Beca, an aloof girl whose interest lies in mixing music and aspiring to become a club DJ. Skylar Astin gets thrown into the mix as the newcomer to the Treble Makers, who also tries his best to hit on Beca, if not for her rejection of his advances. Yes, this is as rote a development of a relationship between the two, especially when the Bellas have a sticky no-dating-of-Trebles rule that didn't make too much headway in the film.While the many caricatures in the Bellas have some of the funniest lines and scenes, perhaps it is Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy who stood out the most, since she exhibited perfect comic timing with her performance, and is very much self-deprecating for the most parts. What's more, coupled with an awesome voice and great stage presence, she steals everyone's thunder in the movie, and is undoubtedly one of, if not, the favourite with everyone who had come to watch this. Her performance is probably the only thing you'll remember, besides the musical arrangements, days after you've watched this movie.Loosely based on Mickey Rapkin's non fiction book of the same name, which had the writer spend significant time exploring the real world of college acapella singing, Pitch Perfect boasts an almost insightful look at the squabbles and rivalry amongst members, especially when ego and distractions come into play. The story has its usual college student angst, with laugh out loud comedy peppered all around that makes it fun especially when things aren't taken too seriously. But what made this movie about acapella singing work, is exactly acapella singing and the performances themselves. Credit goes to the music producers of Ed Boyer and Deke Sharon from real acapella communities to know just about what works, and what doesn't, and to design a formidable set list for the film, ranging from the bland (deliberate for the Bellas robotic, lacklustre show), to the mind-blowing mash up of genres that begs listening to.Oh, and those who have not watched The Breakfast Club, too bad that this film will spoil it for you with the ending literally highlighted time and again. Pitch Perfect may not be perfect given a rather straight-forward narrative, but it's the showcase of songs, and individual performances, that makes it a champ. A definite recommendation!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A delightful look at college days with singing,"Beca (Kendrick), an entering freshman at fictional ""Barden College,"" aspires to be a DJ in L.A. But her father, a professor at Barden, insists she attend college at least a year plus join some activity group. Last year, Barden's male 'a cappella' singing group, the ""Treblemakers,"" won 1st place in national collegiate competition. Barden's female group, the ""Bellas,"" had 'ill fortune' and, trying hard to do better this next year, is actively recruiting new members. Beca joins it. At ""Barden College"" these 'a cappella' singing groups seem to serve some of the same roles that Greek fraternities & sororities or membership on college football/ basketball teams do in most colleges: group socializing, achieving, winning school honors by competing for victory with other colleges. Beca's reluctant to join and, once committed, is reluctant to trust or be close to anyone, e.g., a boy (Astin) in the ""Treblemakers"" who's interested in her. ""Pitch Perfect"" with its sexual jokes (and projectile vomiting that rivals a fire hydrant: make ""snow angels"" in the vomit on the floor, anyone?) is funny throughout, especially so to the 18-30 year age group with college experiences and, among those, probably more so to its females. My girlfriend & I saw this in a college town where audience laughter drowned out our hearing many lines. The music with lively choreography was great; wish there was more. (Many say that Rebel Wilson as ""Fat Amy"" wins the acting credits.) Its view of contemporary college humor was fascinating to this grad from decades ago plus I loved the music. (FWIW: IMDb's gender X age ratings are also fascinating.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The right tone!,"Absurdly fun film, hits all the right notes! You go into it with low expectations I think, but come out surprised. Not exactly a ""Glee"" fan myself so I was not expecting anything but annoyance, however it delivers very well. Rebel Wilson is the necessary comic relief and slapstick gal, she has some great one liners. Anna Kendrick is one of those actresses you either like or dislike, I definitely dislike. But she gets away with it this time around as she's got a load of fun female support to keep the movie going. Give it a watch!",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The actresses are talented for sure.,"One thing this movie about college level a capella singing competition demonstrates is that the actresses involved are multi talented from the control freak played by Anna Camp to the lovely Brittany Snow and of course Anna Kendrick. They can sing dance whatever. But Anna Kendrick as a the lead wasn't quite right. She is better in a supporting role. Anna Kendrick's face can't express different types of emotion, eg anger sadness happiness - it's all the same showing a bit of teeth like a beaver. The girls are the stars here. The leading boys are rather dorky and forgettable. Breakout comedic star Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy provides comic relief.The writing isn't that good some scenes could have been funnier. But at least it isn't as hyper and freakish as Glee. Some rather surprising negative stereotypes shown but overall it's quite a feel good pleasant movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Cool and funny movie.,"About a few months ago, a friend of mine introduced this to me. I kinda thought it was a movie about drama, but I watched it to find out. It was hilarious, the quotes the characters say and their actions. It was an excellent movie for me, and it was one of the best movies I have ever seen, but it wasn't the best. I would have gave it a 10 if it wasn't for the ending (hint: post-performance), but it's a 9. It was still a funny movie that is full of entertainment. Also watched it with a few friends that have not heard of this.Highly recommended for comedy lovers and fans of A Capella. Loved this film, and for some reason I cannot stop watching it. I also loved the music and the voices of the Bellas and the Treblemakers. I watched it about eleven times. Love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Surprising humor takes control of what could've been just a college comedy,"Nothing about the premise of ""Pitch Perfect"" suggests it should be a funny movie, or anything more than a diversion for ""Glee"" fans who've burnt out on the hit show after three-plus seasons. A cappella groups might be a change of pace for Hollywood, but college humor isn't, with most college comedies going straight to DVD bargain bins these days.So even after seeing ""Pitch Perfect,"" it's a total wonder how it manages to stay fresh and entertaining. College movie clichés lurk around every possible turn of the plot, but ""30 Rock"" writer and producer Kay Cannon, who essentially wrote the movie (it resembles Mickey Rapkin's book in name only), artfully dodges, embraces and twists them in surprising ways, and the cast working with it fulfills its end of the bargain too.The film stars Anna Kendrick as Beca, a freshman at fictional Barden University who's an aspiring DJ preoccupied with mixing her own mashups. Reluctantly, she's recruited by the Bellas, the school's all-female vocal ensemble, led by the authoritarian Aubrey (Anna Camp), who's hell-bent on taking the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella (which exists, actually) away from the school's all-male group, the Treblemakers. Problem is, Aubrey wouldn't know hip if it bit her in the ass. Beca rolls with their old-school ways and never- ending performances of Ace of Bass' ""The Sign"" until it's clear they need a shakeup if they want to win it all.But ""Pitch Perfect"" isn't some competitive singing movie that plays out as a ""will they or wont' they win?"" drama. In fact, there's almost a total disregard for that element of the story. Audiences who go primarily for the music might even be a tad disappointed that most of the songs are kept to snippets, and director Jason Moore does little to emphasize the quality of the singing or the music itself. The script sticks squarely to comedy, hoping to surprise you with its sense of humor.The best comedies have strong supporting characters who can take attention away from the predictable core story, usually a romance, in this case Beca's friendship and eventual spurning of Jesse (Skylar Astin), a freshman Treblemaker who interns with Beca at the campus radio station. ""Pitch Perfect's"" ace is Aussie Rebel Wilson, the recognizable roommate from ""Bridesmaids,"" who plays Fat Amy, a new Bella with boisterous personality and loads of confidence. Wilson's one-two punch of deadpan and self-deprecating humor takes the edge off the ""Mean Girls"" dynamic established between Beca and the two older Bellas, Aubrey and Chloe (Brittany Snow).The other girls in the group possess just the right amount of quirkiness to be memorable rather than stereotypical. There's a black lesbian, a whispering Asian and a tall slut to name a few. The guys of the Treblemakers, led by Bumper (Adam DeVine of ""Workaholics""), act cool, but in the nerdiest way possible. The script is keen on reminding us that these characters are all in singing groups, and therefore by definition, nerdy.The laughs extend as far as the competition commentators, played John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks, who frankly don't exist. No one is listening on the radio to these things, and it's not even clear they're even being broadcasted. But they're for our enjoyment to be sure. Not since the team of Gary Cole and Jason Bateman in ""Dodgeball"" have commentators been this funny.""Pitch Perfect"" thrives on this genuine wit, which perfectly masks how irrelevant the rest of the movie is. As the director of hit Broadway show ""Avenue Q,"" Moore understands how humor and music work, but even he would concede ""Pitch Perfect"" is about the former. The script's sharpness is matched only by it's conscious effort to avoid the clichés that comes with this territory. Even if you think you know what the joke is going to be, there's some twist that will come later.The ending, always the worst parts of these movies, avoids all the gooey stuff too. It's so nice to see a conscious effort to deliver something unexpected in a genre that filmmakers so often use as an excuse to lean on the conventional. It just so happens that a movie about college a cappella was lucky enough to be the recipient of this refreshing approach.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Anna Kendrick Is My New Crush,"""Pitch Perfect"" may not be the kind of movie that will change anyone's life, but it did push me a little bit further into falling in love with Anna Kendrick.She plays a bit of a loner who gets involved in her college's acapella group (the members put ""aca"" in front of all their adjectives, like ""acamazing"" and ""acaxcuseme?"") and has to fight the group's uptight leader to freshen up their act in the hopes of winning a big annual tournament. The screenplay is completely by the numbers, and you can call out the film's plot developments three scenes before they happen. But if it's lazy in the categories of character development and dramatic tension, it does have a knack for one-liners, and the jokes come fast and furious, keeping things moving along nicely. Kendrick is an absolutely winning and adorable presence, and the film ably pokes fun at acapella groups while paying tribute to them at the same time. It does for acapella what ""Miss Congeniality"" did for beauty pageants.Grade: A-",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

The misfits get in tune for Pitch Perfect,"With the popularity of Glee, it was only a matter of time before a movie of some kind was made to try and capitalize on the subject. With Pitch Perfect, they take on this same idea but attempt to do something a bit new. With a cast including Brittany Snow, Elizabeth Banks, Twilight's Anna Kendrick, and the always funny Rebel Wilson could they have delivered something special or will it just be another forgettable musical?Pitch Perfect follows an all-girl a capella group who thrive on their good looks and pop sings, but after a disastrous performance during the previous year's finals, they are forced to regroup and take on a new unlikely group. As far as story goes there is nothing new here. It's pretty much just the normal underdog story bringing together the misfits to deliver something special, but thanks to some fun cast members and outrageous moments delivers something a bit more. Rebel Wilson really steals this movie every time she steps onto screen. There will be some people that are annoyed with her, but she delivers on every level. She clearly isn't afraid to make fun of herself and it takes her performance to another level. The rest of the cast do a fun job of bringing this film together including some musical numbers that weren't just over the top annoying. The music choice worked better than most of these types of stories. Where Glee uses a theme to tell their story and sometimes works, here it was used to tell the story as well as establish the characters personalities. There are even moments where they seem to be mocking some of the characters and works really well. If there is a complaint, there is the expected evolution in the underdog group, but their final performance really never delivers that satisfying punch it needed.Pitch Perfect was an unexpectedly fun film that works whether you are a fan of musicals or not. This young cast works well together and performs their songs effectively to take an otherwise average film and make it something that stands out a bit. There is talk of a sequel, which is no surprise, and if Rebel Wilson is back then it might work given the right story, but either way give Pitch Perfect a try, it's a pretty fun time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A film that caught my eye,"Pitch Perfect is a comedy film set in Atlanta, specifically Barden University. This mesmerising film is directed by Jason Moore, also known for ""Sisters"", and the cast includes Anna Kendrick as the main character named Becca and other talented actress like Rebel Wilson and Brittany Snow.The plot concerns about a freshman in Barden University who joins an all-girls ""a cappella"" group, The Barden Bellas, in their battle to make it to Lincoln Center to compete in the ICCA. There will be also an entertaining romance between the two star roles.The cast is excellently talented, due to the performance of Rebel Wilson who makes this film the most hilarious one of 2012. She is hands down second to none. I would also like to point out the ""a cappella"" music, which has stunned me all over the film. Moreover, the acting and the costumes are extremely natural so it seems as if it's real. So it was the surprise box office hit among teenagers when it came out.The film is well worth seeing. Related to what I have said, I highly recommended it to those who also like Glee or music, teenagers and catchy films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Rebel at the Movies,"This afternoon my husband and I braved the holiday crowds and saw the film Pitch Perfect. I loved it but my husband hated it, putting it in a category of films like Broke Back Mountain (which almost destroyed our marriage after I insisted we see it) and Moulin Rouge. Pitch Perfect is about a college singing group. Throw in a love story, some really great singing, a few laughs and that's about all she wrote. It won't win any academy awards and my husband certainly won't be getting the DVD. However despite our varied movie tastes, we both agreed that the young Australian woman Rebel Wilson was a stand-out in this otherwise very Hollywood film. She was funny, charismatic and absolute engaging. What an amazing career she has had since she wowed the world with basically two small scenes in the earlier film Bridesmaids. However, it needs to be asked were the constant fat jokes and bullying taunts really necessary? According to the IMD base website, she improvised most of her scenes proving that she is true comedic talent that can hold her own amongst the A listers. Despite this, her character was called ""Fat Amy"" and the taunts about her size continued from there.

"not the most inventive feature, yet a good showing overall","Energetic comedy about the ups and downs of an all-female collegiate a cappella group. Seeking redemption following a humiliating incident from the previous year, the Barden Bellas recruit heavily to try and return to form, and more importantly upstage their shared university, all-male rival group the Treblemakers. Newly arrived freshman Beca Mitchell, a rebellious and introverted loner whose father is on the teaching staff, likes music but not singing. Against her better judgment she auditions to join the Bellas, but whether she can fit in and conform to their strict, traditional regiment remains to be seen. It's not hard to figure out the trajectory of this film, but it's elevated by likable characters, good casting, laugh-out loud humor, colorful lines, and of course some fantastic musical numbers. Good entertainment if you can get past the familiarity of it all. ***",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A formulaic but entertaining comedy with toe-tapping musical numbers.,"Pitch Perfect is a winning musical comedy. The lovely Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a girl studying at Barden College who wants to become a music producer. After some pressure from her professor father she joins the all-girl a capella group The Bellas. When going to see this film I didn't know what to expect. But to my surprise the music scenes here turned out to be very entertaining. A good deal of humor is milked from a capella singing. The soundtrack consists of catchy old & new hits including tracks by Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Kelly Clarkson, Salt-N-Pepa, Madonna and Toni Basil. The characterization too is strong, and Beca is only one of several characters with a distinct personality. Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy is full of humor. Brittany Snow plays Chloe, a good girl who persuades Beca to try a capella singing in a funny scene in a shower room. Director Jason Moore and the producers (including Elizabeth Banks) tried to make the film hip & cool and they sure did succeed. The director and the cast promoted the film, and I recommend that you see their interviews on the internet. In conclusion, Pitch Perfect is one of the funniest films of the year. It's fresh and I definitely recommend seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Mildly Amusing,"In Pitch Perfect director Jason Moore makes and attempt to step away from the small screen (e.g. Dawson's Creek, Everwood) and onto the big screen with this very predictable and mildly entertaining film. I really wanted this film to be funnier than it was. All the good parts were depicted in the trailer, so there is really not a whole lot forward to. The one scene in the trailer that did not make the cut was the car wash scene (which I thought would have been hilarious). There was some repetitiveness that made me think, ""not this song again"". The story centers on a singing competition of a Capella groups. The girls group contains mean girls, weird girls, crazy girls and girls of all shapes and sizes. The film is mostly about an aspiring DJ, Beca (Anna Kendrick) whose dream it is to ultimately move to Los Angeles and fulfill her dreams; however she must become more socially involved in order to do this. So she decides to give the Barden Bellas a shot. By far the standout in this film is Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson). She is the reason that I wanted to see this film in the first place and she did not disappoint. Rebel was on the Ellen show earlier this week and I have to say that she is hilarious. There are some people who and act funny and then there are people who are funny; she is the latter. She first caught my eye when she played Brynn in Bridesmaid. Jesse (Skylar Astin) and Beca's roller-coaster relationship adds a little more content to the film and depicts a typical college relationship. Best friends Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (Anna Camp) are responsible for assembling a new team for the upcoming school year. Aubrey is quickly stamped as the mean girl and has some serious issues in this film. I was surprised to see Donald Faison in this film. I was like, ""hey, that's the guy from Scrubs"". I do not think that Pitch Perfect was a bad film. I think that the teens out there will actually enjoy this film and can probably relate to it. Also, some of the music numbers were really good. It just didn't have enough substance for me. With all that being said, I am not sure that this film is worth the price of a ticket. I am going to give this film an amber light.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"I didn't hate it, but...","What if your only goal in attending college was to appease your father so he'll subsidize your true ambitions? Would you simply slack off and plan the future you really want? Or would you find a group of students anxious to have you and stick it out?During the opening scene of the film, we're introduced to the Bellas, an all-girl a capella group from the fictional Barden College who are performing at Lincoln Center. During a solo, Aubrey (played by Anna Camp) vomits on stage and turns the Bellas into a national joke. The following semester, new student Beca Mitchell (played by Anna Kendrick) meets Aubrey (Camp) and Chloe (played by Brittany Snow) who are desperate to rebound from their previous embarrassment. Becca (Kendrick), however, is only biding time in college to please her father while composing mash-ups on the laptop in her dorm room. Conversely, Fat Amy (played by Australian comedic actress Rebel Wilson) is confident in her singing ability and anxious to join the Bellas, who used to be composed solely of traditionally beautiful co-eds with vocal talent. Then, while singing in the shower, Beca's talent is discovered by her dorm-mate Chloe. While Beca is noticeably unnerved by the uninvited presence of another nude member of the student body, Chloe refuses to leave until Beca joins her in song. After discovering the fact that Becca has yet to attend a single class, her father (a professor at Barden played by John Benjamin Hickey) tells her that if she wants him to pay her way to Los Angeles she must attend her classes and join at least one student organization. Despite performing Cups at her audition, Beca's invited to join the Bellas along with Fat Amy and the nearly inaudible Lily (played by Hana Mae Lee). And so began a new season for the Bellas under the dictatorial direction the veteran performer with a nervous stomach, Aubrey.Now, I wasn't expecting much a movie intent on lampooning something whose ridiculous nature is pretty self-evident. Still, there were things about it that I liked. Beca's unfiltered contempt for college clichés and the majority of the student body inspires a lot of laughs. At the same time, the gross-out factor is in full-effect during this music- oriented comedy and I don't really care for that kind of humor. Also, Beca's rejection of Jesse (a kindhearted coworker at the campus radio station played by Skylar Astin) wear thin long before she relents. Since the problem I have with this film is essentially the same as the one I had with Bridesmaids, I'll give it the same score.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Where were their Oscars?,"It has been over ten years since the first Pitch Perfect film was released and the world is still feeling the shockwaves.Society was not the same: young girls were performing the Cup Song in every school talent show.

We do not truly appreciate the cultural impact this movie had.Anna Kendrick performed the role of a life time. I've watched the film she got her Oscar nomination from (Up in the Air) and she only put a fraction of her effort into that role that she did for Beca Mitchell but the awards people paid her dust! She doesn't need them anyway, she will be remembered for this.Rebel Wilson will never be forgot either. Coming up with iconic lines like 'mermaid dancing...it's a lot of floorwork' and 'at least it's not herpes' on the spot was just so powerful. The award winners that year could only wish they could do that.If you haven't attempted the choreography from the performances with your cousins then your family has never known true happiness.Say what you want about this film but you can't deny it was an absolute hit with shockwaves propagating everywhere and we still feel them to this day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Pitch Perfect was an enjoyably slight musical drama,"I got very interested in watching this movie when I found out, here on IMDb, it was shot on the LSU campus here in Baton Rouge which my movie theatre-working friend didn't know about till I told him just before the matinée. We both recognized some landmarks from that university when they showed on screen and I myself recognized some drinks from a local hangout named Zippy's (though I have yet to go there) and a sign for Kean's was also prominently featured (though that's a local chain of dry cleaners, not gas stations as in the movie). Anyway, I noticed players like Brittany Snow, Donald Faison, that woman playing Fat Amy from Bridesmaides, and John Michael Higgins with Elizabeth Smart as those funny commentators. They and the unknowns were good though the script was pretty slight concerning some plot points and I thought the vomiting of one of the main characters was a bit much. Still, I mostly enjoyed the singing of mash-ups and the using of that teen movie The Breakfast Club as another plot point. So on that note, I recommended Pitch Perfect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Pitch Perfect- ""Acca-amazing!""","""Acca-hilarious!"" Pitch Perfect taking acapella to a new level of competition. Who ever knew that acapella groups even existed before this film? These types of groups make show choir seem amateur. The Bellas, an all-girls singing group, changes when all was lost at the last year's competition and needs to find new, yet talented singers. As you watch the comedic scenes of trying to 'stabilize' the new members, major characters will definitely not be forgotten because of their funny ways.Beca, an aspiring disc jockey, stumbles upon the world of acapella. While her father forces a college education upon her, she starts to see how she can incorporate her talent to her new life-changing experience. Beginning a new life chapter, she leads us to great characters and a romantic, Romeo and Juliet type of situation.Rebel Wilson a.k.a. ""Fat Amy,"" gives the film great humor. Other characters like, Lily the quiet Asian to Cynthia the lesbian can't compare to Wilson's character. The film would not be complete enough without the antics of ""Fat Amy."" Her interjections within scenes are too die for and you will just have to watch it to understand. Along with that, Lily while being a 'stereotypical' depiction of Asians, being quiet makes her character funny without saying. Get it? Without saying? Anyways, when watching this film, these characters will definitely get laughter in the air. No doubt about it.As the original Bellas, Chloe and Aubrey try to figure out how to work with their new members of the Bellas. Chloe and Aubrey are both portraying two blonde stuck up girls who think they are both better than everyone else. It is quite funny to see how they go from all thin 'perfect' girls to 'different' yet somewhat talented girls. This type of portrayal makes it stereotypical and hilarious to watch when they see what the ending results are for their new group.Throughout the film, music is definitely the other element of this film connected to comedy. The Bellas, known for their old school ways, Aubrey continues this idea. Beca, a new Bella, can see right away that it is time for change. Sometimes old school is good, but this time around it just wasn't cutting it. The scenes of tension and trying to deal with the new group are too funny. Music definitely gave it an 'humph' and transitioning from old school to present day music is very hard to accept at times. Although, old school music is always good and all you really need to do is add a little bit of surprise and comedy.With this type of film, the actresses exceeded the expectations of comedy. And the talent is unbelievable. So for anyone who is a music addict or just wanting a good laugh with some music pizazz, this film is definitely it. You have to remember that, comedy plus romance and multiply it with music will always make it worth your while. Well at least for me it did.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Pitch Perfect (2012) - Get Pitch Slapped!,"""Pitch Perfect"" is that rare movie where by seeing the trailer, you can probably already tell that it's going to be one of those ""Step Up""-type movies, following the predictable and formulaic storyline of competitive groups of a certain activity. Only this time, it involves professional singing. The movie stars Anna Kendrick stars as a young freshman at her new university who enjoys remixing music on her laptop, creating new and original fresh beats. She ends up joining this all-female acapella group that always sings the same boring songs over and over in almost every competition. In order to defeat a group of all-male acapella singers, Anna Kendrick is here to make everything more hip and edgy, giving more newer and fresher songs to the beat. Now, we have our movie filled with impressive acapella singing. I'm not really the demographic for these movies, so I had plenty of doubts before watching. But, as it turns out, I surprisingly had a real fun time with this movie. There are tons of great songs that made me tap my feet and sing along to. It's an entertaining film that knows it's general audience really well. Anna Kendrick is a great actress, and is always super likable in every film she's in. She's also really likable in this film, and she shines in nearly every scene, with her great singing talent to go along with it. Although this movie still does follow the formulaic romance plot, Kendrick delivers decent chemistry with Skylar Astin, a.k.a. ""the Dane Cook look-a-like"", who is very likable as a guy who dreams of being a movie composer, and falls for Kendrick after showing her the final scene in ""The Breakfast Club"". Those references to the film alone made me smile a lot. The film can either go any direction in the comedy department, at times it can be very funny, while some jokes fall flat. But the movie does have some entertaining musical numbers to help back up the film's quick 112-minute pace. Now, ""Pitch Perfect"" does suffer from a few gags involving projectile vomiting that wasn't really funny, a few annoying ""d-bag"" characters, and sometimes it gets really obnoxious when characters would often add the word ""aca-"" (prefix of ""acapella"") to almost every sentence. Although sharing a few funny lines, Rebel Wilson, who plays a character that decides to call herself ""Fat Amy"", so others won't say it behind her back, is sadly given little to say or do for the majority of the film. She sadly felt wasted in the film, and I expected more screen time from her. I also still stand by my opinion that the movie still has the formulaic plot told a thousand times before, knowing each certain plot point coming a mile away. However, ""Pitch Perfect"" is still a very enjoyable movie with fun musical numbers, great song, a likable performance from Anna Kendrick, and a few funny moments from here and there. I still wished that some problems could have been fixed, but overall, ""Pitch Perfect"" was a huge surprise, and it really wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. ""Pitch Perfect"", in my review, ""undeniably fun, but nothing remarkable"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"It was fun, whether i wanted it to be or not...","I hate Glee type of movies. Same story, same characters, same perfect improvisational abilities every average teen has (?!?). This movie doesn't differentiate much from the picture, but, somehow i can't give it less than 7/10.OK, the plot is not very innovative, we have the cliché romance string and most of the characters in this movie are generic, but what happened here is that we have a leading female role which is not at all your typical chick. Although many people see and understand her as an 'alternative' girl (she is portrayed like by other characters), she is just an ordinary girl, somewhat socially awkward, trying to follow her dream. Not at all dramatic as an 'alt' person could be, and definitely not emphasizing that what she is. To be said, she doesn't even listen to 'alternative' music, which is a thing that somehow bothers me. If she doesn't listen to that kind of music, doesn't really act like she does, but tries to look like she does, we have a case of a badly put together character. They made her 'alternative' just for the sake of it... Anyways... A bit phlegmatic, she wouldn't fit the role in, let's say, Bring It On, but, she does fit this flick perfectly. Other characters were a variety of templates. The Bellas' leader Audrey and The Treblemakers' leader Bumper were the queen and the king of the cliché, but somehow i got to connect with Audrey. Others like Fat Amy and Lilly were refreshing.I am a musician so this affects me heavily. I HATE the performances of all of groups!! They jump all around the stage and have like the perfectest pitch. It just bothered me to the point i had to sustain myself from skipping the scenes. Not to mention they are auto-tuned to the max. Unless they all had Melodyne in their mics, which they didn't, i find it wrong, unrealistic, even utopistic. And yes, this is where the perfect improvisation skills fall into. You just can't improvise if you don't know the song at all, and if you can, you are a godly talented chap, but the rest of your singing group sure aren't clones of yours. And this is generally what i hate about music movies. You can't convince me if you make mistakes like this. I don't believe anyone could enjoy their 'live' performances when they sound so unnatural.At last, i find John and Geil highly inappropriate and not at all funny.When i read my review i feel like i've given this movie a negative grade, but it actually made me laugh from time to time, i found some of the characters appealing and the overall impression it left after watching it was positive, so, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Happily surprised, LOVED IT! Funny, clever.","MUCH BETTER than I expected. Received preview ticket, and went reluctantly, braced for a shallow, mean, trite and petty movie. (Sorry! Maybe the photo or writeup on the ticket misled me...) I'm a frumpy, conservative adult. But I very much love music as a teacher, consumer, and performer. I GRINNED throughout the entire movie. The rating is fair, though movie does border on R, so be warned. The MUSIC is up and fun. This is not a musical in the sense people talk to each other in songs. It has a LOT of singing, partly because people that like to sing are with people that like to sing, so they SING. If you've been on a bus headed to camp, and joined in a song, you know how that can happen. The script just built in a lot of opportunities to sing. The dialog is snappy and clever. Characters are stereotyped artfully and quickly, allowing the banter to zing along and entertain with breathtakingly little setup. Just enough explanation is given to account for motive, even regarding the ""mean"" behavior, and make it understandable. ""My Cousin Vinney"" has no ""villains"", and in the end maybe the same can be said here. The only movie in my limited experience I'd compare it to is ""She's All That"", because it is at school, there is a pretty, talented, aloof main female character (here, Anna Kendrick), some romantic suspense, few adults anywhere to be seen, and it lands on its feet. But compared to ""She's All That"", ""Pitch Perfect"" moves quicker -- it is lighter on its feet ---, has more interesting, likable characters, and is LOADED with entertaining performances---song and choreography --- which are pitched too perfect to be live, but presented in movie form in a way that is bound to delight and energize.

Men WILL also be entertained,"Coming in to this movie I couldn't help but think: Is this gonna be another cheesy chick flick? Well, it is.

I can say I thoroughly enjoyed most of the movie and thought some of the characters were actually pretty realistic. And these girls are HOOOOT (Fat Amy OMG)! The downside of the movie is pretty much that it is basically a chick flick and therefore intended for the feminine side. Also, some things escalate pretty quickly, like Anna Kendricks kind of transition from being the hot dark hot topic type girl to being the hot A Capella singer.

The Pitch is quite perfect but the story is plain and boring...,"Watched this movie last week, it's not a musical but a movie about transformation of Barden's Bella acapella team. This movie actually has the potential, all the girls has their own background which means there are several side stories which could make it more interesting, ie about Aubrey, why she throws up when she stress, the sex-maniac Stacie, or about Fat Amy, a fat girl but seems very popular among handsome men. But it's focus on Beca's life which I think it's just plain and dull. This make the scenes between those fine acapella composition passable.The acapella compositions on the final are good but it's not as exciting as the riff-off scene.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Worse than expected. And I didn't expect much.,"OK, I expected Pitch Perfect to be stupid, but I did NOT expect all the trite homophobia. The one gay character (only one? In a film about acapella singing?) is a sexual predator who preys on straight people. Which is NOT a joke even though everyone seems to think it's hilarious. That character is like a gay stereotype from the 1940s. Roy Moore would approve.But the worst thing about this film is the singing. OF COURSE they're pitch perfect because they're autotuned to high heaven. It hurt my ears. And my soul. There wasn't a single human-sounding note in the entire film. Plus, I kept watching the choreography thinking they were messing it up on purpose and that they'd tighten it up by the end. But no. They just couldn't do it. And the choreo stank, BTW.

So far I've liked every Anna Kendrick movie that I've seen (although I haven't seen every movie of hers).Having seen this movie, as well as ""Glee"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"", I can conclude that jukebox musicals are productions featuring songs spoofed by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. I hope that one day there's a jukebox musical featuring his parodies of pop songs. Undeniably, such a production would have to be an over-the-top slapstick comedy.Anyway, fun movie. That guy definitely WAS a misogynist.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Pitch Perfect,10/10 - the best movie ever made (at least in my opinion) and a fantastic introduction to comedic powerhouses Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson.,10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
More Glee-like than it's willing to admit.,"Pitch Perfect wants to be Glee plus Easy A, but it's more Glee than it wants to admit. Littered with high school clichés in a college environment, it's surprising that it's more endearing than I thought it could be. The most pleasant surprise is that Anna Kendrick is a great lead. She does a charming job of holding the film on her shoulders when I've only seen her in light supporting roles. However, I did struggle to buy the main premise of the film. They wanted her character to be apathetic to the whole acapella thing but it can't be that hard to ignore that self-aware fad, right? Oh well, this isn't a film that really concerns itself with that. Instead it's half-catchy covers and remixes of popular songs I don't know with a half-assed tribute to 80s movies rammed in there. There's good intentions so it isn't too irritating. Rebel Wilson and Elizabeth Banks steal the show with the best lines. The three actresses totally make it worth watching. But it's overall mild entertainment with an occasional edge to its humour.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"This movie is nothing but FUN, FUN, FUN!!!","This is probably the best comedy film of 2012, it's irresistible, it's effective, it's funny, it's lovable, it's relating and it's entertaining. From beginning to end, the movie never fails to make its audience laugh and smile, with it's usual and cheeky scenarios, people can actually relate easily from the film. This is indeed, one of the best musical-comedy of all time. If you know the songs from the film, you might even sing along with it and even if you don't want to, you can feel the urge to join them clap and make beats with their hands. The movie delivers short punch lines that gives you exceeding laughter. I, myself, can't help but make noise while hooked in its punch lines.Rebel Wilson, probably, is the perfect ingredient in the film. Her undeniably crazy aura brings more spice and kick to the film. I love the combination of different characters with different attitudes and personality, it gives the movie more color and life. The different personalities of the character gives the audience a wider perspective and story, it also makes the characters fun to watch and once you see these characters, it gets even more interesting. It's a good thing this film doesn't focus on the lead role too much and leaves enough space for other characters to fill in.This film also gives you a full dose of musical entertainment that will make you run to the record store and buy the soundtrack right away.Unlike other musical films and chick flicks, where women are usually the baddies, in this film, the guys are the baddies influenced by one of the characters, Bumper. I think that's a good change and a right turn. It's also good that in the film, the two competing groups are not trying to bring each other down by sabotaging each other all the time unlike what happens in most chick flicks.I definitely enjoyed the film throughout, I have nothing to complain about it, in every corner, it is perfect.

"Singing, dancing, and general hilarity","Last night I saw an advanced screening of Pitch Perfect in Atlanta, and it was amazing! The singing and dancing done by the different groups was really great, and I thought it really portrayed the dynamic within the a capella group very well, along with the competition between girls' and boys' groups at the same school.I was honestly not expecting it to be as hilarious as it was. Rebel Wilson of Bridesmaids fame had the greatest one-liners, and almost every word out of Hanna Mae Lee's mouth made me laugh. Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins had that super snarky, bitingly bitter air that you imagine commentators having, playing off of each other weirdly and perfectly.I was a little disappointed by the story lines: it felt like they tried to introduce some of the cliché Hollywood story lines to flesh the movie out, but abandoned them halfway through. But that didn't even occur to me until after, since I was so dazzled by the amazing singing and dancing--which is what the movie is really all about. If they had to sacrifice one for the other, I'm glad they focused on the musical numbers, because it's great to see these great singers and actors really perform and entertain.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Where's the musical?,"Lots of fans could hardly wait for the sequel to come out, and now that it's here, I went back and watched PP again to see if I missed something. Nope, all that junk is still there. I was hoping to see a musical, but a vapid teen/college comedy showed up instead with a sprinkling of ""music"" in it. Most of the major roles were occupied by actors closer to 30 than college age at the time the movie was made. The music is spotty, at best, and the lip-syncing/dubbing is terrible. A lot of ""fat girls are funny"" humor involving Rebel Wilson's character (can she actually do comedy, or just Funny Fat Girl stuff?) And when they resort to vomit humor more than once, you know a movie is short on writing talent. The only bright spot is Anna Kendrick, and her solo with that coffee mug. I can hardly wait for PP2 to come out - - - at the $2 video rental box, it's a sequel I can wait for....",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Chix Chat on Film Review: A capella funfest.,"This film shows yet again that anything and everything can be a competition. I have never even thought about a capella singing as a competition, but once I saw the trailer for Pitch Perfect I was immediately interested because of the No Diggity cover. This film just seemed like Bring It On with no cheerleaders, the whole tryout, outlandish rules and the build to the Super Bowl of a capella. The story centers around the freshman year of college for Beca (Anna Kendrick), who is less than thrilled to be on campus. Primarily due to the fact that her Dad is on staff, so we have a sub story of daddy issues, which brought a bit of drama into this comedy. I will say that Ms. Kendrick is a bit of a chameleon, to play a student after playing a business woman in Up In The Air and she can sing. I actually Googled to see if she was lip syncing, she sings. The Treble Makers cover of the Dazz Band's Whip It, was the worse version of the song imaginable. But the Treble Makers were very good at what they did, singing. The film had some really good a capella singing and since the majority of the story was in competition or preparing for competition there was inevitably judging. The banter between the judges Gail (Elizabeth Banks) and John (John Michael Higgins) was too funny mostly because of the clear disdain for each other. There were several players in this film that stood out for various reasons. Chloe (Brittany Snow) and Aubrey (Anna Camp) looked too old to be college students even if they were seniors. Fat Patricia (Rebel Wilson) just kept the funny coming. I didn't realize in what film I had previously seen Ms. Wilson until almost the end of the film that she was in Bridesmaids. I'm sure she will do great things after this, she's very funny and more than anything she seems very comfortable in her own skin. I liked the fact that they didn't do the whole Stomp The Yard final competition and make it a tie, but clearly the story ended with more to tell. I wanted more substance and less regurgitation. After I waited for my No Diggity and it was done, I just didn't have a whole lot to look forward to. This was a fun film, it wasn't bad, so I give it an amber light.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Also, I like the main character starts singing with using a cup on the stage at the audition.

Best musical ever,"I haven't seen a movie with such great music, likable characters,ever. Add into that, the movie is hilarious, it will surely win your heart. If you love music, you need to see this. If you love just great movies, this is one that slipped your attention, and you won't regret watching this movie. You'll find yourself laughing, dancing, and enjoying cinema in the way it should be loved. The movie truly succeeds when it lets go and let's the music do the storytelling. The movie mixes new music with some older stuff which should appeal to all. Anna Kendrick steals the attention with every scene and is very likable and relatable. To the fans of the sing off show that was prematurely cancelled, wondering if the singing is on par with what was on the show? You won't be disappointed. The movie mixes romance, comedy and just plain fun to give one a very enjoyable hour 52 minutes well spent.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Pitch Not So Perfect,Pitch Perfect was an overall decent musical comedy. The hype and reviews for this definitely are way higher than it actually is but regardless I enjoyed it. The story itself is unique and hasn't necessarily been done before which is refreshing. Just seeing a bunch of singing groups go about their college life had it's funny moments. It was very predictable and obvious what was going to happen but even still I wasn't reasonably engaged and had a few laughs. Some of the singing was a little too much for me but sometimes it was pretty good. Overall it's a good watch for most and worth putting it on.,6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
New Cult Classic,"This is a movie when you are sick and take look at your DVD's you will pick out and watch to feel better. It is in the range of Sister Act and High School Musical, movies you definitely watch more than once. Anna Kendrick carries the movie with ease and leaves enough room for the rest to blossom. The singing is pretty good, Brittney Snow an Anna stand out for me. The ""Just the way you are"" clip is on youtube and will give you a good impression. Off course there's a girl meets boy story in it, there should be. A nice guy is hitting on here and she let's him in one bit at a time. Simple and well written imho. The final performance you have to watch and listen more than once to understand all the detail and appreciate the arrangement. There's only one disturbing thing in the movie and that's way to much puke, way over the top.

Pitch Perfect Review,"Just a girl with a dream to keep to herself and her music. All she needs in life is to get done with college and find a job composing music, working with what she loves. However, this becomes more of a challenge than expected for Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) who ironically runs into a group of girls who are compiled of complete opposites, but yet at the same time, these girls are more similar to each other than any of them could have ever imagined. Directed by Jason Moore, Pitch Perfect creates an ""acca-amazing"" film that has its viewers hooked from the first a cappella performance, building climactically through each musical number , revealing new friendships and relationships, all comically displayed; don't be surprised, even the least musically inclined few may be astounded to find themselves singing along with this hysterical uproar.When Beca arrives at Barden University with no expectations, looking for a place to just fit in, she comes across the Barden Bella's a cappella group. With reservation, she participates in practices and performances all while fighting off the charming new freshman, Jesse (Skylar Astin), part of the all male, rivalry, a cappella group, the Treblemakers. While the Barden Bellas aren't exactly your typical ""pretty-girl"" group, the diversity adds to the laugh-out-loud humor that appears to be present throughout the entire film.To Moore's credit, Pitch Perfect isn't simply a remake of the popular TV show, Glee. Originality abounds in this admired film, creating its own storyline unique to the industry. Besides the fact that the music is completely brilliant (because who doesn't love elegant, beautiful harmony) , writer Kay Cannon deserves a standing ovation for crafting this masterpiece with strategic humor and a legitimate plot.To be sure not to exclude, much credit also is due to the acting; especially by Rebel Wilson who plays Fat Amy, called such a name ""so twig bitches like you don't do it behind my back"". Wilson is the primary source of laughter in this movie and never ceases to amaze her audience in providing good, clean, humorous entertainment. She is essentially the comedic relief to an already amusing film. Similarly, Benji (played by Ben Platt), originally denied from the Treblemakers because of his obsession with magic and Star Wars, adds to the movie with his quirkiness. It seems that every cast member seems to fit in perfectly and was excellently selected by Moore.Pitch Perfect may possibly be one of the more unique, comical productions of 2012. With its originality played out perfectly and its musical accents throughout the film, it will have viewers running right back to watch it again. An outstanding combination of this and the well- casted, phenomenal acting, Moore earns himself five stars from this ""acca-awesome"" movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Geeky Randy's summary,"The Barden Bellas, a female a-cappella group, add University freshman Kendrick to the club, but she brings with her a creative freedom demand that is much needed but might tear them all apart; however, they'll have to agree on something if they hope to stand a chance against their male rivals in a campus competition. The ensemble cast delivers excellently in both acting and singing, and the musical choices are quite sound (pun?). Worthy date-night movie, but all the laughs are targeted to the female viewer. The hypocrisy of Kendrick ranting about how predictable movies are is quite a turn off, considering how textbook the unfolding of this story is.

PITCH PERFECT music is a-ca-dorable but movie a-ca-in't,"An aca-musical treat to the ears.

Apart from these I was jubilant to listen to acapellas of 500 miles and Final Countdown. ""Cups"" song took me spellbound. Among the actors I pick Fat Amy's Character, who hit the correct aca-note every time on screen. On the aca-negative part, I couldn't believe myself of viewing the movie for a-ca-lmost 2 hours because of aca-amazing songs but still sucked at multiple aca-levels. Comical elements are rusted and seen many time before in earlier movies. I hated the makeup, they were too unreal and all female actors looked like Barbie dolls.

Hmmm...,"Actually, I did not know what kind of a movie this is... I knew Anna's name from the Billboard charts but nothing else.

The main girl - Beca was too reminiscent ( name and appearance) of Bella from the Twilight saga. Her love interest is kinda too similar to American Pie boy. I don't know if it just for me similar or it was intentional.All in all, the film is OK. Kinda funny, not boring. Good to pass the evening while there is storm outside.So, there is the follow-up...

Surprisingly good...,"""Pitch Perfect"" is a Comedy - Music and the first movie of the ""Pitch Perfect"" franchise, in which we watch a freshman at Barden University joining a singing group. She does her best for the group and help them in order to compete in a campus competition.I found this movie nice because it had a simple plot that was easy to follow, something that gave us time to enjoy the songs. The direction which was made by Jason Moore was good and the interpretations of Anna Kendrick who played as Beca, Anna Camp who played as Aubrey, Rebel Wilson who played as Fat Amy and Brittany Snow who played as Chloe were very good. For me Rebel Wilson was the best since she was simply hilarious and she made the difference in this movie. To sum up, I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie and I was really surprised that I actually enjoyed it.

The pitch was alright,"This movie was about a capella singing so I can't say it was something I thought I'd enjoy but honestly it wasn't that bad. The singing was really good and I really enjoyed every treblemaker song. The humour was really really hit or miss throughout the whole film. Some of the jokes were unbearably and just downright awful, mostly to do with those presenters. Occasionally they were kinda funny. Some of the dialogue is really awful and the use of aca before every word was excruciatingly painful.

Way different from other Musical Movies!!!Looking forward to second part!!!,"Beca (Anna Kendrick) is that girl who'd rather listen to what's coming out of her headphones than what's coming out of you. Arriving at her new college, she finds herself not right for any clique but somehow is muscled into one that she never would have picked on her own: alongside mean girls, sweet girls and weird girls whose only thing in common is how good they sound when they sing together, in the new out-loud comedy Pitch Perfect. When Beca takes this acoustic singing group out of their world of traditional arrangements and perfect harmonies into all-new mash-ups, they fight to climb their way to the top of the cutthroat world of college a cappella. This could wind up either the coolest thing they'll ever do or the most insane, and it will probably be a little of both.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Loved it,"The previews of this movie is completely in line with what you would expect. Fat Amy was hilarious in the movie and the character made the movie go from serious to a comedy. I loved the Bella's that reminded me so much of the southern classy women that are prim and proper. Then, Anna Kendricks character comes into play and is the modern hipster. She remixes a lot of music and I immediately went and purchased the album. There are so many great songs that are covered in the song. My Favorite is the rule the world from the classics in the 80's. This made me feel like this movie was the modern day Breakfast Club with a slight twist. I was shocked about how amazing the voices were in the movie. I had no idea these actors had such amazing voices. Honestly, i walked away with some crushes in the movie. Well worth going to see and can't wait to purchase this on DVD. I will be doing that asap.

"""The ending is the best part""","The quote which is the title of the review is repeated only twice in the whole movie, but serves as an adequate summary of my opinion of it. Another appropriate title would be ""Sing 'aaahhh' on three."" As the discussion between our main characters Jesse and Beca goes, the endings of a lot of movies (even, apparently, The Empire Strikes Back) are predictable, but the ending is the best part nevertheless. The ending of this movie is obvious from the second Beca and Jesse are introduced, right down to the fact that the final sentence is never completed. But nevertheless, the ending is the best part. The final 30 minutes of this movie make the tortuous parts of the first eighty minutes worth watching.

The very beginning of the movie is mesmerizing and the next moment you are into the film. Audition scene of Beca(played by Anna Kendrick) is simply outstanding. It would have taken good practice to master the voice-over singing and the girls were excellent at it. Hats off to the director for choosing a challenging script and directing to the perfection. Story is simple but it is the script and performances which makes it watching at least more than once. Anna Kendrick gives another stupendous performance.

"Great music, so-so story","First off, I'll admit to not being a fan of GLEE and I don't really get the fascination with acappella. It's just singing without instruments, and the most fun I can see people having with it is as a novelty. Still, I decided to check out PITCH PERFECT and see what all the fuss was about. My general impression was that the musical numbers were pretty good across the board, and quite creative. Everything else just kind of drags it down a bit. The basic plot is that an all-girl college acappella group is trying to redeem themselves after an embarrassing loss at the last year's finals. It also served as an opportunity for a diverse group of girls, who normally wouldn't be together, to get to know each other and become friends. The cast isn't really filled with a lot of recognizable faces, but they all give decent performances. Still, the lack of character depth is apparent and none of them really approach anything past caricatures. Everyone has a couple of characteristics or quirks that get mined for laughs throughout the whole movie, and it did get old after a while. Plot-wise, no new ground was broken either. Everything happens exactly how you expect it to, complete with a last-minute crisis that gets resolved a little too quickly and cleanly. And really, outside of that there really isn't any conflict or reason to care about any of the characters. Still, the musical numbers are quite impressive, and the only reason I'm rating this as high as I am. While the core group, the Barden Bellas, stick to the same songs for the most of the movie, only changing up their act in the final part of the movie, everyone else varies their material and gives it a nice touch. There are a wide variety of songs chosen, and they're performed in visually interesting ways and have good choreography as well. The contemporary soundtrack was also quite good too. Overall, I thought the movie was OK, but nothing to rave about. Despite the great soundtrack and musical performances, the plot is rote and the characters all one-note. It isn't horrible by any stretch, but the only reason to see it is for the music or if you're a GLEE fan.",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Kendrick disappoints but the supporting cast carries this movie.,"Pitch Perfect was genuinely funny and didn't take itself too seriously. The musical arrangements were actually pretty decent though and the comedic elements were not traditional at all making them even more humorous. The only things that hold hack the film, in my opinion, are the generic plot and Anna Kendrick's lack of any charisma whatsoever. The plot is the exact same as almost every single other music, dance, etc. movie made in the last decade: Protagonist joins team/club/group that is struggling, they go through bumps along the way, protagonist either quits or comes close to quitting, protagonist gives it one last go and helps the team/club/group achieve their ultimate goal all while experiencing relationship issues throughout. As for Anna Kendrick, I think this movie showed that, while she's talented, she's not capable of being the focus of any movie. Characters like Fat Amy distract the audience from Kendrick's utter lack of charisma or charm. Honestly, her character is one of the least interesting characters in the entire film. Regardless, this movie is still worth watching because of the humor alone and the musical arrangements are a nice bonus.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Lucky for me, Amazon Prime had it included with the subscription and even with the french dub, altough i think it was a France dub due to some term used.In any case i decided to watch it today because i spot a bluray of the first on ebay on sale rather cheap and i wanted to know if it was worth buying or would i just resale 2 and 3 when i would had watch them.Turn out the movie was actually good fun. I am not really the demographic for this as i am not really into musicals usually but i do love an university comedy and altough the emphasis is obviously on the music, the characters were fun and it had some good jokes.

"Acapella can be cool, too.","Bellas seems strongly bonded along the time. I'm not sure it's because the movie clearly portrays character development or because they were really close during the shooting, but I can feel that bond through the screen, meaning their harmony is convincing enough.

"Pitch Perfect, an exciting movie","Pitch Perfect is a comedy film about a feminine music group who sing a cappella. The principal plot is about how this group reach the top of the national a cappella competition. The film has also a romantic plot but it is secondary unlike other movies of this kind.The film is a parody of the clichéd way of life in American universities and the typical a cappella bands that we see in other films such as High School Musical. It is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen, it make you laugh until one cries.It's a surprising movie too because you see it without any expectations or with expectations to watch a typical teenager film and it turn out to be exciting. It has a great cinematographic quality with impressive performances of the leading actress, Anna Kendrick, and Rebel Wilson who played the role of Fat Amy that is hands down the best character in the movie.The songs that are singed during all the film are perfectly chosen and they fit in adequately with the plot. After watching it, you sing the songs constantly, you are not able to stop singing them.In my point of view is a gripping movie that makes you laugh and spend a nice time. I would highly recommend you to see that film if you have a chance and if you like comedy films, it would not disappoint you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A Harmony of Hilarity and Heart that Strikes the Perfect Chord in Musical,"Jason Moore is the director of the musical comedy Pitch Perfect, which stars Anna Kendrick and an impressive ensemble. The movie centers on Beca, a freshman at college who reluctantly decides to join the Barden Bellas a cappella club. With their unique personalities and comic timing, the group captivates the audience with their exceptional performances. Highlights include the musical arrangements, which are lively due to the variety of tunes and mashups used. Pitch Perfect emphasizes friendship, acceptance, and discovering one's voice while striking a healthy balance between genuine moments of camaraderie and self-discovery and humor. With its celebration of music, friendship, and individuality, the movie stands out among its genre's offerings and appeals to a wide age range of viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Good Music and Anna Kendric has a Great Smile,"The plot was not mind blowing, they might have lip synced, it was not that funny, and the comedy, you can see it coming, but as far as I'm concerned, that is all secondary.The music was great. When you combine the music with Anna Kendrick's smile which rocks the screen about 70% of the movie, it makes it a good experience. Anna has the smile of a model, similar to Jennifer Connelly's devastating smile.By the way, despite her smile, Anna is not the sexiest woman up on the screen. Alexis Knapp, who plays Stacie Conrad, dominates the screen and any man's attention when she is on it. If you watch this, you will immediately know when Alexis is on screen.The music, well, they hit us with about 70 songs in the movie, and some songs, like the Bruno Mars song ""Just The Way You Are"" were done in a fantastic way. Not to mention that it has some other background songs that are good.And although the movie is not a great comedy, Rebel Wilson has good comedic delivery.The message of the movie is that perseverance, teamwork and being sensitive to others, will be rewarded and this adds to the reason this was a sleeper hit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

love,"Everything about these movies is great. They are so ridiculous and funny. I've seen them multiple times and they just don't get old. My favorite is pitch perfect two. I love that the girls bond at the summer camp and I love Hailee Steinfeld as the new girl. Super sweet and well done on the acting. My favorite characters are fat Amy, Emily, benji. My favorite a cappella groups are the Bella's and the treble makers, I also liked those rocker chicks in the last movie. I loved Jesse. But unfortunately I didn't like Becca all that much. She just seemed winey to me through out the series. All that to say, great mindless movies to watch for a good laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The Vidiot Reviews,"Pitch PerfectOne of the easiest jobs has to be roadying for an a cappella group.Unfortunately the instrument-free group in this comedy only has openings for singers.After a disastrous performance at last year's A Cappella championship, The Bellas are looking for new vocals.Co-founder Chloe's (Brittany Snow) first prospect is aspiring DJ Beca (Anna Kendrick), a freshman with a fresh perspective on music.Also recruited to the underdog squad is high pitch hitter Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson).However, the group's other co-founder (Anna Camp) would rather stick to their 1990s repertoire than allow Beca's 1980s mash-ups to be performed.Despite its numerous missteps into vulgar humour, and its inauthentic attempt at being fashionable, Pitch Perfect does contain more than one comical moment and performance worthy of note.Regrettably, one of the major drawbacks of an all-girl a cappella group is that they have a tendency to sound like harmonized nagging.

A Little Annoying If Comedy Isn't Your Thing,"Somehow, I almost enjoyed Pitch Perfect despite being unable to find amusement in the movie's intended humor. Rebel Wilson's particular comedic niche isn't my cup of tea, so her additions to an already ridiculous movie made Pitch Perfect just tip over the edge to being among slight annoyances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Watch to suit!,"Were we shocked when Jason Moore a musical director was announced as director of Pitch Perfect? Of course not. The story is based on a book but brought to life using Kay Cannon's writing of the screen play and Jason Moore's musical background. Pitch perfect is a teenage comedy with a musical twist (cute, silly and fun). The star character is Beca who joins and a Capella group but has high hopes of becoming a DJ. The film is gripping with ups and downs. Obviously! It has silly goofs, falling, puking and love. Beca is a freshman at Barden University. She Joins the Bellas, an all-girls singing group due to flattery and persuasion. The girls re-energised enter a campus competition against the other groups. The Star of the show is Anna Kendrick playing the beautiful Beca. The funniest character is Rebel Wilson playing fat Amy; revealed to the audience later why she has this nickname.The characters are bubbly with the girls being silly and the guys being bad boys. Of Course! It's a good musical with amazing song choice and no random breaking into song. God that would be annoying!There is no manly action but a lot is happening at any given time. The comedy is different we expect adult humour or clown like humour but what we get is immature childish humour thanks to Rebel Wilson's remarks and improvisation.In Conclusion, I would recommend this film to anyone who's as immature as me if not you will hate it, so don't watch it. I would strongly recommend it if you enjoy childish humour with an adult twist due to some inappropriate language and scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"A fun, toe-tapping, if somewhat flawed film","I know, I'm not the kind of person you would expect to really like Pitch Perfect, seeing that I'm 21, and I'm a guy. But I love music and singing, and with that said, I really enjoy it, as well as both its sequels.The film centers on jaded college freshman Beca Mitchell (played by Anna Kendrick), who is enrolled at Barden University for free, against her will. Beca does not want to be part of any crowd, but her dad, Barden professor Dr. Mitchell (John Benjamin Hickey) cajoles her into joining a student activity in exchange for his agreement to back her dream of becoming a music producer. Beca joins the university's all-girl acapella group, the Barden Bellas, currently co-led by seniors Aubrey Posen (Anna Camp) and Chloe Beale (Brittany Snow), who are determined to return to the ICCA Finals, after suffering a humiliating loss to their all-guy rivals, the Treblemakers, the previous year, when Aubrey accidentally spewed mid-solo. Beca soon finds that between herself, super-conservative Aubrey, civil Chloe, comical Patricia ""Fat Amy"" Hobart (Rebel Wilson), tomboyish Cynthia Rose Adams (Ester Dean), soft-spoken Lily Onakuramara (Hana Mae Lee), and several other girls, the only thing the Bellas have in common is how well they sing together. She pulls the women out of their comfort zone of the traditional arrangements that Aubrey champions, and introduces them to her amazing world of different harmonic combinations, as they scramble to the Finals.Now, let me just say that the characters in this movie are pretty well-written, at least for the most part. Though Beca comes off as stand-offish and aloof, she does mean well, and her heart's in the right place. I love Chloe. She's always open to new ideas, not to mention she's very supportive of Beca, as well as the other Bellas. As for Aubrey, I can't really say the same. Throughout much of the movie, she comes off as really domineering, and constantly insisting that performing the same damn songs over and over is the key to the Bellas' success, when it's just the opposite. Ever hear of ""keep moving forward"", Aubrey? And it honestly makes it that much more satisfying when it takes a mutinous rage-induced brawl among the Bellas to get her to open her eyes and finally loosen up. And yet, she does also make a couple valid points when she chews out Beca for undermining her authority. But Fat Amy is easily my favorite. She says and does some of the funniest things throughout the movie. And though the rest of the Bellas are mostly archetypes, we do get to see a little more of what they have to offer when they all share their secrets. As for Beca's boyfriend, freshman Treblemaker Jesse Swanson (Skylar Astin), he's real charming. Bumper Allen (Adam DeVine), the obnoxious Treblemakers leader, is the amusing kind of jerkish. And Dr. Mitchell is a good father.The acting in this movie is top-notch. Anna Kendrick brings Beca to life with an excellent mix of sarcasm and charm. Brittany Snow is energetic and lovely as Chloe. Anna Camp is fittingly uptight and domineering as Aubrey, and also does a great job showing her loosen up and become more pleasant. But Rebel Wilson absolutely steals the show as Fat Amy. In fact, a lot of why she's so hilarious is that they allowed her to adlib extensively. Skylar Astin is calm, warm and polite as Jesse. Ben Platt is amusingly eccentric as his best friend, Benjamin ""Benji"" Applebaum. Adam DeVine is hysterical as Bumper. And John Benjamin Hickey is pretty good as Dr. Mitchell.The writing is pretty great, too. A lot of this movie's humor is really on-point. Favorite scenes of mine include Bumper nailing Fat Amy with a burrito, with her overreaction being the cherry on top. A lot of Fat Amy's other antics also count. There's also the scene of a completely nude Chloe barging in on Beca's shower to persuade her to audition for the Bellas. So much awkward. But then, there's also humor that DOESN'T land, particularly any scene of Aubrey vomiting. That's honestly more disgusting than funny, particularly the first instance, which just came out of nowhere (though when she TURBO-vomits much later in the movie, Fat Amy's screaming was hilarious). I do have a few other complaints. The climatic scene of the Bellas letting loose towards the end would be more cathartic, had we actually seen all of the Bellas, and not JUST Beca, question Aubrey's leadership. Also, what was the deal with Beca's Korean roommate, Kimmy-Jin (Jinhee Joung)? She's so rude to Beca, giving her the cold shoulder for no reason at all, and only seems friendly with other Korean students. What, is that supposed to imply that all Koreans are only friends with each other and want nothing to do with white people? Whatever it is, it's RACIST. Also, this was 2012.And lastly, we've got the easy highlight: the music. The movie is filled to the brim with so many terrific, catchy musical numbers that the Bellas and other groups (including the real-life University of Virginia Hullabahoos, who make a cameo appearance as themselves!) sing, from songs by Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Pitbull and La Roux, to songs by Europe, Vicki Sue Robinson, The Bangles and Ace of Base. Special mention goes to Beca incorporating ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"" by Simple Minds from The Breakfast Club (a hilarious movie) into the Bellas' final set just for Jesse.Everything considered, Pitch Perfect is a really fun movie that hits a lot of high notes, with its excellent performances and catchy musical numbers. But at the same time, it also hits a few low notes with its rather flawed script and sometimes questionable humor. All the same, it's a really enjoyable movie that any music lover is bound to like.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Amazing music... amazing movie? Not so much,"Acapella performances always amaze me. The fact that this film was based on acapella singing, choreography and musical arrangement makes it fantastic in that sense. If you're really into musicals, this one is a unique and original twist in that genre.But besides that, everything else was meh. Plot line was predictable. Angsty, ""different"" freshman joins a preppy, all-girls acapella group (The Bellas) in dire need of a makeover in preparation for competition season against their *gasp* All-male rivals, the Treblemakers! In fact, their rivalry is so intense that romantic affairs are forbidden between the two groups *shocker*So what happens next? It's pretty obvious.Characters themselves are also pretty flat, one dimensional and sometimes a bit confusing. They stick to their stereotype and don't deviate much from it. This makes their personalities and plot choices in the movie also easily predictable.So, in conclusion: watch for the music. It's definitely a different approach to the typical ""high school musical"" genre. But in terms of everything else - don't expect anything too groundbreaking.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A really fun and enjoyable musical,"Well i am a little late to this party, well actually really late but with the sequel right around the corner i thought why not see why there is a sequel in the first place. And i can just say that i have no idea why or how i managed to miss this movie over the last three years. In terms of modern musicals it is definitely one of the biggest ones out there. This movie utilises great musical pieces and manages to incorporate an interesting plot and quite a bit of pretty good comedy that connects with the personalities of each of the characters. I will start with saying that i thought the characters were very well written, there may be some stereotypical hints in the way they act but overall you have a group of women who are all very different and recognisable for different reasons. This diversity really helps to keep interest in the film have certain jokes last for the entire duration. In terms of the performances they were all very good, especially Anna Kendrick and Rebel Wilson who just steal the show in mostly every scene. Rebel Wilson's comedy was one of the highlights, always lightening the mood every now and then.The only issue i had with the film was it being just a tad inconsistent for the first two thirds mainly. I constantly found myself gradually enjoying the film and then not as much and then really enjoying it before kinda wanting it to move on again. It felt like a bit of a roller-coaster ride in terms of interesting and not so interesting parts, a more balanced film work have worked a lot more. So in the end, apart from that i really found myself enjoying this film, there was a good plot, likable characters, plenty of comedy and some great songs that really get you singing along. - 7.7",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Campus Cliché,"Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a supposedly edgy girl who is forced to attend college by her professor father. He's as cool as a film aimed at teens will allow him to be (see Harry Dean Stanton in ""Pretty in Pink""). More than anything, I think ""Pitch Perfect"" wants to be a John Hughes film, but there are numerous similarities to other films (like the cheer films). Beca wants to be a producer of music, but she find herself a member of the Bellas, an all girl a cappella singing group dedicated to conservative dress and tame renditions. Beca plays the adventurous girl cliché we have seen in many other films. She is the welder who bring flashdance to the ballet world. She is the white girl who brings hip hop to the ballet world. She is Baby, bringing dirty dancing to the stodgy world of the middle-upper class vacation resort. What revelation does Beca bring to the glee world? The layering of songs. Earth-shaking.Beca has a rather uninspired romance with a guy who sings for another a cappella group, The Treblemakers. He, unlike her, is a movie fan and he recommends she watch ""The Breakfast Club"" (by John Hughes). After finally watching the film, she suggests that the Bellas reveal secrets about themselves, but nothing is really revealed.There also is the clichéd fat girl, named Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), who is sexually aggressive and loud--surprise!""Pitch Perfect"" is a Glee-ful tribute whose best attributes are the music and the voices that sing the music. They make the film worth listening to.Also worth watching are Adam Devine as Bumper (""Modern Family) and Brittany Snow as Chloe. Too bad the script was not strong enough to support the other talented actors in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
More entertaining than anticipated,"More entertaining than anticipated.I enjoyed myself watching 'Pitch Perfect', simply put. That's largely thanks to pleasant music choices and a fun cast. The plot isn't anything crazy good but the aforementioned things are done nicely.Anna Kendrick (Beca) is enjoyable as the lead, she is supported by Skylar Astin (Jesse) who I did find a little bit hit-and-miss to be honest. Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) and Brittany Snow (Chloe) are the only ones of the rest that stood out to me, though all of the The Barden Bellas are solid in actual fact. Elsewhere, Adam DeVine (Bumper) is amusing.Don't get me wrong there a few moments that are cringe and some jokes do not land, but for the vast majority it's a fun watch - in my opinion, anyway. Onto the sequels!",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A surprisingly good take on old and overused plots,"Surprisingly enough Pitch Perfect is based on a book, shocking I know, and a non-fiction at that - WTF? - I can't imagine reading a book about collegiate a Cappella groups much less watching a movie about it.The Pitch Perfect plot has every single textbook cliché to make the film a lot worse than what it is but they were smart enough to use them well. Although, there's a boy who meets a girl it's not all about the romance, there's a group who is clearly the underdog but it's not a pity party, and there's a type of good guys against bad guys situation but it's downplayed to the point that they are hardly any bad guys in the film. So what's left? The music, the competition, the camaraderie, and slightly stereotypical but strong women characters. Add in a dash of over the top comedy and it kinda works.Pitch Perfect does not take itself too seriously, it's entertaining with good one-liners and some bad ones. It's weird to say but the movie has personality, those quirky characters are easy to like and even if you know where it is heading - because it's that predictable - it is still an enjoyable movie. @wornoutspines",6.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Overrated and gross,"How this got rated higher than Mean Girls is beyond me. At least Mean Girls managed to be raw without losing its class. Pitch Perfect was so desperate for cheap laughs its cringe worthy. I actually watched it with a group of friends, one actually fell asleep and the others weren't laughin, or at least not at the movie. First of all, (if i remember correctly) a bunch of misfits join a choir to go against a rival group. Okay, where did they even come up with this idea? A UNIVERSITY choir so desperate for members they pick ALL weird girls. But I digress, thats not the worst. Just the immaturity of the plot all throughout. Rivalries like that don't exist, normally people move on and don't dwell on the fact they were teased. Who are they to them anyway? Its just a bunch of pranks and childish competition from adults. And if Anna Kendricks character was supposed to be an average boring girl then they did a perfect job with her. The humor was just gross, the girl throwing up and then having the whistle land in there ughh I almost puked. And the Asian girl saying ""I ate my twin in the womb"" thats not funny! Or relatable. This is what I mean by ""desperate"". Then the scene with the puppets singing ""F. U. F U very much"" OH HO HO is funny becas she said eff you OH! I cannot quote anything except for fat amy talking about her nickname, whereas i can quote almost every scene in mean girls ""you go Glen Coco!"". There's not that many funny girls' movies out there so there's not much to compare it to. But this movie further emphasizes why there's not that many funny girls' movies out there...The only reason this got a one is because of the effort in the music and choreography.

"Like camp rock, but college","This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen I've never written a review on here before but looking at that score I just kind of felt like I had to. First off it's almost impossible to stand Anna Kendrick's character, she's always complaining about something, which I could get behind if she wasn't complaining about things that us normal people can only dream about, such as free college, the most perfect guy ever likes her (seriously no guy on earth is that perfect), a big group of people want to be her friends. I know it's awful right? The reason she complains about the free college is because her dad is making her go (he's a professor, that's why it's free) but she's an adult, if she doesn't want to go she doesn't have to, but if she didn't go there wouldn't be a plot. Anyway, I didn't think it was that funny either, Rebel Wilson was the only one that made me laugh, and even then I didn't laugh that often. Maybe I just don't get singing humor. Even then they keep using the same gags over and over ""aca-awesome"" and the one girl that's really quiet and the lesbian, it gets old, it wasn't even that funny the first time. Anyway, the plot is boring anyway, self-absorbed brat joins a club she didn't want to join and finds out she likes it and makes new friends. How original! By the way, Becca mentioned her ""stepmonster"" one time and she was never brought up again, was she really a monster? Because she tends to exaggerate I mean she made free college sound like prison.Sorry that my review is a train wreck, but it doesn't make the movie any less of one.

Pitch Perfect Perfection,"I just saw this movie in an advanced screening through my university and I have to say, I was blown away. I usually like these types of movies so I was gearing myself up for satisfaction (I mean if you saw the trailer how couldn't you?) and boy, did they deliver! It was hilarious, fresh and just plain awesome. Yes, some of the vocals were a little auto tuned or weak compared to real acapella groups and the actors are all pretty much over the age of 25 but I still think they did a good job. Rebel Wilson was hilarious as Fat Amy. If you thought her jokes in the trailer are pretty funny, there is even more where that came from! Skylar Astin is thoroughly adorable as love interest Jesse (and his AMAZING VOCALS brings me back to his days as Georg in the original production of Spring Awakening with Lea Michele and Jonathan Groff) and he makes me fall in love with him from the very first scene. Anna Kendrick is believable as a college freshmen, although the fact that she is actually 27 (along with Brittany Snow who is also 27, Anna Camp who is 30 and Rebel Wilson who is 27) kind of puts a damper on that.

I immediately felt the need to speak up and say that this movie is not even in the same category as Mean Girls. Mean Girls is meant to be ironic and satiric. Pitch Perfect was meant to be a plain ol' comedy, but whatever, that's beside the point.The Music: Cliché, stupid, lame - they tried to put some throwbacks in there, but apparently no one knows about music that existed before the 80s. The movie tries to make the ""mash-up"" a hip new thing. It's not. People have been making mash-ups since music began. What do you think a medley is? Calm down. The lip- syncing was SO obvious and I could hear the audio engineer pitch correcting every singer.The Acting: It wasn't bad. But my next point is...The Writing: The plot was old and overused. The characters were exaggerated to the point where I wasn't sure if they were part of the joke or if I was supposed to take them seriously. The jokes sucked and were sort of racist. Rebel Wilson's lines weren't even that good, but her presence was sort of nice.I get it. A writer tried to cash in on a profitable idea, and it worked. What I don't understand is all the rave reviews this crap got. Was it because a bunch of older men wrote reviews about hot young actresses? That's my best guess. (See Lena Dunham's girls.) I'll never know. What I do know is that I could not watch the whole thing and I had to turn it off.",3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Perfectly Hilarious,"I have to say, I was very hesitant to see this movie. After all the hype and build up (of what has seemed like an eternity) in commercials and previews I was worried this would be a repeat of the let down and disappointment I had when I saw Couples Retreat. THIS MOVIE WAS FANTASTIC! I don't think I have laughed that hard in a long time, and I wish I could have stayed and watched it again, because I am pretty sure I missed so much because I was laughing so hard. Rebel Wilson absolutely stole the show, and she is amazing!!! Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow & Skylar Austin delivered! Go see the movie, it is worth EVERY penny!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
An absolute blast!,"If you read a synopsis of Pitch Perfect, it just sounds like your typical rom-com, coming-of-age, singing movie; but I swear to you it's not. After being forced to see it by my stepbrother and his girlfriend, I was very, very pleasantly surprised. Pitch Perfect is probably one of my favorite movies ever now. As soon as the credits started rolling I knew I was in love and I needed to see it again. So I did, a week later. The music was aca-mazing! The soundtrack is absolutely off the charts! I am obsessed! My favorite song from it is the Bellas finals. The plot was a bit cliché, but good. The acting wasn't fantastic, but the goal here clearly wasn't to try and get nominated for an Oscar. They just wanted us to like the movie, and I more than liked it, so they succeeded.Anna Kendrick played Beca, an amateur DJ who wants nothing more than to leave college and move to Los Angeles, causing her to be miserable all the time and shutting out everyone who cares about her. Her main love interest Jesse, played by Skylar Astin (Ugh, I just melted when I said his name), is everything a charming college boy should be. Plus, he can sing. He tries to bond with Beca and sweep her off her feet, but she just shuts him out. This causes Jesse's heart to break and every girl in America to get tears in their eyes. Needless to say, I fell in love with him. Brittany Snow and Anna Camp were hilarious as the Bella's head voices; and Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins were scene-stealers playing the commentators for the competitions. But, no one (not even Skylar) stole the show like Rebel Wilson did as Fat Amy. I won't say anything else. Go see Pitch Perfect!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Lesbi-honest....,"I truly thought this would be a new favorite movie for me. However even half-way through I just knew I would never want to see it again. I am stunned that so many people think it's fantastic. Honestly a lot of the people I know who adore this movie are really immature. But I guess that's beside the point. Pitch Perfect reminded me of that movie that you think is awesome when you're thirteen, and when you watch it again in your early twenties you can't believe you ever liked it. The characters are unlikable (besides Fat Amy because she's the only one who says anything slightly funny), and it's a really predictable story that is WAY too cliché. Granted, there are some okay movies that are predictable that you still enjoy watching (The Proposal for instance), but this is not one of them. Bottom line; this is a movie that was extremely overrated and made out to be some fantastic, enjoyable favorite, when in reality it was boring, dumb, and on the verge of annoying. I am truly shocked at the high reviews people gave it because I think it is one of the worst movies I've seen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Great Family Film for Summer Vacation,"For those of you who are on the fence about musicals, this self aware, comedic film will make you fall in love with the genre. It makes fun of the potential ""nerdiness"" factor that is often bestowed upon Acapella groups, while thoroughly convincing you the singing thespians truly are the coolest in the crowd.Though sexually explicit at times, it does not exploit young women, in fact, it does just the opposite. It promotes young women finding their own road to happiness and being successful at it by working as a team. There are not many ""buddy movies"" out there starring women. The actresses in the ""Pitch Perfect"" are given original personalities that differ from the usual stereotypes we see on the screen. Kudos to the producers Elizabeth Banks, Max Handelman and Paul Brooks for starring strong, complicated women in a very entertaining film.Be warned, you will get hooked and watch ""Pitch Perfect"" a few times. There is so much going on that some of the jokes get lost the first time you see it -- so you have to watch it again, and again. This is a good thing, because now you've got a great film with which to look forward.The first time you accidentally call something ""acca-awesome"" and the person next to you recognizes the meme, you know that you have met another convert as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Not just a Chick-Flick,"Let's face it; the New Year hasn't been great for films-excluding The Hobbit. I wasn't heading into the film with high expectations; Relatively unknown cast, touted by some as a Glee movie and lot's of teen-girl hype.First Half: Forgettable with a fair amount of humour and wit but nothing really gut busting in ways that Ted and 21 Jump Street proved to be. Too many musical numbers and not enough comedy, perhaps restricted by the 12a/PG13 rating? The film could have pushed the boundaries a bit more, it could have been raunchier, touchier and had more sexual humour.Second Half: Perhaps the funniest 50 minutes of any Teen-Comedy I've ever seen, that's comparing it to films like American Pie. The jokes came thick and fast and the musical numbers were a lot better and jokes were tied into them. Rebel Wilson is simply hilariously brilliant. Her character ""Fat Amy"" is one that should go down in film history as one of the funniest of all time. The film is more than a chick flick and deserves some high praise. It's only let down by the first half.Could have been funnier if it had dared to push the boundaries. But overall a good solid comedy; 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A fantastic film for a capella fans!,"This was a movie i had very low expectations and boy i was so wrong. I thought this was pretty darn funny. You could see that the acting was spot on and i loved Anna Kendrick, i really hope to see some more of her in the near future. And she actually can sing. She stars even on Broadway on some occasions. Off course i was surprised about Brittany Snow, i had no idea she could actually sing like this, so this was a double surprise for me!Music was spot on and i really liked the male and female voices so much harmony, even thinking of buying the soundtrack.

A perfect bubblegum film.,"I was kind of forced to go to this, it would never have been a film I would have chose to see. When the movie opened I first thought it was an Australian film with that unique humour on the ""strictly ballroom"" vein, so things were looking up. When I start to recognize the mainly American cast I was already into the film.Its one of those basic story lines where a group of no hopers overcome their little problems with the usual love interest as a side plot and then it all comes good in the end. It's perfect bubblegum, I smiled and laughed all the way through and the next day I found myself re-watching some of the songs on youtube.The cast are great and IMO Rebel Wilson as Fatamy steals it. The music is great and its a perfect date movie and I thoroughly enjoyed this film. But LOL don't tell my mates.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Really good!,"The storyline was a bit transparent, not necessarily bad. The performances were super fun and the songs were quite current (older viewers might not adore that, but they still should watch it!). This comedy is kind of daring, but that's what makes it even funnier! The main character, played by the sweet Anna Kendrick might be a bit too Kristen Stewart, too straight-faced for your taste at times, but that did not bother me at all. Everybody loved the inspiring Rebel Wilson in this movie, she is funny and adorable! The beautiful Brittany Snow played Chloe, one of the girls who mostly helped Beca fit in, but she didn't really have a background story, which I think she deserved. You are going to love all of the girls in the Barden Bellas, especially the uptight Aubrey or the weird Lilly. Their opponent The Treblemakers is also composed by hotties like Jesse, Beca's. You should definitely check it out, I think it's one of the best musical comedies out there!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Amazing movie!,"""Pitch Perfect"" was an outstanding movie! The acting was incomparable for a first. Furthermore, the performances filmed were very interesting to watch and had a perfect sound. The movie also had a comedy feel to it also. I would recommend this movie to nearly everyone I know.Moreover, the acting played a contributor to excellence of the movie. Some of my favorite characters included Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, and Rebel Wilson. Anna Kendrick plays Beca, the main character. Beca is rebellious and has the dream of making music. Kendrick really seems to pull of the look and act of her character with her very chill personality. Conversely, Brittany Snow plays a very different character. Chloe is another member of the Bella's, yet she is very perky and always goes along with the group. Strangely Beca and Chloe seem to get along with each other very well. Ultimately, there is one of the rebels. This would be Skylar Astin, who plays Jesse, one of Beca's only friends. He also loves to create music but for something different. For movies. Finally comes Fat Amy. This character is played by Rebel Wilson, who is hilarious. Fat Amy seems to be most of the comedy in this movie. I consider her to be the cherry on top.Additionally, the musical performances were beyond excellence. Evan note was hit perfectly and the combinations of artists were very interesting. These women seemed to mix the most unlikely artists together. Some of the events in the movie involve lots of singing, some of it serious, such as competition, and others just for amusement. And what really seemed to catch me is that they don't sing about their emotions, they just sing because they love doing it.On the contrary, many people would expect the movie to be another version of High School Musical. I have heard many people say that this movie will be all about singing out randomly just to express themselves and their feelings, yet it really was not. They all came out saying that it was amazingly funny and would totally watch it again.In addition, the movie seemed to be a true comedy. One of my favorite parts was when Jesse exclaimed ""Organized nerd singing? This is great!"" The characters really seem to express their minds, and when they do, it just makes them seem all the more funny. I believe that the director, Jason Moore, made an admirable choice by making a funny script because the media on this movie shows mostly good reviews. I think that this movie will leave you laughing for days after seeing it.If you ever have time to go and see a movie, I would completely recommend going to see this one. Do you like comedies? Are you one of those people that loves to laugh at your movies? I really hope that you enjoy ""Pitch Perfect.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
c r a p o l a,"My wife told me to come over and sit on the couch with her and watch this funny/cute movie. She had caramel corn so I figured, what the hell, at least I get a snack.From the opening I had a sneaking suspicion this was going to be a movie version of Glee. I asked and she said, ""Not really, but there's some singing..."" I immediately began to shovel as much caramel corn as I could get, paying close attention to globules of sweet goodness until the bowl was empty, whereupon I got up and went back to work. My sometimes tedious job of localization engineering held far more appeal than a group of angsty college kids slogging their way through a contrived script, towards a plot that Helen Keller could have seen from halfway around the globe.There are no surprises here other than barf. That's right, BARF. The only redeeming moment of this wet turd was the projectile vomiting. Had she vomited on the made-by-kids-forced-into-slave-labor MAC, I would have given this movie another star.The whole, ""oh dad just leave me alone to be me"" thing has been absolutely beaten to death year after year by Hollywood to the point where I didn't think anyone in their right mind could possibly consider funding this garbage. I guess when you are going to piggy back off the success of a (only the gods know why) hit TV series, anything goes.I honestly don't see the appeal in ripping off everyone's music to make yet another version with lame electronic beats being thrown about.Dear wannabe DJ rejects,Owning a MAC doesn't make you a DJ, sorry. Anyone can own a iPod, MAC and or better notebook/laptop/tablet and download MP3s and then play them at a party.Owning a giant pair of headphones with a lot of bass doesn't make you a DJ either. Anyone, literally ANYONE on this freaking planet can buy headphones.Ruining original music by slapping whatever garbage beats you think are fresh/phat/sick/dope doesn't make you more innovative or interesting at all. Could you be more unoriginal? A one year old crapping himself while giggling can come up with this stuff. Just put the MAC in front of him and let him start slapping away at the keys and before you know it, a rave/party/whatever will break out.It takes 0 talent to cut and paste some MP3s together, layer your own BS you've ripped off of someone else, then start altering the pitch while holding one earphone up to your head and gyrating like a complete idiot.

"Perfectly Cast, Spanks the Formula","The diversity of the crowd drawn to Pitch Perfect was quite surprising. It was as if everyone had favorites in the cast (mine is Rebel Wilson). There is just enough raunch, predictability and formula-dedication in the film to relax the audience. Individual characters really bring the picture alive. A big surprise is Ben Platt who plays Benji: from his IMDb profile, it looks like this is his first role and he nails it. Despite a bad haircut, he can't hide being smokin' hot.Another favorite is Adam DeVine, he has just the right amount of annoying cockiness to carry off his music nerd persona. The quiet Asian girl who speaks in whispers (played by Hana Mae Lee) steals every scene she's in and she utters -- or, more accurately, mutters some of the best lines EVER! Some of the predictable moments are such utter giveaways, it's actually funny. And as I had hoped, Rebel Wilson is an awesome, funny, unexpected powerhouse.How does Anna Kendrick do? She's beautiful and has an awesome voice. Skylar Astin -- despite his porn star name -- is wonderful, until the writers turn his character into a jilted mess. He has a knockout voice and it's certain he's adorable in the shower. PITCH PERFECT is everything GLEE wants to be when it grows up.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Outstanding movie,"I couldn't wait for this movie to be released. I am not a singer, not a dancer and not typically into musicals. Anna Kendricks has become a favorite of mine over the past few years and i was curious how she would do in a more central role. She impressed me yet again.I absolutely loved this movie!

Having seen her in several movies I was shocked at just how amazing her voice was.The movie has just the right balance of humor, romance and gritty-girl-claws-out digs.I saw the movie with a friend (couldn't get my significant other to go).

'Pitch Perfect' Is a Perfect Blend of Comedy and Music,"Laughs is what sets this ""misfit saves the day"" singing movie apart from other teen and/or singing movies. Laughs and a satiric wit ably presented by an engaging cast. KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Victoria Burns, age 14, calls it ""surprisingly really funny"" and says she intends to watch it over again – which is also surprising as she shares that this type of movie is not usually one that's for her.Pitch Perfect Reviewed by Victoria Burns Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yL3LAga_WzQI went to see Pitch Perfect and it is surprisingly really funny. I do not usually like musical types of movies, but this one was one of the best.At first I thought that this movie would be one of the ones with random outbreaks of song, but this movie has a nice storyline and it is funny. The singing is amazing. Plus, since the move is about an a capella group, it is interesting and kind of impressive to see the actors make the track to the music with their voices.This movie is about Beca (Anna Kendrick), a girl who wants more than anything to be a music producer but her dad makes her go to college first. Finally, her dad says that if she goes to college for a year, joins a club and really tries her best, he will let her drop out and go to California. This gives her some incentive to do well in school and join the Barden Bellas, the school's all-girl a capella group.The Bellas' arch rival is the all-boys group, the Trebles. Beca starts to fall for a member of the Trebles, Jesse (Skylar Astin), which is forbidden by the Bellas' uptight leader, Aubrey (played by Anna Camp). The Bellas are old-fashioned and Beca is tired of it so she quits, then she rejoins and makes the Bellas better than ever, new, and ready to win. Whether they win against the Trebles is a mystery that you'll have to watch to find out.I love this movie, and the characters are very eclectic to say the least. My favorite character is Fat Amy because she's hilarious and says whatever is on her mind, and it shows because she calls herself ""Fat"" Amy. I absolutely love this movie and will definitely be watching it repeatedly.I give it five out of five stars because I like that the actors can sing well, and the way that they make the music track with their voices is amazing. I recommend this movie for anyone who likes music and comedy, because together it is a great combination. I like that the movie is not just about the singing and that it has a good storyline as well. I recommend this movie for ages mature 12 and up because the movie has some foul language but overall is a good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Romance to cheer for, low-grade comedy, but musical numbers both predictable and perfect","""Pitch Perfect"" is kind of like taking ""Glee"" and putting it into a college environment, but is more like mixing the popularity of ""Bridesmaids""-styled humour and the popularity of a cappella singing. The Barden Bellas are a struggling all-girl singing group trying to succeed with female pop songs from yester-year and showing off their bikini bodies, but after an on-stage meltdown, the team is left with two high-strung seniors and is forced to rebuild.Beca (Anna Kendrick) is an aspiring DJ with no interest in campus life, but after a deal made with her father (a small but good role by John Benjamin Hickey), Beca considers joining the Bellas. Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), who calls herself Fat Amy so twig bitches like the Bella leaders don't call her that behind her back, is not what Aubrey (Anna Camp) and Chloe (Brittany Snow) have in mind to rebuild the group, but she can match pitch perfectly.What makes ""Pitch Perfect"" a good movie is the supporting characters. Fat Amy is a fully-realized character where everything she does and everything she says matches what we have come to know about her. Stacie (Alexis Knapp) and Cynthia Rose (Ester Dean) have even less screen time, but are almost just as complete of characters. Amy, in particular, is hilarious and provides all of the humour in the movie.The lead characters aren't nearly as well thought-out. Aubrey is a screeching, high-maintenance control freak, one-dimensionally so, and her few moments of humour are very low quality and very poorly realized (her aforementioned on-stage meltdown is almost laughably bad it's so poorly edited). Chloe, unfortunately, has a very simplistic role as Aubrey's only sidekick who also shares Beca's vision. Snow is a better actress than that.As the Bellas are trying to find their groove as the competition regionals and finals approach, Beca has met a boy who belongs to their all-male rivals. Jesse (Skylar Astin) is cute and extremely likable (an actually very impressive feat considering he got in over his quirky but cute roommate). Jesse aspires to create movie scores (yet another excellent character trait), and through his friendship with Beca, hopes to introduce her to some of the classics. All movies, as Beca complains, are predictable. You know that the boy is going to get the girl and you know what is going to happen before it happens. Jesse says that doesn't matter because the perfect music can still move you to tears. His prime example is ""The Breakfast Club"".Of course ""Pitch Perfect"" was predictable, and while that might drag during some of their early competition performances, the predictability works for the type of movie it is. Sometimes the comedic dialogue went too far for a joke, other times the humour was just a cheap gag, but overall it was still funny. With better, more original comedy it could have been a very good movie. Beca and Jesse made a great on-screen couple and had the audience cheering them on. In fact, ""Pitch Perfect"" works very well as a romantic comedy with a non-romantic primary storyline.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I thought it looked like a spoof of some sort with actual singing. It exceeded my expectations. I found myself laughing out loud during many scenes and the singing was absolutely sublime. The casting on this movie was dead on. Anna Kendrick was great in the lead role, opposite Skylar Astin. Anna Camp turned in such a superlative performance that I wanted to throttle her beautiful neck 30 minutes in because of her stubbornness. I have to say that Rebel Wilson absolutely stole the best laughs, though! That girl IS talented. I can't wait to see her next role.

OMMovieReviews,"Dry, witty, sarcastic, and a bit corny. ""Pitch Perfect"" is a solid movie that seems to come off the success of TV's ""Glee,"" which has spurned a number of quirky, A-Capella related shows and movies. But this is not ""Glee."" There is drama and comedy, but at the end of the movie you have a smile on your face, you don't feel like your life has been wasted away.""Pitch Perfect"" follows Beca, played by Anna Kendrick, a freshman in college, who isn't really looking to find her way. She loves music, in fact she composes DJ mixes of different songs in hopes of working in Los Angeles one day. While walking through the quad, Beca comes across an activity booth for a college all-female singing group, the Barden Bellas, where she meets Chloe, played by Brittany Snow, and Aubrey, played by Anna Camp. Chloe and Aubrey try to entice Beca to join the Bellas, but Beca decides that she is above all that and moves on. Later, while singing in the shower, Chloe hears Beca's voice and convinces her to come try out for the Bellas, which Beca does. Beca also meets Jesse, played by Skylar Astin, another freshman who tries out for, and joins, the Treble-makers, the all-male A-Capella singing group on campus. They have a rocky relationship throughout the majority of the movie, as Beca has a hard time letting people into her life. Fat Amy, portrayed wonderfully by Rebel Wilson, also becomes a part of the Bellas, where she becomes good friends with Beca, Chloe, and the rest of the Bellas.""Pitch Perfect"" is solid movie, that makes you laugh, wince, and, well maybe not cry, but feel some kind of sad emotion. Rebel Wilson is that actress that really steals the movie with her one-liners and just shear humorous presence. The music they sing throughout the movie is good, and the whole idea of the collegiate A-Capella groups really does work in this movie. It's nice to see that this dry and sarcastic type of humor that was really made famous by ""Monty Python"" is coming back, and audiences are loving it.

Rebel Wilson plays probably everyone's favorite character ""Fat Amy"" a girl who does not care but will live life to the fullest in her own funny ways with her amazing vocal skills. The list for this cast is incredible and you should see the movie to truly appreciate all of the work into making this movie.Laughs are at every corner of the film. As the Bella's and Trebles try to defeat each other in the ""Riff Off"" and the signing round to the finials. Also not to be confused with this movie being a musical; there isn't any random singing and dance number. Some of the songs may relate to an emotion stirring around with the characters involving Beca and Jesse. Due to the humiliation that the Bella's had gotten the year previous, only made the burning fire of hatred to the Trebles worse. In addition, to the confused feeling that Beca and Jesse have, Beca has a difficult time to let him in when he is trying his best to just be there for her when things go a little bit hay wired.Even though this movie is was rated PG-13 it is definitely on the brink of being rated R. With some of the characters attitudes and actions. Moreover, with the inappropriate scenes such as how Beca was asked, forced to audition.In every other scene to retaliate to Anna Camp's character Aubrey a bossy, controlling, cyclic person, Beca or Fat Amy has something. However most comeback are sent to the Trebles' leader Bumper. The director Jason Moore and producers Paul Brooks, Max Handelman, and Elizabeth Banks are brilliant people who help make the best Friday night movie of the year.To conclude why Pitch Perfect is a knock-out movie and why you should see this movie is because it is better than Glee and Bring it combined. Due to the fact that it has all the good parts, without the cheesy factors that the general public wish they would leave out.

Predictability personified,"I simply love acapella music, I might be actually interested in a soundtrack if the songs sampled are actually full-length.BUT - the predictability of this movie is simply unbelievable at all levels: the plot, the ethnicity and sexual choice of 'misfits', the 'romance', the twist, the ending. You name it you have it and more. The characters are cartoons of the flat B&W sketched type. I am not a big fan of political correctness but the jokes when not 'punny' where quite offensive to many people. I'm beginning to suspect that it may have been generated by a free smart phone app. This best-before 80's formula self-describes when one girl enjoys wallowing in another's vomit.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The perfect box set,"If you liked ""Mean Girls,"" ""Easy A"" and especially ""Bring It On,"" here is the perfect final movie for that box set you've been building of smart, very well-written, insightful young adult films. Possibly - barely - just a step below the rest in quality because each one had already set the bar so high, but very equal to their attempts to make intelligent comedies in a day when dumb, tone-deaf, and formulaic all rule at the box office.

Anna Kendrick,"Pitch Perfect is a surprisingly fun film that goes about as emotionally deep as it needs to without getting overly mushy. The storyline is of a reluctant college student (Anna Kendrick) who learns to open herself up more to people and possibilities through joining an a capella group. Anna Kendrick, who's been nominated for an Academy Award, is probably too good for a film like this, but thank God the producers were able to get her because she gives her all and elevates the film significantly.The film, adapted from a book wherein the author spent significant amount of time with 3 college a capella groups, delves deep into the a capella world and it's clear that the filmmakers have done their research and this sets this film apart from the typical coming-of-age college film as we're taken deep into the world of this subculture. The music itself is also very entertaining..Although there's a sort of love-hate romance (wherein the boy's primary method of winning over the girl is annoying her to death), the film is all about girl power and how this loner learns to bond with other females for the first time and (excuse the pun) make beautiful music.With Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Adam Driver, Anna Camp, and Rebel Wilson, the supporting cast has a great chemistry despite the fact that it's difficult to believe some of these people are 18-22 years old (Anna Camp and Rebel Wilson in particular)The film's screenplay is by Kay Canon (who has written for 30 Rock and is well-known in comedy circles) and while there are some laughs, it's not primarily a comedy. It IS a fun film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

At first, when I saw this film advertised, I thought it would be cheesy but as soon as the first five minutes were over I was intrigued to find out more!!!! Anna Kendrick was fabulous in this film as was the other characters, especially Rebel Wilson who, whenever she is on the screen, made everyone laugh and still makes me laugh every time I watch it. Also Ben Platt, well what can I say, this is his first ever film and he blew me away! He was amazing in this film and made all other competition forgotten in one of the last scenes of the film.I highly recommend this film to anybody who likes to laugh...a lot!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
This film is brilliant!,"I thought the film was excellent with a great cast. I particularly enjoyed the performances of Anna Camp, Brittany Snow and Rebel Wilson. Beca and Chloe's rendition of 'Titanium' in the shower, the Nodes, the confessions and the Barden Bellas never being able to work out when to take their hands out of the 'hands in' (""on three, or after three?"") were my favourite scenes and moments. ""I think we all know where this is going - lesbi-honest"".The best characters:AUBREY: Even though she went about the place as if she had a pole stuck up her arse, she was still likable (and I suppose the fact that Anna Camp is rather fit helps as well).CHLOE: I love her.

"What Glee would be, (if it sucked)","Well it's official this is BY FAR the WORST movie I have ever set through in it's entirety. I kept making little excuses to myself, maybe the plot will reveal itself. I gave this movie a 2, and the only reason I gave it that is I have to save 1 star for a movie that is worse than this one. Just to let you know, the acting was horrible, the plot was not in evidence anywhere in the film. At least they were consistent the writing was just as bad as the acting, and let's not forget the brains behind this whole pathetic movie the director, he was just as inept as everyone else.The story is somewhat of a ""Bring It On"" melded with ""Glee"", and a little ""Full Metal Jacket"" not that anything in the movie reminded me of Full Metal Jacket"", but it did make want to eat my gun, just like Private Pyle.Oh and while I am on the topic the little lie I told myself was that at least once they got to the competition at least these kids would be able to sing, wrong again, the music is not even any good. I suppose when you bring a lot of no name actors/actresses into a movie that was poorly written, poorly directed, poorly acted then you probably shouldn't expect much from it, hence the generous 2.Do yourself a favor, don't waste 2 hours of your life watching this, I would rather watch Curling Finals from Quebec, at least it's funny.",2.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"""Pitch Perfect"", a Must See!","Pitch Perfect was an amazing, musical comedy anyone could enjoy. This film has a fantastic touch of humor, great mix of music, and a dash of competition that keeps everyone's attention on the screen. I love this movie, and I'm positive everyone else who has watched it would agree.Obviously, no one can say no to a comical film, like Pitch Perfect. Jason Moore, the director, does a fabulous job finding the strengths of his cast and displaying it in this movie. Rebel Wilson, who plays the wonderful Fat Amy, is the most hilarious character in Pitch Perfect. With her overflowing confidence, witty lines, and her marvelous spunk, Fat Amy is one of the most memorable characters of 2012. Jason couldn't have found a better comedian and lines to make this cinema more hilarious than it is. The humor gets better when a controlling singer, a freshman with an attitude, and a whole group of unlikely girls get together to form an a cappella group, the Barden Bella's.Additionally, the movie has a mix of music that blew me away. Music performances involved in this film are not the cheesy glee kind or the Broadway numbers; the numbers performed are a clever mixture of modern music and old favorites that have everyone's feet tapping, for example, when the Barden Bella's sing a clever mash-up of ""Just the Way You are"" by Bruno Mars and ""Just a Dream"" by Nelly. My favorite part of the movie was the riff-off, a competition between a cappella groups where they have to make up performances based off a random genre selection. One of the category options in the riff- off was actually songs ruined by Glee.After the movie, I even bought some songs from the movie off of iTunes. Pitch Perfect inspires to start singing, along with the friends I saw the movie with.However, no movie can be perfect. Along with the movies wit and humor, comes some judgment. I wouldn't recommend this movie for younger audiences; Pitch Perfect has some comedy meant for older ages. With that said, great lessons are learned in this movie like when Fat Amy said, ""Even though some of you are pretty thin, you all have fat hearts, and that's what counts."" There is one part that sickens some, like when the performers vomit, but the rest of the movie is worth the ten seconds of disgust.Furthermore, competition makes any audience glued to the screen. With the constant tension between groups, the pressure of winning, and reputation on the line, the cinema catches the audiences attention. Along with the competition, members of each group battle friendship, romances, and college on their journeys, which really showed me how relatable the movie actually is. Jason does a fantastic job creating this movie, and I wouldn't change anything about it.Ultimately, Pitch Perfect was a pleasant surprise as soon as I walked in the theater. My goal is to have people enjoy this movie as much as I did. This film is a comical musical that I will never forget. See Pitch Perfect, you won't regret it. This combination of comedy, music, and competition is a great way to enjoy your day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Big musical fun!,"After seeing a lot of good comments about this movie throughout the Internet, I decided to give it a shot. Big surprise, I was very impressed! This is a good movie that balances character development with jokes and songs. It takes a lot of jabs at Glee, all in good fun of course. Honestly, I didn't have a lot of hope for this movie, but now, I'm glad to see that I was wrong.Pitch Perfect tells the story of Beca (Anna Kendrick), a girl who just enters college as a way to achieve her dream of becoming a DJ. Aubrey (Anna Camp) and Chloe (Brittany Snow) are members of the Bellas, an all-female a cappella group who seeks members to enter a national competition. Upon seeing Beca sing, the Bellas see Beca as the key to victory. Beca is not interested, but her father convinces her to give the group a chance. During her time of the group, Beca begins to learn the value of friendship. She also begins to fall in love with Jesse (Skylar Austin), a member of a rival group. Needless to say, hilarity ensues.In this movie you fall in love with all the characters, from the quirky and irresponsible Fat Amy to the incredibly nice Chloe. At first, i thought that musicals were only to have fun and nothing else, but this movie proved me that even in musicals, you can be emotionally invested in the characters. You can sympathize with their struggles, you get to know their hopes and dreams.I hope this review can convince you of watching this great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Filled with good and likable performances highlighted by Kendrick's soulful lead.,"'PITCH PERFECT': Four Stars (Out of Five)Anna Kendrick shines in this comedy-musical about an all-girls college singing group competing against their male rivals who always best them. Kendrick plays a freshman named Beca who reluctantly joins the team, giving them the talent and energy they need to put on a good show once again. The film also features Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Rebel Wilson, Skylar Astin, Ben Platt and Adam DeVine. It was directed by Jason Moore and written by Kay Cannon (two former TV filmmakers). It's based on the book of the same name by Mickey Rapkin. I usually stay away from films like this and when I do give one a try I usually find them painfully unfunny and boring. I gave this one a chance because of it's good reviews and solid box-office and was pleasantly surprised. It's very funny and full of likable characters. Nothing spectacular but a decent comedy-musical that's definitely entertaining.Kendrick plays Beca, a new freshman at Barden University who attends the school only at the wishes of her father (John Benjamin Hickey), who is a professor at the university. She dreams of moving to Los Angeles and pursuing a music career so she takes an internship at the school's radio station. There she meets another music lover named Jesse (Astin) who develops a crush on her. Beca doesn't have time for boys though and wants to get to LA as soon as possible. Her father makes an agreement with her that he'll help pay for her to move to Los Angeles if she tries harder at school for one year and joins a club. When the local all girl a cappella group discovers how talented a singer she is they talk her into joining their team. Beca, plus a few other misfit girls (that aren't usually given a chance to sing with the popular girls), give the group just what it needs to finally compete with their male rivals (the Treblemakers), who always win the local competition.The movie is surprisingly witty and fast paced. It's filled with good and likable performances highlighted by Kendrick's soulful lead. Rebel Wilson has been receiving a lot of critical praise for her comedic turn but I think Anna Camp is even funnier as the film's leading female antagonist and Adam DeVine is also a scene stealer as the film's male bad guy. There's plenty of pretty girls to look at; especially Camp, Snow, Kendrick, Alexis Knapp and Elizabeth Banks as a commentator (Banks was also a producer of the film). The performances are equally as likable though. Most of all the movie is just funny. It's been compared to similar films like 'BRING IT ON' and I'd say it's at least as good as that. I'd also put it in the same league as something like 'MEAN GIRLS' or 'CLUELESS'. For it's type it definitely works.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQ4Gr6CX0-g",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Pitch Perfect hits all the right notes!,"Pitch Perfect (2012) it is a musical comedy film and I love it so much. The same way that I love Bring it On (2000) which I love sport films and this is a team completion of a singers on a Capella University. Anna Kendrick is fantastic as Beca Mitchell who changes everything in the singing group. There is a lot of funny moments scenes, this film has a lot chemistry, it is a fun film and the music is good! This film is good I actually don't like music films they aren't my cup of tea. But this film is surprisingly good. I just watched in Friday Pitch Perfect 2 (2015) which was pretty good, I love it, I just love this film much more. Just recently saw this but I love it and have seen the second 3 times already. The singing is good and it's a hilarious movie.There's nothing more refreshing than when a movie pleasantly surprises you, and ""Pitch Perfect"" does exactly that. We've all seen plenty of flicks in which a group of singers or dancers struggle with adversity and end up winning over everyone with their earnest performances.The formula hasn't changed here, but it manages to improve upon it with a hugely entertaining cast, some consistently unpredictable humor, and a series of awesome a Capella musical numbers. Everyone in the film is fantastic, but it's Rebel Wilson who steals the spotlight from everyone as the hilarious Fat Amy. If you thought her lines in the trailer were funny, just wait till you see her in full-fledged action. Anna Kendrick is also memorable as the film's down-to-earth protagonist, as is Elizabeth Banks in a small but enjoyable role as an a Capella commentator. But without a doubt, it's the enjoyable stage performances and impromptu sing-offs that make this flick so much fun to watch. The best battle is in the middle, when the girls go against the guys in a game of song tag. The only thing that sort of drags the movie down is the forgettable side story featuring Anna Kendrick and Skyler Astin, but at least it leads up to a sweet conclusion. With a solidly hilarious script and some phenomenal a Capella numbers, ""Pitch Perfect"" is easily one of the year's most entertaining films, bringing together a strong, original, and eclectic cast with actual singing abilities. Sure, some of the physical gags do go a tad too far at times, but the flick's cheeky sense of comedy and Rebel Wilson's knockout performance make it all worthwhile.Pitch Perfect is Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story for the Glee set. Or the anti-Glee set even, and it's in that tricky middle that director Jason Moore's quasi-irreverent musical comedy sings. It's never quite the pitch-perfect genre it could be -- oh come on, you knew that one was coming -- but it pays just enough respect to raw talent, takes just enough cheap but affectionate shots at the collegiate singing competition circuit, and strikes just enough of a balance to emerge a full-fledged crowd pleaser. Add to that a well-cast ensemble that knows how to earn a laugh and belt a song and a series of a Capella arrangements primed to convert the unconverted, and you have a comedy that deserves a shot.I love this film to death it is my favorite film.Pitch Perfect is a 2012 American musical comedy film directed by Jason Moore.

Fun and uplifting,"This is an amusing, uplifting and really enjoyable movie. I was chuckling throughout. It had a lot of smart and sometimes off-the-wall humour. Yes, it's girly stuff mostly, but it's done in a way that would appeal to anyone.The songs and performances were great. I hope the performances were all real, but you never know of course. And perhaps it doesn't matter.Imagine a university subculture based on a cappella music performances. Really good performances. The students in this subculture are nerds with issues, but sheesh are they talented. And some of them are attractive too. This university has no less than four aca-groups. (Does this sort of subculture really exist at American colleges?) Shows like ""Glee"" and ""America's Got Talent"" are barely on my radar, but even I can tell that this movie is of that ilk.I can't remember the plot. Something about competitions, boy meets girl, letting people in, pleasing dad and not being controlling.All the characters were well portrayed by the various actors, but the one young lady who stood out for me was Brittany Snow (who plays Chloe).

"*Insert ""Aca"" pun here*","I went into Pitch Perfect expecting a very different film. After seeing so many lame, easy-going, fluffy tween pictures that do little to drum up anything but the awareness of the clichés they are heavily relying on, this film is a breath of clean, lively, and somewhat subversive fresh air as it shows a group of collegians in their school's a capella program trying to make it to a prestigious competition and hopefully change the face of the entire a capella world. It's also pretty apparent here that a capella beats all extra circular activities at this college, including football. And even academics.I approached Pitch Perfect with the same hesitation I did Mean Girls, which I went on to dub one of the smartest, most relatable teen movies of the last decade. I feared that Pitch Perfect would become obsessed with the idea of cheekiness, rapidly descending into the bowels of self parody, with jokes that screamed childish and characters that defined caricature. The film is rather cheeky and self-aware, but it presents itself in a light-hearted way, completely knowing its origins, and while respecting them, simultaneously not taking them too seriously, creating warmth and vibrant atmosphere for the film's entire runtime. It understands the inanity of its idea, yet can still conduct itself seriously when needed and jokingly when applicable.The story concerns the fine arts-driven school Barden University, where incoming freshman Beca (the lovely Anna Kendrick) enters with something a little less than a hungry, open mind. Her tuition is free, thanks to her professor father, but she envisions herself in Los Angeles, enjoying the warm sun and pursuing a niche career in music producing. Her father fears that her field is too specific and it's more of a hobby than a formal career (don't get me started on my aspirations, which I'm learning fall along the same lines). Yet we know she's serious; just look at all the hip beats and uniquely composed instrumentals on her laptop, one of which replicating and sampling the fantastic ballad ""I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)"" by The Proclaimers.After seeing her miserable and uninspired after a month of school, Beca's father strikes an abrupt and unusual deal with her; if she can find a club and show genuine passion for it, she can go to Los Angeles and he will help her with her dream of being a producer. She decides to join the Barton Bellas, an a capella team at the college, that made headlines (or blurbs, depending on how seriously a newspaper handles a capella news) after an embarrassing incident at the International Championship of Collegiate A Capella. The Bellas are looking to rebound their reputation of being a joke, and hire Beca as a new member despite her notably quirky, ""alternative"" personality.The leader of the Bellas, a dictating woman named Aubrey (Anna Camp), keeps the group on a very tight schedule that is anything but mailable. She prohibits talking to or ""penetrating"" members of ""The Treblemakers,"" currently the number one a capella group at Bardon University. Unfortunately, Beca has become somewhat entangled with Jesse (Skylar Astin), a charming movie-geek who has fun bringing energy and joy to the students of Bardon. Jesse also takes pride in introducing Beca to the limitless wonders of film scores, telling her that John Hughes' The Breakfast Club has one of the best movie endings of all time. I couldn't agree more. And on a final note, all the a capella tournaments are announced by Elizabeth Banks (who too serves as one of the several producers on this film) and John Michael Higgins, who assume a witty and often charming ""Statler and Waldorf""-like personality during the competitions and clearly have fun reciting the material, which comes off as practically improvised. For all I know, it was.One of the many charmingly realistic things about Pitch Perfect is it steers clear of the typical teen romance trap, and collectively subverts them by staying focused on the misfit Bellas and the competition at hand, rather than the relationships they may go on to form. Consistent readers know how I tire from the incredibly senseless humor that, thanks to attention span-shortening shows like iCarly and Victorious (and if we're talking film, the pathetic Diary of a Wimpy Kid franchise), has now become increasingly common. This was a more mature film than I expected to see, with a stable commentary on the quirks of life and the beauty of being different. Even the film stays away from lackluster character stereotypes, making The Treblemakers pompous and self-consumed, yet truly showing that they have talent and possess serious singing skills.During more than one of the numbers, I questioned how, um, authentic some of this singing was. Sometimes, we can tell that the beautiful Anna Kendrick (who spent much of her teenage years on Broadway) is singing songs like David Guetta's ""Titanium"" and see that The Treblemakers are perfectly recreating a beat-less version of Flo Rida's ""Right Round,"" but at other times we can see that some of the sounds are rather unnatural. Let me just say that the vocals occasionally sound widely overproduced and some of the musical sounds mirror those of synthesizers.Yet this isn't enough of a problem to distract the viewer greatly. Director Jason Moore makes smart decisions about keeping the direction fast-paced, and screenwriter Kay Cannon is aware of the female adolescent culture and can near perfectly replicate it. Not every decision is a surefire hit, seeing as there are far too many jokes about projectile vomit (two instances of it) and one random and unnecessary scene that takes place shortly after the second instance. Regardless, it can be noted that Pitch Perfect is one of the most impressive and complete tween efforts of the year, showing little immaturity, but a grand amount of understanding of the increasingly complex teenage demographic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

But since this is a positive review I will simply say this:This movie is super entertaining. Sing-a-long... I know you know the lyrics ;) End of story!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Very good!,"I feel embarrassed that I liked this movie so much, but I did and I do!!Such a fun movie!!!So watchable! And it's so easy to keep re-watching it when it comes on!!All 3 in the series are great!Excellent movie, funny and fun!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Predictable, To the Point, and did I mention AMAZING!!!!!!","Just saw this movie and I got exactly what I wanted from it. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen and it had a very predictable plot. However, as stated in the heading, this movie is amazing.What makes this movie work so well is the perfect cast, great acapella music, and of course the incredible Fat Amy. Also this movie is very to the point. What I mean by that is there are no scenes that aren't vital to the plot of the movie. The movie could not have been a minute shorter without some serious plot holes. That was the only surprising part of the movie was how fast it progressed. It was very clever of the writers to do it that way because of the predictable ""underdog rising to the top"" type of film it is that everyone has seen before.This movie will keep you laughing, thoroughly entertained and if you are like me, you will be very anxious to see what the Bellas end up putting together at the end.Back to Fat Amy for a minute, what can I say, she's hilarious. I see Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy) as a female Chris Farley for this generation. I predict she will become a huge star in the years to come and everyone will know her name.I recommend this to anyone for a good movie experience. If you are a Glee fan, or a music fanatic, you will especially love this movie as much as I did.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Surprisingly funny and fun,"When I decided to watch this with my cousins(who are all girls) I thought it would just be some dumb chic flick girl musical type thing. But damn was I wrong. This movie is hilarious and the musical numbers are amazing. The cast all shine but the top prize definitely goes to Rebel Wilsons Fat Amy who steals every scene. The movie focuses on a girl called Becca(expertly played by Anna Kendrick) as she starts her life in college. She reluctantly joins the all girl occepela group, The Barden Bellas, as they try to claim their title. The song sequences are awesome and the jokes are really funny. The entire cast shine. I think what makes the film so funny is the diversity of the Bellas. There is the lesbian, the fat one, the slut, the control freak, the rebel and the goofy quiet one. Basically it is a funny musical and I hope the sequel is just as good as this!",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
It's so WONDERFUL!!!!!,"This movie wasn't shown in Japan, so I saw it when I went to France in March, 2013.I love this movie because there are a lot of my favorite songs in the story. Especially, I like ""Just The Way You Are"" which is sung by Bruno Mars originally. Bellas' voice was so nice and I was moved when I listened to it for the first time.Also, the final performances of the Bellas and the Troublemakers was wonderful. I really like it!!!!I recommend all people who loves comedy and A Capella to watch this movie. If you are interested in it, please check it out!:)",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Just Not Very Good!,"I'm not here to rain on someone's parade. If you enjoy this kind of stuff, it's OK with me. But I don't understand how something so inane could be so popular. It fails on so many levels. First of all, there is absolutely no realistic character development. These kids are just boring. They are types, thrown together because of their quirkiness, their ethnicity, their race, or even their sexual preference. The sad thing is that doing this doesn't lead to anything interesting. Ooh! You mean a fat girl could actually be talented!! I'll admit they have good voices, but so does everyone else in this film. So, where's the conflict? The leader threw up as they were performing for a national championship and is trying to get a second chance? Then there's the sullen main character. I got tired of her and her whiny portrayal in about five minutes. I couldn't care less if they won because I didn't like any of them. Throw in those boorish idiot commentators who never say one funny thing the whole show, and it becomes a snoozefest. A couple numbers are OK but there is no suspense or interest built up. When the big face off comes, we don't wonder for a second what is going to happen.",4.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"I hate glee and any other kind of musical, but this I Loved!","Seriously I saw this in the theater and again now that it's on HBO and I loved every minute of it.

It was hilarious and even a little sweet which I usually am disgusted with but it wasn't over the top or the main focus so was just enough. Anyone complaining about being offended needs to lighten up, it's just a movie and isn't meant to be a statement or something just jokes and a good time. Seriously I swear some of these reviews on here are ridiculous, people just trying to find a problem or point out offensive behavior where there is none!

In My Top 10 Favourite Films,"Pitch Perfect is easily the most enjoyable film of 2012, Pitch Perfect isn't Glee or any of that annoying rubbish, it's something different, it's as eventful as the Eurovision and as entertaining as putting Britain's Got Talent and X-Factor together. An exceptional ensemble of hugely talented actresses own the stage/screen taking chart topping hits and mixing them up with an extraordinary style. It's unpredictable, crazy funny and there's a great pace to it, no boring moments, just all out fun. There are very few moments where some of the male singing is cringe and hard to listen to, but the cast's comedy timings more than make up for that. Anna Kendrick is brilliant, Rebel Wilson is hilarious, her one liners, stage strutting madness and overall nuttiness will have you howling with laughter, same with the Chinese girl whose whispers everything, and then suddenly bursts into song, this movie is so uplifting. Brittany Snow, Alexis Knapp and the whole Bella group are spectacular, they are so entertaining to watch. The song performances are so infectiously brilliant that you can't help but sing along. I guarantee you'll be smiling throughout, and the ending at the finals is 10 minutes of musical greatness, I was smiling the whole way, a must see movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A ca Awesome!,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie, the previews didn't give you a good idea of what it was about, so I kind of skipped seeing this one in theaters and waited for it to come out on DVD. I threw it on my laptop while my boyfriend was playing video games because I like to catch up on my girly movies when he does that...needless to say, he stopped playing halfway through and made me stream it to the TV. This movie is gold! It's hilarious, it has great music AND mashup music which is my favorite, awesome actors make appearances at random (MCLOVIN!) and it by no means is a girly movie. My boyfriend is the manliest they can come and he likes it so much that just last night I caught it on HBO while he was on his way to bed and he stayed up to watch it for our third time with me. It's hard to say what the best part of the movie is...the hilarious commentators, Rebel Wilson who makes me geek out even when she doesn't say anything, the music or the disgusting (yet funny) vomit scenes. This movie will inspire younger people to get into A Capella, without it being too much of a corny musical. This is now one of my new favorite movies and I highly recommend for teens and up!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"1/2 bad, 1/2 good, ending wrecks it","I came into this movie thinking that it was going to be horrible. The first half of the movie was very boring and had bad jokes, bad performances and made me want to fall asleep.Then the 2nd half was the exact opposite with it having good performances, funny jokes and the cast at it's max when it comes to entertainment.Then ending screwed it all over.If it has a goo ending i would give this movie a 6 but it was terrible so it gets a 3 from me.I hope there is no sequel either",3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Great family movie!,"To those that think that this movie will suck (like I did before watching), you won't be disappointed. During a family party, we were deciding to pick a movie to watch just to pass some time and do something. We chose Pitch Perfect and I never seen the movie, but just looking at the cover just gave me an immediate dissatisfied reaction.However, I was TOTALLY wrong. As the movie progresses, I was getting more into it and whenever someone said something I hushed at them xP. It's very interesting and the musical performances are great and sound amazing. Some songs will just get you and give you goosebumps. I recommend this movie for those watching with a group and some children, everyone will be happy and entertained.On the other hand, don't expect an ""Oscar-type"" movie but rather an enjoyable, pleasing, and feel-good type of movie. Yes, you can already predict what's going to happen and how it will end, but that's not what it's meant to do.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
I cannot get enough,"I loved it. I've seen it like four times. I downloaded some of the music to my iPod. I heard ""You're Gonna Miss Me When I'm Gone"" on the radio on the drive in yesterday. That was a moment. Someone has picked it up... Yep it's on the internet. That was nice. Good story, good characters, good acting. What am I saying; it's all music. If you only know two songs and one of them is Yankee Doodle and the other isn't you will not like this. I love the shower scene. That little red haired girl can sing. There is better music out there and I want it. Oh cool, all 2:41 of the shower scene is on YouTube. That tall brunette is about a 10; wish there were more of her. It reminds me of my ""Pump Up the Volume"" experience. Like every radio station claims to play the most music but it's all inane chatter or worse. Seriously hello MORE MUSIC! I must warn you.

There's a weird love story which seems rushed and unconvincing.When I bring this film up with my friends, they either love it, or they say ""it's OK, but Rebel Wilson is hilarious"". I don't find her funny at all. She basically just makes fat jokes. This in and of itself is not a bad thing, I love fat jokes! Make a good fat joke and I'm the guy at the back laughing the most (I'm aware that I'm a loser). But these jokes just aren't funny.So, 3/10, probably because I'm too old.

Title says it all,"And it's not talking about the lead actress in here. While I do love Anna Kendrick, the movie has a phenomenal cast throughout. It's not a ""musical"" mind you (something that has been mentioned here by other reviewers), but it does have singing in it. It is a comedy version of the recent dance movies we have seen. Of course there is also dancing in this one and there is romance in it too.While the romance part does not work quite as well (mostly towards the end of the movie) like the rest of it, it doesn't really take much away from it either.

So I was happily surprised when I found that it was hilarious, quotable, had great taste in music (not something you can about every film, eh?), great cast and characters and good sideline romance. Also, there were some improvised lines by Rebel Wilson aka Fat Amy, that were pure gold...Recommend to anyone, especially other girls my age!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A truly excellent performance by Rebel Wilson,"*The Quickie* 8/10 – Definitely a must watch. Catch it this weekend people!*Pros* Great performances Excellent performance by Rebel Wilson*Cons* Average story Bland characters*Pitch Perfect* The trailer for this movie, while interesting at first, got me really jaded recently because it kept being played everywhere. Also, while the jokes in the trailer were funny, there wasn't really much to it. Pitch Perfect looked like your typical dance movie, except with A Cappella singing.I am very happy to say that Pitch Perfect is a fantastic movie and I had an incredibly enjoyable time watching it.*Synopsis* Beca (ANNA KENDRICK) is a freshman in college and is one of the new recruits of the A Cappella group known as the Barden Bellas. The Bellas are led by senior Aubrey (ANNA CAMP) who is looking to prove herself after choking during the previous year's competition finals thereby costing the Bellas the competition.However, Beca soon realises that Aubrey's insistence on sticking to old and tired routines is proving detrimental to the group. With their rival group, The Treblemakers, being as good as they are, the Bellas have to come together to come up with a new routine that is good enough to win them the national A Cappella championships.*Review* To be honest, I really wanted to hate this movie. I've never been a huge fan of dance movies and thisIn all fairness, the story isn't anything original. It's the same cookie-cutter story about how a newcomer to an underdog team inspires the team to come together and they eventually go on to beat the odds and win the championship (and no, I'm not spoiling anything). It's not a literary masterpiece but it works and is actually really competently written.The actual singing and performances I thought were really good. Sure, there were some songs that were just alright but for the most part, the scenes with the characters singing A Cappella were goosebump-inducingly enjoyable and I loved every second of it. There is some dance choreography in here as well but it isn't all that great and takes a backseat to the singing.I think special mention has to be given to the character of Fat Amy (REBEL Wilson). This one character was what made this movie as good as it is. A lot of the jokes in this movie were written around this character and the jokes themselves are hilariously crafted. Rebel Wilson absolutely killed this performance. Her deadpan delivery of already well-written jokes was such a delight to watch. It's been a really long time since a movie made me laugh that hard.However, I have to say that the other characters weren't all that interesting. The main protagonist, Beca, is likable enough but there isn't anything very interesting about her character to make her stand out from any other protagonist in this type of movies. The same can be said for her love interest, Jess (SKYLAR ASTIN).In addition, while a lot of time is spent on Beca and Jesse, and to some extent Aubrey, the other characters have almost no character development. You never get any idea who these people really are other than what archetype they're supposed to be. For example, you get the girl who is extremely promiscuous, a very masculine lesbian, a soft- spoken Asian, etc. I guess it's good that they're different enough from each other so I could at least tell them apart that way. Other than that, nothing else is made known about these characters.*Rating* I really enjoyed this movie and thoroughly enjoyed sitting through this. The performances were entertaining and the jokes were awesome. While there are certain flaws to this movie, that doesn't detract from the fact that this is a fantastic movie and deserves to be watched.I rate this movie a high 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"Funny, clever, and a joy to watch","Pitch Perfect is one of the best comedy film I've seen in recent years. Not only was it funny but it was also very clever and the actresses performances were quite good. Anna Kendrick was definitely the best out of all of them. I loved the way she performed as the main character. Her best scene was singing her hit song ""Cups"". Fat Amy, on the other hand, was the funniest of all. She manages to deliver some of the funniest one liners ever.The movie is very similar to the television show Glee, mainly because of its charm and its plot centered on singing. The singing and dancing were very decent but the best scene I would say would be the scene when the girls are trying out during the auditions. This is the scene that made me laugh the most. The scene with the girl vomiting profusely in the midst of the girls arguing was also pretty funny as well.I recommend this movie everyone, especially teens.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

BORING,"This movie is listed as a ""comedy"" a ""romance"" and ""music."" Unfortunately, its barely one of the three.Comedy - There is maybe one joke that made me laugh (the bit where the guy pulls a rodent out of his pocket way at the beginning) but otherwise I was so bored watching this. Someone being fat is not funny. Someone being gay is not funny. Someone being quiet is not funny. Someone being slightly out of the social norms is not a joke. I would be offended, but they don't go anywhere near far enough with anything for it to even qualify as shock humor. They went pretty far with all the puke (yes there are multiple scenes of projectile vomiting in this movie) and its just really, really gross. Shock humor needs to be funny. There has to be a set up and pay off. There has to be A J O K E. (Also, with gross-out, the characters in the show or movie need to be more grossed out than the audience - That's just a basic writing tip for anyone interested in comedy.) Most of the characters who witness the vomit are pretty cool with it. This movie does not work as a comedy.Romance - This movie isn't a romance. I don't know why its listed as that. Its kind of confusing.Music - This music is basically a series of really short music videos strung together by overlong and boring skits full of bad acting and filler.I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you want to take a nap. Its really boring, painfully unfunny and uncreative. There is really no reason to watch this movie when there are so many better pieces of media you could be watching.",3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Good for a chuckle,"Just finished watching Pitch Perfect. Had no clue what to expect. It was highly recommended from a friend, but not given any insight before watching. Must say I was pleasantly surprised. I mean, I wasn't bowled over in tears laughing, but it certainly was funny. Slapstick comedy with physical humor and the singer's voices were pretty good. Long and short of the story is a bunch of college kids competing to win every singing competition. Winning seems to be the most important thing in life. Ironically, the only link to the college is the campus setting. We don't see them attend even one class. It's all about outdoing each other's team.

First call Pitches,"You have to hand it to ""Pitch Perfect."" It's a twentysomething song-and-dance movie built around rival a cappella groups. That's more exciting than dueling string quartets, I suppose - but no, the quartets would be performing better material. In the world of this film's Barden College, a cappella seems to rank above football in extracurricular activities, and as nearly as I recall, the only character ever seen in a classroom is Beca's father, the teacher. Beca is recruited into the Bellas by its star, Chloe (Brittany Snow), while they are both naked in a shower, which makes this more intriguing than your average a cappella recruitment. Well, at least it's an afterschool activity. Soon she finds herself up against Aubrey (Anna Camp), the group leader who has rigid opinions about their performances. Strange supporting roles are played by John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks, as a team of commentators who function somewhere between play-by-play announcers and the judges on ""American Idol."" The Higgins performance owes more than a little to Fred Willard's unforgettable dog show commentary in ""Best in Show,"" but it was clear that Willard was part of a telecast. Still, Anna Kendrick is adorable, a young version of the angelic Marisa Tomei. And it must be said that the Bellas are a first-rate group, with choreography so crisp that Bob Fosse couldn't have drilled them to move more precisely. You may be reminded of a Broadway musical. Certainly the choreography is way over the top of other championship a cappella teams on You Tube. And if I mistake not, the soundtrack sneaks in some percussion and other stray sounds that might get the Bellas outlawed in a real a cappella competition.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"A Great, But Not Quite Perfect Movie","Two years after Anna Kendrick won her best supporting actress Oscar in Up In The Air, Kendrick headlined this acapella based movie to near perfection. With plenty of great singing voices and what appears to be a deliberate attempt to avoid the traditional storyline of the popular drama outline and romantic relationships, along with good casting, there is a refreshing, and more than an original note in the air about this movie. Nevertheless, there is a discordant note with the inclusion of perhaps unnecessary grossness in several scenes due to perhaps the comparative inexperience of the director as well as an underdeveloped DJ career that Kendrick's character sought instead of the more polished but subtle 2006 Devil Wears Prada version. What also stands out is the atypical avoidance of scanty female costumes often used to capture the more sensual attention of viewers instead allowing the strength of the vocals to rightly take main stage. A great, if not quite perfect, light and serious musical drama.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
A crowd pleaser that makes its clichés work and stays consistently funny,"Just from the premise of ""Pitch Perfect"" you can probably predict what the storyline will be like. What you won't see coming is how cleverly written, funny and well performed the film is. I have a theory that for every genre, for every story that's been done time and time again, for every cliché there has to be a few instances where all the pieces fall together so well that you won't mind that you will be able to tell where everything is going. As evidence to back up my theory, I present to you this film.Beca (Anna Kendricks) dreams of making it big in the music industry and is reluctantly attending college as per her father's demands. In an effort to make the year more bearable she joins an all-female a cappella group (the members include Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, Rebel Wilson, Ester Dean, Alexis Knapp, Hana Mae Lee, Kelly Alice Jakle, Wanetah Walmsley and Shelley Regner). This rag-tag group is disorganized and can barely get through a single song... You might call them underdogs. With a bit of practice and bonding though, the Barden Bellas might stand a chance of beating their rivals and winning the national competition.I had heard good things about the picture prior to going to see it, but this musical comedy caught me totally off-guard. The a cappella musical pieces are well sung, original and (when dance is involved) well choreographed. I thought the bits where everyone sings were well integrated into the story too. The writing is very smart, particularly when it comes to the jokes. We have everything from witty plays on words to inappropriate surprise humor with a bit of gross-out thrown in as well and even some a cappella puns. I found the soundtrack to be particularly enjoyable, which should be a given considering it's a musical, but it deserves special mention nonetheless. This is a film that will have a lot of re-watch value because you're going to want to memorize and sing along with the characters at home and with your friends. The numbers are catchy and are truly original because they're not just covers of popular songs done without instruments, they're often remixed or mashed-up In clever ways and often, their inclusion comes as a laugh-out-loud punchline.I found the film to be consistently funny because it knows how ridiculous the premise is. A cappella competitions taken as seriously as college football? It's ludicrous and everyone here knows it. Instead of rolling your eyes as you would in something like ""Yu-Gi-Oh! The movie"" though, you embrace the characters with open arms, you sing along with them and you get excited to see the film play out the way it's going to because in this case that's the way you WANT it to play out. Not all of the jokes work but the performances alone make it worth seeing. You'll have a great time and more than a few laughs with it.

Mediocre,"This is a musical comedy film about vocal groups at a university. It's not funny enough for a comedy.

The cast does a good job playing their roles, though at times the characters can feel a little one dimensional. The plot is simple yet enjoyable. But what makes the movie the most for me is the music. I might just be a sucker for A Capella (which is weird seeing that I don't listen to it ever) but the soundtrack to the film is great.Overall, if you haven't seen this movie in a while or ever, and want to feel good at the end, I would recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Despite their shaky beginnings, the misfit singers come together & eventually decide to ""be original"". But just because it's clichéd doesn't mean ""Pitch Perfect"" isn't a great film! The film has a great cast full of fun colorful characters. Rebel Wilson in particular is hilarious as ""Fat Amy"" delivering most if not all the laughs. There's plenty of musical sets, most of which are pretty entertaining. Basically, the film is like an infinitely better, much longer episode of ""Glee"".This film delivers exactly what you expect!",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Great and funny,"Well I saw this movie today, and I'll say that Anna Kendeick has still the most beautiful smile that has seen in the movies after Ingrid Bergman. Just the smile... Well, the movie is so predictable all the way, so I think this is not a spoiler. Bit boring occasionally, but I think this is the first movie in a long time where there was no kissing! Kissing makes the movie slow and stupid-musicated, Musicish? Anyway, this is the most enjoyable movie, if you don*t seek any ""artsy"" stuff. This is just an entertaining comedy with a flow. Story is predictable, but it is well done. 2 stars gor the smile of Anna Kendrick, one star for the music. 5 stars go to the director for making this movie bit interesting and funny that it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Literal greatest movie of all time,I have seen this movie close to thirty times. It is a masterpiece and will forever be the greatest movie ever created. No notes.This movie forever changed the way I perceive media. Every movie I have watched since watching Pitch Perfect are always compared to it. My brain chemistry was completely altered and I never want it to change back. Thank you to Universal Studios for making this sensational piece of film.The casting on this movie was incredible. Ben Platt and Rebel Wilson are iconic in their roles and they portrayed them perfectly. I will forever be grateful for this movie and for all it has done for me.,10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"PitchPerfect is an extraordinary, sensational musical comedy-drama - a total surprise!","I had NO idea what a fantastic movie I was about to watch when I rented PitchPerfect. I was looking for something other than the dark dramas that are the rave the last few years, and I'd just read Anna Kenndrick's IMDb bio, so I had to give this movie a try. What I thought would be an entertaining movie turned out to be an INSTANT addition to the list of my all-time ""Best Movies I Ever Saw"" list.PitchPerfect is an extraordinary, sensational musical comedy-drama - a total surprise hit. It has a solid plot, genius blend of actors and actresses that represent the quirks, humor, talent, personality traits that anyone can relate to - blended to present a visually artistic, inspiring, and unforgettable experience for the audience. I have watched the movie almost 30 times already - and each time, it makes me laugh, and feel those warm fuzzies and goosebumps during the outstanding climax.It is SO hard to find an artistic and inspirational movie these days, especially regarding music and dance, portraying the depth and inspiration of a character who attains the dream of reaching their full potential of their natural talent. This movie delivers that promise with an awe-inspiring, unexpected thrilling climax that'll have you cheering, jumping up and dancing with them, sharing in the joy of their success.I cannot finish my review without mentioning the following worthy ""traits"" that made this movie such a hit: 1. Rebel Wilson is FANTASTIC, hysterical, lovable - personifying the human nature to overcome one's tendency to feel self-conscious when life hasn't dealt you what society values today. SHE is beautiful, funny, extremely self-confident, and in-touch with herself, exemplifying that we each are special, unique and very worthy if YOU believe you are. 2. Gail and John, the ""DJ's"" for the Acapella competitions are a total RIOT! Listen carefully to their witty commentary. 3. Anna Kendrick displays yet more of her exceptional talents - not just acting, but what a voice! 4. Aubrey and Chloe - ALL the Barden Bellas have amazing voices! The same goes for the Treble-makers.I'm so glad they are making a sequel, and so looking forward to it. This movie is sure to be a hit for ANYONE and everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

A great teen flick for all,"Lately, the movie industry has been preying on teens with stupid, underdeveloped, and unoriginal films. Pitch Perfect is a stylish and bouncy film about a cappella singing groups who know how to make a show. Though the story is not necessarily original, the way the film is presented is what makes it thrive. Rebel Wilson and Hana Mae Lee practically own this film with their hilarious performances. Anna Kendrick is as impressive as ever. Brittany Snow shows off her talents of singing and acting. Overall, this is a fun film to watch. If the singing and remixes of songs don't get to you, the characters and little love story will. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to enjoy themselves and get a very good laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Cute and funny, great date movie.. reminded me of Mean Girls","Go see this!Pitch Perfect is a fun comedy with some great songs and good characters, but it still gives a predictable story. This movie is one of the best comedies of the 2012 and gave me some great moments to remember, and even being a guy I felt this was a fun movie. I sometimes enjoy comedies that are aimed at females, like how I even enjoyed Mean girls because it was a good high school comedy. Its also got a lot of heart between its characters so its not one of those comedies that has no soul. Its a goofy comedy with jokes aimed at singers, movies, and a lot of other pop culture references. The story has a romantic interest between the two main characters, which was predictable as usual and I felt it could've been left out of the movie. I also could've been fine without all the vomit jokes. Its true genius lies in the performances of its actors, which includes the hilarious Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy who just steals the movie completely. I enjoyed the performance from Anna Kendrick who is sweet and lovable as always, and Skylar Astin who was a fun actor to watch. John Michael Higgins and Elizabeth Banks also were great as the announcers for the competitions, and they return to the screen together after the 2007 film Fred Claus. Another hilarious performance came from Adam DeVine who plays on the show Workaholics, and uses his comedic talents in this film. I loved all the cover songs, and I felt they really did a good job at singing. The finale of the movie gave me goosebumps, and I was surprised that they were able to do this. Pitch Perfect was a fun film to watch and I had a great time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

The writing is hilarious, there are many scenes that had me in stitches and also some parts that were so good simply because of how unexpected they were.The main girls are immensely talented,they were well able to both sing and dance, they all stand out in their own way and this movie really helped them showcase their talent.Pure fun and entertainment, Pitch Perfect is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good comedy.An aspiring musician tries to add a touch of cool to her college accapella group.Best Performance: Anna Kendrick",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Wauw that was just awful,"The movie sucked.. the singing sucked, acting sucked, the theme sucked and the storyline sucked. I thought lets have a look what kind of a grade IMDb gives this shitty movie and when i saw the 7.5 which is completely idiotic i thought lets give it a fair grade.. however it seems you can't go lower than a 1.0. Probably teen chicks who give this movie a high rating because the movie blew chunks..letterly and figurly. The end ""song"" was absolutely awful. Breakfast club theme? There is no way in hell to mix that into a cool mix. It was just a painful try to make an over the top comedy version of Glee. It's a f-ing joke that this crappy movie has the same rating as comedies like 'The hangover'. Still trying to figure out which movie sucked more any Twilight movie or this. It has to be a draw.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
a perfect ten,"i hate musicals, generally, but i freakin' loved this movie. the plot may be ""formulaic"" but honestly, all plots are derivative; it's been said there are really only the same stories, told over and over again throughout history. the acapella performances are stellar, making me an instant fan, but even better, the multidimensional and highly original CHARACTERS are simply amazingly fun to watch. This is a fantastic comedy, lighthearted without being simply fluffy. It does not take itself too seriously and yet is executed with enormous creativity and integrity. The chemistry among the players here is phenomenal. Fat Amy is the BOMB, i'd never seen Rebel Wilson before, i fell completely in love, and Fat Amy not my only favorite character. Rarely have I seen a film where not only the leads are engaging but every single supporting player has some special and intriguing quality. Every performer shines here. I enjoy a lot of comedies, but not many make me laugh out loud multiple times. The humor ranges from outrageous to quotable to subtle (""we've been here the whole time"") to simply visual to the simply strange but it all works. And I love the cultural references. Producers hit this baby out of the park, and Elizabeth Banks (producer) with John Michael Higgins has some of the funniest lines in the whole movie as well!",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

I first watched this because a friend recommended it to me. I thought it would be you average cheesy chick flick movie and that you knew how it would all pan out but it surprised me and that's one of the reasons why I love it. Every second you fall off of your seat because anything that comes out of Rebel Wilson's mouth is pure comic genius. My personal favorite character is Stacie because she brings a lot of funny moments and fat Amy (who is Rebel Wilson's character) is a close second. But please check this movie out, I'm positive it will be one of your favorite movies too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Really fun comedy with good singing.,"Growing up I liked the trilogy and this month I decided to go back and rewatch each of the three Pitch Perfect movies. Pitch Perfect is by far the easiest to watch, the all female main cast provides a funny film with lots of funny moments where I belly laughed. The singing on top of that is really nice from all of the groups that sung. Only problems I have with it is the cheesy romance dynamic between Anna and Skylar, I'm not too fond of it too be perfectly honest. As well as the ""scene"" if you watched the movie you might know what I'm talking about. It was disgusting but also entertaining, but mainly disgusting. The chemistry between the cast is also great, as it makes it all the more entertaining. Especially between the characters of Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins. Listening to them commentate while providing a bunch of nonsensical and crude jokes will always be funny to me. Overall, the movie is fun and entertaining, giving me a fun time to turn my brain off and just laugh.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Music For The Mind and Ears!,"Pitch Perfect happened to come out of nowhere by surprising people on how great this film actually is. I know people were not expecting much from the trailers, but this is a film that comes straight from the heart. I am not a fan of today's music, but I do like a cappella and there is some talent here. There are several top-tapping songs that you can sing and dance along with. The characters are surprisingly relatable and depending on what kind of person you are, there is someone here you can relate with.This film is about a girl named Beca who is starting college against her own will. She is recruited to a women's a cappella team, the Barden Bellas because of her singing talent. Now with her involved, it's up to them to win the national championship.This film has some solid acting. Anna Kendrick is really good in the lead role and I never thought of her as a good singer. Some noticeable stand-outs amongst the team is Brittany Snow as the mean-spirited Aubrey and Rebel Wilson as the funny Fat Amy.Overall, this happens to be a better, much better musical than expected. It may have a formulaic plot, but the fine performances and the abundance of comedy overcomes that issue. It's a funny and moving portrait of life in a modern college society. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Great film!,"Change is effective. When you encouraged change, you become versatile and flexible. In reality, when we are unwilling to quickly adjust to the new challenges that change offers us, we feel vulnerable, insecure, and disoriented. When we accept change, we are open-minded to a variety of situations, audiences, and experiences and lean into the opportunities they bring. Because she was still striving to make up for the defeat that the Bellas encountered last year as a result of Aubrey getting sick in the middle of the performance, Aubrey was perpetually overwhelmed and obsessed on perfecting the same medley. Because Beca was daring and out of her control, she was intimidated by her.

A well created and unique coming of age picture that I would strongly recommend,"Pitch Perfect (2012) is a movie that my daughter and I recently watched together on Netflix. The storyline follows a new student at a college who wants to quit but is convinced by her dad to give it one more year and that she needs to join a club to better understand what college is about. She joins a singing team that is renowned for struggling and wanting to be better than they are. Can she learn something from the group and vice versa?This picture is directed by Jason Moore (Shotgun Wedding) and stars Anna Kendrick (Up in the Air), Brittany Snow (Hairspray), Rebel Wilson (Jojo Rabbit), Alexis Knapp (Couple's Retreat), Ben Platt (Drunk Parents) and Skylar Astin (21 & Over).This is honestly an easy movie to enjoy. The writing of both the storyline, circumstances and dialogue is unique and clever. The cast is perfectly selected and fit the characters to perfection. Even the side characters are compelling and hilarious - I adored Hana Mae Lee in this. Her vomit scene is legendary. There's a great fight scene in here that cracked me up too. I can't say enough good things about this soundtrack as well.Overall, this is a well created and unique coming of age picture that I would strongly recommend. I would score this a 7.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
First-class vocals and inventive arrangements,"This movie had a few twists (no spoilers here) but the script wasn't brilliant (except, who can deny the charm of much of the effervescent cast? Even Adam DeVine crushed his stereotypical role), but the vocals and especially the a cappella arrangements were spot on. No credit to the vocal coaches and/or arrangers?I enjoyed what it offers immensely. What it lacked was immaterial. Congratulations to all involved. 8/10 stars from a tough critic. A solid addition to a lot of talented people's filmographies.Again, I could pick nits with the lack of detail in the credits, but that's not a major distraction compared to this overall fun YA romp.Now I suppose that I'm obliged to watch PP 2 (2015) and 3 (2017).

Shallow,"After joining a college all girl a cappella group Beca (Anna Kendrick) sees the group going nowhere unless some changes are made.How many of you knew there were a cappella singing groups on college campuses? Everyone I asked had no idea there were such things. I didn't either. Yet, in here a big deal is made of them and we see several groups vying for first prize in the Nationals.What was wrong. The Barden Bellas, the group Beca joins hurt themselves the previous year when one of the lead singers vomited all over the stage during the finals. A new group was formed. Aubrey (Anna Camp) the leader, kept insisting on the same songs to win the competitions. Beca disagreed and felt a new direction was needed.The music and choreography were passable but one did notice a lot of lip syncing. One girl, who no one could hear because her words went back into her mouth as soon as they were spoken, was also a member of the group. Why? She couldn't project anything. Oh, I see, that was supposed to be funny? It wasn't .This was intended to be a comedy, but there was nothing funny anywhere. The script is shallow with Beca not wanting to be in college in the first place and has an on-going battle with her father regarding this. Rebel Wilson, who played Fat Amy, tried to lighten things up but that didn't work out. The girl who did vomit angels wasn't funny at all. Vomit Angels? Give me a break. The romantic angle with Beca and Jesse (Skylar Astin) was too contrived to be a serious thing and we just didn't care.With a title as Pitch Perfect I expected something more along the lines of the King's Singers who are the best at a cappella singing. Something.something close. Didn't happen. (3/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Looking a bit tired there...,"I'm sure I don't need to tell you that this film wouldn't even exist if not for Glee. We have a team of misfit girls including a gay one, a fat one, a quiet psychopath, a projectile vomiter etc. who take on professional singing harmony groups in a contest. They start off terrible, and are the laughing stock of the school. But gradually, when the leader of this kooky troupe realises that OTHER PEOPLE'S ideas besides hers could work, and when they APPRECIATE THEIR OWN UNIQUE SKILLS while BONDING AS A UNIT, things start to click. Then come the final contest... they finish last before killing themselves. I kid, I kid.There is a tune in this movie called The Cup Song in which an auditionee for the competition improvises using only a beaker to perform a catchy little ditty. This has quickly become a much imitated fad on Youtube, with many wannabees trying (and usually failing) to copy the scene. It's a shame then, that the rest of the screenplay is as predictable as Katie Price's latest pregnancy, being stuffed full of obvious jokes and hoary old plot devices. The production numbers are good, even show-stopping in some cases, but is that enough to recommend it? Not really.Still, if you're young and haven't yet been rendered a cynical Statler and Waldorf clone by this strange, cruel world, you might be able to enjoy it more.

One Of The Best Movies Of All Times!!,"I'm not ashamed to admit that I've seen this multiple times and it gets better on each viewing. On paper, this all looks oh-so High School Musical: The College Years, but the beauty of Pitch Perfect is they way it turns its formulaic moments into unexpected hilarity. There are great moments and the songs are well put together and catchy. m would enjoy. It held my interest throughout and i think it was well produced. Filled with exciting musical numbers and solid performances from Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson as Fat Amy, the adorable Skylar Kenstin as Beccas love interest and so many others Pitch perfect is something truly special. Not to say t's flawless it's a little amateur in spots and Brittany Snow's character feels a little confusing.

Great movie,"Now I saw this film a lot later than most people meaning a lot of it was ruined for me by friends quoting it and pictures of the quotes.

That meant when I eventually came to watching it I was a little disappointed.I thought it was going to be the next ""Mean Girls"", where when asked if you've watched ""Pitch Perfect"" you'd reply ""who hasn't watched Pitch Perfect?"" (which my cousin did so when I'd asked if she'd seen ""Mean Girls"", bearing in mind none of them have seen ""Pitch Perfect""). ""Mean Girls"" is the most quotable movie of all time people could say, but saying ""Pitch Perfect"" is a close second you'd be lying.Even so, within the week I watched the film 3 or 4 days in a row whilst packing for my cadets camp and I've already watched it once again since coming back a week ago.All the singing is great and I especially liked the scenes revolving around ""The Breakfast Club"" as I also love that movie.Without Skylar Astin (Jesse) and Rebel Wilson (Fat Amy), this film would've been terrible. Astin is a great actor and was definitely the best singer in the whole film, his voice is amazing.

A capella group trying to win the national competition.,"I really enjoyed this movie. I felt that it handled the expected comedy very well. The music performed was exceptional. The cast was one of the best possible. When I first went in to view this movie I did not expect it to be phenomenal but it exceeded all expectations.The movie is based off the oncoming popularity wave of Capella music. The main character, Beca, is one of those college students that doesn't really want to be there but is forced to. Her father makes a deal with her, saying that if she joins a club and really works at it he will help her move to LA and quit college.All round, a great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
watched this again and again ... and again,"i can say that this movie is one of those that never fails to entertain me. ohwell, i guess i'm just green with envy and i can't help but wish i am someone like them who can just belt out songs acapella style pronto and with perfect beats and rhythms to match. Reality Sinks in, knocks and tells me to quit daydreaming.now that i'm slapped awake, the movie's on the average, really. not much to rave about but i guess it is well appreciated, mostly by me, i guess. i like that there's a bit of development in the story. there's reason behind their actions and they somehow improve and learn from whatever it is they were dealing with. they learn team work and unity and blah, blah, blah. the unity of their group is probably the breaking point of the story that made me excited as to what performance they'll pull off.the only thing that left a bad taste in my me about this movie was the exaggerated barf scenes.

Hilarious and Enticing,"Before watching Pitch Perfect, I was a bit skeptical. It didn't really look that great, but my views quickly changed. While watching, I found myself laughing until I couldn't breathe. The lines were delivered perfectly, for the casting was done to a point. The story line got a bit muddled at times but was quickly covered up by some more hilarious dialog. Many of the comedic moments can be repeated among friends and they'll be funny all the same. I felt that the character development was also done well, with good amounts of growth and diversity. I give Pitch Perfect a 9/10 only because of the slightly muffled story line. The story will surely be corrected in the upcoming 2015 sequel, Pitch Perfect 2. On the whole, Pitch Perfect is a movie for all of those who like to laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Not funny and not about singing,"I watched this movie yesterday and I couldn't find almost any humour in it. I giggled a couple of times and that's it. About the musical side, I think that good singers sing for the love of music itself, not to celebrate themselves, which appears to be what moves those ""singers"" instead. Singing it's a matter of heart, not only of vocal cords, a thing that x-factor-like performers, like the characters of this movie, fail to understand. In my opinion these kind of performances should be held in circuses, because of the kind of skills involved.Anyway I suppose it's a passable teenager movie, but not for particularly bright kids, which can choose among many other better movies if they're interested in music.",4.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Better than Glee,"For people who think that movie is nothing more than Glee goes to college, you people are half- wrong. While it's still covering hit songs, it's not hitting you over the head with cheesy high school issues. What makes this move even greater is that the majority of actors in this film already have some acting chops and have appeared in other films and TV Shows e.g. Anna Kendrick has starred in multiple films prior to this film compared to Lea Michele from Glee who was basically an unknown actress prior to the show becoming popular.The covers of popular songs in this movie are very well produced and actually makes accapella sound awesome. My personal favourite scene in the movie was the ""riff-off"" where multiple teams have to spontaneously perform a song from a randomly chosen category e.g Ladies of the 80's, Songs about sex.I don't many criticisms about this movie except for I kinda disliked some of the personality traits some of the characters portrayed at times but other than that the cast were spot-on with their roles. A big kudos to Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Skylar Austin and Adam Devine for their characters were all outstanding.if you are looking for a musical but without the epic scale of Les Miserables or the campiness of Priscilla: Queen of the Desert than look no further to Pitch Perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Lots of fun. Watched way to many times,"I have seen this film far too many times. I grew up with this movie and was always one my favourites and honestly still somewhat is today.Each performance was great and I really like the way they structured the music. What I mean by that is in a lot of musicals the singing and dancing come at strange times but this movie had designated times where the musical scenes made sense.Humour is great throughout yes you get some cringe moments here and there but for the most part the humour is on point and the actresses do a great job across the board.I liked almost all of the characters but I am not a huge fan of Audrey and it takes away from the movie a little bit for me. Movies and tv allways have one or two characters that you're not supposed to like but if it's done well the character is someone you dislike but love to watch, Audrey is just plain annoying.Anna Kendrick is a really good actress and it shows here. She has really good comedic timing and delivery. When you add that with her ability to be emotional it makes for a really good performance to compliment a really good character.The story itself I think is well done and keeps me intrigued. It's a very simple story and there isn't a lot to unpack but it gets the job done.Overall I love ""Pitch Perfect"", from beginning to end the film is packed with great performances and some quality comedy.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
This Movie Is Beneath Anna Kendrick,"Despite the fact that ""Pitch Perfect"" doesn't exactly fall into my preferred film genre, I rented it because I have thoroughly enjoyed previous flicks featuring Anna Kendrick (""Up In The Air"", ""50/50"") and figured that her presence in this one might lend it more legitimacy. Unfortunately, all it did was leave me wondering why Kendrick would lend her presence to such a clichéd, pointless film.For a basic plot summary, ""Pitch Perfect"" sees college newbie Becca (Kendrick) trying to fit in at her new campus while also pursuing a potential career as a music DJ. On some advice from her father, Becca joins a collegiate a cappella singing group in hopes of making friends and living the ""college life"".The glaring weakness of this film is that director Jason Moore should have made it a bit more of a serious effort in accordance with Kendrick's acting style. Usually, Kendrick is so cute and likable that audiences cannot help but sympathize and identify with her. In ""Pitch Perfect"", though, all the crazy proceedings around Kendrick's characters are too ridiculous to even let the audiences think they should be taking themselves seriously whatsoever.Basically, I just wonder why-oh-why did the film's producers try to follow the ""Bring It On"" cheerleading-esque approach to this movie. Rebel Wilson's ""Fat Amy"" character is about the only semblance of the film that actually made me laugh a time or two. Otherwise, it is just a collection of shock humor (vomit jokes run the course of the movie) and sight gags.The only reason I give ""Pitch Perfect"" two stars is because the musical numbers are fun and some of ""Fat Amy's"" one-liners are legitimately hilarious. However, unless you REALLY, REALLY enjoyed the ""Bring It On"" style of making a movie, you'll want to discard this one fairly quickly from your film library.",4.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Doesn't live up to the hype,"I was really excited to watch this movie, I like Anna Kendrick and everyone had amazing things to say about this. I'm not a fan of musicals at all, I always skip the singing parts in movies. But I actually liked the performances in this. I'd never buy the soundtrack but the performances didn't bore or annoy the hell out of me. The first half of the movie was way more enjoyable than the second part. Anna Camp's character was getting on my nerves, and the conflicts with the Bellas ended up going on and on and it was so obvious how it would end up, and I was just annoyed and waiting for them to get the hell over it and skip to the part where they all listen to Beca. The film is highly predictable, you can guess everything that is gonna happen 10 minutes into the movie. Because of this, I was getting impatient waiting for things that I knew would happen, to finally happen. The movie had quite a few moments, but I wouldn't watch it again. I understand why people would enjoy this movie and look pass its flaws though. It wasn't the great movie I was expecting, but I don't regret watching it either. 6/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

The plot is barely continuous in many places.The character development sucks... and it felt like the characters were trying not to say the stuff they were scripted to say. At least what you see is not what you hear.Do we really need to see a deranged Chinese chick make vomit angels? The cute head of the choir who won't compromise? The chick with the nodes on her vocal cords is blown out of proportion. Fat Amy is a bit over the top... but is one of the things that kind of works. We have the compulsory nymphomaniac (why exactly?). Also the lesbian (also why?). It sounds more like a deranged group of girls rather than a choir. Vomit scene? Once was stretching it... second time it was just cheap laughs.You squirm your way through this movie... when you should be enjoying it.

An Off-putting Mix of Cynical Mockery and Sugary Acapella,"In many respects, I got what I expected with ""Pitch Perfect"". A mash-up of a fairly standard rom-com plot with numerous song-and-dance acapella performances of pop songs and a cast of oddball characters. The ongoing competition aspect also makes it reminiscent of movies such as ""Bring It On"", which certainly has its audience. If you like these things, you might deduce from this information that you will like this movie. But what ultimately separates this film from the standard set of expectations is the heavily cynical, mocking tone and complete deficiency of genuine emotion. This movie has no heart.I underestimated the sheer irreverent goofiness and cheesiness of this movie, as well as the humor, which was surprisingly nasty, strange, mean, and raunchy throughout. Some of it was funny, but most of it was just... off. I can only assume that this was partly the result of some of the actresses, particularly Rebel Wilson, being given extraordinary leeway to improvise odd, tangential humor on the spot. The unfortunate truth of the matter is that lengthy sequences of her improvised comedy can often be boiled down to ""I'm fat and weird and disgusting, now laugh"". On the other hand, some of the odd comedic sequences were definitely scripted, which I don't understand. Is this really what people want in a movie about an all female acapella group? To be grossed out, confused, and even mildly offended? It may just be that this movie seems like the wrong place for such humor. I suppose it will either work for you or it won't.The movie is not completely beyond some level of redemption, though. The acapella performances themselves are enjoyable enough, but they usually feel so glossy and over-rehearsed so as to no longer feel authentic. Anna Kendrick herself is also a genuinely good lead for this movie and she keeps it on the rails enough for it to be tolerable, though the romance aspect of her character arc is, like the rest of this movie, excruciatingly devoid of substance. She is, however, one of the few characters to have any sort of genuine personality and not just a cynical one-dimensional cardboard cutout stereotype for the purposes of cheap mockery.If you're looking for a few cheap, awkward laughs, an empty clichéd romance subplot, and a cast of annoying characters all accompanied by some intermittent sugary sweet acapella pop song performances, ""Pitch Perfect"" is the movie for you. My only lingering question is: What is this movie supposed to be? A musical? A farce? A gross-out comedy? A cheap, cynical cash-grab for the teenage girl demographic? All of the above? I really don't know, but whatever it is, I can't say I much care for it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Embarrassing movie to sit through if your a guy...,"This isn't a awful movie but it's not a good one either. Movies where a group of students that come together to beat another team in a competition has been done before. And there are so many cliché parts in this...Just watch ""Drumline"" it's a way better movie. There are bunch of characters in this movie but a lot of them is not developed enough at all. This time around a group of students are competing in a acapella tournament. I guess this movie is for girls that are into mainstream music cause a lot of them was cracking up and laughing throughout this movie. Despite it having very corny humor that is hardly ever clever. Most of it is toilet and sexual remarks humor that isn't clever or witty. The main girl in this is Becca played by Anna Kendrick who I am not a fan of although some critics and audiences seem to really like her. She basically reminds me of a female version of Adam Scott. And like a lot of movies of this sort she is like the only normal character in this entire movie and she is surrounded by weird or awkward characters. And it depends way too much on how weird and awkward the other characters are to get in some laughs. Sometimes it can be effective but not in this case although a lot of the female audiences which made up most of the audience members was actually laughing. Nothing about this movie felt like your watch real college students at all cause the mannerism and dialogue just seemed so fake, it almost seems like a Disney drama show with more toilet and sexual humor. Also everything about this movie is predictable from start to finish and it doesn't really try to do anything different. It isn't a uber awful movie but it's far from being a good movie.

"Music Is Very Good Here, Anna Is OK< The Rest Is Definitely Not","I understand why musicals are so popular - nice actors, cool songs, great choreography, excellent soundtrack, merry atmosphere.

Especially, all those a Capella arrangements of such hits as Don't You (Forget About Me) or some more are very good, and really first-class. Yeah, Anna Kendrick is sweet, she performs very realistic, and her vocal delivery is way too great. Her dances are nice, too. But then, the rest goes. Almost all other actors are so all over the place, thrown on a kitchen sink and exaggerated that one can only eye them in utter disbelief. They overdo, overplay, overact almost everything, so the comedy quickly falls onto a farce and a mockery. The film is long, as well, it would've been better if it were shorter.

Pitch Perfect: more of the same,"Directed by Jason Moore. Starring Anna Kendrick, Brittany Snow, Rebel Wilson, Skylar Astin, Ben Platt, Anna Camp, Adam DeVine, Elizabeth Banks, John Michael Higgins. Written by Kay Cannon (screenplay) and Mickey Rapkin (book). Runtime: 112 min.If you do enjoy geeky musical comedy, choreographed pop songs, like in the TV series Glee, and predictable happy endings, you are totally invited to watch Pitch Perfect.Anna Kendrick stars as Beca, a freshman who wants to be a DJ in LA. But her dream cannot be achieved because her father – a professor in her University – forces her to give a shot to the college and all that it has to offer as well. That is why Beca joins the Bellas – an all female 'a capella' singing group.Aubrey(Anna Camp), the captain of the Bellas, doesn't understand why Beca has joined the group; that's because she wants to escape from the traditional performances and Aubrey doesn't. She thinks they can only win the International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella if they repeat the same repertory, the same clothes and the same choreography as in all their competitions.Another 'a capella' singing group at Barden University, which will compete with the girls, is the Treble Makers, an all male group from the same university as the Bellas – and their main enemy.All the boys in the group are popular, including its newer member Jesse (Skylar Astin), who will fall in love with Beca, but during the whole movie she doesn't ""realize"" she loves him as well. Actually, one of the commandments to be a Bella is not to fall in love with any Treble Maker.Besides all this melodrama, one question keeps in mind: Will the Bellas beat the Treble Makers? If you do want this answer, be prepared to see the entire Apple's products placement.In summary, the energy of the movie is its soundtrack and maybe some laughs with Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), who plays, again, the outrageous ""fat"" character.",2.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Funny but Problematic,"Great film aside from the racism (against Asians), sexism (slut shaming), and homophobia (against lesbians). Let's start with the racism - the Asian roommate almost never speaks, only has Asian friends, calls the main character ""white girl"", and is the only one (along with her friends) depicted playing video games. The Asian character that is in the ""Bellas"" speaks so softly you can't hear her, and says she ate her twin in the womb. The only possible joke here is one based on the stereotype of Asians as meek, and it is both unfunny and confusing.Next, the sexism. The film focuses on women in a largely positive light, but there are still harmful undertones lurking throughout. Women are kicked out of their troupe for having sex with members of competing troupes, but the men are not subject to the same punishment. This could just be an over the top description of reality (and fits the troupe leader's character), but when coupled with the remaining character who ""has sex a lot"" and admits it as if it is a bad thing, it seems more problematic.Finally the homophobia. Really not a fear of gays, but rather a distasteful mocking of them. The members of the troupe are constantly wondering if the character played by the black actress is a ~lesbian~ like it is some taboo subject and something to laugh at. Then, when she admits that she has a gambling problem, and later reveals she is a lesbian, the other characters seem to get some type of weird joy like ""OMG we knew she was gay the whole time!"" Literally the whole (unfunny and dragged out) joke was that this character was lesbian. Ha. Ha.The rest of the movie was pretty funny. Without these three unfunny, problematic, and hurtful lines of ""comedy"", I would probably rate it as an 8/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

MUSICAL DRAMA/ COMEDYIf ""Glee"" was made into a movie, this is probably what it would look like. It's as if there aren't any bad singers throughout this entire film. Flashy, 'a capella' singing competition between a young group of guys, and the underdogs, which consists of a group of teenage girls. Viewers know absolutely nothing about the opportunities regarding winning this competition, except for a cheap looking trophy and for bragging rights, as well the small possibility of becoming a backup singer for a famous musician. For the most part, there doesn't seem to be any money involved. The idea came from a book (I assume, from a kids book) written by Mickey Rapkin, starring Anna Kendrick as Beca who is a new student for this particular college, where a radio station is nearby to get into mixed D-Jaying. Of course, her father at first disapproves, and by chance unknowingly enters a female 'a capella' group. It's sometimes silly and pretentious as the movie displays other singing competitions, as well as singing parties which is something I've never heard before, therefore making it totally unrealistic. It's almost as if this college high school had nothing but singing in it, and that the theme almost serves as a backdrop to many familiar tunes- all sung similar to the way people sing from 'Glee' the TV show.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

"A girl named Becca joins a Capella group, The Barden Bellas, as they compete against another a Capella group from their college to win Nationals","This movie is okay but not great. There's so many little tiny things that bothered me that it overruled everything else.This movie's plot is like Glee, when there's no relationship crap to watch it's all about nationals and regionals and competitions. Things like that. That basic plot didn't bother me much. I wasn't expecting that much in that department.The actors are interesting. They're pretty good at what they got in the script.I like the performances and singing because I'm a sucker for that kind of stuff.So where should I start with the things that I disliked so much that made me mad?Let's start with the characters. The main girl Becca? A total bitch for no reason. She shuts people out and its annoying/painful to watch her interact with people. So you're already going into this movie with a character that you know is going to overcome her bitch self and I find that annoying. Onto to Jesse. A cliché. He's a nice guy and he likes Becca for no reason. She's so mean to him. Jesse is played by Skylar Astin who is incredibly hot and could do so much better than Becca. Let's go to Bumper, a jerk for no reason. We could have gotten a flashback or something to explain why he's such a jerk? Torments for no reason. I don't get it. The other girls in the Capella group seem like stereotypes: weird Asian girl, crazy girl, fat girl, black girl. Not enough development to me. I don't like the announcers for the competitions either. They're obnoxious and say incredibly stupid things. And the last person I wanted to talk about is Freddie, the guy who works at the radio station? A useless character. He's nothing but a pair of abs because there's no depth to his character. He's there to be hot.I don't like the amount of vomit in the movie. It's too much. It' s not funny. Are they trying to get guys to watch? It's unnecessary.Beca's job at the radio station is useless after her and Jesse meet. Honestly, I thought her job would conflict with her going to competitions or something. But no, nothing. It's nothing.

This is a Glee rip off, taken to college level. The campus is gorgeous, the photography and editing worked well. The musical numbers were solid.However, the cast fell completely flat for me, in spite of knowing some of their names before diving in. The characters they aim at are stereotypes, barely developed. And while that could work with a formula movie, this time it doesn't.I kept waiting to see if there was a point to making them so white bread offensive, but the pay off was weak.I kept waiting to connect with the performance of even one actress. And while likeable in real life, here they were just totally ""off.""Third is the content.I've watched R-rated content. If it's there for some purpose, that's fine. But this movie just seems to go for very sophomoric gross humor, hoping to shock.And most of the time for me, that humor flops.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Gosh, I was really bummed out at the rampant bigotry","Let's see, how many minority groups does this film make nasty jokes about? Koreans, Jews, Blacks, Lesbians, Deaf people, gays, East Indians, fat people, ... and that's just in the first 10 minutes. I was hoping to watch a funny film but this one left me feeling sick at all the hateful jokes. Am I the only one out there that had this reaction? Really bummed out that we aren't any more enlightened than the stupid 80s films that slammed anyone who wasn't white and thin. WIsh I hadn't watched this. I'm a major fan of Glee, love a Capella singing (have ""STraight No Chaser"" music CDs), and am a sucker for cheesy, over-the- top mash-ups of oldies along with choreography, so I would've loved this film if it weren't for all the hateful jokes. I think this must've been written by a bigoted old person, because do kids these days really watch the Breakfast Club and relate to any of that? Honest, I don't mind puke jokes, don't mind sex jokes, don't mind corny jokes, but racism/homophobia/making fun of disabled people is just inexcusable in my opinion. I'm middle-aged, but a teenager that I interacted with recommended this movie when she heard that I was a Glee fan. It depresses me that Hollywood churns out this stuff that makes kids think that bigotry is okay and funny.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Far From Perfect,Typical teenage flick with predictable ending.A teenager might like it but I'm no teenager so a 3 from me.,3.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
it's dragged out a bad icarly episode,"Yes, it's very difficult for me to rate the thing because I hadn't finished watching this film either, but if I voluntarily decide to watch the film during the film, I regret this decision so much that I break off the film prematurely that speaks volumes too.Every 20 minutes i left the room to do something else i don't usually do that in movies but in general it's very difficult for me to get involved the characters were too strange for me i hardly liked anyone why doesn't the protagonist do movies it's kinda weird The acapella aspect didn't bother me at all, but I still kind of missed the emotions and I also find them kind of uncomfortable to have so much sex and adult jokes here on the one hand it's child-friendly with the crowbar and on the other hand this one perverse humor i feel like i'm back in your one of the worse danschneider series.",1.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
You call yourself Fat Amy?,"Let me make one thing clear: I absolutely LOVE musicals. They bring such a wonderful, family-friendly format to the big screen that allows them to be enjoyed by everyone, and when done right, the musical pieces and the narrative can blend together to make a fantastic film. However, ""Pitch Perfect"" doesn't get there.""Pitch Perfect"" starts off with a weak narrative that doesn't develop throughout the film and almost disappears entirely towards the end. The story doesn't have any depth and only serves to set the stage for the musical pieces, an aspect of the film I thought were fantastic. Wihle that helps the music, it doesn't help the story and ultimately, you're left wondering what the purpose of the film was.However, the casting of the diverse characters and the musical numbers manage to make ""Pitch Perfect"" fun when they take center stage. The songs carve out a spot in the story and are well-justified (unlike something like High School Musical, where everyone just breaks into song and dance), and that keeps the viewer somewhat embedded in the film as there isn't much suspension of belief.If you like musicals without question, you'll definitely enjoy this film. If you're looking for a story, you won't find one. I certainly hope the sequels are better and develop the story and characters further, but maybe the point is just to watch two hours of college kids singing and dancing and not care about anything else.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
The last twenty minutes saved the whole movie,"As much as I would love to enjoy this movie, I just couldn't. I'm a big music fan but this movie just does nothing for me.First of all, it's rare that I find NONE of the characters likable. I just hate all of them twenty minutes into the movie. And at thirty minutes, I was already wondering if I should stop watching it.The racist and homophobic jokes are utterly tasteless. What was the director thinking about when producing the movie?If it wasn't for the last twenty minutes, I would've given this movie a 4/10. The plot is slow until the last twenty minutes; the major swerve at the end is nice but is not really plausible for me.I'm seeing Pitch Perfect 2 and I don't have a high hope. It's a pity, because if the plot and characters play out well, this movie could have been one of my favourites.",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"

Competitive collegiate a cappella. Is this really a thing?,"Competitive collegiate a cappella. Is this really a thing now, or is it made up for the movie? There were some solid performances here, from Anna Kendrick, Anna Camp, Brittany Snow, and Rebel Wilson. It seems like the ads for this film were all about Miss Wilson, but she is a medium character here. The singing was first-class, but you probably have to like a cappella to truly appreciate it. The plot was exceedingly formulaic. And I suppose that if you are in your teens, or maybe twenties, then teenage angst can seem important, but it is quite boring for those of us who are older. Overall, it was kind of okay, but found myself looking at my watch several times...",5.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Blah. Same old tropes.,"Blah. Nothing interesting or original here. Just same old boring tropes: unpleasant lead who hates everything, ""fatty"" girl jokes, mean girl jokes, guy basically imitating Jack Black, disgusting puke jokes, slipping and falling in puke, girl/guy love/hate relationship, hopelessly nerdy guy who (SPOILER ALERT!!!) eventually shines, underdogs who (SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!) manage to pull it all together at the last second and win. About the only interesting thing was some decent singing. Can't anyone come up with a movie on this topic that is genuinely interesting and funny? Why is it always the exact same thing?",2.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
"Hit and Miss, Give It a Try","After repeatedly watching the short advert for this movie during TV ads, I caved and rented it. Expecting an sing song version of Step Up, I thought I'd be entertained enough with possible decent dance choreography mixed with funky tracks. However, turned out to feel like a Glee rip off (I don't watch a lot of Glee). Cheesy top 10 tracks, although some I can listen to, felt tacky and weak. Bit too stereotypical for me, but hey, people seem to love it. Some love able characters, Anna Kendrick in particular and Fat Amy provides the most laughter being a new female face in comedy (Rebel Wislon). There's enough laughter and musical numbers to keep many entertained so hats off to them!",4.0,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
Fat Amy Review,"""Horizontal Running"" ""What's your name?"" ""Fat Amy."" ""You call yourself Fat Amy?"" ""Yeah, so twig bitches like you don't do it behind my back."" In Pitch Perfect, Rebel Wilson most accurately conveys the character of Fat Amy by the material and direction she was given by the director. However, much of the credit is given to Rebel Wilson as an actress. This movie was one of the most surprisingly prosperous movies, being described as ""The spirited a cappella singing in Pitch Perfect makes a predictable, feather-light coming-of-age film irresistibly fun,"" by Claudia Puig, from USA Today. How easily Fat Amy's comments were delivered, her timing, and her sheer ""fat power"" make Pitch Perfect the successful movie it is, and gives Rebel Wilson the reputation she has as an actress today.Fat Amy is so naturally comical that the jokes and one-liners that she delivers just seem to roll off of her tongue. In one scene, she approaches two of the members of the Treblemakers, the rival a cappella group, and she asks, ""What are you two turd burgers doing? Dressing for comfort?"" It is just the right amount of insult and sarcasm mixed with the courtesy of asking how they are doing, that it makes it acceptable to find it comical. Another example of her sheer, natural humor is when she is talking to one of the over-confident men from the Treblemakers, Bumper, and he says to her, ""So I have a feeling that we should kiss. Is that feeling a good feeling or an incorrect feeling?"" and Fat Amy quickly replies, ""I sometimes have a feeling I can do crystal meth, but then I think, mmm... better not."" This is one of the most quoted lines from the movie because of how natural it sounded and how easily it was delivered. She is not afraid to be brutally honest and that is what gives Fat Amy her edge, making her even more likable.Timing is of the essence when doing any type of comedy. It determines how the joke is delivered and received, and it can also alter the meaning of the joke. Fat Amy is particularly good at this aspect in her role of this movie. ""It helps that Fat Amy is played by Rebel Wilson, my favorite eccentric Aussie practitioner of lip-curled comic timing,"" is how Amy Biancolli, from the San Francisco Chronicle, describes her. In one scene, the Barden Bellas, an all girls a capella group, are revealing secrets to one another so that they can grow closer. One of the members is suspected to be a lesbian, whom Fat Amy voices her hunch about throughout the movie, and when Cynthia Rose, the suspected lesbian, is about to reveal her secret, Fat Amy says, ""We all know where this is going. Lesbihonest."" After she says that line, Cynthia Rose admits to having a serious gambling problem. Everyone from the group is surprised that that was what she admitted too, but then she says, ""It all started after I broke up with my girlfriend."" Right then, Fat Amy says, ""Whoomp, there it is."" The timing of when she delivers her line is perfect. She leaves enough time for the audience to recognize what was just revealed and react to it. If they were not delivered in the way that she does, the comical value would greatly decrease.Rebel Wilson is a larger woman and portrays her character perfectly. She is very aware of her weight and she leads with calling herself ""Fat Amy"" when she meets new people. One of the many instances that Fat Amy displays her ""fat power"" is when she is talking to the ""Deaf Jews Club"" and she says, ""Alright, I'll give you my number,"" as if they were interested in her. She does this after she is very insistent that ""Shalom"" isn't a word when the two Jewish men greet her. She has such confidence in herself, regardless of her size, that she actually plays it up and flaunts it. One of the other instances is when she is sitting in a pool with two very chiseled, good-looking men. Her swimsuit is very loud and very colorful, her sunglasses are on, and she is showing the utmost self-confidence. During an argument between the Bellas, she admits that she joined the a cappella group to get away from all of her boyfriends, who are possibly the two men from the vast amount, that are in the pool with her. This is such an unexpected quality that Fat Amy has, that it not only adds to her character, but to the movie as well.Pitch Perfect is one of the very first movies that is completely about a capella. It is one of the most surprisingly prosperous and entertaining movies that came out last year, grossing $65,001,093. Rebel Wilson as an actress, and Fat Amy's character made this movie what it is. It was the ease of the delivery of her lines, her comical timing, and her ""fat power"" that she so boldly showed that brought this to the next level of hilarity and gave the movie its social standing. Without her, this movie could have been just another mediocre comedy. Fat Amy is who made horizontal running possible.",,Anonymous,"Music, Romance"
