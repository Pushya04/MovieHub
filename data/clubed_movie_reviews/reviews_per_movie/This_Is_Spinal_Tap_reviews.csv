An enduring masterpiece.,"A classic, scathing lampoon of every successful rock band that's ever been guilty of taking themselves too seriously. Rob Reiner directs (and plays an important supporting role) but it seems like all he really needed to do was point a camera in the right direction, then edit several hours' worth of golden improvisational delight into a concise, intelligible ninety-minute package. It's a roaring parade of nonstop laughs, some blunt and easy, others sharp and witty. Famous bits like Christopher Guest's ""this one goes to eleven"" have been played to death but still elicit smiles, while deeper cuts, such as the band's reaction to contemporary critics or their infamous Stonehenge performance, land as if they were brand new. And the music is great, too, not just as a cutting satire, but as a convincing love letter to the days when power rock was all the rage and flocks of buzzed, well-feathered teens would still pack a stadium to hear the loudest noise on the planet.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Cult classic,"By many seen as the favorite cult classic (together with 'The Rocky Horror Picture Show') 'This is Spinal Tap' is truly a comedy masterpiece. The rockumentary about fake band Spinal Tap seems so honest and serious that the slightest joke gets a huge laugh. We follow the band together with a documentary filmmaker, played by director Rob Reiner, on a tour that must make sure they will have a comeback. We see some of their shows where things go wrong, we see how they argue about the cover of their album, and we see how a girlfriend almost destroys the band.The movie handles all these events as serious as possible, presenting itself as a real documentary about a real band. The fact that the band members are not too bright makes it funny. Especially the scene where the lead singer talks about an amplifier that goes to eleven instead of ten and therefore produces louder sounds is hilarious. The scene where the band plays on a Stonehenge stage is a classic, very memorable.Writer Christopher Guest recently wrote and starred in 'Best in Show' (2000) and 'A Mighty Wind' (2003), two hilarious and terrific fake documentaries, the so-called mockumentaries, but 'This is Spinal Tap' stays the classic example. He and his co-writers, including director Reiner, have created the ultimate cult classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Smell the Glove!,"The humor of ""This is Spinal Tap"" has a special time-release formula.  I didn't find myself rolling on the floor laughing the first time I saw this but as the day went on my friends and I couldn't stop recalling the dialogue.  This movie is a legend.""See Spinal Tap"" should be written in the dictionary next to satire. Lately satire has come to mean a simple mockery of pop-culture instead of ""human vice or folly attacked through irony, derision or wit"".  Movies like ""Scary Movie"" claim to be parodies or satire without even trying to be witty.  They just imitate something as opposed to commenting on it.  True satire takes a bit more work by the writers and will make you laugh much harder.Spinal Tap gives you the absurdity of the rock and roll world, yet still respects the music.  I understood this when I saw a clip of the movie for the first time at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  It was the scene with amps that go to ""11"".  I couldn't stop thinking about that scene until I finally saw the movie.  Every aspect of the music world is lampooned; arrogance, absurdity, backstage crybabies, has-beenism, volume, even the Beatles.  This movie is quoted like the Simpsons, which isn't always good but certainly proof of legendary movie.  It's dry, deadpan humor and it may take a day to sink in but this movie is hilarious.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Still the funniest rock'n'roll movie ever, and one of the best DVDs on the market.","'This Is Spinal Tap' has been part of my life for so many years that it's hard to remember a time when I hadn't seen it. Having recently bought it on DVD and rewatched it for the nth time I was once again struck and just how clever and amusing this movie is. Christopher Guest and friends are not only very talented comedians with an amazing ability to improvise, but they know their music, and this is the real strength of the movie. Even though I have almost memorized every scene and joke it's STILL funny to me no matter how many times I watch it. Not only is the movie itself a classic, but the DVD is one of the best buys around with plenty of extras, deleted scenes, many as good as those chosen, and best of all a hilarious commentary by Tufnel, St Hubbins and Smalls which is even funnier than the movie itself. In fact it's the most entertaining DVD commentary track I've heard to date. This movie is a comedy classic, and easily the sharpest rock'n'roll parody ever made. If you haven't seen it before you're in for a treat! Absolutely essential viewing for all rock'n'roll fans, metal or otherwise!",,Anonymous,Music
Deserves its fame,"Spinal Tap has been called one of the funniest movies ever made by many people over the years. I had always been familiar with it. I was very familiar with almost 70% of the scenes: the amplifier that goes to 11, the Stonehenge dance, the inability to find the way onstage in Cleveland. Plus, when it was first released on VHS, I had rented and loved Fear of a Black Hat, a mockumentary about a rap group which more or less rips off every scene of This Is Spinal Tap. After finally sitting down with This Is Spinal Tap, I am still a fan of Fear of a Black Hat (and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't heard of it), but it can not come close to touching the genius of the collective vision of Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest, Micheal McKean and Harry Shearer. I laughed pretty much constantly, and belly laughs, all through the film. It does kind of slow down nearer the end with the bands falling apart (i.e., the plot gets in the way of the documentary), but there was never a scene in the film that didn't have something hilarious. I have to give this film 10/10. This Is Spinal Tarp, er, um, I mean Tap is one of the funniest comedies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Tap: It's The Gift That Keeps On Giving,"When it comes to the glorious stupidity of rock 'n' roll music, the whip-smart mockumentary gold standard ""This Is Spinal Tap"" has no peers. Sidesplitting on an epic scale, this is also a shortlist candidate for Greatest Comedy Ever, and can claim parentage of every self-aware music film made since, from the wildly inventive ""24 Hour Party People (2002),"" to recent Tap-evocative record label satire ""Stadium Anthems (2018).""""Tap"" now transcends its early filmic and rock confines: Nigel Tufnel, David St. Hubbins, and Derek Smalls have burrowed deep into the cultural zeitgeist, holding sway in the very words we choose in conversations at the pub and by the water cooler (see: ""goes to eleven""). And its commentary on the fleeting absurdities of fame have never been more relevant.Almost forty years old and still swallowing everything in its path, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is as enduring as it is the hilarious, and that's quite a feat. This is one of the most joyously experienced entertainment vehicles ever assembled. - (Was this review of use to you? If so, let me know by clicking ""Helpful."" Cheers!) - WATCHED IT?

Must Have Been Hard To Keep A Straight Face,"Overall, this was a pretty good farce about a washed-up English rock group. It's played as a mockumentary, (a fake documentary) with director Rob Reiner playing the role of the interviewer of the band. If it wasn't a movie in which you can retake scenes, I am sure we would have seen him laugh a number of the ""serious"" questions he asked this stupid band. I would think it would hard not to laugh in a number of places, because he plays a very serious interviewer. I'm sure he did many times.There are funny moments in here. The only part I really didn't like was near the end when the bickering of the band got out of control. Their constant arguing gets tough to take after awhile. That's another problem here; there are no appealing characters. This British band is not comprised of nice guys, and I also found their accents tough to understand. If this is out on DVD with English subtitles, it might be worth a second look.The music was fair, nothing to rave about. Overall, I enjoyed the movie but didn't find it anywhere as great as most critics described it. It's okay, but not that funny.One of the writers, Christopher Guest, has gone on to make several ""mockumentaries."" He has done quite well with that genre, better than Reiner. I've seen them all, and Guest's comedies are all entertaining to various degrees.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
On the fine line between stupid and clever... kind of like lukewarm water,"Not too long ago, my classmates and I were allowed to bring in a DVD of our choice as it was nearing the end of the school term. Knowing that these pop culturists wouldn't be too happy to watch one of my 'arty cult films', I didn't give a shite and brought in 'This is Spinal Tap'. They quite happily agreed to put it on after I told them it was funny and had swearing in it. But soon, boredom started to sink in with the class. ""Crap"", they labelled it. ""Boring"", they yelled. After less than ten minutes, my teacher was changing the disk to, wait for itÂ… 'The Others'. One of my chums, being a fan of the film, dismissed them as idiots. However, I told him it was all a matter of taste and that they would be much happier settling down to watch their 40-year-old virgins and American pies than this more subtly-coloured tin of paint. So as I walked over to the front of the classroom, tail between my legs, to pick up my DVD my teacher leaned over and said, ""Don't worry, I liked it. You have to be cultured to enjoy this sort of thing."" And you know what, she's right.To be quite frank, 'Spinal Tap' is just like marmite. You'll either love everything about it or hate every frame of it. Some people say it's like watching wet paint dry, others say it was so funny it gave them a hernia. I definitely fall into that latter category. After the umpteenth viewing, I still find it painfully hilarious!But that's not the only reason for seeing it. It's also a totally accurate, observational and witty deconstruction of rock's strutting pretensions. If you're someone who thinks rock bands take themselves far too seriously, you need this movie. If, on the other hand, you feel like rock stars should forever be treated like gods and worshipped on a regular basis, you might just want to avoid this. After all, when Aerosmith's Steven Tyler had finished watching it he said he just felt like he wanted to throw himself off a cliff! It reveals the utter shallowness of rock 'n' roll without even flinching!If you're also a lover of in-your-face laugh-out-loud got-it-straight-away humour, just stay away. Far, far away. This is intellectual stuff. You have to possess intelligence to enjoy it. I've never met any stupid people who did enjoy this film.Director Rob Reiner really shows how broad his range is with this (his best in my opinion!), bringing every authentic detail, no matter how seemingly minor, to the screen effortlessly with a wonderfully sharp cast. Its still a challenge to get my head around the fact that this is from the same tubby Santa Claus look-alike who made 'The Princess Bride' and 'Stand By Me'! Reiner has always been a man with extraordinarily wide horizons and always will be, constantly entertaining cinema-goers with so many different stories!The film's fly-on-the-wall mockumentary style works wonders, getting some beautiful performances from its actors (namely Michael McKean and Christopher Guest) and adding to its 'natural' feel. Many films, mainly British ones, have imitated this style ever since. Even one of the film's actors and co-writers has stuck to the hip of this film for the most part of his career, coming up with new and even more outlandish 'mockumentaries' to entertain and sate his legion of followers.On each viewing, you'll erupt into laughter at the discovery of a new joke. Then for weeks on end, you'll be quoting it to your friends and everyone you know. It's like a treasure trove without a bottom!To finish this not-so-critical analysis, I can never find any fault or flaw even after the innumerable viewings I've had. I never get bored of it either. I think the reason I like this so much is, honestly, because it was made for people like me!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The only rockumentary you ever need to see,"I will never be able to see another rockumentary again without laughing myself sick.  This movie hits its target dead on.  I don't know how the actors kept a straight face through reciting their lines.  The scene where Rob Reiner is discussing the rock critics analysis of their albums is the funniest scene I can remember in any movie.  I mean ""s*** sandwich"" that made me laugh for 10 minutes straight.  I wonder how long it will take to get that Hell Hole song out of my brain!",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Legends of Rock n' Roll,"As This Is Spinal Tap came out in 1984 I'd like to think that the guys are doing those nostalgia type tours along the lines of Herman's Hermits and Bobby Rydell. They're not quite at the stage of the nostalgia tours, in fact this Mockumentary makes it clear that these guys have not seen that their time has come and gone.A tiny select few musical performers cross generations with their appeal and these guys aren't it. Rob Reiner directs and plays a documentary film maker who accompanies the band Spinal Tap on its latest American tour where all kinds of things go wrong. Some familiar people make cameo appearances. I kind of like Patrick MacNee as their record label president and Bruno Kirby as a limousine driver who has a more realistic insight than the musicians.This Is Spinal Tap has a lot of devoted fans. I'm not one of them though I recognize the importance of the film as a prototype of a new genre. Mockumentaries are an acquired taste and if that's the taste you've acquired than this is your film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
THIS...IS...OVERRATED!!!,"This is yet another movie regarded as one of the funniest comedies in the AFI Hall of Fame that doesn't even deserve to be a runner-up.  Who are the members of the AFI?  I'd like to have a word with them.  This pseudo-documentary/pseudo-comedy starts out with a few funny gags, scattered here and there.  But in the second and third acts, when the band goes downhill, the comedy becomes as soggy as a wet rag.  The gags are so slight and cheap.  We're stuck with bland gags, like the one about the tiny sandwiches in the dressing room.  Wow, is that a classic moment or what!!! Just one bland gag after another.  Even though the running time was a mere 83 minutes, I found it tedious and lagging.  This is one of those comedies I have to watch with someone to actually find which moments are supposed to be funny.  I probably still won't get a laugh, but at least I'll have more of an understanding.  Is this film true to the world of rock and roll, and does it have a satirical bite?  I don't know.  Maybe.  Whatever it was, it sure as hell wasn't interesting.  I don't know much about rock and roll, as far the behind-the-scenes stuff goes, but I don't care what happens off-stage if it's going to be this boring.  If you want to see a good film about rock and roll, see ""Almost Famous.""  Better yet, if you want to see a much better mockumentary about the music business--see ""Fear of a Black Hat.""  A much more scatological comedy, but a much smarter and entertaining one as well.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Laughs at '11'; one of the greatest comedies ever filmed!,"THIS IS SPINAL TAP (1984) **** Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer (Cameos: Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, Fran Drescher, Paul Shaffer, Howard Hesseman, Ed Begley, Jr., Fred Willard, Angelica Huston {note spelling!} ).Hysterically funny and dead-on ""rockumentary"" spoof of absurd documentaries and lame so-called rock groups with wicked satirical approach and clever camera shots as well. Directed by Reiner (his debut) with accurate depiction of super-inflated egos, pompous hangers-on and hilarious intimate moments with great dialogue thanks to the improvisations of the trio who reportedly worked from no screenplay. Best moment: Spinal Tap trying to find the stage. And I personally agree with the keyboardist's philosophy of ""Have a good time, all the time"".",,Anonymous,Music
Hello Cleaveland!  Still one of the funniest films ever and even better on DVD,"Spinal Tap seemed funny the first time I saw it, but I never got all the jokes.  Now though, I saw it through and through and I loved it even more (especially on DVD where the extras are hilarious).  Nearly every gag in the movie is dead pan funny, from the cover of ""Smell the Glove"" (just the description will make you laugh) to all the others including the three piece guitar solo, the animal costumes (""this is what you'll look like as a crab"" is the funniest line of the 80's next to ""Frank, they're not here for you, Weird Al is on the plane"" in Naked Gun), the backstage food, (of course) the amp that goes to 11 and the 18 inch stonehenge.  Satire at one of it's best, and it's excellent.  Cameos include Bruno Kirby, Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, Paul Schaffer and Anjelica Houston.  Other best line: you can not do free flow jazz odyssey in front of a festival crowd!  A+",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of funniest movies ever!!.,"I absolutely adore this movie, is unbelievably funny and realistic in so many ways in regards to the life of a rock star.

Rockumentary is a mockumentary,"This is FANTASTIC! Writers Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer in collaboration with director Rob Reiner have created a satire so dead-on its target that it might be scary if it wasn't so hilarious.Filmmaker Marty DiBergi, taking a break from dog food commercials, is determined to capture the sights, sounds and smells of his favorite rock group, the legendary Spinal Tap, on their latest U.S. tour. They're a 20-year old heavy metal outfit from England centering around lead singer David St. Hubbins (McKean), lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Guest) and bass guitarist Derek Smalls (Shearer).  The rest of the band is a revolving door of personnel including a series of unlucky drummers who have met with bizarre demises. The new tour is the first the band has made of America in years, and unfortunately the they seem to have lost about as many fans as they've lost brain cells. When asked if the smaller venues that the band is playing on this tour means they are losing popularity, manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra) quickly dismisses the idea. The band's fans are just becoming more ""selective,"" he says.Still, the group is received well at their initial shows--that is if the gig hasn't been canceled, if their balky stage props don't malfunction, and if the band can find its way to the stage from their dressing rooms. But the tour is one disaster following another. Fans don't show up for autograph sessions at record stores. Radio stations play their oldies and ask, ""where are they now?"" To top things off, David's girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick), the band's Yoko Ono, arrives. She soon starts contributing her ideas, such as having the band dress in fantasy creature costumes and recording their music ""in Dubly.""Even with all this trouble, the band feels things will pick up if they can just get their new album released. But Polymer Records refuses to distribute ""Smell the Glove"" with its lurid cover art. Eventually it's released with a solid black record sleeve, with nary a word or picture on it. This turns out to be a reverse image of the Beatles' white album in appearance, artistic success and sales. The band sinks so low as to be billed second to a puppet show at a theme park. The pressures are just too much and as the tour limps to a close the long life of Spinal Tap seems at an end. But rock & roll is a funny business...Throughout we're treated to the band's rock & roll wisdom and philosophy. For instance, Nigel lets Marty in on one of the reasons for their success--loud amplifiers. While the volume settings on other bands' equipment might just go to 10, theirs goes to 11! Asked if there's really a difference, Nigel replies, ""Yeah, well it's like... one louder, innit?""There are tons of cameos by all sorts of people, including some funny portrayals of PR flacks by Fran Drescher and Paul Shaffer. This is a brilliant comedy that, despite all the parody, loves its subject. Treat yourself to it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

But I also disliked Walk Hard, so maybe the fake music doc genre isn't for me. I do like Christopher Guest and could see some of his Corky character from Waiting for Guffman in here. It's fun to see Billy Crystal and Fran Drescher in small roles. So overall it was just okay.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Overrated,"Rob Reiner's ""This is Spinal Tap"" is perhaps one of the most overrated films I've seen. Despite the talent of Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, and the apperances of many actors who would appear in the great mockumentaries directed by Guest (""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"", and ""A Mighty Wind""), this film is a bore most of the way through. Certain moments are of interest, such as when the rock group played by the three actors can't find their way to the stage and when one of the members is showing a stereo with 11 being the highest number. But this mockumentary is horrible when compared to the mockumentaries Christopher Guest would later make. The reason why this film to me is a failure is very simple: Rob Reiner. I haven't seen a film of his yet, where he doesn't sell out to Hollywood. Guest doesn't sell out and his film, and remains at top to the end. I really think this film could have been better if it would have been a Guest-directed film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Cult-status? What? Why?,"Hack documentarian DiBergi (played by director Rob Reiner himself) follows 1980s glitter rock band 'Spinal Tap' behind the stage as they are launched into a Unites States tour.I've had numerous friends recommend me This is Spinal Tap and, judging by the style of it, I thought for sure I would find this very funny. I finally sat down to watch it, and I kept waiting for a funny moment to arrive. A line, an image, a gag -- anything. The best I could do was smile half-assedly at some of the scenes and only because I so desperately wanted to find it amusing. Spinal Tap seems to shift to automatic pilot very soon in the film and just expect its audience to find the bland band interactions hysterical, as it attempts nothing else. The dialogue is viciously realistic as is the format in which the film is shot, but does that make it funny? No, not really - it only makes it realistic.The cast are not very dynamic. They are, at best, mildly funny in a goofy sort of way that you just chuckle on the inside at, but ultimately every last one of them is incapable of projecting any real charisma or humour on-screen. It is therefore beyond me how This is Spinal Tap ever got vaulted into a cult status.As for good aspects, it does have some interesting approaches to it, like the mockumentary style which it adopts. I'm sure there was comedy behind it, but these ideas were either badly executed or not at all. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A hilarious little spoof - wit rather than clumsy stuff,"In 1982 the world's loudest band is about to undertake it's comeback tour of America to coincide with the release of the new album.  The group, Spinal Tap, is accompanied by documentary filmmaker Marti DeBergi on what turns out to be a fateful chapter in the band's colourful history.Despite what anyone else tells you, this is easily one of the most quotable movies made and is just as funny today as it was when it was made, unless you are so out of touch with the world that it affectionately spoofs.  The film is almost a tragedy so well does it chronicle the absurd collapse of the band.  However, regardless of the hows and whats, the comedy is in the characters and the sharp dialogue.  While most of the specific action is really funny, it is best during the backstage arguments and the candid interviews.The dialogue is fantastic from start to finish and is made better by a superb cast delivering absurd lines with a straight face!  McKean, Guest and Shearer are the strongest of the cast have most of the best lines.  The support cast is also crammed with cameos from such people as Bruno Kirby, Billy Crystal, Begley Jnr, Macnee, Paul Shaffer, Anjelica Huston and others. Reiner excels as director, writer and documentarian, the film has his hands all over it.Overall this is a great film, so much has been said about it that I won't go on any longer.  While it is not an out and out spoof like Naked Gun, this film is wittier as the comedy comes from the dialogue and the sheer imagination of the writing!",,Anonymous,Music
Should be on the Top 100 of all time,"I have seen this movie more times than any other movie ever. When I was 12 or 13, my brother rented it and we watched it 3 times in the same day. At first, I hated it because I didn't know any better, and my brother never ""helped"" me figure out why it was funny. The second time I watched it, I ""got it"" and have never been the same person ever since.First off, the entire film is ad-libbed except for the songs and a few lines; which is the reason that people are talking over each other a lot, requiring repeated viewings to catch everything. It is in documentary format, so it all works for this type of film. The songs are hysterical but catchy at the same time, just like real 80's arena rock and hair metal (well some of it). It certainly helps to be a fan of the rock genre to enjoy the film, or you will miss out on some significant references and the basis for each of the band members.There are no dull moments in this brisk, 82-minute film, and the sheer number of hysterical cameos (including Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Howard Hesseman, Paul Shaffer and Anjelica Huston) kicks the film up to 11 as they all put in stellar performances.This film should be in the Top 100, no question. On my list, it would be in the Top 10. Of course, American History X is currently rated #41, so that tells you something about the IMDb rating system.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I Wish I Could Give it an Eleven,"Having watch all those vapid rock documentaries over the years, I've absorbed the style that appears. The great strength of this is that it is always understated. Spinal Tap is going on a reunion concert and is being followed by cameras. First of all, the concert scenes are wonderful, out of an era. They are often clueless about the world they inhabit. There are so many hilarious bits I can't enumerate. For example, the complaining about the sandwich meat and the size of the bread in their dressing room. The discussion of the album cover. On and on. It is the marvelous Christopher Guest troupe and the do the whole thing proud. I'm glad I saw it again after 35 years.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not as funny as I thought it would be...,"I was expecting this movie to be a bit more humorous than it turned out. I guess there were a few laugh-out-loud moments like the 'stonehenge' bit and the 'bizarre gardening accident' comments, but for the most part I just found the characters to be portrayed as too visibly stupid to be of any enjoyment. Christopher Guest's character making dumb comments isn't that funny to me.Overall, I just found the nature of the movie to be too obvious of a mockery, if you know what I mean. It's even cut and edited in a way that doesn't feel natural as a documentary would. Maybe my personal enjoyment was affected because I've seen too many rockumentaries already, like 'Hail Hail Rock n Roll', 'Woodstock', 'Gimme Shelter' and 'Stop Making Sense', and most of the jokes and tropes just didn't seem all that witty or fresh when you can see all of the drama/backstage fighting for real by watching an actual doc.Oh well, maybe this is a reflection on how films with cult followings can be misleading, and the original responses are more accurate.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Insanely funny and clever, even better on repeat viewings","It might even be better to watch this film with closed captions because the lyrics to the songs are just hilarious and brilliant.If you've never been in a band you may not get all the nuances. But even if you aren't, it's a very funny parody mock ""documentary"" of a fictional English classic rock band from the 60s that thinks it can bring the same raw image and message of sexuality to a more 'mature' 80s. And they are, musically and lyrically, passe for the new generation. But these artists, who take themselves very seriously, come apart as time moves on leading to tension between the band members in a tragically funny story line.What probably made this so terrific is that it was the first, an experiment by which numerous others (including themselves) have tried to reproduce - making a fake documentary about a real subject. And with some topics, especially artists and even moreso hard rock musicians, it's primed for satire. Remarkably, the actors are all skilled musicians and the music is fun, more than listenable and the lyrics are brilliant and clever.If you notice, this is the only movie rated out of 11. And there is a reason for that, ROFLMAO. A great trend setter that I think most can enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Good laughs for music lover and insiders.,"Mockumentry about an ageing British rock band returning to play a series of gigs in the USA.One of these movies that never set the world on fire upon its release - how many people saw it in a cinema? - but through video and TV has become a cult and maybe even a classic.It represents a lot of little gags about tastelessness, musicians on-the-road and people in forced marriages, but most of all it  takes the rip out of heavy metal and all those ""has anyone seen my socks"" on-the-road documentaries; although it is alleged (by director Rob Reiner) that some people don't realise that this is a joke!There is no need to do any market research about humour. Either you laugh or you don't.  The amps that go up to ""11"" is  my favourite. You have to watch it twice to catch some of the dialogue (worth checking out on this site) and see how the running gags sit together.(The fate of the various drummers is a gem.)The music itself is actually not that much better or worse than real B league rock and the only real spark of musical  inspiration is the ""flashback"" to Spinal Tap in the sixties. The central theme is ""tastelessness"" in words and music; although this is hardly new or original.Yes, this film is funny and memorable - with one or two gems - but the thing that you are left with is a lot of mini sketches, stretched around a framework of familiarity. The theme of  musicians being narcissistic, egotistic, tasteless and dim has all been done before, just not as well or with the correct budget.The final thought is how music and comedy are alike. Both can be enjoyable and make the world a better place, but you rarely learn anything or gain anything.

11 out of 10 stars,"I think it's safe to say that if it wasn't for This is Spinal Tap, the genre of comedy in both film and television would be very different today.It's well known at this point that This is Spinal Tap was not the first mockumentary film. Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run for example is often mentioned as being one of the earliest films to use the format back in 1969, and later on Albert Brooks would make his own mockumentary film Real Life in 1979.This is Spinal Tap wasn't even the first rock mockumentary. The great Eric Idle of Monty Python made a made for tv film titled The Rutles: All You Need is Cash which is an incredibly funny movie that parodies the career of The Beatles. But I don't care who did it first, I care who did it best and I think it's pretty undeniable that in the filmmaking style of the mockumentary, This is Spinal Tap reigns as the all-time greatest. It is The Godfather of mockumentaries and it is by far the one that made the biggest impact.At the time of its release, the film was seen by many people as a real rock documentary, which in hindsight makes the movie just that much funnier. Prominent rock musicians such as Robert Plant, Ozzy Osbourne, Dee Snider, and Glenn Danzig have all gone on to praise the film for its legitimate accuracy in portraying the rock n roll lifestyle. This is Spinal Tap is also easily one of the most quotable movies of all time. The term ""Turn it up to 11"" has been permanently cemented as being part of the rock n roll/heavy metal lexicon.In my eyes, This is Spinal Tap is a perfect comedy. It makes me laugh out loud every single time I watch it. All of the performances are hilariously genuine and perfectly executed. The fact that the vast majority of the film was completely improvised really shows how incredibly talented the cast was, and the music by the band is legitimately fun and catchy.

"Comedy not quite at an ""11""","I honestly had no idea of what to expect with THIS IS SPINAL TAP, with the exception of a couple of bits that have entered the pop culture lexicon (the Marshall amp bit, for instance). What I got was...OK, I guess? It wasn't exactly a laugh-riot, but there were a number of recurring funny bits. Still, there were too many stretches that I didn't find funny at all. Fortunately, the songs were well-written and performed. Otherwise, I would have been mostly bored. Overall, it was a mixed bag in terms of comedy, although it did have a few amusing insights into the over-the-top-ness of rock bands.

If you are expecting funny lines every thirty seconds then I suggest to stick to watching crud like 'Friends' or similar US sitcoms, UK not much better these days.I could name the celebs that the characters in this film remind me of but I would probably hear from their lawyers.

One word: Classic!,"Of the five or so movies of Rob Reiner's I have seen so far, all of them have ranged from very good to outstanding. This is Spinal Tap fits in the outstanding category, as it works simply brilliantly as a spoof and is one of the unsurpassed best of the genre. I love the mockumentary style in which it is filmed, and the production number is absolutely brilliant. The dialogue is absolutely hilarious, while there is real pleasure in the details especially in the intentionally crass lyrics.Rob Reiner's direction never hits a false note, while the performances of Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer are note-perfect, while Bruno Kirby, Anjelica Huston, Billy Crystal and Ed Begley Jnr support them brilliantly. All in all, brilliantly done and a must see. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Metal is NOT a fad.,"A 'mockumentary' that affectionately spoofs the heavy rock genre, This Is Spinal Tap follows the titular group on a disastrous US tour to coincide with the release of Smell The Glove, their first album in six years.Director Rob Reiner's film is a firm favourite amongst metal-heads, despite mocking the music scene they love so much. This is because metal fans, myself included (a proud headbanger since the mid '80s), can acknowledge the often over-the-top theatricality and absurdity of their chosen genre, and have the intelligence to laugh along with it.And Spinal Tap is full of laughs: from Nigel the lead guitarist (Christopher Guest) proudly stating that his amp goes up to eleven, to the miniature stonehenge stage prop, to the band playing second on the bill after a puppet show, the film is full of great gags, with much of the dialogue being improvised to add to the authenticity of the documentary format.And to make things even better, the music is very good too: I have the Spinal Tap album on vinyl and it is packed with great tunes, from the early '60s songs 'Cups and Cakes' and 'Gimme Some Money', to their hippy hit '(Listen to The) Flower People', through to their heavy rock anthems 'Hell Hole', 'Sex Farm', 'Big Bottom' and, of course, the mighty 'Stonehenge', where the little children danced beneath the haunted moon10/10, although I would go up to 11 if IMDb allowed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This is a great film because of what it ushered in as opposed to its actual content...,"I am a huge fan of the improvised mockumentaries and whatever you think of ""This is Spinal Tap"", you must acknowledge that it laid the groundwork for future projects with many of these same people. In other words, if it hadn't been for ""Spinal Tap"", you never would have had ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"" or ""A Mighty Wind""....or even mockumentaries done by entirely different casts, such as ""And God Spoke"".Oddly, however, I must say that although this was a seminal film, I am not a huge fan of it. I am not saying it's a bad film--it's just that their later projects were stronger (though I must acknowledge that they never gained cult status like ""Spinal Tap""). One of the biggest reasons is that I think that they honed their improvisational skills with subsequent projects (aside from ""For Your Consideration""--a film that simply stank). Less of the jokes fell flat in these later films--and many in ""Spinal Tap"" did. It's well worth seeing...but I think that with its huge reputation I was expecting a bit too much.

Excess all areas,"The IMDb Key Plot-words says it all really...how many movies can you think of which list ""cucumber"" as one of its key words? In case you haven't seen it by the way, afore-mentioned cucumber is the culmination of only one of several hilarious sight gags in this priceless send-up of the early 80's rock industry. It's almost as much fun trying to work out just which naff bands from that era Spinal Tap are based on...me, I can obviously see references to Black Sabbath (complete with Sharon Osbourne-type interfering wife-cum-manager!) and veteran UK boogie-merchants Status Quo with their psychedelic beginnings and twin-guitarist, intellectually-challenged duo of Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt, heck they seem to almost prophesy Van Halen and they got to the Black Album years before Metallica! Everybody plays it dead straight which garners maximum comic effect and the set-piece gags are brilliantly set up and deliver big laughs every time. Favourite scenes...? Too many to count but how about the band getting lost on the way to the stage of a dingy Stateside university, harmonising at Graceland, the finger-sandwich scene, the miniature Stonehenge backdrop, replete with to-scale dancing druid-dwarfs, not forgetting the pod-busting sequence. The ridiculously over-the-top sexist lyrics to the Iron Maiden riffed songs will also crack you up. I've actually no time at all for the heavy-metal genre of music, especially its early 80's spandex era so scathingly targeted here (Whitesnake anyone?) and sometimes wonder if true HM fans are in on the joke even as they laugh along with the rest of us...

"no classic, but a fine send-up nonetheless...","""This is Spinal Tap"" is the granddaddy of the 'mockumentary' subgenre (consisting of an admittedly small group of films), and like an elder, it has aged in ways both positive and negative. The script, by Christopher Guest (""Waiting for Guffman""; ""Best in Show""), Michael McKean, Harry Shearer (""The Simpsons""), and Rob Reiner (who also directed) shows an astute knowledge of the behind-the-scenes world of rock music whilst amplifying the excesses of the lifestyle with satiric gusto. The film is awash in early-80s glamour, neon, cheesy yet catchy musical interludes, and ostentatious Van Halen hairdos. Clocking in at 83 minutes, ""Spinal Tap"" breezes by quickly enough, but the gags often feel too spaced-out and too subtle for their own good...while this helps the ersatz-documentary aspect, the comedy suffers a little. Despite this, ""Spinal Tap"" is a highly entertaining item with some wickedly funny scenes (the dwarfs dancing around a miniature mock-up of Stonehenge is priceless), and remains relevant today as a tongue-in-cheek portrait of the excesses of the music world.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the most touching love stories of the 1980s.,"'Spinal Tap' is a bit like 'Life of Brian'.  It is one of those films you watched a thousand times as a kid, re-enacting scenes and quoting one-liners with friends as if they expressed the meaning of life (they do).  It is impossible to be objective about, or even enjoy it as a film - it is recognition, not surprise, that now comprises the pleasure.Even so, the film slots in neatly with Reiner's future romantic comedies, and the relationship between Nigel and David is immensely touching, as they have to battle the usual obstcles to their love before realising that they are worthless without each other.  Watch how David celebrates the juvenile misogyny of 'Big Bottoms' by thrusting his priapic axe against Nigel's titular rump.  Every farcical set-piece, song, line of dialogue, facial expression, incident is a classic.  So Rob, what happened?",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Interesting, remarkable for the subgenre to which it belongs, credible... but I didn't find it funny.","I'm not a specific admirer of mockumentaries, but I recognize their value if they're funny. The film shows the tour of a British rock band called Spinal Tap, and the enormous difficulties and crazy things they carry out, on and off the stage. It's supposed to be a comedy... but, to be honest, it didn't make me laugh.I recognize the value that this film had for the cinematographic subgenre it launched, and the interest that it has for cinema students and others who deepen their knowledge of the seventh art in greater detail. For me, as I'm just a guy who watches films because he likes them, it's different: it's harder to convince me to watch this a second time with arguments based on the many technical good aspects. Being a comedy, it has to be funny. If it doesn't, it failed as a comedy (even considering the fact that I may not be the target audience, that would just be a sign that it's not a film for me).Although it didn't make me laugh, I recognize that Rob Reiner does an interesting job and manages to give his film enormous authenticity on all levels. I wonder what fieldwork he did to prepare for the project, whether he spoke to journalists who follow the music industry, with bands or music artists, because in fact the film captures quite well the bizarre things that can happen on a rock tour. And the work of the main actors (Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, Christopher Guest) is equally worthy if we consider that much of what they say is improvised at that moment, not previously written. The film looks cheap and this is perhaps even intentional: the cinematography resembles a ""found-footage"" film, with the image shaky, poorly calibrated, full of grain at times. The sets are very good and the soundtrack, made for the film, is absolutely believable.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
About as Funny as Death of a Salesman,"Here is the story of the members of a rock band who, because of their stupidity and wilful blindness, together with the lies and deception imposed on them by their manager, refuse to listen to record companies who don't back them up, critics who pan them, radio stations that won't play their music, promoters who cancel their gigs and fans who don't care any more. Over the course of the movie, their illusions are slowly and painfully stripped away, as they come face-to-face with themselves as has-beens and failures.  It's the same story as Death of a Salesman.  And about as funny.Rob Reiner has cleverly imitated the style of a documentary film, and the actors are all so extremely plausible in these roles that it comes as no surprise that many people watch this film without realizing that it is fiction or have become fans of a nonexistent group.  Read the other reviews if you don't believe this.  People regularly have to be told that this film is a joke, which means usually that it's not a very good joke.As a satire, this film also falls short.  If this imaginary group is held up to ridicule, Reiner has carefully insulated the entire music industry from that ridicule.  If Spinal Tap is ridiculous, the fact that everyone seems to reject them implies that the music industry is too savvy to be that ridiculous.  Satire that doesn't poke fun at real people isn't satire.There are occasional flashes of genuine brilliance, such as the amp that ""goes to 11"".  Unfortunately the film shies away from the absurdity of such concepts rather than exploiting them.  Having stated the concept it is then dismissed as something only Nigel Tufnel would be stupid enough to to think.Mostly, however, the film relies upon its uncanny resemblance to a real rockumentary to entertain.  There is no question that a really effective imitation can be very entertaining.  Ask anyone who has seen an Elvis impersonator.  Aficionados of the heavy metal genre will recognize a number of allusions to real musicians here, but such allusions will be lost on less well-informed viewers.You might think that the film might be an effective parody or caricature. But the illusion is too close to the reality--parody and caricature get their humour from grossly emphasizing some aspect of the thing imitated, like making Mick Jagger's lips the size of a football.  There is none of that here.In short, there is not sufficient humour to counterweigh the essentially tragic nature of the story presented.  There is, as you might say, a very fine line between tragedy and comedy.Watch it for the cleverness and the truly fine acting throughout, but not for laughs unless you like laughing at cripples.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
This is ... it?,"A subtly funny and intimate little movie. However, having been told about how good this movie was until my ears dropped off, having seen it referenced on innumerable occasions, and having watched the Spinal Tap-episode of the Simpsons, I kind of anticipated a comedic legend, one of the funniest movies in the history of movie-making, but the buildup turned out to be too big for the actual movie. Ideally you would have seen this at 15, an age when rock 'n' roll still really mattered, and when it came out in 1984, at a time when tediously pompous rock bands in spandex were still all the rage and hip hop and ""alternative"" music were still in the offing. Watching it two decades too late makes it appear a bit dated, and the jokes aren't that hard-hitting either.",,Anonymous,Music
One of the Finest Mockumentaries Out There,"40 years ago, the mockumentary format in cinema was considerably re-explored with This Is Spinal Tap. Marking the directorial debut of actor turned filmmaker Rob Reiner and co-conceived by Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer, the film was a modest hit on its original 1984 release but was nonetheless met with critical acclaim, and shortly afterwards it would garner stronger status on home video. Known for satirizing the behaviors of rock & roll bands, there is a lot to appreciate about this film both from its historical context and nowadays, and it might be one of the finest mockumentaries out there.The film is presented from the lens of filmmaker Martin ""Marty"" Di Bergi, who interviews the British rock band Spinal Tap and follows them throughout their American comeback tour, all while the band struggles their way through the difficult industry that threatens to fade them into obscurity. As this film sets itself up as a seemingly legitimate documentary, the whole presentation of the picture feels authentic to the gritty reality that these types of edgy rock bands have to face one way or another. Considering that the actors all improvised their scenes, their dialogue and mannerisms feel so on point to the facade that we're witnessing a British rock & roll band rise and stumble during their attempt to be seen in the spotlight again. Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer come off as appropriately pretentious in their natural performances as David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel and Derek Smalls respectively that you forget you're watching gifted comics honing their improvisational skills. With all the footage we see on screen, there's a lot to marvel at from the lead stars.As for the remaining cast, Rob Reiner is a perfect player as Marty Di Bergi, as his calm yet stern demeanor throughout the band's trials make for a solid contrast between the band member's diluted egos and his rational grasp of what he's capturing from them. The only other more notable characters are Tony Hendra, the band manager whose patience gets scattered due to low concert sales and constant controversy from Spinal Tap's new album cover art, and David's girlfriend Jeanine, whose ideas for stage presentation lead to conflict amongst the group. While most of the remaining characters are still fun to watch, they're not given much time to shine beyond their basic scenarios since the primary focus is supposed to be on the band. What is interesting to note is that many of them consist of funny actors back in their prime like Bruno Kirby, Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, Paul Shaffer and many more. Regardless if you can recognize these people or not, it's always a delight to see these naturally talented people be themselves without the aid of an unnecessary script.In regards to other factors of this film working as a music documentary, one of the funnier funnier qualities that come courtesy of McKean, Guest, Shearer and Reiner are the songs featured throughout the feature. The range of genres that Spinal Tap has covered from 60s skiffle rock to early 80s heavy metal are captured well with hysterical lyrics that are as faithful to the genres they're paying tribute to as much as they are making fun of them. The costume design shown throughout the feature also captures the differences in the band's specific eras, down to their own hairstyles reflecting the decade and influence from the music industry at the time. The factor of the music only coming up when needed helps keep the film's mockumentary take as natural as a real documentary, aided further by the help of the editing tightening the film up in a concise 82 minute runtime. Had the feature been any longer, especially with all the footage they did end up shooting behind the scenes, the gimmick would have run out of steam, so it's a miracle they were able to get a decent cut out of everything.Considering how some people were legitimately fooled on This Is Spinal Tap being a real documentary, its satirical take on both the filmmaking format and the music industry holds up quite well. It was perhaps a bit too ahead of its time to catch on immediately, but the effort that went into crafting its remarkable presentation should never go unseen. Unless you're not a fan of mockumentaries as a whole, this film is worth checking out for its unabashed take on a common subject matter chronicled in documentaries that work well in the movie's favor. Besides, there's a good chance your rating will go up to 11.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Still the best!,"It's over 25 years since I've seen this film and I'd forgotten how funny it is. If I'm honest it's not a laugh out loud romp, but more of an constant face splitting smile-fest. Not only is it one of the most quotable films ever made, but probably one of the more original too. I certainly can't think of many if any mockumentaries that proceed it. Dry cutting humour, ridiculous and lovable characters and as much a love letter to rock as it is a piss-take. What's most enjoyable about watching this, now over 35 years old, is how timeless it feels. Sure you'd assume bands aren't like this anymore, but then assume things at your peril. The reason this is funny though is because there's so much honesty. There's a little truth in every joke they say and this walks then line between hilarity and insightful wonderfully.

Subpar Mockumentary,"As a huge fan of the mockumentary genre (e.g. Zelig, Bob Roberts, Best in Show), I was heartily looking forward to This Is Spinal Tap.  Unfortunately, the film did not live up to my expectations.  While there are a few good gags (although most have already been heavily sampled by sketch comedy shows and repeated ad naseum by too-young-for-Python-quoters), it is on the whole a dull and lackluster affair.  While I applaud Reiner, Guest, McKean and Shearer for attempting something truly great, I cannot join others in heralding its execution.  The songs are at the same time lacking in believability and too close to the source material.  The strife between the band members is overly predicable, with an irritating and chuckle-free Yoko character parading around in `Australian nightmare outfits' and a series of thinly veiled nasty cracks at the late great Keith Moon.  And though it obviously is the model of virtually all of VH1's original programming (e.g. Behind the Music), it does come to a trite and cloying faux-happy ending that puts the Air `thank God Kurt Cobain shot himself' Supply story to shame.  I was pleased to see a youthful Dana Carvey as a mime waiter, and Bruno Kirby gushing over Sinatra, but even an endless supply of pleasant cameos does not a movie make (a lesson Loaded Weapon 1 taught us so well). On the whole, while I might recommend This Is Spinal Tap as an important piece of cinema history, I would not have placed it anywhere near the top 100 comedies of all time.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Oddly ahead of its time, turns out","Tonight on TCM, Ben Mankiewicz told the story of Christopher Guest shopping The Spinal Tap script and a 20-minute short to studio executrives. The performances were so convincing the studio executives were baffled. They thought it was a biographical film of a real group.Apparently, Guest said everyone played it straight, instead of trying to hit a laugh line. And that's the magic of all Guest's film, really. An affection for the subject. And trust that the audience is smart enough to know the source material being satirized.But Ben's introduction also confirmed something I've figured for a long time. Leftyst gasbag Rob Reiner didn't direct this movie any more than I did. He was the name attached to it to get funding. Prove me wrong, America.Half of the fun is figuring out who or which group is getting ripped on. Nigel Tufnel's wife is clearly a riff on Linda McCartney/Yoko Ono. The dead drummer meme is inspired by the deaths of Keith Moon and John Bonham of The Who and Led Zeppelin, respectively. And manager Ian Faith smashing up hotel rooms with his cricket bat is Keith Moon all the way. Tufnel, St Hubbins and Smalls trying to sing Heartbreak Hotel at Elvis's gravesite is The Who doing Barbara Ann for The Kids Are Alright. The Flower People song is The Moody Blues. Stonehenge is Jethro Tull. Michael McKeen is parodying Mick Jagger (his voice, anyway). Tufnel's solos are Eddie Van Halen. Harry Shearer is channeling John Entwistle. The Puppet Show festival concert is Yes or Emerson Lake & Palmer. Tap's hit album in Japan is Cheap Trick (even Tufnel's line delivery is part of the joke, ""He asked Me. To ask You..."").Nevertheless, in retrospect, Tap preceded the great age of declining rock bands. The Who and Queen hadn't even reformed for Live Aid yet, much less gone on retro tours for another 40 years. The Stones hadn't quite descended into self-satire.Watch for cameos by Dana Carvey and Billy Crystal as mimes/servers at the Spinal Tap launch party for their North American tour. But my favorite appearance is Canada's Paul Shaffer, who plays A&R man Artie Fufkin from Polymer Records. Well, and Fred Willard (RIP).

Mockumentary and Improvisation,"It's 1982. Filmmaker Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) follows the comeback tour of legendary British heavy metal band Spinal Tap (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer) in America.Director Rob Reiner started something special here. This form of mockumentary with improvisation may have been done earlier, but Christopher Guest would take it to all new heights. Along with Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, and Rob Reiner, they push the comedy genre to unknown territories. The fact is the jokes are so densely packed and coming out of everywhere that it could be watch over and over again. The improvisation leads to an uncontrolled feeling to the comedy, and a realism that was probably unintended. Unlike other spoofs like Airplane or Naked Gun from Zucker, the jokes aren't machine gun fired. The improvisation lend itself to be uneven and jazzy in nature.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious documentary (rockumentary? Mockumentary?) of the awful and naÃ¯ve metal band.,"This Is Spinal Tap is a very funny look at the durable rock group Spinal Tap. The documentary style filmmaking, mostly handheld, makes it look even more realistic, and makes the band's antics that much more amusing. The film's slim plot is punctuated by interviews with individual band members (some of the funniest parts of the movie), as well as music videos and live performances of the band's god-awful music. No matter how bad their reputation or their sales or their popularity is, they just keep pressing on, assuming that things will pick up soon, and it is an endless source of amusement watching them rationalize their dropping success rate and coming up with reasons that the band should stay together. This is not Oscar winning material. Not by a long shot. None of the actors in the film were well known when it was made, nor are any of them famous today, but the uniqueness and effectiveness of the comedy and of the film as a whole make it worth while.

This Is Spinal Tap,"Mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap was the directorial debut of actor Rob Reiner. It marks a very diverse run of films from Reiner and yet he remains unheralded.

He follows the band Spinal Tap on their disastrous American tour and the release of their new album. It was meant to be a rockumentary but Marty found much much more.This Is Spinal Tap was not something that was discovered by an audience years after its release. It was funny straight off the bat.

For years I thought it was a parody of British rock legends Status Quo who started out as a psychedelic group in the 1960s. Instead it was another rock group called Saxon.A lot of what is captured in the film would make real bands squirm. Both out of embarrassment and familiarity.The sexist album cover. The Stonehenge model that is too small as the designer got the wrong sizes. The band getting stuck in their props. The exploding drummers.It all looks so serious and Guest, McKean and Shearer very much created alongside with Reiner a new form of a comic documentary.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Legendary music comedy but not as funny as I expected,"Everybody who is interested in rock music has probably heard about this movie. It's so popular that even if you haven't seen it you have probably heard its lines quoted somewhere. That was my case too.Maybe I had too high expectations, but I found it only mildly entertaining. There are some funny parts but overall it felt like a bit stale parody, trying too hard to be funny. The case may also be that I'm too deep in the rock & metal culture so that the jokes presented in this movie feel like clichÃ©s - nothing new.I also felt like the movie portrays rockers too stupid. Well, I know that real bands do act very stupid especially when drinking their boredom away during long tours, but... I don't know. Maybe it's just that I'm not generally much into parody style of comedy in general, so it's the delivery that annoys a bit at times.I recommend watching the movie because it's such a legendary piece of history.

For the Future...,"As the years go on, I understand this movie - a mock documentary - may make less and less sense. The best thing to understand is that this is a satire of how music was during a certain time in history. During the 1980s, Heavy Metal music was at its peak. Shrieking vocals. Shredding guitar solos. Lots of studded leather. Lots of hairspray.Understand very clearly that there were some phenomenal musicians during this era. The talent cannot be denied. At the same time, things became as self-absorbed as they were decadent. This movie ""taps"" into the silliest stereotypes - the self-indulgent performer, the embarrassing outfits and behavior, the mismanagement faux pas. This is a commentary on how ridiculous it got. It's sad in a way, because this music genre became a lifestyle for so many. It was community. People felt connected to something. At the same time, the superficial aspect could not be sustained. It was not surprising to hear how so many musicians from the era were bothered by the portrayals. It hit very close to home.Have fun with it. Watch and enjoy for what it was...

No surprise, then, that there is a 2023 sequel in the works for This Is Spinal Tap.Guess, McKean, and Shearer are all accomplished musicians in several genres and perform as Tap - they've even done a few live shows as Tap.

Spinal Tap!,"This Is Spinal Tap is a mockumentary (fictional documentary) released in 1984. The film tells the story of the fictional British band Spinal Tap on their US tour.Many point to this film as ""one of the best comedies of all time"", but, as much as I really think a film is very funny, the point that most catches my attention is the part of the false documentary, it is amazing how the film succeeds perfectly reproduce a common documentary, it is not for nothing that many unsuspecting people confused the film with a real documentary at the time of its release, moreover. as much as it is a low budget film it is very well produced, in addition to all this, the film manages to perfectly blend humor with fake documentary, and all of his jokes work and many of these jokes (in fact almost all) were improvised by the actors .The mockumentary genre already existed at the time, but it was this feature that popularized the genre and undoubtedly one of (perhaps the best) film of its kind, unfortunately the film was not very successful at the time, but a few years later with the commercialization of VHS, the feature won cult status, and finally had its genius recognized and in 2002 the film entered the collection of the Library of Congress of the USA of films that need to be preserved due to their extreme cultural and historical importance.

OG groundbreaking Mockuntary,"""This Is Spinal Tap"" is a legendary mockumentary film that stands as an enduring masterpiece of comedy and satire. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by its stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer, this film has rightfully earned its place in the pantheon of cult classics.The brilliance of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" lies in its genius concept and its pitch-perfect execution. The film follows the fictional rock band Spinal Tap on a tumultuous tour, capturing the absurdity, ego, and chaos of the rock 'n' roll world. The mockumentary style allows for a seamless blend of improvisation and scripted hilarity, making every scene feel spontaneous and fresh.The characters are a comedic tour de force. From David St. Hubbins (McKean) to Nigel Tufnel (Guest) and Derek Smalls (Shearer), each band member is a caricature of rock stereotypes, with their quirks and idiosyncrasies pushed to the extreme. Their absurd conversations and exaggerated personalities never fail to elicit laughter.The satirical jabs at the music industry and the rock star lifestyle are both sharp and affectionate. The film expertly parodies the excesses of the era, from the over-the-top stage props (Stonehenge, anyone?) to the band's revolving door of drummers, each meeting a bizarre or unfortunate fate. It's an incisive critique of the superficiality and absurdity of the music business.The film's iconic moments are too numerous to count, from the band's inability to find the stage, the infamous amp that goes to eleven, to the hilarious and cringe-worthy lyrics of their songs. The humor is incredibly clever and resonates with anyone who has ever been a fan of rock music.The genius of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" lies in its timeless appeal. Even though it was made in the 1980s, its humor and satire are as relevant today as they were then. This is a film that can be watched and re-watched, with every viewing revealing new layers of wit and absurdity.The authenticity of the performances is remarkable, as the actors convincingly portray their characters as real people, blurring the lines between fiction and reality. The commitment to their roles is commendable and adds to the film's immersion.""This Is Spinal Tap"" is an uproarious, unforgettable journey into the world of rock and its larger-than-life personalities. With its unparalleled wit, memorable characters, and timeless satire, it's a film that never goes out of style. Whether you're a music aficionado or just a fan of great comedy, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is an absolute must-see that continues to ""turn it up to eleven"" in the world of cinema.Regenerate.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
What Is Funny?,"This movie really points up how widely people's conceptions of humor can vary. I've heard of this movie for years, and have always heard that it was very funny.What finally got me to watch it was William Goldman's commentary on the DVD for ""The Princess Bride"". That has always been one of my favorite movies -- very funny. But if you see and hear Goldman talk, you'd think he'd never so much as cracked a smile in his life. It amazed me that someone who looks and sounds so gloomy could do something so light and funny as Princess Bride.In describing how he managed to get together with Rob Reiner, Goldman said he'd seen ""Spinal Tap"" and had never laughed so hard in his life, and had tears rolling down his face. I thought, ""If it could make *him* laugh, it must really be funny."" So I watched it.I think I chuckled once or twice.Don't get me wrong -- I'm not criticizing those who do find it funny. Like I say, it just points out what amazingly wide variation there is in what people consider funny.Beyond not being very funny (to me), the movie was in fact moderately interesting just as a documentary of a rock band.

The first rockumentary in history is indeed an absolute success, and we can no longer count the number of times we will refer to it; from ""The Simpsons"" to ""Wayne's World"" which has never hidden its parentage.In its parody, ""Spinal Tap"" distils an incontestable truth about rock groups and abounds with winks that everyone will recognize.

This is Spinal Tap,"So the legendary British rockers ""Spinal Tap"" are on the comeback trail. After a dry spell in the USA, they determine to take their provocative new album and their film-faking fan ""Marty"" (Rob Reiner) and re-establish themselves as superstars. ""Marty"" has access to all aspects of their activities as he makes the ultimate fly-on-the-wall documentary depicting the ups and downs, warts and all, of this band of musicians who epitomise just about everything good, bad and excessive in the industry at which this film takes an entertaining swipe. Interspersed with some decently staged rock numbers that could easily have been seen on MTV, we are exposed to the extremes of venality and avarice, some completely bonkers lyrics and their gradual realisation that the grand stadium days are maybe long gone, now. The bickering always stays on the amiable side of toxic, but squabbles about their racy album cover being banned in Walmart, their shrinking appeal narrowed now to just to stoned-out students and their own peccadilloes deliver an enjoyably authentic looking and frequently quite funnily written analysis of life on the downward side of the showbiz mountain - and it's quite scathing of those who make a living out of it with little or no talent but a solid belief in what they see in the mirror.

"Improv Delight in One of the First, and Finest, Mockumentaries","A classic, scathing lampoon of every successful rock band that's ever been guilty of taking themselves too seriously. Rob Reiner directs (and plays an important supporting role) but it seems like all he really needed to do was point a camera in the right direction, then edit several hours' worth of golden improvisational delight into a concise, intelligible ninety-minute package. It's a roaring parade of nonstop laughs, some blunt and easy, others sharp and witty. Famous bits like Christopher Guest's ""this one goes to eleven"" have been played to death but still elicit smiles, while deeper cuts, such as the band's reaction to contemporary critics or their infamous Stonehenge performance, land as if they were brand new. And the music is great, too, not just as a cutting satire, but as a convincing love letter to the days when power rock was all the rage and flocks of buzzed, well-feathered teens would still pack a stadium to hear the loudest noise on the planet.

Reading the responses I see many have their own personal reasons for lower ratings (didn't like the bickering at the end, although I thought that it added and reflected rock group infighting). I'm going to dwell on the positive. 80% improvised it's comedic genius through and through. How many of you knew that, and that Howard Hessman (RIP recently) was called after the original manager for the other rock group couldn't improvise?The songs are rock genius too imho. Obviously for their comedic value, and although I'm not a rock critic or a music expert I frikkin' *love* their songs! I even karaoke a few! I've seen them in concert in SF... when they flew in on guidelines... and of course Derek hovered over the stage while roadies desperately tried to get him down (shades of the ""Clamshell Incident.""

Comedy just doesn't get any better than this,"It's probably easiest just cutting to the chase with this one and to lay my cards out on the table and state that I consider This is Spinal Tap to possibly be the best comedy film ever made. With this movie, director Rob Reiner along with fellow writer/actors Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest devised a type of comedy that it took decades for everybody else to catch up with. The trick was that they delivered very funny material in a manner that always held on to reality. There is never any over comic acting or nudging to camera, the humour is consistently grounded in reality and that is core quality of the film. Many of the very best subsequent TV comedies have taken this approach religiously, such as 'I Am Alan Partridge', 'The Office', 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' â€“ amongst many others. The influence of Spinal Tap is immeasurable in this sense. Back in the early 80's this comedy style was pretty uncommon and hence many thought that this mockumentary was in fact a documentary.The performances are crucial with the three leads being particularly brilliant and all side characters being quite excellent as well. A lot of the dialogue was improvised and this explains the naturalistic flow of things â€“ you can easily re-watch this and discover brilliant lines buried in overlapping dialogue for example. This is one of those films that really doesn't feel like it should be reviewed in the traditional sense because there are simply far too many moments of comedy genius that recounting them all would take forever. It's quite simply a movie that just needs to be seen. It never gets old in any way and remains as funny now as it ever was.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

After touring for most of the last few years, I can honestly say that things like getting lost backstage, getting booed, getting bad reviews, having equipment malfunction, having band members fight, promotional stunts go wrong, etc. isn't really funny anymore. I heard an interview with Ozzy Osbourne in which he said he didn't think Spinal Tap was funny because most of that stuff has happened to him. Any other professional musicians out there had a similar feeling? Don't get me wrong, I still love this movie, but too much of it rings true to me now.",,Anonymous,Music

It's subtle you can't really half listen to this while doing a commute on a train or something. But if you pay attention, you realise that this is like fire and ice and you are in the middle like lukewarm water.Multiple rock bands in the 1980s watched this film and were convinced that it was about them, this is how realistic it is. Saying that though it is a loving tribute to the hair metal of the late 70s on into the 80s. The songs are pretty catchy, but are also dripping in the misogyny of the time, deliberately so.

This is Spinal Tap: 7/10,"In this rockumentary, Rob Reiner (who also directs) plays Marty Di Bergi, a filmmaker. He's taping the day to day life of the aging rock group Spinal Tap.The three members that we actually learn and care about are David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean, lead guitar and vocals), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest, lead guitar and vocals) and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer, bass and vocals). Hey, that name works, since we barely get to see Derek at all, and his part is so small.Spinal Tap, in most parts, is funny, with the band overreacting to small sandwiches to a three foot high Stonehenge. It is hard, however, to understand or hear all of them since they use British accents and there are no subtitles on the DVD. They did put too many characters in, since I do not know how Fran Dresher got into it or anything.The movie must be the shortest musical ever created, clocking in at 83 minutes. Even so, it stretches the premise out for way too long and would have been better as a half hour or even an hour TV special.There were a fair number of jokes, as I've said before, but they don't ""crack you up"", they just hit you and you give a short laugh. Spinal Tap is entertaining, and all of the main actors are good. Reiner (who also co-scripted with the three leads) seemed to not know he was acting, but his part wasn't very demanding. The wigged band members (who did all their own singing) played their part like they were Spinal Tap. Michael McKean is one of my favorites, and Harry Shearer is from my favorite TV show, The Simpsons.This is Spinal Tap is a usually funny and entertaining but too stretched out comedy that can get your toes a'tapping and your mouth a'smiling.My rating: 7/10Rated R for language.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Does not go up to 11,"This is probably the most over rated comedy ever, in part due to the rambling, semi-improvisatory nature of it. The scene in which they get lost back stage and end up going round in circles pretty much sums up much of the film for me. A tighter script and a lot of editing would have helped.The film does have its funny moments and of course some lines of dialogue which have become iconic. Its not as funny as it thinks it is though and some of the jokes, such as the exploding drummers, do not fit easily into the generally realistic tone of the rest. The songs are superb parodies, in someways superior to what they are parodying. However, some of the set piece concert scenes, like the film itself, does drag in places due to its lack of focus.While Christopher Guest and Michael McKean are very good, the cast is not universally up to the same standard; even Harry Shearer, later famous as the voice of Mr Burns, is a virtual shadow in the film. Other band members only get to speak during the final screen credits.This film has become highly influential, itself not necessarily a good thing, since ab-libbing is an art which few do well.All in all a decent comedy, but far from being the towering classic it is claimed by some.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I'm rooting for a This Is Spinal Tap spinoff where we look into the lives of most Pop/Rap/EDM/ Alternative artists today.

A struggling filmmaker follows along with Spinal Tap to do a documentary of their tour. Things start off ok, but the band goes on to have all sorts of problems from misunderstanding's within the band, not being able to find the stage and the cover of their new album. This leads to some in fighting and eventually a new direction. But all is not lost! The lead characters are likeable in an empty headed way.

"Brilliant, the quintessential definition of mockumentary","This movie should be funny for everyone. But if you're a musician, more specifically a rock musician who is familiar with the 60s, 70s and 80s music image and progression, this could not get funnier because of how well it mocks the nature of the culture, which some just may not get and the reason for some of the poor reviews. But if you're looking for a light comedy that anyone can enjoy about our dim-witted, image conscious, world of sex, drugs and rock and roll, this is a fun comedic trip.In short - Britian's ""loudest"" band, known for the sexual bad-assery of the 60s, is trying to make a comeback in the more socially and politicially aware 80s in the US, where raw sexual innuendo which some may find degrading, especially to women, is no longer en vogue. Meet Marti di Bergi, documentary film maker who follows the band on tour to reconstruct the great (fake) history of this band through the ages, the friendship of long time band members, and the ongoing success story in the next era... or so they think.But our non-mean spirited band members are clueless that they have never grown up and evolved from the 60s and 70s and are still stuck in their own time warp of writing ""clever"" sexual innuendo songs and all sorts of fantasy that made for the 60s and 70s glam rock era. What was expected to be a whirlwind tour to tens of thousands of screaming fans turns into the tour spiraling ever downwards to new depths. The stars personalities get in each others way over time, exploring every rock-n-roll drama that many musicians are familiar in a very amusing way. Much of the lingo is extremely clever, musicians will pick up on many of the subtleties, those who don't might miss it and just be amused generally by the drama.I think what makes this film so much fun to watch is that there was no forced script. This was 3 actors who are musicians who lived, breathed, ate and slept in the UK and fully enveloped themselves in their bit parts, right down to the accents. The cameos of famous actors (many who weren't famous then) is mind boggling and each bit part from great talent is what makes this movie such a fun watch as a whole.Whether or not you appreciate this film, it is absolutely an icon of mockumentaries and the one that set them up.

If I could give this film an 11 like what's on the amplifier I would,"Fantastic, hilarious mockumentary with excellent performances, fantastic dialogue, and superb direction by former television star Rob Reiner in his feature film directorial debut.Its easy to see why this film has become so much more popular since it was released nearly 40 years ago and it doesnt feel dated one bit.All of the cast is American but they seem naturally British like the band they are portraying.It's sad that Rob Reiner started his directorial career with excellence like this which lasted through the 80's but sadly after directing the huge bomb North in 1994 he has never been the all-star director he once was.Still his work before North is all excellent and still worth revisiting today and this film is no exception.Lots of the great directors like Hitchcock, Spielberg, Kubrick, and Coppola had either lukewarm or horrible directorial debuts but Reiner managed to strike gold with his very first film. This was a guy who really knew what he was doing when transitioning from All in the Family to being a Hollywood director.If you haven't seen this it is a must. If you have give it another rewatch it holds up magnificently.While I miss the greatness Rob Reiner gave us in the 80's with his films and wish it would transition into his directorial efforts in this day and age there is no denying this man has a fine talent for directing good comedies with the right script and this film is a jewel of an example of what a well written comedy screenplay should be.I cant give it an 11 like the amplifier in the movie has but I would if possible. I however have no hesitancy in giving it the highest rating possible of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Evening Aberdeen!,"BBC4 last night showed the legendary 1976 documentary, So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star, which is said to have been the inspiration behind Spinal Tap. At last I got to see it! If you missed it, make sure you're watching the next time the BBC repeats it (which doubtlessly it'll be doing for years). It takes up just over an hour of your time, and it is hilarious.The group featured in the documentary, The Kursaal Flyers, are also second-rate, but far seedier than Spinal Tap. The documentary starts with Pocket Money, a song that contains a riff you'll quickly recognise from the film. The lyrics are stupid, the instrumental is bad, and the group have attitude. Their conversations are unbelievably plonking. And the documentary just goes on like this, swinging from bathos to bathos. The director must have known he had a classic.In writing this, I don't mean to diminish Rob Reiner's film in any way at all, only to guide you to a wonderful documentary that will greatly add to your pleasure.",,Anonymous,Music

The gold standard of the modern mockumentary,"Arguably the father, and for sure the gold standard of the modern mockumentary, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" showed audiences how razor fine the line can be between truth and hilarious fiction. A satire of '70s rock 'n roll bands, the film is hysterical because of how closely it resembles a real rock band and mirrors many truths about the music industry.With a script largely driven by improvisation from stars Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and Rob Reiner (who also directs), ""Spinal Tap"" relies on this talent pool to create an entertaining product. The film consists of little more than interviews between Reiner's ""director"" Marty DiBergi and band members David St. Hubbins (McKean), Nigel Tufnel (Guest) and Derek Smalls (Shearer), footage from their American tour and some candid conversations. What makes the story interesting is not what happens, but the character dynamics/interpersonal drama.Merely the scenario that Spinal Tap is a band in the twilight of its career, with its popularity at an all time low, creates enough opportunities for tension and movement in the story. With all of this comes creative differences, blame and flaring tempers. All these elements are true of rock bands enduring difficult times and that framework successfully guides the characters' quirkiness.The music is also a big part of why the film works. The cast members are actual musicians with a great degree of talent, which creates authenticity, to the point that Spinal Tap could actually be a band. This is an entertaining and believable act, and what happens to them, though to the point of being amusing, also falls well within the realm of likelihood. The classic miscommunication about the Stonehenge stage prop is hysterical, but in this quiet, reasonable, almost graceful way.Subtlety is really the hallmark of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and its cast. Once a mockumentary film starts to lean too hard on hilarious scenarios, it starts to bleed over into the genre of situational comedy, and that's when you start to think less about the veracity of what you're watching as an audience and more about the writing. A great documentary never becomes so transparent that you can see its ""script,"" and the same holds true of effective mockumentaries. ""Spinal Tap"" is genius because you can rarely see the comedy cogs at work â€” they emerge naturally from a talented cast that had a brilliant idea.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Fails to amuse,"Now some parts of this movie were funny, but overall Christopher Guest annoys me to no end in all three of his major films (this one, Guffman, and Best of Show).  At the time, when rock was king, this film was probably a lot more relevant.  But I'm 22, and the old rockers and 80's hair bands were fading quickly when I started listening to music.  I've seen VH1 documentaries and know enough about the ""rock 'n' roll"" lifestyle to get the jokes.  I also get Guest's subtle, dry sense of humor and where the jokes are, but I just don't laugh.  Perhaps I reject his basic tenet of humor based on laughing at other people's stupidity (in the way he does it).  I believe this movie and the other two in Guest's pathetic trilogy are solely for that special breed of popular kids in high school that overtly or covertly relished in every moment of their supremacy.  This one's for you, wodies.  Then check out Guffman, you'll laugh your head off.  6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Sheer Brilliance And Utter Stupidity!,"This film is almost the very definition of a cult comedy classic. It is an outrageously funny mixture of sheer brilliance - on the part of the film-makers - and utter stupidity (the uproarious situational gags that the ""band"" find themselves in and their typically ridiculous quips and one-liners, wittily ad-libbed by the actors). In fact, it's just like the hard rock & heavy metal genres themselves, along with many of the musicians who play and tour the music - brilliant and boneheaded at the same time - which is why I love them! If you're a fan of improvisational comedy, mockumentaries, hard rock/ metal, campy silliness or you just want to watch a classic, tongue-in-cheek comedy, do yourself a favour - you'll be quoting it ad infinitum thereafter, with friends who are also ""in the know""... Most people probably don't realize that the rating on IMDb for this film goes ""up to 11""! Watch the film to find out why...

Entertaining,"Mockumentaries can be a lot of fun, and this was one of the early movies in t he genre. The film mocks the entire culture surrounding rock stars, exposing how vapid these people are. But it doesn't do it in an offensive way, as the protagonists are very likeable. What bothered me a bit was that they went a bit too far with the crazy stuff at times, and played it way too straight. The fictitious band actually went on to build a career, in character, which I find rather bizarre. If the actors won't recognize they are in on the joke, the whole thing becomes overburdened in the end. The director, Rob Reiner, also proved to be a very unlikable individual later in his career, which brings a somewhat bitter aftertaste to the viewing experience. But hey, it's still a very funny movie that everyone should watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A comedic masterpiece,"A comedic masterpiece.A documentary producer/director, Marty DiBergi, follows the hard- rock band Spinal Tap around on their reunion tour of the US. This is the outcome: a rock documentary - a rockumentary. Through interviews of the band he covers their history and creative processes, and captures some of their behind-the-scenes interactions. He also films some of their concerts and music. There's a reason they're not that well known...One of the funniest movies ever made. A great spoof of rock music, and the music industry in general. Just about every scene and line is iconic and quotable (eg ""Our amps go up to eleven"", the saga of the drummers).Very relatable too, especially to anyone who follows rock music. So many scenes that remind you just how superficial, pretentious and sometimes plain stupid rock musicians can be. Cringingly close to reality at times.Brilliant beyond description.

What a great movie.,"I have known about this movie for years and it was one of those movies that I would eventually get round to watching. As it turned out, last week, I saw it at the video library and decided there and then it was time to see what the fuss was all about. I had the movie for a good week before I finally sat and started to watch it, and I had abit of reluctancy at first viewing. I didn't watch the entire movie but a couple of days later, I sat down on my own and watched it right through. Without distractions, I finally realized what a great movie this is, it was actually quite funny. It is one of those movies that I need to watch more than once to get the jokes behind the movie, and the fact that this is a mockumentary of a fictitious band.From the feedback and internet comments I have read, it appears to be close to the mark, and this is what made this movie such a fun movie to watch. Like Shaun of the Dead that watched a month or so ago, This Is Spinal Tap will be one of those movies that I must have in my collection and watch it at least once or twice a year.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Some call it a classic,"Rating-7/10This is Spinal Tap is a film that has a cult following and I can kind of see why, but not completely. It has it's many moments and I can't deny laughs were had throughout but part of me did feel it was overrated or one of those cult following films that aren't as good as others say. I felt it was solidly good though and here below is why so.The story is slow at first and the jokes don't flow as crazily as the story but nevertheless jokes come off the reel with skill and precision. I liked everything that is going on and I actually preferred the arguments they all have to the music they play. I did enjoy the music pieces and some the concert scenes can be hilarious and well done, the movie does excel in making what could be stupid jokes into actual smart ones.The casting is very varied but they all work together well, all of the main cast do a good job and to say it is a mockumentary style film they really take to the part well. I like the more random cast more and the little funny bits really stem from strange encounters the band have. I think Rob Reiner does a good job not only delivering the questions as he the documentary maker but also reacts really well too.On to Rob Reiner again and he just happens to direct and co write this movie too so all round Reiner really shows skill and although I believe it could be funnier than it was, he still does a massively solid job. Written by some of the main cast Christoper Guest, Michael McKean, Harry Shearer and of course Reiner, This is Spinal Tap has quick smart jokes and really allows the viewer to laugh at anything.My main criticism is at the jokes, it is funny as I did feel it was a tip top movie but part of me wanted to laugh more and for what some people say, it isn't all that interesting either. It can bore you and with me I felt it doesn't get off the mark well but does manage actually to make some good jokes in the start so I'll give it that.I think this movie was created for rock fans and comedy fans a like and it really has a target demographic. I also felt whilst watching that some people will find it funnier than I did and although I did laugh quite a lot, there are more to be had here. Many will not like it and think of it as kind of stupid and silly but I feel here you have to want to watch it rather than just see if it is funny at all.Overall I gave it a 7/10 and felt it was solidly in that but it could have maybe gone up just a little with a few things. In conclusion this isn't a film that I absolutely loved but could easily see others loving it, this really will come down to what you want in film and what you want to see, but then again anyone should give it a go, and you should in general laugh quite a bit if you have a funny bone.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
11/10,"The greatest mockumentary ever! The best satirical take on the whole Rock N' Roll lifestyle. Chronicles the US tour of the ""world's loudest band"" Spinal Tap. During the tour everything that can go wrong will go wrong. The band, it's members and songs are absolutely hilarious. So many funny and memorable scenes and quotes it's pointless to name the best ones. This one goes up to eleven!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Talented on stage; crazy off stage,"Filmed in documentary style, this fiction film chronicles the ups and downs on a rock band on tour with a penchant for outrageousness. The songs are highly memorable throughout (especially 'Big Bottom' and 'Stonehenge') and kooky touches include a party in which all the waiters are mimes and, of course, the amplifier that goes up to 11. This is not, however, the easiest film to get through. Innovative as Rob Reiner's choice to shoot the film as a mockumentary no doubt is, the content soon grows repetitive with the band members saying one dumb thing after another, whether it be professing that spontaneous combustion in humans exists or stating that the insides of a human body look green and blue. Much better dark humour comes in the form of a running gag in which it is gradually revealed that dozens of drummers in the band have died in mysterious circumstances over the years, with the band's current drummer claiming that ""the law of averages"" should keep him safe (!) - and yet, the focus here is always on the ridiculous things the band members say and the misfortunes they experience along the way. Along such lines, the film pokes sharply at the notion that talent and intelligence are not always aligned in life, but whether this dynamic is enough to sustain the film is debatable. Certainly, the film has a hardy fan-base with some regarding it as one of the funniest films ever made, and as it is often said, comedy is the most subjective genre out there. This is a worthwhile movie, but probably best appreciated by those keenly interested in rock music.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Playful mockumentary with just a whiff of smugness,"Rob Reiner directed this self-amused mockumentary on an outdated glitter-rock group named Spinal Tap, whose members are unaware how far they've fallen out of favor. This material might have made for the perfect short; yet as accurate as many of the jokes and targets are, the one-note satirical routines do get stretched a bit thin. The straight-faced cast, in an early precursor to the Christopher Guest troupe of players, is sometimes riotous-sometimes not, though Reiner is very adept with this type of dryly silly, scrappy film-making and he has a lot of fun with it. For music-biz aficionados, this became something of a cult film. It's low-budget, and definitely low-brow, but there are some big laughs scattered about. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A cult movie of particular taste...A classic film.,"Spinal Tap has a specific audience that it appeals to, and that is the cult audience.  Particularly, those of them that are musicians.  To the working musician, this movie is packed with hilarious in-jokes and giggle-worthy moments.  If one is also well versed in music culture, and knows all about the different bands through-out the 60s, 70s and 80s, (The Beatles, Kiss and Queen for example), then the jokes in this movie will have meaning.  If not, then one will find themselves lost, and the movie will seem pretty slow and bland.Of special interest to some may be Christopher Guest's musical performances as Nigel Tufnel, (He played Count Rugen in The Princess Bride), and Harry Shearer's (His voice is heard as most of the characters in The Simpsons) as the likeable Derek Smalls.  Guest's singing voice is very sweet, which is a complete opposite to the rough sound of the band.  They work well together, however.For those in the music know, this movie is non-stop classic hilarity, but if you're not savvy to the culture the humour will be lost on you.",,Anonymous,Music

Incredibly funny: a true comedy classic.,"Comedic actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer show off their fantastic ability to improvise in this dead on parody of rock documentaries. Rob Reiner, making his feature film directing debut, and who co-wrote the script with the stars, plays a documentary filmmaker who decides to chronicle the latest tour of a veteran rock group that has clearly seen much better days.The movie features a very high amount of gags that actually work, and one can believe that, yeah, crazy stuff like this could very well happen in the world of rock 'n' roll. Among the best are the conceptual drawings of the band (""This is what you'd look like as a crab.""), the recreation of a piece of Stonehenge that is nowhere near as large as the band wanted, the amplifier that goes to 11, Nigels' description of a heart warming piece he's composed, and a truly gut busting sequence wherein the cover art for the bands' latest album is discussed.The three main actors are all wonderful and show a real talent for, and knowledge of, music as well as comedy, which really helps to create a level of believability. Some of their dialogue is truly hilarious. There's a lot of familiar faces in the supporting cast; the cameos are a delight.As a bonus, the music is really pretty good, and are accompanied by some of the silliest / most brilliant lyrics you'll ever hear.At 83 minutes in length, this doesn't go on any longer than it has to, and it maintains a superb forward momentum the entire time, coming up with one great laugh after another and remaining fresh and unpredictable.Highly recommended.Eight out of 11.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Okay, but it's nowhere near a 7.9 average","""This is Spinal Tap"" is a mock-rock-doc about Spinal Tap, a band that turns out to be full of self-centered individuals whose artistic genius barely makes up for their personal abrasiveness.

The songs, though, are probably actually better than they were supposed to be, except the ridiculous Stonehenge number.

Still funny - but real life bands have surpassed this parody,"Back in 1984, there was no VH-1, hence no ""Where Are They Now"", or ""Behind The Music"". Also in 1984, we hadn't yet heard of Winger, Skid Row, Slaughter, Poison, or any of the other ""hair bands"" that we hate to love.Hence, ""This Is Spinal Tap"" was a blistering parody of British heavy metal rock that was just really coming into stride around that time in '84. The scenes involving the Stonehenge set, the fight between the band's manager and lead singer's girlfriend (obviously a nod to Yoko Ono), any of the absolutely ridiculous ""videos"" and ""concert performances"" (Sex Farm, Bitch School, Big Bottom) are all still quite funny and well done - except maybe a little sobering now, especially when you realize that the real bands ""the Tap"" are spoofing (those that came out in the late 80s ""hair metal"" boom) were often as silly, clueless and destined for obscurity as this fictional group of guys is...It's also fun to play ""spot the cameo""... many are obvious, some not so obvious, but we have folks like Howard Hessman, Fran Drescher, Paul Schaffer, Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, and others popping their faces into a scene here and there.""This is Spinal Tap"" is still a funny movie, it's just that the antics of real life musicians (Tommy Lee's sex tape, anybody?) have severely lessened this movie's satirical impact.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

What once was fresh is now clichÃ©,"I remember seeing this on its original release and was very amused by it all. Here was a very funny low budget comedy that was actually funnier the more you knew. Unfortunately time has not been kind to Spinal Tap. While its importance in the history of film and culture can not be under estimated, the past 20 odd years have made it a clichÃ©. Everyone has ripped it off or referenced it including all of those involved in it. Thats fine, however it makes sitting through it rather difficult since you've seen most of the jokes before, even if you haven't seen the movie before. I suppose there is some consolation that this was the seed from which a thousand mockumentaries and two million jokes sprung, but when you want to see a funny movie it kind of takes the laughter out of the evening.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
This is One of the Funniest Films of All Time!,"One of the funniest films of all time, and certainly one of the cleverest, ""This is Spinal Tap"" is as equally hysterical and subtle today as it was twenty years ago, back when Rob Reiner was pretty much known for his iconic role on the television show ""All in the Family"" -- not yet for ""The Princess Bride,"" ""When Harry Met Sally..."", ""A Few Good Men,"" and certainly not for being an excellent director. (Now, by 2004, his films have occupied many of the various AFI lists, including the best romance films and comedies.)""This is Spinal Tap"" was the first of its kind -- a so-called ""rockumentary"" following the dissipation of a terrible British hard rock band during the mid-80s, with songs like ""Sex Farm"" ample proof of their considerably awful talent.Tons of bands like Spinal Tap were popular during the 1980s, then soon fell out of the public eye. Not many of them even had much talent at all -- just drugged-out band members and lots of rebellious attitudes as their primary advertising campaign.Because Spinal Tap is so close to reality, and because it is so ridiculously ironic and yet far-fetched, it has achieved a massive army of fans and even a famed Criterion Collection DVD (now out of print, unfortunately). The film was never exactly a smash at the box office, but its popularity -- like so many famous films -- grew rapidly over the years since its release, having gradual re-releases (the sure-fire sign of a cult film) and lots of fake reunion concerts. (One of which was recently released onto a DVD.)Legend has it that after the film was released in 1984, people often came up to Rob Reiner on the street and they would say, ""I really liked your movie, but I wish you would have chosen a more popular band to do a film on.""Yes, Spinal Tap is absolutely false. It's not a real band. But it's hard to tell at times. Some people don't like the film because they find it too real -- but I think that's the whole idea.As the film fades into focus, we are introduced to Marty DiBergi (Reiner), a documentary film maker who was drawn to Spinal Tap, the UK heavy metal rock band, early on in their career -- he admired their ""loud"" songs and now, at the height of their career, he is setting out to record their private lives that exist behind the stage.The three main rockers are Nigel (Christopher Guest), David (Michael McKean), and Derek (Harry Shearer), who go around the world on rock tours, inspiring lots of loud noise amongst fans and upsetting a lot of people -- like the limo driver played by Bruno Kirby (""The Godfather Part II"") in a pre-""When Harry Met Sally"" cameo. (Billy Crystal also makes a cameo as a mime waiter in one of the most subtle scenes -- look quick, you might miss him.)The cast performed all their own songs, as well as writing them. Guest, McKean and Shearer are all gifted musicians -- but they're also pretty funny. Part of what makes this film so effective on repeat viewings is that you're guaranteed to find some things you didn't notice last time. John Hughes once said that he liked to place small background quirks in his films (such as the crawling mice in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"") so that, on repeat viewings on television, someone watching might drift from the main focus of the film to the background of the sequence -- and there's the hidden gag that isn't even all that funny, just...different.Your first viewing of ""Spinal Tap"" might be less than enthusastic. But I beg of you, watch it again, take a chance to open your ears more, pay attention to small things in the background, and listen to those songs the guys are singing. That's where much of the comedy lies. This is a film that is definitely worth owning for such purposes.Speaking of hidden elements, much has been said -- or rather implied -- about the homosexuality of Nigel. When David's girlfriend joins them for the tour, his heart sinks because he loves him. I dunno, I've always thought it was because they were childhood friends and Nigel doesn't want anyone to take David away from him for friendship reasons. (Although the line ""We're closer than brothers..."" makes you wonder.)This mockumentary formula has been re-created time and time again since ""This is Spinal Tap,"" even in films such as ""The Blair Witch Project.""But the mockumentary style has been mimicked particularly by Guest, who starred in -- and directed -- ""Waiting for Guffman,"" ""Best in Show,"" and most recently, 2003's ""A Mighty Wind."" Michael McKean and Harry Shearer returned for these entries, and I'm thinking that the next film should be a collaborative effort, and should reunite everyone from ""Spinal Tap"" for a 20-year anniversary -- Reiner, Guest, McKean, Shearer, the cast from Guest's mockumentaries, and perhaps even Crystal and Kirby, et al., in cameos. I'm sure more than a few people would go to see it. And, unlike so many other films, it is one that actually deserves a sequel. And probably one that would be just as funny as the first. And one that would have a purpose, other than being just another cash-in. Anyone interested in what happened to the band members twenty years after their downfall? I know I do.But this is getting off the point, and the point is that none of these Guest mockumentaries -- as good as they are -- come close to the pure greatness of ""This is Spinal Tap,"" and ""A Mighty Wind"" -- although funny -- started to show signs of formula aging. But ""This is Spinal Tap"" was, is, and always shall be, the granddaddy of the mockumentaries. It's the ""Psycho"" of mockumentaries, and actually a lot of ""regular"" comedies, too.5/5 stars.",,Anonymous,Music

Hilarious British comedic gold,"""This Is Spinal Tap"" directed by Rob Reiner and written by Spinal Tap themselves - was an excellent experience.Hilarious, original humour. Great dynamics in the writing and acting conveyed through the band members. Even the songs, apart from their self-aware, atrocious lyrics, are excellent and even performed convincingly by the actors.A true comedic gem, finely paced at 82 minutes for its
original mockumentary premise.Highly recommended for any night of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Sendup of rock history,"As far as mockumentaries go, 'This is Spinal Tap' is occasionally quite funny if not 100% convincing. Apparently some of the original audience took it at face value, believing that Spinal Tap was a real band, but it at times seemed a bit contrived, not as deliriously persuasive as Peter Jackson's 'Forgotten Silver'.In this directorial debut (which gives little indication of the heights he would scale or the depths to which he would fall) Rob Reiner uses the fictional band Spinal Tap to send-up rock culture in Britain and the United States, an ample target indeed. Everything from the banal flamboyance of Queen, the craziness of AC/DC, and the pretensions of the Beatles is turned up to 11 in the band's members.Their shows contain elaborate set-pieces (which are prone to malfunctioning). Their songs, including such hits as 'Big Bottoms' and 'Sex Farm' are ridiculous parodies, but somehow not that different from rock lyrics in general (especially those from Queen). There are many in-jokes about rocker culture: gags about the fascination with Eastern philosophy, choking to death on 'someone else's' vomit, etc. One of the band leaders has a Yoko Ono-esque girlfriend who threatens Spinal Tap's unity. It's all a bit crass but also a deserving send-up.Reiner, as the film's 'fictional' director, walks through Spinal Tap's origin, from their beginning as British Invasion Beatles rip-offs to hippies to heavy metal rockers. It's here that the authenticity starts to waver since I'm not sure if any bands in real life transformed from flower power to Alice Cooper-style shenanigans. Maybe Reiner never set out to be convincing: he's instead giving an exaggerated history of rock'n'roll itself, which is what makes the movie interesting.An interesting note: even though a major plot element is that Spinal Tap's popularity is declining, nearly every time they perform we see them surrounded by screaming, adoring fans. It's not just rock stars being spoofed; it's rock audiences.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
I am Rewatching Old Mockumentaries,"This was where the genre began. It's nearly perfect.

So I suppose when some other similar style movies have come along like Man Bites Dog and What We Do In the Shadows, I feel like they have stood on shoulders and done better. But only slightly.Christopher Guest is the real genius in this movie. His performance is top-notch.

I guess this how dry British humour comes across in music?,"I can see why people would adore this film, but I guess I was never in the best milieu for it. I was never that deeply interested in the kind of music parodied by the titular band, so while I can understand the jokes fine enough, and laugh every once in a while, it just didn't resonate all that much with me.In large part, it's because the delivery of everything is intentionally flat and matter-of-fact to stay in keeping with the mockumentary approach. While I guess this adds to the authenticity for the fans, I ended up just shrugging at their arguments over sandwiches or covers or what not more often than not. In particular, I was surprised just how much more subdued ""this goes to 11"" scene actually was compared to the memetic reputation it's had over the years.The overall narrative arc of the band makes sense and makes for a fine comedy, but I doubt I can see myself really rewatching this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

fair start for Guest,"After having just seen 'Best of Show,' I can see the many similarities in these two movies. Many of the same actors appear in each, the dialogue flows in the same way, and the comedy employs satire, visual humor and free association humor. 'Best of Show,' however, uses each of these facets superbly more efficaciously.For one, 'Spinal Tap' has no plot. The band goes on tour, it doesn't go well, so they get another tour. Yes, it is based on a true story; but I'm sure the real band had some conflict, tension, climax, and conclusion, in their careers. Some tension was even hinted at between David's wife and Nigel, but nothing comes of it. The David/Nigel conflict itself is under developed, as is the reunion.Also, the visual humor directed at the Tap wardrobe gets old fast. It's funny - for a few minutes - to see the 80's rock style with the long scrappy hair and loud hot pants. The same diminishing humor can be equated with the rock behavior during the concerts - concerning the spread eagles and facial contorsions.'Best of Show' gets past this decreasing utility by scripting a wide array of unique characters - showing that Guest had learned from his mistakes. Since 'Spinal Tap' cannot do this, other types of humor must be used to fill the void.The off the top of the head free association humor is what this crew does best. The ""11"" scene and the ""little bread"" scene are perfect examples. These amount to really to only enjoyable parts of the movie.Basically, this movie represents a nice early try and good attempt for Guest and company. His later films correct many of the lackings of 'Spinal Tap.' So it's good as a historical film for anyone interested in this cast.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Oldie moldy cult classic,"This is...not as funny as it once was, unfortunately. And frankly, considering all that has come to past in rock and roll, it seems a little tame, even a little on the lame side. Or perhaps I have grown too jaded. Since Rob Reiner dreamed up this ""pseudo-rockumentary"" (after affixing some gold paint strategically on the USS Coral Seas baseball cap he wears--one of the many sight gags in the movie) the satirical assault on rock culture as been done and done again, perhaps a time or two too many.The music itself is, shall we say, derivative with the Stones, some early Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Queen, and others having some distant unavoidable influence, while the unwashed antics of the stars both on stage and off have become clichÃ©s of the biz. Worse yet, satirizing the documentary mode itself has been done to death.Alas, can we have back those moments of splendor in the grass (Wordsworth) or when we first leaned back in the movie theater, the smell of rancid popcorn butter in our nose, and sticky soda corn syrup on the soles of our shoes, and got blasted away by Spinal Tap? No, Virginia, you can't go home again, sad to say.Might as well jump (Van Halen, 1984).(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

About the funniest movie ever made,"Even if you hate ""mock"" documentaries, even if you hate Rob Reiner, you owe it to yourself to see this movie, especially if you enjoy watching pomposity deflated.

Note to the uninitiated: ""Big Bottom"" is _not_ about bass drums.There isn't a scene in this film that doesn't absolutely slay me. I also have the soundtrack album, which has a featureless black cover (if you've seen the movie, you'll understand). Spinal Tap's ""comeback"" album and concert video from 1993, ""Break Like the Wind,"" is okay but not anywhere near as funny as the original.My favorite line from the film is uttered by David St. Hubbins:""It's such a fine line between stupid and clever.""Yes it is, David, but this film stays firmly on the clever side.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Must see cult film -- still has bite and humor.,"Trendy, well done ""rockumentary"" as director Rob Reiner interviews and accompanies former rave Spinal Tap, now an un-hip, dispirited British metal band on the last legs of a hardly formidable American tour, all the while seeing its audiences shrink and age, the gigs get progressively shaggier, and the whole thing grind to a near halt.This winning send-up of the rock world is, to be sure, much more hit than miss.  Christopher Guest, Michael McKean and Harry Shearer (also script and music co-writers, along with Reiner) have the time of their lives while giving right-on-the-mark perfs as the brain-fried band members who are suffering the usual indignities of a band slowly going down for the last count.  Hilarious squabblings over bad album covers, cheap set props, and poor management, along with informal comments on the direction of the band, their image, promo parties, and scheduling headaches get the full treatment, satirizing every cliche there is.  The boys themselves present riveting Jagger-like stances, attitudes and accents that go beyond real.  The backstage haps and ""concert"" footage, in particular have real bite.Favorite bits:  Guest and his 11-volume control amplifier, Fred Willard greeting a very unenthused band to his military base fete; Shearer getting pinned inside a futuristic prop piece; and McKean's all-out raunchy vocals.A cult favorite over the years, the cutting edge humor has dulled a bit, becoming more and more a time capsule piece as time goes by, but that alone is probably the best reason now to see it, just to find out what all the buzz was about when this first came out in 1984.Guest, of course, went on to create two other highly successful ""mockumentaries"" -- ""Waiting for Guffman"" and ""Best in Show.""",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Harry Shear seems to be man out  although it does fit the bass player mould.  David St. Hubbins (Michael Mckean is great and has some wonderful lines.

Would you believe that when Steven Tyler saw it the first time, he didn't get it either. this movie is a total rip on the glam bands that were forming during the late 70's early 80's, most particularly Kiss.

This Mockumentary-Rockumentary May Be Guest's Best Effort Poking Fun at Heavy Metal Rock Music Culture,"""This is Spinal Tap"" was Christopher Guest's first foray into so-called ""mockumentary"", a comedic genre in which satire and farce are presented in the form of a documentary film focusing on a fictional subject. One of the first of the genre was ""Take the Money and Run"" written, directed and starring Woody Allen. Spinal Tap is a fictional heavy metal rock band originating from Britain, a cross between ""The Who"", ""Alice Cooper"", ""Black Sabbath"", and ""Def Leppard"". The font used for the name on film posters and other media paraphernalia are similar to those used by many heavy metal bands popular during the late 1970's and 1980's, often of a neo-medieval/Gothic style. Rob Reiner, who directs, plays a fictional documentary/commercial filmmaker who presents a behind-the-scenes exposÃ© of a rock band whose loudness and punctuality are of legendary status.""This is Spinal Tap"" pokes fun at some of the ""rockumentaries"" which were in vogue in the 1980's, giving audiences and fans glimpses into the behind-the-scenes world of famous rock bands. This mockumentary-rockumentary lampoons such documentaries such as VH1's ""Behind the Music"" with a satirical harpoon large enough to catch the likes of Ozzie Osbourne, Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Joe Elliot and a host of other heavy metal musicians in one swoop. Marty Di Bergi, the fictional documentary filmmaker played by Rob Reiner gives a short introduction to the film dedicated to the band he first saw at a place called ""The Electric Banana"" in Greenwich Village during the 1960's, which, he explains doesn't exist any more. (If he didn't say that, you know some heavy metal groupies would be looking for it.)The film is a series of bits including interviews with groupies, fans, promoters, producers, and of course the band members. On-stage chicanery and behind-the-scenes mayhem become the cornerstone from which ""This is Spinal Tap"" emerges. Christopher Guest plays the lead guitarist Nigel ""Tuffy"" Tufnel, a Birmingham, England bloke with a heavy working-class cockney accent sporting a hairstyle like late Beatles and The Who. His character is a cross between Joe Elliott of Def Leppard, Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, and the late Randy Rhoades of Ozzy. David St. Hubbins played by Michael McKean, is the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of the band. His character seems to be based on David Lee Roth when he was lead singer for Van Halen and Steve Clark, rhythm guitarist of Def Leppard. A short clip of the band's ""early years"" in black and white out-of-focus video with the band in bland suits and jackets with the trademark elevated drummer sets the stage for much of the silliness which follows. Only two bands which continued from the 1960's and into the 1980's which could have looked like that and play the kind of heavy metal in vogue in the 1980's would be The Who and maybe The Rolling Stones. The bands they lampoon largely came into existence during the 1970's.Many of the bits are actually not as over-the-top as you might believe because of the chaos which haunts heavy metal musicians, both in terms of off-stage buffoonery and on-stage antics. In one memorable bit, the band is singing their newly-composed hit ""Stonehenge"" and a replica of one of the stones is lowered onstage--but it's not quite as dramatic as it should be! Another is when Guest shows Reiner his collection of guitars and amps. All amps in the industry go up to a maximum of 10 in terms of volume, but Spinal Tap's amps go up to 11! ""That's '1' louder!"" proclaims Guest.If you know anything about the heavy metal and pop music scene and would like a no-holds-barred satire about that Alice-in-Wonderland world, this is definitely for you. By the mid-to-late 1970's heavy metal rock bands, spear-headed by the likes of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath garnered huge followings in Europe and North America. They became so-called ""super-groups"" and were the voices of late Boomers and early Generation X'ers who enjoyed wearing black and other non-conformist clothing, riding motorcycles and taking recreational drugs. They were in a sense the next evolution in rebellious youth making the hippies of a half-generation earlier seem tame by comparison. ""This is Spinal Tap"" pokes fun at this world but not in a disparaging way. However, if you believe these people should be placed on pedestals and worshipped like Gods, ""This is Spinal Tap"" might bring you up from your knees. In a real-life story, Ozzy Osbourne was once asked about his house burning down. He replied he wanted to know if beer was flammable! And yes it is! This could have been a scene in ""This is Spinal Tap"" but actually it wasn't!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

It must have been a huge risk to assume people would go along with the premise in the first place, then get the satire and irony that make it so funny. Humor changes a lot over the years, but this is a movie that it not going away anytime soon. Lastly, the musical numbers are actually very catchy and clever.

If you are older then the age of 25 and still have not seen ""This is Spinal Tap"" then I suggest you head to the nearest rental store and rent this because you do no know what you have been missing.Marti DeBergi (Rob Reiner) is most famous for making dog food and other type of commercials. He then decides to take a break from commercials to film a documentary, or rockumentary, on the band, Spinal Tap (a band that was created for this movie). This resulting rockumentary follows Spinal Tap as they make a comeback tour in America, following the band around on their fateful tour. This is the kind of tour where everything happens, and a lot of things goes wrong....several gigs gets called off, problems with their stage-show, conflicts between the members of the band, and so on. This showed the good and bad days of Spinal Tap and their many drummers.First off, because of this movie, a major part of life is now completed. With all of the pop culture references of today, I can now say that I understand where the jokes came from. From now on, when I listen to a radio station and I hear a ""This is Spinal Tap"" reference I will understand it. In fact, not only can I understand references but also I can make them myself.This is Rob Reiner's film directorial debut and it is wonderful for a debut. With the combination of Rob Reiner directorial style and the writings of McKean, Guest, and Shearer, this is brilliant satire. Michael McKean as David St. Hubbins, Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel, and Harry Shearer as Derek Smalls were wonderful as members of Spinal Tap. They were so convincing it is hard to realize that Spinal Tap was not a real band. This movie had so many classic scenes/lines, which I will not spoil for you; it would be hard to dislike this. There are even memorable cameo appearances by Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, Fran Drescher, and Fred Willard.In conclusion, ""This is Spinal Tap"" is probably the funniest rock and roll comedies that I have seen. It is a shame this was not perceived well in theaters, but that is what makes this a cult. This certainly will receive repeat viewings from me and I do believe that I will not forget this movie in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good, but not nearly as good as Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show or A Mighty Wind","A decent, sort of funny documentary, rockumentary, mockumentary, whatever you wish to call it. People who started off with Guffman, Show or even A Mighty Wind will be sorely disappointed as it is not nearly as funny or smart as these, but still worth the four or five really good moments in the movie. Geez, I heard it was classic and thought it would be better than the new movies... Wasted all that money.... This is one to rent, not buy.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
I give this movie an 11/11,"I am shocked to learn that people older than me have not seen this movie, which came out before I was even born. ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is great on so many levels. For one, it deserves props for popularizing the genre of ""mockumentaries"" (or ""mock"" documentaries). Secondly, it is hands down the best satire on rock-'n'-roll AND the best mockumentary. Sure, there have been other decent mockumentaries and rock comedies; however, the film's brilliance remains unparalleled. Moreover, it is not nasty in its indictment of rock bands. As opposed to completely scorning its topic, it simply points out the foibles of rock-'n'-roll, such as how drumming can be a deadly job.The film, furthermore, is full of unforgettable moments as well as brilliant performances by members of the fictional band Spinal Tap--- Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer. As with the later Guest-penned mockumentaries (which I also love), much of the film is improvised. However, even the premeditated material is golden. Examples are the band's catchy songs that sound eerily authentic or smaller details such as critical reviews of Spinal Tap albums.This film may be over a quarter of a century old, yet it will be relevant for years to come. Now that the 1980s are long gone, we can see the ridiculousness of all those hair bands. The fact that the creators of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" had this insight at that time makes the film all the more ingenuous.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Reiner ""Taps"" Into Something Special","An aging, fading British rock group is touring America, and on hand to document the occasion is a filmmaker who has been blown away by their sound since the first time he heard them; and the result is offered up here for the perusal of all, in `This Is Spinal Tap,' without question the best feature length parody of a rock band ever made, directed by Rob Reiner. When the band returns to the U.S. to promote their latest album, `Smell The Glove,' director Marty DiBergi (Reiner)  accompanies them on tour, conducting interviews and taping performances, in an effort to get it all down for posterity.  And get it all he does; the highs and lows, the drama and pathos, the words, wisdom and witticisms of this legendary rock group. It's all here, and we owe it all to a man of incredible intuition, imagination and foresight, Marty DiBergi.  But, with all seriousness aside, folks... 	When this film was released in 1984, it was fresh and new, cutting edge satire that seemed almost outrageous and scathingly intemperate; and to some extent, it still does today.  The difference now, however, is that the times have caught up to and surpassed the parody of the movie.  By anyone's standards, much of this film now seems quite tame, though the subject of the satire remains every bit as relevant today as it did then.  The interviews, conducted and delivered with such dry humor and subtle wit, readily withstand the test of time and are as funny now as ever; but the songs, especially the lyrics, pale now somewhat in the wake of such acts as Marilyn Manson, Rob Zombie, Slipknot, Monster Magnet, System Of A Down, Coal Chamber, Pantera and Alice In Chains (just to mention a few), all of whom in reality have gone far beyond the parameters set by Spinal Tap.  And with today's accessibility to such a wide variety of groups and music via MTV, MTVX, VH-1 and all the other myriad cable connections, it's simply taken the `sting' out of the impact of the film.  Like science fiction that has become science fact, our culture and society has contextually changed it's frame of reference, which of course must change the way we perceive a film like `Spinal Tap.' 	What can never change is the quality of the overall movie, the precision of the satire, and the caliber of the performances and direction.  With genuine sincerity, Reiner/DiBergi delivers a truly believable `Rockumentary.'  His pace and timing are impeccable, and his eye for detail is thorough (though much of it will be lost on today's generation).  The performances are first rate all around:  Michael McKean, totally credible as David St. Hubbins (lead guitar, vocals), possibly the best character he's ever done; Christopher Guest as Nigel Tufnel (lead guitar, vocals); Harry Shearer as Derek Smalls (bass, vocals); and, of course Reiner, who'is' DeBergi.  Also turning in notable performances are Bruno Kirby (Tommy Pischedda), R.J. Parnell (Mick Shrimpton, drummer), David Kaff (Viv Savage, keyboards, vocals), Tony Hendra (Ian Faith), Fran Drescher (Bobbi Flekman), and Patrick Macnee (Sir Denis Eaton-Hogg).  Though it may have lost some of it's edge due to changing times, `This Is Spinal Tap' will forever remain a milestone in cinematic history.  The songs may be dated but the humor is timeless; this is top-notch satire, and the parody set the standard in the rock genre for those who followed, like Weird Al Yankovic.  The appeal of this film is going to vary from generation to generation, and it follows that the level of appreciation is going to vary; but the fact will always remain that this is a unique movie that succinctly captures the spirit and essence of an entire era.  And for that, Reiner and Co. get a tip of the hat.  I rate this one 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Making a big thing of it would have been a good idea!,Anybody who does not find this film funny is clearly a loser. This rockumentary is hilarious in everything that it does whether it is the classic lines or the band getting lost on the way to the stage.If you did not find this film funny or thought it was crap you obviously missed the subtle humour so you must watch it again!!!

This is a great film,"The word 'cult' was pretty much invented for 'This is Spinal Tap.' It's hard to say who the target audience is, but it's fair to say that whoever it is, it's a 'niche' group. 'Mockumentaries' are commonplace these days in both film and TV, but back in 1984, they were a lot rarer. Here, we have a (fake) fly-on-the-wall documentary about Britain's loudest rock band 'Spinal Tap' as they release a new album and try to tour America at the same time.The best thing about the film is that it never openly makes fun of its subject matter. The band may be made up of self-absorbed, egotistical, long-haired idiots, but, the strange thing is, you actually care about them. They're hardly the brightest bunch and their lack of intelligence does mean that we â€“ the audience â€“ do feel superior (and even sorry on some occasions) for them when things go wrong. And they frequently go wrong.Spinal Tap may be Britain's 'loudest' group, but their star is fading and the tour is not as 'sell out' as they'd like it to be. Sometimes it's actually quite sad watching them as they desperately try to hang onto the life they were once used to.Like I said at the beginning, it's hard to know who the 'target audience' for This Is Spinal Tap' really is. The comedy is more subtle than your average 'laugh-a-minute-fest' and you need to have an appreciation for both mockumentaries and also darker, black humour. Plus a love of heavy metal and/or rock music should help.Many films don't age well. At least this one has bad haircuts that were as bad at the time of filming as they are today! Also, special mention to Michael Mckean, who puts on a great British accent like he's a native.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the funniest comedies ever made. And that's the truth!,"How many times has this happened to you: You hear and you read endless amounts of praise about an old film which is considered a classic in its genre, and for some reason you've never had a chance to see it, and then when you get round to watching it, even if it's reasonably good, it dissapoints you, because it just can't live up to all those years of hype you've been exposed to.This has certainly happened to me with lots of films, and, as I went into the cinema to see Spinal Tap for the first time, in its recent UK re-release, I feared it would happen again. For years I had been reading article after article after review invariably claiming this film to be one of the most hilarious ever made, a masterpiece of comedy, and of course I was dying to see it; but I was sure that if I saw it expecting ""one of the funniest comedies ever"" (and there was no way I could avoid that), it would not measure up, no way, and I would be sadly disappointed... againThe wonderful thing was that I wasn't, not at all: That's how good Spinal Tap is. It took for me a little while to get into the dynamic of it, but when Nigel started having problems with the size of the bread I just began to laugh out loud and I hardly stopped throughout the film, I couldn't help myself. The astounding creativity and wit of the cast and director, coming up with those scenes and those lines most of the time by improvising, never ceases to amaze me. And the characters were instantly lovable and memorable, despite (or, more precisely, because of) their abysmal stupidity. I just couldn't get enough of them, and the film, though it is actually quite short, seemed CRIMINALLY short to me when the credits started rolling.In a few months I have gone from being a Spinal Tap ignoramus to a die hard fan, and a viewing of the DVD satiated my hunger for more with a glorious extra hour of outtakes which are just as funny as what Reiner (sorry, Di Bergi) left in. How could I live for so many years not having seen it? I just don't know.So if you still haven't seen it, all I can say is that you really don't know what you're missing. Improve your life: watch Spinal Tap.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
There's a fine line between stupid and clever,"The mockumentary is by this point a well-established genre, but today's faux-docs (often in the form of TV series like The Office) can often seem like ordinary scripted comedy where the characters occasionally talks to the camera. This is Spinal Tap, the film that really popularized the sub-genre, goes to great lengths to mimic and parody the documentary form: quick cuts, nonsensical asides, an awkward director occasionally stumbling on camera, no real narrative direction until the final act, and a lot of ugly people struggling to say something meaningful.Of course, the main thing that makes This is Spinal Tap a classic is that it's incredibly funny. The good-natured but dim musicians of the titular band are less a parody of rock stars than an absurd band of characters thrust into semi-fame. The band's fictional history, complete with flower-child flashbacks and a long line of dead drummers, is the richest vein of comedy. A few of the movie's gags have been overexposed through endless repetition (call it Monty Python syndrome), but there's a lot of clever comedy that still resonates. Reiner and screenwriter Christopher Guest are capable of both broad, goofy comedy and understated bits that only the attentive will catch.There are probably some points on which you could critique This is Spinal Tap -- the characters are hard to distinguish until about halfway through, and there is the above-mentioned lack of narrative -- but the whole picture is so shaggily charming that it's hard not to smile and laugh along. If you haven't seen this, it may be the best use of 80 minutes of your time around.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"An interesting film, but not the 'classic' its touted as being","In the year 1982, filmmaker and super fan Marty DiBergi decides to make a film on legendary English heavy metal band Spinal Tap on what is to be their US comeback tour. Will Spinal Tap be able to replicate their earlier success or will this US tour prove to be their last hoorah?This is a film that I've wanted to see for so long, but it was so rarely on TV that I never managed to catch it. Recently it was on BBC2 so I decided to give it a go and my feelings on the film are rather mixed...To start with the good; I thought the film was very well made and as host and filmmaker I thought Rob Reiner did a very good job - it's rare that you see him in front of the camera, but as it turns out unlike some directors he's not a bad actor. I also felt that the film offered a decent insight into life in a band and life on the road so to speak; although it's clearly an exaggeration and a spoof of rock bands and the rock band scene it all comes across quite convincingly and believable. I could well believe that musicians, managers, promoters etc would have some of the squabbles and issues that are depicted in the film. In fact, this is where the film is at its best; the backstage stuff, the interviews and so on are the more interesting aspects of the film. There were a couple of funny moments such as the artificial limb scene at the airport and the stonehenge debacle.The downside of the film for me lay with some of the characters; although some of what they say and do can be of interest they're all a bit thinly drawn and many claim that this film is an hilarious spoof of the rock n roll scene. Personally I would categorise this film as being a mildly amusing film, but certainly not a laugh out loud spoof. I also hoped I'd get more from the actual music side of the film, but even the songs weren't all that memorable - then again as its meant to be a spoof maybe that was the point.Although the main stars did a solid job I just wish that they'd have had a bit more about them; when watching films I like characters with something about them, somebody who you can understand, identify with and I just didn't get much of that here.This is Spinal Tap is an interesting insight into the rock n roll music scene (albeit an exaggerated offering) and for this reason it is worth seeing - particularly if you are a fan of the genre of music which is being spoofed. However, its best to keep your expectations low and ignore all the hype surrounding the film. That way, at least, you should find the film to be moderately enjoyable.FUN FACT; this film is apparently the only film on IMDB to have a rating out of 11.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The votes go up to 11......,"This Is Spinal Tap is brilliant on several levels.  It is a hilarious comedy, the music is excellent, the concept is fantastic, and it is a wonderfully accurate spoof as well.The preparation which went into this film included going on tour with the band Saxon, which allegedly inspired the superb sequence where the band gets lost backstage on tour.  Although Status Quo claim the film was based on them, it was from the Saxon tour that much of the detail was taken.The characters, though, are quintessentially British.  David St. Hubbins, Nigel Tufnel (whose amplifiers go up to 11 instead of the usual 10) and Derek Smalls are archetypes of faded British rock musicians desperately trying to be cosmopolitan in an industry dominated by bigger, bolder, louder Americans.If you are a rock fan you will laugh long and loud at this film.  If you are a British rock fan, you will laugh even louder.  And watch out for the surreal Stonehenge sequence, which proves once and for all that standards of arithmetic teaching are not what they were....",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Enough of my yapping, let's boogie!","Rob Reiner gave birth of the mockumentary in 1984 with his ad lib musical trio of Christopher Guest, Michael McKean & Harry Shearer. Rock 'n Roll ridiculous is panned in Rolling Stone English from album concepts to stage props and all paraphernalia in between. When David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel spew out such idioms as ""It's such a fine line between clever and stupid"" you know that their clichÃ©'d world is as flawed as their amplifiers that go to eleven. Their stage and interview performances are infectious and their timing is still fresh, decades later and became a new art form into itself. Spinal tap is a mish-mash of music industry persona's attached to an aging heavy metal band. There are wonderfully uncomfortable cameos everywhere to nibble at while the main course focuses on our English trio sadly pretending to be hip and relevant. The oft-quote dialog seals this spot with their brilliantly original and spot on non-stop heavy metal parody.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious!,"This film is easily in my top 25 of all time, easily. This film is basically about a ""mocumentary"" about the average 80's loud monster ballad bands. Theres the horrible lyrics, the hair, the drugs, heck theres everything that described the 80's ballad bands.Pros: Absoultely hilarious. Very witty funny. The actors wrote their own lyrics and sang thier own songs which i'm very impressed by. Great story that actually made sense. Great acting, it made you feel like it was a real doucmentary. Each character is richly created throughout the movie and has a very memorable cast. Had the ""documentary style cenimatography"" which made it even more hilarious.Cons:If your a fan of the 80's bands (ie Van Halen, Def Leppard) you may not like this movie. Wish they had gotten in more depth with the Keyboardist. I think that character coulda been really funny. Thats pretty much all the cons.DVD (special edition): Great for it's price of 20 dollars. Comes with director commmentary along with the cast. Outakes, 4 music videos. Tons of extra footage. This is a DVD that gives a bang for your buck.Overall: Very funny movie, should be watched with a group of friends. The Pros far outwiegh the cons and this is a film you should pickup if you havn't seen it already.-=FINAL VERDICT=- 9 /10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A true masterpiece,"A recent rewatching of one of my favorite films, ""This is Spinal Tap,"" after several years without seeing it, impressed upon me what a truly remarkable work it is.  While the latter-day Christopher Guest mockumentaries are great achievements unto themselves, make no mistake: the granddaddy (guided masterfully by Rob Reiner) is still the undisputed king of this smart, quirky brand of humor.Michael McKean and Guest are so tremendously sharp, so subtle yet so larger-than-life as the quintessential John-Paul/Mick-Keith duo of David and Nigel that the film COULD float along on their energy and tension alone. But this film has performance to burn--with Harry Shearer's dorky bassist Derek, Tony Hendra's pugnacious and believable manager Ian (the great forgotten performance of this film--you'd be surprised how many of the memorable moments revolve around Ian), June Chadwick's unspeakably pretentious Yoko-girlfriend Jeanine, and, of course, Reiner as supreme lamo documentarian Marti DiBergi.This isn't even to mention a series of inspired cameos by Billy Crystal, Paul Shaeffer, and Fran Drescher, among others (look for more of all of them in the extensive deleted scenes, which are a real joy unto themselves).Then there's the music.  Tap improbably spans the generations, from early Beatles/Stones Buddy Holly tribute rock to hippy-dippy psychedelia to adolescent sex metal (in a sense, the decline of Tap is the decline of rock 'n' roll itself).  The songs and musicianship are so stunningly good (even when corny, it's all so extraordinarily well done), which is an excellent example of what makes this film truly great: it recognizes that parody is no excuse for laziness.Hence the high standards of musicianship.  Hence the cleverly crafted songs that you almost expect to hear when you turn on the radio.  Hence the razor-sharp performances and unforgettable characters and relationships. Hence the compelling story, which is at more than one point sadder than it is funny.As it always does, ""Spinal Tap"" faded to black (a kind of pastel black) the other night after a blazingly quick and tight 82 minutes.  My friend, who had never seen it before, was mightily impressed.  But not as impressed as yours truly, who was probably watching it for the 12th or 13th time.It's time to stop calling Spinal Tap one of the greatest comedies of all time, one of the greatest mockumentaries of all time, one of the greatest rock 'n' roll films of all time.  The simple fact is, this is one of the greatest movies ever made, period.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
DO NOT believe the hype,"WOW. Just wow. Hard to even begin. I'm a HUGE Christopher Guest fan. I have seen all of his movies multiple times and own most of them. Best in Show, Waiting for Guffman, Mighty Wind, etc. All of these and many more Guest movies are masterpieces. But Spinal Tap? Wow. I saw it in 1985 a year after it came out. To watch it again, I gathered several film buffs I watch movies with. Many are Guest fans also. I also brought in the family. Spinal Tap is the following: stupid, poorly written, replete with horrible timing, full of unnecessarily foul language and highly unentertaining. It is also very, very slow. Here's how it tries to get laughs: One of the characters is dressed in some funny way (big suspenders, etc) and says something unexpected. Then there is an edited pause. You're supposed to fill in the pause with raucous laughter. Except its not funny. So there's just silence. Long pauses where we all looked at each other. Every person watching at one point said out loud, ""Was that supposed to be funny? It was stupid"" and that is the absolute best way to sum up this overhyped, lazy, boring, crass, unfunny movie. Watch ANYTHING else by Guest. My favorite is Best in Show but there are many great choices.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
The only negative to this movie...,"...is that people mistake it for being an accurate reflection of an entire genre. In its purest form, British doom metal was actually concieved as a form of rebellion against an agonisingly empty and desperate existence in a city that still had bomb damage left over from World War II. Similarly, Norwegian black metal was concieved as a form of rebellion against a Christian government that had stripped the country of its rightful heritage. So no, neither art form (and those are they only basic true forms of the music that plastic bands of the 1980s like Poison et al were trying to imitate) is as childish or asinine as this mockumentary wishes they were. They both are marked by strong social, political, and psychological messages that ring very true even thirty years after the first album of the elder genre came out.As a sendup of the lame, plastic, tryhard imitations that the major record labels of the 1980s flooded the market with in a cheap attempt to weaken the legacy set by Black Sabbath in the 1970s (and still admirably held up by such bands as Cathedral and My DyING BRIDE), however, Spinal Tap is impeccable. In fact, one can argue that the message of This Is Spinal Tap is to remain true to yourself. Spinal Tap are obviously a clone of all those bands out there that were created in order to fill a booming market, and the film shows what happened to the 'Tap when the fickle tastes of the market changed, leaving them out in the cold. In that sense, it was well ahead of its time, as the market for soft, poppy versions of what Napalm Death and Cathedral did so well during the mid 1980s and early 1990s (respectively) didn't actually dry up for another six or seven years after the film's release. Excellent foresight.Another myth that this film puts forward is that a band will sound the same regardless of who is drumming. Anyone who's heard the difference between the My DyING BRIDE albums of 1991-1996 and then heard the two that were released in 1998 and 1999 will tell you this is far from the case. While it is hard to distinguish oneself on the drums, those who achieve it are all the more notable for doing so. But one thing I like about this film is how it illustrates one truth: the more effort a band puts into posing, the more plain and ordinary their music generally sounds.So if you're searching for an accurate reflection of a musical genre, then skip this film and grab the remastered version of Black Sabbath's ""Paranoid"" album instead. But if you want to laugh yourself senseless at some jokes about poser stupidity and some hilarious references (one guitarist's voice is identical to a manager's from Led Zeppelin's ""Song Remains The Same"" movie), then this is the film for you.",,Anonymous,Music
A classic fake Rock-Doco deserving of it's cult status,"This is Spinal Tap is so entrenched into popular and movie culture that it feels like there is nothing new to say about this joyous and quite frankly awesome mocumentary that without a doubt would be more true to the facts that many would care to pay mention to. What can be said about Spinal Tap is if you have not yet partaken in its journey to the depths of a band keeping it's head barely above water seek it out today.Doing things previously un-thought of the team behind Spinal Tap fully inhabited there over the top characters to the point of many not actually knowing if the men clad in tight spandex and flowing hair were in fact real or fake. The length the group went to to inhabit these characters is not dissimilar to a Sacha Baron Coen effort of actually melting into their creation and becoming the character. Look no further than Nigel Tufnel (played fantastically by future director Guest) showing off his guitar and amp collection or one single look at Derek Smalls beard for proof of this. These fantastic and committed performances would be nothing however if the Spinal Tap band were not ready to rock your socks off.Spinal Tap features many a performance by the band each offering up a raucous and energetic rendition of their hit songs from ""Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight"" through to ""Big Bottom"", these gig set pieces are highlights of the film from the fantastically staged ""Pod"" appearance, the Stonehenge money shot or the bands playing of an Army Airbase with air traffic control interference all are laugh out loud funny moments and give the film a vibe that cannot be faked. The film also however reveals in smaller moments from band manager Ian's obsession with having a cricket bat or a party catered for by waiters dressed as mimes (spot the Billy Crystal cameo here), these are but a few examples of the film working on many different comedic levels.Holding firm today with its reputation as one of the all-time funniest movies, This is Spinal Tap will forever be a career peak for all involved. Grab yourself a Hi-Def remastering, crank the sound up to 11 and enjoy the 80 minute ride with a band that is always ready to rock, no matter what the interference.4 undersized stage props out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Brilliant. Hilarious. Must have some brains to get all the jokes,"It's funny to read the few comments here such as those saying that ""School of Rock"" was a great film about Rock and Roll. That pretty much sums up the limits of some of the viewers, unfortunately.This film is about a genre in Rock and Roll. If you lived through the 70s, 80s or even the early 90s as a teenager or adult, you can related to the perfect satire of this genre. Many of the jokes are so funny and have some basis in a little bit of what makes people well rounded that they may fly right over the head of younger viewers (""I prize the rent from the local Hebrews."")Without a doubt, if you're a musician you will love this film. If you're not a musician you might not get all the jokes but it is still a hilarious, fun ride. It takes you through everything from the political correctness that is ""the entertainment industry"" to the image conscious era of 60s/70s rock bands where sexuality reigned supreme.So my guess is that if you're a younger viewer or not at all into the music scene, you may not fully relate. Regardless, this is the movie that started all the mockumentaries and for good reason. The performances are stellar - the actors ARE the band.I enjoyed this film and remember all the lines just because it defined so many great inside jokes of what was. Every cut is hit on this soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Heavy Metal Fools,"Part of what makes comedy great is that it is truthfulness but in a comical and exaggerated tone, which makes it both relatable but also joyful at the same time to take in. This is not just one of my favorite comedies but also one of my favorite films in general. I remember when I was a kid I actually thought this was a real heavy metal rock band, though the fake band did have a few albums and do some real tours for a while if you can believe that.This is my favorite film from Rob Reiner, it was the first film or at least one of the first films that created the comedy subgenere mockumentry which didn't entirely caught on till at lot latter with TV shows like ""The Office (UK and US versions)"", ""Parks and Recretation"", and ""Reno 911"". To me this was a brilliant idea the combo of both the comedy and documentary genre, the beauty of this is how in a way it's sort of a blurring the line with both reality and non reality, but also a way of simply keeping comedy along with comedic characters within reality.The film parodies but also homages and a bit of a love letter to the music scene, from the heavy metal bands but most notably ""The Bettles"". The cinematography is great it's pretty much the documentary style, it really felt like we weren't watching a movie so much but an actually documentary, it really almost looked as though this band might have existed. The music is great, it's memorable, fun and actually funny when you think about the content.But of course the three Spinal Tap band members are just fraking hilarious, all three of them are practically dorks and well fools but in a good way. They pretty much like kids or teenagers that dress up cool and try to act cool and yet they aren't. The band isn't really that good at what they do; even though their songs are fun, in the real life Heavy Metal world I wouldn't exactly call them slammin classics. My favorite song is ""Hellhole"" if you listen to the whole song or seen the music video on it, it is one big contradiction as if the person who wrote it might have changed his mind while he wrote part of the middle and end of the song, or someone else stepped in and wrote those parts at the last minute.All three mainly Nigel and David can be a bit childish sometimes like in one scene that cracks me up was when Nigel complains about having finger food bread instead of full sliced bread because he simply can't fold a piece; did it ever occur to him to simply stop at a grocery store and buy a loaf.Yet you really like all three band members and even care about them because their hearts are in the right place, if not their heads. These are people that have a dream/s but most importantly just want to do what they love play music.Even like the manager Ian, whom is dryly hilarious. I really like how gruff he really is and just how much grief he sometimes receives from the band as he is trying to coop with what demands some of them have and making things work despite rolling his eyes a bit in the process. This is an easy attitude to emphasize with if you ever were a manager and there was an amount of chaos or uncoroporation you had to deal with. I even like the fact that he has a cricket bat which despite random I thought was a funny quark to him, he uses it as a way to remind him of his roots and also vent some frustration.The dialog the characters have along with Ian is great, this film just so rich in verbal humor that you would have to see more than once to uncover more. Even some of the visual humor is great, my favorite was seeing the cover art of each of their albums which is deliciously bad and I feel a beautiful combo of both visual and verbal humor together.What I also like is that there is some truth in the film, from little things like a scene where the band gets lost trying to find the main stage which is true, it would really help if those back auditoriums had a visual directory because their real big and easy to get lost in. Even that worst fear all bands and performers carry, on things going wrong we see actually do for Spinal Tap, like the Stonehenge concert which well lets just say made, rock history.Spinal Tap rocks, well sort of.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Music
This Goes To Eleven!!,"What a feast! What a marvelous little parody of a movie. Great work, great casting, great songs, great band members, hilarious moments, excellent dialogs, crazy jokes, real life situations - every little thing here is awesome. I am a rock drummer myself and I loved every second of this great parody. Why, this is a true thing - many bands have fallen victims of similar misadventures - lost backstage, lost with props, lost with song list, lost with band members changes, lost with sound, lost with managers, lost with sense of humor. And the immortal These go to eleven moment is simply The Top. As well as the famous cocoon section with poor bassist trapped inside. Very funny, very wild and riveting. The songs are highly competent, too, and the psychedelic gem Flower People is great in its own right. This is a movie that deserves a high praise and real prize - love of film fans.

Comedy at its finest,"The spoof ""This is Spinal Tap"" displays the true reality of a rock n' roll life style. As a filmmaker follows the fictional band Spinal Tap through out the film you see every component that goes into becoming and maintaining a rock n' roll image. Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins), Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel) and Harry Shearer (Derek Smalls) do a great job portraying the British rock band that is Spinal Tap. Rob Reiner's is the filmmaker following Spinal Tap during their disastrous comeback tour to the United States, which proves some things are best left in the past.The film goes through the events as if you are truly watching a documentary. The band members are serious as they debate over album covers and band member's girlfriends. The way Reiner uses lighting during the concerts to emphasis the bulges in the bands pants will have you on the floor laughing. The dialog alone will have you repeating this movie again and again. Nigel's complete lack of common sense keeps you laughing from beginning to end. The scene where Nigel is trying to figure out how to fit the lunchmeat on ""tiny"" bread is hilarious and as they explain why their amplifier goes up to eleven you have to wonder to yourself if this is truly the conversation that happen backstage before a show.This film is comedy at its finest it doesn't make you look for an alternative meaning or depth it is just good old comedy similar to Wayne's World. If you loved the 80's with this its big hair, tight jeans, and power ballads that examine the female body ""This is Spinal Tap"" is the movie for you. Turn your TV up to 11 and enjoy!",,Anonymous,Music
This is Hilarious,"This is an inspired rockumentary or mockumentary about legendary British heavy metal band Spinal Tap trying to make a comeback on an American tour. It is such an audacious directorial debut for Reiner, who also plays a filmmaker documenting the comeback tour, that he has yet to make a better film. It's brimming with hilarious moments (interviews, song lyrics, stage performances, internal squabbles). What really makes it work is that McKean, Guest, and Shearer look totally believable as band members. Highlights include the rant about miniature sandwiches, the Stonehenge fiasco, the band unable to find the stage in Cleveland, and the amp that goes to 11.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Satire of the 1970s.1980s Metal Scene,"I'm not going to write a real review for this film because it's just so classic, having received numerous honors. Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean made their careers on this film. Rob Reiner might have gotten by with ""Spinal Tap"" (he had, for example, ""The Princess Bride"" a few years later)...And we also have very early appearances from Fred Willard, Fran Drescher, and Dana Carvey. Who would expect to see the three of them in one film? It took almost twenty years for Willard to really take off. Unfortunately, Bily Crystal also makes an appearance... the same mistake Reiner made in ""Princess Bride"". Sorry, Rob, that's just not right.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The greatest Moc-umentary of all time,"Reiner took a chance with McKean and Guest to produce a ""movie"" that had never been made before. The idea was not only different but took a lot of people to convince it could work. One by one, actors came out to support the film by doing cameos. Billy Crystal, Paul Schaffer, and several other SNL connected stars came out to add their own touch of genius to the project. In the end, you get proof that McKean and Guest are two of the most under appreciated actors / writers of the 80's and 90's. Their fresh brand of comedy has produced some of the most funniest moments in movies and television. This is Spinal Tap remains one of the most original and creative films ever produced in the comedy genre. 20 years later, the film has gained a giant following of devoted fans and comedy writers who have tried to steal from its uniqueness.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Smug and unfunny,"Rocumentary about the fictious British heavy metal band called Spinal Tap. The members are played by Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer. They go to Ameria to promote their new album with a tour. The tour ends up being a disaster. Filming them is filmmaker Marty DiBergi (Rob Reiner) for a documentary.The acting is good with a great supporting cast (Fran Drescher is hysterical) and it moves fairly quick and is short (about 90 minutes). However the film isn't funny and full of unpleasant characters. Also the songs are just terrible. Worst of all is there is an air of smugness over the film that is very annoying.

If you are a person who was a youth during the '70's & '80's as I was you will recognize the type of band these guys represent.

"Biting satire, brilliant execution, but not that funny","This is Spinal Tap is a modern cinematic masterpiece, but it's not that funny.  If you know nothing of the subject matter then you'll sit stone faced through it.  I've put this to the test, using relatives who know nothing about rock music, and found it to be true.  I think all the people who consider it to be the funniest film of all time are sadly deluding it and themselves.This is Spinal Tap is, however, a true bona fide modern day classic.The script seems episodic and rambling but is actually fairly tightly plotted.  The actors should have all been up for Academy Awards.  Their accents were spot on.  Many British people, myself included, find American actors trying British accents to be one of the most hilarious things imaginable.  Most American actresses tend to think all British women talk like the Queen and most American men seem to end up somewhere between Hugh Grant and a bad Mick Jagger.  These actors kept their accents good and strong for the whole film.  These elements and the brilliant idea of giving the whole film a documentary feel - including some obviously improvised dialogue - propel this film to a status above all satires.This is Spinal Tap is, certainly, one of the best films ever made and also very influential - if This is Spinal Tap never happened then I think we'd have never had the Larry Sanders Show - But for shear comedic value it's not as funny as say the Preston Sturges/Howard Hawks screwball comedies of the 30's and 40's, the insane gag a minute films like Airplane; Something about Mary; American Pie or Showgirls.",,Anonymous,Music

"Overhyped, outdated, slow","As a fan of rock and metal music, sooner or later you ought to stumble upon numerous references to this movie. Hence it has been on my ""to watch"" list for over a decade at this point, and I have finally found a way to watch it. Full disclosure I have seen bits and klips from the movie already, the best punchlines are honestly difficult to avoid. The sad thing is, that the rest of the movie doesn't offer that much more. The best punchlines had become memes at this point, and there wasn't left any more funny stuff for the runtime, so I found it tediously slow and unfunny, boring even. Perhaps part of the reason is, that I never cared much for rock music and hair metal. The 70-80 popular bands were at best a gateway towards other subgenres and thus watching a documentary mocking the culture around such bands didn't resonate with me that much. I feel like timeless comedies should indeed be timeless. Monty python and the holy grail is an older movie, yet is just as hilarious as it was decades ago. With Spinal Tap however the humor is expecting the audience to be of some background in order to work. Since it does have a cult following that apparently loves this movie 11/10, you might be amongst the people who will also love it. Surely the movie is worth at least one watch, but there is a pretty good chance IMO, that the movie will bore and dissapoint you as it did me.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

It's One Louder,"I wonder if the actors playing Nigel Tufnel, Derek Smalls and David St. Hubbins wandered the set without ever breaking character.  Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean become their hard-rocking alter-egos for the documentary of a ficticious rock band.  They know their characters so well, that they even do performances and interviews (NPR's ""All Things Considered"" had a good one) as these characters.The movie features expected and unexpected cameos from Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey (a non-speaking mime), Fred Willard and Paul Schaffer in a story that spoofs every silly aspect of the rock star life.  It's so funny because it closely parallels the quirks of rock star lifestyle (as seen on TV, since I've never been one) and performances.  From the petty backstage gripes; such as improperly sized bread and bologna, to the grand failure of a melodramatic creative vision.  It takes all the crap you see on a ""VH1 Behind The Music"" and makes fun of it.The songs are hilarious, and the memorable lines will be quoted from now to eternity.I'd also reccomend ""Waiting For Guffman"" (a similar tale revolving around community theater in the fictional town of Blaine, MO) and ""Best in Show"". Both of these feature Fred Willard, who is hilarious, in a more visible role.  There's also a great Saturday Night Live skit you can probably find on any SNL Sports special.  It features Martin Short, Harry Shearer and Christopher Guest in the quest for a men's olympic synchronized swimming competition.But I digress...When I first saw Spinal Tap it took a day or two for me to realize how hilarious it was.

One of the most Amazing Hard Band Bios,"When I first saw ""Tap"" on television as a young lad I was blown away by the candid nature of this 'Rockumentary that goes places others simply avoid.

The list goes on and on and on - as far as the review can see. The Stonehenge debacle influenced the Block Sobboth to attempt a similar stunt with even worse results. The Isle of Luci festival was one of the most important in rock history and Spinal Tap was not only there - but they stole the show! To display the versatility of the brilliant band members: The 2 lead-singer-songwriters St. Hubbins/Tufnel have gone on to read poetry for audiobooks and direct several major motion pictures. The bedrock of bass - Smalls - has gone on to be a world reknowed commentator for the Cartoon Simpsins.

The feat was done several times after that, but there are reasons why ""Spinal Tap"" still has survived them all. One of them is: It's downright hilarious, and another: The music is great. Plus: It's louder, ONE louder! Yep, that's because they have amplifiers that go to up to eleven!Played straight, a lot of it improvised, yet definitely not entirely invented, Reiner and company go for laughs which seem to be inherent in the music business they portray: Get ready for drummer combustion, bizarre deadly gardening accidents, sleek, pastel black covers, big bottoms and grave songs, then there's Artie Fufkin from Polymer Records, serious snack problems, managing wives, Artie Fufkin, Polymer Records, guitars you better not look at, well, it's all there.

The Fine Line,"While neither 'movies' about rock bands, nor spoof documentaries were new inventions at the time this was made, this is the best in its class.The point of departure is, of course, Idle's ""The Rutles"", though the construction of the visual humor is completely different. Idle and the Pythons are experts at skit construction, chiefly the juxtaposition of two unrelated activities in the frame, or introducing one element that is seriously out of place -- worked great for television, and for their first movie experiment.Reiner approaches this -first and foremost- as a movie. He frames it for us as a 'documentary'; we and everyone within are fully aware of the fact that it's a movie.The biggest controversy arises right away...are Spinal Tap real? And the answer is yes! How is a writing team of Guest, McKean, Shearer and Reiner any different from innumerable acts who also use 'stage names' and alternate identities? They write, perform and record their own music.What the studio didn't understand (and if I remember correctly, for this reason they shelved this movie for over a year), is that what is invented is not the band, but the -perception- of the band and the -perception- of their fame. Reiner expertly causes the confusion by framing the contents with 'interviews' with the fans, by framing the music with a complete discography (even a series of 'critiques'), and by framing each shot in such a way that allows full improv freedom. Improvised camera movement. Improvised scenes. His editing of jokes is top notch -- no dithering or second-guessing.The actual joke content and plot doesn't need description, all of that is plain to see on the canvas -- side-splitting, naturally. What makes it worthwhile is being in the know; knowing where that fine line is between frame and canvas, and between rock lore and hyperbole.Reiner's frame/canvas construction was his calling card in the '80s ('Stand by Me', 'Princess Bride'). But this was his best.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The narrator Marty DiBergi (Meat Head ... oops Rob Reiner) carries us through a sort of cerebral humor like Bud Abbott Lou Costello's ""who's on first"" opposed to pure slapstick. This film is quite unique and fun for 15 minutes. Then it repeats itself over and over and over. Then it just sorts of stops.This presentation looks more like a roll call for unemployed actors. Of course, there is always one exception and this exception is Ed Begley Jr.; he performed outstandingly as John 'Stumpy' Pepys. If he was not such a great actor, this could've been his profession. Ed really can play the drums.Now you might think this is a period piece. However, the reality is someone dusted it off for the Blu-ray Ziete.Sorry, I'm not a snob but I waited for the Blu-ray edition before I watched this movie. Therefore I cannot compare it to previous versions. However, it looks very grainy and I do not think it was on purpose. There is an audio commentary by Michael McKean and Christopher Guest that tries to justify the movie but spends more time with their cerebral humor.From this movie, Rob Reiner moved into obscurity.

All involve manage to push every situation to its limits without making the fatal step into ridiculous slap-stick or obvious parody. The ignorant, self-delusional, preening, mock-sincerity of celebrities, heard in a thousand interviews over the years, is perfectly captured. What makes these characters all the more tragic is that they remain forever clueless as to just how dumb and talentless they really are.The performances from the leads are incredible, with each actor completely inhabiting his character, bringing a depth and honesty that is genuinely award-worthy. The dialogue, much of it improvised, is pure gold, with more quotable lines per minute than just about any other film in history.

The Majesty of Rock.,"""This is Spinal Tap!"" is simply  more than a film as any owner of the special edition DVD will tell you. The concept and whole project is frankly marvellous, whether it is the ""Heavy Metal Memories"" spoof boxset advert or the apeing of the 1965 ish Beatles in their ""Listen to the Flower People"" press conference.The humour works on many levels in this film, and yet it all derives from the fact that the band are a bunch of ""washed up, brain dead, 4 chord rockers"". Who can forget the Puppet Show getting top billing? Or the fact that the Tap thought having a bigger dressing room than the puppets was some kind of victory?""This is Spinal Tap"" COULD be a documentary, if all the rock anecdotes are to believed, and so, the guilty pleasure of seeing a bunch of 40 somethings spewing garbage, self important philosophy whilst carrying on like the aristocracy of rock is something the people who read or seen interviews of rock bands can relate to.The music certainly doesn't let down the jokes with some great performances of songs that, in some cases, surpasses the genres it  mocks or imitates.The true indication of Spinal Tap's greatness is not what they took and pariodied from Rock, but what Rock took from them, Amps that go past ten and Metallica's ""black album"" immediately come to mind.Funniest film ever?

Truly ingenious film.,"THIS IS SPINAL TAP is a ""rockumentary"" chronicling the fictitious UK band Spinal Tap on a US tour. This band consists of lead singer David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), drummer Mick Shrimpton (R.J. Parnell), keyboardist Viv Savage (David Kaff), and their manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra). Unfortunately, Spinal Tap's followers are thinning out, and all of their marketing schemes seem to fall short, causing Faith to quit as the manager and David's girlfriend Jeanine Pettibone (June Chadwick) to take over, becoming something of a Yoko Ono. General band conflicts ensue.THIS IS SPINAL TAP is an incredibly clever parody on many (or maybe all) metal bands of the '80s. They have their gimmicks, their crazy stage antics, and their animosities and comradery. Some of the jokes in the movie are sheerly random (the cucumber in Derek's pants at the airport), while some are just ingenious (the amp that goes up to 11 instead of 10). But everything is truly hilarious, and will make you ask yourself, ""What the hell?!"" through your laughter. Other high points include the Stonehenge performance, Nigel's song in D minor, and the cover of Spinal Tap's new album, ""Smell the Glove.""What an inventive movie. The script is absolutely classic, and all of the actors are priceless and great in their roles, namely Michael McKean and Christopher Guest as the Lennon and McCartney of Spinal Tap.

"Talented, but a bit out of date.","This Is Spinal Tap (1984) -After such a long time this film hasn't aged amazingly, but I am sure that it must have been one of the leaders of the comedic parody.Perhaps if I'd watched it back in 1984 and been the appropriate age, I may have claimed this film as the funny and ironic picture that it is reputed to be too.But turning up to it in 2022 after nearly 40 years of other comedies that have provided more laughs and parodies that have nailed their mimicry so well, it just feels like it falls a bit flat now. It's not as timeless as the likes of 'Airplane!' (1980), 'Hot Shots' (1991) or 'Spaceballs' (1987).And it's difficult to write a review of a film when you've been told that it's a must watch, only to find out that you had to have been there when it was released to truly appreciate it. Although surely the mark of a good film is that it still captures the viewers interest even years later - 'Gone With The Wind' (1939), 'Forrest Gump' (1994), 'Jurassic Park' (1993) and 'Star Wars' (1977) are just a few examples.I'm probably being a bit unjust to the Tap though, because they all did a good job and there were some funny moments, but there were a lot of other times where it was just too busy and unclear.The other thing is that there are similar bands that are actually out there in the real world and so it's easy to forget that the film was not meant to be taken seriously, especially when you think of the shenanigans of the Osbourne (Ozzy, Sharon, Etc) family as seen on various MTV programmes.The format of a mockumentary rockumentary was a great and forward thinking idea and it obviously lead the way.I also really liked the ""stock"" footage of the bands 60's performances, Etc.The music was good and well played and the dodgy lyrics quite funny, although there have been some genuine songs with worse lyrics actually released.The whole concept was clever, with some elements similar to 'Wayne's World' (1992) and 'The Doors' (1991), but to a lesser degree, as well as hints of 'Red Dwarf' (1988-).I would also have liked a few more obvious jokes that had a bit more longevity to them, as it was very clearly an 80's style of comedy, some of which was a bit cringey.I know a lot of people will say that I'm wrong about this one, but I would ask them to try and imagine what it's like for me to turn up to it brand new after all this time, as I have tried to imagine how it would have felt to watch it when it was released.Does it deserve to be on my scratch off poster of 100 films to watch if it isn't still enjoyable for newer generations or viewers coming to it late? After all we can only base our opinions on how it seems to us now, until someone creates a scientific way around that.440.34/1000.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
The Best Band to Have Never Existed,"I'm going to avoid making the obligatory ""goes to 11"" joke in this comment, hehe...This movie has become a comedy classic. The film is a mockumentary about the worst (greatest?) heavy metal band to have never existed: Spinal Tap. My friend introduced me to the film when he discovered I'd never seen it, immediately demanding I give it a viewing. I'm glad he did, as this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. The entire film is played as a real documentary as it follows the band on tour in America to promote a new album and we get a glimpse into the small minds of the band.The movie is directed by Rob Reiner, who also has a part in the movie as documentarian and Spinal Tap fan, Marty DiBergi. The band's key members are the comedy team of Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer. These guys were AMAZING; most of the movie was filmed unscripted with improvised lines and these guys were hilarious (for further proof, listen to the character commentary on the special edition DVD). In addition to the humor, the film also has some pretty addicting music. The film's stars all played their own instruments and did their own vocals, and they sound great. I can't tell you how long I had ""Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight"" stuck in my head after watching this film.I can understand how people became confused and believed Spinal Tap to be a real bad; it almost had me believing it until I realized the lead singer was Michael McKean. The film is played completely straight-faced and that only makes it funnier when the band encounters a myriad of problems on the road; the scene backstage when Nigel is discussing his food selections with Ian Faith (the manager, Tony Hendra) is hilarious. Those who haven't yet seen Reiner's film are missing out on this cult classic.Watching this film again, I really wish the three actors would get together for a little reunion tour....",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The best film about the loudest rock band!,"Turn your speakers up to 11, Spinal Tap is back!  The loudest rock band ever to hit America chronicles their Smell The Glove Tour in this wonderfully funny film.  You get to see the glory of rock and roll from the band's perspective.  Thrill as you listen to such Tap classics as Big Bottom, Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You (Tonight), Sex Farm, and Rock & Roll Creation.  Gasp as you learn of the terrible realization that Spinal Tap's cover to Smell The Glove is deemed offensive and sexist.  Try not to laugh as the band is hopelessly lost under a stage in Cleaveland shouting ""rock and roll!!""  A wonderfully original film that has been copied many times over, but never matched.

Possibly the funniest movie ever made,"A great film! I remember the first time I saw it. I was at a party in 1985 and someone rented it. There was discussion after the film as to whether the band was real or not. It seemed obvious to me at the time that it was a mockumentary, but there was a musician in the crowd who'd seen Nigel Tufnel on the cover of Guitar Player magazine. Almost 20 years later, the movie still stands as a masterpiece. Guest's later Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show, and I'm sure the upcoming A Mighty Wind, are also very well done, but the music in Spinal Tap is what sets it apart. The DVD is nice, but I was disappointed by the commentary by the guys in character. I'd rather have had something more substantial. If you haven't seen the movie, see it now!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Here's where the phrase started,"On TVTropes, I constantly heard the phrase ""Up To Eleven"" being used. I even frequently used it myself when editing the website, even though I had never seen the movie. The funny thing is that even in the movie itself they make fun of this. It features the interviewer wondering why they don't just make ten louder. I didn't even recognize Harry Shearer in this. He's such a talented entertainer I have to acknowledge him.The funniest line is probably when they mention choking on vomit, but not his own vomit. The biggest appeal to this movie is probably how realistic it is. Spinal Tap isn't a real band, but they certainly seem like one here. With all the controversy and crazy things going on bands, it's great to have a piece of satire like this. Everyone acts like they are in a real documentary and while not as good as ""Borat"", still a significant film. I'll ignore ""An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn!"" over this. ***1/2",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"""There's such a fine line between clever and stupid,"" and Tap finds it every time","""There's such a fine line between clever and stupid,"" says David St. Hubbins, Spinal Tap's lead singer, and this movie finds it each and every time.  Spinal Tap is the fake documentary of ""The sights, the sounds, the smells of one of England's loudest bands.""  They also happen to be one of England's (or anywhere's) worst bands, and they are on a fast decent to nowhere while promoting their album ""Smell the Glove.""One of the many, many delights of the film is in showing just how low the band goes (the lowest is being billed behind a puppet show at a local amusement park).  But this film gives so much more than that descent.  It truly has its pulse on the vast humor that stupidity can provide, and as it gives us a clueless and derivative rock band, the cleverness in how it brings us it's stupidity is never less than breathtaking.The film is only 82 minutes, which is hard to believe, given how many jokes, both subtle and not so subtle, are thrown at us.  It's like Airplane, except instead of giving us sight gags and groaners, it gives us biting sarcasm and brilliant insight into the worst that rock n' roll can provide. The amazing thing is that unlike Airplane, there isn't one miss in the bunch.  Every joke in this film is at least funny, and many need a stronger adjective to express it's level of humor.This film is in one way an attack on a Rock n' Roll industry that allows a band like Spinal Tap to hang around, inexplicably, for twenty years, but this film is in no way a great social commentary.  It is a spoof. Well, actually, that's not really accurate.  It is THE spoof.  Every one before and after it will inevitably be compared to it, and ultimately, unfavorably.This is Spinal Tap is now rightfully a comedy classic.  I dare say that only ""The Holy Grail"" compares in being the most quoted movie of all time (at least among the Gen X set).  It deserves its place.  In my viewing of over 2,000 films in my life, I not only say without hesitation that it is the funniest film I have ever seen, I probably won't ever see a funnier oneIf you have seen Spinal Tap once and strongly disagree, my advice is to see it again.  It will allegedly be in theaters next year.  Spinal Tap needs at least six viewings to fully appreciate all of its humor.  The first time I saw it I was confused, the second I was amazed, and the third I was dying laughing.Although there are at least fifty jokes that are truly hysterical, a few do stand out, especially Big Bottoms and ""These go to eleven.""  But don't see it watching for just the biggies, because there is so much humor tucked slightly beneath the surface that you will miss most of it (chances are you will miss at least twenty jokes from laughing alone).  But do yourself a favor and see the funniest movie ever captured on film, and find that fine line between clever and stupid, because if you do, you will never look at cucumbers the same way again.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I think it would sound better in Dubly .......,"** NO SPOILERS **Put simply, this is probably the best satire ever made and certainly one of the funniest films you will ever see, no exaggeration. Spinal Tap is also that rare commodity, a comedy that actually gets funnier the more you watch it. Spinal Tap is one of those films, like Withnail & I, that has attained absolute cult status and is undoubtedly more popular today than it ever was on it's theatrical release.As far as I can see, the only impediment to enjoying this film would be if you have no recollection of (or knowledge of if you're a younger film fan) the heady, mulleted days of 80's heavy metal.As with all spoof documentaries, the very best are those which manage to combine hilarious satire in a film which is so well made you could actually almost be convinced it was real. This is doubtless helped not only by the charismatic performances of the main trio of the band, but also by the fact that the whole film is never played for laughs - the quality of the script and the deadpan performances are what really make this so funny. This is clever stuff indeed and if there is any lesson to be learnt it's that 99% of musicians, much like film stars, are often spoilt, self-indulgent little children who really are not worthy of the adulation they receive (just in case you really needed reminding).I have deliberately not revealed much about the plot or gags because they really are best seen for yourself (also, you will find yourself repeating them ad nauseam between friends and colleagues for years to come). The performances are stunning throughout and the fact that three main stars of the group (Tufnell, St. Hubbins and Smalls) actually played and recorded the songs featured in the film adds immeasurably to the experience. The lyrics of the songs themselves are enough to have you falling out of your seat and ""killer"" tracks like ""Stonehenge"", ""Big Bottom"", or ""Rock 'n' Roll Creation"" will forever more be indelibly etched onto your brain.I really can't recommend this movie highly enough. Only those people who still think mullets, leather jackets and spandex trousers are cool should avoid this film. Everyone else - jump aboard, you won't regret it (And if you get the Special Edition DVD, you are treated to an audio commentary by the film's stars, in character, that is almost as funny as the main feature).10 out of 10 - No doubt about it - Rob Reiner's finest hour.As a final point, if you are one of those afore-mentioned people who has no knowledge of 80's heavy metal, the film CB4 is as close as you will ever get to a hip-hop equivalent (which although entertaining is not in the same league as Spinal Tap) and may prove more approachable for younger viewers or those who really can't stand wailing guitars.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Luvved It!,"Musings: To think that now, after 20-odd years, there are STILL hair bands out there seriously toiling, with their skin-tight leather pants and padded crotches, make-up and jewelry! I wonder how many of these pretty little girly men have affected an English accent? And if they are not really popular, where their music and performing makes them enough money to live on, to buy some insularity, where do they go when they are not on stage or rehearsing indoors ""with the lads""? I would not want to go out to the grocery store or hardware store or any other place looking like that. Surely, in those getups, you'd be inviting an ass-kicking, would you not?That's what always amazed me about the Rolling Stones: Jagger played the part of the tough ""Street-Fighting Man"", but at the same time the little twerp, who weighed, what, about 140, would prance around in his capes and makeup like a bleeding fairy. But I liked the Stones for years anyway (but not now because they are too old and make too much money for playing music that they played 30+ years ago; it's a disgrace and they should be ashamed). Unlke most of us, and like the Stones, Spinal Tap didn't have to face any of this aggro because they, at least at one time, could fill stadiums! And in this movie they are running on the fumes of their previous success.Sorry about the digression. EVERYTHING about this movie is perfect. I was raised on rock (Stones, Beatles, Jeff Beck, The Who, Rod Stewart, Ten Years After, Blodwyn Pig, King Crimson, etc.) and this music and its practitioners had been screaming out for parody. Thank God that mssrs. Guest, McKean, Reiner, et.al. have done it up right. The endless series of exploding drummers, the choking on SOMEONE ELSE'S vomit, the fatal gardening accidents, the hissy fit over the dressing room refreshments, Fred Willard, the one-foot actual size reproduction of Stonehenge, Derek being trapped in the plastic pod, Paul Shaffer's character begging them to kick his ass, the manager, the girl friend, the songs, the lyrics, the accents.Christopher Guest is an absolute genius and a fantastic actor.

Probably Takes Some Getting Used To,"This film is essentially about a so-called heavy metal group named ""Spinal Tap"" who have found that their customer base has been shrinking and have therefore launched a come-back tour to recapture their lost glory-as if they ever had any to begin with. Be that as it may, even though their new manager named ""Ian Faith"" (Tony Hendra) tries his best to set things up for their United States tour it soon becomes quite obvious that he is totally incompetent for the job at hand. Also quite evident is the fact that the band members are equally clueless about why their music doesn't attract large audiences. So they continue to produce one idiotic song after the other and devise all kinds of failed stage gimmicks in the mistaken belief that they are somehow on the verge of a major breakthrough. When these don't work the manager quits and is replaced by the lead singer's girlfriend ""Jeanine Pettibone"" (June Chadwick) who is even more incompetent than Ian ever was. Not surprisingly, things get even worse at that point. In any case, while this turned out to be a decent comedy for the most part, I should also mention that it probably takes some getting used to. Because of that, some viewers may not like it that much and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great, but could have been even better.","I bought the DVD version of ""Spinal Tap"" which includes two hours of deleted scenes. This was originally a 4 1/2 hour movie, that was cut down to a 82 minute film. Tons of scenes were taken out, and in my opinion, Reiner took out too many. Some of the funniest scenes are in the deleted extras. For example, an interview with Billy Crystal as the head-mime was hilarious. Bruno Kirby, the bands limo driver, falls into peer pressure with the band. Nigel and the boys get him high off dope, and Kirby ends up in his underwear singing Frank Sinatra. Why these scenes were removed are a mystery, but I'm glad I was able to see them on the DVD version. Try to see 'em if you can.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
As close as American comedy ever got to Monty Python.,"From the moment you see Carl Reiner use the word ""Rockumentary"" with such earnestness, you know you're in for a treat. This is one of the best movie satires of all time, and of a subject richly deserving the treatment--the overblown world of rock music in general and heavy metal in particular.I don't think this movie did well at the box office, initially; a lot of people weren't clear that it was actually a comedy. I remember seeing it when it first came out, in one of those shoebox cineplexes that sprung up everywhere in the 80s. The audience--about 12 people--were evenly split between those of us who got the joke (yes, I WAS in that category) and some thick-as-a-brick metalheads who didn't and thought this was about a real band. I think they started to catch on when the dwarf starting kicking around the itsy-bitsy Stonehenge model, but I can't be sure.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Still hilarious after two decades,"`This is Spinal Tap' was such a brilliant concept twenty years ago Â– a documentary about a fake rock band, that people thought (and some still think) that it is a `real' film.  Unlike a lot of comedies to come out of the past two decades, the humor is still relevant and still as hilarious, long after the glam-rock and hair-band phases have (blissfully) passed us by Â– for the most part.It's easy to categorize the primary actors by their seminal roles throughout the years, Michael McKean as Lenny, Harry Shearer as many voices on The Simpsons, and Christopher Guest asÂ… well, the guy in `Heartbeeps' I guess, but after having seen all of the Guest `mockumentaries' and revisiting `Spinal Tap' after catching bits and pieces throughout the years, their talent is undeniable.  It's also testimony to the brilliance of the writing when one realizes how many jokes and site gags are still scattered in pop culture today Â– there were several cases where I thought, `So THAT'S where that came from!'`This is Spinal Tap' is one of the funniest movies I've seen in the past twenty years, a high compliment from someone who doesn't find what generally passes as `comedy' funny unless it's from a film made prior to 1965 or a film directed by Woody Allen.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it Â– and watch out for the DVD with the various trailers on it.  The `Cheese Rolling' trailer is a riot.--Shelly",9.0,Anonymous,Music
All the way to eleven!,"The only thing funnier than 'This Is Spinal Tap' is the people who didn't get the joke. Leafing through the reviews on Amazon and IMDb, I came upon a couple of one star reviews along the lines of 'it was an okay documentary but why make a film about this band nobody's heard of when there were lots of better bands around?' There was even one guy who, apparently attempting to appear musically educated, stated that he remembers hearing some of Spinal Tap's hits in the 70's, but they were nothing special. The fact that there are a few who failed to realize that Spinal Tap were a fictitious band, created specifically for this mockumentary, is a testament to the subtle intelligence of the humor and the preciseness of the film's parody, as well as to the dreadful overall state of mainstream rock in the late 70's and early 80's.In his first feature film, Rob 'Meathead' Reiner disguises himself as documentary maker Marty DiBergi and follows around the comeback US tour of has-been heavy metal dinosaurs Spinal Tap. Reiner did not invent the fake documentary Â– and I don't care what Charlie (or was it Donald?) Kaufman says, it wasn't Fellini either Â– the concept can be traced back to the brilliant opening scene of 'Citizen Kane' and even earlier than that Â– but no film prior to 'This Is Spinal Tap' was this loyal and uncompromising in its documentary structure and in its invented reality. Reiner, Guest and co. took the joke to the very limits, and it's easy to see that with the DVD bonus features, which include TV commercials made by Spinal Tap, video clips, press conferences and TV appearances from across the band's history, even an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.Spinal Tap are everything that was silly, trite and ridiculous about the music industry in the early 80's. In their Prima Dona behavior, their stupid quarreling, their idiotic, half-baked pseudo-philosophic wisdom, and most of all in their songs, Spinal Tap put a distorting mirror in front of half the bands that were around at the time; and any band that was insulted because they thought the joke was on them, merely proved the point. The songs use every clichÃ© of rock music without shame, and the performances of Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer as the band-mates are precise, merciless and hilarious. Best of all is Guest as virtuoso guitarist Nigel Tuffnel, who is beyond brilliant in several unforgettable scenes (including the classic 'the dials go up to eleven' routine), but is also hilarious when he doesn't say a word; his body language and facial expressions while playing on stage spoof any self-proclaimed genius guitarist of the time, and there's no need for mentioning any names.Again, what makes 'This Is Spinal Tap' great is the subtleness of the humor. Reiner and co. felt no inhibition to supply jokes by the minute as way too many comedies do, and it's an ability he proved again later in the classics 'The Princess Bride' and 'When Harry Met Sally'. The jokes in 'This Is Spinal Tap' do not overshadow the characters and the story told, but with very few actual jokes the film is still unbelievably, consistently, laugh-out-loud roll-on-the-floor funny. Especially for musicians and music lovers in general, who will immediately laugh at many of the easy to miss jokes, 'This Is Spinal Tap' is essential viewing, and one of the funniest films you'll ever see. The DVD is also great, with lost of supplemental material and wonderful deleted scenes, including several with the great Billy Crystal.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Margaux comes to mind,"The nuances of this classic seem wasted on a first-time watcher, though, over time, one appreciates that the hair-brained idiocy of the group is in fact a subtly refined aspect of rock- star behaviour. Each detail is conceived so as to replicate the puerility of stardom in the early 80s, and indeed it is a timeless critique of all those who take themselves too seriously. The beauty of the narrative is that it would work as well as a series of sketches as it does as a film. Such is its continuity that we are deeply aware of the downfall of this band, as much as we are of each instance of their estuary simplicity. The ease with which Hubbins distances his most implacable friend in the penultimate stages of the film is indicative of his deep seated vulnerability, which he so transparently tries to hide. Perhaps this is the whole conceit of Spinal Tap. Buffoons are portrayed, yet they are at least sensitive and unwitting ones with whom we can sympathise. Like a Margaux, with each viewing we glean yet more insight into the complexities that underlie their outward aspect. Though to be sure, like a fine wine we must not get too carried away with the esoteric balderdash that pseudos are sure to attribute to it. Nor should we be tempted to overrate it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
An antagonistically tedious and lazy movie,"I hate this movie. It gives no impression any effort went into any of it.It feels made up on the spot because it is; they decided on scenarios and improvized. Not in the cool spontaneous way like in Creep 2, but in a cheap ""let's just half-ass this movie"" type of way. It's very insulting.Some of the jokes have potential. But they all miscarry because there obviously isn't the comic timing to pull them off. A lot of the jokes don't even make sense. Why shouldn't they put an 11 on the scale? Either stress that they know that it doesn't increase the maximum volume or respect that more intermediate settings is useful to them as musicians. The scenes, dialogue and jokes show no imagination. They seem to have been going for a hoax movie. But what's the point of that? Just watch a real rockumentary.It does not parody or satire. It just checks a list of things rockstars have done and does them. It just rips off reality. It really expects you to laugh at them ripping up small bread. I think it's meant to be a point about how rockstars can be divas but please try and be more creative. Asking to have all the green gummy bears removed: now that's what I'm talking about.And those drawling, ugly British voices... I'm British myself and I hate it.In terms of how it all adds up scene for scene I'm tempted to say there is no movie I hate more than this. At least ""in Search of the Titanic"" is so bad its good and was ballsy enough to be far out with a lot of weird scenes. This movie gives me nothing but a couple of good songs, hence why I gave it a 1 instead of a zero.Apparently its very on the money if you know rock history. But so what? Even if this movie is esoteric, Robot Chicken does a great job of making the joke clear even if you haven't seen the show they're parodying.I don't mind people liking stupid movies but telling me that this has anything smart about it just annoys me. I struggle to see how anyone can like this. This makes Judd Apatow look like Seth Macfarlane. It's not clever. It's not well observed.

Yet the band members go virtually unfazed by these major indications of their decline due largely to the reassurance of their manager. His reassurances that the bands is still great are almost as funny as the problems the band is experiencing,  but in reality they are a long way from the moderate success they once had.The songs in the music are not only very funny, but are usually pretty good.Highly recommend!!!

These go to eleven... number one cult movie,"Rob Reiner used to be a good director back in the day, and he made two of the all-time cult classics, This is Spinal Tap and The Princess Bride in the 80s. In a recent poll in some magazine or other, This is Spinal Tap was named the number one cult movie of all time, beating out Harold and Maude, The Shawshank Redemption, Rocky Horror Picture Show, even Freaks. This mockrockumentary is brilliantly funny. Christopher Guest liked the mockumentary style so much that he would use it three more times with Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show, and A Mighty Wind. It is filled with incredibly funny situations... The Stonehedge Concert, not finding their way onto the stage, the concert for veterans, and of course, the ever famous Amplifier going to 11. It is a quietly loud movie, and it is full of fascinating characters, from Rob Reiner's director to the band made up of Michael Mckeon, Harry Shearer, and Christopher Guest, the funniest out of them, who is secretly in love with Michael's character. I didn't really laugh much out loud in this one, but the brilliance of This is Spinal Tap is something special, that is frequently attempted but never equaled.

The film developing a cult following that would generate a sequel, music videos, soundtracks, a business (Spinal Tap Goods and Services INC.) and a anniversary show has been getting more popular as time goes on. As other types of music comes out (ie. the new boy band craze) It makes that much more sence!  It's funny to see all the joys and pains of a band... This movie covers it in a light-hearted manner...This movie is DARN funny, and is a must see on many levels...  The 'complete' movie is 93 minutes long and is available on VHS (The one I have has Bitch School (1984)- A video at the start of the movie that was banned from MTV in the 90's)  I also have the DVD (The Criterion Collection) which has the full footage (4 hour long movie that had to be cut down to the 93 minutes), commentaries, trailers, demo reel, promo shots, and music videos.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Brilliant Satire,"Back in the 70's and 80's, rock and roll was getting out of hand. Everyone wasted it bigger and better...but in the end everything just got expensive and cheap. Stage shows were fun to go to but were so cheap and cheesy you had to wonder why you would watch it in the first place.Rob Reiner and 3 clever British comedians seemed to have noticed this and created their own band-Spinal Tap-that was a satire of the whole hair band and metal craze going on in the time. And they captured everything. Well, almost at least.This may be one of the most quotable movies ever. No line is out of place here. Everything has a purpose, and nothing is FORCED upon you, like in some comedy movies. However there may be a bit of a problem understanding Spinal Tap's British accents. So watch it on DVD-subtitles are a life saver.If you don't find this even slightly amusing, I don't know about you. The actors emotions are portrayed through improvisation and are incredibly real. It seems like an actual documentary (which it is not-its a mock rockumentary) and as a result seems real...seems like a real band, going through real problems. If you know anything about 70's and 80's metal, this movie holds something for you. If you've played an actual gig, it holds even more. But if you have no clue, watch it anyways. It;'s almost impossible not to enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
End of the rocking and rolling,Mockumentary about a British rock and roll band going on tour in the US. I got a couple of laughs but the plot is slow and depressing not good for a comedy. Satirising the whole rock and roll lifestyle and putting a death nail into the genre and starting a new genre of movies. It sets up the generic outline for mockumentaries to follow but fails to include a proper ending.,5.0,Anonymous,Music

It's called lick my love pump!,"A mockumentary about the trials and tribulations of an 80's band past their prime. Rob Reiner directs and acts as the director of this fake film. He introduces us to the world of Spinal Tap. Spinal Tap as a band and a movie emulates the flair and absurdity of a classic rock band as they try to adapt to the pop and glitter of the 80's. We follow them as they try to keep face as they are constantly discouraged by their embarrassing moments. These moments manifest themselves throughout the movie in the form of failed cover art, getting stuck in an alien pod prop and getting stood up at their own record signing. What is most impressive about this film is the acting and song writing abilities of the cast and crew. The acting in itself is an extraordinary feat because these actors must not only act as if they were these enigmatic rock stars but they must also act as if they were these grandiose rock stars being put in front the camera lens. The third wall is broken and at certain points the camera crew themselves are interacted with. This self reflexivity combined with the great musical talent and catchy songs this film produces creates a situation in which a perfect film of the rise and fall of a fictitious absurd rock band displays their musical and acting gumption on the screen",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Can I have one of those amps as well please!?,"Oh this is a wonderful, wonderful film full of inventive humour, clever one-liners, good music and above all biting satire.For those of us who can remember those heady rock years of the late 70s/80s this film will be even more poignant since it covers the fading fortunes of a glam rock band on its last legs touring an uninterested US pop culture. A lot of the gags, therefore, may go right over the heads of todays MTV hiphop dance generation but us oldsters can take a good guess where these guys are firing their lampoons at.One of the infamous lines in the movie is ""there's a very fine line between clever & stupid"". But I also think the film itself is a very fine line between fiction & probable fact. I wonder how many real rock bands have suffered similar ignominy and find watching this film too close to the bone!Another virtue is that the film doesn't have to try hard to get its message across; the actors don't really have to stretch themselves with concise scripts & acting ability - this is, afterall, supposed to be a fly-on-the-wall documentary where adlibbing is encouraged.British TV company, Channel 4, produced a similar tv movie called ""Bad News on Tour"" by The Comic Strip,at around the same time, and although it probably never reached the States it too is very very funny and follows the same kind of adlib roadie logic of its bigger brother. The only difference is that the subtle lampooning is never made so obvious, but its a good film to add to this kind of rockumentary collective.The only shocking thing is the length of the film - barely 80 minutes. Blink and its almost over. I suppose the producers & director Reiner didn't originally have high hopes of box office success & cult status so it was a movie made very much on the defensive I guess, which is a real shame. Just when we're beginning to really know these guys the movie is over and we end up like Oliver Twist, desperately asking for more!And yes, those immortal words ""This amp goes up to 11"" should be recognised with equal merit alongside ""Frankly, my dear...."", ""Play it again, Sam..."" and ""May the force...."".An excellent groupie film for those who like to reflect on those heady days of nostalgia & big flares! ****/*****",8.0,Anonymous,Music

that was dog crap,"This was one of those movies that countless people have recommended me to watch over the years and what a waste of time. Perhaps it's rose tinted glasses as 30+ years ago there was nothing else like this but now .. now this is unwatchable! Sure there was some rockstar cliches. We see their egos and some subtle shots at people like how Yoko Ono influenced John Lennon while he was in the Beatles and of course the evolution of rock music from the 1950s until 1982 give or take when this movie was shot. The ""band"" is a bunch of middle aged men who can pass as musicians as they aren't 20 year old kids and they have the worlds worst wigs on. I'm sure it's intentional though.This is just a bunch of really awful songs that would have been demos that not even a record executive would wipe his backside in his private bathroom with the booklet. They totally deserve the empty autograph singings in the record store about half way into the movie. It makes me wonder if their pure black album inspired Metallica for theirs. However most if not all of the movie you'd have to be inebriated to watch as it's just one unlikable British guy talking over another even more unlikable guy. Is the movie funny? I didn't laugh once not even at that legendary .. my guitar goes to 11 nonsense. This seemed to have heavily inspired the animated series ""Metalocalypse"" without any doubt which is one of my favorite series on Adult Swim before they went down the toilet. They also inspired Steel Panther without any doubt but this movie is just a slog through knee high mud. You watch them on this make believe tour. They play these awful songs which I love 80s rock and metal of that era. Then it's just one ""rockstar"" talking over another I complained about earlier and then rinse and repeat. I'm not after story as this is a mockumentary but seriously ""This Is Anvil"" is miles ahead of how lousy this is. This was just unwatchable. Seriously how does this have any higher than a 4 star? If this came out today even Netflix would say no it's ok. We're fine without it. We'll green light production for 999 other shows but not this one.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

"Hilarious, must see movie from vets of Saturday Night Live.","Definitely IMO one of the best comedies of all time, ""This is Spinal Tap"" is a hilarious and often scathingly true satire documenting the many pitfalls ""Britain's Loudest Band"" encounters while with famed commercial director Marti DiBergi (Rob Reiner).  I won't spoil any of the great gags, but I will say it involves close attention and repeat viewings to get many of the jokes before they happen.  Derek Smalls, Nigel Tufnel, and David St. Hubbins are Spinal Tap (along with drummer Mick Shrimpton and clueless keyboarder Viv Savage) and play many ludicrously titled ""hits"" during the film with hilarious results.  Highly recommended, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
These jokes still work,"You don't have to be a rock historian to know that the days of explicit rap were preceded by an era where rock musicians celebrated sex with song lyrics containing clever (and sometimes unintentionally hilarious) sexual metaphors and innuendo. That's why the songs in ""This is Spinal Tap"" can still make young audiences laugh.This movie is made to look like a documentary which chronicles the tour of Spinal Tap, an aging rock band whose popularity is waning. The hilarious dialogue is often partially improvised. Much of the humor is built around the characters being totally oblivious to the ridiculousness of what they are saying or doing. If you've ever seen VH1's ""Behind The Music,"" you will notice that this movie pokes fun at all the themes of the rockstar existence, except (surprisingly) drug use.The humor is subtle compared to movies such as Wedding Crashers or almost any Martin Lawrence movie, wherein the characters are often telling jokes instead of unknowingly just being a joke. But for people who ""get"" subtle humor, Spinal Tap will have you rolling on the floor at times.For the same brand of humor and much of the same cast, check out ""Best in Show"" and ""Waiting for Guffman.""

Seriously funny,"If you didn't recognize many of the actors, you would be excused for thinking this was a real documentary.  The action seems spontaneous and even thought this feature could be described as having reverse dramatic irony (the actors know what's happening but we don't) or elements of a Greek tragedy (the actors know what's going to happen, but can't prevent it), the fact you know its not a real documentary doesn't detract from the movie's charm.  The actors treat their roles with utter seriousness - this is not an ""Airplane"" style spoof of the genre, and as a result, the humour runs the gamut from the sublime (the band members acting genuinely confused about why their mock bondage album cover ""Sniff the Glove"" might be deemed sexist) to the drop dead funny (midgets dancing around desperately undersized replicas of Stonehenge).The movie also walks a fine line between the scripted plot and much of the improvised dialogue.  We have a group of actors here so skilled in improvisation that its scary how they can't be thrown by the reactions of their fellow actors.  However, despite this, the characters are totally consistent and often easy to understand and empathize with.All in all, instead of having a comedy with funny line or slapstick, we have one that puts the actors in an otherwise tragic situation and uses their own denial about it to draw the humour out.  We laugh because we foresee the decline and fall of Spinal Tap, we know the actors know whats coming, but still their characters, in the face of all evidence to the contrary, believe that the iceberg will somehow move out of the way before the ship hits it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Spinal Tap is cult, and despite being in ludicrous situations all the time, I think they also quite accurately show us how a rock band works, like a talented version of KISS. The bizarre thing is that the music they play is actually very good. It's like they found some leftover rock clichÃ©s and made something good of them. The focus is mostly on fake behind the scenes footage though, that classic scene where they can't find the stage anymore always does the trick for me. I also love when they get a sneak preview of their album cover and it's just entirely black. And then there are about a hundred other moments.

It was a rock 'n' roll creation,"The soundtrack itself is stand alone (satirical) brilliance, before we even delve into the mockumentary of the fictitious British band whose speakers are so loud, they go to eleven. Reiner's documentary style film follows the band on its tour of the USA, as they traverse the country playing to half empty houses, experiencing myriad crises (e.g. band members leaving, shows being cancelled) and minor debacles (e.g. the appetisers and set work). Their struggle to deliver a unique brand despite the critics scorn is nothing short of heroic.The principal trio (McKean, Guest and Shearer) are pitch perfect as no-brain rockers with dim ideas and infantile (yet still potent) lyrics (""big bottom, big bottom, talk about mud flaps my girl's got 'em""), led around by their faithful manager (Hendra) enduring every ignominy a touring band could experience from getting lost en route to the stage via the green room to the bass player becoming locked inside a cocoon as part of an act. Director Reiner plays the band's documenter, Patrick MacNee has a cameo as a promoter and Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Ed Begley Jnr, Howard Hesseman and Paul Schaefer all have bit parts.Highlights include the Stonehenge ""malfunction"", Guest's discussion with the director about the tempo of his speakers and the band's frank confessions about their sexual promiscuity (""we've got armadillos down our trousers, it's truly frightening"").

It has more riotously funny moments than even some of Mel Brooks stuff. My favorites - the amplifier (""but this one goes to 11""), the Stonehendge set, ""what's the name of that tune you're playing"", the airbase concert, and on and on. The dialogue is brilliantly funny, capturing perfectly the egotistical pretentiousness and intellectual vapidity of many of those in the entertainment industry. Rob Reiner himself plays the documentary film maker, and watch for cameos by Ed Begley Jr., Billy Crystal, Patrick Macnee (remember John Steed?), and Paul Shaffer.Rumor has it that the documentary style of this film was so convincing that a good many shall we say cerebrally challenged viewers thought it was real, a fact which only adds to the hilarity.

He has never casted his famous wife or equally famous in-laws (Janet Leigh or Tony Curtis). I thought he directed this film. He did not but Rob Reiner who plays in it too. I have seen most of Christopher Guest films like Best in Show, A Mighty Wind, and I just adore his directing style. He has the same group of talented actors like Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, JEnnifer Coolidge, Jane Lynch, Parker Posey, Catherine O'Hara, EUgene Levy, etc. This film shows the beginning of his genius as well.

You can't help but laugh at a band who descibes their music in deep, philosophical terms while writing songs like ""Big Bottom"" and ""Sex Farm."" It's amazing how many real-life bands in the 80's seemed to share the same mentality as these guys.Unfortunately, this also happens to be one of the most difficult to find movies around, as it's been out of print on video for years.

"Review Of ""This Is Spinal Tap""","""This Is Spinal Tap"" is a 1984 Rob Reiner mockumentary about the failing fictitious rock and roll group, Spinal Tap, and their attempts to get back on top of the charts. The film stars Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer as the main group members. What surprised me most about this film is that most of the films dialogue was improvised by Reiner, McKean, Guest, and Shearer. It works quite well throughout the film, as the jokes feel more organic and not staged. There's not much else to say about ""Spinal Tap"". It's a really clever movie that's modestly executed and it, in all honesty, pays off. While, it's not a solid eleven (ha ha see what I did there?) in my book, it's still a freaking hilarious movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great comedy (for those who ""get it"")","""Working on a sex farmPlowing through your beanfieldPicking up my pitchforkAnd poking your hay.""How can you not love inane lyrics like that?  As a beginning musician, I often read/heard other musicians make quips about ""the saddest of all keys"", ""now that's a rock and roll town"", and ""this one goes to 11"".  It wasn't until I saw This Is Spinal Tap that it all became clear.  If you have ever been in a band, you will ""get it"".  There are so many in-jokes that a lot of people wouldn't appreciate, but I have several non-musician friends who love this movie as well.  And the commentary on DVD is worth the purchase alone for those who are already familiar with the movie... the guys take their act and have 20 more years worth of pop culture to spoof (the Jerry Maguire bit killed me).A must-see for anyone who can appreciate today's ridiculous Behind the Music ""rockumentaries"".",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Behind the Music: Spinal Tap,"In 1984, Rob Reiner was already a TV veteran, but when he did his first theatrical feature, his choice was a bit odd for a ""debut"". Along with friends Christopher Guest, Harry Shearer and Michael McKean, they crafted a monumental satire that stands out as a landmark of comedy: A documentary that shows the life of one of Britain's legendary heavy metal bands, Spinal Tap.The ""mockumentary"" follows Spinal Tap in their latest tour across the U.S. after releasing their album ""Smell the glove"". Famous Commercials Director Mary DiBergi (Rob Reiner himself) is our guide and he follows the band everywhere, from parties to concerts, and we witness the brilliant genius of Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean) and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), and whoever is their drummer in turn.The satire is constant an outstanding, nothing is left untouched and we have fun with all the antics of the failed rock-stars. Really, this is a work of a team, as our main characters are as real as they can be (in fact, many people thought that Spinal Tap was real). This is probably its most remarkable feature, everything is so realistic that is fun. The creative team really did an amazing job with the characters.Fans of rock n' roll will find references to everything from Eric Clapton to Kiss, from The Beatles to Black Sabbath and from Bon Jovi to MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e. Nobody escapes from the sharp satire this movie uses. However, it is important to point out that the songs were also written by the team, and that Spinal Tap really do perform their set (they also did a real tour in-character for a while too).The acting is great, as I wrote above, the performances are very real, so real that is quite hard to believe that Spinal never existed. It's hard to give credit to only one person because the movie is the work of a team. Everyone did a great job in keeping the movie look as real as it can be, Reiner, the main stars, and the countless extras, it is a perfectly crafted ""documentary"".If a flaw can be found in the movie, is that it is really more rewarding when you are aware of the things they make fun of (specially since real rock-stars have stated that things depicted in the movie really have happened to some of them). However, this doesn't mean that you have to be a rocker to understand it; the situations are quite funny and the humor is so clever, that actually anyone will enjoy it.11/10.

The Greatest Comedy of ALL TIME!,"This movie separates those with a sharp sense of humor from the merely sentient.  No one thinks this movie is ""average"" or ""okay.""  You either ""get it"" or you don't; those who don't look at those who do with a puzzled look in their eyes, as though they know they're missing something but aren't sure what.  Sometimes they are even bitter.  I've noticed that many of the comments here say that music people are the ones who always love this movie, and maybe they do get a bit of a head start on the situational comedy; but in the long run, it's those who appreciate sarcasm and satire, along with a good ""turn of the phrase"" that really appreciate this film.  Is this slapstick humor laced with subtlety or subtle comedy laced with slapstick? The beauty is, it's really hard to tell. ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is one of those few films whose phraseology has made its way into the English language.  ""But these go to eleven"" and ""There's a fine line between clever and stupid"" may not yet be as famous as ""Frankly, Scarlett, I don't give a damn"" or ""Life is like a box of chocolates,"" but they are gaining fast.  Watch as one Taphead utters a ""Tapism"" in the presence of another:  ""The answer is none--none more black."" Boom!--immediate kinship, for both instantly know that they are part of the limited fraternity that revels in enjoyment of this movie.  The opposite of this is when an unhappy new viewer, being forced to watch the film by his or her Taphead friend, turns to him three-quarters through the movie and says, ""I can't believe this is a real band.""

The Best Mockumentary Ever!,"Even though it was made 20 years ago it hasn't lost any of its flavor that made it such an incredible original that will without a doubt eventually become a classic. The best part about this was an amazing back up cast that came in for cameos a long time before they were famous including Fran Drescher, Billy Crystal, Dana Carvey, and Fred Willard. What made it so funny was that even though it was satire a lot of the dialog they were using is how real rockers talk in interviews and such. They did it perfectly and I can see why Christopher Guest and company shot to legendary status right after this even though I'm not always the biggest fan of his. A film very similar to this but for a rap group is ""CB4"" which is also very comical but this certainly took the cake. The songs are actually decent as well and probably served a basis for ""Tenacious D"" as an inspiration since they are very close sounding even though ""The D"" takes it even more over the top.

This film goes to 11,"Truly classic rock 'n roll ""mockumentary"" on a fake UK band that are on tour supposedly in the fall of 1982 and are followed around by Marti DeBergi (Rob Reiner) to capture some of the most funny, sardonic, wet/dry (all improv-ed thru ""scene sketches"" by the way) comedy Americans, I think, have ever created regarding British bands. An insiders movie -- like ""The Player"" by Robert Altman -- if you don't like, er, ""get"", the music industry (especially its vapid nature of heavy metal in the 1980's) then I STILL think this is funny for all.

A classic of the genre,"I am giving this a very high rating - 9.  This should be taken in the context of the type of movie it is.  It certainly does not compare to ambitious, classic movies of all time.  However, if you like the subject matter, I think you will not find a better movie of this style.  It is a ""rockumentary"", somewhat in the style of VH1's ""Behind the Music"", but without the spoken commentary.  It really captures the feel of a real documentary, turned comedy.  One reason it is so well done is that a whole album of original music was created just for this movie, which makes the band ""virtually"" real, if you get my drift.  And the music is great - that is, it's not that good.  It certainly is bombastic though, and could very easily have actually been an album from that time period.  If you are a rock fan, and especially if you grew up in the 60s/70s, this is a must see, with several classic quips that all party-goers must be familiar with, such as ""this one goes to 11.""",9.0,Anonymous,Music

One of the best comedy films (about ANYTHING) ever!,"INTRODUCTION:  In 1982, an aging (40ish) English band is embarking on its 1st American tour in 6 years to promote a new album, ""Smell the Glove,"" which is not quite ready for distribution due to dispute over its lurid, sexist cover art.  Spinal Tap has had its commercial and popularity ups-and-downs since the mid 1960s.  Although known as one of England's loudest heavy-metal bands, their catalogue actually includes a wide range of musical styles.  The 3 primary musicians include guitarist and lead vocalist David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitarist and auxillary vocalist Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and bass guitarist and background vocalist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer).David is a somewhat pompous, pseudo-intellectual who likes ruffles, velvet and satin stage attire and has a rather pushy New-Age girlfriend (Jeanine exerts a major cosmic influence on David's life and creates a wedge between him and childhood friend Nigel).  Nigel is a confused chain-smoking, gum-chewing, accomplished guitarist with strong juvenile tendencies, a love of kilts, and a knack for inane invention.  Derek prefers a studs-and-leather stage presence but is perhaps the most intelligent of the lot and assumes the role of realist and peacemaker.Filmmaker and fan Martin DiBergi (Rob Reiner) accompanies them on this tour to create a documentary of the experience, but Spinal Tap will later accuse Marty of making a ""hatchet job"" by portraying them in an unfavorable and unflattering light.  Marty's film does tend to focus on the historic failings of the band, their apparent waning popularity, and the few(?) times on tour when they couldn't find the stage; had cancellations, production failures, embarrassments, and lapses in competence; bickered amongst themselves; acted like prima donnas; sported their cold sores; and couldn't meaningfully or coherently answer his interview questions.The film is almost entirely improvised from a skeletal plan.  The comedy is subtly and richly layered with humorous but realistic character portrayals/development, malapropisms, double entendres, and numerous sight gags.  No laugh track needed or wanted here! These guys are not only brilliant improvisors, but they are also fine musicians capable of performing a serious-but-quirky, full-length concert (1993 ""Return of Spinal Tap"" concert/comedy video).  They really have written and performed all the wonderful lyrics and arrangements by themselves.  Classics like ""Big Bottom"" and ""Sex Farm.""REVIEWER CONTEXT:  48-year-old female (a scientist and not in the entertainment or music business) who saw the movie for the first time (!) in October 2000 and who loves rock-and-roll (particularly the 1960s and 1970s ""British Invasion"" bands) but is not attuned to raucous ""heavy metal"" sounds or to outrageously gross personas.  Comedy preferences include the Monty Python features, the Pink Panther series, A Fish Called Wanda, The Birdcage, Best in Show, etc.  But, for me, THIS goes to Number 1 (for now anyway).Yes, it grows on you like an untreated fungus.  What I knew in advance of 1st viewing was just that it was supposed to be a funny satire of a ""heavy metal"" band done by actors.  Note that you probably will need several viewings (without interruption) to fully appreciate the humor and to become hooked, but you will love it more and get more out of it with each subsequent viewing.THE PRODUCT(S):  The new VHS tape adds 10 minutes of out-take footage, including the ""Bitch School"" music video.  The new DVD includes an audio overlay for the film itself (ad-libbed, in-character commentary (""defense"") by the 3 principle musicians), about 70 minutes of out-take footage (presented sequentially like the film), a DiBergi update, 4 music videos (excluding Bitch School), other promotional clips, film trailers, advertisements and interviews.  It caused me to buy a DVD player.There is also a 1993 VHS ""Return of Spinal Tap,"" which is a real London sell-out concert from July, 1992, interspersed (approximately every 3 songs) with comedy inserts and interviews; a 4.5 hour bootleg tape of the original movie; 2 real CDs (1984 soundtrack and 1992's Break Like the Wind); a recent book (Spinal Tap Companion by Karl French) with transcripts, lyrics, and other delights; and older materials (laserdiscs, CDRoms, DVDs, VHS) that are out-of-print.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I think one of the secrets to a happy life is the ability to laugh at yourself. Not take yourself too seriously.

"""It's such a fine line between stupid and clever""","""This is Spinal Tap"" is a cult classic and the epitome of 'mockumentary' film-making. We are shown the sights, sounds and smells of fictional band Spinal Tap as they embark on a North American tour that keeps going from bad to worse with poor reception and internal problems.The cast is a pretty good one and the 'band' members (Michael McKean, Christopher Guest & Harry Shearer) actually played their own instruments. Of course, in a film like this you want realism rather than acting prowess and I must say that most of the cast performs well in this regard.The plot (what little of it there is) is filled with humorous escapades and memorable quotes. The humour is often subtle enough that it will fly under the radar of some viewers. As for realism, the fact that so many musicians have remarked on the film's veracity should give an indication of the writers' knowledge of their subject.On the directorial front, Rob Reiner does a good job of fashioning this film like a true documentary. A more polished approach would not have worked nearly as well. When people are confused about whether or not this is a real documentary you know that Reiner has hit his mark. The music is also enjoyable, particularly since it so adroitly imitates the real thing.I recommend this film but for me there's still something missing. There are countless memorable scenes and quotes but the film as a whole lacks cohesiveness and a strong story.

The performances are excellent by the whole cast, including some cameos which I won't mention.

The funniest film ever made?,"This film is just fantastic, that is, if I should call it a film at all. For Rob Reiner's spot-on satire of the rock and roll industry is presented in mock documentary form, so it is really a rockumentary mockumentary.Film director Marty di Bergi (Reiner) decides to make a film which chronicles the ups and downs of his favourite rock band, Britain's own Spinal Tap, who are about to embark upon a comeback tour to promote their new album ""Smell The Glove"" (previous albums included ""Intravenus de Milo""; ""The Gospel According To Spinal Tap"" and ""Shark Sandwich"").  The band consists of five members; Nigel Tufnel, lead guitar (Guest), David St. Hubbins, lead guitar/vocals (McKean), Derek Smalls, bass guitar (Shearer) and the three central characters are backed up by their bizarre keyboard player Viv and there latest drummer Mick Shrimpton.  The film documents how previous drummers met their grisly demise, whether it's choking on vomit (""They can't prove whose vomit it was""), through a bizarre gardening accident or simply exploding on stage (""There was just a little green globule on his drum stool"").Behind the scenes, Tap rely on manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra) who has to organise their concerts (with little success) or deal with unpleasant hotel managers.The band go through a number of different PR stunts to try and promote the album but sales are hindered by the cover.  The original, ""lurid"" cover was deemed sexist (""What's wrong with being sexy?"" Nigel remarked) and so a compromise was reached which saw the album cover being completely black, with no design or logo of any sort on it.  Nigel tried to look on the bright side of the dismal cover (""It's interesting though, because the question is: How much more black could this be and the answer is...none.  None more black..."").  Good-hearted PR man Artie Fufkin tries to organise an album signing which is also met with little success.  The band is beginning to fall apart, little by little and the arrival of David's girlfriend Jeanine is met with annoyance by Nigel, who proceeds to quit the band.  Is this the end of Spinal Tap?  You'll have to watch it and see.In between the vague plot, director di Bergi conducts interviews with the band and at one stage asks them about their reviews - ""The review you had on 'Shark Sandwich', which was just a two word review simply said 'Sh*t Sandwich'"".Of course, we couldn't have a film about rock and roll without the music and we are treated to excerpts from a number of Tap's songs, including ""Tonight I'm Gonna Rock You Tonight"", ""Stonehenge"" (which features the smallest stone henge model you're likely to see - ""The problem was we had a model that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf!""), ""Big Bottom"" and ""Heavy Duty"". There is also the mention of a song we don't actually get to hear, the imaginatively titled ""Reach Out When You Die In My Champagne.""The film is littered with a vast array of scenes and situations that you have probably heard of before; the opening stage pods which don't open, the custom made amps which go up to 11, not 10 (""Well, it's one louder, isn't it?"") and many more, there are too many to mention, really.If this enthusiastic review hasn't convinced you to see it, then I don't know what will, it is just hilarious, especially on numerous viewings, there is a lot you'll not pick up on at first.  The Special Edition DVD release also includes deleted footage and a commentary from the band which is just as funny as the film itself.See it for yourself and see what all I'm talking about and if you already have you'll know what I mean when I say this must be one of the funniest films ever made, perhaps even THE funniest.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Reiner Nails It,"Who would have thought that the meat head from All in the Family would turn out to be such a good director. Norman Lear must have rubbed off during his days on the set of that classic series. Here we have a documentarian, Marty DiBergi(Reiner), following Spinal Tap, a rock band, as they tour to promote their latest album, Smell the Glove. Two childhood buddies, David(Michael McKean) and Nigel(Christopher Guest) are the founders of the group, and they tell Marty of their journey to rock and roll fame. The third man to join them is bass player, Derek (Harry Shearer). The drummers have died in a series of unusual deaths, including spontaneous combustion on stage, and an unexplained gardening accident. The three lead actors are hilarious, and the script, right on target. The funniest moment for me is when Marty is interviewing guitarist Nigel about his amplifier, and the musician explains that his amplifier has a knob which goes to eleven. Asked why not just make eleven the number ten, the rock man looks bewildered, as he says that he sometimes need the higher number for that little extra. The foursome is shown playing to smaller and smaller crowds, as their album tanks. They come up with all kinds of schemes to increase ticket sales. The music is awful, reminding me of Kiss; all stage gimmicks, to cover up a lack of talent. Riner gets it right.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Everyone loves spinal tap ...,"Spinal Tap is one of the most beloved films of all time.  For the hardcore fans, it's probably one of the most repeatedly watched movies ever - people have either never seen this movie, or have seen it a dozen times.  The amazing thing about this movie is the deadpan delivery.  The movie manages to make rock and roll musicians seem almost, well ... not quite normal, but you can't put your finger on what's wrong with them.  There are great cameos by a phenominal range of people, like Billy Crystal and Fran Drescher.  If you like this type of humor, you probably also like some of the early Woody Allen flicks (Sleeper, Take the money and run) and some of the newer mockumentaries like Muffin Man.I have one suggestion for the uninitiated watching for the first time: don't take anything seriously, and watch that volume knob!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
This film goes to 11,"This is Spinal Tap could be the perfect dry comedy. I love dry, satirical comedies and Tap fits the bill with it's perfect execution and believability. From the first 30 seconds of the movie, I knew it was going to be funny. ""David St Hubbins: Lead Guitar.......Nigel Tufnel: Lead Guitar.""  Make no mistake: this film is not for everyone.  The humor is dry and rather satirical, but there is an element of reality to this that you cannot deny. A British rock band with a mediocre fan following at best that inneptly makes its way through the world not knowing their downfalls and smiling stupidly as their entire world collapses around them. Perfect. The whole time you're watching this film you think to yourself, ""do these guys hear what they are saying?! Do they really believe this?! Are they for real!?""Christopher Guest selected the perfect actors for each of the roles and the chemistry (or perfect conflict among the band members) is sublime. Harry Schearer as bassist Derek Smalls has less screen time than I would have liked, but he plays the guy stuck in the middle between Guest (Nigel Tufnel) and McKean (David St. Hubbins) perfectly. The supporting cast is awesome. Rob Reiner, Billy Crystal, Fran Drescher, Angelica Houston, Bruno Kirby, Ed Begley Jr., Paul Shaffer of David Letterman fame and Fred Williard make up the bulk of the supporting cast. You don't assemble a cast like that, each with small roles in the film, without there being an incredible respect and admiration for the project and the man in charge: Christopher Guest.The format of the film as a documentary is very believable. Camera shots really do seem like it's a documentary instead of a feature film. Rob Reiner as the director of the documentary is wonderful. His questioning of the band and their slow-to-respond remarks give you the feeling that this is all spontaneous and not scripted whatsoever. In fact, I've heard from several sources that the majority of the film is ad-libbed or at least the interaction between the band members is all ""wingin' it.""  There's not much of a plotline, but it's supposed to be a documentary so it stays true to form.  However, the roller-coaster ups and downs of the band produce some truly entertaining comedy. In a strange sort of way, you feel for the band members as you laugh at their exploits because you know they'll be the last ones to laugh at themselves.If you have not seen Tap and are a fan of comedies or music, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. If you can get a copy of the DVD to watch, even better. The DVD has TONS of extra features including dozens of deleted scenes that unfortunately had to be cut; these scenes are just as good as the actual film. But, the best feature is the director commentary which places Guest, McKean and Shearer in character commenting on the film. My friend said it best: it's like a whole new movie! The dialogue can range from being directly related to the scene showing at the time to some tangent that lasts 5 minutes about something that has nothing to do with the scene, or even the movie, at all.In short, you don't want this film to end. Spinal Tap is a masterpiece that cannot be recreated, even though Best in Show does a heck of a job trying. Christopher Guest really shows his love of film and music here and that feeling stays with you from the opening credits to the final scene. This is one of my all time favorite movies and I cannot say enough about how well thought out Spinal Tap was and what a wonderfully produced film Christoper Guest created.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

I was wrong. America has muscled in on this territory, and taken the crown.Even if you don't initially sympathise with the 4 characters, as most of the time they're idiots, you will by the end of the film, as they will have entertained you with their total inability to escape from their (each different) severley limited view of the world.

One of the best rock movies ever,"The most confusing thing about Spinal Tap is who they really are. They were treated as a real band, and it all started with a movie. The members of Spinal Tap aren't who they are, yet the immense popularity is all confusing...the actors are all talented musicians (as a matter of fact, Christopher Guest and Michael McKean had worked together before with David ""Squiggy"" Lander, as the Credibilty Gap,and as Lenny and the Squigtones). Michael McKean, one of my very favorite actors, hadn't had this big of a break since the role of Lenny Kosnowski on ""Laverne and Shirley"". Very different roles, yet he was still the same person. It is all a ball of confusion, yet it took off, and the movie was a hit, as well as the songs, written, and performed by the actual actors. With people working on this movie like Rob Reiner, it had to be wonderful, and it is just that. Wonderful. Full of satires, original humor that only could come from these people, and a smash hit musical score, Spinal Tap really rocks!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Age has not withered it. It'll be every bit as funny two decades down the road.,"I think ""Spinal Tap"" is worth seeing roughly once every other year. It remains as fresh, funny, and on-target as ever it was, and there's enough of a foundation to keep it from the sin of fluffiness. Rob Reiner has gone on to other directorial triumphs, and the Guest-McKean-Shearer triumvirate has proven that this film was no fluke with its more recent gems--most lately, ""A Mighty Wind."" The fact that these three are musicians as well as actors and satirists helps to give this film an additionally wonderful insider's perspective. It's hard to believe that there people out there who have yet to experience this one, but they should lose no time in renting or buying it--ideally in the Collector's Edition. Among the more marvelous aspects of the movie are: the great deadpan spoofs of earlier commercial rock genres through that this relentlessly derivative band has passed over its career; the dozens of beautifully realized secondary characters who give the movie a lot of its laughs; and the fact that, despite their terminal stupidity and shallowness, the guys in Spinal Tap emerge as people you--or, anyway, I--feel sorry for when everything seems to be going against them. To me, it's the vestigial underlying humanity of St. Hubbins, Tufnel, and Smalls that makes this movie something more than just a silly spoof. The same can be said, by the way, for ""A Mighty Wind,"" ""Best in Show,"" and ""Waiting for Guffman."" The characters may be more than a little silly, but they remain...well...sort of human, too. I can't wait to see this film again, sometime in 2005.",,Anonymous,Music
A Laugh Riot,"First, classic comedy/rock mockumentary which easily stands the test of time and far surpasses others who have tried to duplicate its style.  This is Spinal Tap is loaded with hilarious quotes and ridiculous situations too numerous to mention.  The cast is so good and so believable that it's downright frightening. Between the mock interviews, the pathetic life on the road scenes and the live performances it's hard to catch a breath between laughs.  No matter how many time I see this film I laugh until I can't breath.  I laugh in anticipation of what I know it coming and I'm laughing right now just thinking about it.  I doubt that a comedy can receive a better recommendation that that.",,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious and yet completely believable.,"I'll always remember the first time I caught This is Spinal Tap running early in the morning on the BBC, over a decade ago when I was still in my early teens. Looking back, the movie left an entirely different impression; not knowing what exactly I was watching, I was convinced that I was viewing a genuine documentary on a big band I had never heard of. The dysfunction, the quarrelling, the pathetic accidents and complaining and the delusion all seemed completely real- there was something humorous about it, sure, but I didn't laugh. It wasn't until I saw it again many years later after hearing about the movie naturally because I was going through my initiation to heavy metal in general. The descriptions from friends were clear enough to know that that was what I had seen all those years ago; but wait, ""It's a comedy?"" I said, unbeknownst of my impending doom. ""Of course it is, you idiot! It's hilarious! I guess you probably thought it was a real documentary too!""Sure enough, I decided to keep that one quiet lest I be subjected to more heckling. Nevertheless, such an embarrassing piece of personal history (and indeed, for many real-life performers who did the exact same thing) remains a testament to both the quality of the film, and indeed its humour, which can easily be misinterpreted as something other than what it actually is; which is, of course, a very thick helping of satire-heavy parody. This style, which was at that point in time rather original and daring, implements a documentary approach that aims to accentuate real human dialogue and dynamics between the stereotypical rock and roll band with its usual clashing of titan egos. As a result, This is Spinal Tap becomes a feature that feels genuine and truly engrossing in its deconstruction of such a lifestyle, but certainly not to the point where all humour is lost. Indeed, there lies a fine line betweenÂ… stupid, and clever, and while director Rob Reiner certainly allows for that line to become blurred during Spinal Tap's final moments of glory, it is done with enough tact and balance to ensure that each element of the feature (humour and character) is maintained with conviction.Despite my history with the film during the last decade of my life however, I sat down and watched it for the third time tonight (which, is actually quite a lot for myself) and found myself laughing out loud for the entire duration. Gone was the quiet awkwardness I felt from that first time, and accentuated was the comical timing of these moments to which brings out that awkwardness but not at expense of killing a joke. Granted, Spinal Tap were still the same whiny pampered rock band I became engrossed with a decade before, but with a little more of an eye for dark wit and satire, This is Spinal Tap opened up and revealed itself as a hilarious and yet completely believable take on superstardom in all its deluded pretence and downright hysterical eccentricities.Part of what makes the experience such a joy in the first place however is through the performances of the main cast and their commitment to making a feature which up until that point, had only been flirted with. Ten years earlier, This is Spinal Tap had me convinced that I had just seen a real documentary; the same cannot be said after my most recent viewing, but this is only because of prior knowledge. Aesthetically, Spinal Tap would lay the ground work for many similar mockumentary movies and TV shows hoping to use the style as an ultra-realist way of portraying the petty nuances of human relations for humorous effect. The ensemble, who essentially took notes from a script and ad-libbed the rest, nail the balance between being convincing and grounded without losing their naÃ¯ve rock-star appeal and stature; this style in turn elicits a strong comical presence within the actors' performances whilst making them compelling, dynamic individuals able to reaffirm the movie's mockumentary approach. Not only does it allow for Spinal Tap to engross in its story/document, but it creates characters that feel alive, and thus, we too feel their embarrassment and ridicule.To go into any real depth as to why Reiner's movie strikes the chords that it does, seems at least a little disconnected and arbitrary to the actual experience of watching the film itself however. That being said, taken from a purely analytical and critical viewpoint, This is Spinal Tap nevertheless stands firmly as a mostly flawless, concise hour and a half of comedy with real personality and distinction. Yet a movie such as this shouldn't and couldn't be digested properly under the illusion that you're watching for a perfect, fulfilling experience filled with the highest calibre of drama or writing. No, instead, This is Spinal Tap exists as a tribute to cinema that feels natural, gets the job done, and does it without resorting to tired clichÃ©s and dull, repeated ideas. It's a masterpiece in its own rights, providing laughter with memorable characters and situations that leave you laughing long after the punch lines have evaporated. Most of all however, is that it's just downright fun and yet strangely human; indeed, just as you think that you've heard a beautiful, heart-felt melody inspired by works of masters, you'll soon be enlightened to know it's actually a piece by Mach, entitled Lick my Love Pump.That, ladies and gentlemen, is Spinal TarpÂ… direct from hell.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Music
As long as I have the sex & drugs...I can do without rock & roll.,"This is one of those films that you can pick up different little subtleties with each consecutive viewing (I would say `The In-Laws' and `Dr. Strangelove' also fall within this class). I first saw Tap perform the hilarious `Christmas with the Devil' on Saturday Night Live around 1984 or so. As much as I liked that appearance, I didn't find this film particularly funny on my first viewing. Having seen this about - oh let's see - at least four times each year for the past 15 years, how is it that I've never, until just recently, noticed David's response to the argument over their latest album cover? Listen closely and you'll hear this:David: `If we had said, 'yes, she should be forced to smell the glove,' then you'd have a point. But it's all just a joke, isn't it? We're making fun of that sort of thing!'Nigel: `Well, she should be forced to smell the glove'David: `Yeah, but just not over and over again.'Or how about when Duke Fame's manager played by Howard Hessman dismissively tells the band `we'd really love to stand around and talk, but we've gotta get to the lobby and wait for our limo.'Brilliant! Can I just lay some praise upon Christopher Guest's for a moment? I realize that he wasn't the only brainchild behind this comedy masterpiece, but he has got to be one the most amazing character actors/improv comedians around. He virtually disappears into the parts he plays, hardly resembling one character to the next. Ironically, his actual personal demeanor is extraordinarily mundane and dry - almost faceless in light of the performances he gives. His ensemble films of late (`Waiting for Guffman,' `Best In Show') - yes, mark my word! - are destined to be fondly remembered as comedy classics unto themselves in the years to come. His distinctive improvisation/mockumentary approach (seen in its infancy in `Spinal Tap') is reaching near-perfection at this point, and I can only hope that it continues with the remarkable line-up of players he has assembled over the years.Funny, I actually had the opportunity to see Spinal Tap live in 1991 (1990?) while in Milwaukee and they were actually a lot better than many - if not most, come to think of it - legitimate bands I've seen over the years. They hilariously spoofed such clichÃ©s as the unplugged set, the gimmicky guitar solo, and the flying/superhero rock star (Nigel on uncooperative wires during the `Tonight (I'm Gonna Rock You)' opener). The boys all played their own instruments and handled their own vocals (natch), which begs the question: how much of a fake band is this anyway? Clearly, those who know the world they're spoofing the best are the ones most capable of writing the most effective satire.As the Spinal Tap legacy has continued, the lines between art and reality have become blurred in some of the strangest & most creative, enjoyable ways. For those looking to delve deeper into the expanding farce, I suggest listening to commentary track on the DVD. It features Guest, McKean and Shearer as Spinal Tap giving their misguided take on the documentary they, surprisingly, found to be a `hatchet job' by filmmaker Marti DiBergi (Rob Reiner, by the way, poking fun at Scorsesse's presence in `The Last Waltz'). Among the other notables clearly chided: Van Halen, The Rolling Stones, Jethro Tull, Yoko Ono, The Troggs, Led Zeppelin and Kiss.  As I said earlier, maybe you've gotta know this territory to play along with the gags. I would hate to think a movie this good would require such knowledge, but after reading some of the negative IMDB reviews I have to wonder.",,Anonymous,Music
"This film is funny, very funny!","You can study an analyze this film as much as you want, but when it comes down to it is a bloody funny movie. There are possibly more funny moments in this film than in any film since ""Life Of Brian"". All the main characters are extremely well acted, and they manage to pull the British accents and mannerisms off perfectly. Even the humour seems to have a very British feel.Standouts include, the amps which go to 11, Nigel's hilarious guitar solo, the 18 inch Stonehenge(""in danger of being crushed by a dwarf""), the band being forced to perform Derek's freeform jazz number (""Jazz Odyssey"") after Nigel quits, David's Yoko like girlfriend, Derek getting trapped in the pod which won't open, and the band getting lost on the way to the stage.To top it all off the songs are actually pretty good, as well as being very funny.

None More Funny.,"The question is: how much more funny can Spinal Tap be? And the answer is none. None more funny. 'This Is Spinal Tap' is a 'rockumentary', if you will, was directed by Rob Reiner. Much of this film was ad-libbed, and several dozen hours of footage were shot before Reiner edited it down to the released film. The first time you watch the film, you will not notice everything. By the second or third time, you start to notice how some of the characters burst out laughing, and struggle to get back into character. In my opinion, it was the funniest movie ever made. Reiner appears as Marty DiBergi, the maker of the documentary, and films the band's 'Smell The Glove' North American tour. The film mocks the arrogance, ignorance, sexist, stupidity, and egotistical nature of heavy metal bands trying to sound smarter than they really are. The album review scene was one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life. The made-up Spinal Tap album covers were pure comedic brilliance. As it turns out, many of the band' mishaps actually occurred to real-life bands, which makes it even funnier, so there is a sense of truth to the film. The film notes early on that Spinal Tap Â— ""One of England's Loudest Bands"" Â— have had a succession of drummers, all of whom have died under odd circumstances, one in a ""bizarre gardening accident"". (Since the film's release, Toto's drummer Jeff Porcaro actually died in a gardening-related accident.) Another of Spinal Tap's drummers ""choked on vomit"", specifically someone else's vomit (several musicians have died after choking on their own vomit, notably guitarist Jimi Hendrix, drummer John Bonham of Led Zeppelin, and Bon Scott, the original singer of AC/DC); and one drummer seems to have fallen prey to spontaneous human combustion. This run on drummers was a nod towards several bands; both John Bonham and Keith Moon had died years before, while Judas Priest were, for a variety of reasons, on their seventh drummer at the time of the film's release. However, the main inspiration for the running joke is the supposed curse on keyboard players for the Grateful Dead. Black Sabbath had a cross stage production design that was done in inches rather than feet, parodied by the Stonehenge monument in the film. Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers got completely lost on the way to the stage. The lyrics to Spinal Tap's songs are probably some of the funniest things ever written to date. All fans are in agreement that 'Spinal Tap Mark III' should be made, and everyone is in anticipation for it. If I were to write the screenplayÂ…it would probably look something like this:MARTIN DI BERGI: Let's talk about some of your more recent reviews for a bit. The review of 'The Number Of The Geek': ""Most of the songs fall well below the mediocre territory. None will be hits. The title track, 'The Number Of The Geek', for example, meanders pointlessly through a snooze-fest chorus that encourages track skipping. Tap is an average band with below average songs. I don't see where this album has any true market or future. It is a candidate for the worst release of 2006.""David ST. HUBBINS Is average better than mediocre?DEREK SMALLS Average is way better than mediocre. It's even better than medieval.MARTIN DI BERGI The review you had on 'Surgeon Killer': ""Surprisingly, the album is on track to only sell between 100,000 and 200,000 copies in its first week. What isn't surprising is that the album is complete crap.""MARTIN DI BERGI RegardingÂ…'Vanilla Platypus And The Poop Flavored Coffee"": ""This album is a full sided lobotomy of old style Disney tunes. Why are Spinal Tap's CD sales plummeting year after year? It's not because iTunes is so much better; it's because some of the album titles were so retarded we were ashamed to be overheard asking for them.""",,Anonymous,Music

"Directed by Rob Reiner, This is Spinal Tap is a `r...","Directed by Rob Reiner, This is Spinal Tap is a `rock'umentary of the fictional European heavy metal band Spinal Tap.  The film pokes fun at the numerous stereotypes of heavy metal `hair bands'.  Dubbed as the world's loudest band, with amplifiers set to 11, Spinal Tap embarks on their first U.S. tour in years.  During this period Marti DeBergi follows the band making his documentary.  The scenes throughout the movie vary from interviews and concerts with the band, to the backstage and offstage life of its members.  The band was formed by guitarists and vocalists David St. Hubbins and Nigel Tufnel.  Oddly, they began as an upbeat pop band, which is portrayed as a Beatles-like group.  They eventually decided to take on the genre of rock and roll and, after many name changes, settled on the name Spinal Tap.  The film makes fun of the ever-changing lineups of modern rock groups, having all of Spinal Tap's past drummers need to be replaced due to odd deaths such as a freak gardening accident, choking on vomit, and on stage spontaneous combustion.  During scenes of concert footage of the band, we are treated to their satirical lyrics of songs such as Big Bottom, Hell Hole, and Sex Farm Woman.  In a likely not too far off exaggeration of real rock bands, Spinal Tap argues constantly about practically everything.  At one point manager Ian Faith quits after a long argument with the band and David's girlfriend over the miniature Stonehenge prop on stage.  During a concert soon to follow, Nigel walks off and quits in the middle of the show. Eventually the band reforms for its tour in Japan, but ultimately stays on its downhill path.  The satire and realistic feel to this film makes it a classic comedy.",,Anonymous,Music
Goes all the way to 11,"As if this film needs another glowing review...This is a quite brilliant satirical rockumentary of ""Spinal Tap"", acclaimed as the ""loudest band in Britain"". Quite an honour.The best thing about this film is the fact that although it is evident to the viewer that the band is not very talented, original, intelligent or popular, the members of the band are completely oblivious to this fact and those around them seem too polite to actually point this out at any stage. Still, lack of talent, originality and intelligence need never hold one back in rock'n'roll, and teenage boys will listen to any old junk, so that's popularity taken care of. Watching stuff up after stuff up and the consequential blame game is throughly enjoyable.As a satire, this comes from the top shelf, as good as The Simpsons, Canada's The Newsroom, England's Knowing Me Knowing You and Australia's Frontline. It covers all the bases - Yoko Ono, weird spiritualism, motel room trashing, album cover controversy, even choking on vomit - with aplomb, courtesy of the fact that Tap are so throughly derivative that you can pretty much have them doing every rock'n'roll cliche in the book. Some of the impact has been lost with time - there were a lot more bands like Tap around in 1984 - but the humour is far from obscure. You could do a very similar script today taking off boy bands or rap.The DVD is one of the most feature heavy you'll find. Even the main menu is funny. The commentary on the film by the band is as funny as the original soundtrack, as they vent about how they were betrayed by Martin Debergi and who is now dead as opposed to being the head of a record company. There's almost as many scenes cut out of the original as there were scenes in the original.You cannot claim to be a fan of satirical comedy until you have seen this film. Go out and rent it.",,Anonymous,Music
SUPERB MOCKUMENTARY!,"This is hilirious! Michael Mckean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer taking the mickey out of all those heavy metal bands! There is some damn funny scenes in this excellent, inventive comedy. Nigel Tufnel is so dumb that he's just hilirious to watch! There are too many funny parts in this movie to even start mentioning! Just buy this 'rock mockumentary' and enjoy all the scenes that are perfectly executed and the jokes and double-meanings simply cackle with invention and freshness even when watching it now some 17 years later. Amazingly articulately cast throughout, every character just shines with the humour throughout the movie. When watching the movie, you even start to believe it's actually a real band and genuine documentary! If you wanna real light-hearted laugh at the music world then buy this! Amazing!",,Anonymous,Music
My love gun's loaded and she's in my sights...,"I am of the belief that Christopher Guest is a genius, and ""This is Spinal Tap"" is probably the best example of that. It's full of quotables-all I've got to do is look at my significant other and say, ""He's the patron saint of quality footwear"" or, ""We're not going to do f-ing Stonehenge!"" and we collapse in hysteria. Rob Reiner also made a lot of good movies after his days of playing the Meathead were over, and I've always missed him in other Guest productions. Also,the music in this film is actually pretty good; if you don't listen too closely to the lyrics and ignore the titles, you might almost think you were listening to a bona fide band! This was the first of the genre for Guest, although I'm willing to bet ""A Mighty Wind"" will probably be the last. Although still very, very funny, it had kind of lost it's ""quirky"" appeal by that time.",,Anonymous,Music

Funny regardless of your music tastes.,"I did not get old enough to follow popular culture or music at all until well after the height of pretentious metal rock bands, though a few ""stragglers"" still played on my first radio. That didn't prevent me from enjoying the hilarious comedy one bit, however. I'm certain I missed a good many in-jokes surrounding the metal culture, but there were still so many funny things to see and hear that this ranks as one of the funnier comedies I've seen.  Particularly amusing was lead guitarist Nigel's major misunderstanding of giving written dimensions after he laughs at the lead singer's girlfriend's lack of musical recording knowledge.The film will probably feel dated to some today who were never exposed at all to this period of musical history. The songs the band performs (which are all quite hilarious send ups of macho metal) are not that shocking by today's much more lurid standards.  This does not, however, take away anything from the excellent performances given by the entire cast (numerous cameos included).  The main characters manage to be stereotypical musicians without being caricatures, and the looks on their faces at the latest technical glitch or cancelled show are always entirely believable.I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good comedy or some biting satire on the supposed profundity of popular culture, music fan or not.",,Anonymous,Music

I took my wife to see it on the screen and she did not laugh as well.  I have a tough time convincing her that this is the funniest movie ever made.

Hilarious... a classic,"I just picked this up on DVD from the library and it's every bit as funny as I remembered.  The creators of this film understood a great deal about the history of rock music and expertly weave this knowledge into the film.Many times the actors' accents in other ""serious"" films tend to come and go... in Spinal Tap I never once heard one of the leads break accent. Perhaps the funniest thing about the film is the songs themselves, with their ridiculous lyrics that are still within a stone's throw of what actual heavy metal bands used to sing (and somewhere are still singing.)The film is a little short at around 80 minutes, but compared to the cinema bloat that is currently en vogue, maybe that's not so bad.

To make it even more breathtaking, there are certainly live performances, curated both on a scenographic and musical level. A cult to see absolutely, also recommended the soundtrack of the work signed by the app Spinal Tap.",,Anonymous,Music
Quite literally the best film ever made,"It's a shame not all of Rob Rieners films were as good as this.  Spinal Tap has a script that was written to perfection.  There are so many quotes from this film that have people rolling around in hysterics yet the humour is always subtle and very dry.  Every time I see this movie I find something I haven't seen or heard before.  It took me three viewings to spot Billy Crystal!

Miniature,"As far as comedies go you may find wrier stuff; but few that is wry about being dumb and vacuous but spirited for that. This is a cult film by now, especially in heavy metal circles. It's a better kind of fun, being able to laugh at yourself or how you viewed the world at one point.These people feel they matter, even though the music is mid-tempo chugging such as as was dime a dozen in 80's metal, the lyrics dumb - here deliberately over-the-top - but passing themselves as commentary, and the fans feel they matter; but we know they don't.The mockumentary tropes have been copied everywhere since, but they still work better than most here. They key is this godsend gift of the British; balance between where the joke begins and where the rest of the surrounding world is polite enough to let unfold.There is no scatological confrontation such as we find in Hollywood; everything is offered and accepted - jokes about vomit, sexism, dead drummers - with a kind of stoic grace. These people are brainless but endearing.This is why the wrap-around is so marvelous and has endured so well. We get a film that taps into the lives of people who feel they have tapped into the lives of people, who perceive themselves at the center of the world yet are continuously baffled to realize they revolve in some obscure periphery and no one cares. Their song about Stonehenge, full of dumb self-important musings about druids and ancient mystery, is confounded by a tiny Stonehenge prop; the ridicule literally descends on stage from above, the laughter here divine.It is a loving - never fully cynical, cold, mocking - affect though, that we may recognize from our own small efforts to matter in the grand scheme.

A MUST SEE.",,Anonymous,Music
"Incredible, funniest movie I have ever seen.","From the beginning to the end, this movie is brilliantly constructed. The start in medias res of the group's waning popularity, the internal struggle which almost destroys them, and their reunion and ascent back into popularity are crafted to perfection. Good things do happen to good people, and the band members remain so obliviously optimistic in the face of inevitable failure throughout that we cannot help but love them.In this film, ALL questions are answered: the band manager, who slaves away for Spinal Tap, is finally appreciated and respected; David and Nigel's friendship prevails over Janine, the would-be destroyer of the group; and Derek, too easy-going to worry or complain, remains ""somewhere in the middle [of Fire and Ice], sort of like lukewarm water."" The mocumentary reveals the true souls of the musicians through ballads like ""Lick my Love Pump"" and lyrics like ""my baby fits me like a skin tuxedo, I love to sink her with my pink torpedo"" and ""big bottom, talk about mud-flaps, my girls got 'em"". Even social issues such as drugs (""well I'm sure I'd be more upset right now if I wasn't so heavily sedated""), racism (""Well, we don't literally say 'love your brother'; we don't even literally mean it. But we're anything but racist"") and sexism (""well it is and it isn't; she should be made to smell the glove, just... you know... not repeatedly"") are tackled and resolved.""The dials go up to 11"" in this flick, where ""you can't dust for vomit"" and freak gardening accidents are ""best left unsolved"". Films like ""Rock Star"" will never achieve this level of wit or popularity; what Stephen Herek and John Stockwell fail to realize is that it takes more than marketing gimmicks for a film to stick - it takes intelligence, a department in which the two of them are quite evidently and quite worryingly lacking. In the end, there is a fine line between clever and stupid, and this movie is so funny that, it's like, how much funnier could a movie be, and the answer... is none.",,Anonymous,Music

Every line its perfectly believable.This movie is commonly labelled a ""cult classic"", which is a shame, because it is one of the great comedies of all time. The dialogue is absolutely brilliant.

"First and Best of The ""Mockumentaries""","This is the finest example of this genre and should be enshrined as the ""how to"" in its field.  Some of the impact has been lost over the years due to the television skits and shows that have made use of its innovation, but it should be viewed with fresh eyes considering its place in film history.I saw this film when it was shown in theaters in 1984.  At the time, it was one of the most inventive, original and funny films I had ever paid to see. Mind you, this was well before the more popular advent of VHS and the proliferation of films on that medium.This is the first of the documentary-style comedies that followed and certainly the best of the bunch.  ""Waiting for Guffman"", ""Best in Show"" and ""A Mighty Wind"" are the children of this film and all share a similar vein of humor, however, this film having been the first gains it considerable advantages over the others.This is Rob Reiner's first foray into feature film directing and it was a remarkable start.  The situational humor, as well as the improvised history and dialogue is simply priceless.  Throughout the film (and this is particularly true considering the time when it debuted) there is a sense of realism that never lets up, which enhances the comedic elements of what occurs and what is said.  His own performance (particularly in the opening) is as masterful as those by the rest of the actors in the film.Anyone who has seen a ""behind the scenes"" film about any rock band would need to see this before any other ""mockumentary"", as it truly captures many of the working elements of a musical group, as well as the sillier aspects of how performers can view themselves and their place in their industry.I should balance this review by saying that I saw it with a girlfriend who was only 20 years of age at the time.  She didn't get some of the humor and thought that many of the situations were too uncomfortable and ""real"" seeming to be able to laugh at them.  Fortunately, she was among a remarkable minority in the audience that evening, as the theater erupted with laughter over many of the lines which have now become classics.Please watch and enjoy this film - place it in context for its time and allow yourself to ""peek in"" on the lives of the ""World's Loudest Band""!",,Anonymous,Music
Hours of enjoyment!,"Spinal Tap isn't a movie for everybody.  If you don't know much about rock music, you will probably think it is just a very shallow movie with a few gags here and there.  However, if you are a fan of rock music, you can spend hours marveling and laughing at layer upon layer of innuendo, satire, and subtext.McKean, Guest, and Shearer, all very talented musicians in their own right, knew their rock history and accordingly parodied aspects of just about about every major band from the early 60's to the 80's.  It is so packed with jokes that it would be impossible to pick up on all of the jokes the first time around.Besides the rockers themselves, it also pokes fun at groupies, managers, the record industry, and even spontaneous combustion.  If that doesn't make a good natured comedy I don't know what would.If you have any knowledge of rock and roll, see this movie!

This Is Hilarious,"This Is Spinal Tap (1984) - Documentary-style spoof of a faded, aging British heavy metal group touring America that have overstayed their welcome. The comic adventures of this group are so well-crafted that when I first saw this I assumed this actually was a real band. Instead the mostly improvised comedy of Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer not only provide side-splittingly funny moments but also make a skewering social commentary on the various ridiculous quirks of the rock and roll industry that tend to be overlooked. I don't want to spoil any of the moments, but the scenes with Nigel Tufnel's guitar collection and the 'Smell the Glove' album are classic. Hilarious movie, go out of your way to see this. The DVD audiocommentary and deleted scenes are almost as good as the movie itself. 10/10",,Anonymous,Music
Strong recommendation of this movie to anyone,"This Is Spinal Tap is arguably one of the funniest movies of the last thirty years.  I have seen it at least twenty or thirty times and have found something new in it with each viewing.  Reiner, Guest, Shearer, and McKean did a phenomenal job writing and acting the movie.  The fact that the actors honed their musical skills to actually BE THE BAND and play and write all of the music speaks volumes for their commitment to this masterpiece.  Movie and music fans who are ""in the know"" still quote lines from Spinal Tap to this day.  (i.e. ""Hello Cleveland"", ""This one goes to eleven"", etc) I have a son named Nigel and I sometimes jokingly tell people that he is named after the lead guitarist from Spinal Tap.  People who do not ""get"" this movie should try harder because it is one of those movies that just  gets better over time.",,Anonymous,Music
Still Going,"A friend dragged me to see this shortly after its cinema release and then, several years later, I showed it to a foreign friend on VHS. When the video store guy suggested it to me recently, I nodded, agreed and saw it again on DVD (with all the extras and Reiner's gray beard).This film still works for me and based on comments, it works for others too - even those who have discovered it in the DVD version.Good fun.

This movie goes to 11,"What does it say about Rock and Roll when a group of comics and actors can get together and make a servicable but mediocre rock band that fools more than a few people?I dunno, I just know that ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is very funny because of that ""It's as if they are a real band"" feeling.This film perfectly captures the pampered pomposity that many rock stars have. The conviction that they are creating something""important"" beyond agreeable entertainment. It also captures the proud sexism in the songs and the desperation in hanging on to the ""success lightning"" that was captured in their bottle for a time.The movie captures this through on target comedy.I love Rock and Roll, but have no illusions, Rock and Roll at it's purest is not ""Important"" or ""relevant"".

The Finest Movie Ever Made About A Band That Never Was,"There have been many directors before Rob Reiner (Orson Welles immediately comes to mind), who could never break the curse of having made a brilliant debut with their initial directorial efforts. Depending on your world-view, you could say that since the release of ""Tap,"" Reiner has become a seasoned, respected and prolific craftsman of some of the finest films that American cinema has to offer, or you could think of him as the cheesiest of Hollywood hack cheeseball sellouts.But diehard fans and despondent detractors have to agree on one thing: THIS IS SPINAL TAP still stands today as the best example of American comic satire ever done, especially about its particular subject. It is to rock and roll what MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL was to Arthurian mythology, and has so embedded itself into the lexicon of popular culture, that it has raised ire from the very bands it pokes fun at, and has even garnered a devoted cult of loyal fans worldwide who never 'got' the punchline: THE BAND DOESN'T EXIST!!From bands like The Beatles and The Stones, to heavy metal mavens and hair bands like Def Leppard, Ratt, Black Sabbath, Poison and Metallica, no one is spared. And I think what really distinguishes ""Tap"" from similar movies that have been made since, the satirists responsible realized when they conceived it, that you have to have a genuine affection for the subject you are skewering. Which, ten years-plus after its initial release, still shows through in every performance and every line, scripted or ad-libbed.By now, if you know anything about rock, be it classic or contemporary, you have to have had some brush with the character archetypes so accurately portrayed here: Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer, all SNL alumni from that show's glory days, play lead singer/lead guitarist ""David St. Hubbins,"" co-lead singer/lead guitarist ""Nigel Tufnel"" and bassist/backing vocalist ""Derek Smalls,"" respectively.Erstwhile documentarian and bottom-rung commercial director Martin DiBergi (Reiner) jumped at the chance to film every sight, sound and smell of the latest tour of Tap, the band that shaped the director's whole outlook about music, especially rock and roll. What he captured during that period is the stuff that, cutting-edge back in its heyday, can now be seen every week on shows like VH1's BEHIND THE MUSIC or THE E!TRUE HOLLYWOOD STORY. Today's bands have not only managed to pattern themselves after Tap, but with all of their pomposity, egotism and displays of infantile sexuality and arrested emotional development in word, deed and song, they have surpassed them!The newly restored version should go into the very next time capsule that the Smithsonian or any similar organization decides to assemble. Like HOLY GRAIL, it only gets better and funnier with repeated viewings. Has success spoiled Rob Reiner? That depends on who you're talking to, but even the passage of time will never destroy or diminish his first and best work.",,Anonymous,Music
"I give it an ""11""","THIS IS SPINAL TAP is an almost perfect satire, in that it mocks everything about the music business, but is still lovingly realistic in the details. Heavy metal is a perfect target for satire, because there are few things where the line between stupid and clever is any thinner. Example: the line (from ""Big Bottom"")--""my baby fits me like a flesh tuxedo; I'd like to sink her with my pink torpedo"" is stupid enough to be funny, but could easily fit into the lyrics of any of the hair bands of the 80's.

Not only was it utterly brillent, but it was something that had never been done before: the fake documentry or the mochumentry if you will. This Rob Riner film (which by the was mostly improvised) changed the way we think about comedy and heavy metal.So the plot of ""This Is Spinal Tap"" is that this director makes a documentry about this band named Spinal Tap. There starting there tour of the States named ""Smell the Glove"" (named after there new album). To say it doesn't go well would be a extreme understatement. To find out why, you have to see the film.Spinal Tap is a pure treasure, one that will stand the test of time, I would recommend this film to head bangers and belly busters everywhere.",,Anonymous,Music
