"By its very making, director Steven Spielberg has written the greatest obituary for one of the greatest leaders of the modern world.","The very mention of a Steven Spielberg project and everyone goes bug-eyed in excitement and curiosity; everyone from casual movie goers to mainstream critics to cinema house managers. Now reunite Spielberg with long standing producing partner Kathleen Kennedy, throw in a multi-award winning star cast lead by Daniel Day-Lewis and a story about one of the most revered Presidents in US history and you have an Academy Award nominated movie by default. Lincoln has all these fine qualities and a whole lot more. This is not just a great film for the reasons stated above, or because it is very easy to praise a film directed by Spielberg. This is also not just a masterpiece or a very important and powerful film for the sake of calling it so. From the drawing boards to its last take, Lincoln is every bit exquisitely fashioned filmmaking — an amalgamation of art, literature, politics, society, history, and most importantly, humanism.Here's a brief re-cap to get you up to speed on the relevance of the American Civil War (1861 to 1865) as depicted in the film. The United States of America is divided as cotton rich states of the South refuse to phase out slavery. After Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln secures the Presidency, almost a dozen states in the South pull out of the 'Union' and become the Confederate States of America. As a bloody civil war rages between North and South, the film's story begins with President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation. This is the Commander and Chief of the armed forces calling for slavery to be abolished in all states by seeking a landmark constitutional amendment. For this to happen, Lincoln must procure enough votes through Congress for a stay order on making slavery illegal anywhere in America. Challenged with factions within his Republican party, Lincoln becomes his own worst enemy in a daunting personal crisis: save thousands of lives by ending the war or prolong the war in favour of ending slavery.Running at 150 minutes, this film is a slow burner with extensive dialogues and frequent courthouse debates; but like the trudging power of a steam locomotive, Lincoln pushes forward with remarkable pace while never losing sight of its destination. Piloting this powerhouse of a film is Daniel Day-Lewis in easily his finest hour as a method actor. His Lincoln is tall and bent over with war-stressed fatigue and a shrill voice, but armed with a quiver full of wisdom and remedial anecdotes for when push comes to shove. Throughout the narrative Lincoln is torn within as he manages his duties as the President of a nation, as a father who has lost a son, and as a husband who must confide in his wife when decisions become complex. This is also when I must mention Sally Field in another fine delivery as First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln and the epitome of the phrase 'Behind every great man is a woman'. Field's Mary is a tragic character whose depiction of a bleeding heart is memorable in a scene where she confronts Lincoln as the father of their children, not a man with immense power. With strong characterisation forming the flesh and blood of the film, you can also expect riveting roles from Tommy Lee Jones and David Strathairn, besides a multitude of top actors.This is one of the most important films of the year and perhaps even the times we live in. By its very making, Spielberg has written the greatest obituary for one of the greatest leaders of the modern world. Lincoln is to Steven Spielberg what Gandhi is to Richard Attenborough; the commonality being crucial moments in history, rather than a history lesson per se. If I have to nit-pick, I suspect there could be historical anomalies in the narrative if this film is solely considered a biopic. This is why I strongly recommend the film as a political drama rather than a componential biography. Is it safe to say that President Abraham Lincoln was a self-made man? That he was extremely intelligent despite dropping out of school? That he changed the future of an entire nation? That Barak Obama is the current President of the United States of America because Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery? If you said 'yes' to any of these questions then Lincoln is more than just an Academy Award magnet—it is a landmark film made by people reiterating that freedom is a birth right for people everywhere.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Moving and important...with a mind-blowing performance by Day-Lewis,"Lincoln (2012)A highly polished, restrained, important movie.That doesn't make this an exciting movie. The acting is terrific, and filming excellent (including a color saturation pulled back to give it an old look without seeming affected). It is clearly expert in the way we expect from Steven Spielberg above perhaps anyone, at least in the mainstream conventional sense.But there are two things that make this movie a must see. One is the content. It's about one of the two or three most important things ever to happen in this country--the fight to end slavery during the Civil War. This is such powerful stuff it will make you weep. (If it doesn't, you'll have to ask why.) It's laid out as clearly and emphatically as possible while still keeping accurate.The second thing is simply the overwhelming performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It is so good you forget it's a performance (unlike, for example, his intensity in ""There Will Be Blood"" which stood out as a work of acting above the movie). Here he is so woven into the fabric of things he is indistinguishable from the historic truth, somehow. It's really the magic of the transparency of movie-making of this kind. Amazing performance.It seems sacrilege to say this but the movie isn't perfect. Because of its material--getting the anti-slavery amendment through Congress--it involves a lot of talk, and a lot of people that you have to keep track of. I think Spielberg did this as good as it could be done, so no criticism there, but it does mean a lack of physical and even emotional drama through much of the film. I don't mean it's dull, just that it's conversational. I also found shreds of Spielberg's Frank Capra quality of making the movies--and his subjects--a little simplified. He ties up loose ends. He makes it all a fine package, very fine. Maybe too fine for what I would call high art. At times.I think we'll have an easier time judging it in six months, or six years. Also the subject matter makes it almost unassailable, since clearly most of us are all for the passing of any anti-slavery legislation.See this for all the reasons you have heard. Don't miss it. Maybe down a coffee before you go, but see it no matter what. As I say, it's important. It reminds you of greatness, and that's not something to miss.UPDATE over one year later: I see that I accepted a lot of decisions by the writer and director as their prerogative, like focussing on one issue and narrowing to a short period of time. I had no bones with the scope of the movie. But in retrospect I see how the limitations of time and scope and background also create a sense of mis-information. That is, if you want a bigger picture of Lincoln, this movie is not quite right. Its aggrandizement is also not unavoidable, like the somewhat insipid (and yet moving) recital of the Gettysburg Address at the beginning by soldiers. Overall, though, I stick to my main thought--see it, and soak up what you can, without expecting perfection. Yes, see it for what it is, nothing less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
...and the Academy Award for Best Actor goes to....Daniel Day Lewis!,"Directed by Steven Spielberg. Starring Daniel Day Lewis, Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field. Written by Tony Kusher and Doris Kearns Goodwin.""I am the president of the United States of America, clothed in immense power! You will procure me those votes!""'As the Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield and as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.'Steven Spielberg has done it again! It seems like the older he gets, the better his films are! I was very satisfied with his efforts, particularly the set designs and tone. It was a joy to watch. I was not impressed with the cinematography efforts. It was well done but nothing stood out for me. For instance, Scorsese seems to bring a new camera angle/shot/position in every one of his films. I was expecting more.The acting was this film's strongest aspect. Daniel Day Lewis brings an historic performance to the screen except I didn't see him in this picture. I saw Abraham Lincoln. He was so driven into the character, at times it was scary. Lewis' vision of Lincoln is self confident, calm and patient. It was in my favorite scene that his patience finally wore thin on his colleagues about the negativity in the 13th amendment. The mannerisms were spot on. His efforts match my personal favored work of his in 'My Left Foot'. His best contribution to the picture was consistency. Throughout, he never faltered. His accent never trailed off and his actions were always precise. He is fully deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor. Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field also gave great performances. They brought character and charisma to the picture. I particularly enjoyed the Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field combination. They compliment each other very well. My only criticism of the cast is that there were too many actors. At times, the characters were defined with a tag on the bottom of the screen. I don't enjoy being told in letters who the characters are. I want the character to show me in action who they are.The Score is very well done in this movie. The team of Spielberg and Williams never fails. The music brings just as much emotion to the screen as the actors do. It helps bring the vision and atmosphere to life.This film isn't what I would call a 'masterpiece' but it was a joy to watch. A must see and one of the best films of 2012.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Truly a masterful performance by Day-Lewis,"My husband and I are a little odd in that we tend to gravitate towards certain actors and follow their work, as opposed to just looking for a movie to watch. We've done that with all of Daniel Day-Lewis's films and for the most part, have never been let down.He's at the top of his game here. This is is crowning achievement. Besides doing a silly goofy comedy where he has to be completely relaxed and making fun of himself, I think he could do anything. But having said that, that is probably what he will conquer next. You really can't throw a challenge at him that he can't field. He became not just the president of the United States, but arguably the most iconic and certainly the most caricatured of them all. But he did it in as much of an authentic way as he could have.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Daniel Day Lewis Factor,"I remember fondly, Henry Fonda and Raymond Massey as Lincolns in ""Young Mr.Lincoln"" and ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" They gave remarkable performances. But, here and now in this extraordinary Steven Spielberg/Tony Kushner version, the illusion is complete. I was watching the president and not for a moment thought of the actor. That in itself is close to unique. I left the theater with the feeling I've just had an out of body experience. Everything around the central performance - and I call it a performance because I don't know what else to call it - falls into place in a miraculous way. The photography, the production design, the wardrobe made it possible to actually smell the period. Congratulations and thank you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"The political process tangles with ""Honest"" Abe.","""He contained multitudes."" Walt WhitmanA story about Abraham Lincoln's 13th Amendment fight could be a snoozer in the hands of anyone else except director Steven Spielberg and actor Daniel Day-Lewis. Together they bring alive the passage of one of the nineteenth century's greatest pieces of legislation, freeing slaves for all time.While the Civil War was coming to a close after 4 bloody years in 1865, Lincoln politicked for the amendment's passage, knowing full well that if peace were obtained, the impetus for the amendment would vanish. So politics and war are inextricably tied together, and arguably the most noble American president bartered and lied his way to passage.Spielberg makes clear that sequestering the South's negotiating team until passage was crucial, if not impeachable. The drama as votes are bought or cajoled is an apt companion to the catastrophic war that cost over a half million lives. Less rewarding as drama is Lincoln's relationship with his wife, Mary (Sally Field), whose depression over the loss of her first child stalks here her lifetime and makes for some less than sweet moments on screen.But this film belongs to Lincoln, who, as memorably portrayed by Day-Lewis, is a leader of strong will peppered by a sense of humor and a relentless penchant for tales: The story of George Washington's portrait in a British water closet is a hoot. Tommy Lee Jones' Thaddeus Stevens is essential Jones: gruff, blunt, ugly, and charismatic with a dollop of kindness no better exemplified than in his final scene in his bedroom.Although this is occasionally a heavy-handed history lesson, it is my preferred way to learn. I know now what the 13th Amendment is, and I am aware in our own time of the severity of politics-- that great leaders must also be great politicians, with all the pejorative connotations our recent presidential election can conjure. Steven Spielberg brilliantly shows us that the process can be for the people and by the people and may not perish.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Abraham Lincoln deserved a better film,"'Lincoln' is one of the bigger favorites for Oscar Awards this year and will certainly be one of the heroes of the evening in Hollywood a few weeks from now. It is made by one of the greatest directors of our time, it tells a big American story and features a big American hero, it enjoys some fine acting and is very accurate in searching into history and retrieving a moment and a story that continues to impact the American social and political fabric until today. And yet, 'Lincoln' did not turn to me into a cinema experience to enjoy. Actually something interesting happens with my relation with Steven Spielberg. The film I liked most is one of his first – the very little known Duel, a minimalistic masterpiece, followed by the wonderful Close Encounters  and E.T. I enjoyed the Indiana Jones and The Jurassic Park series for what they are meant to be – great entertainment. However my personal experience with his 'serious stuff' is mixed. While Saving Private Ryan is for me the best war film ever made, and Schindler's List is one of the best in the Holocaust genre, other stuff looks sometimes pretentious, sometimes too naive. As much as he tries to prove, Spielberg cannot do films about any subject, I mean he certainly can, but not all are that good.Most of the action in 'Lincoln' takes place during the month of January of 1865. After four years of Civil War victory is quite close for the North, but the ending would have been meaningful only if the 13th Amendment making slavery illegal was adopted, making the reason of going to war and the temporary judicial war decisions part of the Constitution. Timing is critical, as the nation is tired and aspires for peace and recovery, and without the adoption of the amendment the end of the war may mean a compromise that leaves slavery in place. Abraham Lincoln will make all possible political maneuvering in order to have the amendment pass, in a Congress where he did not have the required majority. There is an interesting dilemma here about using 'unclean' political means in order to achieve a just cause and this is one of the principal themes. There are two problems here however in my opinion. One is that the political intrigues occupy a good half if not more of the film, and what we get on the screen is a painfully long succession of bearded gentlemen under top hats arguing and bribing for the good cause. I guess some of the American audiences are more familiar with the historical characters, but even so this is a long and repetitive succession of more of the same, and even the climax scene of the voting in the House misses some of the thrill I have expected. The other problem is the political speak which is attributed to almost all characters in the film. Maybe the script writers used fragments from speeches, I do not know, but there is too much rhetoric, too many historical sentences are being said by many characters (not only by Lincoln) and even in what should have been day-to-day situations. The overall result seemed to me tiring and emphatic. It is actually the non-political secondary threads that seemed more interesting – for example the agonizing decision of the parents Lincoln not allowing their elder son to fight in the war. This dilemma would have deserved a film by itself, a smaller but maybe better one.Much was said and written (even a cover story in TIME Magazine) about Daniel Day-Lewis's impersonation of Lincoln. He is good but far in my opinion from his own creation in 'My Left Foot' or from Joaquin Phoenix's act in 'The Master' (best acting of the year in my view). The way he is filmed does not help, too many frames are looking towards catching his silhouette or making his profile look like the pictures which represent Lincoln in his time. Again, when he is human, when his words are not taken from speeches he looks and sounds better, but this is only for part of the time. Rhetoric prevailed in the building of this role, and Spielberg's scope looks like creating as many scenes to quote, but less to link them in a fluent story as he knows to do that well. I liked much more the supporting roles of Sally Field as a Lincoln's wife, or maybe the wife of all presidents or great men who sacrifice their personal lives for the greater causes, and of Tommy Lee Jones as the radical pro-abolitionist politician Thaddeus Stevens, a man whose life was dedicated to the fight against slavery, but who knows to make the right political move at the critical moment to achieve the legal confirmation of the dream, at a tough personal price with respect to his own ideals. In a movie where so many characters including the one that gives the name of the film are no more than rhetoric symbols, these two living heroes played by the two great actors make a refreshing difference.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"It would really help to have read ""A Team of Rivals"" before watching this...","... as many of the details about the personalities and machinations involved are clearly explained in that book.Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln,"" released in 2012, stands as a masterful exploration of one of America's most revered leaders during a pivotal moment in history. Centered on the final months of Abraham Lincoln's presidency, the film delves deeply into the complexities of politics and personalities involved in the passing of the Thirteenth Amendment.At its heart, Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of Abraham Lincoln is nothing short of extraordinary. Day-Lewis embodies Lincoln with a mesmerizing authenticity, capturing not only his physical presence but also his mannerisms and profound intellect. His performance humanizes Lincoln, showing his wit, compassion, and the burden of leadership during the Civil War.The screenplay by Tony Kushner is a standout feature, drawing from Doris Kearns Goodwin's book ""Team of Rivals"" to craft a narrative that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant. The film focuses on Lincoln's strategic efforts to pass the Thirteenth Amendment, which would abolish slavery, amidst the tumultuous political landscape of the time. Kushner's script is rich in dialogue, filled with eloquence and historical depth, providing viewers with a window into the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by Lincoln and his contemporaries.Spielberg's direction is deft and restrained, allowing the performances and the weight of history to take center stage. The cinematography and production design evoke the atmosphere of the 1860s with meticulous attention to detail, from the elaborate period costumes to the meticulously recreated settings of Washington, D. C.Supporting performances by Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln, Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, and David Strathairn as William Seward, among others, are uniformly excellent, adding layers of complexity to the narrative and enhancing the film's emotional impact.""Lincoln"" is not just a biographical drama but a profound meditation on power, justice, and the enduring struggle for equality. It resonates deeply with contemporary issues while reminding us of the moral imperatives that shaped America's history. By focusing on Lincoln's personal and political struggles, Spielberg and his team have crafted a film that is both enlightening and deeply moving, offering audiences a powerful and thought-provoking cinematic experience.""Lincoln"" is a triumph of filmmaking, anchored by Daniel Day-Lewis's transformative performance and Spielberg's assured direction. It stands as a testament to the enduring relevance of Abraham Lincoln's legacy and remains a landmark in historical cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Oscar-worthy performances all around,"Once again a fine proof of Steven Spielberg's love and respect for historical dramas, and of his ability to pull them off with dignity and grace. Lincoln, telling the tale of President Abraham Lincoln's attempts to dissolve slavery during the Civil War, is certainly admiring in tone, but not so much that it becomes ridiculous. It paints Lincoln as a man of higher morals, larger than life, but yet it acknowledges his humanity and the everyday side of his life. It shows us both his grandeur and insuperable ability to lead as well as his good humour and problems with his family.Large part of that is thanks to Daniel Day-Lewis, whose Oscar was certainly well-earned. The man disappears into his role and I have no problems imagining that the actual man himself might have been something like we see here on the silver screen. He especially excels in the scenes that show the joviality of Lincoln, showcasing a man that's above all else wise and beloved. At times his performance comes across as a touch absentminded, which I'm not convinced is intentional, but it doesn't detract from the whole all that much.The rest of the cast is equally talented, with special mention going to Tommy Lee Jones playing the part of Thaddeus Stevens. On the technical side of things the film has no flaws. Everything from costuming to cinematography works as intended, which is no surprise given the director, but the films is all about the characters and there I have absolutely no complaints.Lincoln is a good film, borderline great even. Its skill and talent will win you over and its message is one worth hearing. It's a shame it didn't win more Oscars, because it would have deserved them.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Interesting film, but definitely not the the definitive version that someone has yet to make.","Story focuses on the passing of the Emancipation Proclamation and does not give the viewer a robust sense of who Lincoln was - where he came from, his difficult journey to the White House, etc. The film is very ""heady"" in that it deals with a continuity of ideas, dialogs, debates, etc. leading up to the passing of the proclamation. I sensed that I was watching a filmed play rather than having a cinematic experience. Very little screen time was given to any sort of visual storytelling. I felt cheated in that regard, but that being said, it was an interesting experience and seemed to have historic authenticity. I found it as entertaining as a great university lecture.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A capsule of a great president and a director's increasing maturity,"Daniel Day-Lewis is something of an unsung miracle; the man will come out of nowhere, select an unlikely role, knock it out of the park, then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.Spielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.While titled ""Lincoln,"" we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.One requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.With this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.But that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.Starring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

Sigh. Daniel does it again,"I'm prepared to admit at this point that Daniel Day Lewis has succeeded to the title of most brilliant actor of his generation--and I do not say that lightly. But when I consider what he has done here--imbued the most sacred president in our history with such aching, gorgeous, complex humanity--seemingly without conscious effort on his part--I say give it to him.His Lincoln is at once ordinary and divine, passionate and all too earthy...and he inhabits the role so fully that not beyond the first minute do you think to yourself that you are watching an actor and not the man himself. I admit, at the first speech, I rather expected the voice to be deeper and more commanding, but that wore off instantly, and Spielberg to his credit gets every scene note-perfect. The scene where soldiers on the field were quoting back to him the Gettysburg Address was heartbreaking--The big guns, to be sure, but everyone in the theater stopped breathing. Spielberg has the mood and light fine-tuned to the point that when the characters are donning shawls against the cold--this in the white house--you shiver. I can'think of a single actor who was not up to snuff, but James Spader as a rascally vote procurer stands out. Sally Field as the troubled Mary Todd Lincoln is a sympathetic gem, and her portrayal should go a long way towards explaining and perhaps inviting history's revision of that unhappy woman. The film focuses most on the nuts and bolts of legislative and presidential processes, and while that may be boring for some,it has such a ring of authenticity and research that it had me scrambling for the history books to check on things I hadn't known. This is the most difficult of all subjects to film, a dense scholarly work translated to popular culture, but it succeeds on all counts. See it, make your children go with you.

And Day-Lewis and the rest should, because they have all the space to show their talent. The whole movie is one slow theater play; it lacks everything that is needed for the rating it gets on IMDb and from critics.

Spielberg Delivers A Dialogue Driven Yet Riveting Biopic,Most people will be aware that Steven Spielbergs filmography can be split into to two categories Action Adventures and Real Life Dramas and Lincoln falls into the latter categories but that's no disservice to the film as I think this is a fantastic film with amazing performances and a riveting story. When you boil it down the thing that are going to make or break this movie are the performances and they all work especially Daniel Day-Lewis who gives one of the best performances I have ever seen he embodies everything that Abraham Lincoln stood for and delivers a performance that is impossible not to get behind and it is easy to tell that the set backs in what he is trying to accomplish are taking a toll on him. Tommy Lee Jones also killed it in this movie I loved every second of his screen time he just seemed like an alternative version of Lincoln. Every thing Lincoln could be if he showed no restraint. The story of this movie is done in a very compelling way just do using in Lincolns last few months in office bringing the story into focus. James Spader was also extremely entertaining in this movie I loved his entire sub-plot of trying to get votes for the amendment and truly stole every scene he was in (except from any scene he had with Day-Lewis). Spielberg directs the film in a way to ensures that the audience is never bored and he doesn't do it in a lazy way by cutting the camera constantly he ensures that something visually interesting is always happening on screen. However my only flaw with this movie is the fact that we never truly saw with our own eyes what Lincoln was fighting for we never see slaves suffering and begging for freedom in fact most of the slaves seen in the movie are treated reasonably well. Of course I understand why one would want to end slavery I just think I would have made for some more compelling scenes in the film.Lincoln is one of my favourite Steven Spielberg movies with amazing performance and a compelling and riveting story.A-91%,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I walked out of the theater wanting to go back in and see it again.,"It's seldom that I leave a movie knowing that I absolutely will go back to a theater to see that movie again rather than wait for distribution. As I walked out, I absolutely knew that I would be back. There are so many amazing actors in this movie that I need to go back to fully appreciate the story.In my estimation, Spielberg's Lincoln will become the definitive movie on Abraham Lincoln. Daniel Day Lewis absolutely disappeared into this character and out gallumped Honest Abe - country lawyer, gifted orator and a man born more fully suited to the desperate needs of a nation than possibly any other man in history. This movie is not the shiny myth, but a portrait of an amazing man who inspired, cajoled and even bribed the Representatives of the People into representing ALL of the people.If you go, and I hope that you do, go with ears ready to hear voices speaking out to us from our violent past, telling us that we can be better than we are, that some things should be done because they must be done and that we can sometimes accomplish the impossible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Well Told, Educationally Relevant, and Oscar Deserved","For a movie that was a long time in the writing and forming, this film hit the ground running with brilliance. I am an Australian and was captivated in an educational wave of united states history. I learned a lot through this movie. The acting line up and dramatisation skills were excellent. I can see how Day-Lewis won the Oscar for best actor. There were a couple random pop ups of well known actors that showed their faces for a few moments. Tommy Lee Jones was exceptional as usual. The cinematic work done in this film was well structured and presented to portray certain emotional scenes. There was a lot of effort and skill that went into this movie and I applaud the workers. It truly captivates you in one of the biggest law changes of history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
awful and dull,"When i knew sometime ago that Spielberg was making a film about Lincoln i thought that it would be great to watch a film of one of the best filmmakers about one of the greatest men in history.I was totally wrong.This is not a film about Lincoln, this is a film about the 13th amendment of the constitution of USA, and everything in it is dull and slow.It is very painful to be watching 2 and a half hour of something that it could be told maybe in 1 just hour or less in a documentary, and for people interested in the 13th amendment of the USA constitution not in Lincoln itself.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"great film, interesting reviews","Before I write my review, I'd like to note some of reviews I read on this board.Some (not all obviously) people reviewing this film were bored by it, and some thought Daniel Day-Lewis was okay. Just okay.We've really gotten to the point where if one has to listen to what is considered too much dialogue (probably a page's worth in a total script would be too much), the film is slow and boring. If we don't see things blown up and crashed every ten seconds, there's just no action.What a dull, dull tale, the story of a great President as he pushes for the passing of the 13th amendment to abolish slavery and end the Civil War. A big yawn. Not enough bloody Civil War scenes, I guess, and then we're deprived of a big ending too.""Lincoln"" is a reverent look at a historical figure, not just as a historical figure, but as a man with children and with a volatile wife, a man who played politics just as they're played today in order to get his way.As far as Daniel Day-Lewis, let me say that not for one second did I think I was watching a performance. I was, in fact, watching Abraham Lincoln, just like when Helen Mirren played Queen Elizabeth, I was watching Queen Elizabeth. It is a rare, rare actor that can work that magic. As brilliant as Meryl Streep was in some sections of ""The Iron Lady,"" there were other times when it was an impersonation, not the woman.I found this a brilliant and important film, meticulous in its detail and research, right down to the ticking of Lincoln's watch. A man who cares enough to have the actual watch that belonged to Lincoln heard ticking is a caring and committed director.Sally Field fought for this role, and she is brilliant. As Thaddeus Stevens, Tommy Lee Jones is wonderful, and the whole cast is great: James Spader, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Walton Goggins, etc. - all brilliant and well cast.I have one criticism, brought out by another reviewer - after 2-1/2 hours, why was the assassination not depicted? This to me is one flaw, though I'm sure if I actually spoke to Spielberg, he could convince me of his reasoning.As some side trivia, Tad Lincoln died at around age 18; Robert Lincoln lived until 1925, dying at the age of 82. He had two children; the Lincoln line died out in 1985.A monumental film that deserves to be seen and studied.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""Lincoln"" & Daniel Day Lewis Incredible.. Warning:not an action film","Just read some of the ""bad"" reviews & simply just don't get how you can't like this GREAT MOVIE. Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" was AWESOME. The Director was able to take you ""Back In Time"" when things were much simpler & primitive, way back in the 1860's. And Daniel Day Lewis moved me in this film like no other actor has ever done. Mr. Lewis' performance was mesmerizing and spellbinding. He was ""Abraham Lincoln."" His acting in this movie is definitely ""Best Actor/Academy Award Worthy.""Lincoln"" was not directed or produced with the main intention to deliver an Action ""Civil"" War Movie concentrating on horrific action battle scenes. If you want mainly entertaining action scenes then James Bond & ""Skyfall"" should be your pick. I'm sure it is also an awesome film. I want to see ""Skyfall"" also. But ""Lincoln"" was my first pick of the holiday blockbuster season.Stephen Spielberg, designed this Movie to specifically concentrate on ""The Man"" Abraham Lincoln: Our 16th President of the United States. And how Mr. Lincoln helped end the CIVIL WAR and at the same time Abolish Slavery in our United States of America in the last few but Very Important months of this Great Man's Life. Daniel Day-Lewis helped show the truly human sides of Abraham Lincoln.I Admire and Honor Abraham Lincoln even more so after viewing this Film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
My rating: 7,"Extremely important issue, extremely great victory of man against man, of mankind. A key moment in world history that is able to push the opportunity to make a movie on it in the background.It's really hard to show the drama and significance of the event. Even the director and main character, I think, failed to do it. Same spinning all the time, the end was clear even before the start. On top of all was the emphasis on the fact that with immoral methods you can achieve moral outcomes.My assessment of the film is so high!, because of the importance of the subject, Daniel Day-Lewis (from his previous films) and Spielberg. He, just because of his name, lately I can not find his interesting films, especially I mean War of the Worlds.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An Incredible History Lesson!,"For those of you who do not enjoy history or politics, I wouldn't watch this film. But for once, there is a historically accurate and rather entertaining film based on one of the greatest Presidents of the United States, Abraham Lincoln. This film will take you behind the scenes and in the mind of ""Honest Abe"" as he tries to pass the Thirteenth Amendment in Congress. This film is beautiful film in many regards. It has blissful cinematography, a subtle but great score by John Williams, great direction by Steven Spielberg, and just top-notch, amazing acting.Spielberg directed a story about Abe which focused mainly in the last few months of his life. As the Civil War drags on, there is a battle between Lincoln's 13th Amendment which will end slavery and Democrats in Congress who are supporting the end of the war and not the bill.The one thing that carries a film like this is the acting and everyone puts on an acting clinic here. Let's start with Daniel-Day Lewis, the greatest actor of our generation. The passion he brings to each project is amazing and because of Daniel, we see what kind of man Abe was. I want to say this is his best role, but every role he's done, they just been so amazing. All I can say is that he deserves his Oscar for this film. Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens is wonderful and another great performance. Sally Field brings emotional depth as Mary Todd Lincoln in her amazing performance. We get good performances from Joseph-Gordon Levitt, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, James Spader, and so on. Such a wonderful cast assembled for this film.Overall, Lincoln is a politically-rich film, but we see the man Abe was as he was always telling stories, no matter his stress. He was a man with a sharp tongue and always had a plan. We see the fragile complexion of Mary Todd as she cares for her family. This is a passion project by Spielberg and through his direction of the film, we can tell. For those of you expecting action, don't watch this. It's very political and there are lots of a dialog, some which may seem dry. But, I was hooked on to every single word. This film brings emotion to the film and if this was not a movie, Lewis would be a perfect Lincoln. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Stunning Production & Faultless Performances in Long Slow Wordy Film,"The makeup and period hairstyles, mustaches, and beards on the countless male actors in Steven Spielberg's two-and-a-half hour ""Lincoln"" are so meticulous that the characters seem to step from 19th-century daguerreotypes. However, what is high praise for the legions of hairdressers and makeup artists that labored on the film, the comment underscores a wandering interest from the slow, often ponderous proceedings on screen. The film's technical aspects are beyond reproach; from Janusz Kaminiski's atmospheric cinematography that evokes the gaslight era to Rick Carter's detailed production design of Civil War Washington, ""Lincoln"" has been crafted with care and skill.The large cast of veteran actors equals the film's physical accomplishments. Led and perhaps inspired by Daniel Day-Lewis, who inhabits the role of Lincoln as no one has done before, the performers are credible and often outstanding. Not since ""Forrest Gump"" has Sally Field had a role like Mary Lincoln; although excellent throughout, Field has one spectacular scene that could clinch her a third Oscar and further proof ""that we really like her."" Playing congressmen, politicians, cabinet members, and generals, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, James Spader, John Hawkes, Jackie Earle Haley, Tim Blake Nelson and others ably fill the outstanding cast. Strangely though for a film about emancipation, few African-Americans have important roles.However, despite superb technical credits and an inspired cast that boasts Oscar-worthy performances, ""Lincoln"" plods on with words, words, words, and little action beyond afternoon sunlight filtering through lace curtains. While the film recovers afterward, an opening scene that features soldiers reciting the Gettysburg Address to Lincoln is corny and unconvincing, and a number of scenes have ""important"" rubber-stamped all over them. Perhaps die-hard Civil War buffs will relish the verbal sparring, but a lame attempt to create suspense during voting on the 13th amendment fails, largely because the outcome was revealed in elementary school American History texts. However, Spielberg often creates memorable images: Grant tipping his hat to Lee at the Appomattox surrender, amputated limbs tossed into a muddy pit, a clean new Stars and Stripes passing a soiled tattered Stars and Bars that flutters over a quiet battlefield littered with thousands of dead soldiers. ""Lincoln"" is a film of countless elegiac moments, faultless technical credits, and award-worthy performances; unfortunately, an old adage applies, and the whole is less than the sum of its parts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Daniel DL + Spielberg = reach perfection !,"This is my first review of a film. I had to do this, because of the effect it had on me. I went to see a screening of ""Lincoln"" last week, and i was wondering if Spielberg could have done it again, like he did years ago with ""Schindler's List"", for example. And he did it, that's for sure. That's not ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", not even close, but this film captures wonderfully the way the director looks at that piece of history, and though it's probably not the more realistic film ever made about Lincoln (and i don't know if there will ever be one really realistic..), the movie offers tremendous performances (DDL will certainly be honored), a tremendous production design and, not less important,a great score by John Williams, once again! So,basically, i was, still, very surprised by the way Spielberg did it, because it shows a very intimate portrait of Lincoln's personality. And i warn you, this is film is for grown ups, not for teenagers looking for some kind of action war movie about leadership and honor in civil war. That's Spielberg in a kind of different but always faith full way, and i hope it earns lot of nominations in the Oscars this year, and i will not be surprised if Lincoln wins Best Picture in January.A 10/10, without any doubt ! :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Patient and engaging while mostly avoiding sentimentality,"I approached this film with caution and did so for several reasons. First and foremost, this is Oscars season and this type of film is just what one expects to come out and be showered with Oscar buzz – and quite often these films are found to be lacking once they are out of this period and on their own. The second reason was related and it was that I didn't for a second think that this film would be able to go for more than two minutes without the heroic music coming up, a soft focus being slapped on the lens and someone giving a great speech about the morality of everything while the camera cuts to those around looking teary eyed and yet full of admiration. In other words I worried that this would simply be a more expensive version of The West Wing season 1.Although the film does rather fall into these traps occasionally, it is by no means seriously flawed since the majority of the film is patience and very well delivered. We focus on the final few years of Lincoln's life, specifically the period towards the end of the war where slavery was abolished by Constitutional amendment. As such the film is about political wrangling and the determination to stay the course with the goal even though it would be difficult and smart politics suggested to not risk the bigger prize (peace) at the expense of an aspiration. The film shows this very well and it manages to be patient without being slow – which is quite the achievement considering that the film is essentially men in rooms talking. The politicking was well delivered so that it wasn't dull but wasn't falsely sped up. The sentimentality is kept to a surprisingly low. It is still there of course and the camera frequently looks for a heroic frame and the music often reminds us the grandeur of what we are seeing, but it doesn't overdo it too much and certainly nowhere near the levels I feared.Day Lewis is perhaps a given for the Oscar. His Lincoln is certainly a spot on creation – he comes over as heroic and steadfast without being mythicalised by his own performance. He really gives an impression of the man's spirit throughout the film. The supporting cast is so deep in names and faces that it is hard to know where to start; being honest, at times I did find it a little distracting as a parade came across the screen – seemingly all from TV shows I watch or films I had seen, I suspect I could be quite far down the cast list before I found someone I couldn't place. Aside from this distracting a little, it does mean the cast is deep in talent and everyone does well. Tommy Lee Jones in particular adds passion and color to all his scenes and the film benefits from his performance. Field is perhaps not as good – although in fairness I didn't think the personal side to the story worked as well as the rest – and since this is her parts, maybe that is why I didn't like her performance as much. Spielberg's direction is very well paced; shots are very well picked and the camera is very patient in its movement.Lincoln didn't blow me away but it did quietly impress me. Part of the reason for this is that the film doesn't go all out for emotion or history or sentimentality, it simply lets it happen in the main and manages to keep these traps to a comparative minimum that really helps the film. It is long but never boring, respectful but never overly so.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
History and Resonance !,"This is a brilliant film by Mr. Spielberg that speaks of man's best and worst. He has presented these themes to us before and our hearts, minds and souls are better for it. The useless loss of war, the ideals of freedom and equality are common themes but never better embodied than here in this portrait of Lincoln starring Daniel Day Lewis in one of his most natural and poignant performances. With an engaging script by Tony Kushner and superlative performances by all, this movie draws a concise picture of 19th century America and the issues that have resonated throughout history and around the world. The view offered is not a grandiose heroic tableaux but a heartfelt human vision that embraces tragedy, justice and the need to heal a nation. Through Mr. Spielberg's artfully subtle direction we witness a war and a fight in government that reveals a man with a keen sense of humor, human nature and justice. It revisits this nations key and pivotal issues of freedom, justice and equality under the law for all. Sally Fields in one of her most compelling roles should surely be considered for an Oscar as well as Gloria Ruben and James Spader. With it's evocative setting, moving score, and perfect casting this is a film that is not to be missed. Excellent !",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Day-Lewis anchors this straightforward but moving historical drama,"Abraham Lincoln. Steven Spielberg. Daniel Day-Lewis. Any of these words alone commands a lot of attention and respect; put them together, and you have an almost inconceivable amount of reverence. ""Lincoln"" is reminiscent of the powerhouse Oscar biopics of the '90s and early 2000s, but unlike other recent biopics, it mostly measures up to the hype.I say mostly, because as good as ""Lincoln"" is, the tendency will be to exaggerate it because of the subject matter and talent on hand. The film deserves plenty of praise, but it operates on the level of what you see is what you get. It lacks of the obscured themes and subtleties of more recent Oscar-winning fair, but the ""old-school Oscars"" nostalgia it evokes will assure that it sees a good degree of accolades.The rock at the film's center isn't Spielberg, but rather Day-Lewis. The two-time Oscar winner known for waiting for, finding, securing and delivering unforgettable leading roles as though he knows something no one else in his profession does, will disappoint no one except those hoping to see another incarnation of Daniel Plainview from ""There Will Be Blood."" Day-Lewis' ""Lincoln"" is calm, reserved yet every bit as commanding of the screen as Plainview. Day-Lewis knows everyone's eyes will be on him, so he dials his performance down in a way that makes him even more prominent, while also reflective of an older Lincoln who is used to the ""fame"" and concerned most about his legacy.""Lincoln"" takes place in the final four months of the president's life starting two months after his reelection (January of 1865) and concluding with his assassination. So no, it's not a traditional biopic, rather it shows Lincoln at a specific time in his life. You could also say the focus is less on Lincoln and more on passage of the 13th Amendment, which might've been a more appropriate (though less Oscar-baiting) title.The even greater context is the Civil War, which is turning undoubtedly in the Union's favor at this point in time, but with the body count mounting, Lincoln faces pressure to end it by any means possible. One of those means is the 13th Amendment, which would abolish slavery if passed in the House of Representatives, but Conservatives believe a peace agreement might be reached faster. Realizing peace talks/the Confederacy's surrender could happen sooner than later and derail any chance for the passage of the amendment, Lincoln, along with Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn) puts all his muscle into winning over enough congressmen to secure the necessary two-thirds majority vote.Writer Tony Kushner (""Angels in America"") keeps things straightforward in a film that could get lost in the intricacies Washington politics. Consequently, ""Lincoln"" is a rather accessible film, yet also a bit heavy-handed. Especially at the beginning, characters speak in rather detailed terms about, for example, the two-thirds majority vote, opting for clarity rather than authenticity of speech.The script also paints Lincoln as a storyteller quick to snuff out verbal conflict with a good tale or two, usually ending in a humorous punchline. We get a good portrait of Lincoln's personality in this way, though hardly a complex one. The complexity comes in with the subplot involving his relationship to wife Mary Todd (Sally Field), specifically in regards to their two (living) children, Tad (Gulliver McGrath) and Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Mary Todd gets a rather one-dimensional portrait. She's clever, but ultimately defined by how traumatized she was when their son Willie died of illness a few years prior. Field has the gravitas to hold down the part well, but it's far less interesting than the focus of passing the amendment in the main narrative.""Lincoln"" has its greatest degree of modern relevance in terms of how he had to secretly ""buy"" the votes of several moderates in the House. He promised jobs rather than uglier bribes such as money, but considering today's issues with nepotism, it's an interesting parallel, especially when you consider that this ""dirty work"" was done to achieve something so fundamental as securing liberty for an entire race of people. You can't exactly blame him for using whatever tactics he could.Outside of the man in the tall hat himself, Oscar winner Tommy Lee Jones should and will get noticed by awards bodies for portraying radical Republican congressman Thaddeus Stevens, who throws about some legendary (albeit archaic) insults at his Democratic opposers. He's more than just comic relief however, as he gets a pretty substantial and well-rounded subplot that tests his character as well as Jones' ability.A number of other talents show up or play integral supporting roles in the film, but chalk that up to every actor demanding their agent get them a part in the Spielberg film about Lincoln. Parts played by Gordon-Levitt, John Hawkes, James Spader, Michael Stuhlbarg, Jared Harris, Hal Holbrook, Jackie Earle Haley and more could've as easily been played by unknowns, though they all do lend some extra legitimacy to the film as far as it being an event drama.Also adding in this regard is all the top-notch technical work. Spielberg always has the best crews on hand for his films and ""Lincoln"" has an incredible visual color palette and the dignified look of a truly important historical drama. His camera is slow-moving and subtle so as to allow us to soak up Day-Lewis' performance and all the intriguing drama. He also knows a thing or two about emotional catharsis, and while the scene in which the House votes on the amendment won't bring you to tears, it's still so darn moving — you feel as though you are truly witnessing history.""Lincoln"" doesn't offer many surprises, but considering how thoroughly it handles politics and captures important themes about doing what's right in such a pure way, history teachers will show it in class for years to come.Thanks for reading! moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Disappointment. But Daniel-Day Lewis is Great,"I really wanted to love ""Lincoln."" I was hoping for a biopic that would be both intimate and spectacular. I wanted the film to sweep me away and bring me close to an historical figure in the way that ""A Man for All Seasons"" allowed audiences to feel close to Sir Thomas More, or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" created an unforgettable impression of T. E. Lawrence. I was hoping at least for a film as good as John Ford's ""Young Mr. Lincoln.""Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" felt more like an educational docudrama than a gripping feature film. Daniel Day-Lewis, though, gives a commanding performance as Lincoln. You should see the film. It is good. It's just not anywhere near good enough.It's hard to believe that Steven Spielberg, one of the most successful and influential Hollywood directors of all time, could have made a film so plodding and wooden. Scriptwriter Tony Kushner is a Pulitzer-prize winner. I would have to guess that Mr. Kushner did not win that prize for crafting gripping, dramatic scripts charged with dramatic tension and driven by character-revealing plot.The film is entitled ""Lincoln"" but it would be more aptly titled ""The Passing of the 13th Amendment Outlawing Slavery."" This shift of focus may have been done to make the film ""relevant.""It's a high school English class truism that the main character of a story is the one who changes. Abraham Lincoln does not change in this film. In many scenes, he feels like a statue in the corner. Lincoln deputizes WN Bilbo (James Spader) to hustle up the necessary votes. Spader is terrific as Bilbo, and he almost steals the movie. It's Bilbo who is moving and shaking. Lincoln just hangs back and comes out with a quip or bon mot or folksy, homespun tale or spooky prophetic dream every now and then. Heck, the animatronic Lincoln at Disneyland could do everything that Spielberg and Kushner allow their Lincoln to do.Sally Field is too old to play Mary Todd Lincoln, who was in her forties at the time, with a young son. In her every scene, all I kept thinking was, ""So, how is Sally Field doing as Mary Todd Lincoln?"" I was never able to forget that it was Field I was looking at, never able to escape the fact that I was watching a film rather than being immersed in a story.Many of the actors seem to have a hard time delivering Kushner's lengthy sentences. There is a scene where Mary Todd Lincoln is, in a long-winded manner, telling off Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones) at a formal dinner, and it is so stiff it feels like a high school production. Daniel Day-Lewis never has this problem with the dialogue.David Strathairn is terrific as William Seward, Lincoln's secretary of state. He and DDL are utterly convincing in their scenes together. You really get a sense that these are two political partners with differing styles who are struggling as best they can toward a common goal – ending slavery. At one point Lincoln grievously disappoints Seward, and he dismisses Seward by remarking, ""Time is a great thickener of things."" Seward's response is priceless. The movie comes to life at that moment. It is depicting a vital but trouble relationship, how that relationship vents its anger, how it heals its wounds, how it struggles onward toward a hoped-for goal. If more time had been devoted to Lincoln and Seward's relationship, ""Lincoln"" would have been a better film.Tommy Lee Jones delivers the biting insults of Thaddeus Stevens, Pennsylvania congressman and chairman of the House Ways and Means committee. Stevens' insults, and his ridiculous wig, and Tommy Lee Jones' persona and voice, are so striking that Stevens almost becomes a caricature. He bellows that another house member is a reptile too low to step upon. The film doesn't get beyond that. It doesn't bring us into the mind of a white man courageous enough to battle slavery. There is a great, brave, brief scene where Lincoln and Stevens speak face-to-face and one-on-one. Stevens talks about his contempt for the common man. How could such a contemptuous person fight for human dignity? It's a conundrum the film doesn't plumb. Lincoln responds to Stevens with a terrific metaphor about compasses and swamps. Again, if there had been more of this kind of intelligent, challenging, and focused dialogue, this would have been a better film.My major disappointment with this film is that it didn't bring me any closer to Lincoln. There is something about Lincoln that defies the limitations of his time and place, and, therefore, understanding of him. He is truly larger than life. In the many photos of him, we see a compelling but inaccessible man. His features, with their marked facial asymmetry, grip and confound us – they invite, and resist, intimacy. He married a woman rumored to be mad. He was rumored to be a homosexual. He was martyred on Good Friday and it is said he haunts the White House. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance made me feel close to Lincoln, but the plot and direction didn't support that. I left disappointed.The production values are lavish. Scenes are chock-a-block with authentic, accurate, books, costumes, boot buckles, mustache combs, clay jugs, corsets, wallpaper. You almost get a whiff of the stale air of a museum. I look forward to watching the extra-feature-packed DVD that will include a chart with little arrows pointing to each object and offering its provenance, age, and construction materials.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Near-Great Movie And The Best Of The Year,"Ignore the bad reviews and the lesser ratings given this picture. This is out-and-out a great, great film (even though it gets one or two details wrong - like the way Connecticut voted on the bill in question), with many great cameos and performances by some of the greatest actors of our day - not to mention the work of one of our greatest directors and movie minds ever, Stephen Spielberg.Daniel Day Lewis (as Lincoln) is brilliant here - as are Tommy Lee Jones (as Sen. Stevens), Sally Field (as Mary Lincoln), David Strathairn (as William Seward) and many other fine actors - in bringing an important but little-told part of history to life, with all of its many colors and nuances.And here's a side of Lincoln we haven't seen before - Lincoln the impatient and demanding power-broker. When he wanted to get something done, he wanted it done, it seems - and he knew how to get it done (even if it took some scheming to accomplish what he wanted to achieve). Mary's active role in the Lincoln Administration is also brought to life here in a way you don't see in other films. (In most other films, all they do with Mary is portray her growing madness, just one side of the picture.)This movie is the work of heavyweights and deserves recognition for its greatness. What an accomplishment! And it makes you feel like you were right there, at a pivotal and intense time in this nation's history, with much at stake. If you want to see what a great President looks like, look no further.Finally, this movie achieves a quality level rarely seen in modern films and you absolutely need to see it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Let's be honest about this film,"Let's set aside the big Hollywood names acting in and directing this film, forget about its big budget, even forget about the seriousness of the topic. What are we left with, looked at just as a film?For a start, it's very narrow in its content, focused entirely on how Lincoln got enough votes to get his anti-slavery amendment passed. That's all. Despite the grandness of the title ""Lincoln,"" it's only about Lincoln in this one small, if important, moment of his career, covering in considerable detail how he rounded up the required votes, how he pressured certain politicians, horse-traded with others, cajoled, tried to inspire, tried everything he could think of to get the votes needed to pass the constitutional amendment outlawing slavery. There are no subplots other than a little to-and-fro with his wife and some brief scenes showing his sons--mere gestures rather than subplots. The film is all about the down-and-not-always-clean vote- gathering business of politics. Once the bill is passed, the film quickly comes to its close, with a few short scenes to bring the war to an end and Lincoln to his assassination.There are very few outdoor scenes. Almost everything happens indoors. The characters are seldom shown other than in their roles as professional politicians. There are no beautiful women, no common people other than in the background, only white guys, just about all of them dressed pretty much the same and almost all wearing big beards. The atmosphere is slightly claustrophobic.The seriousness of the issue and the moral grandeur of Lincoln, (perhaps deriving as much from his historical reputation as his depiction in the film) keep one's interest. Obviously the passing of the bill is a foregone conclusion, so there's no real suspense.I couldn't help imagining this film when it comes out on DVD or in five or ten years from now, when it appears on television. How many people will want to see it for a second time? I don't think many people will. Teachers will use it, but I have a feeling it will be largely forgotten in the world of movies.Are these Oscar-worthy performances? The acting is excellent, but, given the script, they didn't have great potential, and it's hard to see them as extraordinary.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great movie,"I love, love, love this movie! I can't say enough great things about it. I'm so glad that Daniel Day-Lewis won the Oscar, it was so well deserved. I thought that Sally Field was robbed of the Oscar. This is not just a wonderfully great film, but an educational one as well. I learned things about that time period and Lincoln that I had either forgotten or never knew. I just loved it all the way through from start to finish. All the actors were great. I think that the guy who played Seward was a bit overlooked as I felt he was just as good as Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. I saw this film three times in the theater, it is that good. It's well acted, well directed, well edited, well put together and an A+ film. If you haven't seen yet, don't delay go rent it today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Flawed but recommended,"I saw Lincoln yesterday and have been turning the movie over in my head. Something seemed lacking. Then I realized what that was.The movie portrayed Congress debating over the 13th Amendment that would end slavery. The movie also portrayed only politically correct Black people. In Lincoln one only sees black people that are smartly dressed soldiers, suited gentlemen, and immaculately dressed, well-spoken and seemingly college educated women.That historical fiction blights the movie.The vast majority of Blacks in 1865 were not well-spoken, well-dressed, or well-educated. They had been denied access to such opportunities.A reasonable person, in 1865, imbued with the observations of their time, might well believe that Black people were inferior in intellect or that that Black people weren't ready for the responsibilities of freedom. In Lincoln, you see these arguments aired. However, the speeches seem nonsensical when the movie deliberately declined to provide the social and cultural context that would have supported those perspectives.There is a lot to like about Lincoln, though. Daniel Day Lewis was exceptional in the lead role. He avoided the mistake of making A. Lincoln a caricature of who Lincoln was. The characters and the script closely follow history. Few actors could have so believably delivered the role of Thaddeus Stevens but Tommy Lee Jones manages that very well.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great historical film,"For his biopic ""Lincoln,"" rather than try to cram a man's entire life into a two-and-a-half-hour running time, Steven Spielberg has wisely chosen to keep the focus circumscribed and narrow: on the winter of 1865, four years into the Civil War, as the President works to secure passage of the highly controversial 13th Amendment, which, when ratified, will abolish slavery as an institution in the United States for all time to come. Lincoln's main hope is to convince a skeptical and still highly racist public that such a move is essential to bringing an end to a war that has already claimed 600,000 of their young men's lives. The obstacles that remain are the Democrats in Congress who are universally opposed to such a move and many Republicans who think this constitutional amendment may well pave the way to universal suffrage, with not just blacks but women ultimately being given the right to vote. Lincoln's major hope is to convince a sufficient number of lame duck Democrats to come over to his side, while not allowing the amendment's passage to throw a monkey wrench into any possibility of surrender on the part of the Confederacy.A man of both faith and reason, pragmatism and passion, Lincoln knew that he stood on the threshold of history, that he needed to act decisively and at that very moment to wipe out the scourge of slavery that, since the young nation's inception, had brought shame and evil to a republic ostensibly founded on the concept that all men are created equal.The movie beautifully captures Lincoln as a man bowed down by the burden of his position and the times in which he not only lived but played so vital a role in shaping, a brilliant but self-effacing man, keenly cognizant of his humble beginnings, as ready to lend an ear to the lowliest foot soldier or telegraph operator as to the greatest general or politician - indeed more eager in some cases, for he knew that the common man often had more honesty in his answer and wisdom in his soul than the great one.This is the man whom screenwriter Tony Kushner and author Doris Kearns Goodwin, upon whose book ""Team of Rivals"" the movie is based, present to the audience.But that isn't all. The movie also functions as both a fascinating look into the events of the time and as an illustration of how even the noblest advances in human history have often arisen out of a messy combination of moral compromise and shady back-room deal-making. The most obvious embodiment of that is Thaddeus Stephens (played with solid conviction and a sly self-awareness by Tommy Lee Jones), a Republican Congressman who has to weigh his strong abolitionist views against the pragmatic need to get things right.The script encompasses Lincoln's domestic circle as well, as it explores the complex relationship between Lincoln and his wife, Mary Todd (Sally Field), a brutally frank, sharp-tongued woman frequently brought low by debilitating migraines and steeped in grief over the loss of their young son, Todd, a few years back. We also see the effect of all this on the Lincolns' oldest son, Robert (Joseph Gordon- Levitt), who is forced to live in the shadow of a great man, convinced he will never be able to live at peace with himself unless he is allowed to fight alongside all the other boys of his age on the field of battle.A host of familiar faces - David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Walter Goggins, James Spader, S. Epatha Merkerson, among them - flesh out the canvas. And what a glorious canvas it turns out to be, thanks to meticulous set decoration and costume design as well as cinematography by the great Janusz Kaminski that filters the action through duskily-lit interiors and near-sepia-toned exteriors.Of course, ""Lincoln"" would not be the triumph it is without the exemplary performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, who manages to turn a towering figure of history into a recognizable human being. Stoop-shouldered and slow of speech and motion, Day-Lewis conveys the quiet gravity that allows us to understand just how this one man could command the respect of so many of the people of his time and, in so doing, move mountains.All involved have made ""Lincoln"" a portrait worthy of its subject.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Bit of a hit and miss,"This film could have been so much more.Spielberg does a fine job in putting the audience in the government offices in the 1860's and give us an insight of the struggle Lincoln were faced with in bringing about a change, in a culture that did not like change. So much we take for granted today required many sacrifices, something we remain stubbornly ignorant of.The issue I have with this movie, was the title. Why Lincoln? Who was Lincoln? Where did he get his values from? Who were his influences? Why, how and by whom did he die? All we get from Lincoln is the aspect of his life in government. Had the movie been titled ""13th amendment"", it would have been a different story altogether.Despite the great narrative and cinematography, not to mention performances, it was too long with much of its substance lost to the display of political wrangling, which though utterly necessary the extent to which it was done disconnected me few times.Furthermore, I found the anti-racist overtone done a little too much. The majority of today's audiences in the West despise racism and find slavery pure evil. We did not need a reminder throughout the film that slavery was plain wrong no matter what the angle, unless the film was made back in the 50's or 60s.There's definitely greatness in this film, but it is also greatly overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Lincoln is a Revealing, Captivating Look at U.S. History","Just give them the damn Oscars already! That was my reaction when word first went around that Steven Spielberg was making an Abraham Lincoln biopic, with Daniel Day-Lewis playing the ill-fated 16th president. With a top-notch cast, ""Lincoln"" lives up to expectations and delivers a revealing look at arguably the most important figure in American History.If you're expecting to see large-scale, graphic depictions of Civil War battles, you may be disappointed. The film is loosely based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln."" It covers Lincoln's final months as he juggles the seemingly impossible task of passing the 13th Amendment to abolish slavery and trying to end the Civil War.Though nicknamed ""Honest Abe,"" the film portrays Lincoln less as a saint and more as a tactful politician. With 20 Democratic votes needed to pass the 13th Amendment, Lincoln enlists the help of Republican radical Thaddeus Steven (Tommy Lee Jones) and W.N. Bilbo (James Spader), whose back-door politicking and shady deals are necessary to help sway the votes of the opposition and change the course of history forever.Irishman Day-Lewis immerses himself into the role of an American icon. Sure, he's got the towering gaunt looks, but this isn't your gruff-voiced and stoic Lincoln in prior portrayals. Day-Lewis' high tenor vocal projection (often noted by historians) commands your attention during his (obligatory) philosophical and expertly worded stories and speeches. His steely gazes and moments of silence illustrate the melancholia and vulnerability of a rational man deep in struggle to find peace in an irrational, divided country.The supporting cast (Spader, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Michael Stuhlbarg) is equally captivating. The standout performances belong to Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field. Jones' energetic portrayal of Republican radical and Lincoln ally Thaddeus Stevens is one of his best roles. On the exterior he is a wig-covered, rickety old man, but once he opens his mouth do we see a powerful, passionate, and often hilarious freedom fighter who's as wily as he is cunning in the courtroom. Sally Field delivers a maddening performance as first lady Mary Todd Lincoln. Clad in lavish costumes, Field depicts the complexities of Lincoln's home life as she copes with the loss of a son and neglect of a husband trying to restore a nation.As a lifelong Spielberg fan, I'm once again impressed by the direction he took with the film. Spielberg and his longtime collaborator/cinematographer Janusz Kaminski downplays large CGI settings and go for detailed on-locations that seamlessly transport the audience to that time in history. The filmmakers also downplay the depiction of the war on the battlefield (which we have seen countless times) and lean toward the verbal skirmishes in the House of the Representatives. In some ways, one could argue that ""Lincoln"" is like Aaron Sorkin's ""The West Wing"" by way of ""Amistad,"" as the fiery quip-filled debates and desperate solutions are taken from the pages of history and presented intimately behind the doors of the dimly candlelit places of power.The film's Achilles heel is the running time. While there is little action or brief depictions of violence, it's Tony Kushner's witty screenplay that keeps viewers from looking at their watches and stirring in their seats. With the help and execution of the stellar cast, the movie never feels dull as some of the long dialogue sequences ooze with a sense of theatricality that makes every line feel as much as alive as it is thrilling.Lincoln needs to be seen by all not just for the outstanding performances and craftsmanship, but as a reminder of sacrifice and great lengths taken by one man to repair a shattered nation and forever alter the course of history for the greater good. Having said that give it a damn Oscar already!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
a masterly take on an immortal personality,"Difficult one to review as it's so multi-faceted. Abraham Lincoln as a character is without doubt one of the greatest, most famous, iconic, influential and brilliant men in the history of the World - especially the USA - and this is an educational, historically interesting, powerfully emotive depiction of that man and a snapshot of one of the most important moments in American (and World) history. The film is complicated to watch in that it's not slowed or dumbed down so you have to concentrate, and the writing is fast, intelligent and witty; I feel that the language was time-appropriate and the accents were good (to a non-American's ear) and Daniel Day-Lewis had clearly worked hard on his mannerisms to inhabit such a well-loved character. Day-Lewis's facial prostheses and SFX were superb, and the costume of all the characters fantastic. Sally Field was also well cast and performed well as Mary Lincoln and the scene where they both yell at each other/over each other's voices was particularly good; over the memory of the loss of their young son.Tommy Lee Jones and James Spader were both stand out actors/characters and some of the comic relief of the film, which was a surprising addition. The scene where Spader's is shot at and runs away and has time to run back while the firer is reloading his pistol is laugh out loud hilarious and Lee Jones has some funny lines too, which makes the dryness of the film a little more light hearted. Lincoln also was quite the raconteur and lover of funny tales which make Day-Lewis' character charming too. There's an all-star ensemble cast, so many of the actors are famous faces. One of them, Joseph Gordon-Levitt although a small role showed up how good he was an an actor, and the little boy who played Lincoln's youngest son was also particularly stand out talented.The screenplay and Spielberg's direction and ambition for this film were of a grand scale, lots of extras and little (apparently) in the way of CGI, which is good, and whilst I can find little to criticise with the direction and spectacle of the film as a whole, and it's emotional force, some of the cutting between scenes was a tad odd and jumpy, but I can't say that it bothered me so much, it was just worth mentioning. I liked reference to his diaries and, I thought, a sneaky reference to Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter or perhaps that was just my imagination.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Another propaganda film from Spielberg,"Together with some decent blockbusters, Spielberg has spent a portion of his career making propaganda films. That's fine, of course. He has a right to his opinion and he has the muscle and talent to express this opinion through movies.This particular movie is simply boring. It has other faults but there is no way around its lack of depth and capacity to engage.Historically, it is a mess. United States was the penultimate slaver country to abolish slavery (Brazil was the last one). Worry not, my dear fellow American, I believe Spielberg told us through another of his propaganda movies that slavery is to be blamed on Spain.The bottom line is that Spielberg is a republican and this one movie is meant to satisfy that particular itch.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Daniel Day Lewis is Lincoln,Daniel Day Lewis becomes President Abraham Lincoln in this fine film created by Steven Spielberg. Note that not even Spielberg's firm Dreamworks was solo on this production but also financed via 20th Century Fox and Disney! The film is serious reflection on President Lincoln and the production design commands praise. My only hesistton of this film is the performance of Sally Field who is 30 years older than Mary Todd Lincoln. Ms. Field brings her fine acting skills to the movie just that the age difference is jarring. Who else could Spielberg have cast? Daniel Day Lewis richly deserved the Oscar for this performanceSpieldbeg creates a lasting film classic with this fine film. But it is Day Lewis who will be remembere for bringing Abraham Lincoln to life.Roger Mantee,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
It is pretty slow...,"I don't hate this movie. I can appreciate the things about the movie that aren't bad. For instance, the cinematography in this movie is amazing. The pictures are beautiful and the scenes are well done. I think the darkness of the scenes in the movie added effect to Lincoln's exhaustion and created a heavy atmosphere. Also the actors do a great job. Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens especially caught my eye with their performance. The thing that really brings this movie down is the plot. The pacing of the movie is really slow and it is sometimes hard to follow. I realize that the movie follows Lincoln as he tries to pass the 13th amendment and is meant to dive deeper into his personality, but so much of the movie focused on Lincoln's life inside the White House which just isn't super interesting. I can appreciate the idea of the movie, but it is not my favorite.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""These dead shall not have died in vain""","Stephen Spielberg did some meticulous research or maybe I should say that Doris Kearns Goodwin did some for him when she wrote her best seller Team Of Rivals about Lincoln and his Cabinet during the Civil War. Otherwise Lincoln the film wouldn't be a film destined to win a lot of awards next year. Spielberg had it all down, including the club foot that Thaddeus Stevens had.By the time that 1865 rolled around a most war weary public just wanted an end and they could see it in sight with Grant battering Lee in Virginia and taking some heavy casualties every time out and Sherman coming up from Georgia through the Carolinas after Joe Johnston. However the man in the White House had a deeper concern, he wanted something out of the war, something lasting. Like an end to slavery once and for all.So with the Confederates looking to salvage their Slaveocracy and sending peace commissioners and the Radical Republicans like Charles Sumner in the Senate and Thaddeus Stevens in the House wanting abolition once and for all, Lincoln steered a tricky course through public opinion to get the 13th amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery.In a nutshell the film Lincoln is about one of the lines from his famous Gettysburg Address. Abraham Lincoln wanted to know in his heart that the people he memorialized, who lay beneath the soil at Gettysburg, died for a noble purpose. As he said on that occasion, ""these dead shall not have died in vain"".Not everyone in politics is in it for anything noble however and the President of the United States had more in the way of patronage to make things happen that he wanted. God only knows for instance what Lyndon Johnson had to offer to bring a few votes along to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Not everyone voted for that strictly to memorialize the late John F. Kennedy. Lincoln was an old hand at that from his years in Illinois.Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field make a splendid Abe and Mary Lincoln and Spielberg gave us enough of a view of the home life at the White House with the two surviving sons. Robert Lincoln who was more his mother's son than his father's except he inherited Lincoln's ability as a lawyer wanted very much to serve in the Civil War. But Mary Lincoln lost her two boys between Robert and Tad and did not want to lose her oldest in the war. So Robert unlike his father who studied law by candlelight and clerked, got a Harvard education instead. Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Robert and young Gulliver McGrath plays the mischievous Thomas Todd 'Tad' Lincoln.Of the supporting cast Thaddeus Stevens as played by Tommy Lee Jones is most memorable. Stevens who unofficially led the Radicals was a man way ahead of his time. His 'housekeeper' was a black woman with whom he had two daughters whom he could not marry because of miscegenation laws. He wanted full equality for all and did not care who knew it. Later on he led the effort to impeach Lincoln's successor Andrew Johnson who as Vice President-elect plays no role here as most Vice Presidents do. That whole story is told albeit with a different historical slant in the film Tennessee Johnson with Van Heflin as Johnson and Lionel Barrymore as Stevens.I think the only question remaining is how many Oscars Lincoln will pick up next year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not Aptly Titled,"No complaints about the plot, acting, writing or anything else regarding the film. All those things are top notch. My only complaint is that the film should have been named ""13"" instead of ""Lincoln"" because the plot is 98% about the politics surrounding the passing of the 13th amendment and 2% about the man Abraham Lincoln. To me, that's a total shame. In my humble opinion, the man is the most interesting person in history so this was an extremely disappointing movie for me. His humble upbringing in Hodgenville, KY, his insatiable desire to self-educate, the death of his mother at an early age, his tumultuous relationship with his father, their move to Indiana and then Illinois, the fact that he was a world-class wrestler, his relationship with his best friend and law partner Henry Herndon, the loss of his son Willie, the loss of his son Tad, the assassination, the institutionalization of Mary Todd, the legacy of his son Robert Todd and how he himself was present at the assassination of Garfield and the impact it had on him.To be clear, if you are interested in watching a movie about politics during the civil war era, this movie will thoroughly entertain you. But if you are expecting an epic biopic of the man's life, you will be severely disappointed. Again, they shouldn't have entitled this movie Lincoln. It is NOT aptly named.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
'Lincoln' a Tall Accomplishment,"KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Anthony Aranda, age 10, makes a valuable observation when he says, "" the history is important to kids like me."" The movie Lincoln depicts the President during the Civil War, a pivotal time in United States history. "" it's a really good movie to teach more about the Civil War,"" Anthony says. He also feels the movie shows this President, who has become almost a mythological figure in many depictions, as a ""regular person."" Heavily researched, Lincoln's depiction of the man may provide a new perception amongst the older folks in the audience as well. Says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Morgan Bertsch, age 8, ""I thank Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks for making this fabulous movie.""Reviewed by Anthony Aranda Video Review here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__EBxLluPQsLincoln is pretty good but it was made for an older audience. I usually don't watch too many movies that are this serious, but the history is important to kids like me. This movie is all about President Abraham Lincoln, and in the movie it's the middle of the Civil War so Lincoln is trying to make peace between the North and the South. He creates the Thirteenth Amendment so there will be peace in the country.The main characters in the movie are Abraham Lincoln, Lincoln's wife and Lincoln's son. My favorite character is, of course, Lincoln because he is a good guy but he needs to spend time with his family more. He is too distracted by the Thirteenth Amendment that he almost forgets about his family. He really loves his family, but he also really loves the citizens of the country.My favorite part in the movie is when Lincoln's son is riding in the White House with a goat and a carriage. Another funny part is when one of Lincoln's advisers walks in looking for the President and sees his son sitting, reading the paper like a grown up. There were some scary parts during the movie when the soldiers were fighting and getting hurt. This was a sad part for me, also, to watch.To me, the movie is more than just what we know from the history books. I think it shows me a little more about Abraham Lincoln as a regular person. And it's a really good movie to teach more about slavery and the Civil War, which is a really important part of our history.I would recommend this movie for ages 12 and up only because the movie was meant for an older audience and there is some pretty graphic stuff in there. But if you love history, this is a great movie for you. Go out and see this movie in theaters now.Reviewed by Morgan Bertsch Video review here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctaRvzOuHk4I thank Steven Spielberg and DreamWorks for making this fabulous movie.

I think they do a great job.This is actually a time piece with an amazing all-star cast. And also, the costumes are fantastic!There's a little bit of language and also parts of violence, but the history lesson is everything that everyone should learn.

confusing and... long.,"Although I hold this movie in high regard, I found myself becoming bored with the direction and lost in some parts. If you didn't understand the actual history in this movie, I feel like you wouldn't appreciate it as much. It lacked any sort of direction and the way the scenes were set up made me lose focus of the plot. One amazing thing about the film however is the actors. Daniel Day-Lewis was an eerily accurate Lincoln and with the way he played this character you would sometimes forget that this wasn't actually Lincoln on your screen. And the amazing portrayal of people and historical figures during this decade and obviously the huge triumph that was the 13th amendment.

Spectacularly Underwhleming,"I went in with high expectations; after all this movie has a top notch director, an all-star cast, and monumental subject matter. I came out wondering if I could get my money back, as this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Well, what I saw of it. Fortunately, the theater was nearly empty, so I did not disturb other viewers with my snoring as this disaster bored me to sleep. Twice.After the shock of wasting that much of my life on this flop, I realized my anger was not directed at what a bad movie it was (and it was a truly bad movie), but what I later realized was it was such a colossal waste of time and talent. It could have been a very good movie, a spectacular movie for all time, but it never even got started on getting close to that level.As a movie about Lincoln, it devoted very little of the movie to the subject, spending over half of it recreating the machinations of the House of Representatives debating the 13th Amendment. There was some new insight into Lincoln himself, for which Mr. Day-Lewis should be well credited, but taken as a whole, this was a monumental flop.Mr. Day-Lewis was, by all accounts, able to recreate some of the physical characteristics of the late President, most notably his awkward gait. Several scenes depicted Mr. Day-Lewis plodding away down a hall in a perfect analogy for the movie - a slow, ponderous, heavy, dull and boring.Added to the bad acting, bad directing, and bad writing were the bad visual effects - the CGI additions to buildings that didn't quite fit- plus all the little things that will appear as ""goofs"" in the pages of IMDb.com as others watch this monstrosity on DVD later.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

tough call,"The consensus on performance is ""spot on""--there is not a bad performance in ""Lincoln."" In fact, they are stellar. DD Lewis can, on occasion, come off as a bit too studied and slightly transparent, but not often enough for it to matter. All the other roles are just spectacularly played.However, and it is a big however, this film is often dull, insipid, and overly florid. I have several advanced degrees and can handle didactic films, however, Lincoln stalls quite often with verbosity that fails to entertain and drama that seems, well, a bit stagy. That is my take--there is a lot of room for disagreement here. But I think the bandwagon effect is propelling this film toward awards which from the vantage of performance are probably justified, but from the vantage of all other technical areas, is hardly justifiable at all. Journeyman work,yes, but inspired? Not at all. Despite my reservations, this is still a movie that most people will enjoy.

Daniel Day Lewis is the main reason this movie is so good. His portrayal of Lincoln is the best to be ever seen on screen, he plays so well it's like the real Abraham Lincoln is in front of you alive and well. The rest of the cast are amazing. Another reason this movie is so good and doesn't flop is for its cinematography and plot. The plot mostly focuses on the 13th amendment and the end of the civil war. Both events are important in American history so seeing them on screen is a big opportunity and a welcomed one. The cinematography adds a lot to the film for capturing the moments of tension during the movie, the dark colors being used rapidly throughout the scenes.

I also liked learning all of the stuff going into the freeing of slaves and giving slaves rights. Before the movie i had never really thought of other people like Thaddeus Stevens that helped push rights for slaves but now i know him for what he did.

decent history involved.,"I rather expected the voice to be deeper and more commanding, but that wore off instantly, and Spielberg to his credit gets every scene note-perfect. The scene where soldiers on the field were quoting back to him the Gettysburg Address was heartbreaking--The big guns, to be sure, but everyone in the theater stopped breathing. Spielberg has the mood and light fine-tuned to the point that when the characters are donning shawls against the cold--this in the white house--you shiver. I can'think of a single actor who was not up to snuff, but James Spader as a rascally vote procurer stands out. Sally Field as the troubled Mary Todd Lincoln is a sympathetic gem, and her portrayal should go a long way towards explaining and perhaps inviting history's revision of that unhappy woman. The film focuses most on the nuts and bolts of legislative and presidential processes, and while that may be boring for some,it has such a ring of authenticity and research that it had me scrambling for the history books to check on things I hadn't known. This is the most difficult of all subjects to film, a dense scholarly work translated to popular culture, but it succeeds on all counts. See it, make your children go with you.

Steven's Lincoln is an Important Film Made and Played With Such Seriousness You Feel Proud To Be A Part Of The Experience,"Steven Spielberg's 'Lincoln' is so dignified and composed in depicting the endeavor of the Sixteenth President of United States that you feel proud to witness the victory achieved by its characters. It is a movie which makes you want to get up on your feet at the end and stand in silence for two minutes as a mark of tribute to Mr. President. Steven Spielberg makes his film keeping in mind that it isn't snazzy camera editing and unusual angles that will supply the strength that this film requires, but the careful and thorough understanding and execution of its central themes with the help of a perfect cast. Spielberg had an array of options to alter the cinematography of his film to make it more fast-paced and create tension using swifter camera movements, but he does not use innovative techniques because he knows that it wouldn't work here. He wants us to listen closely to every spoken and unspoken word and feel the crucial significance of the subject matter.There are heavy dialogues involving constitutional amendments, slavery, Euclid's principle etc and we can choose to skip all this and concentrate on the popcorn in our hands or pay attention, and when we do the latter we rejoice along with the film's characters when victory is attained. There was a 'groupie' of youngsters who left the hall when Mr. Lincoln was gravely pondering about some matter in the first half, and I was relieved those idiots left because they were obviously little interested in the subject and would certainly not have found a reason to celebrate later. I, on the other hand missed about fifteen minutes in the beginning and yet found myself extremely engrossed by every word of dialogue spoken by brilliant actors in Lincoln, and later got to share their joy and victory as if it was I who had attained emancipation.The groupie that left the hall had possibly bunked their college lecture or got to know that it was Spielberg's film or had glanced at the online ratings for Lincoln. I do not think they truly what the subject matter was and just came in thinking that they were going to see Lincoln jumping off a building evading knife-wielding Democrats. Lincoln's actual concern is the pursuit to find a solution to end the Civil war and pass the 13th amendment for abolishment of slavery in the Constitution. President Abraham Lincoln is the central instrument in bringing an end to both the crisis and the unjust legislation, but what we realize here is that it isn't an aggressive, outspoken and impractical Lincoln who's leading the party but an extremely sensible, persuasive, down-to-earth and astute (sometimes crafty too) Lincoln who's responsible for orchestrating the historical events.He is very much like the director of a play, staying behind-the-scenes to let his party do the battle for him in the parliament while formulating the most carefully planned strategy to achieve enough support for success. Not once do we see him personally countering the Democrats but hear his voice through the voices of his supporters, which includes radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens who brings in the blunt and fiery force that Lincoln outwardly lacks. The movie hardly takes us to the scene of the actual war (we only get to see the gory aftermath), instead choosing to concentrate on the political battlefield between Democrats and Republicans in finding a solution to the war. We also get glimpses from Lincoln's personal life: his relationship with his strong- willed yet intensely caring wife Mary and some touching moments involving Lincoln and his youngest son Tad. And yes there is Lincoln's elder son Robert but the character is very forgettable because of Josh Gordon Levitt's underdeveloped interpretation of him.In one of the scenes involving Lincoln and Robert, Lincoln remarks that he does not believe in people who prophesize too much; yet when the voting for the thirteenth amendment ends, we see Lincoln celebrating his victory embracing Tad in his office. This moment very subtly shows that Lincoln himself has predicted how his son's future shall be (one with relatively less inequality). This is just one of the many beautiful moments that brilliantly justify the themes of equality, freedom, courage, perseverance, heroism and compassion. Nothing (at least to me who is more open-minded to optimistic resolutions) to me sounded preachy or maudlin partly because Tony Kushner pens the script so well, allowing us to have moments of great fun with Thaddeus' irresistible zingers and the entire voting session with its twists and turns.And more importantly it is the cast that makes us root for the movie's characters. Just listening to Daniel Day Lewis' calm yet extremely effective vocal delivery made me accept him as the President of the United States. Lewis is also supported by the camera work which circles around him and his audience (to whom he is directing something or just telling a story –a profound story) till it slowly pans and zooms into his face and we are all ears to him. The most astonishing part was how Lewis showed Lincoln's gradual aging through a slight crackle in his voice and an avuncular sparkle in his eyes that many older people, especially grandfathers have. While Sally supports Lewis effortlessly in her scenes, it is Tommy Lee Jones who nails Thaddeus so well that we are just as emotionally involved with his character as we are with Lewis'.Comedienne Joan Rivers said on her show she 'found Lincoln so boring, although the movie had everything'; well, I think Rivers envied Thaddeus' character because he gave her still competition in repartee. I believe an important subject or person should be treated with highest seriousness and regard, and Spielberg does exactly that. 'If you want fluff, go watch a Katherine Heigl movie!'... I know I've begun sounding like Thaddeus Stevens now, but why I shouldn't when I believe in Spielberg's 'Lincoln'.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincolon - Not a typo,"Recently I had the opportunity to watch Lincoln, or the more aptly named Lincolon. Two hours of horrendous script and fiction woven by a zealot with a thesaurus who believed that replacing words such as 'empty' with 'vacus' turned his sup-par script into a masterpiece.The film started with good old honest Abe 'relaxing' or should that be 'tranquilize thy consciousness' on a military camp site with the men but not just men, black men! The mood and tone of the film has been set, Lincolon is grounded and relaxed when surrounded by the people. He's one of you. Isn't he wonderful! Made ever so much harder to believe when we can quote Licolon from his debates with Douglas in 1858:""I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, — that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to hold office, not to intermarry with white people; and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will for ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality.""The great political insights I gathered from this film was that 19th century American politics consisted of politicians calling each other farty pants and vacus nincompoops. It was the equivalent of watching 'Dude where's my car' set in the 19th Century. If that wasn't bad enough good old honest Abe was there to make sure we suffered.Every ten minutes good old lovely Abe would tell the out of depth mere mortals a story that would give us great depth and insight into a situation that would, within a few seconds change that persons entire outlook on life. Half way through the film I began to believe I had walked into a movie about the second coming of Christ. At one point, even the script writer had become so tired of writing Abe's story's that he added himself into the script via a character with the lines 'I know what you're going to do! You're going to tell one of your story's again! I'm not staying around for this!'. A thought probably shared by millions who've watched this film.As for Daniel Day Lewis's Oscar winning performance. I can recreate the performance right here in text.""Would you like some tea Abe?"" "".........................................yes, i.... think I.... will""""What do we do Abe?""

The historical accuracy of this film rivals that of 'Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter' It's a pure work of fiction and anybody who believes the civil war was about abolishing slavery needs to spend only ten minutes with their head in a history book to know the truth.I will end this review with a final quote from the white messiah Abe Lincolon.""If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.""",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Inner Workings of the Government,"I have to admit that despite my cynicism about government, I loved ""The West Wing"" and enjoy so much a movie that digs into the real politics of a time. While there are a couple of schmaltzy moments in this film (like Lincoln's first appearance to the young soldiers), I was able to forgive that and allow them to start their story. I think that Daniel Day-Lewis has again become the character that he is portraying. I've read that there are numerous descriptions of Lincoln's dialectic and his voice quality. I'm sure the technicians worked hard to create as much authenticity as possible. I stopped thinking of actors nearly a quarter into the film and began to see them as well-developed historical figures. Sally Field is one of America's great actresses. She has proved that. Her Mary is troubled but played with restraint. She is not the howling nut case that is how she is unfortunately portrayed. She is fragile and deserves pathos. The politicians are intriguing and flawed in their own ways, just as all human beings are. Tommy-Lee Jones creates an unforgettable figure. The real hero of this film is a script that pulls and tugs at people who carry the baggage of the nineteenth century with them in their decision making. The Union is at a pass that could cause it to come tumbling down. It is LIncoln who sees this and begins to strong-arm those who have the ultimate say. He isn't kindly old Abe in these circumstances. Greatness requires one to leave a few bodies along the way (figuratively, of course). He also is seen as a man who understands the world he is cast into. One wonders why he took this on; what was in it for him? This is a splendid film. The acting is unparalleled. The battlefield effects show a person who has a deep understanding of pain and violence. I was not disappointed in this for a moment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Historical Lessons Still Viable Today.,"Sixteenth U.S. President Abraham Lincoln (a mind-blowing part by the seemingly always flawless Daniel Day-Lewis) struggles to get his policies for emancipating all enslaved African-Americans passed through the Legislative Branch of government as the bloody final days of the Civil War continue in early 1865. An amazing cinematic achievement by director Steven Spielberg as he primarily uses the the nearly unending novel ""Team of Rivals"" by Doris Kearns Goodwin to create a portrait of quite possibly the most polarizing political and social reforms in this country's long history. In a time now when bi-partisanship is a romantic idea which seems more hypothetical than realistic, Lincoln struggled with North vs. South and Republican vs. Democrat just as contemporary presidents today do. Tommy Lee Jones steals every scene as Thaddeus Stevens, a politician trying to get all of Lincoln's policies through Congressional meanderings. Sally Field is also on hand as Lincoln's wife who struggles herself with the death of the couple's young son. Field's emotional fire has to be tamed though as her part could almost be an entire movie to itself and in the end the 16th President's ability to somehow immerse himself further in the nation's civil war and its possible political future uncertainties even after a potential emotional breakdown after his family's personal tragedy. ""Lincoln"" is deeper than an ocean. It has a bare minimum of action and is highly talkative ala something in the line of ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or even ""Gandhi"". Spielberg almost makes the film feel like an elaborate stage play with top-of-the-line performers going effortlessly from scene to scene and creating emotional fireworks. Day-Lewis is the catalyst, but his supporting cast never backs down from his challenge of acting excellence as they all add to his almost mythic portrayal of quite possibly our most important commander-in-chief. As usual, Spielberg creates a historical atmosphere (basically showing Washington, D.C. as a small village which doubles as a mud trap of a town with moist soil at least a foot deep in almost every direction) which puts his audience in another time and another place. Towering achievement on many various cinematic levels. ""Lincoln"" is destined to be one of those rare productions which will likely survive time, its critics, and those who fail to believe in the power of the cinema to educate, influence, and enlighten. Total excellence. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
brilliant,"This movie makes Abraham Lincoln the imperfect yet magnificent man, come right out of the screen at you. The lead is portrayed with sincerity and to great effect and is entirely in- character. This is entirely what I imagined Lincoln to be: at times affable, keenly focused, and at once erudite and folksy. This character, in all of his dimensions, even the tragic ones, is played expertly.Sally Field gives a command performance as Mary Todd Lincoln. It is nothing shy of magnificent. She is to be applauded for this fine effort.The production values are tremendous. John William's music is unobtrusive but highly atmospheric. The cinematography fully conveys the 'world lit by fire' atmosphere of the mid 19th century.The creators of this movie are smart enough to focus on the events leading up to the 13th amendment. This was an epic process and the scope of the film is correct.It is likely this will be seen as a definitive depiction of Lincoln.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln simple review,"Daniel Day-Lewis. Do these actors get any more phenomenal then he? If you were to think of an amazing character actor, who absorbs the script and the background of his character but also adds his own twist and personality to the character. I know i use this word in lots of my reviews but 'Emphatic' he was. What can't he do. Same as the great person he portrays. Abraham Lincoln, an iconic founding-father who would be extremely hard to play for any one to play. I think it was hard for even Day-Lewis to do. But he was spectacular. Sally Fields is the Leading actress but i don't feel that she leads very much. Marry Todd Lincoln supported Abe to the best of his abilities and i feel that Sally Fields did that same thing with Daniel. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was a good surprise as Lincoln's son Robert but the best part other than Day-Lewis was the heartfelt performance by Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens. He was great. But back to the film. I always found it hard to take Steven Spielberg's Directing hard. But he did a fine job with this. Fine like a nice Italian woman who is walking down the street, like that Fiat-500 commercial. Not the fine like ""Oh that was satisfactory, that was fine."" I'm not calling Steven Spielberg a fine Italian woman, but his directing here was great. I can't imagine having all of those actors portraying congressmen in one room and the camera stands and cranes and all of the crew on one set and having to manage all that. I know he had assistant directors and such but i salute him for even taking the task. The cinematography nomination was well deserved as it was one of the best of the year. Although the film was phenomenal even the smallest acting role was played to perfection. It was neither the crew nor their microphones and cameras that submerge you in the story. It was the acting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
American icon in political procedural,"Version I saw: UK cinema releaseActors: 8/10Plot/script: 7/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 7/10Overall: 7/10When names like Abraham Lincoln, Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis coincide, you know it's going to be a major cinematic event. Given the legendary status of this historical figure though, and his importance to American national identity, they could have gone safe and made a hagiography, a film about a saintly man being saintly and having no flaws whatsoever.Instead, they focused on one particular event, the passing of the law that outlawed slavery throughout the United States. In order to see it through, Lincoln is required to perpetrate an ongoing deception about the status of the war which is hanging over Congress' heads and inclining them to favour abolition of slavery. He lies over and over again, explicitly contradicting the traditional portrayal of ""Honest Abe"", the man who ""cannot tell a lie.""The result is a 'political procedural', rather like the excellent TV series 'The West Wing', in which characters stay true to their principles because of - not despite - their wisdom and fine judgement in knowing when to compromise. This is exemplified in the film by Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, the character played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones, who climbs down from his tub-thumping rhetoric of absolute racial equality that has spooked many of the more conservative Representatives from voting in a bill which clearly leads in that direction.Due to Spielberg's talent for melodrama, this is a fascinating story filled with tension, in which the title character's flaws are not shied away from. Coming in the same month or so as Django Unchained, it showed a much better way of making a film about American slavery, without Tarantino's ridiculous excesses.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/02/lincoln-2012.html",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Excellent Historical Drama,"First off, LINCOLN is more about the passage of the 13th Amendment outlawing slavery in the U.S. and all the haggling that took place in the House of Representatives beforehand than it is about Abe Lincoln personally. The entire story takes place in the early months of 1865 as the Civil War is winding down.Lincoln does, of course, play a pivotal role as the central character in his proposal and backing of the Amendment (yet still, kind of not wanting the war to end before it was voted upon in order to keep the Southern delegations out of the vote). There is also a fine subplot concerning Lincoln's life with his wife and sons, all of whom are admirably played. Day-Lewis really shines in his role as a Lincoln who is neither saint nor sinner, with a smooth, velvety, and vaguely southern(!) accent. Many of the supporting cast--most particularly, Jared Harris as Ulysses Grant--are also memorably portrayed.This may not sound terribly exciting to some, but the acting, storyline, scenery and everything else are so arresting that those people are likely to forget not being all that interested. Along with the vital ingredient of plot, some other best things about ""Lincoln"" are its setting and costume design: This film probably conveys the Civil War period better than any that I've seen. There isn't much actual showing of the war, but a couple of very brief but vivid and ultra-realistic battleground scenes really spice things up. Both in Washington and in the brief scenes elsewhere, the cinematography takes you there in a powerful way.Finally, this film is very revealing about the ""buying"" of votes in Congress and effectively shows how political processes worked and continue to work. A fascinating bit of historical and political intrigue.A couple of tips:--Younger audiences, unless they happen to have an unusual interest in political processes, are likely to be bored with LINCOLN.--If you aren't all that up on Secretary of State William Seward, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, and some of the various other players, it might be helpful to read-up a little on them before watching this.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Sally Field as Mary Lincoln shows she is a great actress. Tommy Lee Jones shines as Thaddeus Stevens. The host of great supporting actors is too long to enumerate. Then there is the script, a slap in the face to the mindless pablum so common to movies nowadays. Tony Kushner has written an extremely intelligent, historically informed script about Lincoln's struggle to pass the 13th amendment, and all the legal and moral complexities involved in that struggle. It is truly aimed at thoughtful, intelligent adults. This is simply a must-see film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"An aw-inspiring political drama, a talented ensemble and a rigid example of consistent greatness through 250 minutes of playing! Set in the 1860s; thus is Lincoln","An aw-inspiring political drama, a talented ensemble and a rigid example of consistent greatness through 250 minutes of playing! Set in the 1860s; thus is Lincoln. Centered on President Abraham Lincoln's, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, trial to pass the thirteenth amendment to put a halt to slavery and a nudge up in Negroes rights! Supported by his wife Mary Todd Lincoln, played by the returning Sally Field, and another fierce opponent of slavery Thaddeus Stevens played by Tommy Lee Jones.Time! I have waited countless years, for a movie of such a caliber and where my efforts of digging up a lope hole would be literally useless! A flawless movie? Strictly and undeniably impossible, But a movie lacking a significant mistake conspiring against its claim for an automatic Oscar win! A screenplay well portraying its characters; profiling them to perfection; there's something in script-writing called ""respect your characters"" where the screenwriter give every character the respect to play a certain role in the development of the chain of events, to be understood and given the screening he deserves; in the end the character is a part of the movie rather than concentrating on one character. Some critics have criticized the movie as too much concentration on Lincoln neglecting the other characters, those critics should first criticize their reviews then upgrade himself to a ""movie critic"". This movie is indeed called after president Lincoln but the screenwriter; Tony Kushner coherently showed the movie from different character's perspectives. Thaddeus Stevens' family, Robert Lincoln struggling with life decisions, Preston Blair's support and his daughter taking care of him, all that portrayed to the viewers. Frankly, This movie had moments where the camera concerted on Lincoln, moments where we'll forget others existed and focus on the remarkable acting and the firmness yet easy going personality of Lincoln; however, That balance of Lincoln and other characters was well exhibited; after all you should expect Lincoln to have a bigger role than the rest, but the trick is to respect other's role no matter it's size; that's the screenwriter's role.Steven Spielberg added his touches that iced the cake, well decorated it and properly presented for the Oscar consideration. His decision for this kind of camera movement is well associated with a movie concentrating on history's political life. A scene where Lincoln; a giant that he is; emerges from the camera or a camera positioned on the soldier and Lincoln's legendary facial structures positioned on the bottom corner of the camera acting like a shadow and then suddenly shifting it's angles; facing Lincoln showing his size sitting talking to his understudies with a smile on his face kicking off the movie with a blink from the future; a future he desires to be an era of equality. Thus is portrayed with a simple yet difficult concept of camera movement! Lincoln to be effectively presented to the viewers must consist of contributions from a diverse four fields of movie production: directing, writing, makeup and finally acting. Steven Spielberg played his part well and well, deserved the nomination.In life some personalities have opinions different from others, believes that basically distinguishes them from others! If you reshuffle earth and pick every person individually to be chosen to posses beliefs identical to that of Lincoln's in the thirteenth amendment; it would be like picking a car from a bunch of flowers. So is shown in the movie. Thaddeus Stevens ,Lincoln's debater, for the amendment had his dissatisfaction in what this plead provides for the future, in normal ""movie"" circumstances he would agree 100% with Lincoln and edging it all up with a bow and the line ""yes Mr. president"". That was indeed not seen; just a breadcrumb of the screenplay's magnificence's and ability to add numerous life-like occasions.Life-likeness is the criteria upon which a good movie separates itself from the rest of the disgraceful motion pictures around in Hollywood. People nervously sitting on the edge of their seats waiting in the telegraph room; for news about the war and a beckon of light in a body sits there with no burden on his back, narrates a story for the people there and everybody regardless of the irrelevance of the story; silently listening and being entertained by his great story telling abilities. Moments where he walks around his house wrapped in a blanket adds the life like impressions of the movie. And the need for Lincoln for basic protection from coldness, a giant in physical and heart-form; but a human, nevertheless.During the course of writing this review I've waited to begin my walk toward Daniel Day-Lewis. Down a road of criticism? A road of lope holes? But a road of utter confession to perfection. I have never imagined I would need to use the word ""perfection"" once mentioning the movie industry, until now! His performance in there will be blood was outstanding but never a game changer! After watching this movie you would be convinced that such a character existed on this planet; not merely a character in a movie played by an actor. I have never imagined President Lincoln in front of me, but in the future when I do, it'll definitely be an image of him. Much the debate I have had about him or Hugh Jackman for the Oscar, I have never been more convinced in my life; Daniel Day-Lewis for the Oscar! I could hear it now, ""and the Oscar goes to Daniel day-Lewis *crowd on its feet, a standing ovation awaiting his arrival on stage*"". Hugh Jackman had indeed fluctuations in his character, moments of despair, happiness all added up with singing, but the simplicity yet complexity of Lincoln's character is definitely a game winner. The steepness of his neck, his method of walking his smiling when looking on the ground that is a diverse character that is a game winner!250 minutes where you would finally use the word perfection in a concept in a movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
So-so movie,"A very slow-going film with exceptional acting, sets and costumes. The film would have benefited from an edit of at least 30 minutes, yet unfortunately at this point in Spielberg's career, he can demand final cut.Too bad for him, because it could use a major haircut. And, sometimes it's good to seek the advice of others no matter how in love you are with certain scenes and dialogue. The drama picks up in the last 1/3 of this 2.5 hour tour-de-force of pedantry, but that can't save it. You begin to feel Lincoln's pain and fatigue of this nation's Civil War sitting through the drudgery of this basically flat screenplay.It's becoming a cliché with Spielberg, who gets green-lighted on one epic after another, will probably get lots of Oscar Nominations, but in the end is simply not producing the cohesive dramatic work of his earlier days.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Bravo that man!,"Wow! Mr Day Lewis, you deserve every one of those awards that, no doubt, adorn your mantel piece at home. I forgot it was even him playing the part. What an outstanding performance. The rest of the cast was a veritable feast of faces, some in relatively minimal castings (There are no ""Small Parts""). They were all good too.I think the film probably deserves much more credit than I can give it. I don't know enough about U.S. history to judge how well Lincoln is portrayed or how the circumstances are depicted. My only real frame of reference for the man is from Bill & Ted, but anyone who has ever fought for the rights of others is a good person in my book. It also seems that he liked words and wordplay and loved to tell stories, which appeals to me. I hope that these elements are true as they really do add to the character and make him very personable.Daniel's portrayal of the man was attention grabbing, but I couldn't understand why they constantly filmed him half in shadow.I also felt that, for me personally, they garbled the explanation of the political fight. Fortunately I know just enough to get me through and to piece it together. Perhaps if it was part of my own countries heritage and as important as it seems to be to America, I would know a lot of it by heart already.
It didn't help that they all talked and shouted over each other and there was no way to keep up with the subtitles even. I'm finding that a lot lately with films and I wish that they would go back to a consideration for clearer diction, which I'm sure they could do without detracting from the realism if they tried.I should point out that political films have never really been my thing anyway and politicians poking fun at each other instead of focusing on the issue is exactly why I can't watch the news. Comedians should be on a stage, not in Parliament.Needless to say, this film doesn't rate highly on my list, but only because it doesn't really fall within my interests.

Spielberg's finest history film since Saving Private Ryan!,"That was not Daniel Day Lewis portraying Lincoln. That was the actual Lincoln. I am convinced that he went back in time and did this film, because that was Lincoln. These weren't performances in this film, these were the real life people who happen to look like actors, playing history. I have never seen history displayed more accurate in any other film.The story of Lincoln, you expect him growing up, becoming president, leading up to his assassination. Nope, this is the story of what made Lincoln a legend, as it displays the last few months of his life as he attempts to allow the 13th amendment to abolish slavery. That's the entire focus on the film. It's during the civil war, but that's not the war going on in the film. The war going on is in a room of politicians talking over it, that's the true war in this film, and it is display perfectly.Everybody grand slammed their roles. Tommy Lee Jones as Stephens, Sally Field as Lincoln's wife, even the two sons of Lincoln. History has been recreated by Spielberg with cameras, and we have the honor of reliving it.So much goes on in the film, leading up to the vote, and even though you know exactly what's going to happen, it still manages to grab you in desperation. I love history films, I loved how real they made it, and I always did. But compared to this, all of those others are children's books, this is the real deal.Daniel Day Lewis won an Oscar for his performance as Lincoln, (according to the papers). The truth is Lincoln won an Oscar for portraying himself. Daniel Day Lewis was born for this role, and nobody could have pulled it off better. This character will be remembered forever, as well as the performer. I am proud to call Daniel Day Lewis one of my favorite actors of all time. As for the directing, Spielberg never fails to amuse me, he always knows what is good to show in history.One thing I will say is, don't watch this movie if you don't understand politics, it is very heavy on politics. That being said, not all scenes are about politics, but most of it is. But trust me, if you need to take a government class to understand this film, then it's worth it.As much as I did like the film Argo, I was very disappointed that this didn't win best picture.

"""Aided and Abetted by the Purest Man in America""","Lincoln (the film) follows Lincoln (the man) throughout his crusade to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed in the House or Representatives.It provides some intriguing insight into the psyche of a legendary man, who, by all respects, was just a man. Daniel Day-Lewis portrays Lincoln as such. His performance is not flashy, but subtle in a way that haunts you afterwards. Day-Lewis transforms into Abraham Lincoln. The speech, the makeup, the posture - it's amazing.Despite some fun scenes in the House of Representatives and those trying to convince members of the House to change their vote, the movie is slow and dark.

While it does contribute to the urgency and seriousness of the matter at hand, it also cracks the facade of the film.Other characters could have been built up more.

Tommy Lee Jones (Thaddeus Stevens) has more luck with character development, but the film waits until the very end of the last act to reveal it.Overall, it's an important historical movie.

And assuming that he has handled it in a historically adequate manner, I can only marvel at how close to the people such a president can be.To walk into the White House today ""just like that"" - unimaginable.At least in this film, the president's residence is portrayed as a government building that is alive with people.The story about the 13th Amendment of the U. S. Constitution, which is supposed to prohibit slavery, is essentially or actually exclusively about politics.One wants something and needs votes - then he has to give the others something else to get them.It's a back-and-forth battle that rarely seems to be about the real thing.In the end, it has to be said that ""Lincoln"" is more for politics than history buffs.However, everyone should be thrilled by the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis (once again), who gives the famous US president a lot of dignity and definitely leaves a lasting impression. Daniel Day-Lewis definitely deserves his Oscar here.The music is so melancholy and soothing it perfectly complements the Civil War setting.A wonderful ensemble of actors complete this great biography and contemporary history, which lets us participate in the hard way to what is actually natural and should always have been!Steven Spielberg sets with perfection, Abraham Lincoln a worthy cinematic monument.A masterpiece!All in all, an all-around successful film!",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great movie!!,"This is an amazing movie, hands down. It's extremely historically accurate, down to Lincoln's surprisingly high, reedy voice. Only very small and insignificant details were altered, and this was done only to enhance the effects and clarify the events occurring in the movie. It's exceptionally interesting to view the political strife involved in the Civil War from an insider perspective, and not only that but directly from the perspective of the president that is responsible for it all. Almost more impressive is the visual accuracy. Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Fields are visually quite similar to the original Lincoln and Mrs. Lincoln, as are, I am sure, many of the other characters. Day-Lewis is amazing in his portrayal, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt never ceases to amaze.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln,7/10 - interesting historical drama with convincing acting and a long run time,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great movie from the man!,"Spielberg's recent output has been inconsistent. Which is completely normal but he operated on a different level for so long that seeing not great movies from him is weird. But with his constant game changing career from every spectrum of movie making he could make crap the rest of his life and it wouldn't effect his legacy.Anyway, Lincoln was a great movie. Spielberg at the top of his game. What could have played out like a slow drama plays out with quick dialogue and a fast story. Of course any American or human will be invested in this story. And we all know the basic story from school. But what we get to see here is the real struggle to end slavery. The race against the clock of ending the war versus holding for freedom, his son joining and the pressure that he got from all different sides. And how he held true to the right thing and won. Not because good always triumphs but because he was smart and knew how to navigate the politics to free slaves, end the war and unite the country.You really see the struggle that people went through to fulfill the promise of our forefathers that all men are created equal. This was an issue that they couldn't tackle themselves and left for future generations to ratify and Lincoln did it. And it cost him his life to do so. Not only top notch entertainment but this movie does well to remind us of what people did to improve all of our lives and that the right thing isn't easy to do.Life changes so much over the generations that it's hard to put yourself into their shoes and see why they did what they did. People look back on those people as racist and wonder why they didn't abolish slavery earlier. This movie helps to show what it was like then and how hard change is. America was born on the backs of the old ways and the change of freedom and equality is a battle that takes many generations. Good people have to continue to fight for this until the ignorant thinking is bred out. And also we see here that the way politics work is the same as today. Unfortunately.Enough can't be said about DDL. I was well informed for almost ten 10 before finally seeing this and I was still knocked out. Actually I don't even think it was him in this movie. His voice didn't sound anything like him. I think really what his acting did was bring the Abe Lincoln to life that we have heard about. It was on the page but he acted so genuine and was so likable and soft that he came across as everything I think he's like. Seems like you couldn't talk to him without him changing your mind or understanding his side.Of course like every Spielberg movie the cast was amazing. He really picks out unknowns, well knowns and people that you love that are just floating around that you couldn't name.Good history lesson and a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A new level for Daniel Day-Lewis,"This film tells the efforts of President Abraham Lincoln to approve in Congress a constitutional amendment to end slavery in the United States. Directed by Steven Spielberg, has a Tony Kushner's script, and Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role.Its not a novelty that the abolition of slavery in the U.S. was made incredibly late compared to other countries, such as France, the United Kingdom or Portugal (the small European country was one of the first to promote large-scale slavery but was also one of the first countries in the world to abolish it completely). See this movie elucidates us the reason: the economic strength of slavery was huge and during the civil war there was a fierce opposition to the abolitionist campaigns, even in the North. Lincoln is portrayed as being immune to everything and everyone, struggling to make the amendment pass. But the racism was omnipresent in U.S. that time, and some scenes of this film forget that and put the President in direct contact with colored people, something that probably never happened in formal contexts. Despite some partiality in the way Lincoln was portrayed, and some historical inaccuracies, the script is very good and show us the real bureaucracy that, even today, was necessary to approves the amendment. The performance of the actors was also good, particularly Day-Lewis, who almost metamorphosed himself to play the iconic U.S. president and deserved the Oscar for Best Actor who won with that. Also the costumes, sets and makeup were at the highest level. John Williams signed the soundtrack, as usually happens in Spielberg's films, but it didn't shine as intensely as often shines.An good film that addresses a turning point in American history, this film has good quality but is far from being one of the best of Spielberg. However, undoubtedly marks a new stage in Daniel Day- Lewis's career, which becomes the only actor in film history to receive the Oscar for Best Actor three times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Lincoln... As Seen Through The Rosy Spectacles of Steven Spielberg,"Spielberg's Lincoln is subtly inaccurate, and for that reason it is insidious and dangerous. There are also glaring omissions in the story line which serve as a detraction. To John Q. Public, who probably has a cursory knowledge concerning Lincoln and the Civil War, this film will reinforce the biased Union perspective that is generally taught in secondary education. The skewed prism that Spielberg looks through in making this film is an anathema to any historian who has done a scintilla of research concerning the war.The centerpiece of Spielberg's Lincoln involves the political machinations concerning the passage of the 13th Amendment of the Constitution. To Spielberg's credit he paints William Seward and Lincoln as the conniving politicians they both were. Their ""ends justify the means"" approach to the passage of the amendment is depicted without any remorse concerning the morality of buying off potential undecided votes. It is Seward who conspires with Lincoln suggesting that they employ the services of W.N. Bilbo, and others, to corrupt the process and pass the amendment. Basically, Lincoln finds himself twenty votes short for passage of the amendment. Through the auspices of Bilbo and his band of rogues, they systematically bribe each undecided Congressman before finally obtaining the requisite number required for passage.Spielberg's Lincoln is very passionate about the 13th Amendment. But does this passion actually jibe with what transpired during the war? Lincoln's famous quotation to the New York Tribune on August 22, 1862 would seem to contradict Spielberg's curious passion of 1865. In 1862 Lincoln stated, ""I would save the Union. I would save it the shortest way under the Constitution. The sooner the national authority can be restored; the nearer the Union will be ""the Union as it was."" If there be those who would not save the Union, unless they could at the same time save slavery, I do not agree with them. If there be those who would not save the Union unless they could at the same time destroy slavery, I do not agree with them. My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the UnionShould we believe the Lincoln of 1862, or the Lincoln of 1865? Lincoln cultists would argue that Lincoln simply evolved to this more ""enlightened"" position concerning slavery. However, it's my belief that's much too easy a jump to make.In Spielberg's Lincoln no mention is ever made of Lincoln's plan to repatriate slaves, and other blacks, to Liberia. In 1862 Lincoln invited a group of free black men into the White House and requested that they lead by example and leave the country. The men were greeted by the Federal Commissioner of Emigration J. Mitchell, who explained that a sum of money had been apportioned by Congress ""for the purpose of aiding the colonization in some country of the people, or potion of them African decent"". Lincoln is quoted as asserting, "" You and we are of different races. We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races. This physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both and affords a reason at least why we should be separated. It is better for us both, therefore, to be separate"". That assertion is a decidedly different tenor than the movie attempts to convey.Another highly debatable, accuracy challenged segment in the film is the final meeting (in early 1865) between the Confederate Peace Commissioners and Lincoln. At the meeting Spielberg's Lincoln asserts slavery is dead. The Confederate commissioners, led by Vice President Alexander Stephens, break off the negotiations ostensibly based on Lincoln's comments. Stephens subsequently replies that the South's agrarian economy is based on slavery, and that abolishing slavery would have a crippling effect on its existence. In actuality, that meeting was much different than what occurred in the film. What did occur, and is verifiable, was that Stephens asked: ""Is there no way of putting an end to the present trouble, and bringing about a restoration of general good will and harmony?"" Lincoln replied, "" There is but one way... for those who are resisting the laws of the union to cease that resistance"". He offered 400 million compensation for the freed slaves, but emphasized: The restoration of the Union is a ""sine qua non"" with me.Spielberg's Lincoln, portrayed in the film by Daniel Day Lewis, attempts to depict Lincoln in a folksy, homespun manner. Lincoln uses his charm with friends and detractors invoking whimsical yarns at every opportunity. In reality, the stories are used to obfuscate the real issues at hand. At one point in the film one of Lincoln's own cabinet members, Edwin Stanton, becomes so frustrated with the incessant ""yarns"" he abruptly leaves Lincoln's presence. Of course Spielberg's motivation in spotlighting the yarns is to create a more sympathetic character in Lincoln. Spielberg's Lincoln also elicits sympathy through glimpses into his dysfunctional marriage to Mary Todd Lincoln, portrayed by Sally Field. Spielberg's mining for sympathy is a disservice to anyone who has done any real historical research and is aware that the war, which killed over 600,000 of his fellow American citizens, could have been potentially avoided by Lincoln.",2.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Incredible!,"I'm just gonna warn you, anyone who's not into history will not like Lincoln. If you're into history, specifically that time era (1860's) then you'll love what you're about to go see. The movie is all about Abraham Lincoln and his struggle with the 13th amendment. The only problem this movie really has is it's very talky. Lot's of talking and talking and talking... some people may not be entertained. I brought a girl to go see this and to say the least she was bored out of her mind while I was so into it. The directing is phenomenal, since you have Spielberg doing that it comes to no surprise. Same goes with the writing. Tony Kushner took six years to write the script and I have to say it was well worth it! Every line is so well thought out and every character performs it perfectly. Daniel Day-Lewis does an amazing job as Lincoln and the supporting cast is perfect. All in all I would defiantly give this a shot, but just a heads up it is long (about 2 and a half hours) and may be considered boring to some.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It changed everything happening in the United States, democracy, and the world!Thank God there was such a leader as Lincoln. He bravely fought against the tyranny of racism and all that comes with it. That slavery ever happened in a free country is absurd to begin with. I wish that people would let people be free.

One of the greatest Historical dramas ever,"I'm not a huge fan of Steven Spielberg at all, and I've never made it secret. He's talented yes, but the sentimentality and formulaic mainstream tendencies are always present in every one of his films, to different extents. Lincoln turned out to be a really fantastic film though, and is probably Spielberg's best film since Schindler's List and probably one of the few ones I have ever loved from him.The reason the film works so well is because it has a really great screenplay at work. Tony Kushner writes this story like a pro, simply said. The dialogue is nearly always riveting, never dry, and is able to inject humor in all of the right places while still clearly defining so many of the characters that weave in and out of the story. It also wisely doesn't go to too many places and instead is clearly focused on one aspect of Lincoln's life and American history in general. Because of that, I would say this is a writers' film more than a directors' one, and in all honesty I am surprised Steven Spielberg chose it. There's not much indication that he's behind the camera, and that's great for me. Instead of feeling like a signature Spielberg film, it still manages to be tightly calculated and touching in all of the right moments because of his restrained directing. In the moments that do aim for something more moving, it feels more honest and doesn't feel hokey. I am incredible grateful for that, especially after the horrid War Horse last year.The ensemble here is magnificent. Sally Field seemed out of place at first, but I warmed up to her as it went along and her way of playing up the infamous Mary Todd Lincoln. Other great performances include David Straitham, with a gentle and compassionate performance, Gordon Levitt, who I've never liked much but was pretty great here, John Hawkes, Michael Stuhlbarg, James Spader, and Lee Pace among the best. But the film belongs to two men, Day Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones. Lewis is magnificent here, invoking the personality that so many have heard of yet never witnessed. Regardless, it's a different type of performance from the one he played 5 years ago as Daniel Plainview, and because it's simply not as physically or emotionally commanding, it won't be the type of performance everyone can get behind for awards. But he was perfect, and as of now is the best male performance of the year (although I still have a lot to see). Tommy Lee Jones is probably just as fantastic, stealing every scene he is in and injecting a dose of power, warmth, and charisma to everything he touches. I have yet to see most of the actors in contention for Supporting Actor, but I would be ecstatic if Jones wins it because regardless, it's an incredibly compelling performance.Ultimately, I think even those who aren't fond of Spielberg can enjoy it. He gives material room to breathe and instead of forcing every dose of sentimentality into every frame of certain scenes, he makes the film work beautifully, showcasing the fantastic acting and tight writing. This is highly recommended, and one of the best films of the year, as well as one of the best historical films I've ever seen.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
absorbing but a little bloodless,"This drama of political intrigue has much to recommend it. The story of the passage of the 13th amendment in the house involves a surprising amount of chicanery and political fixing, and it is refreshing to see politics shown as both a devious profession while showing it as one that can do good. And Tommy Lee Jones gives a first rate performance as a Republican radical (back when that was a good thing).Jones is also notable for creating a sense of a flesh and blood person, which cannot be said for Daniel Day Lewis' Lincoln. It's a good performance, giving you a shrewd but folksy man determined to strike a blow for history, but Spielberg films Lewis much in the way a biblical epic films Jesus. This, and Lewis' careful, overly perfect delivery, make Lincoln more icon than man, and at times he comes across as a Disney animatronic Lincoln.The movie feels very much like it wants to be the movie about Lincoln school kids see, and so it works hard to be faithful to history. But it also takes pains to be firmly on the right side of history. The few black people in the movie are better spoken than the white people; every one of them speaks like a Yale graduate. I'm not saying there weren't many well-spoken, educated black people at the time, but I cannot help but suspect they weren't *all* like that. Lincoln is given a halo, but I can't help but believe - and perhaps this is simply my own cynicism - that his motives were more complex, his temper less even, his movements less assured, than what you see here. Jones, Lee Pace as a fiery Democrat, and the lead fixer seemed far more interesting as characters than Lincoln, because they seemed far more like real people.But then, that's how Lincoln is always portrayed. Lincoln as human being is rare, although Hal Holbrooke, one of the many effective stars in this film, played a more flesh and blood version of the man many years ago.While this could have been better as a movie, it makes for an excellent history lesson, both informative and consistently engaging. It is not a great film, but it's a great thing to show to high school kids.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"When Hollywood gets it right, you have a ""Lincoln""","Wow, that's what both of us said when regaining our speech after viewing this great film yesterday. I had seriously lost all hope that Hollywood could produce a serious film: a film like other nations seem to turn out with aplomb. But they caught me out yesterday with this marvelous movie that had no bloodshed, no violence of any kind, no talking animals or human figures that mouthed the lines of well known accents. No, this was a serious movie that required some modicum of grey-matter to follow all that was happening as well as a certain amount of old fashioned schoolbook knowledge. On all these accounts a definitely un-American movie. If J. Edgar were around he would have brought all the major players before the House Un-American Activities Committee for reasons that only he could fathom.I believe, and rightly so, that all the major actors should win Academy Awards: Day-Lewis, Field and Jones. They are simply the standouts but there was not a weak actor in the entire movie. My personal favourite was Tommy Lee Jones but that is only preference. Spielberg should win as director because he brought this bunch together and moulded (I know, I know—it is a trite word but...) the cast into something beyond what it could/should have been.I thought also that the screenplay was tremendous; the Set Decoration was truly marvelous and the lighting—the lighting, how do you recreate that felling of muted light that would have been the norm at that time?

Not A Typical Biopic,"Lincoln the movie, directed by Steven Speilburg follows the President whilst the American civil war is raging on. While it is well known to all United States citizens that Lincoln is the president who ""freed"" the slaves, the fight in which he went through to get this freedom is usually brushed over. Lincoln highlights the internal struggles that the President underwent when dealing with the war, both in the House and in his home. With the pressure from everyone to end the civil war, decisions were very tough for Lincoln at this time in his presidency, but he believed that one thing would end all the fighting and unnecessary death once and for all- the passage of the thirteenth amendment. This amendment called for the freedom of slaves in the states of rebellion. Lincoln is a very educational movie for those who may not know much about American history or the nitty gritty reality of the civil war, but personally I found the movie hard to get into. The ""action"" was very melodramatic for my taste. Not to say that Spielberg's creative direction wasn't good, I enjoyed that unlike other biopics Lincoln was centered around a crucial moment in the protagonist's life rather than a story of their entire life.

Lost Lincoln,"This was an extremely boring movie, and frankly I am extremely disappointed and disgusted, based on all of the media gaga that has been swirling around it and the amount of money that went into making it. As much as I love Obama, how much more could a move hide behind political correctness, and stick to a worn out script that has been shoved down our throats since grade one? And this so called ""script"" was based upon accused plagiarist Doris Kerns Goodwin's ""Lincoln"" biography! Shame on Stephen Spielberg for using this source material and for instead not finding historical documentation of what would exemplify the humanity in the characters of Lincoln and his wife Mary Todd. Has anyone ever seen a human Lincoln? Not me (unless I include the one I saw at Disneyland). Spielberg's characterizations in this botched and failed effort were extremely stiff, unyielding and extremely unbelievable. Did we ever see anything in the movie that portrayed any intimacy between him and his wife? For God's sake, we do know that they had sex with and loved each other! And, if I wanted to witness a replication of the exact scenes that took place between him and congress, I would have goggled it, or watched C-Span. It also ticks me off that he had to include his trademark Spielbergian light LaLa in some of the scenes here.....dude, this isn't ""ET"". What a waste!!!!!! And to not give Sally Field any good scenes in this movie is a crime!!!! Shame, Shame, Shame!!!!!!

this movie is a masterpiece,"The quality of a film is a funny thing. It's not just the writing, some terrific scripts don't get translated well and some very iffy scripts turn out pretty amazing final products. By the same token it's also not just the acting or directing either. What makes a film a truly exemplary work of art has an air of mystery to it. It takes all of the elements we commonly think of like writing, acting, directing, editing, cinematography and a dozen other things, mixes them together, and bakes them into something distinct of the individual ingredients.Some actors and directors seem to have a nose for how to mix those ingredients and experience success well above the norm, but there are never any guarantees, not even for the goats like Spielberg. But when it does come together you can sense it. There's a feeling you get while watching, a little thought that tickles the back of your mind that you're witnessing something unique and special. Being well received is really just about many people seeing and enjoying a film and some are enjoyed by lots of people and then quickly fade and are largely forgotten, but masterpieces tend to stick around and get ""discovered"" by audiences over and over because they have something engaging and difficult to replicate that echoes over time.Lincoln's something special is that it seems to open a window onto a small but significant period of the life of one of our greatest presidents, and succeeds to such a degree that you'll feel like in some sense you knew the great man: his genius and his pain, his humor and his struggles, and his morality and resolve. Of course, however well researched, and Lincoln was extensively researched, in the end it is an interpretation, not actually a window. But the genius of the film is that the illusion is so vibrant, so complete, that you'll swear it must have somehow been a window.Daniel Day-Lewis captured such a convincing vision of the man that Spielberg was moved to tears when filming wrapped and Lewis finally stepped out of character, because Spielberg realized he would never get to ""talk"" to Lincoln again. That's how strong the illusion was, and Spielberg managed to capture that essence throughout the film. There are so many great scenes to choose from, but for me the scene I always come back to is when Lincoln is struggling with a difficult decision and talks about Euclid's common notions and axioms, a sort of foundational logic for mathematics written around 300 BCE, and integrates one of the basic concepts into reasoning about fairness and equality. In the scene you can feel the flow of Lincoln's thoughts, see on his face how he reaches his risky but principled decision, and it is amazing.The supporting cast seems caught in the spell along with the director and contribute flawless performances that contribute to the illusion, no small feat given the size of the cast and number of well known actors. There will probably be other films about Lincoln, great films even, but I don't think there will ever be another film that creates an illusion as powerful as Lincoln that gives the viewer the opportunity to see the man, the father, the leader, steering our nation through the greatest crises it's ever experienced, and the doubt and uncertainty and sheer human cost incurred by so many in enacting that change.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"An excellent, extremely well acted 13th Ammendment drama","4/4Some argue that Spielberg is no longer at the zenith of his career, and that might even be true. He isn't churning out summer blockbusters like Jaws or Indiana Jones anymore, but he still makes remarkable dramas. Lincoln is a perfect example of this. It's truly one of the better historical films I've seen.Daniel Day-Lewis is the best possible cast for Lincoln. He is able to portray every edge of his role. He can (much like the real life Lincoln) fluidly transition between the serious president who will Stop at nothing to end the war and pass the 13th Ammendment, and the laid-back, down-to-Earth storyteller he was known to be off the job. It's very rare for a man to possess kindness, reason, a good reputation and the ability to persuade simultaneously the way Lincoln did. It's even rarer to see a man with such virtue as Lincoln have been done justice on screen. Lewis hones the role and does just that.The long running-time may (understandably, given the subject matter) repel some viewers with less patience and love for films in general. Cinephiles and history-buffs alike will find that the 150 minutes speed by all to quickly, not giving the proper historical resolution to Lincoln's assassination and other aspects of his life. As far as excitement, this movie falls between full-on war films such as Glory (1989), and Ken Burn's The Civil War. It's deliberate but holds your interest.Overall, I think that the movie has mass-appeal and Spielberg did a fair job marketing it. It's not a perfect movie, but it's truly great. I think we can agree that Lewis was phenomenal in the role of Lincoln, and that this is Spielberg's best effort in 15 years.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
LINCOLN: Au Contraire,"The reviews are glowing ... but the film is not. The performances are good - and in the case of T. Lee Jones and D. Day Lewis, terrific. It's almost as though the President has returned to life. The other perfs are somewhat canned. And, though some are calling the film Spielberg's ""maturing"" as a Director, really it's more like he phoned it in. There was none of the ""something new,"" or an angle or perspective, or a gem technique such as the color frame(s) of the child in ""Schlindler's List,"" or the final, powerful panning shot before credits roll in ""Munich.""And then, the trite, saccharine, contrived chorale of the illiterate soldiers reciting back to Lincoln the Gettysburg Address in the Opening. Highly unlikely. Disney-like. Did they have NPR in their knapsacks? Or even a newspaper with the text (they'd already memorized)? Weird.Lincoln deserved a better effort from the Director. Even the nat sound was like something from a '50's Western. The 1950's. Williams music? Something he had in a file cabinet somewhere. The music was restrained, properly probably, but it contributed little. The cinematography? Dark and contrasty. But at least that was intriguing and atmospheric as one contemplates the actual lighting of the day, night, and time.On top - or bottom - of this, the movie was tooooooo long for comfort in the multiplex environment of today. Already, at the end of its first week, the picture was relegated to the smallest screen and auditorium. It will best be seen later on Blu-ray, after it has a run on PBS, where it belonged. Ken Burns ""Dust Bowl"" topped this (as did his ""Civil War"") ... Steven. On a Blu-ray Director's cut it could have been longer - because then one can stop the player for a break, or not.This is the second recent Miss for Spielberg, the last one being the Disney'esque ""War Horse"" where the begged-for ending was missed, where the soldier SHOULD have returned with grandpa and the horse back to the granddaughter who also loved the horse ... and then they TWO go riding into the cinematic sunset (remember, at the end) to the soldier's home, or anywhere, leaving it to the audience to imagine what might happily happen next. This was the kind of film it was, one that should have circled back to a happy, loose-ends tied-up ending - and Spielberg missed it. It was a horse story folks.As for LINCOLN, it could have been performed on a stage nearly to the same effect. But this is film. And, for Spielberg, it was lacking.One scene that does capture an essence better than most is Lincoln's ride through the carnage of the War. It's easy to understand that Lincoln would struggle with Depression, as has been reported. What an unholy mess in which to be mired with little in that day and place besides alcohol to relieve the horror, the sadness, the nation so sadly asunder. The theatre maybe? Even that was a tragic idea ...Bravo to D. Day Lewis though. One wonders if his voice was that of Lincoln, a little tinny. A line of dialogue somewhere could have clarified that. As for Lincoln the man, he was easy to find in Lewis' performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Flawless,"It feels bizarre to actually put this into words, but I believe this is Steven Speilberg's finest film. In no other film are the cinematography, performances, and script in such lockstep perfection. Although I call it flawless, I will say that the soundtrack is not one of the best (I cannot recall a single part of it), and I can see how its length and plot may not satisfy all viewers. But, simply as performance art, this is incredible.On one hand, you have Spielberg's mastery of the camera. Few directors are as good, and here Spielberg mixes his mastery with more natural light and soft lighting than we've ever really seen from him. This is an exceptionally well-shot and well-composed film. It is incredibly detailed, and that reflects attention to the background as well. The extras, the set design, everything are just top-notch.And then the performances. There isn't a bad one in the lot. The film relies on monologues perhaps a bit too heavily and feels like a stage play to an extent, but that is part of the performance of politics, and everyone here is a master at it, from DDL in front all the way to the smaller roles like Jared Harris as Grant or Jackie Earle Haley as Alexander Stephens. I don't even know the actor who plays Robert E Lee in a maybe 2 minute non-speaking role, but even he lands it.There is just so much depth here, and you can see aspects of so much of Spielberg's past work teaching him how to produce this film. We get its weight from Schindler's List. We get its courtroom drama from Amistad. We get the violence and human reflection from Saving Private Ryan. We get the cinematography from Jaws. It just feels to me as if Spielberg's career was building to this moment, and he put a lot of that history into it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Just a flat-line....,"I don't know if it's because I'm young or what it might be, that makes me think this film was boring. I liked one thing about the movie and that was that I got to know Abraham a lot more. And I could see all the difficult choices he had to face. I've always admired Mr. Lincoln so I'm still glad I saw the movie, despite the fact that the movie didn't contain any ""action"". It was just a flat-line.Steven Spielberg is famous for making great movies, but this was not his best one. Although I'm surprised Daniel Day-Lewis did such an amazing job, I was choked over how good he played, or should I say ""lived"" Lincoln.It's a movie you should watch because of the contents, and the history and importance of Abraham Lincoln, and what he did. I believe any film lovers should watch it and be aware of its many Oscar nominations. (I personally wouldn't recommend it to any teenagers.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Daniel Day-Lewis Paints An Image Of Lincoln To Last 100 Years.,"I can't remember what image I had of Abraham Lincoln prior to seeing this film for the first time. I'm sure I had my own ideas about how he looked, how he sounded when he spoke, his demeanor, etc. I've read about Lincoln - I knew he was said to be soft-spoken, with a sometimes high-pitched voice. I knew he was supposed to be tall, with a bit of a 'stoop' in his posture. Now, when I think of Abraham Lincoln, all I see is Daniel Day-Lewis as 'Lincoln' (2012). Day-Lewis captured all of those qualities I read about, as well as the look from the paintings we have all seen. Spielberg set an appropriate tone and I liked the darkness in many of the scenes. This combination made me feel like I was back in time, witnessing the real Lincoln. And, it's not just Lincoln, but the entire ensemble cast are well-costumed and in top form.This film isn't for everyone, and it's easy to be mislead as to what this film actually is represents. This is not necessarily a civil war tale, or even a tale about slavery. This film is about the legislative process in early democratic America. It's about the law v morality. And, although I love the movie, I fell asleep the first two times I tried to watch it. It is a little longer than it needs to be and the scenes with Lincoln and his youngest son could have been cut to save about 10 minutes.It may not be a perfect film, but after experiencing it, this is the image I will have of Abraham Lincoln for the rest of my life. That happens sometimes, when great actors take on great historical roles. Daniel Day-Lewis has created a new cultural frame-of-reference for Abraham Lincoln.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"Literate, well-made, but unmoving and unexciting...","Try as he might, director Steven Spielberg cannot get the emotional rivers running beneath this portrait of the 16th President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln, and his efforts to obtain passage for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution in the House of Representatives in the year 1865, which would formally abolish slavery in the country. Oscar-winner Daniel Day-Lewis is predictably solid as the story-telling Lincoln, usually undermining his own anger and frustration with wry humor and a kind of cracker-barrel wisdom, and Sally Field is quite good (if somewhat uneasily cast) as the First Lady, an emotionally unstable Mary Todd Lincoln. Unfortunately, the supporting performances disappoint, particularly Tommy Lee Jones, a hole in the screen as Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, and Jackie Earle Haley, looking lost among the roses as Confederate States Vice President Alexander H. Stephens. Spielberg takes a homespun approach to the film's visual palette, allowing cinematographer Janusz Kaminski to dote on shots such as Lincoln and child in a rocking chair, bathed in a lemony glow. However, despite some prickly dialogue exchanges, the verbal standoffs between adversaries are surprisingly stilted. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A most excellent look at a personage of historical significance,"Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show as the title character in LINCOLN, but by all rights, the film itself could have been named ""AMENDMENT XIII"" as the second act's energy, as well as most of the third, is focused on the debate in the House to abolish slavery nearly leaving Lincoln himself as just a witness to history while a cast of character actors from screens both big and small pound tables and chests alike in a grandiose fashion.Director Steven Spielberg, and his long-time cinematic director of photography Janusz Kaminski, created a gorgeous movie where they carefully and beautifully frame each shot allowing the audience to play historical witness. Similar to Spielberg's work in MUNICH, the camera is expertly placed, rarely moving, allowing for a perfect spectacle of a scene: be it the aftermath of a bloody battle, the always-smoky rooms where speech itself has somewhere to hide, a rocking chair on a rickety floor that looks ancient even for 1865, or the bright, winter sunlight filtered through the gauze of a window furnishing or a washed-out flag. Likewise, Day-Lewis himself is always framed, the camera accenting on his height, catching the lines in the gray of his face as he bears the weight of a nation divided playing equal parts father, preacher, lawyer and, most of all, grand storyteller.The film, however, keenly focuses on those individual glances but the overall story itself is not as put-together. A series of poignant, incredibly-acted, well-constructed scenes are displayed; each scene a marvelous production complete with conflict, character exposition and beautiful dialogue. Yet these scenes are nearly staged as free-standing productions by themselves and, other than the overarching story detailing the end of Civil War and the proposition of Amendment XIII, miss any flow connecting them and strengthening that overall narrative.Again, it is the presence of Day-Lewis who provides the human touch to the drama of politics. Amidst the yelling and the smoke and the death that incorporates nearly every scene, Day-Lewis' Abraham Lincoln has the ability to smile and, in a move completely foreign to modern-day presidents, sit and speak with the everyday man. He knows this is who is fighting his war and also knows that these very same people will find their own strength to rebuild America. Like a grandfather, he has stories to tell bringing relevance and peace to the chaos of the day, just not his with own family where a slightly-miscast Sally Field, playing Mrs. Lincoln, adds embarrassment and strife while Joseph Gordon- Levitt, as Lincoln's eldest, wants to be the attention-grabbing rebellious son but at least maintains his nobility, even when being ignored.Spielberg elevates the spirit of the man, in a similar manner to what he accomplished with Oskar Schindler, by bringing relevance and importance to that man's place in history. Spielberg shows a man who was able to work both with and around Congress, wanted peace badly enough to fight for it and was taken much too abruptly leaving any future potential into the smoke of history.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Great man, pretty good film","Being not part of the American school system (and indeed, having not having had much of an education at all) the most I knew about Abraham Lincoln was the guy in Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure who advised the students in a Most Triumphant speech towards the end to ""PARTY ON, DUDES!!"" You might think ""PHILISTINE!! How could you not know about his contribution to ending modern day slavery, or his untimely end in a theatre at the hand of one John Wilkes Booth?"" to which I can only shrug my shoulders and advise them to visit the two pathetic establishments where I spent most of my formative years. They'd soon change their tune.So, here's Daniel Day Lewis in full regalia... bushy beard, top hat, wearing stilts... (Or is he actually that tall...) Does he capture the essence of Mr Lincoln? Who knows... but he certainly acts like I imagine the guy would, and he looks the part... so let's give him a pass. Abraham, according to how this film represents him, had a tendency to tell long stories of his personal experiences, which charmed and inspired everyone around him. He was well loved by pretty much all the population, and just coming into his second term as President. Then he decided to put a bill through Congress to end ownership of black people, and all Hell broke loose.There was already a war going on between the South and the North, and this further exacerbated the situation because the South wanted to keep their plantations going... and they needed slaves to do that. So somehow Mr Lincoln had to perform the difficult task of getting the two sides to agree to peace, AND freeing ethnic minorities from the toil of the whip. No mean feat. But somehow he did it... (No SPOILER here, just read your history book) in no small way thanks to his gravitas as a leader, and his determination that every man should be equal. Alas, a bullet put an end to him soon afterwards, but all the ammunition in all the arsenals in the world couldn't stop his dream from achieving reality. (Sorry, stealing a tribute to Martin Luther King there. Still appropriate, I reckon)This is the kind of movie I can imagine watching as part of exam coursework than for true entertainment purposes. It's very informative, and made with a true appreciation of the subject. It is also incredibly long-winded, and with not a lot to carry it for long periods other than Day Lewis's (admittedly superb) performance, things can get a trifle dull. We learn Lincoln had a fractious relationship with his wife, and his son threatens to sever ties with him over his desire to be a soldier. All interesting stuff, but not quite enough to pad out the lloonngg running time. So I 'get' what Spielberg is trying to do... I just didn't feel all that exhilarated afterwards, like if I'd watched a defining piece of cinema. Oh well... you're still a legend in my eyes Abe... 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Borefest,"To make it short: I was bored about that movie already after the first 15 minutes, and from there it went only downwards. Maybe it's because I'm not American, so the person, Lincoln, didn't trigger any patriotic feelings in me. This said, no idea what was superior about DDL's performance compared with every other Oscar nominee this year, and no comparison to his fantastic acting in ""gangs of N.Y."", for example. Or ""there will be blood"". Hell, actually any movie he ever was in, was better than this snore inducing piece I had to endure. I was there with friends, that's the only reason why I didn't leave the cinema before the end. I regretted having spent time and money on this film, so bad it came over for me, and about half of my friends agreed with me, with just one exception. One of my friends found DDL's acting awesome, but the movie itself failed to impress him as well.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Lincoln is thoughtful, poignant","Review by Ray Silveyra www.thatsmye.comLincoln is thoughtful,poignant, and with our nation at one of its most important elections,this is a movie that is relevant and important. Though it may not reach the heights to be spoken in association with Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, with Lincoln, Steven Spielberg adds yet another classic to an unprecedented cannon.Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, the film follows the President toward the end of the civil war, as he tries to gain passage of the 13th amendment, abolishing slavery. The Civil War is ultimately a backdrop to the struggles Lincoln faces with a divided Congress, an impatient cabinet, and a family that is often treated second to a nation.The film features a stellar cast that includes Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee-Jones, Joseph Gordin Levitt, and David Strathairn. The entire cast is utterly superb in their roles, but Tommy Lee-Jones (as Thaddeus Stevens) absolutely commands the screen, delivering his lines with a whipping intensity and a demeanor that is quiet, controlled and critically believable Look, we all know the outcome, we know that the amendment passes, but Spielberg manages to enthrall his audience not from the passage of the amendment but rather, the reasoning behind the amendment. Spielberg so perfectly captures the political arena, that the audience will, without a doubt, be more emotionally invested in its story than any other thing on screen, Lincoln included. Unfortunately, when the movie isn't dealing with the political plot, it tends to drag, only to be picked up again by the political battle that controls the movie. Consequently, when the political plot is resolved, it is difficult to keep further interest in a remaining story that feels secondary and undeveloped. Sadly, yet appropriately, Lincoln dies with the resolution of the political plot. The film's greatest strength, and perhaps its biggest downfall, is that the Amendment, as it was in real life, is bigger than Lincoln himself.At a time when our nation is deciding its next president and debating the validity of equal marriage, affirmative action, workplace equality, and undocumented immigration, it is appropriate that Lincoln, with the grandeur of Grade-A performances and the epic quality one would expect from a Spielberg film, is outshone by a political battle that is important to know and relevant to apply in our present. In one of his most fragile moments, Daniel Day-Lewis's Abraham Lincoln, asks, ""Do we choose to be born? Or do we fit into the time we're born into?"" The film may seem self-righteous to some, yet to most it will be evident that Lincoln is an intense, near-perfect film, that, now, more than ever, necessarily fits into the time is it born into.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
story of the past and present,"There are couple of things to discuss about Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"". Despite what the title implies, the movie is not the life story of the sixteenth president. Rather, it focuses on late 1864 and early 1865, when the reelected Lincoln was trying to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed to outlaw slavery. What we see is how Lincoln had to scratch a few backs to ensure the amendment's passage. Similar things happen to this day.But there's an even more important clear analogy to the present day. When the proposal to ban slavery gets brought before congress, a number of congressmen attack it as things like ""an attack on freedom"" or ""an overreach of government power"". In later years, the reactionary forces in the United States said the same sorts of things about the Civil Rights Act, and today the Tea Party types say the same sorts of things about today's social progress.Does the movie have any drawbacks? Well, there's not much look at the war itself, except for a scene of disembodied limbs on a battlefield, and there's not much look at slavery, except for a photo of a whipped slave. Of course, one could make the argument that these aren't supposed to be the main focus of what Lincoln had to do in order to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed.Above all else, the movie shows Abraham Lincoln's human side. The sixteenth president saw that ending slavery would take significant ambition, and he did what he felt that he had to in order to carry out this objective. It's not Spielberg's best movie, but it's definitely up there. Daniel Day-Lewis brings a fine embodiment to Abraham Lincoln, as does Sally Field as his wife Mary. Providing impeccable support are Joseph Gordon-Levitt, David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, James Spader, and Tommy Lee Jones.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fails the goosebump test,"Spielberg misses the mark with his long-anticipated take on one of the US's most beloved presidents. Daniel Day-Lewis gives an almighty performance based on morsels of historical information, but is let down by a surprisingly narrow narrative. The film fails, or rather does not triumph, because it is a condensed epic, based on the book 'Team of Rivals: The political genius of Abraham Lincoln' by Doris Kearns Goodwin, and dubiously adapted by Tony Kushner.Seldom boring, but often mundane, Lincoln, like the book, is about the arduous and uncertain process by which slavery was abolished. We see the political machinations needed to cover up Lincoln's personal abhorrence of slavery with the pretence that ending it would end the civil war.Spielberg should have kept to the title and made a straight up bio of the great man's life. Perhaps then, the 150-minute run time would be justified. The film ends up being a run-of-the-mill political drama with moments of cringeworthy triumphalism, notably in the closing scenes, where votes are cast to pass the thirteenth amendment.Pursuing DD-L for the lead role was Spielberg's smartest directorial contribution. No one – no one – could have played Lincoln other than the master craftsman. It takes a genius to play one. The startling Noam Chomsky-esque voice, pensive gestures and body language control all conspire to evoke the supreme intelligence and acumen of this exceptional man. DD-L's physical likeness is a happy coincidence.Sally Field is noticeable in a minor role as Lincoln's wife. I liked the scene where she undermines Tommy Lee Jones's character, a profane, wig-wearing republican, by reminding him how powerful her husband is and how impotent he is. It isn't necessary to state but I feel compelled to remark just how beautiful she is for a lady in her mid sixties who, incidentally, has been acting since the mid-60s.In a brilliantly written and played scene, DD-L intellectually justifies ending slavery by recalling Euclid's first common notion of mechanical law: things which are equal to the same thing are equal to each other. Sadly, the theory cannot be applied to the film. DD-L's force far outweighs that of the material. (It won't stop him from making history by winning his third 'best lead actor' Oscar.)My recurring thought was: why make another guilt-ridden film which attempts to absolve the white male for slavery? Why not do as Tarantino has done and make a film which empowers the black male instead?",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Astonishing achievement,"Having read the book first (took me actually couple weeks:) I couldn't wait to see this movie. In short - I couldn't have been more satisfied. It follows the book closely, reflecting the actual events that happened during the last months of Civil war as precisely as they could be described.Already the beginning will wet your eyes with the Gettysburg address smartly inputted to the movie and of course ends with Stanton's famous quote after AL dies. I'm very happy Daniel Day Lewis accepted the offer and portrayed AL with such great intensity and power as AL rightly deserves. I replayed some scenes (his talk with Mr. Stevens, argument with his wife) countless times, and always find them fascinating. He walks and talks exactly as AL did (according to the book) so this movie is not just a great achievement in cinematography but a brilliant depiction of actual events and an amazing achievement in acting.The only downside is you have to know a little bit of history as you will be thrown into the action, and might find it confusing. If you are into books I really recommend to read the original book first, and then enjoy watching this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Noble Effort, Masterful Performance, but Flawed History","Portraying historical figures on film is a challenge. Such is particularly the case for beloved American icons with well-established identities.The filmmaker's challenge rests not so much in recreating history. Typically, plenty of credible narratives exist which provide multiple accounts of the icon's role in history. What's toughest is striking the right balance between realism and art, melding history with entertainment, and doing what would seem impossible -- satisfying academics, film critics, and the ticket-buying, movie-going public. This is where Lincoln ultimately soars on at least one account, but fails in others.One has to admire the filmmakers -- including Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner -- for not sentimentalizing the material. The creators appear to understand the gravity of the subject matter here, that what's portrayed on film and seen by millions over the next decades essentially becomes THE interpretation of history.Which brings is to Lincoln -- the man, the President and the actor who portrays him, notably Daniel Day-Lewis.  This is an extraordinary performance by perhaps the best film actor working today. I've long marveled at Day-Lewis' broad range of characters, from the villain in ""Gangs of New York"" to an equally mesmerizing figure in ""There Will be Blood."" To think Day-Lewis, who holds duel Irish and English citizenship, could manage to pull off absolute perfection in the role of perhaps America's most revered historical figure is an astonishing testament to the craft of film acting.Every grueling detail of Lincoln's mannerisms -- his voice, his tone, his walk, and the disposition of his very presence -- are as exactly as one would hope and expect, which is not to say that any of this is predictable. After all, how exactly does one pull off the voice of a man who's voice was never recorded? How does an actor combine the expressionism of a largely self-educated Kentucky-born plainsman who becomes President, making him sound hokey but also wise? Day-Lewis' role will be favorably compared to Helen Mirren (""The Queen""), Meryl Streep (""The Iron Lady""), and Colin Firth (""The King's Speech""). But I think this was better, or at least more worthy of praise since a new benchmark has been hit here with the portrayal of iconic historical figures.Still, Day-Lewis' marvelous performance isn't quite enough to make what is a good movie into a film classic. Some of the supporting roles, widely praised by most critics, aren't nearly as convincing in my judgment. James Spader is perfectly cast as the unscrupulous lobbyist. But I still couldn't forget for an instant that I was watching James Spader portray some guy that lived 150 years ago. I was reminded of Jude Law playing Watson in the ""Sherlock Holmes'"" series. Then, there's Tommy Lee Jones, who somehow managed to keep his West Texas accent in this mid-19th Century period piece, despite the fact the Senator he's portraying is from Pennsylvania. I enjoy Jones' work and his character, Thaddeus Stevens is actually more admirable in many ways than the title character Lincoln himself. But Jones, displaying the same heavy-handed bombast in every character he's played since ""The Fugitive,"" struck me as another out of tune chord in the Lincoln piano. Then, there's poor Sally Field, regretfully cast in the critical role of Mary Todd Lincoln. Aside from the fact she's at least twenty years older than the real Mrs. Lincoln, her character is an affront to actual history. For instance, there's no record or way Mrs. Lincoln attended the debates in the House of Representatives. But Sally Field gets her ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" dramatic moments, lending spousal encouragement from the front row balcony.A few final thoughts: Those who go and see ""Lincoln"" (and I should note that this film should be seen) will probably be surprised as I was at how casual political Washington was in those times. Lincoln has virtually no personal security. The inside of the White House looks as cluttered with dust and worthless junk as my first D.C. apartment off of 17th Street. The imagery makes for one of the film's most interesting viewing pleasures -- seeing what day to day life was like in the chambers of power during the most critical phase of this nation's history.Speaking of that history, Lincoln's final grade as a film will be reduced for what I consider a travesty. The blame rests alone with producer and director Spielberg. In one of the final scenes, when the climactic roll call vote is played out in Congress, each and every member of the House of Representatives must take a stand. Each man is required to take a position on the right or wrong side of history. Yet many of the names you will hear in the film have been changed.That's right.In the film's pre-release publicity tour, Spielberg explained his decision. He acknowledged that he changed the actual names of many Congressmen who voted against the 13th Amendment. His justification for doing this was (he said) not to embarrass the living descendants of these men.Such gross misrepresentation of fact needs no counterargument. Those who were dead wrong, and who made the painful struggle for racial equality for all citizens more difficult should be exposed and known to all -- especially in a work which is presumably to be the most widely-seen recreation of this period of our history. It's mind-boggling that many of these names you will not hear in this movie, men who basically went on record against equality, have their names emblazoned on street signs and public buildings all over the country. Make no mistake. These are despicable people who abdicated all human decency when it mattered most.I'd like to know those names. History and justice demands it. But instead, Spielberg chooses to whitewash it. And that's not just wrong. It's practically a historical cover up. One should hope and demand better from Spielberg.Extended Review at: www.nolandalla.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Full House,"At a noon screening I sat in a full house of mainly seniors but also some young folks who appreciated the mood and gravity of the narrative as it reflected our own time as it did that of the debate and passing of the 13th Amendment. To my pleasant surprise, the crowd laughed at the right times and remained silent at the right times. Complicated history laid bare as stark reality rarely elicits such insight from a mixed audience. I attributed their discernment, perhaps too generously, to the fact we have good schools and great teachers in our community. A snobbish but natural reaction.Daniel Day Lewis will almost surely receive an Oscar nomination for his thoughtful performance of Lincoln. Indeed all the main characters may be nominated in one form or another, as will the director and the production staff. This is not merely a good film but a great one.If I have one reservation, it is that the opening scene in which a group of soldiers ponderously recite parts of the Gettysburg Address seemed curiously staged, rather like having schoolboys stand at a PTA meeting to take turns mouthing patriotic slogans. A jarring departure, and too reminiscent of modern political correctness from an otherwise compelling drama.I hope the outtakes will someday be available.

"Well-acted, beautiful looking, self-enamoured film","Lincoln is a beautifully acted, beautiful looking film about one of the most remarkable men of American history. Steven Spielberg continues to remind us why he is likely the greatest director of all time. Lincoln is visually beautiful, with costumes, production design and cinematography off the chart. With very little imagination, we are put inside the 19th century.Daniel Day-Lewis turns in a typically stunning performance as he embodies the former President. Tommy Lee Jones is also sharp, witty and grouchy as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens. Hal Holbrook, Lee Pace and David Straitharn also turn in great supporting roles.However, not all the acting is able to hold up with Day-Lewis and co. At times the presence of high profile 21st century actors like James Spader and Joseph Gordon-Levitt can become distracting (even though their performances are fine), as there is not enough fake facial hair in the world to disguise them. Sally Field also hams it up and overacts as she tries to grasp at all possible screen time and remain relevant long past her prime.Where the film suffers is its screenplay. The film is clearly more enamoured with its own words than we are, and we are subjected to long, dull monologues that bore and tire us. Even during the film's most enjoyable moments (the Congressional debates) little effort is made to examine the Democratic opposition to the 13th Amendment, preferring to serve up racial diatribe in order to saintify Stevens and Lincoln and demonise the others. With respect to Tony Kushner, but perhaps if the screenplay had been written by a less poetic and more political-savvy writer (a Sorkin or a Willimon or even a Clooney), Lincoln could have been something engrossing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Why, in point of mere fact, I think so too."" -- Abraham Lincoln -From, Speech at Peoria, Illinois Oct. 1854 (Vol. II) ""I think your race suffers very greatly, many of them by living among us, while ours suffers from your presence.

A Masterpiece of Unparalleled Magnificence,"Our greatest President did not come from a wealthy home. He did not have an Ivy League education. Nor was he seen as experienced enough to take the office when he was elected amid one of the most politically volatile periods in United States history. But Abraham Lincoln was a leader of unparalleled strength, conviction, and honor, and Steven Spielberg's film brings to the screen the incredible story of how he united a fractured nation and ended the disease of slavery.""Lincoln"" begins at the start of the sixteenth President's second term. Newly re-elected, he has a unique opportunity to work within an also fresh House of Representatives and see an unprecedented Amendment added to the Constitution to abolish slavery in the country. Lincoln's goal is complicated by his personal life; namely his wife Sally's depression over the death of their first son, and the rising tide of Democratic congressman determined to retain law keeping slavery as is.No matter your politics, your race, or your background ""Lincoln"" is a film that unifies us. After a particularly dirty Presidential election this year, it was re-affirming to see how different Abraham Lincoln was than the men who have followed him. Lincoln was calm, soft-spoken and rarely raised his voice. He was every bit a political animal as the others who have lead the United States, but he did so through leadership. So sadly rare is that in any political office.Daniel Day Lewis deserves more than an Oscar for his performance. Lewis deserves to go down in history as one of the finest thespians ever to grace the script. Here he embodies a man that serves as a hero to us all yet remains a mystery, none of us know how Abraham Lincoln spoke, or walked. Yet Lewis is Lincoln. We never doubt for a moment that the man on the screen is anything but our finest President.As his First Lady, Sally Field is as spontaneous and energetic as ever, though keeps with the documented depression and sadness that overwhelmed their family after the death of a son. She more than holds her own on screen with Lewis. Tommy Lee Jones is Representative Thaddeus Stevens, a short-tempered, quick-witted abolitionist on the side of the President to end slavery. Jones hobbles with a cane but portrays Stevens in thunderously strong performance.Hal Holbrook, James Spader, David Strathairn, and countless others are the rest of Lincoln's cabinet, other congressmen, and party operatives. Each performance is perfect to a minute detail. But it is detail that separates Steven Spielberg's film from any other historical biography; ""Lincoln"" is as informative as it is entertaining. An enthralling script keeps the audience avidly interested as the set and person come to life.""Lincoln"" is an American masterpiece. No historical film before it has unified its audience while telling a story vital to the freedom the United States is honored to represent today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Why the Civil War?,"This is a very clever and well produced propaganda piece designed to convince the world that the American Civil War was all about freeing the slaves.But while that was an important and on the whole very noble issue (the film does show several less 'noble' aspects), the truth was far more nuanced, involving a power struggle between industry and agriculture and rivalries with European nations (the USA was busy denouncing colonialism while busy building an empire of its own), state vs federal rights and whole lot more.My fear with a film of this kind - which presents extremely well just one side of an argument - is that it will deter people from investigating the matter more deeply and arriving at a more balanced truth.But at least this film does very well what it sets out to do, as opposed to some recent fabrications that have sought to rewrite history and/or further modern political ends.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A modern masterpiece,"Making a film about Abraham Lincoln is no simple task for a variety of reasons. Lincoln, the man and the story, is such a complex layering of accounts and instances and points-of-view that to try to portray each and all of these in a film would be a fools errand. But if any filmmaker is capable of portraying several of these as well as possibly imaginable, it is Steven Spielberg, and if any actor is capable of bringing this role to life, it is Daniel Day-Lewis.That being said, it is worth noting that this film is probably the most acting and dialogue driven Spielberg has ever made. This film is a very surprising take on Lincoln, because of how Lincoln has been thought of in the past and because of how he is portrayed to us in history classes. Lincoln is traditionally thought of as a man who was eloquent and grand, most likely because of his appearance and his height. However, as indicated by historical accounts, Lincoln is portrayed in this film as a humble midwestern man who was plainspoken and sincere. He is shown to be a jokester and a storyteller. Day-Lewis does an excellent job of humanizing Lincoln and taking our perception of him from Lincoln, the president and historical figure, to Abe the man.Equally as impressive as Day-Lewis' performance was Tommy Lee Jones' portrayal of Thaddeus Stevens. Jones' task was, in a way, made even more difficult by the fact that he had to play an old, world weary man while the same could be said of Lincoln himself. He had to, in many ways, parallel Lincoln and be his incarnation in the House of Representatives while still being his own character, and I cannot say that he could have done a better job.We have been waiting a long time for Spielberg to do a serious historical film in the likes of Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. In a way, this is his grand return to that stage.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Exactly what I expected,"This is yet another film that I'd been putting off for ages, which I finally got round to watching. But whereas many films surprise you, Lincoln did not - it was exactly what I expected, a slow film about politics.The film was pretty good overall and gets 7 stars, with only 3 against, so let's take the short route and talk about the 3 negative stars.It was overly complex and not very exciting, but I accept my low interest in politics as a factor in that, but it still had an element of Spielberg spoon feeding which I couldn't tolerate. The educated black corporal, enunciating his point perfectly, questioning Lincoln's policies, followed by the two rather dense white boys, fumbling their words, just to emphasise that Negroes were indeed quite intelligent chappies and shouldn't have been slaves at all. We knew that already.There were no battles or real fighting in it. I remember when I was a young lad, excitedly watching a movie with bare breasts at the start, only to discover two hours later that these were the only bosoms throughout the entire film. A trick to haul audiences in by showing grimy fight scenes at the start, but nothing else thereafter. Lots of military costumes, stills, bands playing - no action.And most importantly, the film wasn't really about 'Lincoln' at all, was it? It should have been called the 'Thirteenth Amendment', a film about the abolishment of slavery. If it had been about Lincoln then I would have expected scenes about his childhood, growing up, how he got into politics, who he defeated to become president, kids, marriage, etc. but that's not what the film was about.A film about the abolishment of slavery and the signing of the 13th amendment, which was presided over by Lincoln, the president at the time. Lincoln was a good film, but it fell short for me. It was overly complex in some places and very restrictive in its approach in others.I mostly enjoyed it though and at least I can say I have seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Perfect Movie - will win everything,"I saw Lincoln last weekend with my husband and some friends and thought it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. I watched it again last night with our son and enjoyed it even more. I cannot think of a flaw to report with this film. The accolades that have been heaped upon Daniel Day-Lewis are 100% deserved. Tommy Lee Jones is superb, as well. They will win Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Sally Fields delivers an outstanding performance as the emotionally fragile Mary Lincoln. The remainder of the cast is equally amazing. Whoever did the casting was spot on with every character. The story itself, the passing of the 13th Amendment, is one few people have heard, that is the actual details of the process. My husband has read 1000's of pages about Abraham Lincoln and had never heard these specific details. I could go on raving about this film, but better for you to see it. It is extraordinary.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln works superbly,"At this point I suppose it is almost expected that Daniel Day-Lewis will give a great performance in all of his roles, but that doesn't make his performance in Lincoln any less phenomenal or memorable. The theme of the movie is an old and familiar one, but that doesn't mean the message is any less effective or relatable.The film is not a political thriller, more a political conversation between old men and we observe their conversations during a very important time in American history. It was the right decision to make the movie in this way. Considering that most of politics, even to this day, seems to be a bunch of old men, and now women, sitting around discussing issues. An audience can laugh during certain scenes at the backwards thinking of some people back then, considering how far we have come as a country since 1865, but we still get the sense of just how vital those conversations and debates are, that these characters were having. Since I am not the most political person in the world, some of the language that was used in the film I was not familiar with and some of the information may have been lost on me, but the overall risks these people were taking, and the reasons why they were taking them, were very apparent to me. And whether or not you let every single word sink in, you will be just as caught up in the argument.Daniel Day-Lewis is surrounded by other great performances, notably from Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Field, among many others. The film feels like it was built for actors. The movie does not rely on editing or fancy camera work to tell it's story, most of the time people are just sitting around a room in a dense layer of cigar smoke rambling and banging on their desks to illustrate their pointsnot much has changed, although we may have nicer desks now. I at times thought Lincoln felt a lot like a play, and maybe even would have been more effective if it was done as a play. But the film works and works superbly.Probably my only complaint would be that I had thought the film should have ended during a wonderful scene about five or ten minutes before the movie actually endedbut who am I to disagree with the brilliant Steven Spielberg? I do not at all mean this statement in a sarcastic manner, and this should be quite apparent to anyone who watched Lincoln.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Daniel Day-Lewis made a fine Abe in Steven Spielberg's Lincoln,"Just watched this with Mom and my movie theatre-working friend. We all were pretty enchanted by Daniel Day-Lewis' characterization of the 16th president of the United States. Seeing his struggles in getting the 13th Amendment-that's meant to abolish slavery-passed provided most of the drama though there was also some pertinent conflict between Abe and wife Mary (Sally Field) about the death of one son and the about-to-enlist-status of another son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). Then there's Tommy Lee Jones as anti-slavery congressman Thaddeus Stevens as he admirably takes charge of his scenes whenever he's on screen. Steven Spielberg really outdoes himself this time in depicting the administration's dilemma during a time of war and a divided country. So on that note, I highly recommend Lincoln.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
An Excellent Film,"Lincoln delivers. I could end my review right there, Lincoln delivers. So many things have already been written about this movie but I wanted to share some of my thoughts with the world.Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing, flawless in fact. I've never seen him in a movie that he wasn't flawless in. I'm not sure I can say it any more clearly than that. DDL has made a career of playing strong characters (There Will be Blood) that dominate the screen. But in Lincoln he ""cracks the throttle"" and plays Lincoln with superb subtlety. President Lincoln is already larger than life, so there's no reason to take the character too far. Instead Daniel Day-Lewis presents a very Presidential Lincoln who is in ultimate control, even if those around him don't know it. If we didn't know President Lincoln was a real person then you would think that this movie was about some kind of impossible superhuman, that's how good DDL is.The rest of the cast is solid, no complaints about Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, or Joesph Gordon Levitt. They all pale in comparison to Daniel Day-Lewis, but that's the point. Sally Field has the thankless role of playing Mary Todd Lincoln, a person that makes Sybil look like a well adjusted woman.Holding this movie back is it's length (2 1/2 hours) and its pacing. To say it straight: this movie is slow. If you're into history/politics/phenomenal acting then you should check this movie out ASAP. But if you're expecting this movie to be anything other than a slow burn you'll be disappointing. Again, if you like There Will be Blood, then you'll probably really like this movie.The only other thing I have complaints about were the ending and it's overly cheesy handling of Lincoln's death (seriously, IMDb better not claim that's a spoiler, I didn't check the spoiler box). I felt that it should have been done differently, we all know how it ends and it could have been done in a more powerful way.Those two ""complaints"" aside, go see this movie immediately if you've ever liked anything that Daniel Day-Lewis has done. Go see it even if you haven't because he does justice to President Lincoln that no one else could ever do.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln (2012),"Straying from the conventions of a true biopic, Lincoln, the newest film from director Steven Spielberg presents a detailed view into the divisive state of American politics during the waning days of the Civil War. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner depict the monumental challenge and vast political opposition President Lincoln faced while fighting for the passing of the 13th amendment into the Constitution. The film is sharp and focused, concentrating less on Lincoln's personal and family life, in order to fully portray his tenacity and drive to have the hotly contested amendment passed before the official conclusion of the war. While this approach largely benefits the film, there are instances in which Lincoln could have benefited from a closer examination in to the President's more meaningful personal relationships. In particular, the scenes between Lincoln and his oldest son (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) seem to lack a certain emotional punch and ultimately seem fruitless and ineffective.The always-stellar Daniel Day-Lewis brings a calm, subdued sensibility to the title role. Day- Lewis does well to depict Lincoln's humanity while maintaining his larger-than-life stature. He's seen in the film as a man of immense power and influence as well as immense charm and wit; always equipped with a joke or anecdote, but commanding and fiery when the situation demands it. As the film approaches its conclusion, Day-Lewis deftly paints the picture of an exhausted Lincoln feeling the full weight of the immense burden he is carrying. It's a brilliant, nuanced performance that further solidifies Day-Lewis as Hollywood's most gifted leading man.In addition to Day-Lewis in the lead role, Lincoln is overloaded with perfectly cast character actors that breathe considerable life in to Spielberg's Washington. Much of the films humor derives from the trio of James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson as slippery Washington lobbyists tasked with securing across-the-aisle votes in favor of the new amendment through various under the table dealings. Sally Field gives a solid turn as the volatile Mary Todd Lincoln. Anguished by the loss of one son to typhoid fever and the dread of losing another to the war, the film's First Lady is portrayed as someone forced to put on a deceitful smile for White House guests while suffering privately. Tommy Lee Jones shines as Republican Congressional leader and devout abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens, one of the many characters in the film faced with the alternative of betraying their own convictions in service of a greater good.Despite Spielberg's reputation as the master of on-screen spectacle, Lincoln confines itself to a platform more fit for a stage play than a motion picture epic. At times the film seems like nothing more than a collection of mostly static scenes depicting men sitting in rooms talking. Despite its few visual flourishes and a brief battle sequence that opens the film, Lincoln could certainly be considered the least purely cinematic picture in Spielberg's illustrious canon. Even with these hindrances, the powerhouse performance of Day-Lewis makes Lincoln a captivating experience, if not quite a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Lincoln is good, but something only History Teachers will want to watch more than once","I have written a few reviews on IMDb, and actually consider myself a movie snob. If the rating to any move is below a 7.0, then I will not go watch it at a the theater. So what I'm basically saying is that if I could go back, I would save the 2 1/2 hours I spent watching Lincoln in the theater because I'm giving it a 6.Let me get straight to the point, Daniel Day-Lewis was brilliant... uncanny resemblance to Lincoln. As far as all the other actors and the script to the movie itself, not so much. I wasn't expecting fireworks or anything exciting, because this movie is exactly what it is supposed to be, the biographical story of the 16th President and how he went about ending the Civil War and abolishing slavery with the 13th amendment, but I was hoping for much more from Spielberg and this cast.In fact, no one can possibly even write a review for this movie ""containing spoilers"" because there is really nothing to spoil.The scenes are long and talkative, and a few times I was tempting to get up and go to the restroom just so I could wake myself up, and there didn't really ever seem to be any type of climax.Just preparing you if you decide you want to watch the movie. I have no idea who these people are giving it a 10 out of 10, and saying they wanted to go back and watch it again, because honestly I have no need nor desire to sit through another 2 1/2 hours of anti-climatic long winded political talk, if I wanted to do that, I would just watch youtube videos of congress.6 out of 10, Day-Lewis was brilliant, good movie but something you won't want to watch twice unless you're a history teacher, and well worth the wait for it to come out on DVD.

Worth Seeing,"I saw a pre-showing of ""Lincoln"". The movie was good- a little slow moving and long. It will make the nomination list for Costumes, Make-up and Set Dresser (what was up with all those packages wrapped in brown paper and tied up with string?). Sally Fields was stellar, in portraying Mrs. Lincoln, as an emotionally devastated mother- and not a crazy lunatic that others have. I am concerned with the opening set-up that may whitewash the truth of the Civil War. (The war began because of taxes placed upon Southerners by Northerners- not because of slavery). However, Spielberg did well in delivering the emotional turmoil of a Nation torn and Lincoln's performance as a Chess Master to find a way to bring the country back together. It is a good movie- you should see it, just not after your Thanksgiving Dinner. :-)",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Another overrated U.S. story,"I watched Lincoln and Argo just to know what all the hype was about and both let me down.You cannot surprise us with these historical movies. We know what is going to happen. You should not create fake events around the vote to create tension. You're telling history there. Be aware of your responsibility.It's not a bad movie but I wouldn't watch it again. I'm really trying to understand what makes people praise this movie. My theory is that everybody is just so satisfied that slavery got abolished. Abe is a national hero - you gotta love everything about him. I'm really sick of these issue related praise and awards. Only because slavery got abolished in this movie, it doesn't mean, it's a masterpiece and the fact that he plays Abrahaman Lincoln doesn't mean DDL gave an amazing performance.Seriously, what is all the DDL hype about? NOBODY knows how Abraham Lincoln talked, walked, moved and laughed but everybody is so amazed by this pale performance. I'm not saying it was bad. It might be good if Lincoln really was a guy who was above it all and didn't really give a damn about all the concerns his team had. But if so, it is a freaking easy role play and that's all I got here. Not much acting involved, just a tall guy moving around slowly and talking without any temper. There were only 2 scenes where he actually had to show some emotions and one of them (He slapping his son) was just horrible wooden and disqualifies him for any award (especially when there is a Denzel Washington in Flight in consideration].P.S.

Awful,"I usually don't take the time to write a review however I felt it necessary in this case as I hope this helps someone save some time and money. I just got back from watching this movie and I had high hopes due to the 8.3 rating it was receiving on this website, however I was sorely disappointed to find that the movie was simply put an overall awful experience. I believe that the high rating is coming from the fact that people are essentially being guilted into saying they liked the movie since it is about a sensitive issue.This movie simply put should not have been made, there just isn't enough content in the story to justify making a movie out of it, every scene seemed to be just a bunch of old codgers discussing the impact of the 13th amendment. I could just as easily read this story in 5 pages in just about any American history book and saved myself the pain of watching the strained acting performances from just about everyone in this picture (except DDL who was the bright spot portraying Lincoln).I hope this is helpful and saves you some time and money",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A movie for the ages,"Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is not a traditional biopic. It takes the view that a man's life is measured by his deeds. So, rather than trace the 16th President's whole life story, the film gives us a portrait of Abraham Lincoln by focusing mainly on the few weeks in early 1865 when he achieved his signature deeds: ending slavery and preserving the union. In seeing how he led the nation at that pivotal moment, we learn all we need to know about who he was and how he lived.Daniel Day-Lewis brings Lincoln to life in a way that is both unexpected and likely to forever change our concept of the man. Our image of Lincoln has been so shaped by statues and still photos; it is hard to remember he was a living, breathing person. Day-Lewis' mesmerizing performance shows us a Lincoln who is engaging, charismatic, funny and sometimes fiery. This is the Lincoln who could captivate crowds with his oratory, who could inspire others to follow him.Lincoln is not a movie where the drama is played out against a backdrop of politics. In this movie, politics is the drama. This is a movie about process. It lays bare the often-ugly route leaders had to take to accomplish change in the 19th century (a route that doesn't seem much different than the ones today). It's a movie that's about principle versus compromise, and the balance that needs to be struck to get things done. In one scene, Lincoln makes a poignant analogy while speaking with abolitionist Representative Thaddeus Stevens (played brilliantly by Tommy Lee Jones – who nearly steels the movie). Lincoln reminds Stevens that a compass can tell you which way is North, but it can't tell you where the swamps are along the way. It would probably do every politician a lot of good to watch that scene.To tell this story, Spielberg has assembled one of the most impressive casts in movie history. From the wonderful Sally Field, to the aforementioned Mr. Jones; from the always-incredible David Straitharn to the great Hal Holbrook; from the hilarious James Spader to the terrific Michael Stuhlbarg – from top to bottom, nearly every speaking role is filled by one of our finest actors.This is a movie that is simply saturated in greatness. We have our greatest living director (Spielberg), working from a script by one of America's greatest playwrights (Tony Kushner), based in part on a book by one of our greatest historians (Doris Kearns Goodwin), starring arguably the western world's greatest actor (Day-Lewis) – all to tell the story of our greatest president.

This movie keeps you interested threw most of the movie without even trying, you can just listen to these great actors talk and be completely content.

Shall We Stop This Bleeding?,"After nearly two decades in production limbo, the story of Abraham Lincoln arrives on the big screen courtesy of Steven Spielberg. Lincoln— which could more appropriately be titled The 13th Amendment—shows the trials surmounted by our sixteenth president in ratifying the Constitution in order to abolish slavery. Though the film's focus is chiefly on this particular amendment's passage, the scope of the film is nothing short of magnificent.Daniel Day-Lewis personifies Lincoln, characterizing him as an imposing figure in stature, but a jovial, soft-spoken leader of an adoring public. Day-Lewis has garnered recent prestige for his grand, ominous roles as Bill the Butcher in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York, and Daniel Plainview in Paul Thomas Anderson's There Will Be Blood (Best Actor Nomination, and Win respectively). However, as the titular character in Lincoln, Day-Lewis's methods are subtle and reserved. He does not impose himself upon each scene, but rather observes silently: speaking only when articulation is necessary or a humorous anecdote will rouse his compatriots. Though he expresses less grandeur in this portrayal than previous outings, Day-Lewis is as brilliant playing Abraham Lincoln as ever.Day-Lewis isn't the only one whose acting abilities should be commemorated though. Lincoln is brimming with astonishing character actors. Tommy Lee Jones embodies Thaddeus Stevens, a stringent abolitionist, and vicious tongued debater. Jones is sure to reap numerous award nominations for his fierce portrayal of the reluctant Stevens. James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Hawkes play a trio of seedy contractors charged with persuading several Democrats to adopt Mr. Lincoln's cause. The scenes containing this trio are thick with humor, and contain some of the best dialogue in the film. If nothing else comes of this terrific film besides Spader increasing his presence in cinema, it will not be a waste. David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, and Jackie Earl Haley showcase their impressive talents in this film. Lee Pace (Pushing Daisies) is superbly wretched as Fernando Wood, one of the main opponents to the anti-slavery legislation. Another actor certain to receive some acclaim for her depiction is Sally Field. Field plays Mary Todd Lincoln, the depressed, yet supportive, wife of Lincoln. She shares a few overwrought scenes with Day-Lewis that remind the audience that Abraham is not the only Lincoln being studied here. A particular scene shows her matching barbs with Jones, and winning out against his imposing character. Lincoln is filled with actors whose names may slip your mind presently, but you are sure to recognize in future films.Spielberg creates an intriguing political drama with Lincoln. He paints a delicate portrait of Abraham Lincoln, but also manages to infuse the film with a pounding political momentum. The script for Lincoln was crafted by Tony Kushner (Angels in America, Munich). Kushner and Spielberg create Congressional hearings that are fascinating to behold. Some of the greatest scenes in this film are void of Lincoln, and concern the fiery debates between members of the House of Representatives. It's as if someone has switched to an exciting presentation of C-SPAN, or an actual meeting of the Houses of Parliament.Lincoln does have a few brief lifeless moments: the beginning is ridiculously heavy-handed, and the closing segments feel entirely unnecessary. Seated near me during the showing was a young boy; when the credits close after Lincoln has been declared dead, he declared: ""I knew he was going to get shot in the head."" I couldn't help but chuckle. He highlighted an interesting point though: It feels excessive to include Lincoln's demise. We are all aware of his death, and it isn't handled in an interesting way, but rather shoehorned in at the close. It's almost as though Spielberg, or a studio executive, figured audiences wouldn't know about one of the most infamous assassinations in history. Although for a brief few minutes in the beginning of this film, as well as the close, there is a dry spell; the majority of Lincoln thrives.http://flickermotion.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Deserving and infuriating at the same time.,"Director Stephen Spielberg is now in the phase of his career where he chooses personal projects that he believes are important. Notable, worthy stories just waiting to be told to a wider audience.Lincoln, perhaps the most celebrated of American Presidents, presiding over the end of the devastating American Civil war, together with the emancipation of those in slavery within the US, clearly falls into this category.To cover Lincoln's early life and achievements might take several films, so Spielberg and writer Tony Kushner have decided, rightly or wrongly, to ignore Lincoln's early life. The screenplay focuses on the end of the war and more specifically, the in-depth political machinations necessary, to allow slavery to be abolished, before becoming a bargaining chip upon the surrender of the Confederate army.As we join the story, despite earlier setbacks, the war is going ""well"" under Ulysses S. Grant. Wholesale, futile slaughter is continuing to occur but the war of attrition favours the ""Union"" and all indications are that the war is won.Lincoln foresees his dream of passing the 13th amendment to allow slaves the right to be free, will never pass Congress, once the South rejoins the Union. Effectively an agonizing choice, if the war ends too quickly, the opportunity the pass the amendment disappears. Delaying the end of the war consigns countless thousands to an early grave or the possibility of mutilation on the battlefield.To put the conflagration into context, historians estimate as many as 750,000 or more soldiers were killed during the war. More than the combined total of American casualties in all wars fought subsequently. Some 50,000 casualties at Gettysburg over three days alone.The screenplay, based on the book ""Team of Rivals"" attempts to portray the necessary horse trading, cajoling, threats and favour induced vote ""buying"", required to secure support to allow the amendment to pass. The story in many ways remains relevant with the state of modern politics, with fixed position stalemates and general intransigence very much the order of the day.Without the right actor anchoring the story, the whole enterprise could resemble a high school play gone badly wrong, with a tall actor, dodgy beard and Stovepipe hat incongruously perched on his head. Fortunately the director persuaded the only actor that could inhabit the character believably to take on the role.Daniel Day Lewis ""is"" Lincoln, at least we think he is. Despite photographs, there are no recordings of his voice and therefore Lewis creates a reedy, ""olde Worlde"" timbre to his voice, mannerisms and posture.It is likely another best actor Oscar statue will be added to the Lewis mantelpiece, from an acting point of view, he is exemplary. Lewis is totally believable and receives sterling support from a large list of supporting actors, notably Sally Field as his rather fragile wife, Jospeh Gordon Lovitt as one of his sons, Tommy Lee Jones (Thaddeus Stevens), David Strathairn (William Seward) and James Spader (WN Bilbo).The period detail is excellent, production values are what you expect of a Spielberg production, directorial flourishes are almost non existent and the John Williams score is subdued but effective. After the directors recent rose tinted and sentimental ""War Horse"", it is good to see a realistic and mature approach to the horrors depicted. Battle scenes are very limited but the tone is dark and ominous, bad things are clearly occurring and Lincoln knows he possesses the power to stop them, if he so chooses.It is historical fact that Lincoln loved recounting stories to illustrate his point and Lewis delivers these beautifully, despite his cabinets evident exasperation. Lincoln himself received very little formal education and came from humble beginnings, acquiring knowledge through voracious reading.So an important story, with fine acting, costumes, sets and production values, surely a crowd pleaser? Unfortunately, for the average International cinema goer without a deep interest in the minutiae of American politics and Machiavellian art of acquiring political votes, this is dull, dusty and rather boring watch. Worthy of course and certainly staple viewing for US high school students and without question, the best and likely the last film on the subject.Oscar voters will of course bestow the film with many awards and box office suggests, as expected, that the film will perform much better at home than abroad.SummaryA historical drama, deserving of five stars in many ways but only two from an audience experience, therefore settling on the above result, which is both deserving and infuriating at the same time.Despite being worthy, this makes for a difficult and rather tedious watch, almost as if the director has forgotten why people go to the cinema in the first place.

Historically accurate!!,"Lincoln was a very commendable movie. It was very historically accurate which was perhaps the best thing about the film. It is quite a long film but is able to hold your attention for the vast majority of the film. It has it slow parts as all movies do, but they rapidly pick up and regrab the viewer's attention. Daniel Day-Lewis does a phenomenal job playing Lincoln. He makes the character relatable and very likable. I know myself, I fell for Lincoln's open and humorous behavior throughout the film. He did a very good job with the role he played. Sally Field also showed a very commendable performance, she played Lincoln's witch of a wife very well. I also admired the director's casting. He made all the actors look almost identical to the real historical figures within the film. It was amazing! The actors did genuinely represented the characters well! Overall it was a very good film, a bit slow at times, but very good! I recommend the film to all the history and Civil War buffs out there!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Day-Lewis IS Abraham Lincoln,"Here's one to appease all the history buffs out there. Steven Spielberg's historical drama Lincoln. Here you've got a story about one of the greatest presidents in our history being played by one of the greatest actors in our current history. That actor of course is the magnificent Daniel Day-Lewis who gives an exceptionally spellbinding performance as the 16th president of the United States.Lincoln chronicles one of the most tumultuous parts of Abraham Lincoln's presidency. As the Civil War enters its fourth year, Lincoln and his cabinet are stuck at a crossroads in passing the 13th amendment, an amendment that will effectively abolish slavery and will level all male citizens of the United States equal under the law. The film details Honest Abe's struggle amid a cavalcade of other characters all played by stellar A-List actors and actresses.First and foremost, Lincoln is a good movie. It was made by history buffs for history buffs and the historical accuracy of the film has been widely praised. It certainly helps that Day-Lewis bares a frighteningly uncanny resemblance to Abe, and his performance more than sells the idea that we truly are watching Abe fight for equality.However, if you asked me if I loved Lincoln I would have to say no. I liked it. I enjoyed it. I don't regret watching it. I didn't fall in love with it though. There were a handful of scenes I really did get a rise from. Namely, the debate scenes within the House of Representatives are some of the most enthralling and entertaining. They depict a Congress full of loud mouthed drunkards who shout and curse over one another, completely going against all of the civility we assume Congress exhibits today. (Ha, I could barely type that with a straight face). It depicts an unabashed and unapologetic take on Congress, one that was probably very accurate to the time period. Spielberg's attention to detail in these scenes shines as well, equipping almost every desk in the House with an ash tray and a bottle of liquor. It's these little things that make me smile while watching Lincoln.The rest of the film is full of powerfully performed scenes of Lincoln doing presidential, and non-presidential things, and plot forwarding scenes that are lit and shot consistently well by longtime Spielberg cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. These scenes, while setting an aesthetically gripping mood, also help cement the film's slow and sometimes dull pacing. I don't want to say that Lincoln is a boring film, but it does drag and doesn't always hold my interest from a plot perspective, holding me back from a love of the film.At the end of the day Lincoln is a film that should not be missed if you love Spielberg, Daniel Day-Lewis, or just great performances in general, because the film is packed with them. It boasts a cast of A-Listers including Tommy Lee Jones as the sternly sarcastic Thaddeus Stevens, Sally Field in a powerhouse performance as Mary Todd Lincoln, Joseph Gordon-Levitt in a smaller role as Robert Lincoln, David Strathairn as William Seward, and the always lovable James Spader as W.N. Bilbo, a foul mouthed, cigar smoking, quick witted sonofabitch. You'll find a great performance in every single frame of this film, even if as a whole the film doesn't exactly change your life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Does it portray what actually happened when abolishing slavery?,"In my opinion, the movie ""Lincoln"" is mostly very accurate. Lincoln did, in fact, lead the fight to get the 38th Congress to pass the Thirteenth Amendment and abolish slavery. He used his political skills and his ""immense power"" (which, by the way, Lincoln DID say) to sway the votes of reluctant Democratic congressman towards acceptance of the Thirteenth Amendment.Lincoln and Congressman Thaddeus Stevens worked together, in spite of their differences, to pass the the Thirteenth Amendment through the 38th Congress. There was a lot of pressure put on Lincoln to delay the Thirteenth Amendment's passage until after the war had ended. But Lincoln was concerned that if he waited for the 39th Congress to pass the amendment after the war, his previously issued Emancipation Proclamation might be overturned by the courts—allowing slavery to continue. Consequently, Lincoln was insistent on using his influence as President of the United States to assure the Thirteenth Amendment's passage. Fortunately for the slaves, he succeeded before he was assassinated on April 14, 1865. Although it could have included more of the slaves effort to end slavery. For example, they kept trying to escape for freedom.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Dull, dull and thrice dull","Poor Daniel Day Lewis. Slave to a very dull script, one prayed for his emancipation. He richly deserves every award going for persevering and managing a magnificent delivery of one boring monologue after another. A stunning performance. This is surely the most interesting era in America's past and one should be inspired to find out more. Instead one can't help feeling that ignorance of America's short but glorious history is bliss on this occasion. I wanted to be enchanted by America's past but the only thing to marvel at in this movie is everyone's splendid teeth. It seems even impoverished 19th century slaves could access modern Hollywood dentistry. The only distraction from the turgid plot was the numerous cute views of iconic Washington buildings, with only the Lincoln memorial being conspicuous by its absence. Half way through it occurred to me that only a director of Spielberg's calibre could inject a bit of magic and rescue this movie. Perhaps he might get DDL to pull a rabbit out from under that stovepipe hat. Then I remembered it is actually a Spielberg movie and I felt somewhat cheated. The various political machinations of the ruling classes are very interesting and well portrayed but one gets the feeling the director overruled his natural instincts to wow an audience and was overburdened by the need to ensure the film carried enough gravitas. Pompous, boring, overblown, tedious and long winded, this film nearly had me petitioning for the restoration of John Wilkes Booth's reputation on the grounds of justifiable homicide. All in all I wish I'd watched Abraham Lincoln: Vampire hunter instead as I can't help thinking that the un-dead might have had more life in them.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Miss Ravenel's Conversion from Secession to Loyalty,"In the 1867 Civil War novel Miss Ravenel's Conversion from Secession to Loyalty, a Union captain is assigned at the end of the war, to complete the muster-out rolls cataloging his regiment dead and missing over four years of fighting; to get a sense of the insurmountable task ahead of him, these 'rolls' were indeed supplied after Appomattox by the War Department in the form of sheets that measured a yard square.In the book, the captain is chosen because he is the only one who has been there since the start and made it through, the only one who has the memory to write the chronicle, jot down the history. Meaning there is the killing and dying, but there is a relative truth to it, a struggle to remember the narrative, one which must have some invented sense in its mechanism.Spielberg has no notion of this, never had.It's all about what kind of world you think this is. From his perspective, it is all too clean, clearly-defined, closed instead of open-ended, you can see that in the story he chooses to tell of Lincoln, the people as he shines his light on them. Oh, I'm fine with the facts they put in, they could have put more, could have put less. They could have made a fuss for example of Copperhead activities of the previous summer, to make Democrats look worse. More astutely, they could have said that Lincoln's re-election was at all possible because of costly military victory. Anyway, they have very cleanly managed to convey a complex political situation, the issues at stake.But again it is a simple-minded effect.Again with the moral platitudes, again with the flaccid narrative and speechifying, with the good guys on one side, noble in the eye of history if not constitutional law, and bad on the other, malicious fools or at best doddering pawns. It reminds me of the few instances we saw Germans in his Warhorse, flatly inhuman, cruelly whipping horses. Again having the subject be safely self-evident, because what would be those who abolished slavery if not great heroes, villains those who opposed it?And you can see the same dull unambiguity in his visual iconography of Lincoln—Lincoln as mythic shadow, as weary traveler, Lincoln in the candleflame of legend, popular, pedantic perceptions of the man. How else would you do it?The one great scene for me is where the passing of the Amendment is given to us as Lincoln waiting in his office, startled by the sudden joyous ringing of bells—there it is, the gap away from ceremony and heated fact, the waiting as gears snap into place, the man alone wondering.It's just not for me, overall. Because in Spielberg's world it cannot be just an army camp the president is visiting, not just life with its clamor and filth, it has to be so that four soldiers, two of them black, recite to him his Gettysburg Address—no soul here, only the sentimental schooling.But this is why it troubles to speak of it, because as you watch it, the doubt and inner turmoil is there, the morally fickle North and hostility to negro equality is there, the bartering of half-truths for necessity is there, the radical galvanizing as a byproduct of bloody war.So I'd ask anyone who likes this to more carefully differentiate solid scholarship in Goodwin's book, the historic legend of the man, some narrative complexity in the script, versus insights in the film and cinematic dimension in the presentation of people whose life is not in any book. Historic persons or not, the life you have to imagine.The difference is between researched history, and bringing it alive as fiction, which is what all filmmakers do, and why Spielberg so often fails when he tries to portray life. You could get the hats and wardrobe historically right, the correct type of wood in the benches, the words and gaslight, but still make a cartoon.So this is why I blame Spielberg. Film is a matter of representation, of creating the illusion of a world that moves. So the facts are here, but making it alive is a matter of erudition on the part of the filmmaker, a feel for either people or cinematic devices.Spielberg has taken some narrative complexity, and as he shouts action and we should have the flow of what is real life to his characters, he can't help but reduce, some truthful moments in Lincoln reduced by juvenile moments elsewhere, the same juvenile handling of people I find in all his other films.So this is everything he would most like to be thought of as, versus who he can't help but be. It's a silly film.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln Review,"In general, I thought the movie was pretty decent. The actors made the scenes pretty realistic. The set crew made the movie feel real, as if you were actually there. I thought the movie was accurate with history and it did a good job displaying the troubles that Lincoln had to deal with, both internally and externally. I feel like the Congress scenes embodied these struggles perfectly. Before watching this,I didn't realize how much public opinion differed in the north, I previously assumed that most everyone in the North agreed on how slavery should be handled.I also now have the respect for Lincoln not only as a political figure but also as a person since the movie did a good job of showing him on a personal level. On the other hand, at some times the movie was hard to follow and it took awhile in the beginning to get going. But overall, I thought the movie was good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Perhaps The Fastest 149 Minute Movie Ever Made,"As of the 19th of November 2012, 76 reviews have been posted for the movie Lincoln on IMDb. If I may,allow me to leave the reader with twelve fresh points about this wonderful movie.(1) Not once did I ever look at my watch. The movie could have played for another 449 minutes and I would have been thoroughly entertained. (2) Daniel Day Lewis was never one of my personal favorite actors. He is now. (3) I never left my seat at the conclusion of the movie. I stayed put and saw it twice. Both times the movie brought tears to my eyes. I was not alone. (4) I saw this film in a stadium style theater. God bless the senior citizens who climbed a lot of steps to see this movie. (5) Both showings I attended were in front of a packed house. The house applauded following both viewings. (6) Spielberg added a dramatic piece of scene setting background music to Lincoln that was also used to great effect in ""Saving Private Ryan"". (7) I agree with a local review published in Baltimore. The reviewer said that as Lincoln walks, his lumbering steps remind you of how the back half a costumed horse prances on the stage. Actually, I prefer Lincoln's horse to the 2011 War Horse by leaps and bounds. (8) Kevin Kline, in an uncredited role, portrays an wounded soldier. I'm not sure, but I think I was able to pick him out, but I wouldn't bet on it. That makes quite a statement when an actor of Kevin Kline's reputation takes a roll as an extra. (9) How many Academy Awards will this movie win? I would not by surprised if lead male, female, and supporting male and female awards go to this cast. (10) Speaking of supporting actor, how in the world do you pick between Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, and James Spader? (11) God bless Doris Kearns Goodwin for the time she spends building the characters of ""Team of Rivals"". The characters popped to life in Kushner's screenplay. (12) I wish Abraham Lincoln could have seen the diverse audience, young and old, all colors, who reveled with this movie. Everyone left a better person for seeing this motion picture masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The History Channel Presents,"A lot can be said for Daniel Day-Lewis's performance as Abraham Lincoln - it's amazing indeed. We all knew it would be the second the casting was announced. Day-Lewis breathes life into one of American history's most mythological figures, making him charismatic, larger than life, but sweet and spiteful and just human too. He's not alone - the supporting cast (special mention to Tommy Lee Jones) all do a commendable job, slipping comfortably into their characters, and delivering their dusty lines in a way that feels natural and fresh, as if you've stepped back straight into Lincoln's time.And yet - unfortunately - the wonderful acting is the only thing that makes Lincoln anything more than a History Channel docu-drama, albeit a very well-budgeted one. Beneath the superb actors; the flawless set and costume designs; the high-contrast, full of pathos cinematography that places Lincoln with a convenient halo behind his head every time; there's a very dull story treatment that moves at a steady and monotonic pace, with no ups and downs, no tension and no climaxes. It deals with the loaded and painful subject of slavery, yet somehow manages to completely avoid any sort of emotion. The viewer doesn't care about slavery, or about the 13th amendment - we care because we know Lincoln was a good guy and we want him to win. Slavery isn't given a face, slaves aren't given a face, and even when the amendment does pass we feel nothing. This is jarring when coming from Steven Spielberg, the master of emotional manipulation, who pulled at every heart string with last year's schmaltzy 'War Horse'.Lincoln is informative. Enough so that, if you're at all interested in the time period, the 2.5 hour runtime will go by reasonably quickly and the film will remain interesting throughout. It's also, admittedly, Spielberg's best film in years - since Catch Me If You Can, if not since Schindler's List. But one of the best films of the year? Hardly. At the end of the day, it feels like a very well-made historical reconstruction, and not a drama film. The points where it might have striven for some emotional connection - Lincoln's scenes with his wife Mary Todd (Sally Field) and son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and of course the assassination itself - are handled very poorly and feel like a lame attempt to squeeze some feeling out of the audience; again, a shocker when coming from a master like Spielberg. A film that could have been so much better than it is, but will still be shown to school children for years to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A movie that shouldn't be missed!,"Lincoln begins rather abruptly, with an absolutely gruesome battle scene that makes you feel you are truly witnessing it, hundreds of men in hand-to-hand combat with knives, bayonets, and swords in a muddy field. Fade to black. Then we see Lincoln sitting in a roughly built battlefield pavilion where he discusses the war and life in general with 2 black soldiers, followed by two white soldiers. Many do not like that part of it, but it didn't bother me. (It's always been the personal side of historical events and people that interests me, not battle strategy or what size of corn cob was used for cleanliness in encampment latrines.)Spielberg decided to narrowly focus on the final four months of Lincoln's life and his desperate push to get the 13th Amendment through the House BEFORE the end of the war. That narrow focus is the cause of some of the controversy surrounding this movie. However it is a very pivotal part of American history and I believe it deserves that narrow focus.Daniel Day-Lewis is stellar as Lincoln, but many think Tommy Lee Jones as the thunderous abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens steals the movie. Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln is also very Oscar-worthy. If Lincoln doesn't garner several Oscars, it will be a travesty.And that's my opinion and I'm sticking to it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Movie delivers too little in to much time,"2 hours and 35 minutes. That is how long this movie ran. People were snoozing and for good reason. Lincoln delivers the same content over and over again in a long amount of time. This movie could have been accomplished over a shorter time and not have lost anything. The content was there but the time spent on it just dragged on for too long.Daniel Day Lewis took on the main role as the great president and his struggles to pass the 13th amendment to abolish slavery. His performance was gripping and believable. However, the writers did not write about Lincoln but only his attempts to pass the 13th amendment. Very little background information was given and if you fell asleep during history class then you would not get any part of this. Director Steven Spielberg trusted the audience knew what was going on.When it comes down to the nitty gritty this movie was about Lincoln trying his very very hardest to abolish slavery and THEN stop the civil war. However, this was seen around a hour and a half in. The rest was just backup for the inevitable ending.Despite the predictability, length, and slowly gradual build up it did turn out to leave me with a good feeling in the end. Tommy Lee Jones performance in this movie was just a breathe of fresh air and gave Lincoln the character it needed.This movie is not for the type of person who often falls asleep but is for the type of movie goer who can respect a good story with decent content spread out over a long period of time.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Is Daniel Day Lewis channelling Buddy Ebsen?,"What's with the crazy old timer voice? If they do another remake of the Beverley Hillbillies, Daniel Day Lewis is a shoe-in for Jed Clampett. Yes siree.I have to confess, I haven't seen all of Lincoln. First time I fell asleep after about an hour, the second time I tried but just couldn't persevere with this boring hagiography. I've got better things to do with my life, like wash my hair. It was the scene where Lincoln chats to the troops that forced me to switch off. Spielberg never was an intellectual but, really, this is just jingoistic, dumbed-down historical camp for high school study groups.I don't expect complete historical veracity, but in this scene Lincoln chats to a couple of black troops, one of whom eloquently puts the case for racial equality, though given the way he spoke, he'd already received an education at Princeton. But then it gets truly nauseating, when another couple of troops come along and begin reciting the Gettysburg address word for word, because apparently everyone had heard it and knew it by heart back then. Of course, the black troop knows it as well, and recites it over his shoulder as he slowly heads back to battlefield, to finish off this drawnout, overwordy, cornball scene, which pretty much sums up the movie for me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A historical drama that drags on for too long,"""Lincoln"" tells the behind the scene stories of how Abraham Lincoln had to do to push the 13th Amendment through, in order to abolish slavery in America.""Lincoln"" has been nominated in many categories in the Oscars, but I have not been thoroughly impressed by the film. The plot is about how Lincoln lobbied to get enough support to abolish slavery, and this means a lot of talking. The film shows one meeting after another, and there is non stop taking about boring stuff scene after scene. How they can make such an emotional topic of slavery so boring is beyond me. There is not even an action scene to balance the predilection for sedentary activities. There is one scene where Sally Field shines with her emotional outburst, but this one scene is not enough to carry the whole film. I was bored with ""Lincoln"", because it is far too long and lack emotional poignant scenes. Even the supposed emotional climax falls quite flat, as the voting scene is simply chaos. The ending scene where we suddenly see why the guy took the original amendment away is not as effective as it could be, because there was no buildup to it.

You need a lot of patience with this movie,"They didn't have electric lighting in the 1860s, and there are quite a few scenes in ""Lincoln"" where you become well aware of the fact. There's no question that the movie strives to be faithful to the time and the specific historical events. Lincoln's voice is portrayed as somewhat high-pitched because by all accounts that is what it was like. His tendency to drift off into goofy or even scatological stories that may or may not be amusing to all around him seems also to be quite accurate. And of course the screenplay, based on a distinguished recent work of history, goes into great detail about the manipulations and machinations involved in the politicking over the proposed 13th Amendment.The familiar saying about laws and sausages--that it's better if you don't see either as they are being made--applies here. The politicking and scheming and patronage payoffs are tiresome. Let's face it, that's what legislation is still like today. The movie has nothing new to say about such matters except--and it's a big exception--the one most involved in this sausage making is Lincoln himself. He certainly doesn't look like a John Ford folk hero here, nor a Raymond Massey demigod.And that's perhaps the main theme of ""Lincoln""--that Lincoln was heroic precisely because in part he was a down and dirty man just like the rest of us. You need patience to see that out of this lowdown mess emerges a constitutional amendment that remains a guarantor of human freedom. Little by little you see the grandeur of Lincoln's vision--combined with a sly and cunning sense of how to make that vision reality, a lawyer's understanding that the Emancipation Proclamation would never be enough, and a political realist's understanding of the importance of timing. The man who tells goofy stories and is afraid to anger his wife turns out to be a genius and a true hero, a national treasure.That said, the movie does try one's patience. There's a lot of speechifying, a lot of dim rooms, too little open space. It's a literally dark, claustrophobic picture.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Gee maybe the Civil War was about slavery - just a little?,"I have to admit this review is not so much of the movie but of the reviews. I am getting sick of these history revisionists who scoff at the traditional image of Lincoln and seek to replace it with an image of some conniving, profiteering politician. To hear the modern 'historians' tell it, the Civil War was totally unrelated to slavery; it was all about States rights and secession or maybe just power and greed. But that's like saying that ""My car doesn't turn because I turn the steering wheel; it turns because the wheel turns."" How do you separate the slavery issue from secession in 1860? Read the diaries of the day - they understood it to be about slavery even before the emancipation proclamation. ""History"" can be made to say what you want it to and there is a temptation for those writing new books to come up with ""new theories"" just to sell them. I think in the 150 years since the Civil War, the losers have re-written the history. I don't say that this is 100% the greatest movie ever made on the subject but I do applaud Spielberg pointing out that yes, Lincoln did effectively end slavery in this country - period.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Lincoln - The Subtle, Mature Spielberg","Check out my full review here: http://ericsgoodstuff.blogspot.com/2013/03/film-lincoln.htmlI finally took the opportunity to see Steven Spielberg's epic historical drama Lincoln. And I'm so glad I did. It's a film deserving of the many accolades it's received. It gracefully guides us through President Abraham Lincoln's most far-reaching political victory: the passing of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America. Equally remarkable, it connects us to the giant historical figure of Lincoln on a personal level. This movie is the realization of an effort by a truly great team of filmmakers, led by Spielberg, but brought to cohesive fruition by a team of producers, writers, cast, and crew that are as dedicated to telling a meaningful story as they are to making it universal. Its a masterclass of film for the industry and a lesson in subtle, dexterous storytelling for the rest of us. Plus it makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.To be more specific on how the story is framed, the film deals primarily with the struggle to rally enough supporters to gain a 2/3 majority vote for the bill proposing the amendment in the US House of Representatives. While the Senate had more easily passed the bill earlier, and afterward it would be ratified among the states, the film takes the stance that the battle in the House was the lynchpin to the process - not only because of the close voting numbers in that governing body, but because of how its passing fit within the political context of the war and the popular opinion across the county. That I can explain this to you is a testament to the clarity with which the story is told - and political dramas can be tough to follow. To be fair, I've read Doris Kearns Goodwin's book Team of Rivals which was Spielberg's main source material for the film. But while true political dramas are more about delivering intrigue, the real summation of the story is an emotional catharsis realized when a set of circumstances and people find success in bringing to pass an historically groundbreaking and life-affirming event.Spielberg opens with a war scene, set in a muddy riverbed, of hand-to- hand combat from a time before modern military training and Hollywood action, where men clumsily, intimately face the reality of giving and receiving death. Awkward hands push faces, men wrestle and reel in the water, bayonets hit and miss their marks. It's a chilling context, necessary to remind us from the start that the ensuing story takes place in a land where Americans have engaged in and felt the effects of such combat for four long years. Politicians and citizens alike are anxious for this unnatural predicament - brother fighting brother - to come to an end. This is just the first of many evidences that this is Spielberg at his best. His quest for historical accuracy is another. Lincoln's study was carefully constructed to match the original down to the wallpaper. The ticking from Lincoln's actual watch was recorded. Spielberg is noted for having now famously come to set in a suit and addressing the lead cast members as Mr. President and Mrs. Lincoln.Lincoln shows the career arc of a master craftsman for both Steven Spielberg and John Williams. Both gained meteoric success through their collaboration on Jaws (1974) and have been a famous working pair ever since. Their distinct style set the modern standard for high-quality, entertaining, thematic, blockbuster filmmaking and scoring. This film portrays the skill of aged and experienced craftsmen willing to risk taking their art to the next level. As a follower of both their bodies of work I feel Lincoln is a culmination of their skill, thoughtfully matured with a touch that is subtle, slight, refined, and exquisite in its deliberate application that is lastingly powerful. And yes, I did look up ""subtle"" on thesaurus.com. I've said it before and I'll probably repeat again that artists' best work comes later in their career when they remain dedicated and persistent in the pursuit of the art.Daniel Day Lewis is fully deserving of his recent Best Actor Oscar win for this performance (and he gave one of the most charming acceptance speeches for it). He captures Lincoln's spirit without basing his performance on our standard modern perception of the man (i.e. the voice, the walking gait). Historians will notice Sally Field is almost a full two decades beyond the age of her character but unless you are categorically unable to withstand such inaccuracies, you will be convinced by her portrayal of the tortured Mary Todd Lincoln. Even after reading all of Goodwin's book, it was only Sally Field's performance that opened me to empathize with her character.I should also mention screenwriter Tony Kushner. His script delivers truthful dialogue that adroitly walks the line of accessibility and accuracy while never making us think we are listening to historical dialogue. I'm excited to see what his next project will be. Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as well. His normal crotchety and closed-in attitude - occasionally a liability for him in that he seems to always play the same character - is an asset here as he plays radical abolitionist Thaddeus Stevens. In fact, it's his character that gives the summation of the film as he comments on the messy, imprecise, precarious process of getting a bill through the House. He calls it ""The greatest measure of the Nineteenth Century. Passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It is not really about Lincoln, but about the push for the 13th amendment. In this movie, Lincoln is more of a character in the story of this legislation. This is fine I guess, but not what I expected. I would have felt the same way if ""Jaws"" turned out to be an expose on shark cage construction.2. It is difficult to follow. There are so many characters (mostly congressman) that appear nameless. The dialog seems accurate for the period, but there is a lot of it. At times, it seems to erode into random conversations. I sensed some ad libbing.3. It is boring. Sure, Lewis looks a lot like Lincoln, and the set is nice, but there are long periods between any significant or powerful scenes.As with most Spielberg efforts, this is an impressive production. Just don't plan to go away knowing any more about ""Lincoln""",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"File 13,","I love the movies-- our American art form-- but I'm afraid the last 15 or so years have been dismal! I just saw Lincoln-- and what a bore! 2 1/2 hours of boring, inaccurate talk, talk, talk!! Anyone who tells you differently either is lying, politically correct, or worshiping at the pagan altar of Abe Lincoln ( who was really a tyrant and a war criminal who killed 600,000 people and fought a total war against noncombatants over economics and against the Jeffersonian principle of the right of sovereignty and self-determination--and not- not about slavery! Lincoln was a racist, and despite publicity to the contrary, never freed one slave!) And while I'm at it, Spielberg is a bad director-- manipulative and sentimental and Tony Kushner is a bad writer-- manipulative and political. In this movie the music is too subdued, the cinematography is too dark, the art direction is too drab and the acting is too mediocre. Even Daniel Day Lewis' extolled performance is merely just--OK-- and not the masterpiece we have been told to expect. And that's the truth. Can you handle the truth?If you want to see a good biopic watch Lawrence of Arabia. If you want to see good acting watch A Streetcar Named Desire. If you want to see good directing watch The Graduate. If you want to hear good dialog watch The Apartment. If you want to see a good Civil War picture watch Gone with the Wind. If you want an interesting plot watch Chinatown. If you want to know the truth about dishonest Abe read The Real Lincoln by Thomas Di Lorenzo.

A movie to show that the content of the movie is still more important than the action,"Daniel Day-Lewis stole the movie. It was personally the best acting I have ever seen. There was no action scenes in this movie which is unlikely for a movie made by Steven Spielberg, but this film proved that he is not only good with explosions. The costumes and props of Lincoln set the time periods and scenarios very well and makes the viewer fell the appropriate atmosphere and the cinematography also manipulated the emotion of the audience as well as the excellent background music by John Williams. Steven Spielberg chose to tell the story in the perfect way, through both the eyes of both political sides and the time period was very well researched especially the way that people at the time thought and that added to the emotion created through the acting. The movie went through smoothly and there were almost no parts that seemed too short or too long. The movie Lincoln although it may not be for those who are looking for an action movie but if they would really take the time and understanding to see a movie with good content and acting or is interested in a drama or a political movie then this is a good movie for you",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Pure Enjoyment in a Motion Picture,"from the other side of the aisle.............................This is a must see movie....even if you are not a history buff. The acting, costumes, cinematography are breathtaking.The movie starts off with Lincoln discussing with two white soldiers and two black soldiers as to why they were fighting in the war. It is 1865 and the Civil War is nearing its end. While there is the Emancipation Proclamation, U.S. President Abraham Lincoln begins in earnest to achieve passage of the landmark constitutional 13th Amendment which will forever ban slavery from the United States. The Amendment must be passed before the Confederate States of American sign a peace agreement and the South is back in their Congressional Seats. Needless to say, even without the southern states there are two sides to the issue. Thus begins the movie.As the movie starts off there is about 5-7 minutes of a Congressional Session which is difficult to understand and seems a bit boring. Not to worry, from then on you are riveted to the screen, the actors and everything else Spielberg is offering. You will laugh, a tear will come to your eye and you will be amazed at the oratory of our 16th President.You need not be a history buff to understand and appreciate the movie and the long tentacles of political maneuverings. In fact, it doesn't look a whole lot different than today's political arena.There are several major issues that are floating about and the course of those issues keeps the viewer glued to the screen.Sally Fields is the quiet sleeper in the film as she does an outstanding job of playing Mary Todd Lincoln. David Strathairn plays Secretary of State Seward and is a major contributor and thorn in Lincoln's side. Tommy Lee Jones is also ""Bravo"" as Thaddeus Stevens, an influential congressmen, This is the first movie I have walked out of knowing that I was going to buy the DVD when it came out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
details are important,"I loved the accuracy and attention to detail in the telling of this important part of our American history and of Lincoln's statesmanship.My dismay came only at the end, when they placed the passing of Lincoln with his body in a curled up fetal position.History has recorded, the footboard of the bed was removed so his body could be placed diagonally out of respect and comfort for him.Here is the website with the attending MD's description of this: http://gizmodo.com/5916285/lost-report-of-lincoln-assassination- physician-found-after-147-yearsThought you might like to know the stature of our Lincoln was belovedly treated by those who guarded his life to his last breath.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Great Performances and Costumes,"Lincoln (2012)*** (out of 4)Steven Spielberg's telling of the last four months in the life of Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) focuses on him trying to get the law passed to free the slaves. I will probably be in the minority on this one but while LINCOLN contains some brilliant acting, wonderful costume designs and there's no doubt that Spielberg nails the look of 1865, I still found this film to be somewhat of a disappointment. For starters, the film itself really isn't about Lincoln, although it certainly wants people to realize that he's just a good old boy who did great things. There's no question about that but we really don't get to learn too much about him because the main focus of the film is various people trying to free the slaves. That's the main focus of the film and I think at times this here really drags the film to a halt because of Spielberg's handling of it. There are many, many sequences that just drag on to the point where it really does seem like you're watching them in slow motion and it appears, to me anyways, that it's a director having issues with what to do with dialogue scenes. The majority of them really don't build anything except for some annoying cinematography that constantly has the camera swinging around. There are scenes with added bits of life and exciting, like the eventual vote, but these scenes are far between. Even scenes where we get to see Lincoln struggling with his troubled wife (Sally Field) are far more exciting. Still, the performances here are so great that it's impossible not to get something out of the film. Day-Lewis is almost ghostly in the way he can just float into this role and there is never a time where you feel like you're watching an actor. The actor makes you feel as if you're really watching the real Lincoln. Field is also good in her supporting bit as is Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader and we get exceptionally strong work from David Strathairn and Tommy Lee Jones. The look of LINCOLN is also incredible and especially the terrific costume design and set design. Still, I was expecting a lot more from the film so while there's some great stuff, I still must say that I found it a bit disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Fantastic,"We are history buffs and Lincoln is part of the family. Daniel Day Lewis wasn't acting as Lincoln, he WAS Lincoln. I felt like I knew the man by the end and I liked him. There was a lot I'd heard but seeing it on the screen was like watching history. They absolutely could not have picked a better cast. James Spader was excellent, Tommy Lee Jones is Tommy Lee no matter what movie he is in and he always delivers, love that man. The casting person should get an Oscar for their part. It was interesting to envision the white house with gas lamps and fireplaces to keep warm, dirt streets, etc. I have had my children to the historic sites shown on the film and this made even more of an impression instead of just walking through historic sites. I wonder how the movie will do being released the same time as Twilight, but our theater was full and I hope all theaters do the same. Propaganda? Only if history is propaganda. They of course left out some of the reasons he did what he did, I'm sure so as not to anger some viewers, but overall a great adaptation of how Washington ran back then and all the work involved, with a lot of added laughs to boot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
spellbinding or boring...,"While watching Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" tonight, I tried not to get too bored and so from time to time I would pinch my arm, reminding myself that this is an important, historical epic. Fidgeting slightly, I thought to myself that what I really should have done was bone up on my history BEFORE going into the theater so that I could write a though provoking review afterwards. I mean, I don't mind films like this one as long as I can approach them from the proper frame of reference. And so let me just say this to anyone interested in going to see this film: It is deep and political. You have to actually listen to the dialogue and challenge yourself to think. Otherwise, there is no point in you being in the theater.But is it worth it? Taking on that challenge? Well, the film did not succeed in stirring up a lot of emotions and feelings inside of me. I wanted to feel proud or patriotic when I left the theater, but I didn't. Scenes showing crowds celebrating after the 13th amendment passed didn't bring on the goose bumps. So, in a nutshell, all of that effort I put into listening and understanding what was going on didn't really lead to any payoff. So here's the deal...""Lincoln"" is about a man, and as a story about a man it excelled on many levels. Daniel Day- lewis was exceptional in his portrayal of Lincoln with all of his shrewd political talent mixed with humble roots. He truly gave Lincoln heroic qualities and succeeded brilliantly in setting the man apart from his contemporaries. it was all there: the gentleness and kindly soft spoken manner. The humor and self depreciation. The oratorial skill, shrewd politicking and occasional fire and bombast. Simply put, Day-Lewis's Lincoln was every bit the brooding, humble, towering figure we all know and love from our history books. Well done, everyone.But unfortunately, ""Lincoln"" was not so much a biography as it was a film about the passage of the 13th amendment to the constitution abolishing slavery. Pretty dry stuff, in other words, which was unfortunate. I mean, as a story, there was not a lot there. OK, you need votes. You need to wheel and deal a little bit. And of course there are other players too - some of whom are on your team, and some of whom are not. So, but If you enjoy courtroom antics, politicspeak and legal debates, perhaps this might have kept you entertained throughout most of the movie. Unfortunately, I don't that much though. And the ending is a foregone conclusion despite attempts to hype it up. The amendment passes and everyone goes home, right? So now what we have is not a stirring biography about a man but a not-so-stirring story about an historically important political victory. IMHO, that was a shame. So with that in mind, how could the movie have been improved?Well, to tell you the truth, I really don't know. The problem is that treating the slavery issue sympathetically but without any pandering, condescension nor ""bleeding heart"" sentimentality is not easy. To Spielberg's credit, black's appearing in the film are given understated roles and treated with great dignity and respect. White senators on the other hand are often shown to be grimy, disreputable, tempestuous and rowdy. OK, I get the point. But still, something was missing here, and to me that was context, i.e. no one really showed us what a world with slavery was like and how it would be so much better without it. We do see scenes from the civil war, and the carnage there forms an important backdrop to what is going on in the White House. But that is somewhat divorced from the slavery issue itself. The reality went sort of like this: Slavery lead to the war which lead to the 13th amendment. But in the movie we just see the war and the 13th amendment. Tie ins to slavery are there, but they are somewhat of an abstraction. You don't FEEL the tie in in other words. I think that is my point. And without a tie in, I didn't get that feel good vibe when they counted the votes in the end. Could the movie have benefited from having a more prominent black character? Possibly, but it would have had to have been handled delicately to avoid the ""bleeding heart"" problem. I guess I don't know who would have been up to the challenge here. You would think though that Spielburg would have been if anyone was.But anyway, so Lincoln is a movie that is a bit hard for me to recommend and comprehend at this point. Maybe I need to sleep on it. As a portrait of a man and a time, it often succeeds very nicely, and you will smile at the humor, the sets and choreography, and the knowledge that a master of the cinema is behind it all. But the plot revolving around the 13th amendment was static, predictable, and devoid of any real tie in to the very issue it was attempting to address. Stepping back a bit and doing a better job of relating what was going on inside the offices with what was going on in the surrounding countryside would have given the plot more meaning. I mean, I'm all for senators negotiating, debating and trading barbs, but an entire movie devoted to that can get a bit tedious.EDIT: and one final point - these days any movie about a world not of our own (Sci-Fi, fantasy, historical, etc) ought to include at least some CGI, IMHO. Show us a CGI panorama of DC, in other words. We do see fragments of the city, but you don't really get a sense of place here. Just my opinion..",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln-A Different Viewpoint then we are used to,"LINCOLN - - To start with how could you not like a film that Hal Holbrook is in ? Directed by Steven Spielberg the film at 149 minutes is a little long it starts out on the slow side then picks up the pace into a crescendo. The two themes of the film is President Lincoln's attempts to one end the Civil War and second to get enough votes in The House of Representatives to pass by a two thirds majority the 13th Amendment to the US Constitution that will end slavery the Amendment that has already peen passed by the Senate. I enjoyed that portion of the storyline immensely being a political junkie to see all the behind the scene wrangling to get enough Democrats on board to assure it's passage knowing that the exact things still goes on today 147 years later. Much of the film takes place indoors with low lighting giving it the feel of what indoor lighting was like in 1865. Daniel Day- Lewis was brilliant as Abe Lincoln as was Sally Field as Mary Lincoln. The highlight performance to me was Tommy Lee Johns as Thaddeus Stevens who will do whatever is necessary to see that the Amendment passes, we find out later the ulterior motives for that Point of View. Toward film's end General Ulysses S. Grant tells President Lincoln something along the lines of ""Your appearance seems to have gained 10 years in the last 1 year"" I guess the strains of being President was as difficult today as it was then""",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln-Did not quite do it for me...,"I found this hard work at first in trying to understand what was going on, apparently this film is a bit like its namesake,""Stalls"" a bit here and there - however for any history Buff of American politics it would be of great interest. The use of the language of the time was a pleasure to hear, unfortunately it would be lost on most ears today I fear. Lincoln was a feast of quality acting but was done in a style that many might not enjoy. I expected a different kind movie in terms of the time span of his life and did find a few boring bits here and there having said that Daniel Day Lewis ""WAS"" Lincoln and all the other supporting actors did a great job.Gave this a 7/10 because I personally did not overly enjoy the film (too many closed room scenes), but anything less would be an insult to effort involved in making this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Dull, wooden and disappointing.","After all the hype, I had expected something pretty special, but was hugely disappointed.For me, any film about historical events needs to engage my interest either through bringing the characters to life in a sympathetic way, or by creating a web of suspense, despite my knowledge of the final outcome.Sadly, Lincoln does not come close on either of these points. I found the characters lacking in any human appeal - I really had no sense of caring about the fate of any of them, and got no real insight into their characters. The dialogue was extraordinarily dull, and the acting was, frankly, very ordinary. On many occasions I felt as if I was watching a stage play from the local rep, with the actors hamming it up as much as possible.It is as if there is a catalogue of events which needs to be included, and then a bit of dialogue has been added around that. At no stage did I feel any sense of excitement around how the (already known) outcome would be. I contrast that to a movie like ""All the President's Men"", which managed to develop fantastic suspense despite a well known result!To me the most shocking thing is the way in which a poor move has, with the inclusion of some big names, a big budget an massive hype, been passed off as a great one.

My Favorite Political Film This Side Of Mr. Smith Goes To Washington,"When the name Steven Spielberg is thrown around film conversations, it usually conjures up images of fantastic action/adventure/thrillers-Jaws, E. T., Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan, etc. But with 2012's Lincoln, Spielberg definitively proves-if he needed to after Schindler's List-that he can make a contemplative, deeply meaningful, dialogue-heavy movie with the best of them.For a very basic overview, Lincoln focuses on the titular U. S. President's (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) dogged persistence to pass the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery towards the end of the Civil War. Undeterred by a looming peace agreement (that begs to shadow human rights concerns) with the South and the usual squabbling between Democrats & Republicans on Capitol Hill, Lincoln uses his Executive Office influence and the power of compromise to get it across the finish line. Major players in the quest include wife Mary Todd (Sally Field), son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and other notable political figures of the times: William Seward (David Strathairn), Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook), Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), & W. N. Bilbo (James Spader).The most amazing trait of ""Lincoln"" might be its ability to mirror a contemporary political climate despite technically being set in a much more far-away one. The clothes and languages of the 1860s may be a bit fancier, but the Democrat vs. Republican back-and-forth is all too familiar. As always, though, the time-honored democratic tradition of ""compromise"" ends up being the fundamental narrative driven home by Spielberg here. No one faction gets exactly what they want and everyone has to compromise their big-picture principles a little bit, but in the end a very important piece of legislature is created. This is a fundamental truth of U. S. government, albeit one that is often forgotten-making this such powerful material.Of course, none of this would work nearly as well as it does without the performance of a lifetime from Day-Lewis. Every time he speaks-and he is given numerous show-carrying monologues-he instantly pulls the audience in with rapt attention, imbuing Lincoln the man with a sense of normalcy and real-world characteristics. Whether telling a folksy story or imparting some important wisdom, Day-Lewis is remarkable. Only helping matters is an auxiliary cast that is basically a Hollywood's who's-who's of stars. Every role-big or small-is executed by an industry vet or up-and-coming progeny.The one criticism of Lincoln I often hear is that it combines a 2:30 runtime with an approach that-barring one action sequence-is extremely dialogue-heavy. In other words, it would be easy for this film to be utterly boring if dropped into the wrong hands. Fortunately, the exact opposite transpires: with Spielberg at the helm, it is riveting from beginning to end. Lincoln builds upon itself-perfectly paced-resulting in the most breathtaking material commencing right where it should: the climax. The film's sneaky-good score from John Williams (who else?!) emphasizes the triumphant or subtle moments perfectly too. I've watched the film twice and could have spent even more time in this world and with these characters.Overall, I consider ""Lincoln"" to be a marvelous film-one of Spielberg's crowning achievements in a career that features so many of those. If Mr. Smith Goes To Washington is the political drama's aspirational classic, Lincoln is the genre's stunningly realistic (yet still entertaining) treatise. Please do not be put off by the film's dialogic nature or long runtime. It is riveting in ways that don't require swashbuckling action/adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Shakespearian Flavor & Well Done,"To me, this film has a Shakespearian feel in its delivery and presentation. There is lots of flowery language and it's rhetorically ornate. There's a fine line between being elaborate when being true to Lincoln's legend or being excessive by using his speech rhetoric and style to craft his every sentence in a long film. This movie is marked by intricate detail but it never feels excessive. So, it juggles everything perfectly in my opinion.The behind the scenes look at a complex issue and a complex man really works if you're in the mood for a film where you need to focus and pay attention all the way through. As everyone has noted, the performances from what is an all-star cast are all wonderful and compelling. A special shout out to James Spader who just shines in a small part.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Butt-kicking for goodness!,"Daniel Day-Lewis outperforms himself again this time as Lincoln. The film focuses heavily on Amendment 13 which gets rid of slavery but serves mainly as a device to end the war. There's endless political blabbering (well written mind you) concerning the passing of this amendment and the behind-the-scenes mechanics of it. You'll get some insight into Lincoln's personal life but unexpectedly he's portrayed as a man who kicks ass for goodness, a veritable saint. As much as I enjoyed this well made film I couldn't help but think that this was a product of the Americans obsession with their own culture and history, and for me as a European it just doesn't seem all that important.

A. Lincoln,"Of course if you did watch this in 2012 or 2013, there is the elephant in the room that we have to talk about. Actually it's more a vampire hunter than an elephant, but you get the point. There was this other ""biopic"" that wasn't actually accurate, though it did try to encapsulate Lincoln too. A more action orientated Lincoln that was. Daniel Day Lewis on the other hand, plays it very subtle. Actually he plays it so subtle, that Tommy Lee Jones is allowed to shine in a way, that you are not used seeing him.Of course Tommy Lee's ""character"" does have great lines, but also serves a purpose. And while this movie is not meant to be political, it does show (or should show), that republicans once had some sense in them. You wonder where it all went, when you watch abominations such as Fox ""News"". But that's a different story (though it obviously will lead to ""helpful/not helpful"" votes from some). Going back to the acting side, we also have Sally Fields in a very tough role. But she is more than convincing in that as well.Some write that Spielberg is maturing. He might be, but it's not like he wasn't able to direct before. It just might be, that his interests lie in different things now.

"Powerful Performances, Despite Poor Pacing,","Lincoln is a good movie with a well developed plot and a stellar cast. The performances are certainly what makes this worthwhile, Daniel Day-Lewis gives an empowering, theatrical performance that is spellbinding, truly living and breathing the dedication, perseverance of the great Abraham Lincoln.The pacing of the film was a problem, it is very one note, one level of energy, never rising or falling. There are far too many courtroom scenes, focusing far too frequently on Lincoln's struggles to abolish slavery, which I understand is the main story, but I would like to have gotten a better glimpse in to the man's personal life.The sets and designs are truly beautiful, Steven Spoelberg and his crew put in a lot of time to ensure it all genuinely looks like America in the 1800's, this was very effective in bringing the story to life. While it may be dull at times, Lincoln is saved by powerful acting and top notch directing, for Day-Lewis's Oscar winning performance alone, it is worth the watch.United States president Abraham Lincoln campaigns to end slavery and the horror of the American Civil War.Best Performance: Daniel Day-Lewis",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Artistically & Politically Grand,"Daniel Day Lewis is the Academy Award winner for best actor in 2012, hands down, with this addition to his resume of great acting parts. He truly IS Abraham Lincoln as well as we can know the man over 100 years later. How does a Brit (of Irish & English decent) do that American accent and mannerisms so well? Don't know. But it's so worth the time and money to see this movie just because of DDL's performance.Now, regarding the movie...I loved it. It totally captured my imagination and transported me back to the Civil War era. Jumping right in at the time of Lincoln's Presidency, we are brought into this small but very important time in his legacy and our country's history. The accompanying actors are splendid with none, IMO, lacking although not holding a candle to DDL's performance. The cinematography and sets are splendid, and costuming was interesting and spot on for this film. The storyline moves nicely for a non-action flick and before I knew it, the movie was over! Good sign, I'd say.Interestingly, to take such a relatively small part of history and make it into a 2+ hr. movie that was entertaining and captivating was no small feat. Especially when one considers the genre...no car chases, no action, no sex, no ""language"" to speak of and no special noticeable effects. Grand mention needs to be made of Steven Spielberg's direction of this film. Had Spielberg written all over it as he's one director that seems to be able to bring out the kind of emotion and feeling that is rarely felt while watching a movie. Can anyone say, Best Director?Because some parts of American history is so lacking in education, to see the ""beginnings"" of the Republican party was eye-opening and I applaud Producers and Director for their passion (which is obvious) and their historical covering of such a great time in American history. Truly I am proud to be an American after watching this film. Teary-eye I clapped at the end along with others who probably felt similar kinds of emotions. Don't miss it on the Big screen.

Lincoln (2012),"In the midst of the American Civil War in 1865, President Abraham Lincoln (Day-Lewis) looks to try and finally get the Thirteen Amendment of the Constitution granted in order to abolish slavery. However it leads to conflict amongst the rest of the government as his cabinet attempt to land key votes in order to ensure the amendment goes ahead. Amongst those contributing include his former opponent Thaddeus Stevens (Jones) who becomes more supportive about the end of slavery despite his initial opposition against it. But as the war rages on, Lincoln's determination is strained by his personal life involving his wife Mary Todd (Field) and his eldest son Robert (Gordon-Levitt). However he refuses to back away from his audacious plan as he looks to make history.As with most cinematic biopics, Lincoln continues the trend of focusing on the personal challenges of its central character which the film does very well to highlight. Abraham Lincoln is not seen as this grand statue that historians have associated him as but instead he is depicted as a real man who questions his actions which allows the large ensemble of other characters to advise him about his tactics. In other words, you could say the film is more about the Constitution than of the actual leader which is why Spielberg chose to look at the impact the new regime could have on potential voters. When the Lincoln family aren't on-screen, the attention is switched to the many contributors that try to make a huge difference to the human race. However the theme of family, something which Spielberg has always highlighted in his previous films, is also touched upon as Tony Kushner's majestic (and dialogue-heavy) script gives us a chance to see how it affects Lincoln's personal relationships with Mary Todd and Robert. It is clear that these confrontations affect the President greatly but fortunately Kushner doesn't go too sentimental with that sub-plot and makes the amendment the main priority as part of the engaging narrative. Production value is another key factor of Spielberg's directing craft as his team rebuild a tumultuous period in American history whether it be the old-fashioned costumes or the sight of thousands of men lying dead on the battlefield. A clever piece of misc-en-scene comes from the interior scenes where dark rooms are used possibly as a symbol for the depression that Lincoln went through and some shades of light used to convey the possible hope he has of pushing the amendment. We should also not forget the important contribution of Spielberg's loyal composer John Williams (Oscar-nominated for the 48th time here) as he provides a sombre and engaging score which may not rank amongst his best but shows that he is still a composer at the peak of his powers. Talking of immense talent, Spielberg's overwhelming cast is something to marvel about as the flawless Daniel Day-Lewis delivers another exquisite performance in his titular role as the President. Given the few films he has done in a career spanning almost thirty years, Day-Lewis continues to immerse himself in his character as he inhabits a subtle performance which commands authority and at times, rare moments of anguish during his confrontational scenes with both his cabinet and his family. Sally Field gives fierce support as Lincoln's deranged wife who makes an impact as a loyal woman who struggles to overcome the traumatic loss of her son Winnie and uses that in her personal battle with Abe but also stands toe-to-toe in a more light-hearted scene where she ridicules Tommy Lee Jones's Thaddeus Stevens at a dinner party. As the third Oscar-winning member of the large cast, Jones brings his usual authoritative style to his character but also combines warmth and charisma to a man who changes his opinion on equality through his own personal life which is revealed nicely in the film's closing stages. Given the size of the support cast, there are too many well-known actors to talk about but the stand-outs range from David Strathairn's loyal secretary of state William Seward to James Spader's robust henchman Bilbo. As a fan of American television, it's also refreshing to see actors from two of my favourite shows pop up including Walton Goggins (The Shield's Shane Vendrell) and David Constabile (Breaking Bad's Gale).A couple of negatives that Spielberg loses focus on is Lincoln's sub-plot with his son Robert and the disjointed ending. With the former, Joseph Gordon-Levitt continues his progress as one of Hollywood's biggest stars but his performance as the President's rebellious son is rather limited and feels more like a filler role which only attracts interest in his confrontational scenes with his father. The final five minutes also threatens to derail the film which could have easily ended with the President walking down his hallway. But instead, Spielberg opts to carry on and show Lincoln's assassination but not the way we expected to which leaves an unsettling feeling that almost takes away the inspirational mood we had experienced a few scenes earlier.Despite its manipulative ending, Spielberg's fascinating and masterful drama documents a crucial time in American history with Daniel Day-Lewis once again absorbing himself in his dominant role as Lincoln while surrounded by a who's who of versatile cast members.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I loved the movie,"The subject of Abraham Lincoln life and all of his many accomplishments is just too big a scope for one 2 1/2hr movie to cover. I like that Steven Spielberg decided to limit it to his last few months in office and to a subject he felt so very strongly about. I wish that he would do a miniseries to include much more of Lincoln's life from humble beginnings on - that would be awesome. You see glimpses of all the different factions he had to deal with including his family and realize the great amount of pressure the man lived under every day, and yet, dealt with what he had to with quiet grace and honor. Politicians of today would greatly benefit from lessons learned from Lincoln. Honor is dead in Washington and these are the people leading our country to ruin. Lincoln was known as a story teller to make his points and there are several interesting facts brought out in the movie that are not ""common knowledge"". I liked the ending...Spielberg made a great decision in not sensationalizing the inevitable end. The movie made me want to know more about the key people around Lincoln also. I hope that Daniel Day-Lewis receives the recognition he deserves for this wonderful performance I felt I was watching Lincoln himself an not an actor so I really hope he is nominated and receives an Oscar. Well done Mr Spielberg and Thank you Mr Day-Lewis.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
All Should See,"Lincoln was an excellent movie about a very important figure in national history - George Washington may be the father of our nation but Lincoln held it together and kept it from collapsing while still in infancy The movie captured this pretty well, probably the best a 2.5 hour movie could!The acting was exceptional and direction superb! This should have a great Oscar night and one of the few, Oscar winning movies, I would say I actually enjoyed!My only let down was the the lack of young people seeing the movie - My wife and I were one of the youngest couples in the movie and I fear education and immigration are destroying our national identity by allowing ""the people"" to forget our history!I recommend all Americans see this movie and take your children.There are some ""hollywood moments"" but you will not find a better movie to start a discussion about a time in our history that was both sad and exceptional!Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A New Classic – Beautiful!!,"When I saw the previews for Lincoln and found out that Steven Spielberg was producing and directing it, I knew I would be in for a treat. What I didn't know was how much of one.This movie was magnificent. I've not seen anything like it in years. There's so much to like the acting was exceptional (by all!), the set and costume design were top notch and the dialog was clever/wonderful. Lincoln is based on the book ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" by author, historian and Pulitzer-Prize winner Doris Kearns Goodwin who has chronicled the political lives of other past American Presidents. Essentially, ""Lincoln"" is about the passage of the 13th Amendment (after the Emancipation Proclamation had been passed and he had been re-elected) and how difficult it was for President Lincoln to get members of his party and even of his cabinet to pass it. Cleary much artistic liberty had to be taken with various parts of the movie's dialogue, but the House of Representatives dialog where many of its members would publicly stand to address each other and the issues at hand must have been accurate due to the reporters in the chamber! The reporters were the public record keepers writing down the words of the congressmen and publishing them in all of the popular and well regarded newspapers of the day which are probably available (perhaps at the Library of Congress?) for public viewing.I don't know what other movies will be competing for movie of the year or who will be competing for an Oscar with Daniel Day Lewis, but I sure hope this movie wins big. See this. I doubt you'll be disappointed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Big mistake sadly destroys the experience,"Let's be frank. If a high school student in a theater class were asked to write a play about Lincoln and his involvement in the North & South conflict that lead to the civil war. Wouldn't that student get scolded for not knowing which states were against slavery and which ones weren't? It's the kind of amateur mistake you don't expect to run across in a Steven Spielberg movie - and so it kind of ruined the rest of the story for me, as I was expecting other blunders to occur along the way.Apart from this, the movie captures a great deal of accurate details, picturesque scenes and episodes from that time line. The acting was quite good. Technically it could have been much better if the scenes weren't cut from so many different angles and close ups. It seems as though an attempt was made to speed up the dialogs through excessive cutting to accommodate the younger generation of hyperactive spectators. It's not a bad movie but in light of the big factual mistake I'd give it a merciful B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln,"When going to the movies, most search for pulse-pounding action, laugh-out-loud comedy, or grade-A scare shows. While, Lincoln is none of these things, it is, without a doubt, a great American movie. Spielberg sets the table for his film expertly by casting his roles perfectly and hiring some of the great production designers in the business to create the civil-war area world required to give the film its full force.At the center of his epic, playing none other than Mr. Lincoln himself, is one of the great actors of our time- Daniel Day-Lewis. Lewis creates a Lincoln so subtle, and so deep- that you instantly believe in the character. He speaks with a small, timid voice that is, in a way, also commanding and leader like. Abraham Lincoln has been called the father of our nation, and Lewis' Lincoln proves that title is fit. He plays the character with fierce passion, yet a warm spirit, and it'll blow you away.The supporting cast is equally brilliant. Sally Field, in one of the best performances of her career, plays Mrs. Lincoln. Spielberg's film combined with Field's tenacity help to distinguish how much of an impact Mrs. Lincoln had in history. Give credit where credit is do- and credit is due here. She speaks with Lincoln constantly- and is very aware of the political situations he deals with. She is very opinionated and voices those opinions with a heart and soul most actresses couldn't project as well as Field does. Tommy Lee Jones is also very good; however, once the Oscars come around, he may have a difficult time beating out Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who was phenomenal in ""The Master.""As for a more detailed overview of how this baby stacks up Oscar-wise, there are several awards it'll definitely be up for- Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor and Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Art Direction. It may be up for a few more- but those are the definite. For the intelligent moviegoer, Lincoln is a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good. Not really great.....,"Day- Lewis, of course, is terrific in this. Sally Field kind of chewed the scenery a little. It did drag some; and I got that kind of Spielberg feel.....where it seems like he did audience surveys to come up with the final cut of the film.If you read history, the Tommy Lee Jones character (Thad Stevens) was not exactly the gruff but lovable curmudgeon that the movie depicts him. I doubt that the Lincolns really took their servant's opinion on civil rights into consideration, and Lincoln himself was a pure pragmatist on the slavery issue.Little nitpicking, but it's a good movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Accurately depicts the end of slavery,"This movie is set in early 1865 during an intense period in history. The Union and the Confederacy were trying to work out an end of the Civil War and the House of Representatives was debating the 13th amendment. The purpose of the 13th amendment was to free all slaves in the United States but it was also just a means to the end of the war. Lincoln did believe that all men should be free and that slavery was awful, which was depicted in this movie, but he also believed that passing this amendment would end the Civil War. In the movie, Abraham Lincoln and some Republican party members of the House convinced other Republicans and Democrats to vote to pass the amendment by offering them other positions in government. According to historians, this was accurate (historynewsnetwork.org). After all of their hard work, on December 6th, 1865 the 13th amendment was ratified and all slaves were free in the United States. Overall, this movie, ""Lincoln"", accurately portrayed the end of slavery.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A House Divided ...,"Steven Spielberg gives us a well rounded story regarding the passage of the 13th amendment to the US Constitution. It's focus is predominantly President Lincoln but Spielberg gives us a view into the politics and the performers that facilitated it's passage. He gives us a Lincoln who seems to understand the contradictions of his presidency... he wants equality, but used his war powers to declare martial law and suspend ha beaus corpus. This is more of a political drama then a morality play - the supporters of slavery(Democrats)are not portrayed as evil, vile or villainous.Spielberg also gives us a caring family man who dearly loves his sons and his wife, though he is at his ends because of her desperate longing for their son Willie who died in the White House from typhoid at 12. Sally Field should be nominated, Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones probably will be as well. The film is a bit 'stagey' at times, but that wears off - at 150 minutes, it passes quickly given all the talking and little 'action'. Spielberg avoids many of his more manipulative tricks (except maybe at the very beginning when Lincoln is talking to 2 black soldiers, then 2 white soldiers) to give us a pretty direct telling of this story - based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin book ""Team of Rivals"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the Most Boring Movies I Have Tried to See,"I had greatest expectations with ""Lincoln"", a movie that had twelve nominations to the Oscar, winning two of them and another fifty-seven wins and one hundred and two nominations. Unfortunately ""Lincoln"" is one of the most boring (if not the most) movies I have tried to see, since I slept after 60 minutes running time.""Lincoln"" may be interesting for American people and students of history since the biography of Abraham Lincoln is part of the history of that country and the movie seems to be very accurate about the efforts of this president to approve the Thirteenth Amendment to the US Constitution by the House of Representatives. It may be also interesting for students of cinema since performances, cinematography and costume design are top-notch. But for a common viewer like me, it is painful to watch. I prefer Spielberg making science-fiction movies. My vote is one.Title (Brazil): ""Lincoln""",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Drew me in,"After Washington this movie in my U.S. history class something about it really stuck with me and I wanted to watch it again. The acting in this movie is superb and carries this movie. In my opinion, Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens transform into their roles and truly become these men. Lincoln does a great job of showing the ""behind the scenes"" of politics, as Lincoln hires men to go around and persuade senate member against the thirteenth to vote for it, this adds a bit of fun into this politically stuffed movie. That being said this is a political movie, it can be confusing at times and a little dry, but you have to remember this isn't an action movie, you have to go in with the correct mindset. I would recommend this movie for mature audiences as the politics in this movie would lose the interest of a young gun looking for some action.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Daniel Day Lewis, the reincarnation of the best President of our History","I am not particularly a political movie fan but this one particularly touched my heart.This is not a biography of Abe, let's be clear on that point immediately. This movie is focused on a particular part of his life, the most defined moment of his Presidency: the ratification of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery in the United States of America.So this is about the debate and the multiple manipulations and negotiations leading to this decisive and historical vote. But this is also a movie about Abraham Lincoln and his tireless will to abolish slavery and end the Civil War which is tearing the country apart for 4 years, claiming thousands of victims including his eldest son who died in the very first years of the conflict.I have to say that you couldn't find any finest actor than Daniel Day Lewis to incarnate Old Honest Abe. His performance is literally mesmerizing. I had the impression to see the real Abraham Lincoln throughout the movie and this is actually the sign of the greatest actors in the business. He is very sober but still remains impressive. His performance deserves praise and recognition. We don't see much of Daniel Day Lewis but we are not judging the talent of an actor or an actress by the number of movies he/she appears but by how his/her performances in each of the movies they did appear is touching each one of us and make it unforgettable. On this second point Daniel had proved how a legendary talent he is.The rest of the cast is following his path by performing in the right tone and attitude. Tommy Lee Jones is really awesome as Rep Thaddeus Stevens who is despising slavery as much as Lincoln and who is married to a black woman. Tommy is also a great actor and he can play everything to perfection. Having him and Daniel together is certainly the best asset of this movie.I think this movie is one of my favorites and I will have the pleasure to watch it again. If you haven't seen it yet you should.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not Bad,"First off, Lincoln has the best dialogue, the kind that you have to really think about, unlike the most other Tarantino/Guy Richy doppelgangers that are all flash and snazz (or fail).The sets are really nice from and seem authentic from a non-experts perspective.Daniel Day Lewis is amazing as well as the rest of the cast, although, Tommy LJ just couldn't pull it off for me, he just seemed too Tommy LJ, but he had grumpy down pat.The movie itself is OK but not jaw dropping, definitely a movie that must be watched twice and perhaps it will get better?Don't go in expecting a full BIO of Lincoln, you are only treated to a small snap shot of his life during the passing of the 13th amendment and a glimmer of his personality.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"This year, the Academy Awards will be drooling over a movie that is worthy of getting the gold","About a month before the release of Steven Spielberg's newest movie ""Lincoln,"" one of my fellow students in the film course I was taking at the time made what he perceived to be a very funny joke. We were discussing the pre-release hype for the picture and he, obviously not having seen it, said he was going to give away two spoilers as to what would happen: the 13th amendment would be passed and the president would wind up being shot in the head. The only profundity to come out of my colleague's remark (which only got token-chuckles from a few other students in the room) would, ironically enough, tie into one of the movie's ultimate strengths: the way it relies upon and bases its power upon the audience's pre-existing knowledge of its subject matter.Like any audience member over the age of ten, I knew walking in that Abraham Lincoln was the president who oversaw the end of the Civil War, the abolishment of slavery, and who ended up dead before the American South underwent Reconstruction. Mr. Spielberg, the director, and Tony Kushner, the screenwriter, obviously expected this of their audience, hence why their immensely powerful movie plays not as a history lesson but as a psychological study of what President Lincoln and the people he was associated with underwent during those heated years of 19th century America. We already know that slavery ends and the president dies, so what's the point of talking down on us about it? After all, this is not the story of some obscure man, but the most-loved president of the United States.Mr. Kushner's screenplay gains most of its strength in the backstage material: the politicians from both sides debating with each other, trying to win over the other side. This is a movie that is equally reliant upon supporting roles as well as the titular lead. As acted by Daniel Day-Lewis (virtually unrecognizable underneath all the make-up), Lincoln is presented as a cipher. An emotionally inspiring and coercive cipher, but a cipher nonetheless. And what he ciphers are the actions and reactions of the people underneath him: a sobering reminder that nothing in dictator-free politics, good or bad, can be achieved by one person alone. He makes the decisions and gives the oft-quoted speeches, but does not actually work the miracles himself. In fact, he's shown to be somewhat ignorant of what's going on around him. He knows there is a war and he knows that it is resulting in the deaths of many, but it is not until late in the third act, when he personally looks over the results of the Petersburg Campaign that he understands just how horrible things have become. Mr. Day-Lewis also makes the right acting choices by being restrained, not going for the cheap teary-eyed gimmicks for sympathy. So much more is accomplished with so little.One of the best performances in the movie is the one by Tommy Lee Jones, who plays Thaddeus Stevens as a withering, somewhat arrogant dreamer forced to deal several blows to his pride (in a marvelous courtroom sequence regarding the interpretation of slavery and freedom) to see an issue even opened up for debate. And this is just one example. It is refreshing to see a movie about achievement in which the victory is obtained by a team as opposed to just one man. In the passing of the 13th Amendment (again, giving this away is no spoiler, contrary to my former colleague's would-be funny remark), I felt a big wave of emotion rushing through me. But it was not emotion from having seen the amendment pass (as I knew it would happen all along) but as a sort of reminder of one of my country's most important landmarks.If only I could feel that good about what politicians in American do today.Some of the opening segments of ""Lincoln"" are a little stagnant. Good-looking as the interior art direction (White House scenes) is, I was beginning to grow tired of seeing every political and intellectual conversation being set in an ostentatious, glowing room with the camera zooming and dollying from spot to spot. Surely Lincoln must have had a few interesting powwows with somebody in the outdoors. I was also growing a little weary of every scene culminating with Honest Abe telling somebody a story. One of his anecdotes resounds with a very funny joke about George Washington, but for the sake of pacing, I would have recommended Mr. Spielberg to excise it and cut straight to the subsequent sequence of Lincoln being informed of the war casualties. For the former scene was only filling space before the latter.However, as the movie progresses (and many of the scenes shift to the outdoors) the momentum begins to pick up. And the silent stretches are even more fascinating as the dialogue-packed monologues. For Mr. Spielberg has yet to lose his ultimate gift: his acknowledgement that film-stories are told visually with the camera. That we can get dialogue from books and plays, but only movies can give us moving pictures.""Lincoln"" is not one of Steven Spielberg's masterpieces. The narrative structure is a tad uneven (Lincoln does not seem to have a real connection to either of his sons in the picture) and, again, the start is a little slow. But the film does have plenty in it to admire. After all, it goes on for 150 minutes and is much more gripping than any of Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" pictures, which were just as long and packed end-to-end with ear-stuffing explosions. This could very well be the best picture about Abe Lincoln's life since John Ford's ""Young Mr. Lincoln"" from 1940 and will most certainly be drooled all over come time for the Academy Awards. This time, however, they will be drooling over a movie that is worthy of getting the gold.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The set design is great, the music is amazing, the cinematography is top notch, and the script is perfect.Finally, the movie has a very timeless yet important message.

"It's Good, But A Bit Of A Surprise","There can be absolutely no doubt at all that the highlight of this movie is the superb performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. I've seen a number of his movies, and this is without a doubt his best piece of work. He becomes Lincoln in every way. Yes, the makeup is great. He looks the part. Physically he comes across as Lincoln. From everything I've read about Lincoln, he was tall and gangly and a bit awkward in his gait and stride. Day-Lewis got all that. But it was more than just that. I thought he captured the essence of the man. He was quiet and gentle; a soft-spoken story teller with a sense of humour. That was there. He was a political animal, making deals and dispensing patronage freely. This really was a fine portrayal of the man by Daniel Day-Lewis.And yet, strangely enough, the movie didn't overwhelm me. It was good, but I didn't think it was great. It surprised me a bit. I was expecting it to revolve around the Civil War and military matters. Instead, it was almost entirely focused on the fight to get the House of Representatives to pass the 13th amendment to the Constitution abolishing slavery. It's primary focus was the political struggle involved with that. In a way, it struck me as a sort of American version of ""Amazing Grace"" - which dealt with the fight to get a bill outlawing slavery through the British Parliament. All the major figures were included in the movie, but the point seemed to be that it was the minor players who aren't much remembered by history who gave the votes to pass the amendment, usually because their support was purchased by patronage appointments. There's also a brief but interesting portrayal of the River Queen Conference with Confederate leaders. With that focus, be aware that this movie isn't about Lincoln's life. It's really about the last four months of his life, focusing mostly on the last couple of weeks of January 1865.There were some good supporting performances, especially from Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, and Sally Field as Mary Lincoln, and some hints of the Lincolns less than perfect marriage. Less impressive to me was David Strathairn as William Seward. Another interesting performance in a limited role was Jackie Earle Haley as Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens.This is a good movie by all means, and worth seeing if you're interested in Lincoln or this period in history. It's also a must-see just for the performance of Daniel Day- Lewis. Hype aside, is it the best movie of 2012? Personally I wouldn't go that far. (7/10)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Four score and...,"It's really great. Daniel Day-Lewis is the best. Someone could film him sleeping for 3 hours and it would still be fascinating. He will definitely get another nomination and hopefully another win.The entire cast ranges from pretty good to excellent. Lewis, Field, & Jones should all get nominations. James Spader kinda steals the show at different points throughout but isn't likely to garner any attention. It's Spielberg's best film in quite a while IMO. Depending on who you are it could only be the best since last year's Tintin (or War Horse), but for me I'd say its the best since Munich or if you wanna go back even further, Saving Private Ryan.There is a scene at the end that I kinda feel they could've done without. It just felt slightly unnecessary to me. If the credits would've rolled after the scene directly before it then this could very well have been a 10 for me. All in all though it is still very very good and worth a watch for Spielberg and movie fans alike. And depending on how the rest of the potential Oscar contenders play out then this could be the film that receives the most nominations.Just because of the sheer insanity of it I'm going to list all of the names of the cast... Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Tommy Lee Jones, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, John Hawkes, James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, Michael Stuhlbarg, Jared Harris, Lee Pace, Hal Holbrook, Jackie Earle Haley, Bruce McGill, Walton Goggins, Lukas Haas, Dane DeHaan, and another few familiar faces that you've probably seen in other movies or TV shows but don't know their names. That cast alone should be enough of a reason to see the movie never mind the fact that the movie itself is fantastic as well, but its certainly made all the more possible because of Spielberg (and his crew) and this mammoth cast that was put together.

Perpetuates the myth,"The focus of screenwriter Tony Kushner and director Steven Spielberg's Lincoln biopic is very specific, following the presidents administration for a short period of around two months in early 1865. It is a significant moment in Lincoln's term as president, not just for the passing of the 13th amendment to the United States constitution, that would free the thousands of black slaves, but for a change in Lincoln's opinion of the black population. It is also a significant period for American culture as a whole. Lincoln's image and reputation are wholly constructed from this short time. In the opening scene, Daniel Day- Lewis' Abraham Lincoln, discusses the black experience, and a previous speech he conducted, with two black soldiers on the front line in the civil war, still raging five years since it began. This opening is critical to the change that he experienced when he saw young black men fighting for the Union against the Confederate army. Before this face- to-face encounter, Lincoln had been involved in the Emancipation Proclamation (passed in 1863), but actually had plans to deport the blacks out of the United States, if slavery were abolished, as he felt that blacks and whites could not co-exist.It is typical of all adaptations of Lincoln, ""The Great Emancipator,"" is that the 16th president has been mythologised even by many history scholars since his death in April 1865. Spielberg is no stranger to revisionist historical cinema, of course (Schindler's List (1993) and Saving Private Ryan (1998) instantly come to mind), as the director tends to hold onto an idealised sense of sentimentality, a heightened range of emotions. It's often a cheap trick in Spielberg's cinema, but in Lincoln, the screenplay does hint at a man who is a little ambiguous on the subject of race. Day-Lewis, in a scene on a porch with his wife's ex-slave confidante, Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben), he plays Lincoln with an awkwardness. He asks her what he thinks will happen to the black population if slavery was abolished. Is he uncomfortable because of his views on deportation, or is he exploring the idea of absolute freedom?Lincoln focuses it's attentions on the debates both in congress and behind the scenes within the seemingly cavernous rooms of the White House. The arguments and anecdotes about the meaning of freedom, and the race differences. The film attempts to show the bureaucratic and labyrinthine nature of policy change, let alone the grievances of changing the constitution written out in 1776. Tommy Lee Jones plays Thaddeus Stevens, a staunch opponent of slavery, and advocate of total freedom for blacks. As his story unfolds in congress, his secret personal life reveals itself almost revelatory in its conclusion.The American civil war was a brutal war, mechanised by the rise of the industrial revolution, leading to hundreds of thousands of dead and wounded. Whilst the scenes between son and wife are well scripted and acted, their presence seems secondary to what will, in part, contribute to awards heavy adulation of the Day-Lewis performance. Not only does he portray a president adored throughout history, but the script gives the actor a series of hyperbolic and anecdotal monologues. In practically all of Day-Lewis's performances, he has a moment in which he orates a lengthy, passionate speech, bringing stories to their emotional peek. In Lincoln, he almost explicitly has one of these fervent, impassioned moments, in every scene in which he is sitting. They are often humorous, but after a while, the obvious pleas for Oscar recognition, and fundamentally, to over emphasis the man as a great orator, and a man of complete honour and tolerance.Undeniably, the film is sumptuously beautiful to look at. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski conjures up a dark, candle-lit and fire- lit image when photographing inside. The minimal light, and contemporary decor, produces a palate of ochre's and earthy colours. When shooting outside, the grey of January winter bleeds from the sky into the skin of the characters, and the spacious clutter of buildings. The film juxtaposes these primitive images of the mid-ninetieth century surroundings with the very modern debates of morality and enslavement. There is a clear reason why Lincoln has been made in 2012. Lincoln's status as the emancipator of the black population, his image and his outstanding myth, were used during current president, Barack Obama's, presidential campaign in 2008. His myth is enduring (his Washington D.C. monument being the sight in which Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke publicly about the failure of the Emancipation Proclamation to truly free black people in America), but his (and Day-Lewis's) performance as a saviour and saint, would always win over a nation of people whose emotional attachment to their history can be easily manipulated and perpetuated through mass communication and fact and fiction merge to create an acceptable narrative.Lincoln is an interesting film. The machinations of politics are a subject that should be relevant to most people in this period where nefarious politics are happening in plain sight, but whose unknown activities are most likely darker and fundamentally scarier than is possible to imagine. This Lincoln has very slight moments of enigma, his character is at times inscrutable, but the film doesn't offer insight into these confusions of intention or social outlook. However, when these ambiguities present themselves, they are soon reversed by ever- present adoration of the historical figure, this is perfectly illustrated in the closing moments. The film uncomfortably and unnecessarily attaches Lincoln's death scene at the end (which occurred two or three months after the time period the film is set). A tactic that opens the film into stomach churning celebration and lionising, where his famous speech lingers over the ghost on Lincoln, the generic emotional music of John Williams echoing into the credits. It's a shame the filmmakers perpetuated the myth instead of penetrating a character whose true identity is clouded in over a century of storytelling, and pseudo-religious worship.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Wonderful trailer, shame about the film.","I was at the cinema with a friend of mine watching another film and we saw the trailer for this film and decided that it was worth watching on the basis solely of the content of the trailer. In retrospect that was not one of our better decisions. My friend kept nodding off during Lincoln and decided to leave at least an hour before the ending and do some shopping. I managed to stick it out and watch it through to the end probably because I wanted my monies worth. In my and certainly my friends opinion the trailer left us with completely the wrong idea about the content of this film. Neither of us are naive, biased or have the attention span of a goldfish but the film just didn't do it for us although the one and only good aspect for me was the performance of Daniel Day Lewis.

Review of the end of slavery,The movie Lincoln accurately portrays the ending of slavery good in some ways and worse in others. The movie's main topic was about Lincoln and the things he went through to actually get the amendment passed to end slavery. Although Lincoln did made a big part in the ending of slavery he was not the only factor. During the civil war the we're thousands of blacks fighting for their freedom. In the movie it shows the soldiers who fought for freedom but it was the only scene like it. For the movie in my opinion to more accurately depict slavery it should have showed more about the blacks and showed how they fought. The movie Lincoln I would say successfully portrayed part of the battle to end slavery. It showed Lincoln's part in ending slavery but lacked showing what the blacks did and how they contributed.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Great Portrait of Lincoln - Civil War President and Great Emancipator,"Lincoln, directed by Steven Spielberg, is a movie that shows the character of the man who was President of the United States and also the temper the era when America was divided against itself. We get a sense of Lincoln as a down-to-earth man with a gift for story telling glazed with some bawdy humour. We also see that he could wheel and deal with members of Congress to get what he wanted; in this case, the passage of an amendment to the Constitution to abolish slavery. The details seem to fit as we see the US Capitol appear gleaming white in cutaways as it had only recently been built. The viewer sees the President and his cabinet members wearing heavy clothing to keep warm during winter without indoor heating while meeting in the low light of candles and oil lamps. It appears that the President had time for many people who came into the Executive Mansion. Whether this is accurate is hard to know but it certainly was part of the character of the man shown in the movie. The buildup to the historic vote was met with opposition from some members of Congress who said they disliked slavery but were concerned about the results, including the right to vote - not only for blacks but for women. The President held firm that the vote was about slavery and nothing else. The cast deserves full credit including David Straithern as William Seward, the Secretary of State and Sally Field as the President's wife Mary Todd Lincoln; Tommy Lee Jones performed as a Congressman strongly opposed to slavery who fended off attacks that blacks and whites would be treated as equals, noting that his white colleagues were not equal. In the end, the vote was very close but Lincoln had won the battle. I was sorry I hadn't seen this movie earlier, which would have helped me appreciate Gettysberg and the house in which Lincoln died, not to mention the Lincoln Memorial. The movie also gives a warmer and more realistic image of Lincoln than the iconic character in the previous Lincoln movies. Steven Spielberg has another feather in his cap with this great cinematic history lesson.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Alexis Gabriele,Overall this movie was quite informational. This movie portrayed the side that Lincoln freed the slaves quite well. It shows the efforts to proceed and succeed to pass the 13th amendment. The effort shown by Lincoln showed how dearly he cared for the slaves and their freedom. Daniel Day Lewis played the part of Lincoln to a T. Which is not unusual for him. Lincoln was a very smart and witty man. Lincoln is a rough and noble democratic masterpiece. He had a way with the people. But he had reasons for freeing the slaves. There were many advantages such as moral advantage. Also it would demolish the Souths economy because their economy was mainly based on slaves.,,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln,"Last year USA-born Meryl Streep won her third Oscar for the portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in THE IRON LADY (2011, 7/10), this year the academy will (seemingly) reciprocate a third Oscar to Brit Daniel Day-Lewis in his rendition of Abraham Lincoln. It's a fair trade, both represent the highest echelon of acting supremacy, a biographical piece of world-known historical figure is the safest touchstone.But LINCOLN is directed by Steven Spielberg, an industrial tycoon who has nothing to lose and at the same time nothing could surpass his previous accomplishments. Last year WAR HORSE (2011, 7/10) and THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN (2011, 9/10) didn't exactly restore his capability as a superb director, but leading this year with 12 Oscar nominations, no one can argue it is the best chance for Mr. Spielberg and his team to attest their credentials and may be exulted with the glory.I watched this film in a local cinema, being an non-American and a politics apathetic, the film doesn't grow on me as it should, it has its undeniable merits (an intimidatingly detailed script from Tony Kushner and a first-rate collective work from all the thespians, to name a few) and if its ultimate goal is to reach a more geographically diverse demography, call me pessimist, the outlook seems bleak.Since the plot is a no-brainer, this is a battlefield for brilliant thespians, like a Shakespeare play, everyone is howling and bellowing, inveighing and swearing, with a scattering of bons mots and repartee. But how much viewers can feel in Lincoln's bones while watching this film? History is always written by the winners, since Lincoln is a valiant winner, whose conscientious endeavor to abolish the slavery may seem to be more like a political decision other than out of a visceral compassion as a human being, his stratagem can out-wit all those brains around him, the film, is well-positioned as a paean to American's beloved leader, Mr. Spielberg has been never so unassuming since his extraordinary career path.The almighty Daniel Day-Lewis will be an insuperable crest for any actor in the drama range, whose congenital talent and meticulous preparation for his roles can spontaneously set up a bona fide paragon in actor's kingdom. His Lincoln is a mystery, a distanced role-model of the generations, a ""perfect man""in almost every aspect, but his struggle and ordeal still penetrates from within. Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones, luckier than other supporting roles, clinch their showboating emotion burst and excavate their Oscar-worthy depths in their characters, two textbook supporting nominations are well-deserved.The film is a high-caliber biographical flagship, but film should serve us a bit more than being a (politically) fly-on-the-wall machine to recount what had happened (who can tell what is the truth anyway), and highlight some uplifting moral triumphs, if it can spike its main course with some unexpected cinematic wizardry, then it will be a huge bonus. Nevertheless, supposedly no one will grudge too much if it wins big (e.g. BEST FILM & BEST DIRECTOR apart from DDL's third naked Golden stature) in the upcoming Oscar battle, afterward, Oscar is profoundly USA-tagged, it has its proverbial boundaries, but who doesn't?",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Goodness Yes!,"Golly Gee Willacker's ""Hat"" man! I think that Daniel Day Lewis outdid himself on this one. I am impressed by all parties responsible for making this one and the conception of it really drove to be an award winner. The acting was worth watching this movie for alone. The incredible portrayal of the finest President to walk the face of the earth. In watching this I felt drawn to fact, reminded of Lincoln's intellect and profoundly entertained by what I was seeing was someone else's view of ""Lincoln"". Boy oh boy do I feel guilty for not knowing who Daniel Day Lewis was before this. ""Last of the Mohican's"", ""Gang's of New York- 'Bob the Cutter'"", and now this! Wow, my advice to anybody is try to portray him as one of the greatest, I mean ""take it slow"". That is what he is doing and it is paying off. ""Last of the Mohican's"" by the way is one of my favorite soundtracks. I now want to read the book from David McCullough- when and if he does it. What a daring triumph. It's not like nobody cares, everyone is going to be particular about this one. Did he/they pull it off, yes!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Good but not great,"I will start by saying this movie is good but not great. It is worth watching but it will not become a classic like many other movies of the Civil War era, such as Gettysburg. What I was expecting was more comprehensive biography of Lincoln. What I got was one little slice of his life surrounded by many other characters. As many reviewers have said, this should be called a movie about the 13th amendment not about Lincoln. Almost all of it takes place in January of 1865 and involves Lincoln's fight to get the amendment passed. The movie gets very slow and tedious in the middle with all the wrangling.Considering the subject it could have been shorter and ending with the passing of the amendment. The assassination seem to be a add-on which could have been left out. It is a movie you go to see for the scenery and the performances not for the story.When I saw the trailer I had my doubts about Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln, but I have to say he pulls it off. He will almost certainly get a nomination for his acting. Probably the best character is Thaddeus Stevens played by Tommy Lee Jones. He pulls it off perfectly. If you look up the picture on Wikipedia of Stevens, Jones looks just like him. For a Spielberg movie I as disappointed in the special effects. Much of it was obviously green screen. The carriage rides though the city were so obvious green screen that it was distracting. The riverboat that was obvious built on a back lot and had no water under it was a big blooper. As a huge Civil War and Lincoln fan I am glad I went to see it but I would not rush out to see it again any time soon.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not bad but a bit of a let down,"I had high hopes for Lincoln, one of most respected figures in American History. We know there was a lot of material that could be dramatized regarding this great man's life. However I was quite disappointed. The film only focused on a certain part of his life. Now if you direct it with enough finesse and make it captivating then it could be a great film. This has been done successfully with 13 Days about the JFK and the Cuban Missile Crisis. However this period of Lincoln's life was dramatized in quite a dull manner as it followed the legislative hurdle Lincoln faced. It was disappointing to take such a large figure like Lincoln and make a film about his battles with Congress when there was so much more that occurred in his life that was more eventful and entertaining.If one were to make a film today about JFK with the tag line JFK or Kennedy one would expect a more complete and eventful dramatization of his life. We would not expect Kennedy spending most of the film fighting with Congress and observe a 100 days worth of this legislative battle. Therefore it follows that a film called Lincoln or about him should have been more complete and eventful or if it were about a period, choose an interesting period. Congress and political battles are not worth dramatizing. Perhaps the title should have been renamed to 'The Bill' or Emancipation Bill or something specific.Besides the big flaws the acting was very good and DDL deserved an Oscar for his portrayal.6.5",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great movie for a great man,"I've watched this movie a half dozen times. It's become one of my favorite movies, which is a bit ironic because I so carefully avoided watching it when it came out. Everyone kept talking about Daniel Day-Lewis's performance, but I knew it was one of those quieter, historical pieces and I wasn't in the mood. Finally, it aired on HBO some weekend and I thought I might as well see what all the fuss was about.I remember just being completely blown away. Before I'd even reached the half-way point I was on the web ordering a Blu-Ray copy of the film. The movie is, in my opinion, a masterpiece. To me, that comes down to one thing: Daniel Day-Lewis. Don't get me wrong, the supporting cast is extremely solid, and the cinematography is gorgeous; even the costumes and set pieces are beautifully done.But what brings me back again and again is Lewis's performance of the great man. In every scene, he just seems to suck the oxygen out of the room; I almost feel as though I've been holding my breath while I watch his scenes unfold. Of course, I have no way of knowing what Lincoln was actually like, but it just feels like Lewis captured the essence of everything I imagine Lincoln was like. That aura of intelligence and sadness, of a love for the common man combined with the knowledge that he will never truly be one of them. And just below the surface, disguised by the easy charm of a master storyteller, a will of pure iron that will lead the nation, even to places they might prefer not to go.Even in rooms full of people, Lewis paints a portrait of a man who stands alone. Always quiet and thoughtful, to the point that you just begin to suspect he might not be paying attention, and then he speaks and reveals a profound depth of intelligence. Not the arrogant intelligence of someone who dismisses those of lesser capacity, but a grounded, earthy intellect that embraces the views of everyone around him. In short, Lewis creates a vision of Lincoln that I would like to believe is true, given his importance to our nation and its history.If you haven't seen it yet, I can't recommend this movie enough. I may be wrong, but I think 'Lincoln' will go down as a great movie with several wonderful performances and one magnificent performance by one of acting's greats at the height of his ability.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The Thirteenth Amendment,"Yet another historical subject directed with the same fussy photography and at the same stately pace one expects from Spielberg when dealing with Olden Times and Big Subjects. The title - as so often - suggests a biography but in fact deals only with a short period of the subject's life; in this case the labours in the face of failing health and domestic discord to steamroller the 13th Amendment through Congress in January 1865.Fascinating if exhausting, with a towering performance from Daniel Day-Lewis as an equally exhausted Lincoln working hard against the clock to secure his legacy; for which history - if not his contemporaries - remains grateful.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I was particularly glad they didn't relive the assassination. But!!!!!!! although every attention to detail was payed and the cream of the crop on both sides of the camera were brought to bear, it's not something that couldn't be equally compelling in a discovery channel re-enactment.The film is deliberately drab and far from uplifting epics like the patriot, it felt like they were going for gritty realism without the grit and the only realism on display is Day Lewis likeness to honest Abe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Abraham Lincoln was born February 12th, 1809","Steven Spielberg dips back into the world of biopic story-telling by tackling the last year of Abraham Lincoln's time in the White House. Spielberg starts out the film by giving us a dose of Saving Private Ryan (1998), rather quickly, by reminding us of the brutality of the American Civil War, which rages outside Lincoln's window, not very far from Washington, DC.Spielberg also reminds us how the slavery divide played a big role on both sides during these years, by showing us black soldiers fighting for the Union. It is these two directions that clearly define this film. Sometimes we do forget exactly what Lincoln did for this country and for this world. We must remember that in the last year of his presidency (which ended prematurely, due to his assassination, plus he died during the first year of his second term), he had to deal with a two-prong problem. He had to end slavery and end the war. Spielberg, convincingly, shows us how the stress and anxiety took its toll on our 16th President.After we see this quick battle-scene in the beginning, Lincoln meets a couple of the black Union soldiers and the film turns towards the biopic. We then see, in detail, what it took to make these two horrible curses on our country go away. This is a meticulously crafted film. Spielberg tries very hard to combine the popular Hollywood-type entertainment, without losing the important history lessons, detailing exactly what it takes to make law in the land. He makes the boring political environment more enjoyable, by crafting these plot requirements with some amazing acting talent too. I was happy to see James Spader in the film. This film succeeds where others might fail, due to Spielberg's brilliant ability at story-telling.8.1 (B MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best Movie... Seriously?,"Looking at the reviews, I wanted to be completely blown away by this movie when I went to see it. I saw the new James Bond film and Twilight, and to my surprise they actually exceeded my expectations. The movie Lincoln started off very interestingly. I would say that they really had some good actors, and as far as an Abraham Lincoln... damn did they do a mighty good job. We are all taught as kids that the Civil War is about slavery, though that is pretty inaccurate, I think anyone can play along. But this movie really was depicted inaccurately, that in a way I find it insulting. As a historian, one of the wars that got me into learning about History was the Civil War and how devastating it was for both sides. This movie took away from that and basically just made it a war about slavery. I also thought the acting was so cheesy. You have the big bad southerners who's speech is so unattractive, mean, nasty. Then you have the smart northerners who are just so smart at saying what they are saying, they even make the audience snicker. The Blacks were all dressed in expensive nice looking clothing. Seriously? And now for some reason they all turned out to live in the streets of New York and Chicago. About 80% of the union soldiers were black. If you do a little more research you'll find they were for the most part immigrants. The lines everyone said in this film were all stereotypical, made up, and cheesy. It was like everyone was trying to be poetic every single time they spoke. Lincoln and his wife are fighting and they are basically just arguing poetically. SOOOO CHEEESY!A few other things I didn't like were how cold Lincoln was made to appear. He actually wanted to end the war and preserve the Union. I also think this movie was pretty long. It was too long. The Gettysburg movie showed a better depiction between north and south and clearly showed how devastating and cruel the war brought one another. It did it in about the same amount of time. What's even sadder is that you only see Lincoln's last few months as President. It hardly gives you a good picture of what he was as a leader.So in other words, you have a long movie that is historically inaccurate, really unnecessarly poetic and cheesy. WHY DID YOU GUYS SAY IT WAS AN 8 OUT OF 10?!!! Bad taste in movies guys. I will never watch this movie again. I can tell you what, I will watch most movies that aren't so good or even bad for the sake of spending ones time. But this movie really was too extreme to sit through again. I watched Lord of the Rings SO many times. EVEN THOSE MOVIES DON'T DRAG ALONG LIKE THIS ONE!Best movie of the year? Seriously? Biggest disappointment of the decade! You had wonderful actors, an awesome director, and the story plot was already written out with history books. You also had the best president in the last century. NO WAY THE BEST MOVIE. What the heck is wrong with you guys? My only hope is there will be enough people after twilight that will put this rating at the right rate.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Despite being far too dry, Daniel Day-Lewis makes this film with enough warmth, authority and iconography to justify the man himself.","I remember back when Lincoln was just a rumour. A rumour with Liam Neeson attached to star. It appeared like a dream team reunion too good to be true. Perhaps enough to redeem Spielberg's uninteresting last 10 years. Although I admire Daniel Day-Lewis, I must admit I was disappointed when Neeson dropped out, but now I can't picture anyone else. I love Day-Lewis' performances in My Left Foot and There Will Be Blood, but his Abraham Lincoln was on an unprecedented plain of acting I wasn't sure he was capable of and at least belongs among those two. He brings such warmth, authority and iconography to the role that it's upsetting when he's not on screen. Although the writing is almost like a play with far too much dialogue- driven scenes that it may as well be a filmed play, it develops his character very well with little human moments and profound philosophical ideas that are interesting just for the fact they come from such an important figure in American history.Unfortunately, the deliberately saturated aesthetics don't justify itself being a film, and pace aside (which is already pleasantly slow), it could've easily be exactly the same product on the stage. It has moments, but it's not nearly as cinematic as it could be. Granted, that makes it feel more mature for Spielberg, especially after having War Horse last year, but it also feels like a dry history lesson. I can already imagine the generations of American kids having to watch it that I feel like it already has the reputation it can only have in 10 years time. There are many opportunities to show and not tell that Spielberg doesn't take, the main one and most interesting one being not showing Lincoln's assassination. While that shrinks the scale of the film dramatically, it also shrinks the intimacy. So Lincoln is sitting somewhere in the middle, but it's certainly on the good side, elevated by its excellent performances. Although Sally Field is over-dramatic in her few scenes, Tommy Lee Jones subtle performance is thoroughly compelling and a highlight of the supporting cast along with David Strathairn and Lee Pace.Part passion project and Oscar bait, it's difficult to detach it from its awards hype. This is the last of the Oscar films I had left to see, and before Argo's reign, I went in expecting it to be a viewing of a Best Picture in the making. Personally, I'd consider them on a par, with Silver Linings Playbook and Les Miserables my favourites to win but only the former has a sliver of a chance. Lincoln feels like it was designed to be a Best Picture, sitting on the same shelf as Gandhi and The King's Speech, and in a way, it deserves to be, I just wish those films could actually be masterpieces, rather than crowd-drawers. If it wasn't for The Master, Day-Lewis would be an easy win but I look forward to seeing him onstage, most likely with Jones. I learned quite a lot from Lincoln, as I've never had a true history lesson on the man or events being not from the U.S.A. but a viewer is a visual learner more than anything and the actions of Lincoln speak louder than its words, despite the imbalance of ratio. At least it somewhat lives up to the promise of the premise and talent.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Pulls You In,"In a film like this the last thing you would want is for the film makers to be historically illiterate. Usually it takes a sharp eye to catch that but this film takes no time and right at the very start destroys your confidence in the film's accuracy by calling the north free. That put me on the edge and I couldn't just relax and enjoy the rest of the film.And yet despite that early blunder Lincoln did turn out to be a great film that was superbly acted. It was a film where the main character gave many speeches and told strange tales that went nowhere. Usually saying that would mean criticising the film but here it's made to work. You want to keep watching Daniel Day-Lewis. The movie pulls you in and doesn't let you go until the end.It also looks spectacular. It has the type of gorgeous visuals that you'd want in a grand historical epic. If only it was one, because while the story is good it is somewhat lacking. Generally politics doesn't make for the most interesting story subject and that maybe the films problem.But overall Lincoln is the type of film you would expect from Steven Spielberg in terms of quality and I highly recommend it to fans of historical drama.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Informative, Engaging & Enlightening, Lincoln Is Essential Viewing","Helmed by one of the most celebrated filmmakers of all time & starring the greatest actor of his generation in a truly iconic role, Lincoln is an elegantly crafted, meticulously detailed & patiently narrated biopic that attempts to capture on screen the legacy of Abraham Lincoln; considered by many to be the greatest President in United States history and for the most part, it simply works.Set in 1865 during the American Civil War, Lincoln chronicles the final four months in the life of US President Abraham Lincoln & focuses on his efforts to pass a landmark constitutional amendment that aims to abolish slavery forever from the United States. With thousands of people getting slaughtered everyday, Lincoln races against time to secure the future of his nation by obtaining enough votes before it is too late.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the 21st century has been a semi-retirement mode for the revered filmmaker but every once in a while, he does give us a glimpse of why he is one of the best in the business for Lincoln is crafted with precision attention to detail & accuracy, is highly character-driven & technically sound. Tony Kushner's script is another little gem that's patient with its content & takes a methodical approach in bringing the story to life.Production design is stellar for the story really benefits from its authentic set pieces. Same can be said about the costumes as well. Cinematography makes excellent use of lighting & camera movements. Editing is where Lincoln becomes a two-way street for its deliberately slowed down pace makes the drama more immersive for some while for others, it becomes a snooze fest. And John Williams' music is yet another mesmerising addition to Spielberg- Williams collaboration.But what actually saves the film & makes it worth sitting through all the frustrating & snail- paced narrative is the breathtaking performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln. Nailing the looks, mannerisms & possibly the voice as well, Day-Lewis absolutely steals the show & it's hard to look elsewhere when he's on the screen. Sally Field ends up being a bit hammy in her role of Mary Todd Lincoln while Tommy Lee Jones is as reliable as ever in his rendition of Thaddeus Stevens.On an overall scale, Lincoln may not be what mainstream audience like to call ""entertaining"" due to its dialogue-driven plot, glacial pace, political storyline & lack of action but it still makes up for an engaging & informative historical drama that sheds an interesting light on the legend whose oratory skills & leadership qualities has continued to inspire & influence the politics around the world. Riding on Spielberg's assured direction & bolstered by Day-Lewis' knockout performance, Lincoln comes thoroughly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Freedom,"Of fine artistry and quality ""Lincoln"" is a historic epic of towering figures and the challenges they surmount in the tumultuous and monumental times they lived in. In the final year of the American Civil War president Abraham Lincoln is eager to pass emancipation for black slaves amidst bitter opposition as he juggles politics, war and his personal life. Shot in dark tones the film exquisitely depicts 19th-Century American life. Director Steven Spielberg successfully gains solid performances from the actors with Daniel Day-Lewis portraying a warm and sympathetic Lincoln wearied and aged by the tremendous and historical task set before him.

good movie,The Lincoln movie was a 7 out 10 there was a lot of parts of the movie that was good and some other was bad but things i find interesting was how most of the white man didn't want black people to vote or to have rights as white man but also how it last a long time before they vote on the matter and that people didn't like the fact the of lincoln making equally rights with black and white but more of as in the democratic wanted to keep things they was with their slave and not having same rights as the black but in the end of the movie how lincoln got what he wanted that past the law that all men should be equally and have rights as a black man but in middle of the movie their son wanted to be in the army and they want him to die and other things but to me i feel like the actor did a good job on how lincoln was back then trying to give all people rights and freedom make them as equally.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Tribute to one of our Greatest Presidents,"I saw this movie 3 times! I NEVER do that. But it was so very brilliant I had to see it again, and then one more time. And of course, each time I caught something I had missed. The first time, one is doing their best to keep up with the story line. But in a story of substance which is rendered so artfully and sensitively, subsequent viewing allows one to pick up the nuances and contemplate its message. And I learned a lot. That Lincoln was a very skillful and savvy politician. No doubt a skill honed during his years as a practicing attorney. I also didn't realise that close to the end of the war, Lincoln was presented with a very tempting offer by the South to end the war but which would allow the so called Confederate states to carry on as usual. But he chose to push through to make his Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 a reality. A political gamble he won, but just. By a hair and at a time when his entire cabinet was pressuring him to do otherwise, to take the easy way out. Daniel Day Lewis as Lincoln was beyond brilliant. Also loved the story telling scenes. And his Secretary of State who would get so tried with him, failing to realise it was Lincoln's stress release. Day Lewis also took great pains to imitate what history books described as Lincoln's vocal pitch and manner of speaking. And the scenes with Mary Lincoln were superb. Sally Field made an exceptional performance--the interchange between her and her husband over the death of their young son was one of the movies' very memorable scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
I can understand how some people would find this movie boring...It's still a good film.,"Now I can completely understand how some audiences was bored to tears while watching this movie and I can understand how some audiences actually enjoyed this movie for what it is. It's kinda like the movie ""Citizen Kane"" how it can come off as a boring movie but you might have to ponder upon it to appreciate it. If your expecting some good amount of action you will be very disappointed. Since this movie is just filled with dialogue that inspires but mainly it's the performances and the cinematography/production is what drives this movie. Steven Spielberg is one heck of a director and this is hands down a very well directed movie. The cinematography with the backgrounds and costumes makes it kinda seem your with the characters as they tried to get the 13th amendment passed. In fact this whole movie isn't a biography of Lincoln but about a big part of his life. When him and some of the members of his cabinet tries to push for the 13th amendment to get passed. I will admit for some parts of this movie I was bored but it did have it's moments, actually it had a lot of them. Although I was bored during some parts of this movie. As it progresses I started to get more immersed into what was going on. And even though most audiences will know how everything goes down there is a bit of tension and that is fine directing. All the cast did a amazing job with there roles which is the main part of this movie and it would take way too long to type all the positive things about there performances. But since Daniel Day-Lewis plays Abraham Lincoln...He was just perfect for this role, especially with his soft spoken manner in this. Since that is how I pictured Lincoln to talk like, cause sometimes the soft spoken manner is more effective than talking with a booming dominant voice. Although it can be effective as well sometimes like when it came to Thaddeus Stevens(Tommy Lee Jones). And although I like Liam Neeson, I am glad Daniel got this role and he most definitely deserve awards for this performance. It would have been a huge waste if this movie was not made because of Daniel Day-Lewis. And I give respect to Steven Spielberg for at least trying to stay in touch with history instead of throwing a whole bunch of stuff that didn't even happen. At first I was gonna give this movie a 7.4 but after pondering about it I personally think this movie deserves an 8/10.8/108/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

My father and I agreed that this is the type of movie that will be shown at school because movies garner more interest than text can.

Very mediocre,"This was a wholly mediocre film. Neither tremendously gripping nor completely boring, it ranged somewhere in between. I did not come away from the movie with a better feeling for the true Lincoln in the final months of his life, and the movie itself was not anything to behold. Of course, trying to capture the essential Lincoln is certainly not an easy task, but this characterization came across as somewhat aloof, with the President frequently telling his unique stories to his own amusement and sometimes without a recognizable context. The historical events were poorly integrated into a larger context, and the way the last four months were focused was too myopic in my view. I imagine this film to be the sort that an AP U.S. history teacher shows when he or she is off of work for a couple days, but probably only because that person teaches in Illinois and showing this film is proverbial in the ""Land of Lincoln."" Although most of the other people I went with seemed to enjoy this work, I left the theater still in search of an accurate and rich film portrayal of one of the greatest U.S. Presidents.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The movie was great! Missed the part on the accuracy to what really happened.,"The film Lincoln accurately portrayed the end to slavery.

Thus being said without the president have a strong feeling against slavery, the abolitionists wouldn't of stood a chance against ending slavery and passing the 13th amendment. In the film Lincoln, Abraham himself is constantly stressing to pass the 13th amendment to end slavery. He spent countless hours trying to gather votes to to pass the amendment. Without his support on this campaign, the votes most likely would have favored to not pass the amendment.

Leadership knowhow,Lincon is one of its kind depicting extreme leadership it clearly demonstrates how a leader should be and what should he demand from his subordinates- excellence -and nothing else.Daniel day-lewis did an outstanding performance and he acclimatised Linconin the true sense.Movie is full of witty stories which makes it more hilarious to watch.For me this movie was very informative since it was the first time i tasted American history.Lincon had a vision to unite America he owned that vision and articulated to his close aides and did everything beyond his powers to achieve the vision of emancipating the slaves.A must watch for all those who are true seeker of leadership spirit.,6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"No need for time machine,I just encountered Lincoln!!!","Steven Spielberg directs Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, a revealing drama that focuses on the 16th President's tumultuous final months in office. In a nation divided by war and the strong winds of change, Lincoln pursues a course of action designed to end the war, unite the country and abolish slavery. With the moral courage and fierce determination to succeed, his choices during this critical moment will change the fate of generations to come.The screenplay by Tony Kushner was based in part on Doris Kearns Goodwin's biography Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, and covers the final four months of Lincoln's life, focusing on the President's efforts in January 1865 to have the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution passed by the United States House of Representatives.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Not that great for a Spielberg film...,"As a character study, this film's great. As a time capsule, this film's outstanding. But as a film as a whole, well- meh. It's okay at best.Of course, there IS a lot of good in this film. The editing is superb, and it really triumphs in recreating the 1800s era. Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible as Lincoln, and all of the supporting cast is truly great as well. The music by John Williams is good as always.However, it may be just me, but this film did a terrible job of holding my attention. I know it's a historical film, and it's not supposed to be that exciting, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be gripping. And this film had little to no grip.Seriously, if it weren't for Day-Lewis, I would have been bored out of my seat. There are some good choices in the writing, but I found myself caring less every second, even if it's Spielberg, which is probably the most disappointing thing about this movie.When you think about Spielberg, you think about cinematic triumphs like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws or Jurassic Park. Forget those exciting films, but films like Catch Me If You Can or Minority Report, films with a good GRIP. You don't feel that bored while watching them.So, if you want to see some good production value or good acting, watch this film. Otherwise, stick to Schindler's List.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Close your eyes and listen,"My only comment is regarding the voice used by Mr. Day-Lewis in his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln. I have read about the decision to use a higher voice and that it is supposedly more historically accurate as ""sources described Lincoln's voice as thin and reedy"". Unfortunately, I'm afraid I can no longer take this seriously. The problem (and once I noticed this phenomenon, I could not get past it) is that if you close your eyes, you cannot help but notice that the voice of Mr. Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln sounds almost exactly like that of the famous Mr. Burns from ""The Simpsons"". I'm serious. In fact, listen to the trailer available here on IMDb and you will hear it for yourself!",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Gripping, majestic: the power of words..","It is all but impossible to render true justice to a man as great as Abraham Lincoln but Steve Spielberg does a fantastic job aided by a truly great performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Some reviewers complain about the amount of dialogue (and presumably therefore, a lack of action), but this a film about momentous political events in a nation's history, inspired by a one of the great figures of the ages. It is about morality, decency, principles and the compromises made to achieve an historic aim. It could easily have been dry and boring, but the superb direction, writing and acting by w wonderful ensemble ensure that it is compelling viewing with plenty of tension, even if one knows the eventual outcome. I loved Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal which emphasises the quiet, steady and steely determination of Lincoln to bring the Civil War to an end through the abolition of slavery. Lincoln like Churchill, new the power of words to inspire, persuade and achieve great things and Daniel Day-Lewis brings this triumphantly to life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A well-made and deeply affecting historical drama,"The film ""Lincoln"" brings us back to a defining moment in the American history, namely the pass of the Thirteenth Amendment; and tells about the last four months' life of Abraham Lincoln, one of the most beloved American presidents. It is definitely one of the best historical drama ever, thanks to its brilliant screenplay, original score, acting performances, costume, production design, hair/makeup, and cinematography. The several monologues and speeches delivered by Daniel Day-Lewis is among the finest moments of his splendid acting career.

"This One Is For The Prose, The Epic & Sheer Amendment!","The most crucial, entertaining and amazing time period in this movie of over 150 minutes is from 110th minute to 130th minutes.

Spielberg chooses to be more of a verbal in this rather than the remaining aspect as compared to his other masterpieces. Music is sharp, screenplay adaptation is better, so is the photography. But, the modern and ancient flaw is to mediocre to find. But it sure grabs some brownie points over the history and research.Niceties have been taken care of and that is what matters if you are to make a movie on Abraham Lincoln.

Good movie,"The movie ""Lincoln"" may have some people who believe that it did not correctly show how the abolishment of slavery really happened, but I think that the movie did accurately show how slavery ended. The reason I think that the movie accurately depicts how slavery ended was because Lincoln went through very many steps and tried hard to make sure that they got enough votes to make the abolishment of slavery happen. In the movie it shows this by showing how many votes it took to make owning a slave illegal. It showed how many arguments the abolishment made and it clearly depicted how much effort Lincoln put into abolishing slavery. You could also see in the movie how emotional Lincoln was because of how strongly he wanted this law to be passed. Besides the fact that no one called anyone a ""fatuous nincompoop"" the ending of the film ""Lincoln"" accurately portrays how it really happened.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A movie that is interestingly not about Lincoln.,"This is a very good movie and I found it extremely interesting as I had limited knowledge on the civil war. But I will say this, it is a movie that you must focus on or you lose track of what is happening. It was a little slow in places and I was confused as to why some characters were introduced when they provided little substance to the story.And yes I must agree that as other reviews have mentioned this is not a movie about Lincoln. Although I do wonder if maybe people have put too much pressure on his legacy as a great leader. Maybe he was just a man who did one exceptional thing in history and was dull in every other aspect of his life. Isn't that all we can expect from a great leader, that they affect change and implement one great thing. The way the system works we are lucky if they accomplish anything during their time in power.All in all I did enjoy this movie and maybe I might watch it one more time to pick up anything I missed. After that though I believe it will fall into the masterpiece that you watch once in your lifetime category.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Amazingly crafted, very convincing indeed","Spielberg has dramatized the most difficult months of Lincoln's presidency in intimate and sympathetic detail. I remember the way Lincoln would connect with his audience, share an anecdote and immediately lighten up the atmosphere. He seemed like an immensely likable man. When the moment demanded, he could also be tough and exercise the power his charisma granted him over others. The film focuses on the visionary that he was, the realist he had to become to achieve his vision and the certainty he had in his beliefs. The one thing that separated him from his peers was the ability to seek out the important from the inane. It is shown that he was aware of the historical moment that was upon them in the form of the Thirteenth Amendment, and he 'cepit diem'.Daniel Day Lewis has given us a remarkable performance. It is very hard to make out that the Lincoln we see brooding and connecting is actually an actor; someone for whom perfection has almost become a religion. The intensity of the gaze, the quiet voice, the slightly hunched posture, the thin grizzled beard have almost reanimated a history chapter.The movie also delves into the personal conflicts of the great man. His own son joins the army, and he is faced with the tough choice between ending the war or passing the bill to abolish slavery. One could save his son and the other could save millions of people from a life of servitude. He doesn't back down, and the immaculate politician he was, manages to do both.This is amazingly crafted, very convincing indeed. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.""If in pursuit of your destination, you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp, what's the use of knowing True North?""",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Wonderfully done,"Lincoln is wonderful and Daniel Day-Lewis performance in this movie is worth his academy award nomination as Best Actor, Day-Lewis has twice won the Academy Award for Best Actor for the movies My Left Foot in 1989 and There Will Be Blood in 2007.Steven Spielberg put his mastery directing skills to work in this future classic, he also produced the movie. This movie shows the final moments of Abe Lincoln in office as the president of the United States. At that time the country was at war and at the very edge of change, Lincoln was in the driving sit against all oppositions to end the war and bring an end to slavery. The movie also depicts the steps taken by Lincoln and his party to get others at their side so as to win the necessary votes needed to end slavery.I did enjoy Daniel's portrayal, his voice and also his movements. Spielberg didn't fail to add the aspect of Lincoln story telling into this movie, as we get to hear many of his stories as he used them to pass his message across.This movie is very great and wonderful, and I'm glad I got to see it. I'm not an American never had it in mind to be one, but the singular act by Lincoln abolished slavery and made it possible for the Negro race to be seen as equal, although years of more battles and more assassinations led to the freedom that we see today, down to the point that a Black Man is now the President of America and he even won a second term in office.For historical purposes, this movie did have its inaccuracies but not withstanding it is a nice documentary drama for those who want to know the battles that engaged when Lincoln was trying to end the war, from the battles at the war front, to the one at the senate and then not to mentions Lincoln's battle at home, here is a movie to see.Did I enjoy this movie? Yes I did, but if you are not into history nor documentary you may find this movie a bore; Lincoln is a critical and commercial successful movie and it is one for the record books that I am sure of.After seeing Silver Lining Playbook I believed that none could match up to what Bradley Cooper delivered, but this acting by Daniel Day-Lewis matches up to it and even surpasses it from my view, so my Oscar winner for Best Actor should be Day-Lewis.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

It's too bad that they couldn't appreciate inspiring art presented in a moving and powerful way before returning to 'Captain America' or 'Iron Man 4' or 'Batman vs. Superman 2.'

Goodbsorbim,"There is no question of the extraordinary portrayal of the title character by Daniel Day-Lewis. It is forceful, nuanced and absorbing. He is truly a great actor. The misgivings I have are the telling of the story, which kind of veers toward political correctness. Besides Mr. Day-Lewis, most of the other roles are underwritten. Tommy Lee Jones has shown himself to be time and again a wonderful actor, but he is not in this film enough for us to consider his role in the passing of the 13th Amendment. Sally Field, as Mary Todd Lincoln,barely needs to be in this. The film wants to please everyone, which is fine, but it reaches too far. It is at times way too much talk. However, watching Daniel Day-Louis is worth the price of admission. So, a little conflicted but recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Boring, dull and plodding but excellently acted","I know I'm in the minority but this film is very boring. The first hour drags on and on explaining the 13th Amendment and it could have been edited down to a 10 or 15 minute seen. It's a pondering movie. I'm not sure what the revelation is about Lincoln in this movie. He's portrayed as he always has been: a revolutionary leader, great mind, folksy and very political when need be. The most interesting part of the movie is his relationship with his wife played by Sally Field. When she comes on the scene at least we have some fire, drama and neuroses. The rest of the film is a good old boys club and quite frankly not very entertaining. You could argue, I guess, that the political content is the guts of the film but it's not presented in an interesting way. The acting is exceptional but I consider this film as disappointing as the MGM 1936 Crawford vehicle about Andrew Jackson directed by Clarence Brown: The Gorgeous Hussy. In that film as well there is an exceptional cast dragging their weight to make something interesting out of American History.

"Mind-numbingly pretentious, manipulative and boring garbage","Typical Spielberg garbage in the guise of ""history"". Two and a half ponderous, pretentious, stiflingly boring hours about a few weeks in the life of the most overrated president in history. If he hadn't been assassinated, he might be seen now as the wildly destructive crackpot-on-a-mission he really was - a 19th century George W Bush - instead of as the wise, easy-going, deeply compassionate but pragmatic martyr this silly movie makes him out to be.Because Lincoln refused to allow the southern states to secede, which they had the right to do under the constitution, nearly a million people were slaughtered and the economy was ruined. Although he won his war, the damage he caused the country still has not healed 150 years later. Anybody who believes that this is a united country has his head in the sand. The South is and always has been a separate society in every way and has NEVER fit with the North.Just look at a red-state/blue-state map! The United States is made up of two distinct nations: one from the southeast westward, then up to the Canadian border and a skip northwest to Alaska; the other in the northeast, the west coast and Hawaii. It's a natural, organic division that has been here as long as there have been European settlers, and no amount of brainwashing or sappy movie-making will EVER change it. This has NEVER been a united country; it will never BE a united country. It's like trying to force Ireland to stay in the United Kingdom: it doesn't work.We are TWO countries, not one. It was a bad marriage from the beginning. The South should have been allowed to leave peacefully 160 years ago, to effect an amicable divorce when amity was still possible. But Lincoln the zealot refused, and the mess he left is still tearing these unnaturally ""United"" States apart.Slavery obviously was a peripheral issue, because it's long gone but the problems remain. Left on its own, the South would have eliminated slavery eventually anyway, as has every other civilized nation on earth. All Lincoln did by ramming it down the South's throat was to destroy the country, enforcing a union that has never worked, from 1620 until now.Stupid movies like this just preach to the choir, reminding Lincoln-lovers why they love him so much and celebrating his stirring triumph over the bad old South, when a TRULY visionary leader would have let it go. The South might very well have WANTED to rejoin the union later, after it had learned for itself that slavery is unspeakably evil, but it never had that chance.Lincoln did his best to destroy the South, and although he won his war he failed to annihilate the enemy. So now we have the South using Lincoln's very own Republican Party to wreak their vengeance on the rest of the country. Thanks a lot, Abe.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
History Class,"Based on a book by history hustler Doris Kearns Goodwin, Steven Spielberg has offered a high production value account, limited to the final months of Lincoln's life. It is involving and detailed, although some historians have disputed some of the facts. It may work well for those who want history in a movie theatre, although history is not drama and drama is not history. So this documentation is, for the most part, informative, without being emotionally involving. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Lincoln in a way that seems accurate and Tony Kushner's screenplay shares some of Lincoln's wit and humor. But this is less of a film about history than, say, ""The Devil's Disciple"" (1959), based on a play by George Bernard Shaw, which, while being astute about late 18th century history, mocks the presentation of history as truth, with superb wit, verve, and intellectual gravity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Good? Yes. 12 nominations good? That's pushing it...,"Like most, I came into Lincoln hearing much praise and anticipated a quality film. I also had heard about its runtime and I expected a long ride, but I did not expect this long of a ride. To my surprise ""Lincoln"" is approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes, but watching it, it felt like 3 very long hours. Simply put, I do not think Spielberg had the proper pacing for this film. As the film starts, you get a sense of framework for its development, the problem is: when does it stop? As a result of focusing on one key issue I believe Spielberg leaves much underdevelopment...which doesn't balance well with what is seemingly an abrupt ending. In my mind DDL owes history books for much of his success. When I really think about it, does ""Lincoln"" really convey a message of our 16th president, or was the instinct to accept whatever morals he stood for? This, in my opinion, leaves me wanting more. Spielberg insists on using the same formula to send the film's message; time that could've been spent utilizing the talents of Sally Field, JGL, and others.

A near perfect adaptation of one of the most celebrated Presidents of the United States set in the backdrop of one of the deadliest civil wars.,"Steven Spielberg is a director who almost always never stays in the present and more so in recent times. Its either a historical drama/adventure, futuristic sci/fi fantasy or a mix and match of both. Even though he has ventured and succeeded immensely in a wide array of genres, he will always be best known for bringing some of the most imaginative creatures to life on the big screen. Daniel Day-Lewis is probably one of the greatest actors in the history of modern cinema whose powerhouse performances brought many interesting characters to life and etched them as a vivid memory for movie lovers across the world. A collaboration of these two in presenting one of the most important, remarkable and bloodiest times of American history is one that isn't to be missed.The American civil war is consuming people by thousands with no end in sight. Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis), the 16th President of the United States has just won a re-election and is positioning himself along with the Republican Party to pass the 13th Amendment which outlaws slavery which is again the primary basis for the raging war. Understanding that there will never be an opportunity to abolish slavery than the current moment - Lincoln, whips from Congress, lobbyists etc. race against time to get the votes while legally bordering on the means.Abraham Lincoln is visually known for his unique features - the beard, the hat, the mole, his height. When you see Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln, in a few minutes you start believing that it is Abraham Lincoln playing himself as the Daniel Day-Lewis we have seen outside the movies is no longer visible. The minimalist performance throughout and saving the histrionics for only when required works perfectly. However the same cannot be said about others, I trust the director Spielberg for this difference as he would have done enough research on their personality traits. Sally Field as Mary Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens are both vocally loud and melodramatic yet impactful. While James Spader plays an interesting and entertaining role as Bilbo and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is wasted as Robert Lincoln. Most scenes involve a large cast in the canvas, the experience of Steven Spielberg clearly shows in the details of how the extras and the background characters react to situations.The screenplay may not be innovative as it follows a linear approach but the complexity of letting the audience in on the bits of information which most already know is perfect to keep up the anticipation, interest and pace. Another aspect that standout is the beautiful production design - again minimalistic. While the backdrop is set on the raging civil war, there is no actual war sequence shown except for the aftermath in battlefields. The period settings look very realistic that includes makeup, costumes, buildings and city view - but not something we are seeing for the first time especially from Mr. Spielberg. Even the color tone of the movie looks authentic but one may not feel drawn to the movie just by the appearance. The background score stays in the background and is impactful when required. Kennedy and Lincoln, though celebrated for their time in the highest office - are even more known for their assassinations and conspiracies surrounding them. While this movie doesn't indulge much into the assassination of the protagonist, how they showed it is innovative.A near perfect adaptation of one of the most celebrated Presidents of the United States set in the backdrop of one of the deadliest civil wars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
admirable   work,"one of films who impress for the precise use of details. because it propose not exactly a portrait of Lincoln but a way to discover him behind the hero or statue's image. and the chance of meeting between a great actor and an important director is the key for success of a film who brooks limits, remains cold, direct and touching, remake a national symbol and gives to it emotions, vulnerability, force and a wise manner to define the future as expression of high faith. a challenge - film. not real comfortable for the viewer but useful for understand the spirit of a period, the war of a man looking the right way for build a country from ashes. for many films, the story is the basic axis. in the case of Lincoln, the embroidery of performances is the most important ingredient. because the story seems be well known. because each of us has his image about Abraham Lincoln and the expectation to discover it on the screen.

Lincoln,"Spielberg's Lincoln was a moving portrayal of the president's force of will and belief.

In my opinion, the integral and most defining aspect of this film is the script. To some, the pace may feel drawn out.

Dialogue heavy.,"This is a beautiful looking film with excellent acting and for that at least it can not be faulted. However after sitting through the film in the cinema and then realising that the time seemed to drag, I have to criticise this film. The problem I found, was that the script was far too dialogue heavy, I was left wanting to be shown a story and instead having it explained to me in lengthy debates taking place in 2 or 3 rooms. We never really get shown what Lincoln is fighting for, this is only really hinted to us through dialogue and the rare few shots. I would have like this to have been more of a visual story and I feel that this was something that was highly lacking because the majority of the film takes part in a few sets and we never explore the world outside. I understand that this was a political biopic so of course there is going to be a fair amount of dialogue, however for me it was too much. This left me feeling detached from the overall narrative and although I thought the acting was superb, there was too much explaining in places where I wanted to be shown.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Lincoln vs. Slaves- WHO ENDED SLAVERY?,"After watching Lincoln and learning about slaves back then, I believe that it is pretty safe to say that both Abraham Lincoln and the slaves had a role in freeing slaves. The act of freeing slaves didn't take a couple days, weeks, or months...it took a couple years and those years, were rough years. In 1865, the 13th amendment to the United States Constitution read "" neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as punishment for the crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted; or any place subject to jurisdiction. Lincoln was able to pass the Emancipation Proclamation which said ""that all persons held slaves are, and henceforward will be free"". This aided in freeing slaves, but the slaves were able to escape their masters and go into the military to fight for freedom. Although many people believed that Lincoln freed the slaves, but you also have to look at it from the slaves' point of view and how they were able to overcome slavery with the help of Lincoln. So, I say that this movie did serve justice in saying that Lincoln freed the slaves, but I wish that they went more in depth as to what the slaves did to overcome slavery.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Really Good, Just a lot of Dialogue!","I have looked through what others have thought of this movie. They all call it boring because there is a ton of dialogue. I don't mind that as much as others. Trust me, I would have loved to have seen more battle scenes or action scenes. But, that is not what the movie is about. The movie is not the tale of Lincoln's life or a biography. This is a story of his battle to get the 13th amendment ratified. This movie shows his struggle of getting the house of representatives to vote yea for the amendment and how the strong democratic opposition hindered that for a while. I really loved the way Day-Lewis portrayed Lincoln. He acted the way I thought Lincoln would sound and act. The music really added to the mood and the scenes were really detailed. My one complaint is that there was way more dialogue than I expected. Also, they should have named this movie differently because the subject of it is not portrayed well by the title.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Eye opening,This movie just shows how the war really made the black community free physically and how Lincoln helped by passing the 13th Amendment as well as the proclamation that would further push the 13 amendment to come into place and take affirmative action.

A very believable and ambitious drama mega production,"Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is one of the best if not the best drama production I've seen. From every good-looking set to the custom design, a huge cast and musical score and a beautifully crafted script it is without a doubt a very well-rounded picture, acting is solid through and through making it a very believable picture and since this is a historical film, I can safely say Spielberg did a great job. It may not be loaded with spectacular action scenes or exciting romance, but this drama has a particular tone of solemnity and heroism that actually kept me very interested and woke many emotions in me, I am left with no other choice but to rate this a 10-star production.

Not worth a penny...,"It's bad enough that this movie is such a deadly bore but it is also misleading. I suggest people educate themselves about the real Abraham Lincoln. He was not as this movie portrays him. The movie does, interestingly, mention a few of the tyrannical actions committed by Lincoln, but these go unremarked upon (and uncontested) for the rest of the movie.Daniel Day-Lewis does a top-notch job but I feel compelled to point out that this is my least favorite role of his. I'm disappointed that he chose to come out of semi-retirement to play it.

If you like Ken Burns you'll love Lincoln - Belongs on PBS......,"A factoid crammed documentary disguised as a movie for getting votes on the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. No excitement here pure TV stuff. This looks like a blatant attempt to secure another Oscar for Spielberg (How many to date? 768?)and/or Lewis. Also, Spielberg and company missed a great opportunity to show how the civil war was made to go on for years grinding up the lives of 600,000 youth so the Unions Military Industrial Complex could make billions of dollars off the dead and wounded.

Day Lewis carries lumbering Lincoln,"As he did in There will be Blood the art of Daniel Day Lewis simply overwhelms intriguing plot, solid production values and the lumbering direction of Steven Spielberg in Lincoln. Summoning his inner Henry Fonda Lewis once again proves with authority that he is the finest English speaking actor working in film.Lincoln concentrates on the final year of the war and the political struggle to end slavery in the Senate. Now just as then politics can be very surly and Spielberg does not spare Honest Abe when considering the stakes and he consents to whatever means possible.Spielberg's direction is deliberate and stodgy with beautifully lit compositions that hang around too long. He also stumbles with his jarring attempt to bring a comic relief to the sober theme regarding a trio of shifty con men displaying too much stooge slapstick working in concert with Lincoln's cabinet.Sally Field's Mrs.Lincoln does not hold its own with Lewis because no one's performance this year and most others don't but she does supply a fair share of powerful moments. Spielberg gets competent performances from the rest of his cast save Spader's manic hipster con man but with all the performances as well as director Spielberg's meandering pace you will hardly notice since Daniel Day Lewis has your complete attention from start to finish.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The acting goes to another level. He took a pure drama and brought in some of the greatest actors of the era and got some of the best performances of their careers for Lincoln.Bravo.,9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A small great film,"It's an enjoyable movie. But it stays at that.Now I am putting down these words with immense fear. Rarely do I walk out of a widely-acclaimed film unsatisfied. Most of time, I find the critics' praises and the moviegoers' lauds very reasonable. When it happens that I don't, I always question myself: ""Did I miss something?""And I've been asking myself that over and over after Lincoln. I've read reviews. And my conclusion and perception has not changed. It's an incredible film, and an unbelievably small film.Lincoln had the look of a truly grandeur historic piece. With an incredible cast led by Daniel Day Lewis in front of the camera, and an all the more fantastic crew behind with Spielberg at its head, Lincoln, from its birth, seems destined to become not only a film about history, but also a film that will stay in history and become a part of history.But it hasn't. Despite Daniel Day Lewis' brilliant portrayal, Lincoln isn't a deep look into a great man's life; the story lacks the necessary complexity. It may be an effort at completely accurately recreate history, but that's left for historians to decide.It isn't a pensive and analytical look at politics either. Some will say that it is, and that Lincoln has presented the dilemma a great politician faces: should one do the little evil for the greater good? President Lincoln, as portrayed here, has tried all means possible to pull votes onto his amendment, aka, the right thing. Some will say that this is Spielberg's message, that when facing such dilemma, just go for the frigging greater good.I find that hard to believe. At least, if that were his intention, it was not very well conveyed. Those segments - when Lincoln was pulling votes, that is - were presented in such a playful tone (with such playful tune by John Williams) that I cannot draw any serious thinking out of it. According the film, it is all but a game. The ending vote segment especially. Yes, yes, it was all very moving and full of tension when each vote was counted and the amendment was finally past.'Tis all a game, where one (or a couple) man's diligence, discretion, and intelligence rightfully trampled over other noble politicians' laziness, carelessness, ruthlessness, and stupidity. 'Tis all a game, where the fate of the people hangs in the hands of our not-so-decorous politicians. Where are the people, by the way, in this historic film (except for the beginning)?To be fair, Lincoln has its great filmmaking. The one thing that has lingered in my mind is its breathtaking visual presentation. Every scene is so well lit and framed that sometimes I find myself wondering if I am watching a Aleksandr-Sokurov-directed film, or a Gordon-Willis-shot film. But of course not; it's Spielberg and Kaminski's great works. Equally brilliant are the art direction and John Williams music.Sadly, despite both the cast and the crew's efforts in achieving the film's amazing looks and feels, the story just isn't right. It was fascinating in the watching, but once I started thinking about it, its magic stopped. It's a great small movie only for entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Lincoln shot in back again, this time by Spielburg","Lincoln the person and President stands for and was an example of honesty and diligent open effort to move forward justice and equality in this country at a difficult and dangerous time in our history. He won the presidency, won the civil war and did more for freedom and fairness as any man who has lived in America.Watching this movie instead focuses most of its energy on largely unsubstantiated assertions that in order to pass the 13th amendment Lincoln bribed, paid off and lied to various politicians. And assertions that Lincoln bent or broke the law and what was right in the name of a good cause. While no man is perfect and Lincoln may have had faults a movie focusing on shady and disingenuous acts is unfair to Lincoln and to America and reads more like a political statement or propaganda piece. The movie insults the audience's intelligence not only by portraying some dubious gossip as though it is irrefutable fact but also by suggesting Lincoln actually was good ""because he lied and bribed and deceived people.The movie is further flawed by similar attacks on other characters that are without foundation and seem targeted to smear people trying to accomplish a good work. An example is a congressman fighting for passage of the 13th amendment goes home after the success and is shown in bed with his black house keeper? --No explanation no foundation just oh yea and we want you to know this anti slavery guy is sleeping with his house keeper?I understand that Hollywood is left leaning and am usually willing to put up with a little slanting for a well told story. In this case the slanting is insane and the story isn't even very well told. There is also a fair amount of ""disfuntional family discussions"" portrayed between Lincoln and his wife and son which seem pointless and designed to just expose dirty laundry which when done for someone who lived that long ago tends to be 90% made up rubbish, and 10% latest Hollywood stupidity.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The war has already begun at the time the movie begins and the plot jumps right into Lincoln's decision to push for the passing of the 13th Amendment. The movie then shifts to focus on the difficulty Lincoln faces within his own Cabinet as well as with certain members of Congress as he works with some humorous men to gain the support of some congressmen who may be on the edge regarding the amendment. Lincoln is constantly faced with the question of whether he should aim to abolish slavery or if ending the war should be the primary goal. Also, throughout the movie the struggles that families face, including Lincoln's, are shown vividly through the sadness and grief various characters, like Lincoln's wife, show. This movie tugs at the heart-strings as brave men fight for what they believe needs to be done in Congress as well as on the battlefields.",,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

The end of slavery,"I think the movie Lincoln accurately represents the end of slavery, as far as the events that took place during the Civil war. In the movie, Lincoln took many steps to end the horrors of slavery through his presidential seat, but the slaves involved also helped their own cause tremendously. President Lincoln throughout his terms fought the Civil war and the war against slavery, through politics and determination he pushed congress and the house of Representatives to vote for the passing of abolishment of slavery. It took much convincing of the Democratic party and many tricks from Lincolns closest circle to convince some of them to vote for the abolishment of slavery. Many were slow to pick the side of abolishment because they were unaware and afraid of what would come of slaves now being freed, but they soon saw the way of Lincoln, and knew that if they wanted the war to end then ending slavery would be the best way to do that. For if slavery was ended the south would collapse because it depends so much on slavery. The slaves fought submission resiliantly and they came to the votings and voiced their opinions, that's how the slaves helped their own cause of ending abolishment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

"Visually perfect, ""Lincoln"" is calm and without sequences that could be remarkable are softened. An excellent and magnificent production without personality and emotion","It was a longtime dream of Steven Spielberg to direct a biopic of US President Abraham Lincoln. Also in 2001, Dreamworks (a studio founded by Spielberg) acquired the rights to the book Team of Rivals: The Genius of Abraham Lincoln, base material for Lincoln's screenplay. However, due to production problems, the dropout of contracted actors, dissatisfaction with the screenwriters and the director's busy schedule, the film was only released in 2012, more than a decade after the book's rights were purchased. ""Lincoln"" is a film that should work very well for Americans. The figure of Lincoln not only appears on every five-dollar bill, but is also a fundamental part of teaching in schools; which would make identification with the feature much greater. In countries outside the US, this issue is partially resolved with the insertion of signs (and even a map!) that help to contextualize the period that gives rise to the plot.But what doesn't help at all is Kushner's script, which makes sure to thoroughly analyze every detail and action that made passage of the Thirteenth Amendment possible. For most, the political side doesn't matter as much as Lincoln's relationship with his family - which is remarkably different with each member - and unfortunately for me, an overwhelming portion of the film is devoted to discussions at the White House table and fights in Congress ( the latter, the most interesting thanks to some good catchphrases). But even if we don't learn much about the Lincoln Man, Daniel Day-Lewis is there to make every frame of his appearance count. Having the benefit of an efficient make-up that transforms him into a double of the former president, the actor elaborates a whole physical and vocal construction for the performance; ranging from the limp and sloping posture to the soft and fragile voice - a characteristic that reflects Lincoln's exhaustion during the years in office. Lewis has a monstrous presence - and will certainly secure another Oscar for his impeccable performance - but there is room for the supporting actors to shine. In particular, Tommy Lee Jones's Thaddeus Stevens, a figure he fills with his usual seriousness and a welcome tone of sarcasm (which overflows in the scene in which he separates the syllables of the word ""republican""). As the Republican radical, Jones hits the tone (sometimes comedic, sometimes dramatic) and helps the story to leave the protagonist's surroundings and delve into the Chamber. The out come of its plot is particular moving.It is also worth praising the performances of David Strathairn, as Secretary of State William Seward, and James Spader, as W. N. Bilbo, a man hired to secretly convince some Democrats against the Amendment, serving as a great comic relief. The cast also features recognized names in American dramaturgy, such as John Hawkes, Hal Holbrook, Jack Earle Haley and Michael Stuhlbarg, all in great work. The only one who disagrees with the performance of her colleagues is Sally Field, extremely strident as the first lady of the USA and one of the few women in the plot. And if women have few spaces left, the same can be said of blacks. Remaining in the political sphere, the film is little concerned with the target audience of the Thirteenth Amendment. ""Lincoln"" is not a social film. It is an atypical Spielberg project, with few external scenes, almost controlled Manichaeism, abundant dialogues and difficult to understand for the less attentive. The script makes the serious mistake of reducing the role of blacks to mere spectators, hoping that whites will vote in their favor. In addition, the soldiers' history, which could actively highlight blacks, is barely explored. By the way, this does not only harm the black characters, but also anyone from the war core. See, for example, how Lincoln's son falls short of history from the moment he enlists in the army.We should also point out that the excessive focus on building the protagonist takes space away from other characters with immense potential, such as Mary Todd, built by Sally Field with admirable effort, but who seems to exist only to provide dramatic moments for Lincoln. Speaking of which, the entire family plot is poorly developed, serving only as a mere historical record, being a real waste, since it could create layers in the title character. Fortunately, the political plot is very well developed. The script does not hide the corruption that took place to buy votes, despite representing it as something acceptable for the president's objectives, in yet another discarded chance to insert duality in Lincoln. However, the game of influence between the congressmen is precisely punctuated, it is clear why each politician presented chose his vote and it is a beautiful exercise to analyze the strategies adopted by each party. It is precisely in this part of the story that Tommy Lee Jones stands out, showing how fervent Thaddeus Stevens was and his resistance to having to hide opinions to help pass the amendment.""Lincoln"" is not a biographical film about the life story of the sixteenth American president. The object is the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution and the consequent end of slavery. The Civil War only serves to contextualize the dark period the country is experiencing and influence the choices of deputies on the subject. There are few scenes of battles and deaths, of the nearly 1 million that took place between 1861 and 1865. We are facing an eminent political film, in which ideas overlap facts, in which emotion loses some space to reason, to beliefs and political ""fights and rivalries"". The greatest success of Kushner's script is to show in great detail how a controversial project reaches acceptance by several opposition parliamentarians in a matter of days.Despite still being affected by an innocence in which private interests are little involved, the plot praises the maneuvers of the president and his entire team to convince non-allies, either through promises of positions in the Government or simple ideological arguments. , or mainly due to the omission of essential information about the course of the war. It is curious that, when we draw a parallel with the present day, in which the Democratic party (left) practically appropriated themes such as the fight against racism, they were the greatest opponents of the Thirteenth Amendment, emitting all the prejudices that today accuse Republican rivals. It's the old ""Accuse them what you do, call them what you are"" tactic. Even today, for a left that is so proud of being the bearer of all the virtues of humanity, it must be sad to have to admit that the abolition of slavery had a Republican president at its head.There is nothing romantic about this process. It is, above all, business in which everyone seeks to gain or defend the position and authority of their respective party. And Kushner displays all of this through dialogue upon dialogue. At certain times, the impression is that we are not even watching a Spielberg film, see the tireless chatter in most scenes. The filmmaker, however, takes advantage of the various moments of eloquence in the screenwriter's text to put his exaltations and emotions into practice, giving the film a small and well-managed heart, however much John Williams' exaggerated score works against it. And these moments happen, mainly, when we have the protagonist on the scene. Making room for the Lincoln father of the family, who is more affectionate with the youngest son than with the oldest and maintains a turbulent relationship with his wife, Kushner, however, rightly gives the Lincoln president and leader of the Republicans more attention. This is a man whose dignity and oratory are his great qualities. However, sometimes the text bumps into the myth that surrounds Lincoln, which the beautiful photograph by Janusz Kaminski makes a point of highlighting. It seems afraid of showing some character flaw in the recently re-elected president. Even his dubious political strategies are innocent with moral lessons, many of them arising from very well told stories.Spielberg still wants to save the world, as he has demonstrated so many times before. In his hands is a figure that, by itself, reflects all of his main concerns as a director. However, he lacked more courage in facing her and less reverence in approaching her. The man we see in Lincoln is almost a superhero, far from the human being we could identify with, albeit in certain ways. There are so many dialogues, deals and political moves, that at some point one has the impression of exaggeration, that all these details would not have been necessary to convey the fundamental idea, that is, that even in the face of so many barbarities, the capacity for change is innate to man and that it is always worth fighting for. After recognizing English historical figures (The King's Speech, 2010), Scottish (Braveheart, 1995), German (Schindler's List himself), Chinese (The Last Emperor, 1987), Austrian (Amadeus, 1984) or Indian (Gandhi, 1982), perhaps the time has indeed come for an American icon to receive this honor. Not that the film itself deserves it, but it won't be any nonsense either.""Lincoln"" is about that old American patriotism, about how the ""good white men"" fought valiantly for the freedom of black people. It's also Steven Spielberg's old desire to bring the life of Abraham Lincoln to the screen. In fact, he did, but his work will probably soon be forgotten, there is nothing about this feature that remains in the memory, a great moment or a great scene, it just happens, without the involvement of the audience. The truth is that this film lacked Spielberg, his old exaggerations seem to be missing here, everything is so calm and without sequences that could be remarkable are softened. An excellent and magnificent production of a film without personality, without emotion.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Spielberg Knows Exactly What He Wants to Display,"There are some weird reviews of the movie that I come across every now and then claiming that the movie actually portrays Lincoln as a saint and it would be better to present him with his mistakes and such. These sights are clearly presented with claims disproving themselves with that kind of perspective as Spielberg tries to demonstrate the exact opposite of that view. It may not be the best effort, but it is, in sharp contrast with this kind of reviews, an effort to portray a man, rather than a saint or a hero without a humane presentation.By portraying such a man, Spielberg takes a great risk of course. But, he does it with the only way that a director should lay his endeavors, he presents a small part of a grand narrative. That is the key to the movie. People complain about the movie's title or the presentation of a short period of Lincoln's lifetime, they have no idea about cinema in my opinion. Recently, I have watched one of the adaptations of ""Germinal"" by Emile Zola, such a grand narrative for me. Claude Berri tried to adapt the novel in that 1993 version. That was one of the worst adaptations I think, just because of the movie's incomprehensible endeavor to recapitulate the whole novel in nearly three hours. The only thing that could be recollected from the movie as a good feature was its language, which was French. If, by any chance, Claude Berri tried to recapture the last part of the novel, last ten days, even ten hours of three main characters of the novel when they are stuck in the mine after the accident, it might well be a nicely presented exhibition without the haste and tumultuousness of a very long novel narration in three hours which seemed to lose the influence of the story stored in a format that which we call a book, a novel. Why I gave that example, just to remind people that grand narratives equal grand lifetimes or biographies and Spielberg knows it. He also knows that 13th Amendment was the most important point to depict on screen about Abraham Lincoln. Some other director may think that it was not, it was some other thing from his earlier times worth to demonstrate, and that director may create a great demonstration as well, it is not my point. The point is that a director should capture a moment, a thing to present from a narrative rather than recapitulating all of it, and Spielberg does that.Other comments about Lincoln's stance against slavery, if it was fake or not what we see in the movie, are also centered around certain pieces of information about Lincoln's ideas, from some letters or deduced from political actions; however, they miss the point. Lincoln's notions are altering throughout the time just like all of the United States, he does not take a stance like an absolute abolitionist but one cannot claim that he does not actually care about slavery, he only uses that subject for his war policies. That is, to put it mildly, narrow-mindedness. Lincoln, as Eric Foner puts it, is part of a spectrum of thinking on slavery in that era believing that it would be a long process to get rid of slavery, but step by step he is, in some sense, evolving. Spielberg tries to portray that transition or evolution period with vague dialogues of Lincoln, he never takes a strong stance like Thaddeus Stevens, but it is a rather discursive evolution of a person with attitudes of a mediocre development.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Wonderful, informative film with good production and acting","Firstly, I'd like to say that the film is not centered around Lincoln's life, as I expected, but more on him and his administration's role in the passing of the 13th amendment. Which doesn't necessarily make it bad! It just caught me off guard.
 I really did enjoy this film, even though it is not really along the lines of movies that I usually watch. Apart from great content to work from, I thought this movie did a very good job connecting the audience to the characters. It's also very difficult to build the suspense needed in a drama film when the audience already knows what happened in history, and I think the team behind this film did do that very well. I also really enjoyed how they presented the duality of the amendment at every level - for instance, how the Lincolns were divided on the passage of the bill, but presented a united front. This was mimicked in the cabinet and in the house. It shows a more nuanced view of an issue that is usually portrayed as one-sided, whole-heartedly and unitedly supported by the North. Although I sincerely hope that our government actually functions more cohesively than they are portrayed here, this film does create a good sense of the disunity among Republicans and ardent opposition by the Democrats in Congress.
 One critique that I would really like to focus on (and this is a more personal preference than anything) is that this movie focuses Lincoln the ideal more than Lincoln the man. With few exceptions, this film depicted Lincoln as poised, rational, and morally just at all times. There was no mention of his infamous letter to Horace Greeley in which he claimed, ""If I could save the Union without freeing any slaves, I would do it."" It also sort of shows Abraham Lincoln as some sort of mighty rock that stood his ground alone against the masses that called for peace at the price of abolition. While this is true to a degree, this movie doesn't really give credit to the century of foundation that abolitionists had already laid for Lincoln to stand and succeed on. Even the few scenes in which Lincoln loses control of his emotions, it is excused as reasonable and unavoidable. This is a pretty typical thing - we tend to portray Lincoln as an epitome of virtue. At the same time, I understand that in a film, character and effect is often more important than strict historical accuracy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln,"As a history buff and Lincoln fan, I love this movie. Daniel Day Lewis is a master of his craft, and we'll probably never get a truer on-screen representation of Abraham Lincoln as a man. It's difficult reconciling any larger-than-life historical figure to who they were as a person, but this movie does a fine job. Lincoln's charm, wit, and mastery of language are on display during a small window of his life, and what we see helps to understand the man who wrote the Gettysburg address and Second inaugural and kept the union intact through the most trying period in American history.

"Kudos  to Doris Goodwin & Daniel Day-Lewis, But...","Without question, Doris Kearns Goodwin is THE historical writer of our times. Her depiction of what Abraham Lincoln had to endure -- not to mention what the hundreds of thousands of men on both sides of the Civil War had to suffer -- whilst he made the agonizing decision of whether to end the war early (and forever keep ""Negroes"" enslaved by those in the Confederacy) versus ""cajoling"" those in his Cabinet to secure the necessary votes to ban slavery was extraordinary.With regard to the ""But..."" in the title of my posting, following are the problems I had with this film, which, admittedly, will surely add to Day-Lewis' Best-Actor Oscar collection:o This is the first English-speaking film to NEED SUBTITLES. The use of English in Lincoln's day was, of course, very much different than it is today. I found myself trying to follow/understand/comprehend what was being spoken at the moment as much as I was attempting to follow the story line.o The choice of Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln was simply a poor choice. As I was following the interactions between Day-Lewis and Field I found it difficult to reconcile the actual difference (11 years) in their real-life ages.o Tommy Lee Jones was perhaps the most miscast character for my taste. He just didn't convince me that he was a man of the times. Perhaps I have Mr. Jones just too connected to the ""Men In Black,"" ""Fugitive,"" and ""U.S. Marshalls"" movies.Basically, a good movie...with issues.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Sad Spielberg Disappointment,"Great production values, wonderful sets and costuming. Dreadful boring script and ponderous direction. Daniel Day Lewis superb as was all of the cast, but they could not make up for the script and direction. A sad disappointment. Didn't anyone notice that the plot line was ponderous with little or no action scene after scene? Didn't anyone notice that the dialog sounded like quotes from a textbook? Didn't anyone notice that YOU COULD NOT IDENTIFY anyone as a primary historical figure unless you majored in 1860 to 1866 in your history studies?

"A treatment for insomnia?  Should be called ""Amendment 13,"" not ""Lincoln""","Stephen Spielberg is a victim of his previous successes in many ways. When a movie comes out emblazoned with his name, whether it is as producer or director, expectations mount. Viewers may go in expecting a transformative cinematic experience.As he's older and more powerful in Hollywood, he also has more time for pet projects, and since press about this movie states that he has been working on it for years, it qualifies as a pet project. Unfortunately, with his current penchant for pet projects, he seems to have forgotten what brought him greatness in his earlier years: making movies that large numbers of people like, want, and enjoy seeing.People who are students of American History, particularly the second half of the nineteenth century will be enthralled by the scores of political figures brought to life. They will marvel at the speeches and machinations of the House of Congress, as the jockeying to get Amendment 13 passed takes place.But, to some of us, watching a bunch of guys in weird beards and weirder clothes posture to each other in big flowery speeches like it was some endless loop of vintage 1860's CSPAN, well it ain't our cup of tea. Several times throughout the beginning of the movie, he introduced scenes with subtitles beneath some of the characters, to let the viewing audience know who they are looking at. So, at some level he knew lots of people would be watching, scratching their heads and saying ""huh?"" ""Lincoln"" received a ""four"" from me because the art direction, cinematography, costuming and makeup are all first rate. But of course, one could say the same thing regarding the latest Tim Burton vanityfest.The title ""Lincoln"" and the advance press buzz that it's a biopic would lead one to believe that maybe there would be scenes of actual slavery, to put into context what the men were arguing over. Or how about a little more background about Mary? Would it have hurt so much to flash back to Willie's death so we can see how it shaped her? Of course, I'm not a master movie maker or even a great novelist. But I know when something entertains me and when it doesn't.

Brilliant,"There's not much more I can add that hasn't already been said, but alas, I was so blown-away I had to try...Daniel Day-Lewis is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both ""Super 8"" and ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" and directed both ""The Adventures of Tintin"" and ""War Horse,"" two highly acclaimed pictures.Spielberg calls the shots in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time.Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most memorable roles yet. He seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes.One requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A time in history well worth recalling and remembering,"Here is a time in history that's well worth recalling and remembering. Steven Spielberg's Lincoln focuses on the final months of the great president's life, when he worked with rivals and supporters in government to pass the 13th constitutional amendment -- that's the one that emancipates the slaves. It's a handsome well-mounted production, with the drab look reflective of the period. Once again, Spielberg extracts superb performances from his mostly celebrated cast. Daniel Day-Lewis portrays the beleaguered president as a dignified and at the same time, very human, figure. However, my favorite character was Tad Lincoln played by the young Gulliver McGrath; amid all the (necessary) conniving and manipulation taking place in the capital city, he comes across as so innocent and carefree... until the tragic moment at the end. See this movie as a lesson on how clever political maneuvering by the wily president enabled the successful passage of a controversial bill.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A great movie to see Abraham Lincoln on screen.,"Lincoln is a motion picture directed by Steven Spielberg. Due to titled in the name of one of the greatest president of United States and direction tag of Steven Spielberg, it was one of the highly anticipated movies coming this year. This movie is not actually a biopic; it presents the part of the life of Former president of US Abraham Lincoln at the time of the civil war. It was a hard time as a president for Lincoln we all know this, but this film completely shows his mental strength to take tough decisions which was going to change the future of nation. History of Lincoln as we all know is not the main interest which was highlighted by the director but he was trying to convey the message of Lincoln to the audience. Why the president was so eager to abolish the slavery? What was in his mind when he has to choose between end the war or pass the 13th amendment?This movie is a masterpiece of Steven Spielberg. By this movie he has proved once again that he can not only create history by making movies which make deep impression on its audiences mind but he can also rewrite history from the page to big screen by making every character and every scene so alive that audience can live that time. A great part in success of this movie is the hand of Tony Kushner in screenplay. Role of Lincoln is played by two times Academy winner Daniel-day Lewis who has done splendid work to make us realize that how great personality the president had. He played the role with complete justice to the character. John Williams has done some good work in music department.MY RATING – 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln,"Lincoln, is a film that works on several different levels much to my delight. As a film about a famous historical figure, a drama and an involving character study as well. Because most people will have probably learned about Abraham Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation in history class and many other details about Lincoln, some of this story will seem familiar because of facts we have learned over the years from textbooks and grade school and high school classes. However the film offers a lot more about Lincoln, that I had ever contemplated, or basically knew before going into the film. The film basically does focus on Lincoln, as he is in his second term as president and the civil wars has been going on for a couple of years now. Henceforth the decision to abolish slavery and put an end to the civil war. Historically, I do not know all the little minor details and things that some historians, may, or may not have a problem with. Being a Canadian, I only know so much American history and I felt that I walked away from this film having learned more and appreciated more than I did going in. Whether this was because the film was carefully researched and displayed the facts and evidence carefully, or because it was a well put together and powerful film, or perhaps both that satisfied both my film critique of the film, but also gave me food for thought and helped fill in some of the background of American history that I had only ever had a basic concept of before. Having said that let me share with you some of the things that I did not know about and thought the film tenderly and affectionately brought to the screen. Abraham Lincoln, is seen here not as an overly complex, or difficult character to figure out, but I really liked that about the film. He is seen as a calm and soft spoken man who generally seems to care and have empathy and compassion for those around him. He seems to be slow to anger even though he does have occasional moments of anger and frustration trying to get this bill passed. We see that he loves his wife, but there is some distance between them, perhaps even lost love over an event that we learn in the film has grieved both of their hearts and unfortunately maybe had an affect on their marriage and feelings about one another as well. Then we have quiet scenes where we see Lincoln, playing with his young son and just the respect and love they have for each other. Those scenes I found particularly heartfelt and beautiful. The film does portray Lincoln, in an honored and respected view and going by the film I can completely see why they did that. Here is a man who is president of one of the largest and most powerful countries in the world. He has a lot of responsibility, a lot he has to get done and probably a lot of stress and pressure to deal with. However, he does not brush off his family, or have an arrogance to him, or even a sense of entitlement, or prestige that he thinks he is better than others. He seems to identify with the common man and woman of that time and we see that in the way he talks, behaves and perhaps how he is governing the country. I marveled at Daniel Day Lewis's brilliant performance of the president. It is not just a great performance because he looks and sounds like him. There is so much more to it than that. Just his posture and his soft voice and the fact that he can become so passionate about something and almost be in a rage and then the moments where he is laughing over an amusing story, or anecdote to where he quietly and lovingly plays with his youngest son. There is so much range, depth and emotion in this performance and Lewis makes us believe he is this man and he makes us have respect and love for him not just because he is a good man, but because he makes him believable and relatable. The supporting performances I all really enjoyed as well, particularly Tommy Lee Jones's performance also. The film looks authentic and though it is a slower paced film, I felt it captures the audience's attention because of the performances, the detail to authenticity and because of a story that is filled with engrossing and captivating characters and events and sometimes some great humorous scenes as well. I loved knowing more about Lincoln, both with his presidency and the legacy of his work, but also really appreciated getting to know him with the people that surround him, whether it be his family, co-workers, or people who have, or maybe even didn't vote for him as well. A powerful and affectionate portrayal that is not forced or sappy and emotional, but allows us to care because of these real people whose lives we can identify with before us and the passion and technique that went to bringing it to the screen.

Historical snapshot on a US political giant,"I'll say from the off that I have a fair knowledge of Lincoln, having read much on him and seen numerous respectable documentaries on the great man. One thing you learn fast from all that is that the truth is a lot more complicated and not as rosy tinted as the legend has it made out to be.So it's thankful that Spielberg chose to avoid the hagiography and concentrated on a pivotal moment in his political career, the repeal of the thirteenth amendment which would emancipate the slaves in his country.The whole strength of this film lies in its story, but sadly as a film it kind of drops a level. It can get quite dull and confusing, which is a shame as it is trying to say many good things. It is a very long film, and the attention to detail is wonderful but it does drag.Notably, there were few black characters in this film (mostly minor supporting). This was possibly on purpose as it was a establishment battle and the establishment was wholly white. Nevertheless, would have been greater if we had seen more of a black person's perspective here, and in that sense it kind of dropped the film.This film is beautifully shot and avoids any unnecessary action sequences just to prop up the film. It's easily Spielberg's finest for many a year.Must add about the cast of actors. This film has probably the best cast list for a film in many a year, and possibly one of the best ensembles I've seen in any movies.

Spielberg On Honest Abe,"Given the difficulties of America in the 21st century, it is oftentimes difficult to remember that America has faced much more challenging and much more tragic circumstances throughout its history. The biggest challenge America ever faced was not a war for freedom in some faraway part of the world, but a war for freedom on its own soil. The Civil War, in which Southern states split off from the rest of the Union over the issue of whether African-Americans should remain enslaved, tore America apart between 1861 and 1865; and only one man was able to settle the issue. That man was Abraham Lincoln, our nation's 16th president. The last three months of Lincoln's life, in which he managed to accomplish so much only to have it end in his assassination, is what is detailed in LINCOLN, director Steven Spielberg's impassioned and highly involved American epic.Stepping into the shoes of ""Honest Abe"" is English actor Daniel Day-Lewis, who essays a Lincoln not as we thought we knew him, with a stentorian manner of speaking, but a high, reedy-voiced man reflecting his origins in Kentucky and Illinois whose word nevertheless carried considerable gravitas, even as he presided over the messiest conflict America would ever see. Not only does Day-Lewis preside over the immense task, after having won a second term in office, of trying to end that conflict, but also to resolve once and for all the issue of slavery by the ratification of the 13th Amendment to the Constitution. Making things worse for Day-Lewis, even members of his own cabinet, including Secretary of State William Seward (David Strathairn), are torn on the issue of compromise with ending the Civil War and passing the amendment with the required two-thirds majority needed in the House of Representatives. The task for Lincoln thus falls in no small measure on two prominent Northern politicians, Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook) and Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), to not only keep his Republican majority in line, but also to cause twenty Democrats to defect from the hard line of keeping slavery in place, come hell or high water. The debate in the House, particularly with Jones commanding so much attention, is as bitter and rancorous as any we've seen in our modern era; and the final vote is 119-56 (with eight abstentions, it is just enough to allow the 13th Amendment to pass). In the end, Day-Lewis visits many of the Civil War battle sites and reflects, in the days before his violent demise, the cost of war and the battle of ideals.Spielberg had handled great American historical issues and eras before in such films as THE COLOR PURPLE, AMISTAD, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but LINCOLN was clearly a personal obsession for him; indeed, this project was twelve years in the making. And while he may not have been that much of a history buff either in grade school, high school, or while briefly a student at Long Beach State in the late 1960s, he nevertheless developed a taste for it throughout his career. The impact of the Holocaust as shown in SCHINDLER'S LIST is what almost certainly fired his imagination, to understand the why of that tragedy; and in LINCOLN, he does very much the same thing, in illustrating why Lincoln was so important to America, not only of his time, but of all time, leading up to the 2008 election of our nation's first African-American president. And here, he allows Day-Lewis to give a portrait of Lincoln that rates right up there with Henry Fonda's portrayal in John Ford's 1938 film YOUNG MR. LINCOLN, and Gregory Peck's in the epic 1982 TV miniseries THE BLUE AND THE GRAY. Sally Field is also superlative as his wife Mary Lincoln; and Holbrook and Jones, seasoned veterans both, are excellent as the men fighting the good fight.The usual excellent score by John Williams (with some period music thrown in) and the cinematography by Spielberg's usual DP Janusz Kaminski, along with the performances, make this 149 minute-long epic extremely breathless; and Tony Kushner's fine screenplay, based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book ""A Team Of Rivals"", gives the cast and Spielberg plenty to work with. As LINCOLN proves once again, Spielberg is a director capable of bringing the most difficult subject matter to dramatic life and understanding more about ourselves as human beings and as a nation at large. Great filmmaking does that, and, without question, LINCOLN is an example of great filmmaking; and I would rank it as the single best film of 2012.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Highly detailed, well acted but sometimes tedious","Firstly, Daniel Day-Lewis gave a great performance, worthy of an Oscar. Leaving that aside, the film can be described as a reconstruction in great detail. This was necessary because many Americans already know much of the story and would rightly complain if Hollywood simplified this bit of their history with its quasi-religious overtones. However there were occasions when you would have liked them to just get on with it. Despite this precision, the anachronistic recitation of the Gettysburg Address by the soldiers is so obviously clunky that it is a wonder that Spielberg didn't spot it. With Lincoln himself available, it seems that he should have given his own speech. The apologies inserted at the end for things that Lincoln wished he hadn't said also seemed to be a blatant piece of Band-Aid. Interestingly, instead of scene in Ford's Theatre, they had a scene in another theater reminiscent of Erich Leinsdorf's announcement of the assassination of President Kennedy.For me the film highlighted the fundamental flaw with the American Constitution that is still with us today. To get things done the proverbial 'pork-barrel' is still needed. There often has to be something in it for everyone, whatever the merits of any given proposition on its own. Vested interests still rule and in an era of fiscal cliffs, this is worrying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mr Spielberg you did a great job!! it's worth it!!,"The film itself, has a strong script, that has only the right amount of talking, but not only that, if you mute and watch the film without the sound, you can easily understand what it is all about by just looking at the visual features, just the images,. The film is based in historical facts, and it's historical accuracy it's pretty good, but of course it's always a little bit ', as all ''Hollywood'' films are. As in all Hollywood films, the facts are a little extended and exaggerated to give a little bit of ''salt'' in the film,and make it more interesting to the public to see. I think they did it well,they had the right amount of ''salt'' and even then it didn't became historically inaccurate, Steven Spielberg did a great job. Because of that, i believe the right amount of historical accuracy and the right amount of exaggeration, made the film successful, because it didn't bore the public, but it stood there with strong solid historical facts, without becoming a boring ''documentary''. It had heart and emotion to it, with the great performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally field, that made us see, that Abraham Lincoln was not just a legend, not just a president, but a human being,a father, a husband, with problems and worries as we all have, and most of all a man who sacrificed his life, and his well being in the name of his ideals.

I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who's interested about the Civil War and all that happened during that time. The film demonstrated Lincoln's patience very well I would say. All Lincoln tried to do was end slavery and the war. The movie really showed his patience dealing with all this commotion. The end of the film caught me by surprise, in a good way.

A Stooping Soft-Spoken Politician Saves a Nation,"Former portrayals of Abraham Lincoln via Hollywood have characterized him as a thundering man of resolve with a deep resonant voice whose utterances ring of an Old-Testament prophet. Of course, how could such a man, regarded by many as the savior of the United States, be anything but? However, the primary sources do not align with these ideals. At 6'4"", Lincoln was a lanky and stooping creature with long thin legs which would give any basketball point guard a run for his money. He often walked with a bit of a sway, sliding his feet along the floor with a lurch. And he was devoid of a low resonant voice like that of Charleton Heston or Burt Lancaster.The current film, directed by Spielberg and written by Tony Kushner, portrays the US's 16th president closer to the primary sources. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is no less than stunning. He speaks with a high, often raspy voice which is how the primary sources from the time describe it. He slithers along when he walks, almost as if he has never gotten used to his height. He had a funny way of telling stories, sometimes irritating those around him with his sermon-like pronouncements. He comes off like a protestant preacher, quoting Old Testament passages at will.But Lincoln was a master politician. He had two problems. Uniting the country by eradicating the Confederacy, and emancipating the slaves. The story focuses on a crucial yet sometimes overlooked moment in Civil War history: the very end of the war beginning in January, 1865. In this moment Lincoln needed his emancipation proclamation passed by the House of Representatives. (It had already passed the Senate.) But hard-line southern democrats engaged political road blocks to stop passage. And he needed a swift surrender from the Southern Confederacy.How would Lincoln achieve both goals? During the film, some of his advisers foretell that he can accomplish only one of the two. He could lift slave emancipation as a condition of southern surrender. If the Emancipation passes, he could face southern resistance for an even longer period thus taking the lives of more young men. The story focuses on Lincoln's efforts to pass Emancipation as well as ending the war. The fight in the House is a bloody war of words with stiff resistance from the hard-line democrats and uneasy middle-of-the-roader's fearing they'll be killed or chastised for voting to end slavery.An honorable mention goes to Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, an unflappable opponent of slavery and secession. Stevens was elected to the House of Representatives in 1848 and had added his voice to those of other abolitionists. His rhetoric in the face of biting argument becomes the unifying force which eventually leads the House into the direction they need to end slavery and make the US whole again. I assume he'll be nominated for Best Supporting Actor.Spielberg's best since ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Lincoln"" shows how history often unfolds in very unpredictable ways. The final vote to end slavery was not a slam-dunk event as often portrayed by history text books. The effort was calculated and took many weeks to accomplish. Many private meetings, and even some bribery, were the means required to accomplish the task. Lincoln also had to be careful to respect to some degree the rebels while simultaneously not recognizing them as a sovereign state. Since property rights were a condition of being a US citizen, the emancipation of slavery becomes a somewhat legal conundrum. Lincoln was a lawyer at heart, and needed a way to justify his means. This film gives a very clear sense of the obstacles which nearly hindered the United States from becoming a ""more perfect union"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Spielberg and DDL at the their best.,"Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is an incredible film. It is probably the most subtle and restrained film you will ever see from the director, and all the better for it. It is also probably one of the most brilliantly acted movies of all time. Daniel Day-Lewis as Abraham Lincoln is phenomenal to whiteness. You forget that you are watching an actor, and when the credits roll, you feel as if you just hung out with Lincoln for 2 and half hours. DDL is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of our time. That being said, there is not a performance in this movie that can be faulted.This film features a tremendous supporting cast, who each gets their own moment to shine.Lincoln is a movie that feels very real and authentic, and is able to engross you in the world and in the lives of the people it portrays. I can understand some people really not liking this movie, because it is not an action piece, but a heavily dialogue driven movie, which some can find extremely boring. There is one, extremely brief battle scene which is followed by dialogue, and dialogue, and more dialogue. But in my opinion, the dialogue in this movie is some of the most beautiful and witted dialogue I have heard in recent memory. The screenplay overall is 'A' solid.Some may also argue that the ending of the film wasn't handled well, but I think the way Spielberg executed the final moments of the movie was done so in the proper way and was not off-putting from the rest of the movie.I think the movie falls just short of a masterpiece due to the fact that there were a few moments were the movie felt like it was dragging a bit and a few times where my mind started to wander onto something else while I was watching, but I was always able to quickly latch back on.But that being said, I think the movie is excellent and one of Spielberg's greatest achievements. I walked out of the theater moved and wanting more.If you have any interest in film, great acting, or history, Lincoln is a movie for you!",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln,"With the American civil war looking like it might finally be drawing to a close, President Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) is increasingly turning his attention to the passing of the 13th amendment to the constitution. This will not only vindicate the whole point of his fighting the war in the first place, but will enshrine legally the prohibition of any person owning anyone else, or of forcing them into a life of indentured slavery. He is aided by his Secretary of State Seward (David Strathairn) and by his formidable wife Mary (Sally Field) but he is opposed by many in the House of Representatives whom his lobby must convince to support him else it will fail. It's quite a catch-22 that he finds himself in. Should the war finish quickly, he runs the risk of the southern states kiboshing it altogether even though an early peace would undoubtedly save thousands of lives. His own advisors are split on the issue, indeed some see the bill as excessive or even dangerous should it end up with 4 millions of African Americans getting the vote! It's a political melting pot that's only exacerbated by his son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) wanting to enlist and obviously his mother determined this ought not to be permitted to happen! Day-Lewis is on splendid form here as he resists the temptation to merely mimic previous representations of the man and in so during imbues him with quite a degree of characterful conflict. A man of principle whose principles were not so straightforward to apply. Moreover, many of his opponents are equally impassioned in their intransigence with accusations of treachery being levelled angrily, and that perspective is well represented too. There's a solid cast of support here with an almost unrecognisable James Spader's Bilbo, Tommy Lee Jones as the scathingly witty Thaddeus Stevens and Jared Harris sparingly appearing as General Grant all adding depth to this chronology. It's all history, so we know how it all ends, but the top quality production design and the subtly accumulating tension really does offer some semblance of authenticity to the look of the film. It passes two and an half hours surprisingly interestingly and offers us a glimpse of a man in very capable hands.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

He Belongs To The Ages.,"It's a more demanding film than you might think. Lincoln, the sixteenth president of the United States, ruled for a bit more than four years during a period of turmoil unparalleled in American history. And he pulled is through it all until he was cut down by an assassin.I'm not at all sure he'd be allowed to do it today. I kept thinking, while watching this rather long, dark, complicated movie about Lincoln's struggle to pass the law that would free all the slaves everywhere -- not the weak Emancipation Proclamation but the Constitutional Amendment -- that he may well never have been elected to national office of any kind.In Mike Nichols' ""Primary Colors"" John Travolta is running for president and when he falls behind in the polls he dithers over whether his campaign should ""go negative"". That was 1998. Today the question would never be raised because everything is negative and the ""opposition research"" is phenomenally effective -- hated by everyone and it works like a charm.The specialists of today would have made mincemeat of Lincoln's candidacy. They would begin with the big ears, the hint of villainy in his features, his warts. In his youth he experienced what today we would call a major affective disorder, which would unquestionably be called ""bipolar."" His minimal political experience would be a major stumbling block -- a few years in the state legislature. Everything he ever wrote would be examined for a misplaced comma. He was tall, gangly, had the appearance of a hick, and was unphotogenic. The tale of his sneaking into Washington disguised as a woman would be accepted as fact by many. He'd have a mountain of trouble being elected today.Yet he was arguably the best president the United States has ever had. Aided by his secretary, he wrote his own speeches and they were marvels of lucidity. The Gettysburgh Address, which isn't his most compelling, has been compared to Pericles' funeral oration. He successfully managed to walk a political tightrope with abolitionists jeering from one side and an outraged audience of Democrats throwing objects at him from the other. It's hard to imagine how he could have done it without going nuts all over again.Spielberg's movie captures the familiar figure of Lincoln -- the awkwardness, the tall folk stories, the absence of bombast. (At Gettyburgh, the man who preceded Lincoln spoke for more than two hours; Lincoln's address was less than 250 words long.) Daniel Day-Lewis could hardly be better. The torment is there but Day-Lewis keeps a lid on it. Everyone else is professional, though the movie belongs to Lincoln.It was a curious decision to focus the story on the struggle to pass the fourteenth amendment. It's not usually thought of as an illustrious moment, only as a footnote to the winning of the Civil War. But the writers dig into the issue and it's a little like turning over a rock and seeing slimy little white things wriggling for cover. Votes in favor of passage were happily bought by Lincoln's administration. If there's a lame duck Democrat you can buy his vote by promising him that he will be appointed postmaster somewhere. It's all taken for granted.Nothing here about Lincoln's more celebrated and arguable actions. He used a flimsy excuse to throw the politicians of Baltimore into jail without habeus corpus. He was under Confederate fire on the outskirts of the capitol. Nothing about his delegatory sins. The astonishing disappointment of some of his appointments -- MacClellan (twice), Burnside, and the rest -- don't come up. His first cabinet, he filled idealistically with his political rivals, with the expected results -- chaos.Moreover, the movie is in some ways confusing and dull. Not the fault of either the performers or the director but the script is a mish-mash of personalities and conflict that are hard to keep straight. And almost all of it seems to take place in sepulchral interiors. Lincoln was as good as they come but the movie isn't.In the end, concentrating on the fourteenth amendment may have been a wise choice. It encompassed most of the awesome and terrifying dynamics that surrounded Lincoln during his entire period in office. And I'd like to shake Spielberg's hand for sparing us from still another trite staging of the assassination at Ford's theater.It's in some ways a challenging movie. The kids will wonder what all the fuss was about. They may even say, ""So THAT'S who Lincoln was."" But overall it's quite a spectacle and maybe an object history lesson.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

An intelligent exercise in non-committal...,"It disturbs me when I think of how much money Steven Spielberg made for this. A glorified stage play, from the bottom to the top. Boring from start to finish. I hope to God Sally Field gets the Oscar she deserves for keeping this dull, talkie movie from being completely unwatchable. Her performance was the only true bright spot in an otherwise dreary, but intelligent exercise in non-committal. The Civil War scene was just Spielberg trying to scare the audience without committing and it was as transparent as glass.How did the director of Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan (not to mention War of the Worlds) drop the ball on the most important and compelling American subject of all time, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, SLAVERY and THE CIVIL WAR??? Ten minutes into this movie and I wanted to walk out, and two hours later nothing had changed. I could feel the suffering in the theater and the fake laughter they were all conjuring to try and keep themselves from wanting to die from pure boredom. Why Spielberg pulled a Chicago Cubs and dropped the ball on this subject is beyond me. The movie is almost insipid, its so bad. Spielberg made the mistake of trying to educate rather than entertain. There was more of Lincoln's spirit in ""Glory"" than there was in this entire vanity project. One of the biggest disappointments in the history of movies.",1.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Equally Before the Law,"Greetings again from the darkness. The movie lover in me has been anxiously awaiting this one for months. On the other hand, as a citizen, the recent Presidential campaign antics put me in quite the political funk. Tired of the rhetoric and disenchanted with the current leadership, I was concerned my thoughts might poison the outlook on director Steven Spielberg's latest. Fortunately, both Lincoln and ""Lincoln"" allowed me to forget those in charge today, and instead witness the look and feel of true leadership and greatness.Despite the title, this is not simply a biographical sketch of our 16th President. Rather, it's an essay on back room politics ... the key to Washington and democracy. Deal-cutting, horse-trading, arm-twisting are just some of the strategies involved in reaching compromise. When the stakes are history ... abolishing slavery ... the passion of those unseen actions is intensified. We see a man at the height of his power willing to do what is necessary to reach a goal in which he fervently believes - even though his views are not shared by a great many others.Some of the most fun in the film occurs during the House floor debates between Republicans and Democrats. These scenes serve as a reminder that the two parties are often at philosophical odds and, just as designed, debate and discussion lead to compromise and advancement. At least that's the general idea and purpose. Next to Daniel Day-Lewis' performance, err, embodiment of Lincoln, the script is what really jumped out at me. Loosely based on ""Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln"" by Doris Kearns Goodwin, Tony Kushner's screenplay serves up dialogue that is sharp, crisp, entertaining, thought-provoking and filled with message. This is a very talky film, not a Civil War film. We only get a couple of brief battlefield scenes, but the conversations never allow us to forget that the brutal war is always on the mind of the politicians and citizens.Having always been fascinated by Abraham Lincoln, and familiar with the legend, the icon, the monuments, the statues, it was with true awe that I recognize what Daniel Day-Lewis delivers. His presence is so powerful that I found it all but impossible to look at anything else when he was on screen. That will certainly mandate a second viewing, but I have no hesitancy in recommending a film that brings to life what a great man can be ... what true leadership can be. This is a man who carries his burdens in his soul. He may have been self-educated, but in addition to Shakespeare and Euclid, Mr. Lincoln understood people. That knowledge allowed him to maintain his high principles through patience and reasoning and even (sometimes) humorous story-telling.We are never allowed to forget that this is a Spielberg movie. The scenes with Lincoln and Mary Todd (Sally Field) are somewhat distracting to the greater stories, but perhaps that's the point. These discussions were distractions to him as well. In fact, Spielberg is quite kind to Mary Todd Lincoln. Other tales have not been. Either way, Ms. Field is effective, though I wish she had less screen time.The supporting cast is a who's who of character actors. Most won't be named here but Tommy Lee Jones is a key player as Rep. Thaddeus Stevens, a radical abolitionist; David Strathairn as Sec of State William Steward has Lincoln's trust; Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays Lincoln's son; and Jackie Earle Haley plays the Confederate VP Alexander Stevens. There is also a tribunal of political lobbyists or fixers that add quite the element of dirty-politics: James Spader, John Hawkes and Tim Blake Nelson. There is a quick scene at Appomattox showing General Robert E Lee, and we get a couple of scenes with General Ulysses S Grant (Jared Harris).Lastly, the score from the great John Williams excels and compliments the mood and pace of the story ... he is careful to never overwhelm. Williams is probably in line for his 48th Oscar nomination (second only to Walt Disney). This is a film about process and the people who made that process work - even at a time when everyone thought the choice had to be made between ending the war and abolishing slavery. Choose one, you can't have both. Abraham Lincoln proved that sometimes the right man is in the right place at the right time. Unfortunately, those times come around very rarely.

"The tag team of director Steven Spielberg, star Daniel Day-Lewis, and screenwriter Tony Kushner equal a powerful examination of Lincoln's life.","I've been eagerly anticipating this movie for months, and what wasn't there to look forward to? It's directed by Steven Spielberg, my favorite living director, as well as the director of my all time favorite movie Jurassic Park. It stars a magnificent cast, including Daniel Day- Lewis, one of my favorite actors, and it's written by Tony Kushner, the mind behind the masterpiece Angels in America. With all three of them working together, how could this go wrong? In short, it doesn't. Lincoln is among the best movies of 2012, and at least better than that horrid Vampire Hunter clone.The movie focuses entirely on the last few months of Lincoln's presidency. In this time, he seeks to put a stop to the Civil War, which has now begun its fourth year, but in doing so, he also hopes to pass the 13th amendment and abolish slavery. He has no problem with getting help within his own house, but he faces a challenge in convincing enough members of the Democratic Party to pass the bill. On the side, he's also facing troubles within his own family, specifically his oldest son wanting to enlist in the Union.That may seem fairly standard for a biopic, but the movie manages to transcend that. It's a character study and commentary that gets down to its issues with aplomb. This is some of Steven Spielberg's best direction, wisely dialing down the sentimentality, and allowing for a more refined, procedural, and organic presentation. Even his usual craftspeople tone down their own style, much to the film's benefit. The way Spielberg handles actors is always a highlight as well, with a large cast of fantastic character actors that makes finding a standout among the supporting players tedious. None are better than Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. Virtually unrecognizable, and comfortably slipping into the emotion of the character like a pair of shoes, he gives another incredible performance to add to his already strong portfolio.Then we get down to Tony Kushner, whose screenplay is the final necessary piece of this beautiful puzzle. He manages to get right into the head of Lincoln, his familial troubles, and his personality traits, and strongly examines the racial issues and bipartisanship without glossing over them. There are a lot of long conversations in this movie, and Kushner does well to make sure that they're never boring. He deserves kudos for the riveting dialogue, and the appropriate doses of humor, but just as much thanks ought to go to Editor Michael Kahn and his fantastic pacing. The ending does seem a bit too long, but considering everything that came before it, I'm willing to forgive and overlook such a thing. The movie is a brilliant look into history, and a definitive representation of who Lincoln was as a person. Recommended without hesitation.***** / *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

A Lincoln Portrait for the Ages,"This film is highly recommended.Film biographies have also seemed to be a stodgy affair, the biased mishandling of fact and fiction to make the subject more compelling than life itself. Steven Spielberg's Lincoln is a remarkable achievement, a concise and engaging film that treats both the man and the myth with an evenhandedness and craft that simply impresses the moviegoer at any level.The film is based on the best-selling novel, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin, but the director shrewdly focuses the film on Lincoln's final months and the the passing of the 13th Amendment. As war rages on and the nation is torn apart, the political climate is awash with abolitionists and pro-slavery forces, with neither sides willing to bulge or be nonpartisan. ( Sadly, history continues to repeat itself. )Spielberg has always been one of our most accomplished directors and here he shies away from his tendency to sentimentalize this subject matter and make it more palpable for mass consumption. He renders the brutality of war with mere images of the carnage that became the Civil War and layers his film with that high cost of freedom. There is no dumbing down of the story, plot, or its large cast of characters. Everything is richly created, with a high level of excellence in the production design by Rick Carter, gorgeous photography and lighting by Janusz Kaminski, an unfussy and stirring score by John Williams, and wonderful period costuming by Joanna Johnson. Foremost is a literate screenplay by the talented Tony Kushner that engages the audience from the start. Kushner's dialog, characterizations, and speeches have an intellectual and poetic nuance that distinguishes this film from other standard film biographies.Lincoln has a tendency to bog down a bit with the internal political manipulations and schemes needed to ratify this amendment to the Constitution. In fact, some scenes about the internal battles of the politicians became somewhat repetitive to me. Additional screen time and depth given to the president's personal life and less emphasis on the governmental bureaucracy would have made this film even more compelling.However, Spielberg seems more interested in the ethical complexities of the issue of slavery and the moral consciences of the politicians at that time than Lincoln's family dynamics. He even uses some actors as a pseudo Greek chorus to establish more clarity for the movie audience and mirror those legislative point of views. Spielberg tries to equate the similarities of America's government then and now ( the use of lobbyists, the influence of the media, the wheeling and dealing to sway a vote ) and he succeeds brilliantly.The director assembles an excellent cast in telling his story. At the center of the film is a towering performance by Daniel Day-Lewis as the 16th president. His lanky physique, angular facial structure, and awkward demeanor truly captures the man and our predetermined notion of him. Throughout the film, Day-Lewis eloquently delivers many speeches, tirades, and witticisms with much authority and passion. His portrayal is wholesome, restrained, and understated, quite powerful in its completeness.Among the many supporting roles that standout ( Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Lee Pace, Stephen Spinella, Gloria Reuben, and the trio of James Spader, Tim Blake Nelson, and John Hawkes ), two veteran actors invest themselves wholeheartedly into their roles: Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones. As Mary Todd Lincoln, Fields distances herself from the clichéd crazy First Lady persona and brings a stateliness and emotional center to the film. Her bond with Lewis seems authentic and helps to add the most affecting moments to the film. Jones plays Thaddeus Stevens as a highly moral but audacious and impudent politician, a man not afraid to bully a rival into submission or change course for the cause of equality. Along with Day-Lewis, both Field and Jones should be getting more accolades this award season.Historically speaking, it is safe to state that Lincoln was a great man. Cinematically speaking, it is also safe to say that Spielberg's Lincoln is a great film.

Everything's great except...,"First, the good part: As everybody says, the acting (and not only DDL's) is excellent. The production values are first class. The film effectively explores an important moment in US history, the Republican attempt to gain congressional approval of the 13th amendment abolishing slavery -- the Emancipation Proclamation applied only to the states in rebellion, and it was feared it would lose its legal standing after the conclusion of the war. The film makes clear the complexity and sometimes corruption of Lincoln's efforts to gain approval of the amendment. Best of all, the facts as presented seem well researched and in accord with history, a rarity in movies such as this.However, like so many of Spielberg's recent films, this one is long on quality of manufacture and short on inspiration. Every emotional moment seems carefully and obviously planned for effect. This suffuses every scene -- the staginess and artificiality of direction constantly defeat the actors' best efforts to breathe life into their characters. And the first segment, especially, is unbearably crass and false -- fortunately not repeated to the same extent anywhere else.I'll give Lincoln a 6/10 for its production quality, clarity, accuracy, acting, and the importance of its subject matter.

Fitted for Eternity by Ivette Fred-Rivera,"It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. (Last passage of the Address Delivered at the Dedication of the Cemetery at Gettysburg, Abraham Lincoln November 19, 1863.)Opening shot: the American Civil War, the first person we see and hear is a young black man, soldier during 10 long years, the second we hear is Lincoln -whom we don't see yet, we will see him very soon from the back, the audience's position, asking about his situation, the third that speaks is another black soldier. They are paid less than whites. But in a hundred years, they will vote. This visionary soldier recites words of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address of 1863, the most quoted words in American political history. Lincoln, in turn, asks and listens to the Other: ""Abraham Africanus the 1rst"", as his detractors called him. The movie shows Lincoln's distinctive command of language, his good sense of humor, his ability to tell stories and to make the political issue personal to others by narrating an anecdote or a parable. Also his capacity for argumentation, guided by a clear vision. For example, his knowledge of Euclid's self-evident principles gives him a case for visionary imagination. Mathematics and logic as well as ethics have to do with the imagination, with seeing the consequences of the premises, and seeing the consequences of one's actions. Lincoln strongly believed that we had to end first slavery, then the Civil War, as the first was the cause and the second the effect. This seems simple, self-evident reasoning, but it is really difficult to recognize the order of priorities, which comes first and what comes next. His advisers saw it exactly reversed. Lincoln is emphatic: the passing of the thirteenth amendment is a military necessity. Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) advised him after the reelection: 'you are loved by people, you can do whatever you want now, do not waste this opportunity'. The depiction of the relationship between Mr. President and Mrs. President (as she names herself) is an asset in the characterization. Mrs. Lincoln says that her experience will help ordinary people, presumably like herself, to understand what meant to be with an extraordinary man during extraordinary times. (The irony involved reminded me of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.) The characterization of Lincoln is well balanced because of these interactions. Though Lincoln is very conscious of his solitude, calls himself ""the king of infinite space"", and prefers to think alone. Rep. Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones), the most powerful abolitionist in the House, takes the House approval of the thirteenth amendment original document to his maid-mistress. For a moment I thought he would take it to Lincoln, at the top, to celebrate their triumph, but instead he brought it to whom this resolution will directly affect in real life, the people who are at the bottom, with no voice as are not even considered people. Very tragic and ironic for the Democratic Party to have been so blind and troglodyte in this historic moment. Lincoln is not afraid of the future, the unknown, the challenges ahead, he recognizes that he does not know black people and that he defends their freedom as a matter of principle (as a Kantian would do); he will learn from them in the process. Interesting, Lincoln needs to experience the sight of the victims, of their corpses. 'Never have seen anything like this.' Excellent cinematography by Janusz Kaminski; mastery of light and shadow, chiaroscuro, of the composition of cinematographic space, the interplay of interiors and exteriors, of angles, particularly, the diagonals that give movement, depth and the impression of a larger space. These techniques were masterly used by Vermeer and Murnau. The windows, outside light coming through the window to the interior space, and the exterior seen in the distance. Father and young son, their shadows reflected as a vision of future free generations. Excellent performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Very handsome and stylized Lincoln!! ""How tall is he?"" The height, the attitude, the physical and moral heights. It is a very difficult challenge to perform ""Lincoln"", he is very iconic and heavy. Father Abraham wants to travel to the Holy Land after so many years of suffering. A black servant is the last person seeing President Lincoln walking away from the camera after his Amendment has been passed. Lincoln's death, the first US president assassination, is presented briefly. It reminded me of the Iliad where neither the death nor the funeral of Achilles appear. In the penultimate shot, dead Lincoln is lying on a small bed, nestled as a boy, his face quite calm, obviously, his murder has not astonished him; then in the final scene at the Capitol, Lincoln is standing erect, in action, delivering a speech to the multitude in the middle of the frame. Again, command of composition, of inner space and outer space. The joy for such a victory and the sadness for his tragic death. For Lincoln, as a remarkably responsible president (like king Oedipus), both spaces, both bodies -the political and the private- are only one.Thank you very much for the beautiful gift, director Spielberg.""Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party duly shall have been convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.""

Ideal Movie for Substitute Teachers,"From a film production standpoint 'Lincoln' is a Masterclass. There's an ensemble of actors crossing generational divides all knocking it out of the park. The direction, cinematography, sets, costumes, score and editing are exactly what you would expect from prime Spielberg.That being said, there isn't much here for a general audience seeking entertainment. The focus is primarily on the political negotiations during the end of his presidency, so a lot of reenactments of meetings and contract law. Maybe it's historically accurate, maybe not; I'm not going to split hairs over who said what to who during weeks of congressional debate.It's not that 'Lincoln' is a bad film, to the contrary, every freedom-loving American should see it, but I'd personally rather watch a documentary to gain a high-level understanding of that period. In Lewis' portrayal, Lincoln seemed like a steady-hand when the country needed it most, but it doesn't necessarily translate to an interesting character on screen- Honest Abe's no Andrew Jackson or Bill the Butcher.Hmm, DDL playing AJ would be absolutely wild; I'd definitely watch that.

"Remarkable times produce remarkable men, sometimes","If only. That's what I felt leaving the theater, if only Lincoln had lived, if only we had a Lincoln during Vietnam, if only we had a Lincoln today.

So much deserved praise has been written about this film - the acting, the music, the cinematography, the costumes, the screenplay, and more - that I thought I'd mention another aspect of Spielberg's genius, his talent for directing fine actors in small roles. In most film with big stars, the camera stays on the central character and everyone else is window dressing, little more than moving mannequins. In ""Lincoln"", in scenes crowded with actors, the performances are choreographed brilliantly. Take Bruce McGill's portrayal of Edwin Stanton. He captures Stanton perfectly, and does it mostly with facial expressions and his posture. Hawkes' Latham. Nelson's Schell. McRobbie's Pendleton. I wish there was a special Oscar given to Spielberg for ensemble direction, only Scorsese rivals him. Day-Lewis, Obama, and Lincoln at the time of the passage of the 13th amendment, are all basically the same age. I imagine this gives Day-Lewis great insight into Lincoln's commanding presence, his mastery of men.

Lincoln's lobbyism and political squabble,"I guess the days when Steven Spielberg created simple, exhilarating films are irrevocably over. My favourite of his is probably his very first, Duel, made in 1971, and the distance from that picture to his latest historical biopic, Lincoln, is enormous in every sense. This year's entry is a comprehensive, untiring study of the final months of Abraham Lincoln's life and his work to get the Thirteenth Amendment passed by the House of Representatives while the Civil War raged on into its final stage around the country. It's a film about lobbyism and political squabble, full of anecdotes and characterizations by and of Lincoln himself, who is gracefully (perhaps a little too gracefully) played by the impeccable Daniel Day-Lewis, who mimics mannerisms and speech like few others - and falls in love with his characters like few others.Lincoln differs from Spielberg's other historical epics (The Color Purple, Schindler's List, Amistad) in that it's lacking the obvious grandeur in imagery and dramatizations. And thank goodness for that, because this has been a trait which hasn't worked to these films' advantage - they've been oversaturated with goodness and meaning. In Lincoln, Spielberg's not striving so much for the grandiose as for the detailed, and through this almost obsessive attention to detail he's showing some of the same uncompromisingness which made some of his earliest films so remarkable. With that said, Lincoln still is a message movie and a somewhat uncritical biographical account where the title character feels a little too saintly and modern in his perspectives (the latter is true also for many other characters, such as the soldiers in the improbable opening scene). I'm by no means a history scholar, so I cannot assess the accuracy of how these proceedings or Mr. Lincoln himself are portrayed, but there are a handful of scenes here which seem out of place, like for instance one where Lincoln has a chat with his black maid on the porch. I'm not contesting the historical aspects of such scenes, but rather the melodrama Spielberg makes them into.I'm not, however, criticizing the dialogue and the talkative nature of the film, which may well feel magniloquent for modern moviegoers. Some may even find it boring, but I liked it and value it as one of the hallmarks of the film. People obviously conversed in a different tone and tempo 150 years ago than they do today, and I think Spielberg captures this well. However, in his invariable focus on these conversations he also creates a ceremonial and occasionally undynamic piece, before clutching somewhat clumsily at the few dramatic opportunities that arise, such as the balancing of the votes in the House of Representatives. The political mechanisms portrayed are continually interesting, but some of the interpersonal and character portrayals feel simplified.Alas, Lincoln is a flawed film - far more flawed than how Lincoln himself comes off here. It's also very condensed, despite its lengthy running time; there were many other aspects to the abolishment of slavery in the United States than what is discussed here. Still, as a period piece and a biographical account, the film is both highly fascinating and to some degree important. Spielberg demonstrates that he's able to shake off some of his most pompous traits as a director. Now he only needs to rid himself of the outdated John Williams and his increasingly vapid musical scores.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Memorial worthy movie making.,"Steven Spielberg, America's greatest movie director, has made over 20 feature films. He's had a few misses, but mostly he's been very good to excellent & he's had a few outright classics & ""Lincoln"" is one of those classics.Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of those very few hype-proof performances. No matter how much praise you have heard about his portrayal of the 16th President Of The United States you are still not quite prepared for it (reminding me of Heath Ledger's work as ""The Joker"" in this regard). His Lincoln is very lived in, worn but not worn down, looking like the weight of the nation is upon his shoulders & looking strong enough to bear up under it. He's funny, warm, calculating, coarse, smarter than most, but wise enough to know he doesn't have all the answers. He has a code that will not break. Day-Lewis's turns in a performances that rates alongside Pacino's Michael Corleone & Ledger's villainous turn as my all-time favorite.However there are other great performances in this film, most notably by Tommy Lee Jones as a crucial ally to get the 13th Amendment passed during the final weeks of Lincoln's life that the film covers. Every key actor in this prodigious cast has a moment or two that stuns.None of this is possible without a script by Tony Kushner that may even surpass Day-Lewis's work. It features more than a few speeches written with a love of the language--of English & the English of that time-- rarely heard anywhere in America & they are often thrillingly delivered by a cast up to the challenge. It is also rich in irony (I don't think the Democratic Party during this period would've won the ""black vote"".)So all that Spielberg has to do is yell ""Action!"" & ""Cut!"". Of course it's not that simple. The great gift of a great director is to know how much guidance is needed to get the job done. There are no obvious Spielberg moments here (like another Kushner scripted movie, ""Munich"", that he directed), but you know that you're in the hands of a cinematic master.John Williams' score is subtle. Michael Kahn's cutting let the moments breathe without ever dragging out too long. Janusz Kaminski has said that he merely let his cinematography ""serve the story"", but he's being a bit too humble. His shots are a stunning parade of shadows & natural light. They don't call attention themselves but, nevertheless, it is a beautiful movie to watch. The set design, costumes, art direction & everything else are Oscar worthy.""Lincoln"" isn't a movie you ""should"" see (although you should) it is a movie you'll want to see. Despite it lack of physical action it is every bit as entertaining as ""Argo"" & ""The Dark Knight Rises"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A Realistic Portrayal of Our Best President and The Highest Levels of Government in 1865,"There has been much criticism of ""Lincoln"" being too cerebral, focusing too much on the fight for the 13th amendment to the constitution, or having limited perspective due to an absence of camera tricks and aerial shots of Washington, DC, but all of these criticisms fail to see the beauty and originality of this movie. Spielberg and Tony Kushner, who penned the screenplay and also the screenplay for the most audacious and powerfully challenging of Spielberg's films, ""Munich,"" have focused on portraying the inner workings of the U.S. federal government during the Civil War, and also on Abraham Lincoln's brilliance and humility in presiding over the most challenging and impactful period of U.S. history. This focus required a look at the dialog between important government figures, as well as the common foot-soldiers on the front lines, as well as Lincoln's unique humor, intelligence, and compassion in addressing his responsibilities. It also required an attention to detail unequalled in previous films depicting this time period, and no aerial shots, as there was no aerial photography in the 1860's United States.The realism and historical details in this movie extend to the brief scenes with General U.S. Grant, showing that one of his aids was a Native American (the fascinating Ely S. Parker, who deserves a movie devoted to his life story), the lack of security at the White House, and the peculiar and unrefined characters that men of great influence in the Capital used to accomplish their political aims. Lincoln himself is portrayed with some of the common character flaws of the men of his day, as evident in his blunt and honest discussions with the African American characters in the movie, but the movie also shows clearly Lincoln's robust character in recognizing his own prejudices and the prejudices resulting in slavery and the oppression of African Americans in general in the 1860's. It also focuses on Lincoln's efforts to get the Congress to pass the 13th amendment abolishing slavery throughout the U.S. While this leaves no time to portray other fascinating aspects of Lincoln's life, it also clearly shows Lincoln's brilliance in political maneuvering, his humility, and his commitment to doing what he knew was the right thing for the country and for its people - all of its people - even though he knew he would be hated for it in many quarters (and it led to his assassination).The performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, David Strathairn, Sally Field, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones and many others are wonderful, and they give the movie its realism and emotional punch in the midst of the speeches and sweeping scenes. This movie was obviously a labor of love to which many fine artists gave everything they had. Daniel Day-Lewis again demonstrates his complete immersion into the character he is portraying, and the fact that many viewers find this Irish actor's portrayal a believable incarnation of a larger-than-life real U.S. person is in itself a minor miracle. See this movie - it will enrich your life, entertain you, and give you better understanding of U.S. history and our finest president.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
A film for the ages,"I was totally pulled into Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Lincoln. He was Abraham Lincoln! One of the finest performances I have ever witnessed on film. Creating a film faithful to a historical figure is a challenge. Spielberg met that challenge and then some. All the actors complemented one another in very believable ways. Sally Field was very convincing as Mary Todd Lincoln and added depth to the film. Historical accuracy in a film such as this is an absolute must because everyone knows about Abraham Lincoln. This is the place where Daniel Day-Lewis' performance shines. I used to think Raymond Massey's version was accurate, but next to Day-Lewis there is absolutely no comparison.Though I believe Lincoln should have won the Best Picture Oscar, the politics surrounding the balloting of the Academy of Arts And Sciences prevented that from happening. This film should be required viewing for every high school student in America. This film made our 16th President come alive. As a great, great, great nephew of William H. Seward, I came away from this movie with a great sense of pride in his support and friendship for America's greatest President.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Made me think less of the real Abraham Lincoln,"Lincoln may be an interesting film for some, but not for me. I didn't like it. This movie seems like it's nothing more than a vehicle for Daniel Day-Lewis' monologues, with filler lines from other characters in between. People argue, Lincoln interrupts and tells some random anecdote for five minutes straight as the camera slowly zooms in on him, and then everyone else nods after he finishes. Plus, this movie made me see Lincoln as just another egocentric politician instead of a hero. It's too long, it's too boring, and it's too bad that this film made me think less of the real Abraham Lincoln.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Should be called ""Stevens""","Most of the film concerns the machinations and compromises of getting the 13 th Amendment, outlawing slavery, passed in Congress. Thaddeus Stevens and the other radical Republicans were more important in this fight than Licncoln. It seems this is called Lincoln to attract viewers. Also, Stevens is depicted as too much of a bufoon. The acting, drsms and settings are terrific. Did you know it was a house Stevens owned in Gettysburg, rented to a balck woman, that Robert E. Lee used as his headquarters for that battle? Stevens willed that he not be buried in a segregated cemetery. The white cemeteries were all ""white only"" so he was buried in a black cemetery in Lancaster, PA.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
The moving trick of making an icon human,"For over 50 years, Raymond Massey (ABE LINCOLN IN ILLINOIS - 1940) has been the public image of the ideal and idealized Lincoln, but whatever the year end awards may think of Daniel Day Lewis' performance in Stephen Spielberg's LINCOLN, I think this may be the standard for the next fifty years: not of an idealized Lincoln, but a warmly believable, *human* Lincoln achieving his final and perhaps greatest political feat in the final months of his life.We are not given a perfect film to showcase Lewis' magnificent performance; to be honest, Spielberg has not found a satisfying emotional opening (an unconvincing close up of hand to hand combat) OR finish to his film following his triumph in the House Chamber and White House and the well finessed finale to Lincoln's life that we all know (and finding a fresh way to tell that tale, with young Tad in the seat at Grover's Theatre that his parents might have occupied, is in itself a minor achievement), David Strathairn's solid Secretary of State Seward is never allowed to show the warm literate relationship which made these two former rivals for the Republican nomination for President the envy of their Cabinet colleagues and Tad, the President's youngest son, is played with more an eye to the loving parent's image than the physically challenged (a cleft palate and lisp) historical reality, but the performances of the entire cast - Sally Field's magnificently layered Mary Todd Lincoln (""Molly"") and Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Robert Lincoln in an impassioned scene with his father outside the army surgery especially - more than make up for any failure of detail.VISUALLY, the detail is astounding, from the look of a still unpaved Washington and pre-electrified White House to Secretary of War Stanton's whiskers, the viewer is drawn into the historical reality of the last chapter or three of Doris Kearns Goodwin's magnificent ""Team of Rivals"" (the whole book follows Lincoln from the beginning of his drive for national office), and delineates Lincoln's drive to get the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, formally and finally abolishing slavery in the United States, passed on to the States shortly after his re-election and before the new Congress could be seated in the spring. It explains even more clearly than Kearns Goodwin had why the timing of the passage was so important to Lincoln and the country.Warner Brothers' 1972 transfer of the Broadway musical 1776, like the stage version before it, showed that with the proper skill and passion, it is possible to build great suspense around a historical political event the audience consciously KNOWS to have happened but may not know the drama which surrounded it originally - so it might be easy to slough off the second time the feat is achieved, but the achievement is far from easy and the result here is in many ways even more impressive than in the musical because there are no side issues to distract the debate over...well, less potent side issues. There, the issue was independence and the side issue was slavery. Here, the issue is slavery - as Ben Franklin had prophesied, a question for a later generation - and the side issue a broader equality - a question which WE know would take more than a hundred additional years to address.The film's requisite set pieces bridging the main body of the film and the end - the burning of Richmond and Lee's surrender - are somewhat perfunctory, but ultimately satisfying. It's a fair mark of how well the film held its audience when a dozen of the full house when I saw it stayed for the full ""crawl"" of the credits at the end.Over all, the film will leave you feeling a new respect and almost affectionate connection with our 16th President - one entirely appropriate at a time when we have just re-elected a president who so much of the country (admittedly in a FAR less divisive peacetime) has developed almost as warm, personal feelings about. It's fascinating to see Lincoln trying to hold his Republican Party together as the Radicals of HIS day (who were extreme LIBERALS) start to overwhelm the moderates from the perspective of a 21st century where the Radical Right has started to lose control of the party in the face of a president Lincoln made possible and who is, in fact, more like a Moderate Republican than a traditional Democrat.If the film can capitalize on its own quality and the fortuitous timing, my fondest wish is that much the same team could make ANOTHER Lincoln film from earlier chapters of ""Team Of Rivals"" focusing on Lincoln's drive for the presidency itself! That one should be a corker too, and a great legacy to a broader understanding and knowledge of our essential common history.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Interesting but too long.,"I would have scored it a seven if it was not so long. It's an interesting story but they could have made this movie at least one hour shorter. Interesting to me, for an European, as in school we never learned about the specific details of the American presidents and the American history. In fact I thought in the Civil War the ""bad ones"" were the republicans and the ""good ones"" the democrats but it's just the other way round. Strange to see that the republicans are the racists now or at least that's how I see them after Trump. So as an historical movie ""Lincoln"" is interesting, even though it's more about the thirteenth amendment than about Lincoln. Great acting of Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. The rest of the cast is also very good what makes Lincoln worth watching, even for someone like me that hates politics and everything that has to do with it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Spielberg's dream come true.....?,"One of Spielberg's ultimate dreams was to be able to make a Lincoln film. And after over a decade of speculation, we finally see the master director's vision come true---albeit in a manner we didn't really expect. While the film focuses mainly on Lincoln it narrows the structure down to his final months of the presidency and his life. Instead of the log cabin child to lawyer to president timeline, we get the end of war to 13th amendment timeline. But although it is masterfully acted and directed, it's a tough pill to swallow because of the length and because of its focus on the bare-knuckle politics of the time period.To keep it simple: if you dislike politics this will not be your cup of tea.This film however isn't without its assortment of strengths. For starters, let's please give the Oscars to Daniel Day-Lewis and Tommy Lee Jones, because they did phenomenal in their perspective roles. The rest of the cast did outstanding, ranging from Sally Field to James Spader to Hal Holbrook. Arguably the best ensemble cast within the past year, Lincoln is a movie that could have posed as a Broadway show because it was the acting that stole the show and maintained the film.However I can almost bet you anything that Steven Spielberg would have preferred a superior script that focused much more on Lincoln's life and less on the politics surrounding it. Nonetheless, he did a grand job with the script on the table and doesn't overdue or overblow the film with an abundance of style. It was framed like a high-budget play, and was paced like one. And this is where the audience can become alienated; in terms of content politics covets about eight-tenths of the movie.And this is where the film becomes to unravel mildly. If Lincoln had found a good balance between the president's personal life, political life, and life dealing with the war, we would have had ourselves a loaded movie that will push for the Best Picture prize. Instead, we have a movie that doubles-down heavily on politics and the maneuvers done to accomplish what Lincoln set out to do---while sacrificing a few key moments in the president's life. The ending in particular comes off as awkward because of the clunky catharsis and unique editing choices.After a slow start and a grand second act, Lincoln winds up mere inches from becoming one of the better movies of 2012 because it stumbles towards the end. Great performances and simplistically quality directing was marred by questionable editing choices and a final act that couldn't decide what ending to choose from. This most likely isn't the Lincoln film Spielberg wanted, but nearly crafted a diamond out of coal.A few Oscars are in place here, but Best Picture isn't one of them. Nonetheless, it's still an entertaining political drama that is sure to cement Day-Lewis and Spielberg as among the best in their proper craft.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
ARGUMENTS,"Lincoln, I personally think it was a decent move. Yeah if you're not that into politics you may not feel you would want to watch the movie, you may never consider watching a movie on something you don't like but this movie isn't a boring documentary it actually keeps you intrigued. Yes, at times I thought it was hard to keep up but hearing the different sides and seeing the argument helps you stay into it, for people who are into politics or not. The movie is much more than just politics though it kinda lets you see into their minds and see what all they were thinking. Me, who isn't that into politics, felt it was a movie that worded the arguments in a way where everyone could understand and comprehend what was being said. This is why the movie Lincoln, is I think the second to first movie we have watched this year.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""I have several advanced degrees and can handle didactic films"" - Captain Elite","It's an important film more than it's a good film. Steven Spielberg said while promoting the film: ""It's funny how the republicans and democrats have switched places since 1865.""
I don't think it is funny and it certainly isn't true. The democrats are still in favor of slavery and a society divided into ""elites"" and ""slaves"".
Democrats (slavery-jim crow-KKK-antifa-dependency-moral & financial bankruptcy - internment camps)
Republicans (defeated slavery in 1865 and then lost their spinal cord a few years later and have never regained it - they should've destroyed the party of evil and they didn't. And history will judge them harshly for that)
This movie does a good job of showing Lincoln as a man. It's easier and more fun to think of him as superhuman. Ya know why we think of him that way, because everyone else in comparison doesn't measure up. This movie helps you understand why that is true.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln similarities,"In my opinion, the movie ""Lincoln"" accurately portrays the end of slavery. There are, of course, some things in the movie that aren't true to history, but for the most part I would say it sums up the actual events that took place. ""The dramatic core of this remarkable four months of trying to pass the 13th amendment (which banned slavery) is true. Is every word true? No...but this is not a documentary"" (We Ask A Historian).One fact about the movie that is true to history is that Lincoln did actually often have a recurring dream before a major event. Lincoln often spoke of a mysterious dream about a ship, just like in the movie. However, Lincoln usually interpreted the dream as being not about the 13th amendment, but instead as being an omen of military victory (Lincoln Historical Accuracy). Either way, the dream excellently portrays what happened. Lincoln started war to save the Union, but freeing the slaves became a big purpose for him when he realized he could no longer move forward without a true understanding of liberty and union (We Ask A Historian). Therefore, freeing the slaves was a big motive of his, just like in the movie. The over-the-top drama from the House debates in the film also portrayed the debates in real life. Now in time, you don't really hear anything in the House anymore, but back then there was a much more active Congress.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Involving and compelling. There is so much more than just Day-Lewis' excellent performance.,"Firstly, let's face it, anything that can be said about Daniel Day- Lewis' performance has already been said. The fact is that he is one of the best actors of his generation, if not of all time and his tendency to be a picky bugger when it comes to taking film roles is to be respected, well maybe apart from Nine. His performance here is as committed as ever and utterly spellbinding, you do genuinely believe you are almost watching a reincarnation of the man himself on screen. One of the things that enhance the power of this performance is the very effective depiction of Abraham Lincoln's physicality. He was 6'4"" tall with long arms and legs, and Spielberg uses this to great effect as in every scene he always towers over everyone as I am sure he would have done in real life. It is also credit to Spielberg for not simply depicting Abraham Lincoln as a saint, his weaknesses and moments of self doubt are portrayed just as clearly as those that made him such a great man.I came into this film with a couple of fears: Firstly all I seemed to hear was praise for Day-Lewis' performance but very little else mentioned, a great performance does not necessarily make a great film. Also, for someone who knows only the basics of this period of American history like me, would this leave the film feeling alienating? Well, the film does actually boast a huge array of well known names in its cast such as Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Sally Field, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, John Hawkes, Jackie Earle Haley among others. Despite the nature of this being a character driven narrative, all these characters get their own individual moments to shine and all the actors excel with excellent performances. It is a credit to Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner that Day-Lewis does not appear in every scene, leaving other very important characters in this moment in history the chance to shine and for us the viewer to be made aware of their own very important individual contributions. It is fair to say that the dialogue is littered with constant wannabe Oscar speeches, however given the moment in history and the talent saying it, this is forgivable.That was the first fear resolved, now the second: There is no denying that Lincoln is effort and you are certainly required to concentrate especially as it is dialogue heavy throughout which certainly includes plenty of political jargon. However, after 15 or 20 minutes when it is established who everyone is, what their place is and what everyone is trying to achieve; Lincoln is a deeply involving and thoroughly gripping political drama. Abraham Lincoln's desperate bid to persuade people of great power to vote with him is gripping and compelling, even though we all know what the end result will be. What also adds to the involvement of the drama is that Spielberg lets characters that face a real life conflict when deciding how to vote have the screen time for us to genuinely understand their conflict and not just portray them as simply against Lincoln therefore bad people. This is a film which treats the viewers as intelligent people who clearly understand that in such a dramatic situation, things are never simple or straight forward. Anyone expecting the dramatic visual set pieces of previous Spielberg period dramas will be disappointed as this is a dialogue heavy film. It is definitely true that is not the most cinematic of films, and perhaps feels a little more like a television drama at times, but this is not a criticism as though the film is dialogue heavy, the narrative for me moved along at a quick pace as there is always something happening. Even John Williams' usually dominant music is very minimal.It is not until the final 20 minutes after the result we all know happens that Lincoln feels cinematic with sweeping music and dramatic outdoor scenes. However, for me it this last 20 minutes that severely lets this film down and does not need to be there at all, almost undoing all the good work in the preceding two hours. This may well sound like I am criticising Spielberg for basically being Spielberg, but the final 20 minutes is overblown cinematic schmaltz and sentimentality which is completely different from the dialogue heavy tone of the previous two hours. For me, this just did not need to be there, this is a film about a moment in history and one man paid a major contribution to that, it is not an arse licking biopic of Abraham Lincoln's life. However these last twenty minutes feel exactly like that. I of course do not want to spoil the ending, but we all know what happens afterwards to the President once peace is agreed and how it is portrayed here is embarrassingly cheesy, adding nothing to the compelling political drama we have just spent two hours watching. It almost feels like we have forgotten that we are watching a Spielberg film, The Beard has realised this and decided to remind us, and maybe trying to please the academy to make it a hat trick at the same time, very disappointing.For the first two hours Lincoln is a compelling and deeply involving political drama about an extremely important moment in history. An amazing central performance is also complimented by excellent supporting performances. It does require effort but this is amply rewarded, especially if you leave twenty minutes before the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln Review: How did Lincoln do it?,"""Four score and seven years ago..."" Famous words, some of the most famous words that have ever been spoken in human history. Spoken by a famous man with so many words in the history books. So much of what Abraham Lincoln did has ended up in the history books and yet very few ever really know him. They don't really understand what he did and how he did it. Figures in history often have that problem. We spend hours upon hours trying to figure them out and putting them in a modern context. What would they think of what we are doing today? How would they feel? What advice would they give to us about today's problems? Rarely though do we ever look at what they actually went through in their own time. The hardship and the struggle of every day life giving us the structure of what exists today.Which is not to say that the details aren't out there. Volumes upon volumes of text books are dedicated to these people and the lives that they led but we are always discovering new things about them. And that's because the context, both historical and emotional, can only really be understood with that often get lost over time as history moves forward. That is until the invention of film. With film, meant in broader cinematic terms rather than the physical medium, we can attempt to capture the reality of the struggle in a new and exciting way. Not to mention with technology and techniques being what they are today, the process of capturing it can be even more accurate and honest then ever before.As a result, we have a film like Lincoln. Directed by Steven Spielberg someone that many might consider a historical figure of the modern age, and starring Daniel Day Lewis, an actor who is on his way to becoming one of the best of the modern age if he isn't already. Through attention to detail and command performances by all involved, Lincoln paints a beautiful portrait of one of the most incredible and well known men in history. What makes the film even more remarkable is the fact that littered within the film are great lessons for the modern day. A nation divided by political and economic differences shows that little has changed in the past 100+ years and yet everything has changed.How did Lincoln do it? Even in seeing this film I'm not entirely sure because I am left with a sense of awe at the fact that he was able to accomplish anything at all. I am left with this same sense of awe after seeing this film. For all the ways in which Spielberg could have approached this film, he chose the most difficult way and yet the most relevant to modern times. Kudos to him for that.To check out more of my reviews, go here: http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Mostly good,"This historical drama takes place during the Civil War when U.S. president Abraham Lincoln is trying to end the war and also pass the constitutional amendment to end slavery.This film is a fine historical drama with a good share of wit, very good acting, and solid directing by stalwart Steven Spielberg. It breaks through the challenge of being two and a half hours with mostly political dialogue. This situation would make most films dull but there is never a dull moment in ""Lincoln"".The film and its lead performance by Daniel Day-Lewis have been winning overwhelming acclaim during this current awards season. While I would not criticize either, I believe this acclaim is rather over-rated.Probably no other actor could do better than Day-Lewis in this (or any other) role. He is very presidential in a calm and collected sort of way. The only moments of true intensity in the man are displayed more in family matters especially in discussions with his wife (very well played by Sally Field). ""Lincoln"" does not give Day-Lewis the chance to show the deeper dramatic side he showed a few years back in ""There Will Be Blood"" and a generation ago with ""My Left Foot"" and ""In the Name of the Father"" though he still gives a fine performance.Overall, the film is a fine dramatization of one of the most important times in U.S. history. It stays at a calm pace without much wavering. The only criticism would be the unusual choice of having a major dramatic event occur off-screen. Had it been depicted on-screen, it might have provided a welcome jolt.Another lost opportunity was that the viewer gets little glimpse of what the average American (both black and white) thought of the events passing before them. There was such a brief scene in the beginning but later the debates were strictly among politicians.This is a fine film overall but with some missed opportunities. - dbamateurcritic",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Splendiferous - hello, awards season.","Can anyone truly be surprised that Lincoln, starring the gifted Daniel Day-Lewis and directed by Steven Spielberg, is an out-of-the-park, instant classic? The movie was destined for success as soon as those two signed on, and do they ever deliver. Lincoln is a powerful, provocative, timely piece of art that is so well crafted that it diverts focus, as needed, from the president to the issues at hand - the potential end to the Civil War and the potential ratification of the 13th Amendment.The movie covers the time period of December 1864 until Lincoln's death in April 1865, with attention paid in equal amounts to the aforementioned national issues and the character of the 16th president himself, a tactful, down-home man who suppresses his emotions at the expense of his health. His is the most exasperating of dilemmas: should he agree to a peaceful accord with the confederates - and thus risk losing the fight against slavery for all time - or allow the bloodiest war to continue - and thus hope that the surrender would compel the defecting states to observe an amendment to abolish slavery? Ah, but of course there's even more to consider - would said amendment even pass? As more and more young men die each day, the decision becomes burdensome, almost Sisyphusian task.In 1865, it was the Republican Party that was anti-slavery, made up mostly of Northerners, with Democrats coming from the South. In order for the amendment to pass, all of Lincoln's Republicans would need to vote for it - plus a good number of Democrats. As today, lobbyists were deployed, by the Secretary of State (David Strathairn), to convince undecided politicians to vote for the amendment if and when it was presented for a vote. Meanwhile, the confederates are requested by a Lincoln emissary to travel from Richmond to Washington to talk - but will they arrive in time? And is this what the president truly wants?One thing is for certain: the machinations within political circles has not changed all that much. Secretary Seward attempts to woo some lame- duck senators with promises of jobs in Lincoln's new administration, but there are only so many jobs to go around. As these negotiations and overtures go on, the War Secretary (Bruce McGill) orders a massive attack on the rebels. Lincoln's own son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is frustrated by his father's refusal to allow him to enlist, and First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln (Sally Field) has tremendous mood swings and could well be mentally unstable.Standing tall above the fray is the inscrutable, yet vulnerable Lincoln himself. He sees his end and believes he can find the means to achieve it, but at what cost? See if this sounds familiar. One argument brought up by a senator against the abolition of slavery is that it would lead to Negros getting the right to vote, to be on the same ground as white folks. Topical, isn't it, with current talk about immigrants and their standing in our country. Lincoln himself puzzles over the ramifications, but he is convinced that he must first get the amendment passed and then worry about the consequences. Why? Here's a sneak-peak story. Lincoln wonders if we are born equal, if we are born for certain times or if we must fit into the times into which we are born. He even uses a Euclidean notion to prove a point, along with countless other stories with some sort of impetus behind them. This Abraham Lincoln is lawyer, teacher, thinker, philosopher, and father.Day-Lewis, as is his wont, disappears into the role. Imagine an Irishman playing an iconic American - preposterous! And yet there he is, plain as day, looking and sounding like he jumped out of the Oval Office in the 19th century. To say that his performance is terrific would be an astounding understatement. He breathes Lincoln, gradually allowing us to see various layers of the character.But we have come to expect that from Daniel Day-Lewis, haven't we? What about Sally Field, though? Let's think about this. Sally Field is 66, 20 years older than Mary Todd was in 1865; she's only 10 years older than Day-Lewis. Can we accept her as his wife and not his mother? A resounding yes. Field hits her role hard, with raw emotion and guts, toning down the First Lady's infamous histrionics. For the past couple of decades she's done a lot of television and few big-screen roles. This may change things, oh it just might. Sally Field has just proved that an actress of certain talent can play younger. She's not just a plausible Mary Todd, she's Mary Todd incarnate.Their supporting cast is filled with familiar faces, with not a slouch to be found. Hal Holbrook. James Spader. Strathairn. McGill. John Hawkes. Jackie Earle Haley. Gordon-Levitt. And a dour, bewigged Tommy Lee Jones. Spielberg doesn't mess around when it comes to casting epic masterpieces, does he?Lincoln is a hit, from beginning to tragic end, thanks to...well, everyone. It's the kind of film that makes you forget you're in a dark room with strange people. It's the kind of film that makes you think you're standing in the balcony of the Capitol, watching the proceedings. It's deliciously detailed and does not shy away from the grisly results of the wars between men.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Best hour of sleep I've had for a long time,"I used to pride myself on being someone that would stay until the very end of any movie.'I know what you did last Summer', stayed till the end. 'Breaking Dawn - Part 2', stayed till the end. Fair enough i popped out for a smoke a couple of times but I was back for the ending so herself wouldn't get too annoyed. 'Django', felt like getting sick a couple of times but stayed till the end.Anyways, if you're looking for a biography on one of America's most influential, most quoted and possibly most respected President than this movie isn't for you.It's largely about the 13th amendment to the constitution of the United States. It involves very little 'action' considering the civil war that was being fought at the time and although it does touch on Lincoln's rise from rags and his personal family lose it doesn't go much further than just mentioning it in one or two lines of dialogue.I had some misconceptions going into the cinema on this one. I thought a movie called 'Lincoln' would be...well, about Lincoln. It's not. It's 150 minutes of debating, back-handers, political threats and frankly talk!D.D.Lewis does an excellent job with what he has.

Sir Daniel Day-Lewis' Well Deserved Third Academy Award!,"Sir Daniel Day Lewis was well awarded for playing sixteenth American President Abraham Lincoln. The film is based on Presidential Scholar Doris Kearns Goodwin's award winning novel, ""Team of Rivals."" Spielberg does a brilliant job in recreating history which is not always an easy task. Sally Field was a wise choice to play Mary Todd Lincoln. Sure they could have casted a younger actress but I'm glad that Sally got another chance at a third Oscar.

Lincoln movie needs more Lincoln,"Lincoln is a movie with a rather disappointing flaw: it's not actually about Lincoln. This movie, which purports to tell the story of this iconic man, is not about the man at all. It is a movie about the process of getting an amendment through Congress. Two and a half hours of that unsurprisingly leads to quite a bit of boredom. Abraham Lincoln led such a fascinating life. None of that fascinating stuff makes it into the movie. Instead Steven Spielberg focuses solely on the last four months of Lincoln's life, focuses on just one of the many accomplishments of this great President. Yes, the passage of the 13th Amendment which abolished slavery is hugely important. But the story of the amendment's passage is not nearly enough to sustain a movie of this length. There has to be more to the story. A movie about the life of Abraham Lincoln would never be boring, would never fail to captivate. Unfortunately this is not that movie.The best thing the movie has going for it is undoubtedly the stellar performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as Lincoln. Such a shame then that so much of the movie is spent away from the President, following others working on his behalf to get the amendment passed. This Lincoln movie desperately needs more Lincoln. It quickly becomes a movie more about political machinations than any sort of biography. And Congressional procedure does not make for a particularly interesting movie. Other actors, most notably Tommy Lee Jones as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, do their best. The movie is very well-acted, everyone in the enormous cast does a fine job. But you don't go into a movie titled Lincoln hoping to see some nice supporting performances. You go into it to see Lincoln. And the wonderful performance of Day-Lewis is largely wasted as there just isn't enough for him to do. The narrow focus of the film robs us of the opportunity to really see the story of this great man. Day-Lewis could have done so much with this role if given the chance to truly cover the breadth of Lincoln's life. A tremendous opportunity missed. In the end Spielberg has produced not a bad movie but surely a very frustrating one. You go into this movie hoping to really get to know Abraham Lincoln. You don't get to know him at all. Instead you learn more than you could ever want to know about how Congress works. There's a reason nobody makes movies about the House of Representatives.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
One of the finest historical films ever.,"History has told us Lincoln is responsible for abolishing slavery, but it's the exasperating hardships and personal sacrifices that forever altered the landscape and direction of this country. Making the amendment battle the cornerstone of the story reveals Lincoln as a simple man, yet equally complex. As the civil war rages on, Lincoln struggles with the carnage on the battlefield, as well as the conflict within his own cabinet pertaining to the Thirteenth Amendment. Spielberg wisely focuses the last three months of Lincoln's life, and his own crisis of conscience between ending the war or slavery. If you're not entirely sure why Lincoln is universally regarded as one of the greatest U.S. presidents going into this movie, you'll have no doubts by the time it's over.Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't just play Lincoln--he inhabits him. It's a remarkable performance that won another Oscar for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role for Day-Lewis. With his Oscar winning performance as Lincoln, he became the sixth performer to win more than two Academy Awards, and the first male performer to win three awards for lead roles. Impressive secondary performances abound as well. Sally Field, as Lincoln's unstable wife, delivers a marvelous performance, as does Tommy Lee Jones as the fiery, passionate Thaddeus Stevens. ""Lincoln"" is an authentic, visual masterpiece--reproducing and portraying the landscape and atmosphere of the 19th century in extraordinary detail. The incredible performances receive most of the notoriety, and rightfully so, but the production values and set design are simply stunning. Jim Erickson (set decorator) and Rick Carter (production designer) both won Oscars for Best Achievement in Production Design.One requirement upon seeing ""Lincoln"" is you must commit yourself to two and a half hours of laborious dialog and monologues, from a litany of characters encompassing a variety of topics. A major challenge Spielberg had to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period--and fitting it into a structured, disciplined film. Throughout the film, there are an abundance of subtleties that can easily go unnoticed, and the demanding content of the film's script makes this a challenging picture to watch.That being said, ""Lincoln"" belongs to the ages, and is one of the finest historical films ever made. Steven Spielberg's landmark motion picture enriches the American canon - freeing the Great Emancipator from his tintype image in our history books, and explores the wit and wisdom that made the man.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Lincoln💯,This movie was decent. Wasn't as good as the other movies I have seen. This movie was different from the others I have seen. I did understand the plot and story about Lincoln getting the 13th Amendment passed to abolish slavery but the thing I don't get is he could just try to convince them more about why they should pass this amendment. I do understand why the amendment should be passed and all but why did it take so long? But the thing that shocked me the most was the dude secretly having a relationship with his house wife and it made sense why he would want the amendment passed. But one final thing i didn't see was how Lincoln got shot.,7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"The Oscar race has just begun, but it's already all but over.","It may be premature to say, but I think the Oscar race is already over.""Lincoln,"" Steven Spielberg's latest opus which focuses on the final four months of Abraham Lincoln's life, the focal point being his greatest accomplishment, the abolishment of slavery in the United States in January of 1865 and the end of the Civil War, has every element imaginable to render it possibly unbeatable for a slew of Golden statuettes.First and foremost, there is Daniel Day-Lewis in the title role. His transformation into America's 16th President is, for lack of a better word, uncanny. I would not for an instant lay claim to knowing very much about the Lincoln in any way, shape or form, but Lewis embodies every detail that I feel I have ever learned about this iconic political figure. From his speech patterns to his physicality, I could not imagine a better performance than what Lewis displays in every single frame he is in. Already a two-time Oscar winner (""My Left Foot"" in 1990, ""There Will be Blood"" in 2008), winning Best Actor in 2013 is truly his award to lose.And then there is the rest of the cast, each one possibly looking at some recognition by the Academy.Sally Field, also a two-time Oscar winner for ""Norma Rae"" in 1980 and again in 1984 for ""Places in the Heart"" could very well be looking at her third nomination and possibly a win as Mary Todd Lincoln. Her performance as the emotionally tortured and completely supportive wife is absolutely magnificent.Then there are the supporting players....the members of the House, those who helped Lincoln gain voted to pass the 13th amendment. Tommy Lee Jones, almost guaranteed his fourth Oscar nomination (he won in 1994 for ""The Fugitive""), brings his A game as Thaddeus Stevens, one of the most outspoken Republicans from the area who fought tooth and nail for equality and was one of the greatest proponents of the 13th Amendment. David Strathairn, also an Oscar nominee (""Good Night and Good Luck"") as William Seward, the Secretary of State who initially fought against the amendment while remaining loyal to his Commander in Chief. Golden Globe nominee James Spader as W.N Bilbo who was sent out to recruit Democratic votes by any means possible. Oscar nominee Hal Holbrook (""Into the Wild"") as Preston Blair, one of Lincoln's faithful advisors. Oscar nominee Jackie Earle Haley (""Little Children"") as Alexander Stevens, the vice president to the Confederacy. Even Golden Globe and Emmy nominee Lee Pace, best known for his role in ""Pushing Daisies"" offers an exceptional turn as Fernando Wood, one of the staunchest opponents to the slavery amendment. Even smaller roles by the likes of Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Lincoln's son and Gloria Reuben as one of Lincoln's attendants are more than worthy of noting and praise. John Hawkes is also featured in this film in an excellent performance, but he will be overlooked here, as he will already be looking at a Best Actor nomination for his role in ""The Sessions."" Then there is the writing. Written by the magnificent Tony Kushner, who is not only yet another Oscar nominee for his script for ""Munich"" but who also wrote the near-perfect Emmy-winning ""Angels in America,"" Kushner's script plays out in brilliant fashion, not only capturing the language and the feel of the era, but also manages to capture the audience while giving what could have been a long-winded history lesson thanks to a perfect blend of drama and humour.All this under the direction of Spielberg (do I bother mentioning his Oscars, too?)? ""Lincoln"" is nothing short of a historical masterpiece.It was fascinating to watch the debate on slavery wage on in the House, hearing people's fear that the abolishment of slavery could lead to blacks and women being able to vote and, oh the horror, possibly enter politics! And to think that all this was done by those crazy, ""radical"" Republicans. Who would have thought that a hundred years later, the tables would have completely turned on these parties with the Democrats being the party who fights for equality and the mere thought of denying women and ANY minority the right to vote would be ludicrous.And yet, the needless debate of allowing two men or two women to marry rages on in the United States.Let's hope Mr. Obama may find a way to be a modern-day Lincoln.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Turned exciting politics into melodramatic mush...,"The acting is absolutely terrific in this film, there's no denying that. However, this is where my praise ends for Spielberg's film.The passing of the 13th amendment was one of the most conflicting and exciting moments in American political history. So what does Spielberg do with the story? He fills it with shots of Lincoln staring out the window, staring at the floor, walking around, arguing with his family.The film however should not be called 'Lincoln' but more 'The 13th Amendment"" because that is what the film is about! We learn nothing about Lincoln 'the man' except that he was an intelligent man (which I believe we all assumed anyway).The most disappointing aspect of the film for me, was when Abe got shot. We suddenly hear ""THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN SHOT!"" There was no build up, nor a scene to show what happened. I feel like of all the scenes to leave out of a film, he left out one of the most important ones. I understand it may disturb people, but this is what happened!

Creating History,"Lincoln is not entirely the whole biography of Abraham Lincoln. It's not about his life, nor how he became a president but it is the story how he became a great one. It features no origin or back stories. Its central focus is when he fought against slavery. One might not expect it to be a two hour film of lecturing and making decisions. Some might not enjoy it in that way but if you have the right mind and the heart to know the history then you'll get an interesting experience. With a bold direction and a remarkable performance from a brilliant actor, what possibly could go wrong? It's still surprisingly talky but it is also surprisingly engrossing.The film's story for Abraham Lincoln is how he became a remarkable President. The film didn't gloss at the honest man. He'll always be the one who's having a hard time, surrounded by complicated decisions. He's never portrayed as perfect. He's just like anyone else, except he's wiser and acts like a father to anyone. He sometimes tells stories and such. The film may not show his childhood or anything in his past but you can see what kind of man he is. When it talks about the history, it serves an easy narration, but complexity displays when everybody inside is shouting out their opinions at each other.Aside all, it spends most of the time discussing in places. It sometimes feels Shakespearean. The first act is a little slow for some reason, but the entertainment rises in every sequence. It gets a lot more interesting in the courtroom scenes. The performances brings some excitement. Every scene with Tommy Lee Jones in the court is difficult to ignore. It's a terribly striking performance, but the best performance is, of course, Daniel Day-Lewis who is, without a doubt, fantastic as Abraham Lincoln. It's totally fascinating performance that anyone would feel he's the real Lincoln himself. The rest are fantastic as well for spicing up everything else.The film is almost a series of meetings. Outside the conversations, we get to see the tragedies going around and Lincoln's personal life, while he's handling his family's issues and the nation's struggle. Steven Spielberg may take an impressive new direction for the film, but his trademark drama elements still fills in the gravity moments. He never leaves his original style behind. In the filmmaking side, the production and the cinematography gives a spectacular look at the scenes.The title, Lincoln, doesn't refer as the entire life of Abraham Lincoln. It's all about how the name ""Lincoln"" became famous and memorable throughout history because of one legend's remarkable achievement. The film shows a rather interesting way of portraying its history. It mostly explores inside the Civil War with politicians fighting their decisions. It may not be the usual type of entertainment for some, but seriously, it's all about the history and the film never backs away from that. Lincoln is generally thought-provoking and mesmerizing by its strong dialogue, and brilliant direction and performances, added with magnificent filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Could have seen less of son Tad and more of wife's insanity...she was a real piece of work. Do not understand complaints of Lincoln's high pitch voice. I've never read anything of him speaking in deep, resonant tones. DD-L captivated me. He certainly will be nominated for an Oscar...probably losing to Hugh Jackman's Les Mis Jean Valjean.Perhaps I'm too much of a history buff and was over enamored by the period brought to life better than in the past.

Producers should learn: viewers want more films like this,"Having seen Spielberg's Lincoln film Thanksgiving afternoon, I'd like to comment on the president's war powers, which ""Lincoln"" said he wasn't sure of, which is incorrect. First, a president's powers as commander-in-chief are implemented under the 1795 Act of Insurrection. Secondly as Anna Ella Carroll, Lincoln's legal adviser wrote, given that the Confederate government had imposed itself upon the Southern people, the Confederacy could be treated as a defacto belligerent (read: foreign) government. Under the doctrine of military necessity, slaves could be freed as a temporary war measure to prevent their public use to provide material aid to the Confederate Army. Carroll was the first to write publicly on war powers and her two major pamphlets ""The War Powers of the General Government"" and ""The Relation of the National Government to the Revolted Citizens Defined"" were partly financed by the War Dept. and distributed widely in Washington, D. C. and the Border States. My definitive biography of Carroll, Great Necessities: The Life, Times, and Writings of Anna Ella Carroll, 1815-1894 reprints these. Also see and join www.friendsofannaellacarroll.org Otherwise, kudos to Mr. Spielberg et al. for a superb movie, and to Mr. Lewis, for the best portrayal of Lincoln ever. The main topic of the passage of the 13th Amendment is one I'm not familiar with in detail. Brilliant idea. The script was dense and a chef d'oeuvre in and of itself. I do wish, however, for less reality in lighting. I know gas lighting was not very bright, but with all those beards, and a number of male characters, it'd be nice to get clearer images to keep the players straight. This is a serious film, not dumbed down. As a matter of fact to catch its full implications, one would have to see it more than once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"""If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong.""","With all the praise and accolades Stephen Spielberg's latest film received, I was compelled to watch Lincoln and see for myself how great it is.The film definitely has its bright spots. History buffs might relate to the film the best; those who actually take an interest in the politics, the history, and the characters involved. The film seems to do decent justice to everything. A few scenes stand out, and the dialogue is quite sharp (although it is quite old-fashioned as well).The main problem is, this film is a long and slow-moving affair, built entirely on politics and dialogue. There's maybe a minute of war scenes in the opening shot, but from then on, it's straight-up talking. The vast majority of the film takes place in the White House, or in Congress, or in some other indoors setting, with very little variation. Conflict is strictly political; people struggling to get the 13th Amendment ratified, and lots of debating ensues. If the political battle for the 13th Amendment is something that really interests you, then maybe this film will speak to you. For me, however, I found it quite dry, and I found myself nodding off and losing interest on a few occasions.In spite of that, I think the actual plot of this film is thin and flat, lacking in significant conflict or structure. The best that can be said is that it's populated with quality characters, who seem to adhere to historical depiction and fact quite well. I was relieved to see that the actual political stance of the film is appropriately neutral; the film never slanders or puts a spin on Republicans or Democrats, but portrays them objectively. With the 13th Amendment as the sole subject of the film, the film digs up a lot of themes to reinforce Lincoln's ideals of equality and freedom.As expected, the cinematography and editing are top-notch. Acting is effectively perfect, especially from Daniel Day Lewis, who provides an appropriately nuanced and enjoyable portrayal of Abraham Lincoln. Writing is excellent, especially in the way it provides sharp and witty dialogue, with a proper 1860s style. This production has great-looking sets, props, and costumes. Music is not bad either.Watching this film reminded me a lot of watching JFK, but without the conspiracy theories or freakiness. Both films are basically political to the core, and I find them both rather tedious to watch. Regardless, Lincoln is a well-crafted film, and is definitely worth watching. Recommended, especially for history buffs, fans of political dramas, and fans of the cast or the director.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Marginal | Story: Average | Film: Perfect)",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Daniel Day-Lewis is a miracle!,"I have admired Daniel-Day Lewis since he blew the world away in My Left Foot. He blows me away as much here, probably for the fact that he looks and acts so much like the Abraham Lincoln every true American knows from photos, writings, and historical accounts. He is an amazing actor with a way to just absorb away until all there is left is another person. I felt as I watched him that I was in the room with Abraham Lincoln-- not a caricature or an impersonation, but the man himself. Even more impressive as an Irishman! The only foreigner to do as well with an American persona was the great Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara!Obviously the performance is Oscar material but I must say as much as I love his work that the Best Actor Award should go to Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean in Les Mis. That was just a plain tour-de-force! (how appropriately French)I remember Sally Field since she was The Flying Nun!!! So she is like an old friend to me. I admire her earthiness and ability to also dissolve away and let the character live through her.I would highly suggest a review of your Civil War history before watching this movie, because unless you understand the politics you will be bored quickly, no matter how good the acting and replication of dialogue, costumes and scenery pertinent to a period piece!

An informing look at Abraham Lincoln's final days that's elevated by excellent performances.,"Lincoln is Steven Spielberg's best film since Munich (2005). For Lincoln he assembled a terrific cast, one of the best ever. The film is full of dialogue, a result of Tony Kushner's rich screenplay. Because of this Lincoln doesn't even seems like one of Spielberg's films. It doesn't have his typical thrills and action. In fact, it seems very much like a theater play. Daniel Day-Lewis's impressive performance was singled out by some critics as one worthy of a Best Actor Academy Award, but Day-Lewis is only the first among equals here. Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, a fervent abolitionist, has some of the best lines in the film. Sally Field as the grieving Mary Todd Lincoln is at the center of the film's dramatic subplot. Both Jones and Field deserve an Academy Award for their performances. James Spader as Republican Party operative William N. Bilbo steals every scene he's in. Other famous names in the cast include David Strathairn, Hal Holbrook, Jackie Earle Haley, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Jared Harris. Day-Lewis made his Lincoln a fully-realized and likable character. When he's talking one can't help but listen to his every word. The film covers the final four months of Abraham Lincoln's life, focusing on his efforts in January 1865 to have the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution pass the United States House of Representatives. Slavery and war are the two issues here. It's made clear that it took a lot of effort to abolish slavery in the United States. The film presents arguments in favor and against slavery, though it's not a detailed look at American politics of that time. In addition, it seems like an idealized look at American politics. The Civil War was a war between the industrial North against the agrarian South. Seeing Lincoln is really like a trip back in time because the sets and the costumes are very good. In conclusion, the film is easily worth recommending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

I have to admit it did not let me down at all and may have actually been better then I was hoping for.

Spielberg could not have chosen a better cast, all the actors were totally believable. What comes across for me is how difficult it is to rally people to a cause, how difficult great leadership is. Lincoln had drive, a sense of humour and a belief that he could succeed. Needless to say his family paid a terrible price. The world needs great leaders!",8.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Strong acting but a bit slow,"The movie Lincoln demonstrates some superb acting all around. The movie portrays the few months before the end of the civil war and Lincoln's efforts to abolish slavery.It's a hard film for modern folks to watch because of the speed with which stuff happens. Lincoln spends time talking to his cabinet, to people, to soldiers, to politicians, to his kids. The movie demonstrates his unique political skills, and his efforts to abolish slavery at all costs. But all that movies along a bit slowly, compared to the internet speed pace of today.Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic as Lincoln. His voice, cadence, mannerisms, walk, and look really put you in Lincoln's shoes. Sally Field delivers a strong performance as his wife who really gives him back all he can take. My favorite though was James Spader, who assists in getting votes for Lincoln's initiatives. He is a hoot to watch. On the other hand, I did not enjoy Tommy Lee Jones, who seemed a bit over the top as a major liberal within the Republican party.The costumes and scenery were also very realistic, adding to the mood perfectly. If not for the pace, and the somewhat inevitable Hollywood ending, I would have enjoyed this movie even more. Still, it's a strong film with superb acting and a terrific cast.

This Lincoln Is Far Better Than Any Myth,"The poet John Godfrey Saxe wrote a few years after the Civil War, ""Laws, like sausages, cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made."" This comparison between laws and sausages is no more evident than in Steven Spielberg's ""Lincoln"" an ambitious film about the principal problem facing the president, i.e., what would be the fate of the millions of slaves in the reconstructed Union. Spielberg succeeds in turning the art of negotiating into an entertaining motion picture. Lincoln the master politician and therefore a master in the art of the possible is magnificently recreated by Daniel Day Lewis whose brilliance is once again confirmed in a performance that should receive Oscar consideration. There's an outstanding supporting cast including Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln, David Strathairn as Secretary Seward, Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Robert Lincoln, Hal Holbrook as an influential Republican whose support Lincoln needs and Tommy Lee Jones as Radical Republican Thaddeus Stevens. Tony Kushner's adapted screenplay is a masterful imagining of Lincoln the country lawyer who possessed political genius that few understood at the time. It is beautifully photographed by Janusz Kaminski, edited by Michael Kahn and scored by John Williams. A first class production all the way and one that will certainly dispose of any comfortable notions people may have that past generations possessed some great wisdom and courage that far supersedes anything we see in Washington today. As it says in Ecclesiastes, ""there is nothing new under the sun"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Well-Made but Boring as Heck,"Lincoln follows Abraham Lincoln as he attempts to give freedom to black people during the last four months while he was president.The plot is fine. It's very much a political movie, and it wasn't horribly interesting to me. It's presentation isn't great though. As a whole it's well-made, but it's just so boring. It often uses dark colors for no other reason that I can find other than to put the audience to sleep. I think that the same story could have been told in less than 150 minutes, considering how much of the movie I thought was entirely pointless. As soon as the climax finished I was ready to fall asleep, even more so than the rest of the movie. I saw no reason to continue, and yet I did, and every last minute droned on and on until it finally ended 30 minutes later.The characters are decent. Most of them aren't too interesting, but that's just thanks to the pacing, so it's hard to care when it's so hard to pay attention. Abraham Lincoln himself is the most interesting character. Danial Day-Lewis does a great job playing him. He's consistent in both the way he talks and the way he moves. The other actors were all just fine, but most of them were barely as important as Lincoln himself. The list of secondary characters would actually be pretty long, considering the only character who consistently and often shows up is Lincoln himself.Overall Lincoln is well-made with a good lead actor and character, but it's far too boring to fully appreciate. I found myself rewinding on multiple occasions because I'd doze off or zone out and have no idea what was going on. Maybe I was just in the wrong mindset, I don't know, but I won't be watching it again any time soon. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Review - Lincoln,"Anybody searching for a biography film about Abraham Lincoln's full life and ""major"" events will have to look elsewhere. Steven Spielberg's Lincoln (which I saw in the theater over Thanksgiving weekend) has a brief battle scene at the beginning, and a few scenes near the end taking place around (and during) the time of the assassination, but most of the film (and the meat of the film) is confined to January 1865, and is about Lincoln striving to get the 13th amendment to the Constitution (banning slavery) passed.If you ask me, limiting the time frame of the film like this was a very smart decision. Showing all the major events of his life is not necessary; this film, with its shorter time frame, does a great job at it. In fact, I would go as far as to say that it does a better job of it than a traditional bio-pic would. The film doesn't really want to show his life, but rather paint a true portrait of the man himself; who was he, really, as a person, president, etc.? The film is restricted mostly (although not entirely) to offices, courtrooms, Capitol chambers, and places like that, but it still does a very good job at portraying the time period, visually, politically, and in every other way, and with good detail. In fact, while I generally don't find politics interesting or appealing, I actually found the political aspect of this film somewhat interesting.Another major factor that makes the film work so well is the acting. Daniel Day-Lewis put on an excellent performance as Abraham Lincoln; deep, dynamic, powerful, and very convincing. In fact, his performance is what I liked best about the entire film. He didn't just portray Lincoln, he practically was Lincoln. He was pretty convincing in terms of physical appearance, but more importantly, he was almost perfect in terms of his character (in other words, becoming Lincoln). In short, Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of Lincoln is great and unforgettable, and completely Oscar-worthy (and he may actually win). All of the other actors (including Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) also put their best foot forward and deliver very good and convincing performances. They slip right into and bring out their characters.Steven Spielberg has delivered again. He has directed several films that I like, some of them nostalgic favorites. He has made many different types of films, all across the genre spectrum; sci-fi, adventure, war, fantasy, history, serious films, fun films, etc etc. He's not perfect, and not all of his films are good, but, again, a lot of them are, and Lincoln is one such film, and one in which he again proves that he can make just about any type of film. In my opinion it's still not as good as some of his best films, like Schindler's List and War Horse, but it's still great. And once again, Spielberg has teamed up with score composer John Williams. Williams's score isn't anywhere near as good or memorable as a lot of his previous works, but it's still pretty good and it fits the film very well.All in all, the film is not perfect, and it actually only scraped a full 10 from me by a little bit. It could have been better in some aspects, even some of its better aspects, but it's still a great film. Great performances, great historical portrayal, etc. In fact, if I had to label one film about Lincoln the definitive film about him, it would probably this one. The film brought me closer to the real-life figure of Lincoln than I have ever been before (literature, pictures, documentaries, etc.). I wouldn't be surprised if this film ends up being used in school and college history courses.Lincoln is compelling and moving, and a film truly worthy of its title; it paints an excellent portrait of America's sixteenth president.My Rating: **** (out of ****)For more reviews, please visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
It's like a Lincoln documentary,"Lincoln has always been very interesting because of his physical, type, clothing, and also what he did.

A totally Worth-It movie,"I had to go through some articles regarding the 13th Amendment and the Civil War in order to get along with this movie. But seriously, this movie was worth the trouble I took. The last months of the great legend has been narrated so beautifully, that I realized why Steven Spielberg will always remain a great director. This is hes best biopic since Schindler's List. The movie follows a steady pace, and has a really good turn at every edge of it.In such a beautifully shot movie,. the next amazing factor is none other Daniel Day Lewis. But he is never their i the movie, it is all about Lincoln. Robert DeNiro was the next who baffled me. Great casting indeed.To feel the depth of a man who could change the world single handed, and to hold the key role in abolishing slavery, man, I respected the legend, and the crew behind this awesome movie. A great watch indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Felt like a propaganda reel extolling the virtues of American democracy,"Altogether this was a decent movie. I can see why Americans who've been taught all about the Civil War and how wonderful and great Lincoln was might thoroughly enjoy this movie.But for the remaining 7 billion of us on this planet this was a bit of a yawn. While getting a constitutional amendment to pass is exciting fare in the US, those of us who have not already been thoroughly suffused with this aspect of American history are, like, whatever.Too slow paced. For example, for a 2.5 hour movie it could've shown us a bit more of the Civil War to spice things up (rather than just some burning buildings and corpses strewn about). I guess Spielberg and producers wanted this to be exclusively a hagiography about Lincoln, but I'm sure there are already lots of American high school history textbooks for that. C'mon! Give us some explosions and gun battles and boom-boom-pow!And finally, for the 7 billion of us who don't think the US is the greatest country on the planet, a lot of the movie felt like a cheesy propaganda reel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Exceptional Performances - Lincoln and the Abolition of Slavery are Distinctly American,"There's a scene in the movie Lincoln where Daniel Day-Lewis, as the 16th US President, asks his communication aides about their perspective on leadership. ""Do you think we choose the times into which we are born?,"" Daniel Day-Lewis, as Abraham Lincoln, asks two young workers in the telegraph office. This question, of course, makes Abraham Lincoln a compelling leader and an American character for the ages. He is as important to American history as Julius Ceasar is to the story of Rome. As we know, in retrospect, someone in the course of American history had to tackle the evil bondage of slavery and the scourge it continues to imprint on our nation's legacy. Lincoln's biography presents an unlikely leader, but his vision of a nation free of slavery was relentless. Daniel Day Lewis is exceptional in his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln. It goes without saying, this Spielberg movie is a classic. There are no embellishments whatsoever in the plot. Lincoln was driven to pass the 13th Amendment before the South surrendered, regardless of what it cost which, of course, was the root cause of his violent death by gun violence at Ford's Theater in Washington DC on April 15, 1865. It would be ideal if this movie were required viewing for all Americans; but, especially for politicians, who face the challenging decisions of their times. Other exceptional performances include Tommy Lee Jones as Congressman Thaddeus Stevens and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln. My hope is for ""Lincoln"" to take its place as one of the greatest American movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
"Interesting, but not as a late night watch.","I picked this film up because of its great cast, but knowing it wouldn't treat my favourite subject, nor would it be my favourite type of late night watch. And I was right, since I'm not into politics (and even less into history), I inevitably fount it boring, punctuated by interesting/funny parts -for sure- but still too long and dull. I have to admit it was amazingly well made, played (Daniel Day Lewis AND David Strathairn? Can't ask for more) and shot, plus the music and the costumes were perfectly adapted to the situation. An overall really good film, but only if you enjoy learning about politics and/or history. Still much better than picking up your copybooks to revise your history programme, believe me!",6.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Seems there is a missing 'Link' in Lincoln,"Spielberg ticked me off once again. This movie is very boring - even more so for the viewers like me who are unfamiliar with the detailed history preceding Lincoln's death. In fact, the whole >2 hours film was dedicated extensively to an event that involved political plays and nothing else. I have to say, at the end of the movie I don't feel much for the characters including Lincoln and the nation's civilians (the soldiers, the slaves who benefited from the amendment, or Lincoln's close friends and families) because that is how imperfect this movie turned out to be. The movie doesn't deserved to be given such a title as I still do not know much who Lincoln really was - his childhood, how he met his wife, more light on the family life? These were either non-existent or not elaborated enough.Speaking of his wife, now I do not know if her depiction was accurate, but her role in the film only made the whole movie experience worse with her constant blabbering typical of a near control-freak housewife. Sally Field acted well befitting the demand of her role, but it doesn't save the film overall. Lincoln himself blabbers a lot too, and I wont blame it on the huge mouthful of dialogue which I assumed is the intended style of the film. So many things that were being uttered by him were pure gibberish coming from an accomplished politician and country leader, in contrast to some of the supporting characters who said things that made more sense. But I would commend a great performance from Daniel Day Lewis despite all the irritating flaws mentioned.",5.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
DDL is a master craftsman and his craft is acting,"Just like any master woodworker who makes amazing sculptures out of wood or an ice sculpter out of ice and it being flawless, Daniel Day-Lewis does the same thing with his craft being acting. He doesn't just make you see DDL doing a good impersonation of Abraham Lincoln, he literally becomes the 16th President of the United States. You don't see any of the personality traits that DDL had in any of previous great performances such as Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood. The same man who awed you with his portrayal of Daniel Plainview will do the same thing here as Honest Abe.The supporting cast also has an A List cast of actors with such notables as Sally Field, David Strathairn, Tommy Lee Jones, Jackie Earl Haley, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and even Walton Goggins from Justified and The Shield fame.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Captivating political drama,"This film deftly navigates the early political landscape. The focus is on the passing of the 13th amendment, which abolished slavery. Unlike typical biopics, this film focuses primarily on the political negotiations and maneuvers behind the scenes, rather than slowly focus on Lincoln.There's an attention to detail that only Speilberg can give. Everything is fully immersive in the world of the 1860s. Lincoln is made human, with small moments with his family and interactions with troops that show a different side to him, not seen in historical speeches.This is a must see, though you need to be ready to think and follow along with politics. If your mind wanders, it'll be hard to catch back up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Exceptional Production!,"This was truly an amazing film about an amazing member of our human race. Lincoln (the film) remained on point though it could have run down many trails that would have diminished the value of its main character. My wife and I are somewhat knowledgeable of Lincoln's historical story which helps digest some of the film's content. We were both blown away and found ourselves holding back our emotions frequently throughout the film. I did take note of some audience members critiquing the film for its selection of cast and artistic value. I would suggest that if you attend you do so out of an appreciation of history and an interest in the story of an amazing human being, fitted for his time and selflessly sacrificing so much for our nation. It also proved that Congress has evolved little in the past one and a half centuries! This was the best motion picture experience of my 50 years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Lincoln Comes to Life,"Painstakingly, historically accurate portrayal of the last months of Lincoln's life. This film is a wonderful history lesson for anyone over the age of 12. Even if you have studied Lincoln and read about him and his age, you will get to know him in a way that reading alone can't provide.Lincoln is shown as more than just a homespun country lawyer, but a passionate man of beliefs and an accomplished politician. He knows that in order to pass an amendment banning slavery, he is going to have to grease more than a few palms, and he does so. Daniel Day Lewis's portrayal if the definitive one of all the actors who have played Lincoln. Lincoln knew by the end of the war that slavery must be abolished once and for all permanently. The House followed the Senate in passing the 13th amendment, but it was a close thing and could have gone the other way without the right leadership.The sets, the actors, the attention to the smallest details of the period make this movie a treasure.",10.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
How They Handled Lincoln And Slavery,"Lincoln believes that passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution - which would abolish slavery. He was going to get votes from the Republicans, and getting the Democrates which may require some compromise in other parts of the constitution. The Confederates make negotiation conditional on Lincoln's written assurance that the Thirteenth Amendment will not be ratified. Lincoln responds that all the northern states will ratify it, and he has assurances that at least three Confederate states will do to the Union, which was suppose to be the end to slavery. They handled Lincoln's perspective on slavery well, as he was going for the midground to only abolish slavery in certain areas to prevent mass damage to the South, while helping out the North.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Unpopular opinion about Lincoln: a story by popandcrackcorn,"Steven Spielberg's Lincoln was awful, and it needs to be said. So bring it on all you nerdy trolls and TAs for any history professor at any community college. I have very little fear of deleting comments, but please only rebloggers are allowed to continue ahead.I'll begin with a question. You loved Tommy Lee Jones in Lincoln, right? He was fantastic and really controlled a heavy moment in the film, though only having a small amount of actual screen time. He was interesting and wise and really made us feel strong for our country. Jones' character showed the power of America's negotiation process at its finest, and we love that scene and how great he was. So then tell me, what his character's name?You have no idea, and I'll tell you why. It's because Abraham Lincoln was the most dominant character of an entire era, and so prolific that he's considered one of the greatest men (who we have pictures of) in history. But the film didn't give us time to identify with that character at all, mainly because Spielberg skipped right into a certain section of his life. They took a legend whose history every American knows intimately, and made his character as closeted as K.C. Armstrong (baba booey, baba booey). So right off, the viewer loses the connection between the main focus and interest of the film.Also the movie is like C-Span boring, which sucked as Lincoln had such potential. It was one of the most anticipated films of the year, directed by the greatest director of our lifetime and about one of the most important historical icons of our era, while being portrayed by one of the greatest actors of our lifetime. It should've be more immaculate that having AC/DC cover ZZ-Top songs while Emma Watson showers me with hundreds. But that will just have to stay written on the daily letters I write Hermione.The majority of the movie is reminiscent of Shakespeare-esque scenes where diplomatic leaders are talking about something that might be important, but you have no idea what's going on anymore because you blanked out an hour ago. It's like watching Game of Thrones after they stopped showing nudity, but before the ghost zombies showed up. Lincoln is 65% cabinet meeting discussions, 10% violence, 5% Tommy Lee Jones and the rest I don't know because I passed out about fourteen times and every time the movie was still playing.Perhaps this is what Lincoln's life was mostly like, but please Spielberg, throw in some violence or dinosaurs or have an enormous robot appear for no real reason. It worked for Wild Wild West, which was completely terrible, but now has spawned a cult of weirdness. Or try focusing on a larger part of Lincoln's life, like how he grew into being a powerful patriot wielding an ax to defend freedom and justice and was called Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter.So you argue, ""But it's Steven Spielberg?"" And I answer, ""Duel, 1941 and Always were massive flops"". You retort, ""What do you personally think of those movies?"" I answer, ""I love all three of them"". But I'm in a minority on this one, and thus win this argument, as long we don't bring up the 25 agreed upon classics he directed, or Jaws which is the greatest movie that doesn't involve droids.So you counter with, ""But it starred Daniel Day Lewis."" Yes, Daniel Day Lewis is a master actor. He carried both Gangs of New York and There Will Be Blood, amongst many others. But in Lincoln, Lewis just stumbles unnoticed into committee meetings, and give quips and jokes like he's on massive amounts of opiates. He reminded me of Popeye's dad Pappy, but drunk and giving a three hour lecture in parables that I don't get. Also the great Sally Field has less screen time than it takes to get through the Zaxby's drive through, so there's that.The truth is that I didn't totally dislike Lincoln, as it was a good attempt to capture a man with such an epic life. But it was also very pretentious and boring. You can call me un-patriotic, though I voted like five times in the last election and I hate paying my taxes and have seventeen ketchup packets from McDonalds in a drawer plus enough pepper to start a war. But in the end, Lincoln would've made a great History Channel movie of the week, but to be recognized as a classic is ridiculous. Just skip this one all together and re-watch Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure instead.",4.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Daniel Day Lewis Towering Performance,"Daniel Day Lewis becomes Abraham Lincoln in this splendid film directed by Steven Spielberg. A sure Oscar winner!I liked Tommy Lee Jones in this film but feel Sally Field was too old and perhaps too arch as Mary Todd Lincoln. The role of Mary Todd Lincoln has intrigued actresses over the years and one of the roles that Bette Davis tried to get Jack Warner to film while Bette was the Star of the Warner Bros. Lot. Ms. Field is 66 but looks ages younger but the fact is that Mary Todd Lincoln was 15 years younger than Lincoln himself. I have read that Spielberg and Day-Lewis were concerned over this fact but Field's persistence paid off and was cast. Who else could have done Mary Todd Lincoln?This film has splendid art direction and is a credit to the studios that filmed this epic: 20th Century Fox, Dreamworks and Disney. Years ago one studio would be listed as producer but in today's fragmented Hollywood co productions are the norm.PS One day I would like to see Daniel Day Lewis and Meryl Streep in a movie, what an acting duel that would be",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Unconvinced Brit,"Well, I really don't know. This film really didn't move me. Somehow, the impression I'd got of Lincoln the man was more than what Daniel Day Lewis could muster for him. Nice casting for the film but it still struck a wrong note with me. Lewis too often portrayed him as a diminutive hunched and tired of life man. This is a pity because it may be because he was trying to capture the essence of the 19th century president whilst being surrounded by healthy, equivalently tall peers. The voice too is forced and squeaky. This is not commanding and domineering. Lincoln, a giant, immovably straight thinking juggernaut isn't to be found here. Sad, so you'll just have to keep your eyes closed and listen to the dialogue. This is mostly fair enough with the occasional trip into the preposterous. You know the story and know how this ends so you can leave before the end and not miss anything. Shame really that something better couldn't have been made to celebrate the absolutely extraordinary achievements of this unique man.",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
Daniel Day Lewis and Spielberg bring the icon Lincoln back to life,"¨I could write shorter sermons but when I get started I'm too lazy to stop.¨Lincoln is without a doubt the most iconic figure in America's history and for that fact alone this movie is worth checking out considering it is a well researched biopic directed by one of the best contemporary filmmakers: Steven Spielberg. Lincoln may not be as entertaining as it is informative, but none the less this is a film that will stick with you and help you understand perhaps a bit more why Lincoln remains such a beloved and respectful figure in our society today. This film will win several Academy Awards and perhaps even Best Picture thanks to a wonderful lead performance from Daniel Day Lewis, a great supporting cast, and a brilliant screenplay from Tony Kushner, who had previously worked with Steven in Munich. What stands out about this biopic is the way in which Spielberg presents it by deciding to focus on a specific period during Lincoln's second term as President. The film doesn't have flashbacks or tell us anything about Lincoln's past life, but rather focuses on a specific period in time where the President is trying to abolish slavery by getting the 13th Amendment passed in the Constitution. All this occurring while the Civil War is going on of course, as we see how Lincoln brilliantly manages to maneuver both things at once. By deciding to film the biopic this way we can focus on an important period in Lincoln's life, without having to go through his entire life. I felt that this way we were able to learn much more about the President and his actions than we would have if we were given every specific about his entire life. By focusing on this specific period we really learn and understand the person that Abe is. I thought this was just a brilliant way to approach the film and it worked wonderfully.The film takes place during Abraham Lincoln's (Daniel Day Lewis) second term as president in 1865 while the Civil War is nearing its end. Lincoln knows that if he wants to abolish slavery once and for all in America he will have to do it before the Civil War is over. Concerned about the little effect his emancipation act will have on the slaves after the war he begins to push for the 13th Amendment to be passed before peace is reached. The Senate has already passed the amendment, and now it is up to the House of Representatives to pass it. He knows he has the votes from the Republican Party, but he still will need about 20 Democratic votes in order to get the amendment passed. In this political game that Lincoln begins to play he tries to extend the Civil War as much as possible in order to get the amendment passed, although he knows that the longer he extends the War the more innocent lives will be lost, including that of his son Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) who has decided to join the War. This crisis of conscience that Lincoln faces begins to take a toll on him and his family, although he manages to maintain his serenity through these troubled times. Sally Field plays his wife Mary, while David Strathairn is William Seward the Secretary of State. Tommy Lee Jones is Thaddeus Stevens, one of the Republicans in the House of Representatives who highly favors the amendment.From the moment that the film begins you get a sense that you really are seeing Abraham Lincoln, the icon himself come to life. Daniel Day Lewis immerses himself completely into his role in such a way that you forget that you are seeing a portrayal of Lincoln, and actually begin to see Lincoln himself. Daniel is a tremendous actor, he surprised us all in There Will Be Blood, and once again he outdoes himself. I wouldn't be surprised if he wins his third Oscar for his tremendous performance here. He is the highlight of the film. The rest of the cast is also brilliant: You have Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, John Hawkes, Jackie Earle Hayley, and Jared Harris among many other great actors. The entire cast here is magnificent as they transport us into the past in such a way that you forget you are watching a film. Everything about this film works really well, but I felt it worked more as a history lesson than as a piece of entertainment. This is not an action film, it doesn't focus on the Civil War, but rather it takes a more personal approach as to the persona of Lincoln and the strategic politic mind he had. This is a film that will help you understand more about the man and how he managed to end the Civil War while at the same time abolish slavery. This is perhaps the greatest historical American political film ever made. Unfortunately I'm not a fan of politics and I did find this film a bit heavy handed, but it was a wonderful experience and it helped me understand and learn more about the man Lincoln.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"

Like a great play with phenomenal cast,"Knowing that story quite well, and as a fan of Spielberg, I was expecting a lot from this film, that I saw after all the buzz following Academy Awards nominations. As many critics have reviewed, this is essentially a dialogue movie, people are talking all the time, sometimes in law babble. So the film is more like a theatre play, with very few scenes of real action. But it's a masterpiece in its genre. There are so much great performances in it that's impossible to signal them all. At least, I was moved a lot by many scenes with George Yeaman (Michael Stuhlbarg), Preston Blair (Hal Holbrook), Molly Lincoln (Sally Field), Robert Lincoln (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ulysses S. Grant (Jared Harris), Elizabeth Keckley (Gloria Reuben), W.N. Bilbo (James Spader), and of course, Thaddeus Stevens (Tommy Lee Jones). Not surprisingly: in all the scenes these great actors are sharing the screen with Daniel Day-Lewis. After seeing him in so many films where he was great, it seems almost impossible that this actor may get better. He is and it's a joy to watch. You must see this film, a history lesson.",9.0,Anonymous,"Biography, History"
