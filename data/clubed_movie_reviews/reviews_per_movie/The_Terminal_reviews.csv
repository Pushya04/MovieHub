I can't believe I missed out on the film when it came out,"Yeah, it might be unrealistic and cheesy at times but it's still a great movie and pleasant to watch. It's heartwarming and has humanity to it along with cute comedic moments. Tom Hanks Russian accent seems forced in the beginning but I quickly got use to it and seemed natural afterwards. Tom plays a very naive and yet kind hearted guy name Viktor Navorski who can't leave the airport terminal because of certain circumstances. And Stanli Tucci put on a believable performance and fit the mood of this movie well. He plays a Frank Dixon who is the head of security at the airport this movie takes place. And is the one that gives Navorski the most difficult time but without him there wouldn't be this story. The comedic moments in this movie really works and is a film the whole family can enjoy. The different scenarios come together in a delightful manner and that is what this film is, it's delightful and entertaining. So parts just seem way too far-fetched and underdeveloped. But that is passable because this isn't suppose to be a really realistic film. In fact it sorted reminded me of ""Forrest Gump"" except it takes place in a terminal. Overall this is a movie that adults and kids can enjoy.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Waiting can be exciting It can be also entertaining,"The film begins with a cool look (green and blue), because Spielberg doesn't think of Immigration as a warm place to be for the few minutes it takes to clear a passenger and get him on his way So all the cool tones are evident until Viktor starts to settle into his new home He is going to be stuck in New York's JFK airport for an unspecified amount of time From this moment we see Viktor stuck, trapped, unable to enter United States and that's the fun of this filmTom Hanks is really so calm, so likable, so emotional, so funny and so real in what he does Here, he's a very dignified person who is extremely trusting and always full of positive hope You couldn't insult him if you try It's very hard to hurt his feelings He finds the bright side of every angle problem he faces and finds a way for him to live with the situation He has the virtue of patience, and the testament to hard work, perseverance, and humility He loves people, and he experiences the culture in an odd wayHanks plays a Krakozhian capable gentleman whose name is Viktor Navorski who finds himself without a passport and a visa once both are taken from him by the powers-that-be at the terminal, because his visa no longer counts, since his country is no longer in existence, and his passport is no longer validCatherine Zeta-Jones brings vulnerability and insecurity to her unhappy character She plays the gorgeous flight attendant Amalia Warren, a very sensible woman who's always looking for love, trying to find the person that will be her prince She really wears her emotions on her sleeve and is lonely She wants some strong relationship in her life Viktor and Amelia have oceans of things in common and it ends up playing itself out and that's a nice thing to playThe story leaves a lot for reflection, and in some ways, Viktor's stillness allows him to be a mirror for the people working in the airport to meditate on their own lives""The Terminal"" is a charming film It looks beautifully and elegantly, but realistically",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
fun film,"Although I should not have been surprised, Spielberg and Hanks, had greatness written all over it. But I got suckered into a lot of the bad press around the film and suppose I judged it before I had watched it. Anyway, I have now watched it and I liked it.I thought the first half of the film was absolutely fantastic, the humor, the acting, the character development - they were all good. I thought the second half of the film suffered a little from becoming a bit over emotional, the love story seemed out of sorts and the way the entire airport staff seemed to know every thing about everyone else was a bit far fetched, I worked in an airport for many years and knew virtually no-one from outside the people I worked with on a daily basis, but maybe that's just me! But I forgave the film these slight nuances and allowed myself to enjoy it. I don't think Hanks or Spielberg will win any more Oscars, but it was a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours on a Sunday night!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Feel-Good Dramedy That Explores Humanity,"Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg, two of the biggest names in Hollywood, two people who could literally make any film they wanted to, and instead they settle on a feel-good dramedy... good thinking Steven. 'The Terminal' is a charming adaptation of a true story about a foreign civilian stuck in an American airport terminal lounge after his country faces war. The thing that makes this film worth watching are the excellent performances from the amiable cast and the sympathetic direction from Spielberg. After watching some of the behind the scenes as well, I was amazed at how the crew had built a full-size replica airport in a hangar in LA complete with working escalators, the attention to detail is astounding, and this makes the film that much more worth sitting through. 'The Terminal' is an entertaining comedy-drama that explores humanity and sentimentality, a spectacular flick from Spielberg and Hanks.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wow...A sweet movie...,"Some movies just fascinate us with its cuteness..and here comes ""The Terminal"". It tells the story of a foreigner who gets stuck in an Airport in the United States and the protagonist's efforts to adapt to this horrible situation forms the rest of the story. Tom Hanks at his very best in this comedy feel-good entertainer. The movie shows us love and innocence could still do wonders in this difficult world.
I bet, you will watch this movie again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Feel-good,"It's funny how Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, two of Hollywood's most powerful men, who could literally do any movie they want, end up making something like The Terminal. Instead of reaching for new heights of film-making like including the latest in special effects, or new original ways of storytelling and editing, Spielberg goes back to a simpler form. That in itself is surprisingly refreshing. Filmmakers try so hard to be inventive and change the typical form of the classics, that when someone finally does go back to that Capra or Wilder fashion, it ends up seeming original. That's what The Terminal goes for. A movie about characters, not plot. About emotion, not CGI. It's a true heart-felt piece of work. It's funny, it's cute, and it always keeps you interested.Tom Hanks leads an exceptional cast as Viktor Navorski, a man stranded in JFK airport, not welcome in the U.S. and having no country to come home to. Throughout the experience he makes friends, a love interest, and a rival. He changes all of their lives, of course. That's to be expected from a movie like this. Tom Hanks is totally believable, accent and all. It's a performance well worthy of an Oscar nod.I loved The Terminal for many reasons, but one big reason is it's simplicity. And more importantly, because it is good at being simple. It doesn't contribute anything new to movies, it doesn't try to. It is what it is. A great, feel-good film. Something that is getting rarer and rarer these days. Sometimes you'll want to see a gritty, wrenching melodrama, but other times you'll want to see The Terminal.My rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Tom Hanks loves being stuck,"Tom Hanks seems to be good at the ""stuck"" role. First he was stuck on an island in ""Castaway"", now he is stuck in an airport in ""The Terminal"". He plays Viktor Navorski and he is in America from his Eastern European home, but since there is turmoil in his land, he can't get permission to step foot onto American soil.In a movie such as this one, you are greatly relying on the actor to carry it. This is a movie with no action, no real romance, no special effects, and no scene changes. Tom Hanks does an excellent job as the broken English speaking European. There are a few engaging incidents throughout the movie while the main story prods along: that being Viktor trying to get permission to walk outside the airport. There are a few other interesting characters, and there is even a bit of anticipation as you hold on to find out exactly why Viktor is in America. I liked the movie. I thought Tom was wonderful and I thought the character combination was choice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hanks and Spielberg do it again-another winner!,"I've seen some really good movies in 2004 but so far, this maybe the best. The Terminal is an incredible fairy tale of a movie-it's quietly captivating, rich in interesting colorful characters and superbly acted and directed.Tom Hanks as Victor Navorsky is quite simply entrancing to watch. He is an amazing character actor and in The Terminal he again creates a character who is instantly embraceable. You care about Victor and want things to turn out OK for him as much as his friends in the Terminal do.This is a movie that actually got some bad reviews and I'm baffled by why. Although, I usually can see flaws in even the movies I think are 8's and 9's there isn't much to be critical of here. Some people have said it's to ""feel good"". That it's lacking in reality. I don't necessarily see those as negatives, there are many good movies that are feel good or unrealistic, just as there are some bad ones. The Terminal has a lot that's likable about it.Firstly, there's Hanks himself and I will admit if any other actor had played Victor it might not be the movie it is, Hanks is simply amazing, you forget who he is within the first five minutes. I won't mention everyone by name, but the rich array of supporting actors/actresses were all good as well. It is an unusual movie that really isn't either a straight comedy OR a straight drama-it perhaps falls through the cracks of genres but I'd call this mostly a heartwarming and completely absorbing character study of one man's attempt to make a life for himself in an airport terminal. It's a very different type of movie-for all the strategically placed product adds, there's something quietly uncommercial about Terminal and watching it is an interesting experience.The movie is about 2 hours and you get a lot in those two hours. For me what was striking was how genuinely interesting this movie turned out to be. I'm one who finds airport terminals fascinating anyway-all the hundreds of and thousands of people rushing about to hop on a plane and start some new adventure....but to actually live in a terminal-an interesting (and rather strange) concept-Hanks acting here is quiet and understated and at a level surpassing merely ""talented"". He manages to make nibbling a cracker fascinating. I would give this a 10 of 10 and know there are many who may think it's not for them but I found this movie to be a beautiful fairytale of a picture and hope at least Hanks gets an Oscar nod. I also hope that skeptics give this movie a chance-as good a movie as any Hanks film I've ever seen. 10 of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Agreeable comedy with an awesome Tom Hanks stranded in the airport,"The movie deals about Viktor(Tom Hanks) is an Eastern European traveller converts a resident of N.Y. airport terminal when occurs a coup state in his country.The war breaks out and is denied entrance to the United States .The Security chief(Stanley Tucci) says him that he has to remain the terminal until his situation can be modified.Meanwhile he has many trouble,he doesn't speak the language so nobody can talk to him .But he makes friends and falls in love with an alluring flight attendant(Catherine Zeta Jones).The picture blends comedy,love story ,a little bit of drama with a lots of fun.It's an entertained film with exceptional and sensible interpretation by Tom Hanks.He makes a magnificent acting as the essentially decent foreign who finding isolated early makes friends.They are a quirky and misfits group magnificently played by Chi McBride,Barry Shabaka and Diego Luna who's deeply enamored of Zoe Saldana.In the film appear the ordinaries Spielberg's technicians as the sensational cinematographer Januz Kaminski,film edition by Michael Kahn and of course the prolific John Williams who makes a lively and jolly music and those years made four excellent scores(Memoirs of Geisha,Starwars,War of the worlds and Munich).Besides an elaborately recreated production design by Alex McDowell reflecting an entirely convincing terminal built for the film.Stunningly direction by Steven Spielberg making an extraordinary camera movement filming small details in close-up as general shots when Hanks to be in the limelight until moves to be in the background .

Egoless waiting,"I have to say it is a great one that first shows the meaning and beauty in our life about waiting and promise.

If there is a great example of ""egoless"", he is one. Letting go ego, is the greatness that even Amelia found out when she gives up and scarifies something most important in her life to help Navorski.This simple story conveys some wonderful philosophy for people living in this country busy around everyday for business, families, and so on, to slow down and reflect on something.

"Has Heart and Laughs but I've come to Expect more from Spielberg and Hanks,","The Terminal is a good movie with a well developed storyline and a great cast.I have certainly come to expect better from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks,both easily some of the most talented men in Hollywood,and if their previous work together (Saving Private Ryan and Catch Me If You Can) is any indication,this movie should have been a classic,and I understand that they were taking a risk and were doing a very unique movie,it just didn't turn out as well as it could have.Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones scenes together are certainly the movies highlights,there is great chemistry between them and seeing Tom Hanks deliver one of his most unique performances was fun to watch.I felt the movie could have been better with a funnier script,it had many funny parts,but for a film that is considered a comedy,it is very dramatic.Nothing outstanding but still an enjoyable two hours,I would recommend the Terminal if you ever see it on television and are looking for a decent comedy or drama,but don't go out of your way to see it.Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has to live in an airport terminal after there is a coup in his Eastern European home country while he's visiting New York.Best Performance: Tom Hanks",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

mix of serious and light comedy,Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from Krakozhia arrives in JFK. He speaks limited English and has limited understanding. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) tells him that his country has just had a coup and the US has revoked his visa. Viktor is a stateless man with no status. Dixon can't allow him to enter the country but he can't detain him either. Dixon allows him to move freely in the international transit lounge. However the temporary situation turns into a long running saga. Dixon is getting promoted. He tries to get Viktor to leave on his own. Viktor befriends various people. He meets flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and pretends to be a frequent traveler.This is an uncomfortable mix of serious and light-hearted. The whole thing just strikes me as being fake. It starts with the fake country. Then there is Tom Hanks faking an accent. His English is conveniently bad when the movie needs it to be but good enough whenever the movie wants. Also there is the fake setup. There may be a heart-warming funny indie film here somewhere but it needs an unknown to play this role. The story has some serious stuff but the light comedy really whitewashes it. Director Steven Spielberg is probably not the right guy for this film and Hanks is too recognizable. I don't want to be a Scrooge and hate on this light comedy. Most of it doesn't work for me. Spielberg is such a master filmmaker that he squeezes some heart-wrenching moments as well as some light comedy out of it.,6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Wildly uneven film that starts off well but peters out too early,"Not a terrible film by all means, but one where it is easy to see why it would polarise viewers (as evident in the user reviews here) and why there are those considering it a lesser Steven Spielberg film.'The Terminal' is not Spielberg's worst film, to me 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', '1941' and 'War of the Worlds' (which had a very good first half and completely fell apart halfway through and never recovered) are worse. Ranking it in his filmography, it is nowhere near close to being one of his best and while not rock-bottom to me it is lesser Spielberg.Starting with 'The Terminal's' merits, the production values are top-notch and Spielberg regular Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is once again beautiful and a major plus. While not some of his best work, John Williams' score is pleasantly understated and slick without over-emphasising the mood.Of the performances, which mostly are good, Tom Hanks makes a valiant effort in the title role and does an excellent job on the most part and Stanley Tucci clearly enjoys himself as Dixon. Hanks and Tucci's chemistry is where 'The Terminal' is particularly strong. The supporting cast are good, and Kumar Pallana is quite a scene-stealer (though the wet floor stuff does get over-used and repetitive).'The Terminal' starts off well. The story is intriguing, there is a razor sharp satirical edge to some of the comedy and there is an affecting whimsy.However, 'The Terminal' is hurt by the second half being nowhere near as interesting and Spielberg himself (regardless of his technical mastery) playing it too safe with a subject matter that should have been executed in the film more sharply and harshly. There is too much emphasis on the airport-terminal-as-microcosm-of-society angle and it just doesn't work because of how tentatively and safely the subject is approached.Credibility rapidly decreases and gets increasingly strained and too often replaced by the sentimentality going into saccharine overload. Really could have done without the romantic subplot, that was not necessary, felt like thrown in padding and was completely underdeveloped and featured far too much. The lack of chemistry between Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones doesn't help, nor does despite her beauty Zeta Jones being so bland in a role that gives her practically nothing to do. The characters are also far too neatly black and white with stereotypes that won't bode, and actually hasn't boded, well with some.Overall, wildly uneven that had potential to be good but doesn't ever fully convince. 5/10 Bethany Cox",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Make a trip! You'll never regret!,"'A good movie makes us forget that we are sitting inside a theatre'Sometimes life corners you. You are to face every single move life coins in for you. It mostly presents you failures – but how well do you manage the situations? How well you vindicate the problems away?Movie takes off with the busy scene of immigration officers starting their duties on a workday. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is on the duty – and to his surprise he gets promoted to the Field Officer command. Viktor Novorski (Tom Hanks) arrives at JFK from his country Krakozhia that gets devastated due a country coop. His passport gets cancelled when he arrives at JFK closing all gates to the New York City. Dixon determines him 'Unacceptable' because he is now a citizen of nowhere. With no answers about his clearance to the city, he settles down at the Visitor Transit lounge temporarily. What happens to him? What problems he faces? Why visit NYC? These questions surround our mind as we go much deeper past the first quarter.We come to know about Viktor coming down to NYC just to make his dad's dreams alive. How he wins it – is through his happy-go-lucky friends Joe, Cruz, Thurman and Gupta.Steven Spielberg answers all the questions in your mind. He prefers to show you the answers in the form of Comedy, Humanity, Romance and Authority. The movie makes you sit on the edge of your chairs, and never lets you down – Never even on a single frame. Based on an real life event – the 17 year stay of Mehran Karimi Nasseri in T1 of Charles De Gulle International Airport, France, the story pays a tribute to the troubles he faced.Viktor Novorski speaks with his actions. His comical scenes make you laugh your heart out. He charms creativity and kindness. He weaves magic and sometimes even tears from your eyes. Frank Dixon on the other hand is the commanding boss. He takes on Viktor with his strict rules, bends him and tests his patience. The romantic half of Viktor is by Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta Jones). She although appearing not so much in front of the camera – does justice to her role. Cruz (Diego Luna) helps Viktor by providing him food, while Viktor helps him to unite with an immigration officer Torres (Zoe Saldana). Viktor having no job at T1, having lost his food coupons decides to cut through his problems by not looking at the negative side, but the positive way. He works at the Terminal, eats there and sleeps there. He turns an uninhabited gate to his house. He finds innovative ways to earn – picking up loose trolleys, promoting shopping and carpentry. Finally he wins the hearts of everyone at the terminal and makes his dad's dream come true – stepping into NYC and getting the autograph from Benny Golson.The film teaches us many things. Love, Friendship, Sacrifice, Patience, Problem Solving and Elasticity – are some of them. Released on June 18th 2004, the film runs for 128 minutes. Editing and Cinematography is crisp – and the art director amazes us with rebuilding a real life set of the Terminal.Verdict – Make a trip to this 'Terminal'. You'll never regret!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Great Idea + Great Hanks = Entertaining Film,"Sometimes, a movie only needs a great idea and a great actor to be really, really good. ""The Terminal"" is an example of that kind of film making. There are a number of things that prevent ""The Terminal"" from being an all-time classic, but the performance from Tom Hanks and the ""guy trapped in an airport"" premise is enough to make for a very entertaining movie.For a basic plot summary, this film focuses on Viktor Novorski (Hanks), who is trying to get from his home country of Krakosau into the United States (New York City, to be exact). On the international trip, however, Krakosau is over-run by rebels and no longer recognized by the U.S. government. As a result, Novorski cannot return home, nor can he legally enter America. He is ""trapped"" in the airport terminal, waiting for something to happen. Not helping matters is that airport director Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) has it out for Viktor. While patiently waiting for a resolution to his situation, Viktor meets a number of friends, including a potential romantic interest (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a woman he greets every day trying to get his status validated (Zoe Saldana), and a number of other airport workers who help him be as comfortable as possible in such a strange situation.""The Terminal"" is a charming movie mainly because you'll probably never watch a film quite like it. Under the able direction of Steven Spielberg, the movie succeeds in taking a ludicrous situation and making you care about a majority of the proceedings. Of course, it helps to have Hanks in the drivers seat of the leading role, as he turns in yet another performance that will make you think ""this can can play anything!"". Without his presence, this would be a forgettable experience.Unfortunately, ""The Terminal"" is completely and utterly unable to capture any romantic chemistry between the Hanks & Zeta-Jones characters. For whatever reason (likely because Zeta-Jones just simply isn't around enough), the emotional backbone of the movie fizzles. For me, this was enough to drop the experience an entire star rating. Had the romance angle been done better, it would have easily been five stars. As it was, there were just too many moments towards the end of the film where I was thinking ""I know I SHOULD be wrapped up in these emotions more, but..."" instead of just enjoying the experience.Overall, though, ""The Terminal"" is a quirky, entertaining little flick that really emphasizes the ""less is more"" philosophy of making a solid cinematic experience. In this case, all it took was a great idea and a great actor. With those components given to Mr. Spielberg, he was able to work his magic (sans a believable romance) with the rest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
PLENTY OF FUN WITH HANKS IN THE AIRPORT!,"The Terminal reunites Tom Hanks with Steven Spielberg after their highly successful Catch Me if You Can and delivers a completely different experience, but with similar success. While Catch Me if You Can, had a more serious tone and subject matter, The Terminal offers a much more light-hearted and feel good experience.Tom Hanks does a terrific job as Viktor, a stranded Krakhozian on the JFK airport, who due to his countries civil war is stuck on the airport for 9 months. Tom Hanks has plenty of chemistry with his cast, all the other actors pulling plenty of weight, especially Stanley Tucci, who plays the main antagonist. The rest of the cast shines too, with Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana and Catharina Zita-Jones also doing a terrific job. Though despite having plenty of chemistry with Hanks, their plotlines feel neglected. This is true especially of Luna's and Saldana's romantic sub-plot, which is way too underwritten and gets wrapped up way too easily and conveniently.Another element where the film suffers slightly is the pacing and the over-indulgent running time. Especially the first half of the film can be quite a though journey for some, as a quick montage of Viktor's adventures would've better served the film and maybe would've left some more space for some subplots to develop.Overall, the film was an enjoyable experience plenty of fun offered through the chemistry between the actors, though the film's pacing might be a bit of a turn off for some. Nevertheless, give it a go if you have a chance!Score: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Delightful Fable About a Patient Man Who Is Trapped by the Bureaucracy in the International Lounge of JFK,"Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) has just arrived from Krakozhia in JFK Airport, when there is a coup in his small eastern country, with the revolutionary forces taking the government by force. The USA does not recognize the new government and the validity of his VISA and passport are canceled. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the bureaucratic administrator of the airport, who rules by the book and does not show any compassion for people, leaves Viktor, who does not speak English, in the international lounge of the airport with a problem without solution. While patiently living in Gate 67 for a long period, Viktor survives, learns English by himself, makes new friends among the employees of the airport and falls in love for Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones). ""The Terminal"" is a delightful and uncommon fable about a patient man who is trapped by the bureaucracy in the international lounge of JFK. I heard that an equivalent event would have happened indeed in Paris, but there is no reference on the DVD, and the writer takes the credits for the idea of this theme. Anyway, Steven Spielberg is really magic, and was able to make a delightful movie with such a weird storyline. Tom Hanks is excellent as usual and the beauty of Catherine Zeta-Jones is still very impressive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""O Terminal"" (""The Terminal"")",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Enjoyable and Uplifting Fantasy,"I did not want to watch this movie first - I don't like the claustrophobic movies where the fun has been made of the characters who are awkward foreigners that can not speak English. Spielberg's ""The Terminal"" has got it all but I've came to like it. Technically, it is great - the work of Spielberg's set decorators' and cinematographer's is superb. After a few obligatory jokes based on the main character's total puzzlement and confusion regarding what is happening to him, film starts to look at that man closer and finds a lot in him to admire. The most important for me was the part when we finally find out why Victor Navarsky (Tom Hanks), the citizen of the fictitious Eastern European Country Krakozia came to New York City, NY, USA. The story behind his arrival is simple, sweet, and touching.I did not like Catherine Zeta Jones in the movie - her strength and her weakness are the same - she cannot forget how beautiful and sexy she looks on the screen. Sometimes, it works perfectly (""The Mask of Zorro"", ""Chicago"", and ""Intolerable Cruelty""). Sometimes, like in this movie, it does not work at all. Another detail - I don't think that making the villain of huge proportions of Stanley Tucci's character was such a great idea. It is not exactly clear why he is determined to make Victor's life even more confusing and miserable with the tenacity deserving better purpose. It was not exactly necessary to make a hero and saint of Hanks' character, either.With all the negatives, ""The Terminal"" for me is an enjoyable and uplifting fantasy - sentimental, of course and not perfect but fine and touching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Hanks accent....,"Overall I thought the movie was very enjoyable, but I couldn't quite decide which accent Hanks wanted to use. If you listen closely, you can notice that his accent is different from scene to scene and at times it made it difficult to follow what he was saying. I watched the movie on TV, maybe the sound was better at the theater. Did anyone else notice this who saw the movie or was it just my ears playing tricks on me, well I am getting up there in the ages, perhaps it is time for me to think about a hearing aid. I thought the plot was a little lacking, was it a love story or was it about immigration?

Sometimes You Find Good Things in the Most Unlikely Places.,"An Eastern European (Tom Hanks) from a fictional country literally gets stuck at JFK Airport in New York after his landing coincides with the point at which a war causes his nation to no longer exist. Thus his paperwork and passport are no good. Hanks is in the U.S. for a mysterious reason and that reason becomes the hook in this wonderful picture. While stuck, Hanks sees more of America than he could have ever imagined. However he constantly has trouble with airport supervisor Stanley Tucci (in a perfect role). Runway worker Diego Luna makes a deal with Hanks so he can learn about passport officer Zoe Saldana (a woman who Luna has loved from afar) via Hanks' attempts to have his passport accepted. Also Hanks meets an elderly Indian janitor (Kumar Pallana) who has been in the states for decades, but the reason he is there also becomes a key point. While all this goes on, Hanks falls in love with 30-something flight attendant Catherine Zeta-Jones (perfectly illuminating and beautiful as usual). Zeta-Jones is sad and disillusioned with men (Michael Nouri of ""Flashdance"" in particular) and past relationships that have failed for one reason or another. Director Steven Spielberg has never really been known for romantic pictures (""Always"" in 1989 is an exception), but he proves that he can definitely handle a production like this. The cast is excellent with Hanks making all those around him better. This story was co-written by Andrew Niccol (even though he strangely did not pen the final script), an under-rated screenwriter who struck gold in 1998 with ""The Truman Show"". Many of the good things from that script are also presented here in diverse and creative ways. By the way, the art direction/set decoration is amazing as everything within the titled location was built from scratch in a studio. Spielberg was not allowed to film any airports due to obvious security reasons. From top to bottom, ""The Terminal"" flies high. 4.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"excellent plot, excellent acting","If have to be honest, when I saw the title for the first time, I thought that this would be just another lame comedy, but I was completely wrong. The film was fabulous, very profound and at the same time very entertaining. I think that this is tremendous story equally interesting for the Eastern Europeans and the rest of the world, but I'm sure that both sides look at the movie from different point of view. I'll give you mine. I'm 23 years old Bulgarian and when I was watching the movie with my father, we had completely different reaction. I couldn't stop laughing, while he was almost crying. And then I realized that he saw himself in Tom Hanks character. The fact that Navorski speak in Bulgarian, even enhanced the feeling. Tom Hanks did an excellent job, because he managed to show the world, how all Eastern Europeans over 50's feel when they go in United States. It would be very stressing, confusing and even shocking for a man coming from deep countryside of eastern country, who has never seen such a big airport, TVs everywhere(his first reaction was to try to turn the volume up manually), with very poor English, and on the top of all his country is in war and he is forced to live at the airport, where he must survive without any support, money and a lack of any kind of information(absence of interpreter). The thing I liked the most, is that with Victor Navorski, is shown the typical for Eastern Europe compassion, understanding, inventiveness, integrity, frank communication and simply to be friendly. Although Navorski knew that he will cause himself a lot of troubles by helping the Russian guy that he hadn't known, he lied to save him. Why he did that, this is something that Americans will never understand. In Eastern Europe, the people are not always kind and polite, but most of the time, they are sincere, real friends and help each other without looking for any kind of benefits. They keep their promises and will never betrayed their friends. That's why he decided to leave the USA without getting in New York and carry out his mission, just because he could put his friends in danger. On the other hand, the typical American behavior is also very well present. The security chief was always falsely smiling and polite, but in fact, he was cruel, heartless and the only thing he was caring about is how to get rid of him. When he caught the Russian guy with the pills. He didn't show any compassion, humanity or understanding, but only the stupid regulations were important. He didn't try to make even one step to find a better solution of the problem. I think that the conclusion is that we should make, is to look more like Navorski , to be honest, real, true friends, to help each other and care a bit more about the others people's feelings, to show some more mercy and compassion. The personal prosperity, success and wealth should not make you selfish and blind. Open your eyes, look around you and think what would it be, if all these people were your friends instead of your rivals or foes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Charming Movie,"This is a movie about little people who do their jobs every day. Tom Hanks plays a man who is caught at an airport because his country is experiencing a coup. What that means is that for the moment he has no country. He has no visa to get into the United States but depending on what ultimately happens in his country will determine if he can go back there. He begins to try to survive at the airport by figuring out how to find food and maintaining himself. Of course, there are bad guys who want him to accidentally set foot on American soil so they can arrest him. The airport officials are also harassing him. He meets Catherine Zeta Jones who is having a bad time and the two of them have a sort of relationship. We get to know all the airport employees who befriend the man. This is one of those movies that anyone would enjoy. Hanks is delightful as the main character. There is also a really touching subplot that keeps our interest.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Nice set, shame about the pathos...","Tom Hanks is on his usual affeable form, but Spielberg turns up the schmaltz just a little too much, as is his want.A glut of contrived side stories adds more fat than the lean frame can handle. Some unconvincing romantic asides just distract from the core of Hanks' resourcefulness, in an odd mirror image of Castaway's self sufficiency theme. At over two hours in length, this sweet and charming tale outstays its welcome.However the endeavour is saved by an impeccably mannered performance from Stanley Tucci who adds depth and intrigue by way of his confounded terminal manager.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"May be not the best Spielberg, but indeed a ""must-see"" movie!","As I realized after reading some comments posted at IMDb, some people, and sadly, mostly the Americans, seem not to catch the subliminal message in this movie. Spielberg, as he tried in ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"", focus the plot on the way Americans deal with aliens, be them extra-terrestrial or humans. In Brazil, in a coincidence, ""The Terminal"" opened on the eve of September 11, in which we all remembered the terrible day for humanity in 2001, which triggered the return to the once well known paranoia with aliens that the Americans used to have (since Pearl Harbor?), what the same Spielberg tried to ""exorcize"" in the mentioned ""E.T."". Such paranoia has been insistently and extensively used by the current U.S. President to enhance American patriotism, at the expenses, in most cases, in similar or different circumstances, of people like the ""Krakhozian"" Viktor Navorski, a reference for all aliens that daily have  for ""business"" or ""pleasure""  to cross the gates of Immigration Offices in American airports. I wished the American ""silent majority"" that seems to support the current U.S. President - in his current efforts for a second term - could watch this movie and try to understand the beautiful humane message that Spielberg, with the support of a fantastic cast (Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci are superb!) tried to transmit to all of us. Anyone who ever crossed - as an alien - the gates of Immigration Offices in the U.S. will catch immediately such message and be tremendously sympathetic to the poor Navorski I wouldn't say that this is the best of Spielberg. But  do doubts!  with such most contemporary message, this is a ""must see"" movie!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Hanks makes so-so film worthwhile,"This film has Tom Hanks as an Eastern European visitor to New York who winds up having to live in the Airport Terminal for months due to a revolution in his homeland causing his visa to be cancelled. While the premise is far fetched and Stanley Tucci as his nemesis, head of airport security, is somewhat unbelievable.. Hanks performance is good enough to make most of the film watchable. His interactions with the airport employees and his day to day life becomes quite fascinating. Hanks charisma mostly keeps you envolved, though his flirtation with a stewardess played by Catherine Zeta-Jones doesnt really work very well.. A hit and miss film that is worth checking out cause of Hanks. GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"not what i expected, but then again, what is?","Spielberg has made so many ""oh my god that was so powerful and believable and IMPORTANT"" movies, that now he can't make a whimsical bit of fluff without people saying, ""Oh my god, that was so unpowerful and inconceivable and TRIVIAL."" This movie feels like Catch Me If You Can, and requires a similar amount of suspension of disbelief in order to be enjoyed. Tom Hanks plays a foreign guy who learns to speak English in record time by reading a travel pamphlet. He falls for Catherine Zeta Jones, who is still beautiful as ever, even when playing a stupid, despicable flight attendant.But watch out for the ""evil"" airport director! I say airport director, but he should have been referred to throughout the movie as the ""final boss,"" because he seemed more like King Koopa or Sephiroth than a person existing in real life. How do you seriously explain his petty vengeance against Tom Hanks' character? That was the main issue that stuck with me throughout the film. The Evil Airport Director's role as fascist overlord of JFK Airport just didn't jive.There is also an important plot point near the end that made no sense to me whatsoever. It involves the final trumping of the Evil Overlord via an Indian janitor whose catchphrase, ""DO YOU HAVE AN APPOINTMENT?"" failed to make the Japanese audience at the theater where I watched Terminal laugh even once. I won't give it away, just watch the movie and then send me an email explaining what the hell happened, because I don't get it.This is not an important movie. It has no massive revelations or cathartic outpourings of wisdom (although it comes close, in a scene where Evil Final Boss asks Tom Hanks why he wants to enter the US. I half expected Tom to slap himself on the forehead and say, ""You're right! Why indeed!"" and get on a plane to some country where foreigners DON'T get treated like garbage). But I won't rush to condemn Spielberg for taking a lighthearted prance down Fluffy Fluff Lane for the sake of box office numbers. Spielberg is only human, and he needs his five houses and twelve cars, just like the rest of us.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Terminally over-sugared,"Oh dear. A great premise for a movie, loosely based on the true story of the immigrant who was stranded at Paris airport due to diplomatic bureaucracy, however Spielberg reduces the whole story to implausible sugary mush.No doubt the director, famed for his heavy-handed and childlike emotional manipulation, thought he was improving the drama by adding a love interest in the shape of Catherine Zeta-Jones, but no one in their right mind could believe that such an attractive and well-groomed woman would ever fall for the shabby, caricature Russian immigrant as played by Tom Hanks. Such a waste of talent and money.Spielberg obviously believes that his audience has a mental age of 10, and an exceptionally low IQ, as that is probably the only target group that would enjoy this very silly and soppy romantic drama. Shame on you, Steven Spielberg, for offering adult cinema-goers this sugary pap!Hanks' performance is no worse and no better than his recent stint in The Ladykillers, i.e. mildly amusing in a cartoonish sort of way. If I were Russian I would be seriously insulted by the bordering-on racist portrayal. Miraculously, Hank's character moved from speaking almost no English to being extremely fluent within a very short period, and gaining a posse of bumbling friends within the airport. The genre should have been listed as fantasy rather than romantic drama. And as for the comedy aspect - I seem to have totally missed it, unless it's deemed funny to laugh at foreigners in a difficult predicament.With some character development and a decent script, this could have been an interesting film, however it's two leads were sadly wasted in this saccharine turkey.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A good movie to catch at the terminal.,"This is a good comedy drama starring Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorsk, an Eastern European visitor to the United States who becomes stranded at a New York airport terminal because war broke out in his home country, voiding his passport and putting his immigration status in limbo.The plot of Navorsk getting mixed up in government bureaucracy while the state of his home country remains unknown provides a good source of suspense and intrigue, making the viewers wonder what would become of the man. The developing relationship between Navorsk and U.S. airline flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) provides a good subplot, adding intrigue and drama to the movie.Steven Spielberg provided solid direction to the cast, whose acting I thought was pretty spot-on, including Tom Hanks' European accent. John Williams provided another great music score for the movie.Overall, it's a steady-paced movie, but also a feel-good film that doesn't rely on action and gritty melodrama to make it entertaining.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Barry Henley was dour and sobering as usual, but endearing. Diego Luna was a little hyper, but good. Chi McBride seemed exactly like his role on the John Larroquette Show.

Very good film,"I liked The Terminal. I liked all of the people and all of the situations.Most people who saw this liked the minor characters especially Gupta who took particular delight in watching people slide on his wet floor.That was fine, but not to be difficult I liked the courtship between the very shy but proper food delivery person and the immigration official better. Navorski was kind gentle and wise as acting as their Cyrano. He neither fell in love with nor did he take advantage of her.The Terminal is a romance in the tradition of (say) Picnic. As a teenage, I watched with envy as William Holden easily courted a beautiful, vulnerable younger Kim Novac. What did it matter that he was old enough to be her father? The girls in movie houses still drooled over him and wished they were her.So with this. Most male reviewers take exception to Zeta Jones in The Terminal. Much more sophisticated these days. Pity. She was actually quite good. She was like the little Mermaid: much of what she conveyed could not be done with her voice. The same thing with the Zeta Jones character: everything she said had to be done with her eyes and tears. She knows Navorski's value. She knows his character and how good he is. She wants him and is certain he wants and deserves her, but she knows that sooner or later she will betray him and that would devastate him. She knows herself so well that she feels unworthy of him. She cannot betray such a good and honorable man. What then does that make her? Is she any less honorable and worthy? Should she be any less desirable for the boys than William Holden for the girls?This film is not Schindler's List. But it's not Beach Blanket Bingo either. It is a wonderful character study well worth seeing.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Good performance by Hanks!,"The Terminal is the latest movie from Steven Spielberg and stars Ton Hanks, Catherine Zeta Jones and Stanley Tucci. In this movie, which is based on a true story, a man (Hanks) is forced to live in an airport he has just arrived in when political turmoil engulfs his country and his visa is revoked. What happens next is a funny mix of events as he tries to cope with his new home and the people around it. Along the way he encounters the cruel airport manager (Tucci) and a beautiful stewardess (Jones).Well I think the highlight of the movie is definitely the performance of Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorsky. His great Eastern European accent really made him more believable plus of course his usually solid acting. I believe he really carried the whole movie. Stanley Tucci is felt also had a good performance. There is just something about this actor which makes him fit bad guy roles to a T.What I found not very good about the film was the basic screenplay of the movie. Yes it was funny but not much in terms of substance. I also felt they could have shown more of the interaction between Viktor & Amelia. C'mon 20-25 minutes is definitely not enough. The sub-plots were OK but again perhaps less of that could have been included.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Another Classic Hanks Performance,"Tom Hanks has a knack. Somehow he can take the most inane sounding plots and make them work. In Forest Gump, he made the story of a slow, idiot savante memorable. In Castaway, he spent an hour and a half on a desert island with nothing but a volleyball, and yet we sat through it. Now, he takes a story which takes place entirely within JFK Airport and makes it very enjoyable and entertaining.This movie is not perfect, mind you. As much as I appreciated it, about 3/4 of the way through I definitely noticed that the movie had slowed. Not unpleasantly so, but noticeably.Also, as much as this movie was billed as a Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones movie, it really wasn't. Tom Hanks was amazing, and while he was certainly enamored of her, there wasn't much screen time or much screen chemistry between them. Instead of sitting there wishing they could finally be together, you may find yourself wondering why he's even bothering. Yes, she's certainly beautiful, but what else is there?All in all though, I really enjoyed the movie. All the actors turned in solid performances, and it was well scripted. Stanley Tucci and Hanks worked well off of each other and the supporting characters kept the movie flowing. The movie teaches you to have a little optimism in life, and make the most of a situation. Navorski gets a quarter for every luggage cart he returns and manages to have his own private feast from his rewards.One final <glowing> remark for Hanks. Nobody else could have played that role. Any other actor would have either lost our attention from the beginning, or overacted it like a high school Shakespeare production. Kudos to Tom.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Long live the Republic of Krakozhia!,"The Terminal tells the story of how an Eastern-European man called Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) gets stranded at JFK airport after his home country - the fictional republic of Krakozhia - suffers a coup d'état and the United States suspends all diplomatic relationships while Viktor finds mid-fly to the United States. The beginning of the film is very emotional as we see Viktor react to this unfortunate event, but it quickly devolves into a comedy.The film's main theme is the failure of the American system in yet another aspect: diplomacy and human rights. Viktor Navorski is not seen as a human being but as a nuisance by the airport administration, despite the fact he followed all legal procedures to enter the United States and his irregular immigration status not being his fault.The Terminal finds a good balance between drama and comedy, with incredible performances across the board from its talent-packed cast which includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride, and a young Zoe Saldaña.Despite the outstanding performance of Tom Hanks as Viktor Navorski, I believe the film would have benefited from an Eastern-European actor playing the role, not only for representation purposes but as a way of telling a more compelling and emotional story. Maybe if this was an independent film we could have seen something of that nature, but being Hollywood I understand going for a big-name actor.Directed by Steven Spielberg, The Terminal reminds us that life is about the journey and not the destination. At the end of the day, the reason why Viktor Navorski wanted to enter The United States is not important. It was his time in the terminal that he will remember the most.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Heartwarming Tale,"When renting the Terminal I was expecting a comedy, which it is not. It is a heartwarming comedic drama. First off Hanks has to be one of the most versatile actors in the business right now, he pulled off the role of Viktor perfectly. He brings such warmth to the character, he really makes him seem so real and lovable. The supporting cast deserves credit as well, all of these characters are so real and lovable. The humor is more subtle and will not entertain the younger crowd. But this is a film to watch with your family, its such a moving piece and very enjoyable. But what hurts the movie is that in some parts it slows down and chugs a bit, but you can forget about that. The other thing I loved about this was the writing, one of the better scripts that a movie had this year. The only people I see hating this movie are the cynics, and who really cares about them anyway?For once I have a movie I can recommend to everyone, you will not be disappointed in this.

Good fun,"The Terminal mixes together the winning combo of Hanks and Spielberg, and throws in a pretty fun concept too.It's an entirely ridiculous but surprisingly heartwarming and sweet story with some fairly effective comedy at times too.I do think that Hanks' performance was hamstrung a bit by having to do a 'stereotypical eastern European' accent, but he's always so watchable and his performance was still solid.Can the direction of Spielberg ever really be faulted? You always know you'll get quality from him.A nice film, perhaps a tad too long, but an enjoyable watch nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Superb in every way,"This is a tremendous film. Once you accept the rather implausible basic premise, every subplot, every character, every scene is a delight. It's one of those movies that you know is going to improve every time you see it.I think what makes this work so well is the depth of every character in it. They're all three-dimensional. Even the antagonist, the security manager, comes off as a real person with real and valid motivations.Hanks gives a spectacular performance in what has to be an extraordinarily difficult role. Stanley Tucci as the security manager was also brilliant, worth of Best Supporting Actor.A note on the rating. The MPAA has declared themselves to be totally useless with this rating. PG-13? Are they nuts? I'm a pretty stuffy moralist, and this movie should be rated ""G"", suitable for general audiences. No violence. No profanity. (You think there is, but it's just your dirty mind.) No T or A. (Though does CZ-J really need to take her clothes off?) It's no racier than ""Casablanca"".

Good clean fun but a missed opportunity,The Terminal comes mighty close to being a truly memorable movie but is let down by some unnecessary soppiness and directorial indulgence. Tom Hanks gives Navorski a rather childish persona that is somewhat cloying and arguably a little insulting. Hanks has enough charm to maintain Navorski's likeability but I really feel this was a missed opportunity in character development. The supposed romance between Hanks and Zeta-Jones is pretty farcical and doesn't play out well. The whole charade takes an unnacceptable amount of time and makes the movie laborious towards the end. This is still a very enjoyable wholesome film but it could have been so much more.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Over-rated and awful,"There are so many things wrong with this film I don't know where to begin. I'll start by saying that Spielberg and producers should be ashamed of themselves to make this film of such an awful, impractical, predictable, script that should have been presented as a tongue and cheek spoof rather than an overdone, gingerbread light comedy with sappy dramatic moments. The producers of this hackneyed film surely believed that all moviegoers are stupid enough to ignore plot holes the size of Antarctica, buy into situations that are so unrealistic that they are laughable, and be put under a spell by the script's trite gadget formulas that these screenwriters may have picked up at a seminar in Culver City.The Terminal has a heavy arsenal of anomalies, inconsistencies, and farces, and canards: Chinese tourists waiting a connecting flight to Disneyland in Orlando don't have cameras as they wait to board. So what? They are not in Disneyland yet to take pictures yet.There is no way any airport authorities would detain a ""nationless"" passenger to the confines of enormous an airport shopping mall where he or she would have the benefit to escape from a gaggle of fire exits in the fast food stations. Where was the B.C.I.S (immigration)? If Stanley Tucci's character was so resolute about having someone else deal with this airport refugee why didn't he just call him or her in the first place? By the end of the movie, Hanks seems to have achieved an enormous amount of revere and power in the airport by his recognition of a photocopy of a hand. Why? Because he tells a Russian transit in cryptic Bulgarian to convince airport authorities that the medicine he is carrying without approval will be used to help cure a goat somewhere in Canada. Need I say more.There is so much more: Catherine Zeta Jones' consciously neurotic character, who, for some reason, prattles on and on about Napoleon, which by the way, has no connection whatsoever to the story. She confesses to Tom Hanks about her lonesomeness and need for healthy relationship, which she finds in Hanks, however, for some incomplete reason (perhaps she was forced to do another exciting T Mobile commercial) that the producers may of had to quibble over, disappears like thief in the night and returns only for a glimpse as she gets out of a taxi, with a look of contentment on her face that tells us, ""see, I told you that I'm high maintenance"". And...?In the muddled 3rd Act we finally find out, without any consequential anticipation, what is inside the Planter box? Autographs from Jazz musicians. So what did we learn from this film? Jazz is good, being stuck in an airport is bad, being stuck watching this movie is the worst.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not A Very Happy Ending,"I thought that Catherine Zeta-Jones, should have played a more bigger part in the movie. She was not involved in the storyline much. I agree with you people that her character was irrelevant in the movie.Spielberg should had made the ending more happy. If he did use the cliché, boy gets girl in the end then it would have completed the whole picture. I really wanted to see Viktor win Amelia's heart in the end and he could of. The bit towards the end where Viktor was celebrating the end of the war in country, Amelia came to give him a Visa to go to New York. She said she was going and Viktor did not try to express how he felt about her. Didn't the mural he made from the bathroom toilet mean anything to her? If she knows that he is different from other men, (because he listens) then why doesn't she come back to him, instead she goes back to that guy with the wife. Does she not realise that she is making the stupid mistake that she is trying to avoid the whole movie? If she had no influence on Viktor then why put her in the movie. People even if they know that there is a happy ending will still watch it because its what they want to see.Now every time I watch the movie, I get really sad towards the end because the do not stay with each other in the end because the build up to their romance was so compelling and with twist ending it really stuffed up the movie for me.What do you think?

One of Spielberg's most underrated films is also one of his best.,"The premis of Steven Spielberg's ""The Terminal"" might seem far-fetched, (a non-English speaking Eastern European tourist is stranded in limbo in JFK airport after a military coup in his own country has left him citizenless, unable to enter US soil or return home), and since he's played by the very non-Eastern European Tom Hanks, the whole thing should fall flat on its very Spielbergian face and, of course, it's sentimental in the extreme. However, ""The Terminal"" is based on an actual incident that occured in France, even if the director has taken considerable liberties with it.In the hands of anyone else, it would probably have just been plain silly but Spielberg knows exactly what he's doing and in Hanks he's got a sublime actor who can actually carry this potential nonsense off. The critics mostly hated it and the Academy ignored it but it's actually very funny and superbly acted, especially by Hanks and Stanley Tucci as the less than likeable Head of Security. I've seen it described as Capraesque but fundamentally it's 100% Spielbergian and this gem isn't just one of his most underrated films, it's also one of his best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"A charming, simple movie that I can't say anything bad about","The Terminal is charming, feel-good and sweet, directed by Stephen Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks so really, how can you go wrong?I definitely enjoyed this, it wasn't perfect and won't leave any lasting impressions but its one of those movies that just makes you feel good. The entire story takes place in JFK airport (which I understand is actually a set) surrounding Eastern European traveller Viktor Navorski. Just as Viktor arrives in New York his country enters into a civil war and his visa is cancelled leaving him stranded in the airport. With limited English Victor manages to survive what becomes months in the arrivals lounge. Gaining employment, friends and even entering into a brief romance.Tom Hanks of course does a great job playing Viktor, his accent is addictive and he is a simple, sweet man. Personally I would have liked a bit more background on his life before JFK but for whatever reason his character is left vague and never fully developed. What really makes this movie though is not so much Hanks or Viktor but all the people he meets and becomes involved with while in the airport.The secondary characters here are fantastic; Stanley Tucci as the airport boss and bad guy -love to hate him, the baggage handlers (Chi McBride) & (Diego Luna) and (Zoë Saldana) as an immigration official. And wow did I ever fall in love with grumpy, paranoid, wet floor watching, plate spinning janitor Gupta Raja (Kumar Pallana), he stole every scene he was in.Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the love interest, she's a flight attendant who Narvorski tries to have a thing with but she's all tied up with a married man.

"""Life is like an airport; ya never know where ya gonna be""","THE TERMINAL (2004) ***1/2 Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride, Diego Luna, Zoe Saldana, Kumar Pallana. Hanks delivers another patented wonderful acting turn as Viktor Navorski a foreigner in a unique situation: en route from his (fictitious) homeland Krakozia to New York he is found in a unique situation when his country is suddenly turned upside down in a civil war out break that leaves him stranded at John F. Kennedy International Airport where he cannot go back nor venture further until either the conflict stops or his nation is recognized by the good ol' USA. Stranger in a strange land trappings aside and with a convincing vaguely Slavic cum Greek accent Hanks' affable comic side gets a full work out mixing into social commentary via political underpinnings cum slapstick screwball romantic comedy (Zeta-Jones as a comely stewardess he encounters during his endless stay in limbo) and his arch nemesis in the prickly form of Tucci an airport bureaucrat from hell. Wes Anderson stock character actor Pallana steals the show as a grumpy janitor. The screenplay by Andrew Niccol, Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson has a Sturges like quality with some playful comedy and sentimentality smartly interplayed with the nimble stylings of Hanks as he tries to make do with silent screen homage to the likes of Chaplin and Keaton expertly staged by master filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Kudos to Alex McDowell's production design of building an actual replica of the famous airport as an entity unto itself. In spite of its cloying possibilities the film works in the sense of the universal belief that home is where the heart is.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Endearing.  Spielberg scores again!,"`Welcome to America, almost'That is the line uttered by Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) to the recently arrived Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) in Steve Speilberg's new film The Terminal.The film, set almost entirely in a New York airport, tells the story of Victor's attempts to gain entry to America after his European nation goes to war while in transit leaving him without a recognized country or visa required to enter Stateside.  Standing in his way is the incredibly self-serving Frank Dixon who wants nothing more than for Victor to leave the airport, thus leaving him in the hands of federal officials.  But as days pass without Victor taking various bait as laid by the airport brass, Frank's nemesis becomes his crusade and to the bitter end he is determined not to let Victor get the better of the unfriendly rules and regulations he strictly enforces.As days turn into weeks, Victor befriends various workers within the terminal including an Indian man who enjoys over-waxing floors to watch travelers slip to his amusement and a young airport employee that trades Victor food for information on a young INS agent he has intentions of asking out.  Victor soon uses these friendships to his advantage after meeting a beautiful flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is self-admittedly bad with men and looks to use Victor as a stop over conversation aide to hide her grief in her own decision making abilities.Under the watchful eyes of the airport cameras, Frank watches some of these events unfold including Victor's luck at getting a contract job with an airport renovating crew.  Not knowing how to rid himself of Victor's reluctance to leave, Frank does everything from threaten those that are closest to Victor to overtly lying to Victor giving him a false impression that no persecution will occur if he leaves the airport at a certain time of day.Directed by Steven Spielberg based on a screenplay written by Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson (Catch Me If You Can), The Terminal is one of those wonderful films that requires you to suspend belief in a situation too unbelievable to be true, but too magical to be ignored.  Tom Hanks is particularly believable as he puts on his Meryl Streep hat and nails an accent that if not handled properly could have been if not embarrassing, definitely distracting.  By mixing his new linguistic talent with stereotypical European hand gestures, Hanks is endearing and completely engrossed in the role of a foreigner that goes through an incredible transformation including using his time in the airport to learn how to read, speak and understand the English language.But as a perfect compliment to Hanks tenderness and naivety is the evil Tucci who in terms of Spielberg films, outdoes even Ralph Fiennes in Schindler's List and Danny Glover in The Color Purple as the most cruel and ruthless villain that he has ever tried to put on screen.  Tucci as Frank never waivers from his intentions and his tunnel vision geared towards what he hopes to be an inevitable and well-deserved promotion.  It has been a long time since I have watched a film and actually hated a character for their actions towards an innocent bystander, but Tucci delivers a knockout punch that should be reviewed again when nominations for little gold statues come out later this year.I did make a mistake before seeing The Terminal in that I read other reviews before actually previewing the movie myself.  Although most reviews have been more than favorable, local papers designated the story as unbelievable' and therefore underwritten'.  Huh?  A movie brought to you by the same director who has endeared us with dinosaurs and aliens has made a story that is insupposable?  The notion of a man living inside a terminal for months is possible and then should be based in a more realistic situation?  Pleee-eazze!  What is more believable than a man looks to fulfill a journey as set out by his father (I have to leave this one in an enigma to hide what is really a touching reveal and ending to the film)?The Terminal is another notch for the belt that is Speilberg's legacy. Sure, the brilliant films of Schindler's List, Jaws and Saving Private Ryan are arguably better, but if Stevie decides he wants to spend the rest of his life making 4 to 4 ½ star movies then the movie going public should continue to bow in thanks for all his contributions.A strong recommendation is therefore granted and a longing for Spielberg's next attempt at celluloid.  For any director than can keep us in a movie theatre for two hours making us yearn to stay in an airport terminal longer is a craftsman of remarkable talent.www.gregsrants.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
What a wonderful movie!,"Steven Spielberg's ""The Terminal"" is in my honest opinion, as fine and funny a comedy as any ever made. By adapting a similar approach to a French filmmaker that Spielberg admired and taking a style nostalgic of Frank Capra's best, he created an extraordinary little film that is very humorous and rich with quality and depth. I have continually regarded Steven Spielberg as the finest director working in Hollywood today and one of the all-time masters of his craft. ""The Terminal"" exemplifies his range of talents as he can make harrowing epics like ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" thrillers like ""Jaws,"" exercises of awe (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Jurassic Park"") and he know how to make a comedy that can not only generate a few genuine laughs, but make you grin and warm your heart. And that is what he accomplished with ""The Terminal."" Instead of a slapstick would-be laugher with tiresome clichés and aggravating characters, Spielberg reverts back to that wonderful era of sweet, inoffensive gentleness with charming characters and fascinating scenarios. His star is Tom Hanks, playing a man from a fictional Eastern European nation. Hanks arrives at a New York airport terminal on the same day his country is embroiled in a war and as such, officially ceases to exist. Because of this and a complicated reason explained by the immigrations official marvelously played by Stanley Tucci, he cannot leave the terminal and must live there until further notice. Without a country and with few belongings, Hanks's character of Viktor Navorski begins to adapt to life in the terminal, getting to know the employees, and befriending a beautiful but unhappy flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones).This is a wonderful, original premise inspired by a true story. Mr. Spielberg's production designer Alex McDowell constructed a life-sized set of an airport terminal using jet hangars and the detail is absolutely extraordinary. It is nearly a sin that McDowell's name did not appear on the Oscar nominees list the following year. But the real genius in how this set is used goes to Mr. Spielberg. When he started out as a filmmaker, Spielberg was regarded as the expert on lenses and lights. He can do that and direct drama efficiently at the same time. The way he creatively uses lights and camera movement is absolutely fantastic, creating a sense of joy and humor in the physical elements of the picture as well as the story. The floors and ceilings are so wonderfully lit that it makes an airport terminal, usually thought of as being dull and boring, seem like a beautiful paradise.But Mr. Spielberg's true genius is the way he directs this story and directs his actors. Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Hanks make a more than effective team and wonderfully construct this character, who is not made into an utter bumbler or aggravating, but as a lovable, optimistic man who is making the best out of what he has. His character reminds me of characters played by James Stewart and Joe E. Brown in the good old days. Mr. Hanks does not go around punching people's lights out or running around naked as a lot of comedians these days are reduced into doing. And yet, when using his accent, he never goes over the top. He never strikes a false note. It's one of Hanks's most sweet and pleasant performances since ""Big"" and ""Forrest Gump."" Also enthralling about the story is the way Hanks (and we) delve into life at the terminal. What goes on when one works there. We get to know the people, such as a lovesick employee (Diego Luna), a loyal but unsure security chief (Chi McBride), and a suspicious janitor (Kumar Pallana) with a past.However, the most enchanting and wonderful scenes, the ones that remind me so much of Frank Capra's classics, are the moments between Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is enchantingly great as the flight attendant he befriends. It is truly fascinating to watch the friendship between these two wonderfully constructed and acted characters develop into something very pure. Zeta-Jones is absolutely wonderful in her role and her character is not a cut-out or two-dimensional. She is not slutty or provocative. She is a three-dimensional human being with an involving story. Just the same as the character played by Hanks. Mr. Spielberg is an artist. The great critic Gene Siskel once said that great directors play their audiences like a piano. In these moments, Mr. Spielberg does better. He plays on our hearts like he would a violin. And he's pulling on the strings to produce something beautiful.""The Terminal"" is one of the highlights of my recent movie-going experiences. I loved every single bit of it. When I first saw the picture shortly after its released, it absorbed me and drew me in hook, line, and sinker.

A Sappy Hollywood Tale,"The good: lighting, sets and costumes were absolutely first rate. It's actually quite rare these days for all three to be excellent. Unfortunately Tom Hanks as a Slavic character wasn't very convincing. His accent wasn't bad, but he didn't quite nail the cynical and slightly paranoid Slavic mentality. The pseudo-love story with Catherine Zeta-Jones was contrived and hardly believable.
The airport terminal surroundings looked terrific, but no way would someone in the pre-security lounge be allowed into the secure baggage handling area, even in 2004. Tucci was great as the petty and mean border security official Dixon, but it's a mystery why they assigned an Anglo-Saxon name to an ethnic Italian actor. Overall the movie was ok for killing time, but is unremarkable Hollywood fluff. Not worthy of repeat viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Dreadful Movie,"Painfully bad. A tremendous waste of talent, or perhaps a shocking rebuke of presumed talent. Spielberg should be ashamed. Although based on what could have been a poignant story of a man without a country trapped in an airport by faceless bureaucracy, instead we get a movie with all the character depth of a police academy movie.One or two inane, illogical scenes might be written off to the ""whimsical"" nature of the movie--but this tripe is riddled with scenes that literally made me cringe. My eyes hurt from rolling them at the awful, cloying attempts at romance. My ears hurt from the insipid, unappealing characters spouting dialog that had all the verisimilitude of an infomercial. And then, there were all the ridiculous, contrived situations followed by more ridiculous, contrived situations. I had heard this movie was mediocre, but I was unprepared for the sheer torture of sitting through it.Please, don't bother to respond if you found this movie at all enjoyable. If that is true, if you found a shred of value in this train wreck of a film, there is no level at which I could engage you--we have completely different systems of taste, art, values. You obviously exist in some parallel universe, a bizzaro-world where gravity must repel, fish ride bicycles, and really, really bad movies seem good.For those who live in MY universe, though, I strongly urge you to avoid this movie.

"VN go home (or, welcome back Steven Spielberg)","SpoilersThe Terminal brings back the good old Spielberg from the ET days. We see again his childlike playfulness  I mean who else can get as much fun out of a surveillance camera? We get a generous dose of the simple warmth of the 'little people' ('not pygmies and dwarfs', as Bob Hope said in the 1971 Academy Award show that he hosted) - I mean it reaffirms to those of us who have this experience that our best friends in life are the other three regular 'hands' at the card table.Some critics in town are way overboard in denouncing TT as American propaganda. While there are unquestionably Hollywood movies aplenty waving the big-good-Americans-helping-the-rest-of-the-world flag (e.g. Tears of the Sun), one of them TT certainly is NOT. To be aroused in anti-American sentiments just from hearing 'The United States' or 'New York' is getting a bit close to paranoia. What Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) wants is to go to a certain jazz artist, and the fact that this means going into the U.S. and New York City is purely incidental, in the context of things. Replace that with Paris, France, the script works just as well. As a matter of fact, the true events by which the story is inspired did happen in Paris, France.Rather, TT is about perseverance, survival, friendship and commitment. No preaching by Spielberg, who just let the ideas tickle you gently. The romance is just a little overdone, I agree.This has become almost too predictable but once again, Tom Hanks is a big reason, if not the biggest reason, for watching a movie. Katherine Zeta-Jones playing Amelia Warren has completely recovered her look, shape, and girlish charm in the Zorro/Entrapment days, and that is another reason. Stanley Tucci keeps reminding me that I'm watching Stanley Tucci and that's a good thing, making the villain Frank Dixon at least a little lovable. Even stereotyping in the hands of a good director becomes a plus, as borne out by the cast of minority roles in this picture.There's no point getting too serious about TT. For example, challenging that one just can't learn English by putting two travel guides (one in English and one in mother tongue) side by side is just about as meaningful as challenging that 5 cakes and 2 fishes can't possibly feed 5,000 people. What I like, on the other hand, is little things such as Spielberg's self-referencing when Viktor Navorski intimates that he is afraid of sharks. At the end of the day, all I know is I haven't laughed so much and so heartily in a movie for quite a while.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

All in all the movie is a must watch and you definitely wont regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Nice Spielberg-Hanks collaboration,"Tom Hanks is Viktor Navorski, a man without a country who lives in ""The Terminal,"" a 2004 film directed by Steven Spielberg. While Viktor is en route to the U.S. to fulfill a wish of his late father's, there is a coup in the Eastern European country he calls home. When he lands at JFK airport, he finds he cannot enter the U.S. because his country is no longer recognized by the U.S., and all flights home have been canceled. While waiting in this limbo, Viktor takes up residence in the Terminal, to the chagrin of one of the administrators (Stanley Tucci) for whom Viktor is becoming somewhat of an embarrassment.This is a delightful film, if a bit too long, about the true meaning of home, about resourcefulness, and how a dream can propel a person to keep going no matter the odds. There are some funny scenes such as one of the custodial people, Gupta, watching people slide across his wet floors, Viktor taking apart seats at Gate 67 to make a bed, walking across the terminal in his bathrobe, and gathering luggage wagons so he can turn them in for quarters (he lost the food vouchers he was given). A brilliant contractor in his own country, Viktor even finds work in the terminal when his talent is recognized by the boss of one of the crews doing repairs on the building.Viktor makes many friends at the Terminal and even falls in love with a flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who is attached to a married man and can't seem to break it off. That and the peanut can that Viktor carries around with him make up the poignant parts of the story.The performances are wonderful. Hanks is a true Everyman as Viktor and really gives one the feel for what it's like to be alone in a strange place and not know much of the language. In one sad moment, he watches the TV monitors and cries as he realizes his country is in trouble. Viktor is a smart man as well as being a grounded and basic one. As with all his other roles, Hanks sails through the part, making it look both believable and easy. Zeta-Jones is a stunning and vivacious Amelia who sees Viktor's true worth even as she is pulled in another direction by a dead end relationship. Stanley Tucci, an airport administrator to whom Viktor has become an embarrassment, does an excellent job portraying a rules-only mindset and the disconnect between his job and the people he's supposed to serve. In one of the most powerful scenes, he refuses to let a man into the country with medicine for his dying father because the correct forms weren't filled out in the man's country of origin. All of the supporting characters who learn the meaning of true friendship from Viktor - Cruz, Gupta, et al. are fantastic.""The Terminal"" is a real feel-good movie, beautifully directed and acted, touching and engrossing. Highly recommended for the smile it will leave on your face.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Perfectly pleasing production.,"Expectancy for the new 'Spielberg' movie nowadays is awash with mixed emotions. Gone are the days when a ticket guaranteed a show unmatched in storytelling, style and bravado. After watching 'The Terminal', Spielberg's 3rd collaboration with Tom Hanks, maybe i feel the magic could be coming back.I enjoyed 'Catch Me...' and thought 'Minority...' was a flashy overwritten but ultimately enjoyable yarn, but i long for the days of 'Jaws', 'Raiders...' and, yes, even 'ET'. 'The Terminal' as far as i could see, was perfect. The tone was playful and witty, the script knowing without being smug about it. The Direction was outstanding. The production design astounding, and the acting just terrific. Hanks avoiding the label of 'dodgy accent' by pitching his performance just the right side of understated. Zeta Jones, played her smallish role well, and was a fine distraction. Stanley Tucci was a magnificent Officious Obstacle, and made a character which was almost likable out of one which, by a lesser actor, would have been a boo-hiss villain.The set is amazing, as real as any airport. An amalgamation of every Terminal you've seen in a seamless blend.The terminal itself is occasionally laugh-out-loud funny.It is romantic and feel-good without veering into schmaltz. The music, which i forgot, was low-key and unobtrusive. There is, in short, no reason to not give this movie a shot.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Sweet, tear-jerker that sums up Hanks' performances","Tom Hanks is known as the character-actor that brings out the kid in us through his performances on screen, and this movie is no exception. Hanks plays a foreign visitor from Krakozhia, which happens to not be recognized by the U.S. government at the time due to war in the country. Because the country is not recognized, he cannot get a visa into the U.S., so Hanks is forced to sleep in the terminal of this New York airport until further information is gathered for him. He meets people who work in the airport and tries to get a job when he finds a girl who steals his heart and leads him on a path of discovery in the American culture of work and friendship.This is a sweet movie, like most of Hanks', with a lot of endearing moments for his character when you see his willingness to stay and change with his surroundings. I think some people saw this as a political film, largely because of the specific laws involved with releasing foreign visitors to the U.S. soil, and the timing to put this movie out after all of the talk of war, elections, and trusts being juggled around was a bit controversial. I loved the idea of showing how much trust to give this man and allowing him to stay in a terminal instead of locking him up for actions that he never made against anyone.The movie looses touch with reality (making this a great sob-film by tugging at the IL' heart-strings) when it gets around the end, and all this man wants to do is one simple thing and then wants to leave the city. That didn't really appeal to me. And, as great as Catherine Zeta Jones was in this film, Jones had almost uncanny expressions like those used by Meg Ryan in all of the movies the her and Hanks were known for. That felt a bit eerie, I must say.Overall, I gave the pretty typical vote of 7/10 (like most are giving it at this time of writing this) for the sweetness, timing, acting, and originality. Definitely rent this now that it is on DVD (although don't expect much from the special features right away...the copy I have doesn't have that many.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Excellent, Underrated Film- The ""It's A Wonderful Life"" of the 21st Century","""The Terminal"" is a movie that opened in theaters in the summer of 2004, quickly disappeared, and has sort of gotten a bad rap ever since. I saw it on DVD in November 2004, shortly before Thanksgiving, and absolutely fell in love with the film. I say it's the ""It's A Wonderful Life"" of the 21st Century because the two films have a lot in common. They were both directed by A-List directors, had an A-List actor as the lead, are feel good films, initially didn't do as well at the box office as they should have, and would not seem out of place when played during the holidays. In at least a decade from now, this film will be considered a modern day classic. Mark my words.So why was it so great? First and foremost, Tom Hanks played Viktor Navorski so well, and sold every scene he was in. Hanks never played a foreigner before, or at least not one that didn't speak much English. Here, he pulled off something not many other actors could do. Not only did his character not speak very much English, but you could really see in Hanks' eyes the fear, confusion, and oblivion of being stranded in a foreign country with little means, and through no fault of his own. There aren't many other American actors who could do that good a job at acting the role so convincingly.Stanley Tucci was also relatively flawless in his performance as Frank Dixon, director of the Homeland Security branch of the JFK Airport. Tucci has a difficult role here as the straight man, not to mention the occasional bad guy in some situations. However, Tucci never misses a beat, and this role could be regarded as his best so far. Often times, I found myself wondering why Frank Dixon wanted Navorski out of the terminal, then towards the end didn't want him to go to New York. I'm sure there's an explanation somewhere, but this one plot inconsistency didn't ruin my enjoyment of the film at all.The interactions between Frank Dixon and Viktor Navorski are classic, and often times very funny. Probably the best scene between him and Hanks, besides when they first meet, are when Hanks is brought in to translate for the Russian immigrant with pills for his father. Very few scenes make me laugh and cry at the same time, but that one is one of them. It's just a truly remarkable and poignant scene.Also noteworthy in scenes with both Tucci and Hanks is Barry Shabaka Henley, who played chief officer Thurman. Henley is one of those character actors whose name isn't known, but you immediately see him and say, ""Yeah, I remember him. He was in 'Collateral', and he was also in 'What's Love Got To Do With It'"". He's a good actor, and really shines in this movie.Additionally, Catherine Zeta-Jones was pretty good in her role. Her character kind of came and went, but she played well opposite Hanks and there was an interesting love story there until the end. Chi McBride, Diego Luna, and Kumar Pallana also provided some great comic relief, but also scenes of heartbreaking poignancy.Apart from the acting, the set design was incredible. Research shows that the movie was shot almost entirely on a set, not in the JFK Airport. If I hadn't researched that fact myself, I wouldn't have known. Some may argue that showing the stores such as the Sharper Image, Burger King, and Borders were shameful product placement, but they really added a hugely realistic element to the movie.For a movie with a moderately big budget ($60 million), it's surprising to me that the DVD release of the film (at least initially) has a nice menu, but no special features whatsoever. There's no ""making of"" documentaries (although one did air on HBO prior to the film's release), no director's or actor's commentary, and no deleted scenes. Regardless, it's a DVD that I make it a point to watch at least once a year, if not twice (and I watch a lot of movies, mind you). It's just that good. Besides the acting and the set design, the movie just tells an excellent story. It has not gotten the credit it deserves yet, but it will soon. It's a superb film, and I highly recommend it. Easily one of the best films of this decade (2000-2009) so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Fun, warm and engaging with Spielberg written all over it.","Inspired in part by a true event, The Terminal tells the story of Viktor Navorksi (Tom Hanks), a native of the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia, who flies to New York to keep a promise to his father. While Viktor's plane is in the air, there is a military coup, rendering his native country unrecognised and rendering Viktor with an invalid passport and no where else to go. In short, he is unacceptable. Unable to leave the JFK transit lounge or to fly home, Viktor settles in the airport and begins to find new ways to make money, amuse himself and make friends while learning English. In the process he meets Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a troubled flight attendant whose relationship with a married man is beginning to take it's toll. She finds solace in Viktor's friendship, and Viktor develops that inevitable crush...First of all, the obvious. Spielberg had production designer Alex McDowell build an entire terminal from scratch in an unused airplane hangar. The finished product is extremely impressive, even more so if you know that bit of trivia, so it should stand to reason that the star of the movie would be the set. Not so, as Spielberg proved with Jurassic Park, character and performance can work with technical brilliance rather than be outshone. The evidence of this is in Tom Hanks' mesmerising performance. Hanks infuses Victor with the same childlike wonder as that of his characters in Big and Forrest Gump. He loses himself in the role, from the accent right down to the walk and the blank expression, to the point where you can actually forget you're watching Tom Hanks. Although amusing early scenes have Viktor struggling with the language barrier, it's never at his expense. He's portrayed as a character with obstacles to get over and his resourcefulness in getting over them, never as an object of ridicule. In contrast, Catherine Zeta-Jones' character Amelia is not as likable as one would expect from a love interest, possibly because her character was not originally intended that way and during filming the chemistry between the two made it clear that the connection should be somewhat romantic. She isn't unnecessary, but she does give the impression that she is there solely to develop Viktor himself.However, the other supporting players, Enrique (Diego Luna of Y Tu Mama Tambien), Gupta (Kumar Pallana) and Mulroy (Chi McBride) as airport employees never fall into the trap of 'annoying comedic padding' and are always amiable, funny and touching when they need to be. This motley crew formed a friendship during filming and it radiates off the screen. The role of workaholic immigration officer Frank Dixon is realised wonderfully in the hands of character actor Stanley Tucci. A flawed and complex creation, Dixon serves as the antagonist of the piece, trying desperately to get a promotion while trying to get Viktor out of his terminal so that he can be someone else's problem. Like Hanks' Carl Hanratty of Catch Me If You Can, it's difficult to label Dixon a bad guy. He's just doing his job, heartlessly and efficiently but is visibly conflicted about what he has to do, following the rulebook stubbornly and ruthlessly. The humanity that Tucci brings to the role elevates him beyond the usual moustache twirling villain.On the directing side, Spielberg fills each of his frames with goodies. He has an entire airport set to play with and he uses every inch of it with a boyish delight. Despite the enormity of the set, it would still have been easy for it to become claustrophobic, but there's always something pretty to gawk at, Spielberg achieving the seemingly impossible task of making you want to live in an airport terminal. Spielberg has deliberately shied away from all out comedies since his flop '1941', but this movie's comedic element shows that he's gotten over that, flitting effortlessly between action blockbusters, sci-fi and serious historical movies. The only drawback is the overt sentimentality that dominates the last third of the movie. Some would say that this movie earns it's right to be sentimental, but it becomes a tad uncomfortable. Spielberg has been unfairly labelled as a sentimental director, due no doubt to films such as ET, Always and AI, but these people fail to realise that most of his films, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Jaws, Duel and Minority Report to name a few are at their core dark and disturbing in places, so Spielberg earns his right to lash on the weepies once in a while.Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's lighting and use of colour is always magnificent, but here he fills each shot with wonderfully rich golds and blues and his style, which has always complemented Spielberg's sleight of hand direction, has never been more suited to his director. The main feat achieved here is the use of artificial light doubling as daylight, something which the average film-goer won't notice, but without it, the illusion of the set would have failed.John Williams' music is from the same ilk as his Catch Me score. Viktor's theme is an eastern European influenced riff in the form of a mischievous clarinet at the forefront which is instantly memorable and is the kind of theme that'll play a loop in your head for hours afterwards. It adds a further lightness to the film which in turn adds considerably to the overall feel good factor of a film already warming the cockles.THE BOTTOM LINE: Spielberg has created another 'dessert' of a movie, which occasionally gets a little too sweet and sickly for it's own good, but is engaging enough that it always ensures you'll want to come back for that second helping.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Not great but good,"I did not mind this movie.  It could have been very dry, considering how long one could make a movie about one place an airport.  It had villains namely the immigration officer.  Good guys Tom Hanks.  A love interest the flight attendant.  Even some mystery, the other people who work there.  The movie is sappy, but that is it's intention.  Directed at a quick pace.  The movie has a set goal, Tom Hanks visit to New York.  I believe the real life guy was stranded in the Paris airport, when trying to arrive to Holland.  My guess is that this is what influenced this movie.  I give this movie a 7 out of 10.  I believe people can adapt to many different environments.  Tom Hanks did his usual good acting and made the audience feel for this individual.  I could not even imagine being put in this situation.  I, personally, think that many people would go crazy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Nothing to do with Merhan Karimi Nasseri,"The tragic story of Iranian Merhan Karimi Nasseri is that he has been living in Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris since 1988; due to a complex bureaucratic mess regarding his stolen refugee papers. I was always interested in this story. I knew in advance that this film was loosely based on it, but I also knew that they changed many details to make it more palatable for an American audience (Iranian??? no! France??? no!). Instead, make the main character a simple-minded pseudo-Russian, put it in New York (NEW YORK!! America!!), and instead of a story about a refugee, make it a story about collecting an autograph from a jazz musician.The whole thing is frivolous and clichéd. Tom Hanks' accent is straight out of a bad sitcom from the 80's. So is the ""ooh ahh, I love America, land of freedom, so much better than Russia"" shtick. Old, tired, rubbish... not to mention the 'romance' between the border official and cargo man. It's called stalking! This movie is just a dumb fairy tale. Probably the best audience are people who've never heard of Merhan Karimi Nasseri, and just want some junk food for the mind. This is it.In the DVD extras, I was hoping perhaps to see some reference to Mr. Nasseri.... but there isn't a single one. The authors didn't even acknowledge the inspiration. All they did was narcissistically discuss themselves. Boring boring. They built a whole terminal from scratch for this movie? What a waste.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"One man, two women; crowded.","What was the reason for Spielberg to make this film? Was it to showcase how well he works with Tom Hanks? Or was it because he wanted to force audiences into a theater (or Video Store) to pay to watch him sell out and build a very forced film? I would have to go with a combination of the two.Now, I will say that Spielberg's eye is one of the best in the industry. He continually raises the bar for each film that he makes (see Minority Report and Saving Private Ryan), but for some odd reason with The Terminal it feels like he didn't even have a bar he was trying to reach. The forced feeling of everything that happens around Tom Hanks from the unlit flame of Catherine Zeta-Jones, to a fallible in-flight wedding, to even the corny climax when a character decides to play chicken with the plane, it doesn't seem to work. Even Hanks' accent is poor. It felt as if I was watching Spielberg's table scraps from other films fall down on the floor and get gobbled up by the projector. This film just didn't work. There was not one scene in this film that I can say I enjoyed. Let me explain.Hanks was Hanks. What more can we expect from him. I do not believe he did anything above and beyond his normal call of duty in this film. I never felt like I saw Viktor in Hanks. All I could see was Hanks with a terrible accent. Whether learned or created, the words that came out of Hanks' mouth seemed like rubbish. It felt more like audience-cute instead of a definite control of the words. Perhaps it was just me, but it felt as if Hanks learned English exceptionally fast. Strange, but this was a huge plot-hole that Spielberg left wide open for us to fall into. Outside of Hanks (being Hanks), there was Zeta-Jones who chose to go with the 'bimbo' slant with her character. She seemed ditzy, dull, and completely unfocused in this film. Her chemistry with Tom Hanks seemed completely plastic and created. There was nothing between them that said to me that they were a match made in heaven. While others will argue that Spielberg had them in the film to show two sides of living in an airport (the literal and the figurative), I thought that it was a cheap shot to guide in female viewers. What a better way to do so than with a forced romance. It makes me laugh just typing about it. Second, was Tucci even a villain? Along the same lines as my Zeta-Jones comment, there was not enough character or structure for me to even believe Tucci as a bad airport director. One moment he is asking Viktor for help and another time is yelling at him. These two characters had about as much consistency as oatmeal. Oddly, this was the general feeling of this film.Outside of the characters, the major flaw in this film is the story. By the second hour of the film we have lost all hope in our characters and fearless director that we don't care what happens to anyone. Viktor's dramatic conclusion is overshadowed by the two hours of garbage that had been slowly piling up. I couldn't get excited or care what was going to happen next in this film, and that is a sign that something is doomed. I continued to get a sense of claustrophobia, wondering if Spielberg would finally take Hanks out of the airport and build upon something new and fresh. Alas, that never happened. Instead, we are forced to repeat the same steps over and over again in a way that almost makes you nauseated. Did Spielberg have a goal or vision with this film, or was it just made up along the way? Also, was his editor on vacation? I realize that his epics are normally long, but this one just seemed to drag beyond belief. I needed something, actually anything to keep my attention in this film, and yet nothing arrived. It felt like opening that Christmas present that you think is what you really want, but instead it is just socks. Boy, don't you feel let down?Overall, I was highly disappointed with this film. When I see a Spielberg film I expect to be blown away by sharp images, infallible characters, and a compassionate story. He has built so much notoriety on his name and style of film alone that there is a certain expectation when going to see one of his films. I do not feel it is bad to request these three elements in his pictures. Sadly, in The Terminal I saw nothing of the sort. It was as if Spielberg was attempting to just create a big cliché instead of a film. It was as if he was doing the complete opposite from what he normally does. In this film he had shoddy images, underdeveloped and lost characters, and a repetitive repulsive story. I do not recommend this film for anyone that is a fan of Spielberg's work. It will only bring a tear to your eye.Grade: ** out of *****",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A movie to enjoy!,"Very much like Spielberg's other 'little' movie ""Catch Me If You Can"" this is simply a movie to enjoy. It will not win any big awards and it's not a real must see but it is a very excellent and entertaining movie to watch.I think that it are only two things that make this movie work; Tom Hank's acting and Steven Spielberg's directing. Hanks returns to his roots, that of a comedy actor. He shows that he still is a very talented and great character comedy actor. Spielberg's directing makes this movie a light one to watch. It is filled with some typical and good as ever trademark Spielberg kind of humor and some realistic and yet enjoyable characters. Stanley Tucci really plays excellent in this movie!Main problem with ""The Terminal"" is the story. It is filled with some rather big plot holes and in a way most of it is predictable and cliché. It's like they said; 'Hey we've got Spielberg directing and Hanks starring in the main role, who needs a waterproof story!?'. In a way it doesn't really matter, it doesn't make the movie less enjoyable to watch but it just prevents it from being a perfect and a must see movie.All in all a very enjoyable movie with some good comical moments and characters but not one of the must sees of 2004.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Good Movie, One for the Romantics Among Us","The Greeks believed that, in order to become emotionally involved in a dramatisation that was clearly not reality, you had to 'suspend your disbelief'. Well, don't get me wrong, I enjoyed 'The Terminal', but I'm a romantic. If you're not, you're going to need a pretty thick rope to suspend your disbelief for this one. Eastern European Viktor Lavorski (Hanks) finds himself stateless and without citizenship when a military coup erupts in his country, during his flight to New York. As such, he is not admitted to the US, and must camp out in JFK. For months - during which time he gradually befriends most of the employees, and becomes a familiar figure shuffling around the terminal. At night, he teaches himself English by comparing the Russian and English versions of the same tourism guide, by the light of a miner's helmet which he wears to help him read. Always dapper and impeccably dressed - as we would be, if we were living rough in an airport - he soon catches the eye of air hostess Catherine Zeta-Jones, who asks him out. (I have spent many long hours in airports over the years, and never even SAW Catherine Z-J, never mind get asked out by her. Or, for that matter, by ANY air hostess. Which, incidentally, is their loss.) Anyway, in between his courtship by the alluring Miss Jones, he lays out a well-appointed apartment with bed and stereo in a corner of the building, builds a massive mosaic fountain within the terminal rest room, and wins the affections of practically all the staff in the eateries around the terminal floor. Not bad for an illegal alien with no English. See what I mean about suspending your disbelief? But hey, it's Hollywood. You can hang your disbelief on one of those big white letters up on that hillside. Once you do that - it's a fun movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A touching story in a funny way,"This movie's opening is quite slow, introducing the environment and the general rules within it. It doesn't wait long and the main character and conflict is introduced very nicely with all the technical jargon in the dialog making it heavy and looking serious. But slowly the story builds on itself well, depending on the elements of Viktor's hardworking nature and lucky encounters. The side conflicts really help the movie builds up until it reaches its finale conflict. The funny little things is what I like from this movie. The comedic moments don't come from any jokes or dialog punch lines commonly found on comedy movies. It's rather made up from all those little things depicted being done by someone with a culture gap and thus also has some degree of culture shock. The acting side is really nice. Tom Hanks can really get into character portraying the man stuck in a hard situation but refusing to break from his nature and code. Stanley Tucci gives the antagonist in his not such hostile role a nice touch, keeping his well known knack for the bad guy roles but still maintaining the approachable presentation. Catherine Zeta Jones also give quite a nice performance in doing the romantic sweetener part.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A delight in many ways.,"Steven Spielberg and his star, Tom Hanks,(who made a brilliant performance in this movie) have made a sweet and delicate comedy. It is with a great feeling and passion Spielberg have made this movie. It shows us of who we really are and the differences between people. The Terminal is a place that becomes more of a home and a place to work for Viktor Navorski (Hanks). He gets stuck because of the war and in this terminal he finds love and he discover things among people he did not believe. Coming from an eastern-Europe country to USA he also fulfil his father's last wish. The Terminal is a delight in many ways, a must see, definitely!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"""I've been waiting my whole life""","I know that it's a blatantly-absurd contradiction, but I've always regarded Steven Spielberg, despite his incredible critical and commercial success, as a monumentally underestimated director. Many critics tend to regard him as something of a lesser filmmaker, adequate for immaterial mass entertainment, but relatively useless for anything that comes even close to approaching true art. As you no doubt have guessed, I take the completely opposite viewpoint, regarding him as one of the finest directors that Hollywood has to offer; one who, despite his occasional preference towards sentimentality, knows precisely what he wants in a movie, and constructs it in a way that is both technically admirable and unashamedly entertaining. 'The Terminal (2004),' likewise, is one of the Spielberg's most under-appreciated outings, an intensely-enjoyable, and occasionally whimsical, lighthearted comedy that is nonetheless able to pack an emotional punch when required. Filled with a likable cast of characters, and an atypical romantic hero in Tom Hanks' Krakozhian traveller, this is the sort of film that you can simply sit to watch and allow your daily problems to dissipate into the open air.If you were to choose any A-list Hollywood actor to portray a Russian tourist with little command in English, then I predict that Tom Hanks, despite his talent and multiple Oscars, would appear near the bottom of your list of potential candidates. However, not only does the character of Viktor Navorski work, but his personality is so intensely likable that he's one of Hanks' most entertaining creations. Hopelessly lost in an immense airport lounge, with no idea why he's even being detained there, Viktor wanders aimlessly throughout the hustle-and-bustle of the arriving and departing passengers, necessarily developing a haphazard, ad hoc existence for himself, making both friends and enemies along the way. Though Viktor's poor knowledge of English paints the deceptive impression of a dim mind, as his linguistic skills slowly develop, a vibrant personality begins to shine through his initially comical exterior, and a man of admirable humility and sincerity reveals himself. Catherine Zeta-Jones lights up the screen as Amelia Warren, a beautiful flight attendant who falls for Viktor, despite her obsessive compulsion towards wealthy married men who hold no future for her.The opening act of 'The Terminal' does an impressive job of accentuating the difficulties that arise when a foreign traveller becomes ""lost in translation."" Viktor's initial meeting with airport manager Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is a hopelessly impossible conversation in which no meaningful understanding is reached by either party. When Viktor finally realises that a revolution has unfolded in his home country, his anguish at not being able to understand the full details is tragic and heartbreaking, especially when his cries for assistance fall on deaf ears. An incredible backwards crane shot, zooming out from Viktor's frantic form to reveal the vast expanse of JFK airport, is perhaps a visual reference to a similar shot in Fred Zinneman's 'High Noon (1952).' Whereas the latter demonstrates the haunting solidarity of Gary Cooper's character, Spielberg's shot shows Viktor equally alone and abandoned, surrounded by crowds of self-interested travellers who might as well be non-existent. Though Spielberg occasionally veers towards sentimentality, 'The Terminal' is an entertaining and thoughtful comedy/drama; sometimes the simple stories are the ones we find most refreshing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A very bad movie from a master filmmaker,"The Terminal is by far the worst Spielberg film so far. Not only the story is ridiculous  based on a true story that has a solid political/legal base  but Tom Hanks' portrait of this Western European man is also his worst work so far. Mr. Hanks - a good actor -being helped by the script and the Director portraits this man like a mentally challenge person, making this film extremely condescending towards Easter European people and foreigns in general. This is not a matter of language barrier or being in another country, is a matter of Mr. Hanks character's IQ. He speaks, moves, acts and reacts like a child or a grown man with a serious mental illness or simply like a stupid person, so the whole movie just doesn't work at all. Another problem is the Director wants us to believe that Mr. Hanks is an Easter European citizen only because he speaks with an accent; they should have made this movie with an unknown good foreign actor. On the other hand, the three characters that work at the airport and play poker to win stole objects are an African American, a Latino and an Indian man. If this is not racism, then what is this? Regarding the plot, it so unbelievable ridiculous that this movie can easy be science fiction. The true story on which this film is based on, it's quite different. It's a Hollywood obsession to change interesting stories to make then more ""American,"" making this last word sounds like more ""stupid."" Just to make things even worst, the only female character in the film is a flight attendant portrayed nicely by Catherine Zeta Jones; but in this film the character is having a relationship with a rich married old man another stereotype for the ""whore"" flight attendant it's just too much. This is just a very bad movie that insults the viewers with condescending remarks over non-US characters and stereotypes.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An absolute masterpiece,"This movie really is an absolute masterpiece. With Steven Spielberg directing it and 'big' actors as Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones starring in it, I hadn't expected otherwise, yet I was still very much impressed by the movie. Tom Hanks plays a guy from an East-European, fictional country, who hardly speaks any English. It's unbelievable how convincing and with how much charm he presents the part, which made me instantly love the movie.The story itself is of course brilliant. It follows a guy who hardly knows the difference between yes and no in English, around JFK airport, because he's stuck there since his country has gone to war and technically no longer exists. Victor Navorski's clumsiness, but irresistible charm and inventive nature, combine both humor and drama into this amazing film. Add Catherine Zeta-Jones as a possible love interest for Victor and the film is complete.Without a doubt one of the best films I've seen in quite a while, not in the last place because of Tom Hank's brilliant acting. 9/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Film - worth every mark of the 10 i gave it.,"The most important thing about this movie that everyone must remember is that Victor Navorski lived in an airport for 9 months and had no country to call home. I was so fond of the way that Tom Hanks presented the character of Victor to me, that i had to watch it again with my father. (My father is a major critic of films made in the west and let me just say hated 'Forrest Gump') but even he could not place Hanks in the movie until i told him at the end. 'The Terminal', i find is relaxing and romantically funny for no reason more then Hanks performance (oh, lets not forget the really hot leading Lady of 'Zeta Jones') the move is dark in places but the darkness is entertaining as we discover more about Victors daily habits.

"A few laughs, but not really a feel-good flick","The preview of The Terminal is a pretty good representation of the film, which isn't always the case with modern trailers. Tom Hanks plays a man from Krakozhia, visiting the United States for the first time. He arrives in New York City, but before he gets through immigration he runs into a pretty major problem. Stanley Tucci, the customs director, informs him that his government is going through a crisis and he isn't allowed to enter the United States. He's also not allowed to be shipped home, so he's stuck in ""the terminal"" until his country stabilizes. He meets a host of airport workers who have a host of quirky traits, and he also becomes attracted to stewardess Catherine Zeta-Jones. And, as you can see from the preview, there are a few laughs, some good acting from an accented and utterly foreign Tom Hanks, some cute scenes, but it won't end up being your favorite movie in the world.My biggest problem with the film are the minor characters. Kumar Pallana, a janitor, is extremely irritating. His character is written to have a major attitude problem and to be intentionally mean, for no reason except to exact a frustrated chuckle from the audience. Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana have an awkward romance that isn't the most amusing part of the plot. Catherine Zeta-Jones, while written realistically, isn't a very nice person and reminds audiences of that one person in their circle of friends who makes endless mistakes but is tolerated because of her beauty.Basically, if you're a Tom Hanks fan, or a Steven Spielberg fan, or a John Williams fan, you'll probably want to see it. But it's not exactly the feel-good movie that you think it will be. There's a big mystery in the plot and once it's revealed, you might feel a bit let down. Having said that, I do own a copy, since there are some cute scenes. My favorite is Tom Hanks's preparation of asking Catherine Zeta-Jones out on a date, or as he says it, to ""eat a bite"". He's a cutie!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
best airport movie,"I usually avoid seeing films while traveling, despite flying quite often over the Ocean. Cinema experience does not fit well for me with the poor sound, very small screens, and airplanes food. I could not resist however seeing 'The Terminal' both because the movie was presented by the airline before the DVD is out, and also because this is definitely The Movie to see in-flight. It's about airports after all, and I am spending nowadays part of my life on airports!Well, I am not sorry at all. This is a typical Spielberg film, and with the exception of 'Schindler's List' here we have a film maker who cannot care less about credibility. His film making is about emotions, relationships, fears and monsters, and we have all of these in the film. The story is of an East European tourist, who finds himself stuck in the no land zone of a New York airport after his passport is being made valid by a military coup in his country. He is not allowed to enter the US, he cannot return home, or fly some other place. He became a non person in international law terms.The best part of the film was for me the culture clash between the main character and the bureaucratic machine he needs to face. The message is that there is more humanity in his naive, East-European approach to life then in the government clerks supposed to represent the 'Western civilization'. America is an immigrant society, and this film tries to remind this basic fact. This is not supposed to be realistic life description, but more a symbolic confrontation, somehow similar to a Chaplin character facing the Big Machine.There is no other word to describe Tom Hanks performance but perfect. A good supporting cast provides the comic counterpoint. There is not too much to say about Catherine Zeta-Jones. She is beautiful, and this is all what the role required.This may not be one of Spielberg's best films, but even when he does an average film Spielberg succeeds to make it interesting, and in this case funny. 8 out of 10 on my personal scale.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Dim the lights, cue the music, and feel good about Eastern Europe","The new Tom Hanks-Steven Spielberg collaboration ""The Terminal"" is everything that you'd expect from these two. A straightforward plot, a clear cut hero's, villains, and conflicts, an an ending that doesn't fall into cliché, but isn't enough to run to the cinema for. What saves the film from mediocrity, though, is another virtuoso performance by Hanks and good supporting turns by Zeta-Jones and Tucci.In a nutshell, The Terminal is the story of Viktor Navorski. A man who, after his fictitious country is overthrown in a military coup, is forced to live in an airport terminal by the methodically by-the-book Frank Dixon (Tucci). As Navorski tries to escape from the terminal, he makes friends both of those inside the terminal and of those passing through (Zeta-Jones), all the while proving to everyone around him that compassion is reason enough to travel around the world.Hanks has been a mixed bag with his accents, but his Eastern European as done by Navorski will certainly garner him another Oscar nomination.Spielberg doesn't do anything spectacular here, but he manages to give the terminal a life of itself. From the running shops to the pictures of Viktor's hand prints after a touching scene, Spielberg once again immerses the viewer in a world that makes them wantto pay attention. His standard work, but his standard would be the best of other's careers.All in all, The Terminal is a nice break from summer explos-athons, but it's nothing to write home about- 6/10Line of the Film- ""He really loves that goat.""-NavorskiLook of the Film- Navorski as he closes the Planters can at the end of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I don't know when I'll be back again...,"Steven Spielberg has never made a bad movie (and yes, that does include ""1941""), but he has produced one or two - ""Joe Versus The Volcano,"" which was one of the first times he and Tom Hanks appeared on the same credit roll. ""The Terminal,"" along with being a change of pace from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Band of Brothers,"" proves that they've come a long way from that leaden comedy and ""The Money Pit"" - but it's not a highpoint for either.I'm not saying this is a loser; admittedly this movie does suffer from an inability to decide whether it wants to be a comedy or a drama - the scenes of Tom Hanks' Krakhosian traveler viewing civil unrest in his country on the airport's TV screens sit uneasily with his gathering luggage carts for cashback, for a start. Plus the situation he's in is treated quite seriously, notably with the official who's the closest ""The Terminal"" has to an actual villain - played by Stanley Tucci, in the movie's best performance as an official who's a nice guy one moment and determined to get Hanks out of the airport at whatever cost the next.This inability to find a proper tone is partly Spielberg's fault - he seems afraid of being accused of being too sentimental this time around, although if ever a storyline could have done with more emotional pull (not so much in the relationship between Hanks and flight attendant Catherine Zeta Jones* as with the reason why he's in America in the first place) this is it - but screenwriters Sacha Gervasi and Jeff Nathanson deserve more of the blame, especially the latter (whose questionable storytelling abilities also hobbled ""Speed 2: Cruise Control,"" ""Rush Hour 2"" and to an admittedly lesser extent ""Catch Me If You Can""). A distressing amount of subplots never seem to have a proper buildup or payoff (like the catering guy in love with Zoe Saldana), and a lot of it is too fragmented to have an impact; the climax and finale just don't have the effect they should.The shame of it is that this movie is often perfectly watchable - finely acted, amusing and touching, and well shot and scored by Janusz Kaminski and John Williams respectively (not to give anything away, but music plays a key role in the movie). DreamWorks built an entire airport lounge for the movie (most of which was shot in Montreal rather than New York), but the good news about ""The Terminal"" is that it's not the sort of movie where you leave whistling the scenery. The bad news about it, though, is that you don't leave with much about it on your mind - worth seeing, but nothing about it lingers the way, say, Jennifer Garner playing Go Fish with Leonardo DiCaprio in ""Catch Me If You Can"" does.This would make a great inflight movie.*And the end credits finally prove that there IS no hyphen in her name.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A series of idiotic events,"How can this turkey have an average rating of 7.1? Does nobody else resent being swindled out of 2 hrs of their time + rental costs? Do you rate a film at 7+ just because it's in color and has sound? What are the criteria here?This moronic concoction embodies the worst of big-time Hollywood filmwriting, with lots of cheap ""feel good"" moments pulled out of nowhere by utterly illogical (and often incredible) plot contrivances.

A really charming film with a slight dig at the US's protectionist policy and our assumptions. It survives Spielberg's sentimentality overdose but watching the failed scenes with Jones is almost painful (spo,"I decided to give this film a go even though I knew it had under performed at the box office in America and had been labeled a 'flop' by some critics.I sat to watch it not sure what to expect but I was pretty much totally won over by it which, considering how very anti-mush I am, is actually quite an achievement. The plot is very simple and it relies totally on us feeling a little bit warm and forgiving  a feeling that the film does well to give to us in an opening hour that is relentlessly charming and amusing. Some viewers will be annoyed by a fragmented feel to the story that, at points, seems to lack a drive but it is the sort of thing that just glides forward slickly and, for that reason, Spielberg was probably the best man for the job. His excessive mush comes through in the love at first sight between Torres and Enrique  for most of their thread it is charming and sweet and hopeful. However Spielberg cannot cope with just ending their story with a meeting and hope, no, he has to go from nothing to marriage in the space of a few seconds in an embarrassing 'Star Trek' moment (and guys; women this hot do not spend all their time at Star Trek conventions  sorry).I found it annoying but luckily this was only one scene but Spielberg also misjudges an entire thread that just doesn't work at all  the romance between Amelia and Viktor. I feared that it would be used as a big happy ending and, I suppose, am glad it wasn't  but then why bother with it in the first place? If it worked well then it would be a good thread around the others but for the most part it doesn't. Sadly, the main reason is fails is Jones herself. She is pretty, but she is also awful here. She has almost no chemistry with Hanks and she cannot do anything with her character  the moment where her boyfriend goes to a barbecue instead of seeing her didn't convince me at all and just looked like someone unconvincingly pretending to be upset. Later, a moment of honesty with Viktor on the balcony is delivered with no heart but a lot of blinking and eyelid fluttering. It is a shame because I liked the way the film didn't cash in for the big happy ending, but it just didn't work and since it was only a small part of the film, it should have been cut out completely.Despite this, the rest of the cast are really good. Hanks could have just been absurd with his accent but he pulled it off and convinced me enough to do the job in this type of film. He works well in every scene and it is only the scenes with Jones where I got the impression that he was banging his head against a brick wall. He overdoes the 'big huggable bear' routine a bit too much but it fits with the mood of the film, which itself is a big lovable, huggable thing. Tucci is a nice foil for Hanks and their battle of wills is the thread that holds the whole premise together; he is mean without being beyond redemption or overly cruel, pulling it off that we don't hate him, we understand he is holding to the importance of the rules. Support is generally very good even if their characters are really too 'nice' to convince me that they could exist in real life! Luna overdoes the sweet Hispanic role but is still fitting; Saldana is gorgeous as ever and is really nice in a role that only asks her to slowly melt to be sweetly vulnerability! Pallana is really funny and gets the mindset of labourers pretty well; his reward is a key role in an overblown (but moving) moment that was such a good image I'm sure it will stick in my mind for ages.The film also makes a point in response to security tightening around immigration and airports  it is a gentle point and I would hesitate to even suggest it were strong enough to be called 'criticism'. The message is to try and look at the people coming to America  they are not all terrorists, benefit spongers, criminals and so on; they are people and deserve a compassion that recent events have shown perhaps doesn't exist to the degree that it could. The film doesn't labour this point and I think many people may not even have noticed it. The point is that we can show compassion to people without the world ending, but that we still need controls (note that Viktor does not stay  even if that would have made a 'happier' ending). The character of Viktor also works as a challenge. We start with him as just a foreigner who speaks little English and is a bit clueless but is developed to the point that we accept him as a person and not on our first impressions: a challenge to the unofficial 'profiling' view of current immigration policies, but not so strong as to suggest scrapping what is in place  just humanising it. Finally, the film reminds us that not everybody in the world actually wants to come and live in the US and chase the American Dream; Viktor's final action in the film? To head home.Overall I really enjoyed this film. It is overly sentimental, flawed and relies on you being totally in the mood for it but it easily won me over. Not a film to watch if you are in a very cynical mood about anything but one that is fun, warming and sweet but also has interesting things to say. The US box office may not say it, but this is a great film.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Humanism,"Another masterpiece in Steven Spielberg's filmography and brilliant performance by Tom Hanks and the other members of a wonderful cast, which brings to light what I love about the USA and dislike about America.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Spectacular Performance From Tom Hanks,"Tom Hanks delivers an exceptional performance as a Viktor, capturing his innocence, resourcefulness, and indomitable spirit. Hanks' ability to convey emotion without many words is truly remarkable, definitely something that is eye-taking his role making Viktor a character that audiences can easily root for. His interactions with the airport staff, including the endearing flight attendant Amelia Warren (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones), add layers of charm and humor to the film.One of the film's strengths is its setting. The airport, with its bustling activity and diverse array of characters, becomes a world of itself. The supporting cast, including Stanley Tucci as the strict but ultimately sympathetic airport official invokes into events itself.In conclusion, ""The Terminal"" is a spectacular movie that showcases the best of human nature. Tom Hanks' brilliant performance, combined with Spielberg's brilliant direction, results in a film that is both entertaining and deeply moving. Whether you're in the mood for a good laugh or a touching story, ""The Terminal"" is sure to leave you with a smile on your face.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

I didn't really buy the romance but was truly fascinated by the rest of it,"The Terminal is another co-operation work between director Steven Spielberg and actor Tom Hanks. Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is an Eastern European just arriving in New York. Just as he gets off his plane he learns that his country has broke out into civil war.Viktor attempts to leave JFK Airport but is not permitted to go into the city or to get onto a flight home. Viktor must now wait patiently for the war to end so he may enter the city. Viktor takes up residence in an unfinished terminal while the newly appointed director of the airport Frank Dixon becomes ever frustrated by Viktor.Viktor is able to find ways to get money and uses his skills to earn a job actually building the airport. As Viktor slowly begins to adapt to the store he befriends and interesting group of guys. One he helps to get a date with a security guard, another he plays poker with, and the third believes the man to be a CIA agent. Viktor begins to enjoy life in the airport but never forgets the promise he made to his father.As Viktor lives and works there he becomes attracted to the flight attendant Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The film is truly a tale of how waiting patiently eventually pays off. Even though the film is highly intelligent and flows very well the romance I thought was not needed. I saw no connection between Viktor and Amelia.Tom Hanks however brought the movie out of the dust. His acting job is fantastic and the heavy accent makes him sound completely different. Hanks does give one of his best performances of his career. The film is highly emotional at some scenes including the first day Viktor is stranded in the airport and the scene where he translates for the desperate immigrant with the drugs.I thought the film is a bit updated version on Hanks earlier successful film Cast Away (2000) and is almost as good. I thought it was good. The end scene does get a little corny and the romance scenes aren't to strong but well thought out. The film has a good story, a good cast, and a strong message which made it very good.The Terminal.

The main problem with the movie,"Here is the main problem with ""The Terminal"": It doesn't know what genre to be. ""The Terminal"" could have been a funny human comedy, and at times it works well on that level. However, there are times -- because of the absolute absurdity and unbelievability of much of the plot -- the movie sneaks into allegory and symbolism. And that would be fine. At other times, the movie becomes a harsh, realistic satire on immigration and human nature. And again, it could have been a romantic comedy. Had Spielberg picked a genre and stayed, any of those could have worked, but as a hodgepodge of genres, it is strangely unsatisfying.But the biggest problem is the amazing let down with the jar of peanuts. I was very interested to see what was in it, couldn't wait. ""What does Spielberg have in store for me?"" I kept thinking. Well, if you have seen the movie, you know how little drama or ethos was in the unveiling.Great acting, great set (unbelievable, actually), interesting story, badly put together.A low 7 out of 10, or high 6.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Unbelievable and uninteresting tale of bureacracy gone mad,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsViktor Norvorski (Tom Hanks) is a man who must catch a flight back to his native Krakozhia,a far off country in Eastern Europe.However,the night before he is due to fly back there is a political overhaul there and,without a valid destination on his ticket,he is deemed 'unacceptable' and forced to take up residence within the confines of JFK airport.Unable to leave the perimeters of the airport,Viktor ends up taking up a job there and forms friendships with some of the workers,as well as developing a budding romance with disillusioned air stewardess Amelia (Catherine Zeta Jones).But with the bureaucratic manager Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) breathing down his neck at every turn,getting out is not going to be easy...2004 was not a good year for Tom Hanks,with this and the critically blasted The Ladykillers added to his CV.The Terminal is apparently based on a true story,which is rather perplexing as the story is so implausible and outlandish that it's the hardest to accept so-called true story of all.In fact,there is very little right with The Terminal at all.First of all,the performances are rubbish.The usually reliable Hanks (one of my favourite actors,in fact) stutters uneasily in his role as an initially bumbling foreign visitor who by the end is revealing himself to actually be rather intelligent.Jones has never been the greatest actress and she is terrible here,not to mention not particularly pretty (that nose-job was a real bad idea!)The only one who comes out with any real credibility is Tucci in a supporting role.It's a shame and rather odd as Hanks and Steven Spielberg's previous two collaborations Catch Me If You Can and Saving Private Ryan have been brilliant,so it's a wonder that this one turned out as such a sagging mess...Aside from being totally ridiculous and poorly acted (by a lead star who REALLY should have known better!),The Terminal is simply a boring and overlong experience.Before the first hour had even clocked the meter,I wanted it to be over,so that should really say it all.It had the potential to be as great as any of the director or leading star's previous work,but ultimately just emerges as 'terminal' boredom.**",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Magnificent film,"Wow. It is a fine film. It is more than half we see a fine comedy with magnificent humor that last years a rarity in the American films.

As it is banal. And we see, they have met, have talked, have fallen in love and have run up. In an original way. Hanks is excellent, at what not as usually. It is always excellent, but in this film it was pleasant to me most of all. Even more than in Green Miles and Forest Gampe. Michael Duglasa's wife also played charmingly.

The Terminal Takes Flight Due To A Spot-On Tom Hanks,"Plot: 1.5/2.5: Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is a citizen of Krakozhia, a country near Russia, who is travelling to New York. While he is in the air, his country is thrown into a coup, and is no longer recognized as a nation, for the time being. This creates problems for Navorski. He lands and the airport finds his passport is invalid. Airport bureaucrat Frank Dixon (Tucci) informs him that, because he is no longer a citizen of any nation, he cannot enter the United States of America. Also, he cannot go back to Krakozhia. He has fallen into a crack in the system. The only place he can go is the terminal in the JFK airport. This is the story of how he waited for his country to get out of hard times so he can finally step outside. Of course, it isn't just Navorski hanging around. He meets stewardess Amelia Warren (Zeta-Jones), and they find, despite obvious differences, they are quite alike. He has numerous run-ins with Indian janitor Gupta (Pallana), who thinks Navorski is a spy. He also tries to get information for Enrique Cruz (Luna), who supplies Navorski with food in exchange for information on immigration officer Torres (Saldana), whom he is smitten with. He also has a need for money to pay for food, and needs something to do to pass the time.The premise itself is interesting. Being stranded at an airport terminal uncertain of whether or not you'll ever go home, with Dixon being a great add-in. It could have made for great stuff, but unfortunately, it manages to screw itself over. The sideplots, for the most part, are utterly stupid. While I liked the bit about how he got a job and everything, the side plot about Cruz and Torres ends up exactly as we were hoping it wouldn't. I could hear a little 'LAME' echoing around in my skull. The sideplot involving Warren seems to be just a diversion to make the movie take up a full two hours, and Navorski's reason for going to New York is really half-assed. That being said, this does have a lot of heart to it. Navorski is an incredibly sympathetic character and Dixon is an incredibly unsympathetic character. If this movie had been 1 ½ hours instead, the plot would have been great. As it stands, it tries to do too much and branches way too far off course.Comedy: 2.4/2.5: The Terminal is a very funny movie. It's not like it cracks jokes or anything, so it's not as gut-busting as, say, Meet the Fockers. It does have a sweet, pitiful humour to it, thanks mainly to some great set-ups and an out-of-the-park performance by Hanks. It does slow down at the end, but still holds up enough to make it very enjoyable, whether Navorski is getting hit by quarters or walking around in a bathrobe.Acting: 2.5/2.5: Tom Hanks (Forrest Gump) is absolutely incredible as Navorski. The accent is spot on, the mannerisms are spot on. Even the progression as he learns English is noticeable. This is the second time this year he's done a completely different voice (the first being The Ladykillers), and he once again nails it. Tucci (Big Trouble) is hilarious and great as the airport bureaucrat from hell. Zeta-Jones (Ocean's 12) gets a nothing character, but that's the scripts fault mainly. A special mention is in order for Kumar Pallana, who is hilarious as the obsessive janitor.Entertainment: 2.3/2.5: This is the type of movie just about everyone can enjoy. Teenagers may say they thought it was too 'sweet', but in reality, they loved it. I can see people poking holes like it was Swiss cheese, but I doubt anyone will really see this movie and not leave with a positive feeling toward it.Total: 87%: The Terminal is one of the best movies of it's type ever made. It's the type of sweet and kind movie that everyone pretends to be sick of but really likes a lot. Hanks deserves a lot of credit, as the weight of this movie falls almost entirely on his back, with only Tucci taking any other credit. I really can't see anyone having an overall negative view of this, so I recommend the Terminal to the world far and wide.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Hanks runs the show in an enjoyable film,"The Terminal may possibly be one of Tom Hanks' best performances. True, it doesn't have nearly as much depth as the brilliant Philadelphia or the wonderfully moving The Green Mile. The Terminal is a simple film, based on true events. It doesn't sound like the most interesting film in the world; ""man gets stuck in airport"" doesn't sound very appealing, and basically that is the whole story, with a bit of romance thrown in for fun. But with names like Stephen Spielberg and Tom Hanks attached to it, The Terminal was always going to be a winner. Hanks plays Viktor Navorksi, who arrives in New York but then finds he isn't able to leave the confines of the JFK airport. There is a very moving scene when Navorski watches what is happening in his country on the airport monitors and is clearly very distressed. It's not all doom and gloom though, there are some great comedy moments, with Hanks delivering perfect comic timing, particularly in the scenes where the airport officials are explaining their rules and regulations. These are the best scenes in the film. I was in awe of how impressive Hanks was as Naborksi. Not for one minute do you not believe he is a pure bred Iranian, it is simply fantastic, with the accent spot on. Although the problem with Hanks being so good showed what a mistake it was casting Catheine Zeta-Jones opposite him. It is fair to say that Tom Hanks totally acted Zeta-Jones off the screen-and then some. That's not to say she is a bad actress(her Oscar for Chicago proves this). But when put alongside a pro like Tom Hanks, her inability and inexperience as an actress really shows. The chemistry between them is almost non-existent. There are a few tender moments as you watch an affection develop between them, but this is totally Hanks' movie and he carries it off superbly. It is mostly shot in JFK airport but is a lot more interesting than you might think, showing you just how much work goes into running it. The ending is very touching but you might switch it off having wanted a bit more. It won't go down in history as one of Spielberg's greatest efforts, but all the same it is a very enjoyable couple of hours.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Holds ups mostly thanks to Tom Hanks,"The Terminal is a guilty pleasure of mine. It's not a movie I watch often, but it makes me smile when I see it.The movie is loosely based on a true story about a Iranian guy who lived in a French airport for 3 years. Basically Tom Hanks plays Viktor, a middle age man who came from a small (and fictional) Eastern European country that falls into a state of civil war. Because of a coup by the military the old government has fallen and the United States refuses to recognize the new government. All this happens while Viktor is on a flight to JFK International Airport in New York City. Because of the situation is visa is no longer recognized as valid and the US is not accepting his passport and because of the war he has no way of going home. Viktor is effectively trapped in the international passenger terminal at JFK.And this is really the best parts of the movie. Viktor doesn't speak English and doesn't understand what he's being told and there is this great scene while he watches in horror news coverage of the war and not understand a word of it; just that war broke out in his country. Viktor literally makes gate 26 (which is out of service because of construction) his home. I enjoyed the movie the most watching him figuring things out like how to get money to eat, how he makes friends with the airport employees, or how he learns English. He's such an earnest and clever man that you can't help like him and that's what makes this movie work.The cons of this movie is the romantic subplot that is deeply unsatisfying and while does at least have some impact on the plot, leaves me thinking this didn't need to be here. The other thing is the movie is a shameless whore. It's almost funny how much product placement there is. Boss, Discovery Store, Starbucks, Borders, Burger King, etc. are visible at nearly every shot.Also the antagonist of this movie doesn't make sense. Basically it's this Homeland Security guy who just doesn't like Viktor. I think this might be some commentary on our system, but his superiors tell him he could learn a thing or two from Viktor and it just seems that problem is just with this one guy. He seems to make it personal. They don't take it to over-the-top levels.Still, Tom Hanks is really good and it holds up for me. If it comes up for rental or on TV it's not a bad sit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Well done; but a bit of fantasy,"I have to admit this story drew me in.  There is a lot about the movie that made me go, ""Wait a minute..."" but all in all, it was a good story and I was able to overlook many of the sillier events.  Tom Hanks is so good that I kept forgetting that he's not really an Eastern European.  I had read that his accent left something to be desired...I don't agree.  I do that that Catherine Zeta-Jones had a distracting accent, however. Sometimes she sounded like she had a slight southern twang and other times that was absent. This was a largely character driven story, and I thought that all of the actors did a great job.  I cared about the airport employees--and Stanley Tucci had us laughing so hard at what a jerk he had to be.  I didn't find it slow at all...maybe just a bit more quiet.  It's not slapstick, although there's quite a bit of slipping and falling on a wet floor, if that's what makes you laugh (I have to admit I did laugh at the people falling down...).  Not the best movie I've ever seen, but not horrible as many reviews have complained.  I recommend this one to those who enjoy a good story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A good film overall but still rather weak in a few places.,"The Terminal is a good film that is funny, entertaining and deals with some good ol' fashioned drama situations. It felt very much like a documentary at times, maybe due to the fact it's based on a true story from the 1980's, but that didn't retract from the enjoyment factor. To say it's a story all about the trials and tribulations of just one man is perhaps a little too shallower way to sum it up but at certain times, you do wonder if the film's going anywhere. Such it is that the film DOES contain a few laughable moments adding to its comedy tag.These come at certain intervals and everything in-between is just 'filla'. So there are some good, comic moments but in my opinion, there aren't as many 'funny' parts to make you laugh all the way through. The film deals with 'slapstick' humour in parts such as slipping over a wet floor or walking into a window. It's those sort of moments that do sort of distract from the film slightly.Some of the stories within the film also feel generally annoying in the sense of the point of them being there. The film was supposed to be about one man (Hanks) I thought, NOT solely about anyone else and so I was rather surprised to see the little story about the food/cafeteria delivery worker attempting to get one of the other airport workers to fall in love with him. Things like that were flawed and distracted from the actual film. As I said before, that particular story line acted as a 'filla'; a way of upping the film length and it was disappointing.Hanks' acting is good and although his accent was terribly annoying early on, I managed to adjust accordingly and with stand it all the way through. The character 'Gupta' is also rather amusing; using the simple concept of forcing people to slip up on his own polished floor merely for his amusement was rather odd- odd but funny none-the-less. Zeta-Jones' character and performance was also 'tolerable'. She wasn't in the film much I didn't notice but it's a good feeling when you realize Hanks has someone to really relate to as you stat to feel as if your feeling sorry for Hanks if you get into it too much and the acting from Zeta- Jones is some relief at least.All in all I think you'll enjoy 'The Terminal' if you're the patient type. It's got a bit of humour, a bit of tragedy, a hint of romance and some moments where you'll really feel good for the characters as they finally get what they want after the last half an hour or so was probably built up to 'will it/they or won't it/they' not to mention the film itself on Hanks' struggle with staying in the airport.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Excellent heart warming film,"I thought that The Terminal was a great film. I wasn't expecting it to be comical too. It was genuinely funny in some parts; the audience (myself included) erupted into laughter countless times.I also loved the relationships between the characters. Hanks should definitely be nominated for an Oscar. His accent in the movie and portrayal of the character was amazing. He was like a completely different person. Stanley Tucci was also great. His character wasn't exactly my favorite, but he played the part well. You might expect the movie to be boring because it takes place in one setting, but it is the exact opposite. We gain insight into this completely different world. Stephen Spielberg did a great job once again. Hanks and Spielberg make quite a team. If you want to see a genuinely good film that will make you laugh and entertain you, I highly suggest seeing this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Entertaining throughout, but doesn't add up to much","Having been around a few airport terminals in my time, I can safely say that it's a place that I only visit out of necessity, and sure is hell would never think of living in one.  I've been lucky enough not to have been stuck interminably in between flights or delayed more than a few hours, and will be eternally grateful to the powers that be for that.  I can't imagine having to spend a whole day in an airport, and the thought of having to take up residence in one for several days is almost as abhorrent to me as the thought of having to clean out a construction site porta-pot.In The Terminal, our mythical hero Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) from the mythical land of Krakozia lands in the not so mythical J.F.K. airport. While Viktor was in the air, getting from there to here, Krakozia undergoes a coup.  Because of this, Viktor technically has no country to return to, and since the U.S. doesn't recognize the new mythical regime, his passport and visa are no longer valid and are confiscated by mythical security chief Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) who then tells Viktor he can't leave the airport and enter New York City and must not leave the International Arrivals Lounge.  Of course Frank expects Viktor to do what just about anyone else would and leave anyway, but Viktor does as he is told and stays at the airport, and stays and stays and stays and stays and stays etc.  It doesn't help matters that Viktor doesn't understand but a few words of English, that his money is no longer any good, and that it takes him about five minutes to lose all of his food vouchers.  I think it's called having your back up against the wall.Viktor finally makes a few friends at the airport including a janitor, a food service worker, an INS agent who stamps his permission to leave with a big red declined every day, and develops a crush on the beautiful Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an airline hostess having an affair with a married guy (Michael Nouri).  How Viktor copes and learns to live is kind of sweet, often funny, and sometimes sad.  The fact that we buy any of this at all can be laid squarely on the shoulders of Tom Hanks who gives a remarkable performance as Viktor.  Not only does his accent stay consisted, his broken English never falters one bit as he learns phrases by comparing his Krakozia tour book to the exact same one written in English.  He keeps Viktor consistent throughout, a simple man whose one desire is to be able to enter New York to fulfill a promise kept in a peanut can he carries from place to place.  Viktor is the kind of person Frank Dixon doesn't understand, can't understand, and yet in some small way perhaps envies him because he is able to relate to people in ways that Frank will never be able to.Of course much of what happens in The Terminal is far-fetched (although supposedly loosely based on a true story) but since this is fairy-tale land I guess it's supposed to be.  Viktor acts as a go between in helping develop a relationship between the INS agent Officer Torres (Zoe Saldana) and the food service worker Enrique (Diego Luna), both of whom end up being devout trekkies.  Relationships have been built on less though as witnessed by Amelia who has been hanging out with the married guy for several years waiting for him to leave his wife.  As Viktor develops his own relationship with her, it is both touching and sweet, and we root for them.  Viktor eventually does find a job at the airport in a sequence that seems written more out of convenience for the plot than any other reason.Credit also has to be given to the writers and Spielberg for being able to pace a two hour film that takes place in an airport terminal in just the right way so that it is interesting and seldom bogs down.  I never felt like it was two hours which is saying quite a bit when you think of what two hours at the airport really feels like.There are some truly warm and fuzzy moments in The Terminal, some pretty good laughs, a few good enough if not spectacular performances by the cast (other than Hanks who is excellent), and several entertaining characters. Yet when it is over, you'll still leave the theater asking, `So what?'  A lot of the reason for this is that we get an ending you'll find only partially satisfying.  Some may quibble that if Spielberg had given us everything we wanted, than it wouldn't have been true to the story or the characters.  In answer to that I can only say hey, if you're going to give us two hours of what is basically a modern day fairy tale, you can at least give your audience what you know they want to see.  If a totally satisfying ending is good enough for Mother Goose, it should be fine for Spielberg's fairy tale as well.  I still may have left saying, `So what?' but I would have felt better about asking the question.  All in all, it's an entertaining enough way to spend two hours, but it's just one of those films that in the end isn't memorable enough to make it worth a trip to a theater, yet is good enough that you would probably want to watch it on DVD in the comfort of your living room at some point in time.   And if the only thing I can recommend is that people see your film on DVD, I have no choice but to give you my grade and for The Terminal that's a B-.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the most genuinely annoying films I've seen all year,"I guess it's not fair for me to judge the film. I was a bit biased. I had read about the true story of Merhan Nasseri, an Iranian refugee who landed at Charles de Gaulle Airport near Paris in 1988 after being denied entry into England because his passport and United Nations refugee certificate had been stolen. Due to the technicalities he stayed in Terminal 1 and finally, years later, was granted permission to either enter France or return to his own country. The irony is that he has chosen to remain living in the airport.So, the potential for the film was quite interesting. It's an amazing story and given the right cast I was sure it could be told well. When I heard Spielberg was on board, I was excited, because it implied (to me, anyway) that an experienced director was at the helm who would respect the original story without turning it into some MTV-generation romantic comedy.Little did I know Spielberg was yet again adding his ""magic touch"" to a true story, and thereby destroying it. This is worse than any MTV movie - it's Spielberg Shlock.Don't get me wrong, Spielberg's a great director... when someone's got a leash on him. But sometimes he's given too much freedom. His ego tends to get the best of him; he needs to get rid of the yes-men. Something tells me there were a lot of yes-men on the set this time around.And having Tom Hanks play Viktor was about the worst choice. Hanks' performance is simply awful. Something tells me he had too many yes-men handing him praise, as well.The plot is very, very, VERY loosely based on the true story of Nasseri, and I'm sure whenever he gets to see the film as it plays on the free TV in Terminal 1, he'll be quite disappointed.His story was already made into a French film in 1993 named ""Tombés du ciel."" I haven't seen the original but from the plot description on IMDb it sounds far more factually accurate.Okay, so, you want to know my real problems with the Spielberg remake? Okay, first things first. If you're making a movie about an eastern immigrant, DO NOT name his native country ""Krakhozia."" That's about the WORST fake country name I've ever heard in any movie, and that's including Narnia and Toyland.Secondly, the movie's smug, self-conscious, ""happy"" attitude is awful. It's like a continuation of ""Forrest Gump"" only Hanks is even more annoying.Thirdly, all the stuff Viktor does in this movie is totally fake and I never for a second bought that he was any eastern immigrant. His accent was terrible and he's stupider than Tara Reid, yet a week after being in the airport he's learned English (with the help of a terminal worker, who, as we all know, have jobs transporting baggage because they're so smart and well-educated). Suddenly Viktor is a well-knowledged, experienced American immigrant who ""knows the ropes"" - he even gets a job as a painter in the terminal.And then there's the Mandatory Romantic Interest Subplot. It's totally unnecessary and gives the movie a fake, bogged-down feel. Catherine Zeta-Jones is completely annoying (almost as much as Hanks) and her character is a shallow, trite, convenient addition to the plot. Neither character is given much depth and their ""romance"" comes across as being entirely heavy-handed and unbelievable.On top of the schmaltz and plot contrivances, the continual marketing tie-ins are sickening - I can't say how many times I had Burger King crammed down my throat while watching this movie. After I left, I felt like going to the nearest Burger King and throwing stones at everyone inside. That's how mad it made me. When I pay $16 to see a movie (yes, I paid in pounds, which in dollars is doubled to around $15 or $16) I don't want to have Burger King, Nokia, Gatorade, Coke, Pepsi, etc., thrown into my face. I get enough of that on TV. It was truly embarrassing (and I felt ashamed for Spielberg) when he spends ten minutes following Viktor's adventure to buy a hamburger from Burger King.The message is nice - if you're an illegal immigrant and can't afford anything, just get jobs no one else wants like cleaning toilets or collecting luggage carts and earn minimum wage so you can buy a greasy hamburger from some pock-marked self-absorbed teenager who probably spat in your food.I hate to sound really bitter and all (I'm truly not this bitter in real life - usually) but there's something about this movie that just struck me as too nice. It's like Martin Short in the movie ""Clifford"" -- it's so sweet you know there's got to be a hidden agenda somewhere.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Do you have an appointment?,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Not sure if this is a comedy, drama or offbeat romance.  It is some parts all of the above and other parts of not much.  $pielberg takes a great story and provides us his usual glimpses of film brilliance surrounded in his always present feel-good fluff.  Hanks' character is fascinating - funny, brilliant, observant and caring.  The subject terminal could have provided so much more insight into human interaction, but instead relies on too common stereotypes.  I loved the story line of Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana, but it gets ruined by a ridiculous plot twist from an episode of ""Fantasy Island"".  Zeta-Jones' story is so pathetic, I was cringing with the dialogue almost from the first moment. How many times can she say ""stay away from me""?  It seemed limitless.  OK, enough with the wet floor jokes.  How about some more of the scenes with Hanks and Tucci - that was the meat of the story if one were to ignore the terminal possibilities.  As usual an OK film by Spielberg leaves us feeling a little empty and cheated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Funny and punny,"Spielberg and Hanks.  Toss in Tucci and the lovely Welsh lass, Zita Jones and you're on your way.  There's lots of little bits of funny business and lots of puns, both oral and visual.  The story is amusing as Tucci plays the compleat bureaucrat whose stick-to-the-book attitude holds Hanks prisoner for month after month.  The entire movie takes place in a terminal and goes from there. This movie touches on a favorite Spielberg theme, i.e., lack of communication.

it'a all about waiting,"Politics first: Viktor Navorski is man who gets stuck on JFK Airport because his homeland Krakochia is on the verge of revolution that has been spreading during his flight to US. Krakochia cannot be identified as a country and therefore Navorski does not have a permission to walk on US soil or fly back home. Hours of waiting turn to days,days turn to months and before he even notices Viktor has a life in the Airport.Steven Spielberg continues his collaboration with Tom Hanks (previous was Catch me if you can) in a film that is not Spielberg on his finest and even not Spielberg-Hanks team on its finest but still manages to proof that Hanks was originally a comedian. Spielberg's old school humour relies on the odd circumstances of life in a busy international terminal and very much on physical comedy in which both it rather well succeeds.The weakest link propably is the ""romantic"" storyline that keeps going in circles and does feel a bit glued on although being quite realistic thinking of two strangers meeting in such circumstances. Catherine Zeta-Jones feels quite out of the place here and the chemistry between Hanks and her does not utterly convince. Stanley Tucci's terminal manager is overworked and kept me thinking how this kind of movie does not need such ""baddie"" at all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A different Spielberg Masterpiece,"From the moment you see the first couple of shots of the terminal that was built for this film, the way the lighting is so natural for an everyday place some of us would visit (if we are lucky enough) once a year, from the costumes on the actors and the hundreds of extras to the performance of the talented Tom Hanks.... you are drawn into a new Steven Spielberg. Not a futuristic haven for Action and Sci-fi junkies or a prehistoric nightmare of animatronics but something new that this viewer was not expecting. Spielberg's talent has taken a new path in creating a mock real world that at no point did i think was unreal. The pin point perfect Cinematography as well as the always superb editing by Michael Kahn (Must be attached to Spielberg's hip at this stage with the amount of films they have worked on) topped off this movie for me and gave me an evenings entertainment as well as a fresh respect for the 'berg'ster. If you haven't seen this movie I recommend a night in either with your significant other or even on your own and watch Tom Hanks introduce you to a waiting Victor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not bad, but not Spielberg at his best either","There's no doubting that Spielberg knows the workings of cinema well enough to ensure that his movies are always entertaining, but sometimes he doesn't choose his projects all that wisely. The man is at his best when he's got a huge budget and a long list of stunts to play with; and he showed this with his Indiana Jones trilogy and Jurassic Park films. When Spielberg attempts drama, the results are often mixed. Schindler's List stunk of a blockbuster director trying to win an Oscar, and while it doesn't look like Spielberg was going for gold with this picture; the movie doesn't quite bode right, and much of the drama seems forced or overly sentimental. This makes the film hard to take seriously at times, especially since many of the events in the film are completely detached from reality. The extremely swift wedding ceremony sticks out the most. The plot, based on a true story, follows Viktor Navorski; an Eastern European man who finds himself stranded in a New York airport when his country goes to war and isn't letting anyone in or out. He then, through lack of other options, decides to take up residency in the airport itself.In 2004, Tom Hanks delivered an outstandingly over the top performance in the Coen's remake of the Ealing classic, The Ladykillers. The Terminal sees Hanks delivering another over the top performance, but it's not half as good this time. Hanks' put on European accent isn't bad, but it quickly becomes annoying. His dumb antics are another thing that becomes annoying all too quickly, and after about an hour; the premise begins to show signs of becoming tired. Catherine Zeta-Jones is Hanks' massively underdeveloped love interest. It is this aspect that is the film's main downfall. The romance between these two is hardly explored and it happens all too quickly. It therefore feels like an afterthought in an underdeveloped movie. It isn't all woe for this film, however, as the movie does have it's good points. Spielberg does a surprisingly good job of setting up his protagonist's plight and the way that we are constantly reminded of the predicament that the immigrant is in, is good. On the whole, this is worth watching; but Spielberg has been better, and far more entertaining, than this on many occasions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"A trifle over sweet it may be, but the showing of the spirit is very pleasing.","During a stop over at JFK Airport, Viktor Navorski finds that his homeland of Krakozhia has erupted into chaos and a military coup has taken place. This puts him bureaucratic purgatory because his passport is no longer valid, meaning he can't get home until Krakozhia's new government is officially ratified. Forced to spend his immediate future solely in the confines of the airport, Viktor shows tremendous spirit to survive in his totally alien surroundings.The Terminal is loosely based on the case of an Iranian gentleman who was trapped in a French airport for almost ten years. Given the complete Hollywood treatment, The Terminal just manages to keep on the good side of good by fusing its fabled heart with a triumph of the will story line. Viktor {Tom Hanks perfectly cast} must use all his wits just to survive in this unique situation, be it a resourceful way of getting cash, a stoic drive to learn the English language from a simple travel guide, or making friends with an oddball assortment of airport personal, Viktor engages us as he goes about his merry way. The scenarios that are thrown up of course make for many a laugh, more so given that the said airport personal, played by Barry Shabaka Henley, Kumar Pallana and Diego Luna, are proper residents of America, but are actually equally as alien to the folk on the street as Viktor is!In amongst the frivolity {which is great and very rewarding}, there's a question of how people treat people who are not English speaking? Perhaps director Stephen Spielberg wanted to make a point here about folk presuming that those alien to the language one speaks are cretins? Annoyances getting in the way of normality? Maybe, perhaps. It's certainly the impression I got from watching it on my latest revisit. Sadly the fun and serious angle is let down by the good old romantic strand that is wedged into a film that didn't need it. For sure Catherine Zeta Jones is beautiful, but her character is weak and adds nothing to the film's basic structure. In fact it feels out of place, in the wrong airport perhaps? On the major plus side we have a wonderful performance from Stanley Tucci as airport commandant Frank Dixon, Dixon is a complete jobs worth, a stickler for the rules and views Navorski as a threat to the smooth running of his airport. If we discount the pitch perfect show from Hanks? Then Tucci most definitely takes the acting honours on show.It's a very enjoyable film that has a couple of underlying veins of seriousness, it's just a shame about the tagged on romance forcing it out into pointless treacle territory. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Gee whiz, it's Spielberg's worst movie yet!","Although I've never much liked Steven Spielberg's films  (*Jaws*  being the sole exception), I've never confused my dislike with his ability to please a crowd.  The man is undoubtedly a showman . . . I suppose my quarrel is with what he shows us.  Even while despising his sentimentality, I've always grudgingly admired his sheer filmmaking competence.  In other words, I would never give his movies a 1/10 rating.Until now, until  *The Terminal*.  This is, without equivocation, the worst film of his career.  It has absolutely nothing to recommend it.  They should pay US to see it, really.  First of all, the movie has to set some kind of record for relentless product-placement.  You thought Hanks shilling for FedEx and Wilson Sporting Goods was tacky in  *Castaway*?  Wait till you see him scarf down his seventh Burger King greaseball sandwich in  *The Terminal*.  Wait till you watch him wander aimlessly, over and over, past Sbarro, Starbucks, Hugo Boss Outlets . . . but this is a hint to stop, because I don't want to be the pot calling the kettle black.  Basically, Spielberg & the Gang at Dreamworks came up with the most brilliant ""synergy""  concept yet:  base the story on some nut who was stranded in Charles de Gaulle Intl. Airport in France, make up a bunch of  ""dramatic, funny""  stuff about this character, and bingo! -- you got over 2 hours of CONTINUOUS ADVERTISING.  One retail outlet after another, panning slowly on the big screen.  Hanks can't escape the Terminal, and neither can the targeted audience!  It sometimes helps, when viewing a film, to know the reasons WHY a film gets made:  please remember that DreamWorks is having a bit of financial trouble, lately.  Not a LOT, but some.  The TV shows never materialized; the music-unit was sold off to some other conglomerate; and, worst of all, their movies have been stinking up the box-office for the past couple of years.  In fact, their last major  ""hit""  (if we must call it that)  was  *Gladiator*.Hence, *The Terminal*  gets dumped on an unsuspecting public.  Make no mistake, kids:  Spielberg did this hack-job with the hopes of covering his own studio's backside.  It is no coincidence that the only element in the film which looks as if any effort was applied is the set of the airport terminal itself.  Indeed, it's an astounding set, the best of its kind ever built, and deserves an Oscar . . . but remember the set's main function:  to hawk Starbucks and the like.  And since this is the movie's main function (with the  ""entertainment""  part hopefully taking care of itself under the auspices of popular showmen like Spielberg and Hanks), it should really come as no surpise that the airport-set is awesome.  There's money to be made, and burgers to be sold.As for the other aspects of the movie -- you know, the stuff we usually talk about, like the direction, photography, acting, story, and so on -- only the most pedestrian efforts are exerted from the principals  (Spielberg, Hanks, Zeta-Jones).  In the direction category, you would never guess that Spielberg was behind the wheel.  The story has terrible pace, the camera-work is nondescript  (except when panning slowly across yet another advertiser's logo), and the script is devoid of the  ""magical moments""  the director has occasionally pulled off in his other films.  In the acting category, Stanley Tucci tries his damnedest to give an honest performance as the head of security at the terminal, but the script betrays him by making his character, for no clear reason, more villainous as the movie wears on. Tucci's hung out to dry, mouthing dialogue.  As for Hanks and Zeta-Jones: watching them here only made me consider how much I enjoyed them in separate films by the Coen Brothers  (*Intolerable Cruelty*  for Z-J; *The Ladykillers*  for Hanks).  I ended up wishing that I was watching either one of those films again, which, not surprisingly, were directed by artists instead of a huckster.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Turned a fascinating story into complete drivel,"It's a shame that Spielberg transformed Mehran Karimi Nasseri's real life nightmare into a sappy love story with a happy ending.Nasseri was an Iranian who sought political asylum in Britain, but lost his visa while in transit. Britain forced him to return to his previous connection in France, where for eighteen years he attempted to wade through bureaucracy and even a short stint in prison.Except for a couple of months in jail (it may have been less), he resided at the airport the entire time, ordering the same exact meals from the airport's Burger King each day. He loved economics and became extremely well-versed in it during his stay.A lawyer at last was able to help Nasseri obtain legal status. Nasseri, who claimed to be the son of a British mother and Persian father, refused to sign a document with Mehran Karimi Nasseri written on it, but insisted it read Sir Alfred Mehran -- his 'true' name. He subsequently returned to the airport.So the story is really much darker, with a touch of mental illness involved. The fact that this was even allowed to happen, and that a sick man was not tended to for so long is where the real drama lurks. Mehran was eventually sent to a French halfway house after spending almost two decades on the same bench.Spielberg, felt he had to anglicize Mehran and transform him into essentially Andy Kaufman from Taxi. It became a quirky little film rather than something that could have been more akin to A Beautiful Mind with a touch of bureaucratic torture involved. Maybe someone could have told the story correctly and intelligently, though I doubt they will in fear of copying Spielberg's bastardization of the man's life.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Viktor against indifference,"This movie is an absolutely excellent one. Why ? Because it reflects life and its difficulties with amazing psychology. I was moved by this story because I think that only if you ever were in a ""state of need"" you would resort to all the inner resources that make you a creative person. And so is the character of the movie. Viktor has everything against him : indifference, above all. Yet, his faith, his optimism, his commitment to a promise he had made, will surface the best of his qualities and make him a winner. His greatest victory is against indifference. His unwillingness to judge others is a sign of great maturity and spiritual depth. Viktor can be any of us, in a given difficult context. How would we react ? Screaming against injustice; taking out a gun and shooting; or accepting what we cannot change and actively trying an honest way out ? Spielberg and Hanks say the latter is the solution.

He then stays up all night and finds the tools and materials to build a monument of love for her in the form of a huge fountain.

The wonderful Spielberg's movie.,"The terminal tells of Victor Navorski (Tom Hanks) is a man who wants to go to the United State but he's stuck in the airport because his country has a war and this makes him no country no nationality and can't let him entry to America. He needs to live in the airport without the money and needs to go to America because of some very important reason. Between he finds a way to survive this strange new environment he got new friends, they're the employee at the airport and they will help together to pass this story. He meets up a lot of situations that make his relationship with the people in the airport is better and he found love from the air hostess (Catherine Zeta-Jones) that works in there.The terminal was inspired by the true story of Merhan Nasseri, he's an Iranian refugee that he landed at the airport in the Paris, then he was denied into England because his passport and United Nations refugee certificate had been stolen. He chooses to live in the terminal because he doesn't want to go back to Iran. He's stuck in an airport for 18 years and lastly, in August 2006 he left the terminal to be hospitalized for an unspecified illness. This was an incredible story that I just know but the movie did a pretty job with it by Steven Spielberg makes this movie have more details and interesting at the same time from any scene. This character is very suitable for Tom Hanks, sometimes it made me think about Forrest Gump that Victor and Forrest, they look kind, naive but smart and very talented. There are friendly and have good friends and really love their family and the thing that I like them is they need someone to understand and live a life together. Even though in those movies the hero is disappointed in love with the heroine but the heroine has fills in with the good things for the hero.This movie made me really heartwarming when the first time that I watch and I still remember those feeling. The scene and the character made the movie's vibe is good. I'm saying that the Terminal is recommendable, it's a very enjoyable film that you didn't need to think too much just sit and relax to have fun with this movie and you will get a good thought from any characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
you won't want it to terminate,"I was surprised when I learned that ""The Terminal"" was based on a true story, but the movie did a pretty neat job with it (well duh, it involves Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks). The plot of course has Viktor Navorski (Hanks) coming to the US from the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia when he gets stranded in the airport. The rest of the movie has him getting acquainted with various people in the airport and wondering what will become of everything now.It's a simple idea, but they know how to do some neat things with it. Above all, it shows that Tom Hanks not only is one of the greatest actors of our time, but is one of the few who can put on a believable accent. Maybe they didn't need the love affair with Catherine Zeta-Jones, but otherwise it's pretty good. Stanley Tucci's character is likely to make your skin crawl.

Or at the end, when Victor Navosky is on the taxi and answers to the driver that he wants to go home. I think that a real taxi driver would become a little angry listening to Navosky's destination!So, I think the movie would have been better if Spielberg had followed the romantic comedy rails.

"Somehow, I came out of the theater and rated it an 8/10","Where do I start with this one?  This is a movie that one can easily pick apart for any number of reasons, all argued persuasively on this site...everything from the annoying product placements or integrations, hokey story lines, underdeveloped characters, changes in tone and character motivations ...Looking back on the movie, it is far from perfect, and yet....As I watched it, The Terminal earned a certain good will, and I did willfully suspend my disbelief for it.  I give Tom Hanks much of the credit for this  (Who else could've pulled this off?  Robin Williams, Jim Carrey, I don't know) because if you don't like his character and if you can't see the movie through his eyes, this movie will go nowhere (no pun intended on his Victor's plight).  The other acting was fine: I happen to think CZ-Jones is very talented and not only beautiful, and she did fine with what she had to work with.  The almost romance btwn her and Hanks is just okay.  The support from Tucci and the rest is on the whole. very strong.A couple more observations:  To me, the comedy worked so much better in this movie than the gravity.  I thought that the scene where Victor is called in to calm down a passenger is heavy-handed, the 'quickie-marriage was a bad end to a decent story line, and Gupta's surrender was also too shrill a momentBut having said all that, if I rated it element by element, it may get a 6/10 at best ...but as I watched it, it was an ""8"", for Hanks, for his support and for a few great laughs!

Question,"I saw this movie a couple of times and really liked it, especially the acting. Tom Hanks is brilliant and the rest of the cast is very good, too. The first time I watched it, I was more focussing on the difficulty of Navorski's situation and the sad and sometimes cruel aspects it has. On the second viewing however, what struck me was Navorski's rather anarchic streak in adjusting to the situation.There is one thing that really puzzles me, though: Where are all the other people who must have been on the same flight from Krakozhia?

Katherine Zeta Jones is accused of being ""wooden,"" but that is part of her character, and it helps sell her decisions.

Heartwarming and compassionate Spielberg strikes again,"The premise is inspired on a true event of an Iranian refugee that lived in a Paris airport for 18 years. It makes you put yourself in Victor's shoes and feel for his situation. It makes you wonder what it would be like if you were in another country where you couldn't speak or understand the language. It's great social commentary on American culture and bureaucracy. The part where he figures out that if he returns a cart and gets a quarter then starts buying Burger King meals was great. The movie feels kind of surreal at times, almost like a dream. Like one of those backrooms or nostalgic places that don't exist. I think it's the way Spielberg decided to film it, it's kind of weird. At times it has this yellow tint for no reason which I found off-putting.It's sincere and heartwarming but also falls into being kind of sappy - something Spielberg tends to do in his movies. A comedy/drama movie about compassion, perseverance and understanding. It's about America: the Land of Opportunity.Now, the problem I have with this movie is the way it's presented. It's done in a playful, innocent and humorous way and it makes the whole thing feel unrealistic and naive. It pulled me out of the seriousness of the whole situation and made me not take it seriously. But then again, this movie is about the inspiring and heartwarming message it's trying to convey. It's not the most captivating or gripping story, but it's pretty entertaining and funny. The characters are also likable, so there's that as well. It's an enjoyable watch that anyone can get into. Unfortunately, the movie failed to make an impactful or meaningful impression on me so I don't think I'll be watching it again.

Inspired by the true story of an Iranian man,This was inspired by the true story of an Iranian man stranded for years at the Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. Search it and you will see. I guess Spielberg decided that an Eastern-European man at the JFK airport would be a more interesting story for the mostly American viewers.Tom Hank is a fabulous actor. He saves the day anytime. He was able to be his great self who can make you laugh and cry at the same time. Cast Away and Forrest Gump are examples that bear witness to that.7/10 from me. It could have reflected the real story and also been given more purpose and meaning (the plot as a whole).,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Terminally bad - the worst film of the finest of directors,"I simply shocked this kind of stuff ever made through the normal challenges of script-committees or approving executives. Unless Spielberg paid this 100% of his pockets, because man, he is off his rockers. 1. Badly mixed genres 2. Frank Caprish idiotic characters 3. credibility less of cartoon 4. complete illogical scenes and plot twists 5. Really really bad acting 6. Awful casting 7. As a product -no audience, no quality, except form of set setting excellence 8. Really bad script and misen-scene directionIssues of the real-life feel of JFK' the fact that it's set in today's NYC, the misunderstanding of how a foreign would grasp English or would behave, the obscene simplicity of the foreigner (almost ""racist"" is it's assumptions about the simple-minded idiot (we are the only idiots to have wasted 8 Euros on this ""movie""), and then it just tops it when bona fide UMDB users hail this with any word of grace. If it didn't say SP on the director's field, and Hanks wasn't there - this would be the trashed and grinded to pieces to have ever shamed talents like Williams and yes, Spielberg himself. Artistic does not mean allegorically silly, and it is embarrassingly silly. It is SO silly that you won't believe your eyes. I have seen directorial debuts, when a new director lumps in improbable plot and sticks a metaphor in the end. And nicely written ones, as used in The Shawshank Redemption is tolerable with the depth it suggests - but this is just so far far in the air, you just want your money back. Wow. I am so disappointed!",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Appropriately titled.,"This movies is appropriately titled the terminal, because it is a terminal movie, as in terminally bad, and I mean that as in many ways. But it was decent at some parts, I'll give it that, it was better than some of Steven Spielberg's other movies, but not quite as good as his best movies. It would have been better if he had put more flying in it, which would have been appropriate since it took place in an airport. But by flying, I mean flying like in the movie Hook, not like in Saving Private Ryan, I mean like magical flying, because at least that way something more interesting could have been happening on the screen.Tom Hanks stars as Viktor Navorski, a Russian man with a bad Russian accent.He is stuck in the airport, because of some political malfunctioning, but not to worry, because he is stuck in the airport with some interesting people. The supporting cast includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Chi McBride, and Kumar Pallana all in supporting roles. This was a pretty good role for Tom Hanks, but he definitely shouldn't get any awards for it, because it wasn't his best work, or even as good as his best work. Also, I don't like how Tom Hanks keeps playing older characters, because he did his best work when he played younger people, like in Big, Bosom Buddies, and Burbs. I know your probably saying, but he's getting older, but there's make-up for that, just look at how young Tobey Maguire looks in most of his films.But the rest of the supporting cast do good jobs too, for the most part at least. I wasn't too fond of Chi McBride, because he always looks the same in every TV show and movie he does, he's always playing a big black man who is in some sort of position. But his name bothers me too, because mostly I think it sounds like a girl's name. McBride for one thing sounds like a girl, cause as we know, only girls can be brides, except for in San Francisco, but he doesn't seem to be that type of bride, if you know what I mean. And then his first name I just can't pronounce. Speaking of last names, why didn't Catherine Zeta-Jones change her last name when she got married. She could've been Catherine Douglas, but then I don't think it's good for people to have last names as first names anyways. But if she really loves her husband and isn't just with him for his money and looks, then maybe she could have at least hyphenated it, like Zeta-Jones-Douglas, but I'm not too fond of hyphenated names in the first place, except for Sarah Michelle-Gellar. But Kumar Pallana was good and funny in the movie too.Anyway, I won't give away the ending, even though it's not surprising at all, but it's still better than the ending of some of Spielberg's other movies, like Jurassic Park, where the Pterodactyls were flying away in the end. But I did like that flying, too. Maybe this movie would've been better if it had real dinosaurs in it, instead of just Tom Hanks, who is starting to look like one, but only a small one that looks like a human. Maybe then this movie wouldn't have been such terminal garbage.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Spielberg and Hanks are a golden team,"Before I watched this film I was expecting a good mvoes with a few comdey scenes. Then I saw this film... And it was such an excellent film !! Tom Hanks was outstanding, almost every character seem to have a story and meaning and is not just a person who walks in the background and the dialog is interesting and so meaningful. The drama that was created throughout the film was absolutely great, the comedy scenes were hilarious, and the movie was so enjoyable I'm definitely gonna watch it again soon. Overall, this film is for the Tom Hanks fans, the Spielberg fans, for those who love comedy films and for those who like dramatic comedy films. This movie shows that Hanks and Spielberg have an outstanding chemistry. If this movie's underrated, then it's one of the moest underrated comedy films ever.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Good.,"I liked ""The Terminal"", don't get me wrong, it was a cute movie with plenty of charm (to be filed with ""Catch Me If You Can"", ""E.T."" etc) but I'm thinking Monsieur Steven Spielberg is due a BIG film with the acclaim that surrounded the likes ""Schindler's List"", ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"".Tom Hanks is probably the finest actor around right now (subject to opinion) I see him as our generations Cary Grant or James Stewart! I thought the 'accent' would annoy me during this film but I was wrong it was fine.FACT: People dislike Catherine Zeta-Jones FACT: People will not see this film because Catherine Zeta-Jones is in it ... It's like why people didn't watch ""Jersey Girl"" because Jennifer 'Anaconda' Lopez was in it ... It's a shame because Z-Jones isn't in ""The Terminal"" that much at all and her her input is okay aswell! The entire supporting cast in this film are very good, Stanley Tucci is a damn good actor!This is a fine film that yes can be considered ""Lovey-Dovey""(!) but Spielberg creates something more than a romantic comedy here but a whole community!!!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Rent it...,"This would make a great rentable movie... I paid $10 to see it in the theater and it wasn't that great. However, Tom Hanks did an awesome job. There are a lot of funny moments in the movie, just maybe not worth $10/person. I think Catherine Zeta-Jones was good in this movie, she made her character believable. And then the Stanley Tucci was very good, too. There are some very slow parts, making you wonder why you care. But all in all, you do care for the character and his plight to go into New York City.Finally, I would recommend reading the true story about an Iranian man living in Terminal 1 at CDG airport in Paris so far for 14 years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great and Iconic,This was and still is a great and Iconic movie from the 1 and only Steven Spielberg. The more I watch it the more I love it. Nobody could have played the part better than Tom Hanks as Victor Navorski.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Simple but quite charming!,"Although I never expect The Terminal, directed by the all-time genius Steven Spielberg, to feature bombastic special effects and create major attraction amongst the audience, this little gem turns out to be surprisingly funny and heart-warming compared to most movies I have seen this year. The plot is slightly more of a parody of Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away: Tom Hanks was once stranded in an unknown island. In The Terminal, he's once again stranded, this time however, in an airport in New York City.Viktor Navorski (the role that Tom plays) comes to America to accomplish one thing that his father has requested before he died but due to conflicts and government overthrow in Krakozhia, his visa and passport are no longer valid in the US, forcing him to stay put within the terminal. To make matters worse, Navorski's English proves to be a pain in the neck, often causing misinterpretations and confusion. But there lies the brilliance of Tom Hanks: every gesture and expression he made in each scene is naturally flawless and hilarious. As in any Spielberg film, the editing is smooth, the camera angles are creatively used in a rather dynamic way and of course, bits and pieces of clever gags to make sure that the audience don't get bored easily. If some speak of some miscast in this movie, well, that may be half true. Catherine Zeta Jones plays her role nicely, Stanley Tucci fits the role of the 'villain' extremely well and the rest manage to give The Terminal a sense of magic even if it isn't obviously there.I just only hope if Mr. Spielberg spends more time with the romantic relationship between Tom and Catherine but the rest of the production is plain exceptional. Overall, The Terminal is a perfect choice for lovers out there, including those in the airport.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"An adventure we have all taken, before taking off into the clouds","Tom Hanks gets stuck in New York city terminal when a coup takes place in his country. I love the realism the first half of the movie has; the everyday struggle he goes through to survive. But this changes half way through into fantasy, the plane takes off and reality gets left behind. Giving in to the fantastical romantic element and creating a villain when really there shouldn't be one. Apart from this change in storytelling the movie is pretty lovable, what bad things can you say about Tom Hanks? Excellent soundtrack by John Williams.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Painful,"Victor Navorksi (played by Tom Hanks), a man from the Eastern European nation of Krakozhia, flies into JFK airport. At Customs he is forbidden entry to the USA - Krakozhia has been taken over in a coup and the US does not currently recognise the new regime, or nation. In addition, the borders of Krakozhia are now closed. This leaves Victor in limbo - he cannot enter the US or go back to Krakozhia. While waiting for the diplomatic situation to sort itself out he is forced to live in the International Transit section of JFK, living off his own resourcefulness. He also makes some new friends along the way.Painful to watch. The movie had heaps of potential as a wry look at diplomacy and international politics and how it affects everyday people. Instead director Steven Spielberg tries to make this thought-provoking situation into a comedy.Not that it's funny. Well, maybe if you're 10 years old, it's funny, but if you've got a developed sense of humour or any degree of intelligence, it's not funny at all. 10-year-olds do seem to be the target market as the ""humour"" is corny and involves cultural stereotypes, no-speak-English farce and other cheap shots.Continuing the made-for-kids theme, the movie quickly regenerates into a poor downtrodden hero vs all-powerful bad guy caper. Pity that the ""bad guy"", the head of security for JFK, is actually trying to help Victor, while doing his job. He gives Victor ample opportunities and avenues to improve his situation but Victor is too stupid to take them. Yet Spielberg makes him the bad guy and Victor the good guy.There is also a romantic drama element to this. Once again, it's more kids' fantasy than anything approaching reality. The catering guy-customs woman story was very stupid and contrived. The Victor- air hostess story was a bit more realistic, but very trite.Tom Hanks delivers easily his most irritating performance, laying on the faux Russian accent and no-speak-English shtick so thick that it is impossible to like Victor.Then we have inconsistencies in character behaviour, sub-plots that go nowhere, random stuff that just happens to sort out a situation, cheesy sentimentality. The only times I liked the movie were when Victor showed some resourcefulness (eg the baggage trolleys/25c).What a mess.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Spielberg and Hanks ought to have their heads examined,"It's hard to imagine why two exceptional talents would combine to produce a film like this. In the beginning I thought the concept was intriguing, and there were a few good laughs about Hanks' character misunderstanding the bad situation he was in because of his almost nonexistent English. After that, the film went downhill fast and the jokes became obvious and repetitious. Catherine Zeta-Jones, as a neurotic and self-destructive stewardess, appears several times as the love interest, but instead of appealing to our sympathies, just looked like someone Hanks would be better to stay away from. It's a disappointment and a waste of time",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
I'd Hoped For Forrest Gump,"The Terminal is a good movie, but only because Tom Hanks is so bloody entertaining when he has a character to play whom you fall in love with at first sight. In this case, that's Viktor Navorski.Catherine Z-J is not particularly believable as a United Air Lines flight attendant who can't make up her mind. In that regard, the characters are a bit like Forrest and Jenny, but you could like Jenny as a person. You definitely don't like Amelia.In the first half of the movie, Stanley Tucci was mostly likable, but then he grew confused about who he wanted to be, too.The standout ""goofball"" in the movie was Kumar Pallana, who played Gupta, a lovable Indian janitor who had a perverse sense of humor, a surprising talent or two, and a strong sense of doing the right thing.I guess what bothered me the most about the movie was that only one person (Amelia) ever asked Viktor (Tom) why he wanted to come to New York City. His reason for being there was something that one of his buddies could easily have taken care of during the months he spent living at JFK. In fact, once you find out why he was there, you have to ask yourself whether he needed to be there at all.Hanks - 10; the movie itself - 6; averaged - I give it an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Without High Expectations, A Superb Movie","6 July 2004. In order to appreciate this movie fully, one must put aside the usual American romance expectations and just enjoy the movie, the acting, the fine nuance of humor and the ordinary life experiences that occur in a major airport terminal. This rather eccentric slice of life view of a man trapped by circumstance offers Tom Hanks one of his finest expanding roles to date and Catherine Zeta-Jones with a delightful character that we can identify with as well as the bittersweet message of the movie. The humanity capture in this microcosm of an airport and the promise to one's father further presents a optimistic view of man.

Much Better Than They Say!,"For a long time I avoided this film, quite irrationally reacting against the early hype in the way we all do sometimes. Then one day I saw it on cable when there was nothing else to watch, so I gave it a go. There is a pleasant joy about being proved wrong about a film, about the wry realisation that you have been stupid enough to delay enjoying a really interesting motion picture experience.What happens is that Hanks and Spielberg do what they have done countless times before - individually and collaboratively - and draw you in. All they need is the ability to create believable characters in an interesting real-life situation and a setting we all recognise. Sounds simple. It's not. But this film plays like a masterclass in how to do it.There is a lightness of touch about the film, exemplified by the incidental music and by Hanks' winning charm as the lead character who stays relentlessly positive in the face of the kind of un-feeling bureaucratic intransigence that is designed to wear people like him down. Despite all the odds, he never doubts that he is going to get into New York City, and so neither do we. And that spirit of belief that benign destiny will prevail slowly infects not only the rest of the airport, but the audience as well. To that extent, it's a 'feel good' movie.There are some lovely individual touches too (watch out for when Viktor gets X-rayed - and then photo-copied!), and Stanley Tucci's turn as the uptight, officious airport security manager becomes a wonderful comic creation, without ever losing authenticity. But there are serious themes here too, and they are not smothered in saccharine - except perhaps in the last 20 minutes (when let's face it, it's acceptable). Spielberg's class allows the film to effortlessly dip between the tragi-serious, the laughably mundane, and OK the downright silly at times, without ever losing its pace or the logic of its simple plot.There's not much more to say about this film without spoiling it. You don't need a deep understanding of international politics to understand it, just an interest in human beings and how they behave in reaction to the situations and people around them.Watch it. You'll like it. And you'll never look at an airport terminal in quite the same way again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"fun, but unrealistic and makes no sense at all","The Terminal is a fun movie, but has no real plot and lacks direction. The lack of a plot that makes any sense (it sort of has one, but a really dumb one) drags the movie out for longer than necessary. It has some very funny scenes, but just as many that really don't make any sense. Hanks puts on an unrealistic but funny character, including accent. I really hate it, though, when a movie is unrealistic. At least there should be a plausible idea behind what the characters do. Places and accents should be realistic. Don't make stuff up. Plus, does every movie have to have a love story? It's as if they have to throw one in there for good measure. This movie has more than one. And one ends up in a marriage after the first date. That's ridiculous. There's also a bad guy thrown in there for good measure.I've come to expect this kind of movie from Hollywood. Entertaining, but disappointing.

Contrived and over-sentimental,"I watched this on TV some years ago and did not like it. A few nights ago it was on again and I decided to give it another chance. Hanks plays Viktor, coming to America from a fictional Eastern European country and finding himself stranded at the airport.A revolution erupted in his country and his passport is confiscated. Instead of being deported or arrested and because of the maniacal behavior of the airport security supervisor, Viktor finds himself living in the terminal.Hanks plays Viktor with a heavy accent and mannerism, but does not manage to make his character sympathetic. An eccentric who does not want to divulge the reason for his journey, Viktor finds support from airport workers and gets mixed in their life. He also manages to carry on a very unlikely love story with beautiful flight attendant Amelia (Zeta-Jones), but the love story feels contrived at best.My idea of airport terminals is that they are the quintessential passing-through area. My idea of nightmare would be to be stuck in one, so for me it is impossible to understand why Viktor decides to stay rather than taking his chances by getting out. This is linked to the reason of this journey, but it is also very contrived.Claustrophobic, pointless and annoying, especially when we finally get the revelation of Viktor's purpose in New York – yet another over-sentimental cliché from Spielberg.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Started well...but tapered off...,"'The Terminal', the latest Hanks/Spielberg collaboration is an interesting, and strangely original tale of a Russian stuck at a New York airport. Tom Hanks plays the role of said Russian rather well, even down to the way he walks. He doesn't look too Russian, but of course most people know it's Tom Hanks, so perhaps that's a moot point. What starts as an interesting and amusing jaunt dissipates into sentimental mush, for no apparent reason either. From the two airport workers getting married 'within minutes', to the overbearing 'romantic' music that seemed to envelop viewers close to the ending, - it's as if Spielberg didn't know how to complete this one. One may argue 'well how would YOU complete this movie?'. I would simply respond that 'I have no idea. Perhaps this kind of movie shouldn't have been made?'. And maybe that's the problem. There wasn't enough meat here for the movie to be completed in its entirety. The audience I was with laughed fairly continuously throughout the movie up till the last twenty-or-so minutes where it went eerily quiet. It's a real shame there wasn't enough continuity in the story.(On a side-note, there was a lot of very iffy cinematography in this movie. For some reason, and it appeared intentional, there was a lot (and I mean a lot) of very soft-lighting. Stanley Tucci is literally enveloped in it when he walks into view during one scene in the airport, and the meeting of Hanks and Zeta Jones at the 'fountain'  hurt the eyes. That's just two examples.. Very odd.)Overall, a relatively enjoyable movie. It's a shame the ending left such a bitter taste in the mouth.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The Terminal,"First, I want to apologize for my bad English. So don't criticize me or disturb yourself by my English. I thank you very much. The reason that I write this comment, although my English isn't perfect, is the fact that ""The Terminal"" is really one of the best movies that there is.The movie begins in the Terminal, when Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) got picked up by the security. The reason is the fact that his country, Krakozhia, is in the progress of a revolution. This makes the passport of Viktor invalid. Not knowing what is happening, he says many times ""I go New York"". With some funny scenes he gets to know what is happening. After this there comes a long time of living in the airport.The director of the airport wants that he'll get out of this airport, but he can't do this without that Viktor makes a foul. Viktor does a lot of things in the airport, and makes himself home. After some times he makes friends, the progress in making these friend were always funny, but also dramatic, as one of the audience I felt very combined to him. He gets to know a woman, Amelia Jane Warren (Catherina Zeta-Jones) They become friends and maybe even.. With Amelia in the story, the story gets the factor love. Combined with the funny and dramatic part, it makes the story almost perfect. I must praise the scriptwriter; it really is a piece of masterwork.The actors, with Tom Hanks, Catherina Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci played really good in the movie. There wasn't any kind of hesitation or sign of unreality. I must praise even more about the actor skills of Tom Hanks, although he knows the English language better than me, he was able to make me believe that my skills in English were far more better than his. This is really astonishing.The music in the story also was very good and fitted very best in the movie. I can't have complaints about that.The ending of the story is..how should I say it..""perfect with some hesitations"". The first thing with the ending is that you'll see what kind of genius the scriptwriter is. It has a lot of symbolic thing, what makes watching the movie twice very attractive. The second thing is a personal thing..you'll collide it.In the end I want to tell you something about the making of the scenes, the audience will get the feeling that he is right now in the screen, in the airport. This is a really good achievement, for the director, Steven Spielberg.With the really perfect script (if there was an even stronger praise word I would use that) very skill full actors and good scenes. I give this movie a nine. I must warn you that, if you don't like comedy, love and drama, you must not watch this movie. But if you like one of these factors, I recommend you this movie. If you like two of these factors you must see it! And if you like all three of them..you'll have the time of your live, on my word.Cario Dally",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Unplausible but good,"Out of this unplausible story of a man forced to live in an airport for several weeks (or months?) because of a law gap, Spielberg makes a nice and humane movie with a few successful situation gags, a solidarity chain among simple people, a sentimental tale hidden in a peanut can and a few drops and romance between our man and an air hostess hit by existential troubles. Well you must also take for granted a few other unlikely things such as that despite the fact that when the main character came into the airport after landing, he practically didn't know a word of English, after a few days he talked passably well and that he managed to change the space of an airport door into a bedroom for him without nobody seeming to notice it for months.

No duty free,"The Terminal is a small scale film from Steven Spielberg. It is inspired by a true event but is really a fictionalised account.Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a traveller from Krakozhia who arrives at New York's JFK Airport only to find that his passport is cancelled due to a civil war in his homeland. He is left stateless and living at the airport terminal lounge because he cannot leave the airport and enter New York or be sent back home.Vicktor needs to find a way to survive at the terminal lounge, find a way to earn money for food for example, even learn English and pass the time day by day.Frustrating him is Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) the security chief at the terminal who just wants him to leave so he can be someone else's problem. As time goes by Viktor learns English, gets a job, earns money, makes friends with the staff even finds romance with a stewardess (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and confounds Dixon which makes him more angrier.Spielberg has made a Kafkaesque fantasy comedy and is helped by a likable performance by Hanks. They just about get away with this absurd premise helped by supporting characters such as Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana and Zoe Saldana (playing a Star Trek fan before she ended up with a major role in the Star Trek films.)If this had happened in real life, Vicktor would had been sent an immigration lawyer and an interpreter and would had got temporary admission to the United States.However Spielberg does lapse into schmaltz frequently in this film and Dixon is a weak token villain of the piece.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Heartfelt Journey of Endurance and Hope,"""The Terminal"" is a captivating tale of resilience and human connection set against the backdrop of an unlikely setting: an airport terminal. Directed by Steven Spielberg and featuring outstanding performances from Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta-Jones, this film offers a unique and heartfelt cinematic experience.At its core, ""The Terminal"" follows the journey of Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks), a visitor from the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia, who finds himself stranded at New York's JFK International Airport due to unforeseen circumstances. What unfolds is a story of endurance, hope, and the triumph of the human spirit as Viktor navigates the complexities of life within the confines of the terminal.One of the film's standout elements is undoubtedly the performances. Tom Hanks delivers a masterful portrayal of Viktor, imbuing the character with warmth, charm, and a quiet determination that resonates deeply with the audience. Catherine Zeta-Jones shines as Amelia Warren, a flight attendant whose encounters with Viktor spark unexpected connections and moments of reflection.The story itself is both captivating and heartwarming, offering a blend of humor, drama, and poignant moments of introspection. From Viktor's ingenious solutions to everyday challenges within the terminal to the relationships he forms with fellow travelers and airport staff, each aspect of the narrative is richly layered and thoughtfully explored.While ""The Terminal"" excels in many areas, there are moments where the emotional depth could have been further explored. Certain aspects of Viktor's personal journey could have benefited from additional nuance and development.Visually, the film is a treat for the senses, with Steven Spielberg's masterful direction bringing the bustling world of the airport terminal to life. The cinematography captures both the grandeur and the intimate moments of Viktor's journey, immersing the audience in his world and inviting them to experience the highs and lows alongside him.In conclusion, ""The Terminal"" is a touching portrayal of the resilience of the human spirit and the power of connection, set against the backdrop of a bustling airport terminal. With remarkable performances, heartfelt storytelling, and moments of genuine warmth and humor, it offers a cinematic experience that resonates long after the credits roll. While it may have benefited from further exploration of certain emotional aspects, the film's ability to capture the beauty of human connection in unexpected places makes it a journey well worth taking.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The king movie of all good times,Stephen Mendel is simply fantastic in this movie with an equally brilliant performance by Carl Allacchi. Though the performance by Kevin Ryder was not up to class mark it is well made up by Holly Traister whose portrayal of her role balances the evil in the world. Due to some brilliant make up by Zoltan Elek and Thomas Real this movie becomes as good as a good make out. Greg Loskorn has lived up to his expectations once again and so has Toby Newell in all the perfect movie ever and the most scintillating movie made in the 2nd and 3rd millennium. Ill give it an 11 on 10. This movie is bigger than the world trade center.Stephen Mendel is simply fantastic in this movie with an equally brilliant performance by Carl Allacchi.

Hanks makes a convincing Russian!,"Anything Tom Hanks touches, turns to gold. The Terminal is yet another hit in his incredible filmography. Spielberg and Hanks have worked together before (SPR, CMIYC). We're definitely in safe hands. Viktor Navorski (Hanks) is a Russian man stuck in limbo. The terminal at JFK, New York becomes his home for the foreseeable future. He's not allowed to enter the country or go back to Russia, due government collapse. Viktor strives off the basics; collecting trolleys for quarters, gathering intel for a man in love and having to deal with the jealous manager Frank (Stanley Tucci). Viktor and Catherine Zeta-Jones's constant traveller fail to spark any believable affection, as time is cut short between them, and their opposites barely attract. Hanks is a class beyond reach, but a harmless story doesn't grant him space to bloom.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Welcome to the United States of America,"""The Terminal"" refers to the JFK International Arrivals terminal in NYC. Tom Hanks (Victor Navorski) arrives at the beginning of the film from the fictional east European country of Krakosia. Unfortunately for him, while he was in the air, Krakosia underwent a coup and his passport is no longer valid for entry into the US. He is a ""man without a country.""Victor speaks little English, and is denied entry into the US. He is told to ""wait"" in the International Arrivals terminal until it can be straightened out. Again, unfortunately for Victor, this will take many months, and he must learn to live in, and survive in, an airport terminal.Needless to say, all those among us who have suffered through flight delays and cancellations can relate to Victor's problems. At least when I get stuck in an airport, though, I can speak the language.I could give you a little more plot, but frankly, you already have most of it. You don't need much more information to get the messages here. Those would be:1. Sometimes you have to wait for what you want. Victor is a very patient guy. Catherine Zeta-Jones (Amelia Warren, perpetually single flight attendant), not so much. He's a better person for his patience. She has waited forever for her married lover, but will never get what she wants. And she is decidedly unsettled and unhappy as a result.2. Sometimes you have to forget the rules, stop being a bureaucrat, and think about the people and the lives you touch. Victor knows this. And we can learn something from him.Tom Hanks is the new Jimmie Stewart. He is literally ""everyman."" As an actor, he conveys more emotion in a foreign language than most actors with a full vocabulary and a convincing script. Of course, he has done this before. In CastAway he doesn't even speak for most of the film. But he conveys every conceivable emotion, every conceivable thought, all non-verbally. He is one of the most gifted actors you will see.Steven Spielberg is not particularly well known for making films like ""The Terminal."" There's no eye popping special effects. There's no ghosts, no sharks, no evil forces. It's basically Tom Hanks and the ""interminal"" waiting we all do. Not typical, but very well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Give it a chance....it can happen,"I finally watched this on DVD. I wanted to see it in theaters but never made it because I heard it bashed by people more often than not. I think people expected it to be poignant and extraordinarily believable. While it is not necessarily poignant or highly likely to happen, I did find it touching and, yes, believable.Before this movie came out, I saw a 20/20 that showed a man in this real-life situation. He was in limbo because for some reason he couldn't return to his country (a fugitive??) but he hadn't the appropriate documents to enter the U.S.So yes, I can believe it.I realize this isn't a ""Schindler's List,"" but it is a nice little gem with a good story, good acting, and a winning subtlety that I believe is overlooked by most of its critics. While the movie neither changed my life nor dazzled me with awesome special effects, a lot of the wordplay and slapstick humor made me laugh out loud, while other moments made my eyes well up with tears.Please give this movie a chance. I really think it's worth a glance or more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

WARNING: VERY POOR-QUALITY FILM DESPITE THE POSITIVE COMMENTS,"I have just read the comments regarding this horrendous film called The Terminal. It proves that Spielberg, Hanks, and Zeta-Jones must have a million relatives who belong to IMDb. Anyone who sees this film and actually likes it knows nothing about film quality, casting, screenwriting, editing, musical score, and characterization. This film is a joke, and the makers of it are laughing at you if you saw it and said that you liked it. This film has no credibility. The music is dreadful. The actors are miscast. The screenplay is laughably stupid and on a 7th grade intelligence level. The ending is unbelievably stupidly written. It has so many flaws that one can tell that the movie-makers did not care in the least about something called EXCELLENCE. This film shouts, ""We don't care, but you idiots will like it anyway."" What else can I say to warn people off? If you see it despite my warning, and you hate it, make sure you warn others by commenting here on IMDb. Remember that.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Amazing!,"This movie is awesome. Right now I'm going to be writing an essay on ethics and morality and this movie came to mind. But when I looked it up, I was surprised to see so many negative comments.This movie was great. I know many people say that but hear me out. I usually find something wrong with any movie: point out plot faults, notice discrepancies etc. And I'm not saying that this movie was flawless. What I'm saying, is that this was the only movie that I have watched in a long while that I thought was, plainly put, 'amazing.' I don't really go to the movies, preferring to watch everything when it comes out on VHS or DVD. And when I do go, I only go once. This was the only movie ever that I went to see twice. It might be nothing to some people but to me it says a lot.I think everyone should see it because I believe that it will become a classic as years go by. Inside this simple, seemingly predictable movie, is an inspirational and thought-provoking situation. We experience both joy and sorrow, unexplained fear and childish delight, as we follow Tom Hanks through his stay at the terminal. This movie speaks out to its viewers in a way that can not be described, just felt. I cried when I saw the movie - which says a lot as well.I understand that people are entitled to their own ideas - that's the principle that I live by. But to name this movie as the worst, the baddest and the most plain is to do it greatest injustice. This movie has many lessons in it: one of them to never give up and, to quote Shakespeare, ""to thy own self be true.""So, to finish this, I urge everyone to see this movie (and for those who didn't like it the first time - to see it again ;-)) and judge it not for its 'stupid' jokes and plain scenes, but for its deeper meaning.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A movie with a message,"This was one wonderful movie and deserves a lot of introspection. It brings out several subtle but powerful messages throughout its course..The ""Terminal"" that Navorski is stuck in symbolizes the world we live in and the time he spends there symbolizes Life itself.The movie's strongest message is that ""Life itself is one long wait amidst its various activities and experiences"" and hence ""Patience is the virtue of life"".Most of us have faced situations where life has reached a dead-end and we feel entangled in the web of problems and miseries of life. This is symbolized by Navorski's predicament at the Terminal. Frustration is not an answer, nor is running away or ""escaping"" it. The solution is to accept the Reality of the situation and adapt our life accordingly by handling all of life's problems with a sense of duty, by putting in our best efforts and leaving the rest to take its own course. Navorski does exactly this during his stint at the ""Terminal"".Another important message he brings out is that Humanity and Love are the basis of all life and all of our actions need to be based on these principles.Navorski shows this in ample measure by his compassion for fellow human beings and in the end is ready to sacrifice his goal and his wishes for the well-being of his friends.In short, Navorski exemplifies an ideal human being.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Loved the airport survival stuff, but....","The Terminal is, at the same time, one of my favourite movies that I've seen this year, and a partial disappointment. It just further proves that there has yet to be a single movie released this year without considerable flaws. I don't want this to come across like a negative review because I really did enjoy The Terminal a lot.This is obviously a great premise. The movie jumps right into things with Victor being detained, Victor having communication problems as they try to inform him that he has no country, and of course, as you already know if you've seen the trailer or any TV spots, Victor is forced to stay in the airport. The scenes that played the best, the moments that I felt were the best of the movie, all happen in the first hour. All the scenes of Victor adjusting to life in the airport was enough for me. The segment with him returning the carts for quarters was the point when the movie seriously took off. All the way through his quest to find a job, the movie really had me won over. Those airport survival scenes were more than enough to hold together this movie. I wonder why The Terminal needed to introduce a love story (if you can call it that) and formulaic elements near the end. It's the introduction of these things that lost me. This was an interesting and moderately original entry in Speilberg's career before he decided that it needed a formulaic story. Stanley Tucci's character that's constantly out to get Victor, that was just typical and lame. And call me crazy, but I think this movie could have done without the love story. Very out of place, not to mention the fact that this ""love story"" never goes anywhere. There's a very unfulfilling end to it. I also don't see the point of the twist where Victor gets the temporary Visa. That idea was dropped from the movie and never used. It was a waste of time that overly-complicated things. I wasn't too crazy about the final showdown as Victor tries to leave the airport. It would've been corny even in a Frank Capra movie. That's the major problem here. Spielberg started it out as a movie based in reality, and half way through he turned it into an almost fairy tale Capra movie.But, minus these complaints, like I said at the start, this was one of my favourite movies of 2004. It also enforced my belief that 2004 is a year when everything will disappoint, even on a small scale. Tom Hanks puts on a great show. He always does. Some of the supporting cast is good, but the characters are poorly handled. I liked the very last scene of the movie. I loved Janusz Kaminski's Cinematography. He's one of the only DP's that's daring enough to blind the audience with light. I really loved John Williams score, as always. The biggest praise I will give is for the scene where Victor translates for the crazy Russian. Every contribution to the execution of that scene was perfect. That was a memorable cinematic moment. I wish the last 30 minutes had that kind of delivery. I do believe that Spielberg is one of the most consistent Directors working today, and he does direct The Terminal well, however I can't help but fantasize about what this movie would have been like had Andrew Niccol handled it, like he was originally supposed to. I have a feeling Andrew Niccol would have brought a lot more originality and focus overall.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An enjoyable film but a lost opportunity.,"The one thing that struck me as truly bizarre about this entire film was the fact that DreamWorks never actually used the original story details that they (reportedly) shelled out around $250,000 for. As the old adage goes, ""true life is stranger than fiction"", and in the case of Mr. Merhan Karimi Nasseri, the (former) Iranian citizen who is the unsung hero of the real-life story which inspired this work, that is absolutely the case. The most important part of any film is establishing credibility in the opening segment but the reworking of real-life events that the scriptwriters gave to this film was just not credible. This is a great, great pity as it is a truly remarkable sounding story about immigration bureaucracy and mistakes, stolen credentials, a human-rights court struggle, and a 16-year confinement to the international transit lounge of Paris' Charles De Gaulle airport.It's every film maker's prerogative to instil whatever political or emotional overtones that they see fit into their work. And Spielberg definitely left his overtones all over this film, from the grossly overdone syrupy schmaltz in some areas to the ""politically correct"" and fantasy-style portrayal of immigration at United States airports regarding detainees. I myself have been harassed, strip-searched, and the contents of my baggage overturned by United States immigration on numerous occasions just due to the colour of my skin and the fact my name looks ""indian"". So the portrayal that US immigration finally has ""compassion for the human plight"" was nigh-on insulting in the light of my own experiences.However, contrary to other reviews posted, I still believe that Spielberg spent a great deal of effort on the visual and audio realism that is the reason for his well-earned reputation. I also believe he had to make some very serious judgements about how to interpret events in a real-life story and about whether those events should even be portrayed in the film in the first place. The facts show that Mr. Nasseri indulged in political activity against his own country within the confines of the United Kingdom, and that the British Government later (unrelatedly) denied his application for citizenship based on his claims of British ancestry. So, given the potentially hazardous material there was to work with, I think Spielberg did a good job in finding the likable aspects of a character that could have easily been unfavourably viewed by audiences. He also did a very reasonable job in emphasising the fact that life has a little humour even in the darkest of situations, and it is this for me that made the film quite enjoyable overall. As for the actors, Tom Hanks's attention to detail in language and character was excellent (care of a Bulgarian dialect coach), though a little cheesy in places. And the other performances, particularly Stanley Tucci and Barry Shabaka Henley, were good given the script they had to work with.Of course, the one problem you have with dramatising any truly bizarre real-life story is that you have to bring it within the credible reaches of your target audience if they are to make the leap of faith on their part to connect with it. This is Spielberg's forte and in this film he created a work that was enjoyable and believable for cosy, suburban households without the entire concept being lost on them. However, having purchased the rights to a story about a living person, you have to wonder what drives a director to literally ignore real-life facts in favour of an almost completely unbelievable plot rewrite. In doing so, he squandered an opportunity to make a legendary film while, at the same time, trivialising the events that mentally all-but destroyed a man confined to a terminal building due to an unfortunate incident at a railway station followed by 16 years of bureaucratic red tape.Would I recommend this film as enjoyable viewing? Yes. Then I would recommend going to a news website and actually reading the real story. At the time of writing, The Guardian newspaper (UK) article ""The man who lost his past"" has a one year feature documentary about Mr. Nasseri. I guarantee you'll find the real-life version a lot more fascinating.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Airline food at the mall,"We went to see the film without any preconceptions and frankly, once we accepted the impossibility of this situation, we fell right under its spell. Yes, it's a bit long, yet it kept our attention until the end.I have no idea who pitched this tale to Mr. Spielberg. Evidently, the story is a far cry from reality to people like Viktor, in the situation he encounters upon arriving in New York. Viktor would have been held by the Immigration authorities, then processed, and sent to a detention center to wait for his appointment to see a judge, who ultimately would have decided his fate.No one in this situation would have been allowed to stay unguarded in the terminal, as in the case of this stateless man. Then again, we wouldn't have had a film, at all. The screen play twists the facts to adapt the story for a Tom Hanks vehicle.At the beginning it takes a while to adjust to Tom Hanks supposedly Russian accent. The inner life of the terminal is brought to life by the people that play minor roles in the movie.Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg make a great team. The director and its star compliment one another. Mr. Hanks is delightful as this man who, through no fault of his own, is stuck by the red tape encountered at his arrival in this country, at the present time.Catherine Zeta Jones' flight attendant is a fake. Ms Zeta Jones makes us like her, in spite of knowing she is as deep as a Danielle Steele novel. When this woman selects a Napoleon biography from the book store, many people laughed knowing a flight attendant and Napoleon are the equivalent of olive oil and balsamic vinegar.Stanley Tucci, Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana, add a comic relief to the film.The only remaining question is whether all the brands that are prominently displayed in the terminal, (this could have easily been a shopping mall), paid the film makers to have their brands displayed  in the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An easy watch,"I'd heard about the movie being inspired by real events, had Tom Hanks in a lead role, and was a sad story, I believed these elements would be sufficient to move me, but unfortunately, it wasn't. Wasn't as swayed nor sad nor heartbroken as I thought I would be. Fair warning, the movie is slow and since it's limited to the airport, the background is repetitive and well, crowded. The bit does seem more political than it claims to me, talking about the US customs rules, refuge policies and the justice system. It might be an easy watch, but it's no light one. I liked how all the supporting characters have their own stories, wonderfully woven together, not deviating from the central plot. The movie borderlines drama, romance and comedy in so many ways. A lot of the parts seem unbelievable, not in a good way. Is airport security really that lax? Can you truly just take down walls because you don't speak and understand English?One thing I truly disliked about the movie - Ad Placements. How many? How often?

It also has this warm feel of optimism, simplicity and satisfaction that our consumerist society has almost made extinct.Thanks to Spillberg for this beautiful movie which made my day.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"short but accurate review of ""The Terminal""","I saw this movie yesterday for free so I'm not complaining but yes it IS a sappy love story between Catherine Zeta-Jones and Tom Hanks.And an unbearably whimsical,unplausible and contrived dramedy that really tested my patience.What is it with Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg in recent years?It seems as if they are taking a vacation from doing their usual serious and worthwhile films and turning to lightweight mainstream commercial projects.I mean,first year's ""Catch Me If You Can"" of two years ago and now this.Apparently,there really was and still is a man stuck in Charles de Gaulle airport.Read the article written last year in the NY Times if you want to find out about it because this is the sentimentalized,bare bones of the original story,love interest thrown in Hollywood version.Victor Navorski is a tourist from Krakozhia coming to NYC for a reason not revealed until the end.(Throwback to the time films,especially the Marx brothers ones used to invent countries so not to offend anyone)The government in his country is overthrown while he is inflight and as the U.S doesn't recognize the new one,he has a passport from nowhere and can neither step on American soil or go back(is this possible?)He is ordered to stay inside the JFK terminal and one of the frustrating things about this movie is that he could actually leave anytime he wanted to.I mean,even the obligatory bureaucrat running security for the airport(Stanley Tucci)just wants Victor to run away,solving everyone's problem.In short,the premise doesn't hold water.And yes,he meets a beautiful but troubled flight attendant.And yes,the airport staff is assembled of colorful ethnic funny characters(paranoid Indian janitor,love-struck Mexican,black family ma,tough young black female security officer,sympathetic cops,etc.)And yes,the mean man ruining everyone's fun is ultimately defied and left screeching at the cameras as Victor marches out,followed by a cheering crowd.There is one good reason to see this movie,though,and one reason why I'm ultimately giving it a thumbs up:Tom Hanks.I'm a giant fan,always have been and this is one of his best performances.Some people may complain that he is once again playing his usual Everyman character or question the authenticity of his portrayal. As a person with Slavic immigrant parents,I can attest that there are men exactly like this in the world.Hanks hits all the right notes as an alien in a strange country who doesn't know English and has to communicate with body language.He captures all the mannerisms and quirks of a Victor Navorski.What a great actor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This film is beautiful...,"This film is a work of art, from beginning to end I loved the way Victor Neborski lived in the terminal... Even though I do not really like films based on true events that get the facts wrong, this one was great because not many people know that this is a true story. But when it really happened the man lived in the Terminal for 15 years. I loved everything about this film, especially the part at the end, it really makes you think that Victor has to go back without getting the autograph for his deceased father... But when he left the terminal to get the Jazz-mans autograph, Spielberg does a great job of doing exactly what the audience DOESN'T expect. Me, and my fellow viewers thought that the Jazz-man had died, or that when he told Victor to hold on for a minute, something would happen that would prevent him from getting the autograph...

"Good, but has too many weak parts.","Definitely one of Spielberg's lesser efforts, one that might play at the 2 AM slot on TCM when he dies. One wonders why he took this project; it seems more like something Robert Zemeckis might knock off. There are a couple of moments of such amazingly poor writing that you wonder if Spielberg, or even Tom Hanks, even read that page of the script. However, most of the film is a decent human comedy. A man from a made-up Eastern European country lands at JFK airport and finds out that his government has been overthrown. His passport and visa are unacceptable, and no one knows what to do with him. The head of the airport (Stanley Tucci) orders him to wait in the airport while they figure something out, only they never do. Hanks becomes a permanent resident there, becomes friends with most of the little people who work in the airport, and even courts a pretty flight attendant whom he runs into now and then (Catherine Zeta-Jones). It's all pretty fun, and even at times quite romantic (there's also a subplot where Hanks helps a young food delivery man win the heart of a woman on the airport security staff that is kind of sweet). I also like the way the film celebrates the melting pot that makes up America. It's a nice picture in a time of ever-rising insularity. Yet there are so many bits holding the film back. The screenplay really needed some editing. Hanks carries around a peanut jar through the whole movie. We are told fairly early that it does not contain peanuts, and so the audience knows that a big surprise is coming. When we actually find out, it's quite lame, and, metaphorically, this part of the film just doesn't work. And, strangely, there's this one character who works a lot towards bringing the movie down a peg or two. The character of Gupta seems to ruin the movie. His backstory is melodramatic and not fit for this story, he's a paranoid, sadistic jerk (he is the janitor, and he washes the floors just so people will slip on them), and he provides the movie with the silliest deus ex machina imaginable. That's not to mention the actor, Kumar Pallana, is a horrible actor. This film is actually inspired by the true story of an Iranian man who became stranded at a Parisian airport after his briefcase, which contained his passport and everything he owned, was stolen. The original story is much more interesting than The Terminal. A movie has already been made in France about it, but it hasn't been seen much outside of that country. I think the real story would make a great film. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Silly movie, despite its good intentions","Despite that this movie has a heartwarming undertone, my cynical side just can't cope with this ultra-sweet film that tries to deliver a true message on a wrong way.The protagonist, a refugee being stuck on an airport due to inhumane bureaucracy, is a totally clichéd version of a real immigrant. He doesn't have anything in common with anyone really wanting to build up a life in the United States. And that's my biggest problem with this movie, the total lack of any realism in the main character played by Tom Hanks. At the end we see his true reason to go to the U.S.A. and believe me if I say that it's an anti-climax of epic proportions to see the silly reason of why this guy has to endure all this pain to set foot on American soil. Add up the completely senseless love-story around Catharina Zeta-Jones, as always being too artificial with her stunning beauty but failure to act natural, and you get a very silly movie.But like I said in my introduction, it has an important message to give to its audience. I also believe that immigrants build up America, and the rest of the western world for that matter, and that they should be cherished for their efforts instead of despised as happens too often. In Holland we recently had a political wave that tried to tune down Immigracy. It created a lot of sad stories of people that build up a living in our country but had to leave due to inhumane bureaucrats. This being said, I must add that positive stories about immigrants are important to tell.

What Are You Waiting For?,"Viktor Navorski is on his way into New York City when he is told that his country has been annexed from the inside- It no longer technically exists. It seems that this has placed him in a ""crack"" in the system- There is nothing that Head of Airport Security Frank Dixon can do but let him live in the airport terminal- So that is what Viktor Navorski does: He lives.The story here is truly the star of the show. Through his foreign eyes Viktor allows us to see the irony of our rushed and ridiculous American lives. He also changes the lives of just about everyone he meets. As Viktor himself discovers, everyone is waiting for something; everyone has something they're yearning for in their life. Yet it is those of us who stop waiting and just soar who truly are happy.And much thanks for that has to be given to the amazingly talented cast. Tom Hanks is brilliant as Viktor; You know it's a great performance when you completely forget about the actor and just see the character. Catherine Zeta-Jones is spot-on as a truly selfish and love-desperate woman who has realized what love really is for the first time. Stanley Tucci is excellent once again. However, it is Kumar Pallana as the janitor who reluctantly befriends Viktor who stole the show for me. Really, there's not a bad performance in the film.Steven Spielberg's legendary directing is superb, and we feel like we truly know the character's and have lived this amazing story right alongside them. The cinematography is lovely and cleverly sets up the humor of the scenes.The Terminal is definitely one of the best movie's of it's year.

With nothing to really add to the film , leaving just him . His accent was out of control. If I didn't know better I would have really thought this guy was from krukoshia. He blew me away. I think, course idk? That very few could have pulled that off so meticulously. I don't know if this film got anything? I don't think so though? But if he didn't deserve a best actor award, then I have really bad taste. Great picture. Kudos!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Tom Hanks Shines in the movie,"I was absolutely captivated by Tom Hanks' performance in ""The Terminal""! His portrayal of Viktor Navorski was nothing short of phenomenal.

"Pretty nice, well-meaning movie","Steven Spielberg comes off a bunch of science-fiction yarns to this romantic comedy. Acceptance is the key to this light-hearted, simple-minded film. There are countless flaws in the storytelling like what is Hanks' country, which is never mentioned. The movie itself is like a puff of cool air on a hot summer day, nice but forgettable. Yet Spielberg seems to understand that this is just fluff entertainment and unlike countless movies like this it does not take itself too seriously. That ease in storytelling and makes this piece of fluffy romantic comedy an enjoyable affair that you cannot help but get swept up in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of Spielberg's and Hanks' finest hours,"Review of THE TERMINALby STEVEN BAILEYIf Charlie Chaplin was still alive and creating, it's easy to imaginehim making a light comedy as richly satisfying as ""The Terminal.""Just as Chaplin used to take a prop and wring every possible gagout of it, Steven Spielberg's prop is a New York airport terminalfrom which he extracts every story possibility. And Spielberg'sChaplin is Tom Hanks, who takes a potentially show-offy, MerylStreep-type role and turns it into a movie character for the ages.= Hanks' role is Viktor Navorski, a European immigrant whobecomes a modern-day ""man without a country"" when his nativeland gets embroiled in a revolution. Viktor can't return homebecause his country is under siege, and he can't legally enter NewYork until his country's new leadership is recognized by the U.S.So Viktor has no choice but to live in the terminal--much to theconsternation of Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), whose chances ofbecoming the terminal's top dog are jeopardized by Viktor'sconstantly being under foot.= The movie's premise is laid out pretty flatly in the first ten minutes,which begins to sink one's hopes. But it's as though Spielbergwants to get the mandatory stuff out of the way quickly so he canexplore all of the possibilities in his huge playtoy. And he spinsViktor through every facet of the terminal like a colorful top,involving the terminal's quirky workers in his meager existence.= In that sense, ""The Terminal"" is a lot like ""Being There"" (1979),where Peter Sellers played an illiterate simpleton on whompoliticians projected their needs and desires. But Hanks is farfrom a blank slate. His body language, physical comedy, anddeceptively simple dialogue speak volumes. Chaplin regrettedhaving to give up silent movies because he felt that his ""LittleTramp"" could not express himself uniquely with sound. I thinksomething like ""The Terminal"" would have been an effectivesolution.= That's not to belittle Hanks' winning co-stars, especially CatherineZeta-Jones as Viktor's potential love interest and Chi McBride asone of Viktor's many supporters. They all give Spielberg's work thesheen of a big, beautiful dream.=",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
CZJ's character wasn't needed,"Started out strong,but loses its way towards the middle.It certainly had potential but feels like it got toned down to conform to the stereotypical Hollywood formula.Rather than continuing to explore the highs & lows of a tourist trapped by red tape in an airport, we got this simplistic, forced & entirely unnecessary romance arc crop up half way through.Nothing against Catherine Zeta Jones, she can be a great actor... but in this movie her character was a superfluous distraction, had no chemistry with Hanks, and ultimately was a detriment to the story.I would've much rather seen the arcs of the excellent supporting characters be expanded upon.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Record May Have Been Set for Product Placement,"Steven Spielberg says he wants to lay off the heavy stuff for a while and do some comedies.  ""The Terminal"" is a terrific step in that direction with stars Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci turning in outstanding performances in a story that easily might have fallen semi-flat. (It's actually a drama/comedy by the way.)Hanks is Viktor Navaski who arrives at JFK (not really-it's a great mock-up) from his native Krakozhia only to find that his entry is barred because revolution has toppled the government, the U.S. has not recognized the new regime and the second-in-command of security for the international building, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) won't let him leave the place. Dixon has a potted view of immigration law on his side.  The virtually non-English-speaking Navaski needs to get to Manhattan for a reason only disclosed near the end of the movie.What follows is a wildly impossible tale of a guy who spends about nine months in the terminal, making friends, learning English, getting a paid-under-the-table construction job and enjoying a troublesome dalliance with Amelia, a beautiful but definitely mixed up flight attendant.  That's Catherine Zeta-Jones, radiant and captivating as ever.Navaski becomes friends, in a mutually dependent way, with an assortment of airport employees, each a lovable stereotype.  His relationship with Dixon becomes increasingly adversarial.  Dixon starts off as a typical bureaucrat whose underwear is two sizes too small but as time passes and he seeks promotion to top honcho, Navaski being viewed as a possible impediment to his advancement, a streak of pure meanness emerges. And Tucci is great as a truly little man in a job much too big for him.Much but, happily, not all of the plot is predictable.  There are a lot of good lines. And a couple of surprises at the end.What makes ""The Terminal"" work?  Very fine acting by the three main characters is one reason and the supporting cast is good too.  Hanks is amusing but also believable as a guy unfortuitously in the wrong place at the wrong time - at first.  The hint of a flowering relationship between Navaski and Amelia is, unusually for a story like this, quite adult.Special kudos go to Hanks's dialog coach.  The star's Krakozhian accent is flawless.John Williams won't garner an Oscar for this score but it's a nice one.This film approaches the Holy Grail for product display and screen marketing.  The terminal has all the shops one would find at a real aerodrome and no opportunity is wasted.  Every major chain - books, food, electronics, clothing, you name it - seems to be represented as is United Airlines (since there's no humor about crashes or hijackings they felt safe, I guess, having their logo everywhere including on flying machines).I thought before seeing ""The Terminal"" that it wind up being a ""6"" or possibly even a ""7"" but in fact it's a9/10.  Thanks Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Hanks, Mr. Tucci and Ms. Zeta-Jones for making two hours in a movie theater on a hot, humid day speed by rewardingly.Can't wait for the special features on the DVD release.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great Story,"The Terminal is an unlikely story of a traveler who is stranded in New York's JFK airport because his country's (a fictitious Eastern European nation) government has just been overthrown, and the immigration officials refuse to admit or deport him. He is stuck in the transit lounge, and must survive as best he can.The story has a familiar ring to it: the protagonist is stranded by unfortunate circumstances, but by his ingenuity, he survives and even prospers in the face of opposition. What's new is the setting - how Spielberg turns the modern international transit lounge (a comfortable place nowadays - shops, restaurants, amenities) into a cold forbidding place populated with strangers.Tom Hanks plays the role of a foreign visitor who has to rely on his wits at first, but in the end he prospers because his honest nature has won the trust and friendship of the airport workers. He even catches the eye of an air stewardess (Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is simply luminous!) while struggling with the bureaucrats running the airport who conspire to deny him his chance to get out.The film does require that the viewer suspends his sense of reality for a while - in one scene, Hank's character gets a job as a building worker in the airport after a painting a wall in a single night with such skill that he impresses the foreman. And he learns a new language by comparing the foreign language version of Fodor's travel guide to the English version.Happily, I must say that these imperfections do not detract from the spirit of the movie, and can heartily commend it to those who are looking for a well-scripted story with an excellent cast.

I wait!,"Steven Spielberg is without a doubt one of the greatest story tellers in cinematic history. His human touch in his films, the emotions which can be felt through his stories are so powerful that I can only love his movies.The Terminal is about waiting and being patient about things to come. It can be anything, love, guilt, freedom or even power but waiting is a key point in every life. Spielberg created a movie which makes you realize this simple life lesson without holding your hand too much or even trying to make the audience cry in a forced way. Viktor is probably the sweetest man alive and while his journey can be heart touching, it is still a down to earth representation of a human that wants to make someone happy with keeping a promise. I really liked that the ending is kept in a bitter sweet fashion, making the movie a sad but fulfilling journey.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Better Than You Remember...,"Look, the romance is bad & takes up too much time. Otherwise, I can't help but feel like our universal disdain for this breezy, inspirational dramedy upon initial release was largely because of its proximity to 9/11.

Sure, its charm often dips its toe into cheese, but Hanks is so winning, funny, & empathetic, it's hard to deny the film's core humanity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Spielburg can still make good movies; The Terminal one is sweet, innocent and humane.","What can I say? This was a wonderful movie. It's full of simplicity, sweetness and humanity.After Spielberg made us jump at Saving Private Ryan and Jurassic Park, and after he made us afraid to go into the water with Jaws, and after he made us cry with E.T. and Schindler's List, the famous director decides to settle down. It wasn't a bad choice.The Terminal is something you can just sit back, watch and enjoy. You don't have to rack your brain for answers to the twists. You won't have to cover your eyes and the gore, or worry about crying in front of your friends. All you have to do is watch.The Terminal is a simple movie, but in a good way. It doesn't use CGI and action scenes to cover up its simplicity, like some other movies. It knows that it is simple, and easy to understand, so it's easier to watch.The Terminal doesn't overdo anything at all! The jokes keep humane and sweet, without profanity, sexual references, stupidity or unnecessary buildup. It doesn't try to be the best film you've ever seen, but the result may be something close. It's creative. The storyline is new (while not exactly perfect) and the characters are fun. Tom Hanks uses his acting skills and creativity to play Viktor Navorski, who uses his creativity to survive in the airport. He meets people and he helps them with their lives, and eventually changes the airport a bit.The film is funny, but also romantic. Viktor falls in love with a struggling woman named Amelia. You have no choice but to smile at the sweetness.But, that's not all. The Terminal is touching, and you will feel passion and warmth in your heart when you watch. It may be a bit melancholy at first, when Viktor arrives at the airport, and is scared, but later becomes romantic. The ending is touching too. The happy ending will make you smile.I know I am mostly copying Roger Ebert, so I'll add in something original.The Terminal is also about how the man changes the airport. After the line ""You can learn something from him"" (Of course, it's talking about Viktor.) the film shows the impact of one man in one place. His sense of justice and good-heartedness changes the airport in a small way.Tom Hank's performance is Oscar-worthy. There haven't been many feel-good films since his famous ""Forrest Gump."" I don't really know how to describe the beauty of the film. It's just good. See it. You won't regret it.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Good, but could have been great","The names Spielberg and Hanks are nearly synonymous with quality films, and certainly when teamed together (Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me if You Can). I was a tad surprised a movie like The Terminal was being released in the summer  when I first saw the trailer about a month ago I assumed it was a fall release  but this film ought to do well no matter what the season.The set-up is simple: Hanks plays Viktor Navorsky, a simple man from one of the break- away Russian Republics whose country collapses while he's in mid-air. Once he arrives in JFK, they don't know what to do with him; they can't send him back, and they can't let him in. He's a man without a country, and customs boss Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) is a die-hard by-the-book kind of guy who is determined not to break any laws in his handling of Navorsky's case. Along the way a stewardess falls into Viktor's life (literally) in the form of the dazzling Catherine-Zeta-Jones.The premise is somewhat thin, so we must rely primarily on Hanks to carry the picture by himself, which he's already proven he can do (Castaway, et al), and here he does not disappoint. Hanks is charming as Navorsky, who is a simple man caught in a complicated puzzle with no idea how to get himself out. Viktor makes friends with various workers at the terminal, and his interactions with them are amusing; he helps bring one couple together, and he gets to know another fugitive from a foreign land. His semi-relationship with Amelia (Jones) is very well done and thankfully has a few twists in it to make it a little unpredictable.Spielberg also does a lot with a movie that, let's face it, only has a few different sets, even if one of them is a sprawling mall complex. Unlike Viktor, we never feel confined by the movie, but we begin to see the airport as a self-contained little world, much as Viktor does. He continually turns adversity into opportunity, which helps to explain why being confined does not bother him so much.But Viktor is a little too good. He's honest, hard-working, helpful, unassuming  he's everything we Americans like to think we are but rarely manage to be in reality. As is usual in a Spielberg film, Viktor's benevolent attitude toward people ends up coming back to him in spades, and he ends up being a sort of unofficial hero of the terminal. But Viktor never breaks down or has a moment of anger (which would be natural in such a case) and his optimism never fades, not even for a second. While it's a nice performance by Hanks, Viktor's just a little too good to be true.Stanley Tucci also does an excellent job, but like many authority figures in Spielberg films, he's a little two-dimensional. He alone grows increasingly personally annoyed with Viktor's successes, one after the other, and he constantly tries to thwart the man. Dixon is the opposite of Viktor, a man unaware that his own negative actions will come back on him; but that rings a little hollow in a situation where Viktor is such the everyman that people can't help but be drawn to him. Only someone inhuman could fail to respond to the perfect Viktor, and Dixon's increasing anger comes off as a bit petulant after a while.The film is certainly worth going to see; there are some very funny and touching moments in it, and one sub-plot's resolution pleased me greatly toward the end. Hanks gives a winning performance and both Tucci and Jones are able to match him, no easy feat. But the film's a shade too black and white to be an emotional powerhouse; even one scene of Viktor losing his temper, even if he were all alone, would have helped. The Terminal is an enjoyable film, certainly worth going to see, but honestly I expected something a little more complicated and a little less obvious given the magnitude of the talent involved.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very funny and enjoyable,"I enjoyed the movie very much. It was very funny, and the whole movie theater was filled with laughter. It also has some sweet moments as well as a few sad ones, which evens it out.Hanks did a very good job in his role with great acting, and Zeta-Jones made her character more realistic than many other actresses could. All of the smaller characters were also played very well especially the airport cleaner.A movie that is good for any age and a wide variety of different people. A very enjoyable show overall, probably one of my favorite shows so far this year. I recommend it for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Entertaining movie with mostly decent characters,"I do find this movie entertaining but Catherine Zeta Jones's character brings, what I think, an unnecessary downer to the movie.

Maybe I'm overthinking it but her character (or her storyline) could've much more in line with the light heartedness of the movie.What I love about this movie is how Victor Navorski works to survive and make the airport his home. A little far fetched but that's what movies are about. I know this is based on a true story but it definitely got the Hollywood treatment.

Hanks gives an Oscar level performance, Spielberg will undoubtedly be on this year's DGA ballot. This picture could shine come next year.

Castaway in an airport,"'Terminal, The' is another encounter between Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. This time, Mr Hanks plays a tourist from western Europe who has to stay inside the airport of New York because his country of origin falls in a cruel Civil War and the government fall under the Revolutionary forces. So, in good International Law Terms, Mr. Viktor Navorski (the parsonage played by Hanks) is a completely 'not wanted' visitor in USA. Many reviews said that this movie is a kind of protest against the American intolerance against other nations of the world after the grievous events of September 11. And that would be the great idea of Spielberg: to make a popular and blockbuster movie that goes against the course of the political moment in USA. Maybe it's true but the force of the message - in this particular case - is not so evident or strong to make 'Terminal, The' a political movie. In fact, the movie resembled sometimes a bit like some Frank Capra classics. A simple-minded story with a simple-minded character involved, against his will, in a difficult and pathetic situation. In this way, Spielberg made a routine movie, with a competent although not brilliant story.'Terminal, The' has a uneven narrative, with some good moments and some others not so compelling. The support cast gives great moments, especially the old janitor, he too a foreigner who came from India. But the love affair between Vicktor and Amelia, a beautiful steward (played without bright by Zeta-Jones) is far-fetched and just boring. Another problem is the character of Dixon, the Supervisor of the airport, played by Stanley Tucci. Although Tucci is a correct actor, his character is almost unreal in his insensibility and bureaucratic attitudes. 'Terminal, The' in my opinion is far from a masterpiece or even a movie that deserves a special attention. Tom Hanks, maybe the best American actor in activity, made the show like always. Now, he's a castaway imprisoned inside the walls of an international airport. But again he made us fly away with his rare talent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
you'll be able to take something away with you.,"Talk about a movie changing the way I look at things.I never thought a can of Planters peanuts could represent so much, and that pedestrian words like ""unacceptable"", ""delayed"", and ""waiting"" could hold as much meaning. I'd never think about referring to airport doors as an entrance to a city--as opposed to being, well, just an exit of an airport--or find a better justification for why foreigners or new immigrants in ""the promised land"" (welcome or not) could still be so attached to their home countries...even if (or maybe especially if) the latter is teeming with political and economic problems.And, of course, slipping on wet floors is always funny.Yeah, it IS highly unbelievable that a person could get stuck in an airport terminal for months, but I think that the feeling of being stuck in a certain time or place where Starbucks coffee and saltine crackers become a sort of staple food (figuratively, of course) is strangely familiar to most people. :)I've been trying to compare this movie to others I've seen, but it just won't work. It won't be right to compare it to that language barrier movie with all the being stupidly lost in translation, or that other I'm-Stuck-In-One-Place movie with Tom Hanks holding critical heart-to-heart discussions with a basketball. And, true, I suppose I've always enjoyed movies that could make me laugh (without being American Pie stupid)--but I have to admit that this is the one movie I've ever seen that bears its weight in humor and novelty as well as it encourages thought.Worth every penny paid, and I paid $32 for it (but that's another story).

"Endearing and wholesome - Tom Hanks as ""big huggable bear''","Stole ''big huggable bear"" from one of the other reviewers. It's Just the perfect description of Viktor's character. I have watched this movie probably five or six times. I enjoyed it a lot more when I was a child, maybe I have become cynical with age.The sentimentality in the scenes between Viktor and Amelia really feels slapped on without much purpose. We are already sympathetic to Viktor and their entire interaction felt needless. How could you not feel for Tom Hanks's character, everyone has been stuck at an airport at some point. Perhaps the writters should have kept the script closer to the main theme of the film - following bureaucratic rules while making the compassionate compromise when appropriate.The antagonist airport director allmost felt like a caricature. He brings his freaking lunch in a lunchbox, obeys the rulebook to the letter, even refuses to make an innocent lie to benefit himself. Anyway, I found him a bit bland and forgettable.As a person from Eastern Europe, I found Tom Hanks's accent absolutely hilarious. He even said a fell sentences in my native language.

Before Watching: The Terminal (2004),"""The Terminal"" (2004) is a well-rounded and entertaining movie about getting stranded on an airport (and a few things more). If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:The Terminal is as said above about a man who, thanks to peculiar circumstances, finds himself stuck in the JFK airport. Even though the premise doesn't wear an aura of joy and happiness, this movie still manages to create one, much thanks to Tom Hanks great acting and the ingenuity and character of his role. Some supporting side characters also contribute greatly to this, to in the end produce an original and captivating piece of lighthearted (and sometimes poignant) fun.The only major flaw that can be perceived lies within the antagonist, the stern and cold-hearted airport supervisor. A lot of decisions taken feels extremely unwarranted, and even though they are to some degree necessary to push the narrative forward, can ultimately feel very uncalled for or scripted. This doesn't detract enormously, but it still something that could be relevant for few. All in all, The Terminal is well-paced, entertaining and most definitely a charmingly watch.My personal grade: a simply great 7/10.

"A playful, warm-hearted film","In Steven Spielberg's The Terminal, Tom Hanks is Victor Navorski, a citizen of the fictional republic of Krakozhia who has come to New York on a personal mission only to learn that his country is in the middle of a revolution and that America is ""closed"" to him. Based on the story of an Iranian who remained at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris for twelve years, The Terminal is not a complex and demanding film, nor does it contain hard-edged social commentary but it has humanity, humor, and a great performance by Tom Hanks. He is ""everyman"", the little guy contending against the dehumanizing institutions of our modern world and Hanks' great screen presence makes him someone we can believe in and root for.Viktor is a man without a country and must remain in the international transit lounge until things are resolved in Krakozhia and his nationality and visa status can be sorted out by rule-bound Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), JFK's Security Chief. While at the airport, he surrounds himself with an extended family of airport employees who, while wary at first, become eager to help. These include Gupta (Kumar Pallana), an Indian janitor who is paranoid about being deported, Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna), a food coordinator who is in love with agent Torres (Zoe Saldana), a burly baggage worker (Chi Mcbride), and a flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) whom he falls in love with. It is to her alone that he reveals the mystery behind the strange can of Planters Peanuts he carries around with him. At first unable to cope with the language and his confusing surroundings, Viktor gradually gets things under control.He creates a private bedroom in an unused part of the building that is under construction and earns money by collecting quarters from luggage rack. After taking it upon himself to plaster and paint a wall, he is hired by a construction crew to work at the airport earning $19 per hour, a sum which keeps him well supplied with Burger-King Whoppers. Navorski, destined to remain at the airport for an extended period of time, learns to slow down, develop patience, and become aware of what is happening around him. Yes, The Terminal has flaws. It is too long, too neatly packaged, and, given the state of homeland security paranoia, its credibility is stretched pretty far. Yet at the end I felt better about the world than I have for quite a while. Consider me a sentimentalist but The Terminal is the kind of playful warm-hearted film that I can enjoy over and over again without feeling guilty about its lack of significance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Moose Hole - Review of The Terminal,"Remember a time when back in the mid-1970s when Steven Spielberg was a young inexperienced director out in the middle of the ocean with a broken down mechanical shark shooting a movie many had predicted wouldn't make a dime at the box office? Thirty years later Spielberg is laughing all the way to the bank while all his naysayers and critics grumble away in disgust and dismay. In that nearly three decade career as a director, producer and studio owner, Steven Spielberg has laid claim to some of the most celebrated feature films of all time including Close Encounter of the Third Kind, the Indiana Jones series, Schindler's List, Jurassic Park, and Saving Private Ryan. And if box office numbers have any say in anything it's that Spielberg hasn't slowed down just yet as both Minority Report and Catch Me If You Can, both of which were made within the same year, grossed a combined $300 million domestically. With no signs of slowing down any time soon, Spielberg is sticking less with features that once made the most business sense and more with projects that peck his interest the most, this time around with the concept of airplanes in The Terminal.The story for The Terminal is actually based on the true story of Merhan Karimi Nasseri who was banished from his home country of Iran in 1977 and traveled from one European city to the next seeking refugee status only to lose his briefcase in France forcing him to remain trapped in Charles de Gaulle airport where he remains there to this day. Upon arriving one morning into JFK International Airport in New York City, Viktor Navorski discovers that his homeland of Kakosia in Eastern European has become embroiled in a military coup led by rebel forces. Since the country of Kakosia no longer exists and a military embattlement has engulfed his homeland, Viktor is refused access to the United States since the government no longer recognizes his Kakosia passport or anything related to that country and will refuse to do anything with him until the war in his country is over. Until that time, Viktor Navorski can not pass the front doors onto American soil and must live within the terminal both day and night waiting for the war to end. In the meantime, Viktor befriends numerous airport personnel who request service from him to perform separate tasks in exchange for food, money, supplies, and anything else he might want while he waits for the doors to America to open. Within a nine month timespan, Viktor Navorski discovers friendship, romance, and the true realization of the American Dream without having to leave the confinement of the airport terminal building. The story for The Terminal plays much like another Tom Hanks film, Cast Away, only this time there's a lot more dialogue  too bad there isn't much substance behind those cleverly divulged words. Unfortunately the film suffers from its own unbelievable story line in that many of the scenarios that occur within the course of its two hour time length are so over the top that it is hard to take anything from them seriously. And despite having a relatively happy ending, most of the subplots that occur within the feature wrap up too neatly which, once again, derives a bit from the film's sense of believability and realism.As was said earlier, The Terminal plays like Cast Away in that Tom Hanks is the main focus of the film and that is all that truly matters when it comes to the bare bones approach for movie-goers but if you rely on more supplemental supporting characters to add to the entertainment value, you aren't going to find that here. Tom Hanks never fails to do wonders with the material that is given to him, even the rather bland and weak components presented with the character of Viktor Navorski. There are moments where you are suppose to feel sorry for this man but unfortunately he is played out so much like a running joke at times that it is hard to keep a straight face in some of the film's more serious moments. And what's worse is that that running joke becomes less humorous and more annoying as the feature goes on thus eliminating potential connection one might have with the character and the actions that occur with him on screen. One character that does not seem to work well at all is Amelia, played by Catherine-Zeta Jones, the female flight attendant Viktor falls in love with. There is a point within the film where the audience is meant to feel sorry for the character after she admits she is tired of waiting for the right man to come along in her life  then we remember she knowingly had a sexual relationship with a married man. How do you feel sorry for a person who blatantly trots around the world having promiscuous relationships openly with married men and cares only of herself and no one else? And her relationship with Viktor Navorski, in the end, becomes pointless as just when she seems 'destined' to be with him, she ends up going back to 'dating' the married man she had earlier in the film. That combined with the lost connection the audience has with the character of Viktor Navorski results in an ample void in the film's emotionally driven message.Overall, the arrival of The Terminal signals not a new surge in the creativity of director Steven Spielberg but rather it announces blatantly that the world famous director may have finally been brought back down to the level of mediocre filmmakers after spending so much time at the top. The film suffers severely from a rather predictable and emotionally confused script that wraps up nearly all its loose ends but leaves its audience scratching their heads wondering how the conclusion they received came about. The hard part is deciding what The Terminal actually is, a comedy or drama  there is enough evidence to support either side, and that is its problem. It's great that Spielberg introduces some well induced humor into the rather lifeless storyline but sadly he bunches too many gags into one time period leaving the audience confused when the direction of the film takes on a more serious tone. This is not to say that jokes that used in the film don't work well, they do, it's just that there are too many of them that they end up outbalancing the film's dramatic moments thus resulting in an uneven presentation. With both Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can and The Terminal coming off as less then impressive, especially compared to the superb work he's most known for, this should be a wake up call to the director to get his head out of the clouds (namely off the concept of airplanes) and back to the sci-fi and fantasy genres he works best with.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

A Light-Hearted Film!,"Inspired by the 17-year-stay of Mehran Karimi Nasseri in the Charles de Gaulle International Airport, Steven Spielberg's 'The Terminal' is a Light-Hearted, Entertaining Film with enough merits to earn itself a viewing. Also, 2-Time Academy-Award Winner Tom Hanks, pitches in a fantastic performance.'The Terminal' Synopsis: An eastern immigrant finds himself stranded in JFK airport, and must take up temporary residence there.'The Terminal' is an entertaining film. Sure, its not Great from any angle, but it has some true merits. Sacha Gervasi & Jeff Nathanson's Screenplay is smooth & light-hearted. Spielberg's Direction is quite okay. Cinematography by Janusz Kamiński is flawless. Editing is sharp. Music by the amazing John Williams, is up-to the mark.Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Tom Hanks pitches in a fantastic performance. He plays Viktor Navorski to the fullest. Catherine Zeta-Jones is excellent. Stanley Tucci plays the bad-guy, with superb confidence. Barry Shabaka Henley impresses.

"Textured and deep, life-like and worthy, but not a ""funny"" comedy as it had been advertised to be","""The Terminal"" was advertised as a comedy, but it wasn't at all funny--- It had texture, however,and some depth, and addressed some issues of human life that may be important. It is a worthy artistic piece, so overall it was a good movie nonetheless.One of the movie's qualities--- and both a strength and a weakness--- was the evident lack of single purpose, or, perhaps, obvious point. That is, it was unclear what the movie was actually about, and it was equally unclear what the movie was trying to say. Was it saying governments are mean? Borders are bad? Individual humans are mere victims at the whim of political and social powers? I sure couldn't tell what the movie folks thought about the issue, and that was a bit ""deflating"" as far as my emotional involvement went. That might also explain why some readers here, for example, criticize the movie for being over-long and/or boring.On the other hand, raising such issues, especially in today's security conscious borders, is important. And raising the issues and providing clear and strong answers would have been a disservice to the audience. Leaving the questions unanswered, and simply percolating along, and the audience free to make up their own minds--- or at least give the matter some serious thought--- was a rarity in movies today, and a welcome bit of respect for us from Steven Spielberg as the director.An example of the disjointed vibe some folks have mentioned--- What was Catherine Zeta Jones' character doing in this movie? What was her character's purpose, and place in the scheme of things? Dunno... and that was a bit disconcerting. On the other hand, isn't life frequently like that? Don't we often encounter diverse and dis-connected phenomena, and attach what purpose to those things as suits our own little world at any given time? I think so--- The other characters were equally non-seqeutious--- but also equally plausible in the world of the central character, played by Tom Hanks.Overall, then, I liked this movie well enough, even with a touch of disappointment after finding that it was wasn't, as it had been advertised, a funny comedy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Eastern European but acts autistic,"Hanks' character is a traveler from a wartorn country in Eastern Europe. In the film, he acts a little like a Bulgarian-speaking autist, and in some instances, like Mr. Bean.

A wonderful film,"My wife and I feel that this is a marvelous film with the potential to become a classic. Tom Hanks is, as always, superb with an outstanding supporting cast. He is certainly the premier cinema actor of these times. The script portrayed every type of character that we could possibly encounter in any situation dealing with bureaucracy. Besides the person Hanks played there are all of the prototypes which we seem to envision in our daily lives. My favorite was the chief of US Immigration at JFK. We have all encountered someone like him more than once. It a great story which was beautifully filmed, wonderfully produced and overall a winner. I would recommend 'The Terminal' to anyone.

A light film,"A good film , a sweet film, a light film on a very heavy and delicate subject regarding the human situation as it still is today. Tom Hanks is so great a talented actor, he is very flexible. Here he plays the role of Viktor Novorski who arrives at and is held at JFK airport for political reasons he cannot leave the airport now, he is not allowed to enter and visit New York, he cant go home either, he cannot even be sent to prison. He is a nowhere man. This film should make the ideal family movie. America thinks way to highly of itself. And I happen to hate bureaucracy more than anything else. The world belongs to God and not to men who are limited and create state frontiers and draw lines. Nature is chaotic and we attempt to put it in order and stumble. One must appreciate that they built an entire airport just to make this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A masterpiece work of creativity.,"**** out of ****While this may not be Steven Spielberg's best film, it's sure to be one of the best. Not only him, but Tom Hanks as usual are both magnificent. This movie is the true work of creativity, making it unique and so different from other theatrical releases. I enjoyed a lot watching this movie, and even my father who doesn't have habits at all to watch movies, had a seat and watched this to the very end.The Terminal is the story about Victor Navorski, a traveler from a foreign country who needs to get a plane to New York. I won't spoil what he wants to do there, this is something which is only explained at the last 30-40 minutes of the movie. But something goes wrong and because of that, Navorski unfortunately can't leave the airport and enter the big city. Neither can him get a plane back to his country. He manages to live in the airport by doing many things which, of course, are very creative and fun to watch. But the only problem is that they're unreal.The problem with this movie (which has been the only thing which made me not rate this movie with a 10 stars rating) is that at most times, it's very unreal. These are things you surely would put at the bottom of the list of things that are very likely to happen in real life. Sure this is a movie, a story, but sometimes it's almost so unreal, it almost makes us feel we're watching some sort of a fantasy in the present time.Well, there's not much to say about this movie, without spoiling some stuff, so I'll quit it here. All I have to say is that this is a great movie, with great performances (specially Tom Hanks'), a great direction and great scenarios. Catherine Zeta-Jones is also as great in this movie as she's beautiful. You won't regret watching this movie. Just don't expect to see situations of everyday's life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A very much needed schmaltzy excursion.,"When somebody says they're a visiting tourist upon arrival in an airport, is there ever really need for them to explain their itinerary to a complete stranger?As long as they don't have any bombs strapped on them or they're not gonna unleash a deadly virus or don't plan to do mass killings, smuggle drugs, commit unspeakable horrors etc. in the destination country, why bother stating their reasons for visiting? Unless they are a market research company trying to survey the traveler, people will gladly accommodate that. There are people who don't want to hold up the queue, and there are some things that cannot be explained in a short paragraph (including my simple APPROVAL for this film), and not to mention the variations in people's communication skills. As long those visitors are willing to return home, it's none of people's biscuits whatever they do there that's conforms to whatever in the tourist destination is acceptable and LEGAL. Or people could just easily lie and say they're going to whatever is that country's equivalent of a Disney World.Mr. Speilberg and Mr. Hanks in the early-noughties have reached the point in their careers where they have already acquired artistic gravitas. For Mr. Hanks, having escaped being typecast as a actor doing just light and screwball comedic roles, and Mr. Spielberg for breaking away from just being labeled as a giga-blockbuster sell-out film director (not that there is anything wrong with that). Given it is the time in history where the US has just been involved in a full-blown war in the Middle East, not to mention, post-9/11 era, for them to collab in a cutesy but sappy drama/comedy involving a creepy old-ish-man-child-ish (perhaps just naive) having the exuberance of 12-year-old discovering unfamilar things for him for the first time, the audience would still be beholden to their effort, a much-needed optimistic escapist fare.But as far as Mr. Hanks is concerned, I hope this is the last of such comedic roles for him (Unless he would find it an acting challenge to up the ante in the cringe-inducing comedic schtick department, I would definitely not go check that one if ever that should happen). His take on the bumbling erudite prof wannabe crook in Coen Bros' laugh-out-loud The Ladykillers remake is him having a more matured comedic persona, and the one I kind of enjoy and prefer.And for Mr. Spielberg, it's obvious that this film could have been passed over to a less-experienced director but chose to do it himself perhaps as contribution to his country during the trying times, a gift to his fans all over the world, a straightforward film with absurdist undertones. Even at the risk of sounding like a suck-up, I'd still say that even though the film is based on the experiences of a real-life character who got paid for the rights to use their story, the decision of opting not to use the guy's real name and chosing instead to use a fictitious version of the person facing the same sticky situation showed remarkable prudence on the part of filmmakers.The airport set used is in the film is just spectacular. Never been into one (yet), but that film kind of raised the bar to what people's expectations of what an airport should look like, I guess. Other actors involved in the film: Tucci, Zeta-Jones, and others were splendid and enjoyable to watch in quite a decent and wholesome sincere film.--B-flat--",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"An excellent movie, that gets kind of weird after awhile.","Some people are complaining that ""The Terminal"" was terrible because it didn't make an ounce of sense. It's true, the whole concept of ""logic"" has been done away with in this movie, but I don't think the basic idea to begin with is crap... the actual story that it's based on is almost more unrealistic than the movie (Marhan Nasseri was given the chance to leave the Charles de Gaulle airport several times, but he didn't want to).So, it starts out fine... Tom Hanks is a scared tourist lost in a huge airport, and he can't leave. It was fun to watch him learning how to live in the airport on his own, kind of like a modern Robinson Crusoe.At some point, though, the movie starts going in another direction, with Hanks befriending the staff, and becoming some sort of cult hero in the airport. This is the point when the movie goes completely bonkers, because things happen that have no rational explanation. In fact, the whole reason Hanks came to America to begin with turns out to be a little shaky. The whole last third of the movie was like a dream.But even with the psychotic storyline, all the actors give great performances, and that is what makes this an excellent movie. It is all about the characters; they hold the movie up from start to finish.I thought it was very entertaining. 7/10 stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

US vs. an underdeveloped country...,"Won't bore you with the details to the film because you can get them from the 478 other reviews.Some fun concepts to play with though while watching the movie, which I highly recommend:Delay - Viktor is""delayed"" at the international terminal in New York, by Frank Dixon, who is in charge of guarding security for the US Immigration department. Who is really delayed? Dixon, representing the US? He follows fear based laws and meanness/revenge rather than simple heart based human kindness and common sense. Viktor behaves as a well adjusted adult making the best of whatever situation he finds himself in. Dixon wants to ""control"" everything as a frightened child would. His development is delayed/ arrested.Another undercurrent is love/acceptance vs. fear and control: Dixon must control; must have the spy cameras; he needs his army of docile ""bull-dogs"" Viktor ""creates"" an army of loving friends/family just by being a kind soul willing to sacrifice himself for the good of another.Playing fair/honest/real vs. playing dirty and corrupt: Viktor was genuine and even offered kindness to Dixon. Frightened little boy Dixon did so many underhanded and dirty things just because he felt threatened. Fortunately it all backfired on him.Terrific and very subtle movie on so many levels.

Delightful,What a truly delightful film. I grew up with the two Toms being the major movie stars. Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise. The former stars in this movie and the fact that he has played such iconic roles as Forrest Gump completely left my mind when I saw him in this role. Hanks put in a very convincing performance. He captured the humanity of his character and sold us on the idea that he is Viktor Navorski. It is a shame this movie did not do better business. Perhaps it should have been released this time of year. All the supporting cast is wonderful. There is foundation to the characters and characters are used to drive the story.

Sorry. Another real turkey from Spielberg. Hanks at his dullest.,"I can't understand that many viewers find positives in this awful sludge. Stylistically degenerate (how many tinkling, sentimental piano background pieces can you stand?).

This is a dreadful illusion - Spielberg purporting to speak for an imagined America, as he likes to do, wishing that it has, after all, a heart of gold.

Terminal decline?,"'SPIELBERG-LITE': (Noun). Intelligence-insulting work produced by a great director choosing to rest on his laurels. See Always (1989), Hook (1991), The Lost World (1997) Minority Report (2002), and now The Terminal.Tom Hanks, reverting to the mush that made him famous, is Viktor Navorski, a New York-bound traveler. Armed only with luggage and a Big Apple tour-guide, he finds himself bereft of a homeland and trapped in JFK airport when war breaks out in Krakozia, the tiny eastern European state from which he hails. Officially, his nation now no longer exists and his passport is 'unacceptable'  he can't set foot on US soil and, until the conflict is ended, can't return home. He is now in the domain of Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci)  the airport's heartless head honcho who, while realizing that Navorski is now obliged to remain in the airport until the Krakozia situation changes, nevertheless embarks on a personal crusade to make life as difficult as possible for his airport's unwanted resident. Ho-hum.Well-meaning it may be, but that does not excuse what is perhaps the worst Spielberg film, period. Bereft of the enchantment and wonder that make even his most sentimental previous excesses watchable, Terminal labours ponderously towards significance from take-off, without ever getting near its destination.Hanks, while doing his best in his opening set-pieces to revive the spirit of Chaplin's tramp character, must still take his fair share of the blame  one can only assume that he has, by this stage in his career, an understanding of the difference between scripts that soar, jet-like, or sink like lead balloons, but, judging by the clunking 'romantic' dialogue that he and cabin attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) exchange, one wonders.And the reasons behind casting the Welsh-whinger will forever remain mysteriousZeta-Jones' personality is well suited to playing hard-nosed bitches á la Intolerable Cruelty and Chicago, but a love-lorn perpetual mistress? Please.Only Tucci emerges from this mess with any dignity  his character, though merely created to fill the narrative gap where a Spielberg villain would normally reside, is nevertheless witty and nasty enough to provide some much-needed zest. As for the rest, 'directorial artistic decline' doesn't even come close. One can only hope it's not terminal.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Delightful Spielberg comedy,"If there is one director who can lift simple entertainment up to a level most directors only dream of it is Steven Spielberg. The best examples are probably 'Jaws', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', 'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' and 'Minority Report', working with genres like horror, adventure and science-fiction that show events normally not seen in normal life. 'Catch Me If You Can' is a perfect example of a film about human lives that could go wrong in many places with a lesser director, but never does. 'The Terminal' has the same quality. Both films are based on true but unbelievable stories. A lot of films based on true stories go terribly wrong anyway, not with Spielberg.Tom Hanks, one of those actors with also the ability to make things better than they normally are, plays Viktor Navorski, a man from a fictional country arriving on JFK Airport. While he was in the air a coup was committed in his country and therefore the new government is not recognized and accepted by the US, therefore Viktor's country basically does not exist. That brings a little problem, his passport is not valid so he can not enter the US. Of course going back to a country that does not exist is quite impossible as well. Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the customs official, tells him to stay in the International Arrivals Lounge until he is beeped and told what to do. Dixon is hoping he will leave and try to enter the US anyway so it is no longer his problem, but good guy Viktor obeys.A solution to this problem is not easily found, apparently, so Viktor lives in the Lounge for a long time. In this time he befriends people, even starts loving a flight attendant named Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The Dixon character becomes the villain, sort of, although Spielberg makes him a real character with real grounds on which his actions are based on. Tucci finds the perfect note for this characters. There are some subplots, mainly to support Viktor's story, but they are handled with care. One of them in particular has to do with the guy who arranges the food for the planes, Enrique Cruz (Diego Luna). He loves the girl who rejects Viktor's request for entering the US every single day (played by Zoë Saldana) and makes a deal with Viktor. He gives Viktor food, Viktor contacts the girl and learns things about her. Of course these scenes are probably there to provide funny moments for Hanks, who plays his Viktor close to perfect, but the scenes never feel like that. They just play like they belong in this story and they happen to be funny.All the little stories are played the way they should. Even the Zeta-Jones plot, one that seems obvious in what direction it will go, is handled in such a perfect way you keep wondering what will happen. That Spielberg is a good director and Hanks a good actor is a given. Here they prove it once again in a delightful comedy that plays, another impressive fact, on a very large set that looks perfectly like an airport. Yes, really delightful with a lovable leading character and a lot of lovable supporting characters in a feel-good story for everyone to enjoy, which is occasionally very funny as well.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Surprisingly good...,"...although I should not have been surprised, Spielberg and Hanks, had greatness written all over it.

Anyway, I have now watched it and I liked it.I thought the first half of the film was absolutely fantastic, the humor, the acting, the character development - they were all good. I thought the second half of the film suffered a little from becoming a bit over emotional, the love story seemed out of sorts and the way the entire airport staff seemed to know every thing about everyone else was a bit far fetched, I worked in an airport for many years and knew virtually no-one from outside the people I worked with on a daily basis, but maybe that's just me!

He figured out the quarters,This is one of the funniest movie I watch of Spielberg.. I literally laughed so hard at every scene with Tom hanks in it from his conversation to his action. Tom Hank's played a very believable Eastern European Citizen with the accent etc I don't think the movie deserves so low in the rating..Quoted by The man itself I wanted to do a movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world.. I can proudly says you make me laugh maybe cry a bit and definitely feel good about the world after watching this movie..

Unique story told well.,"I just saw this movie in 2021 so I'm late to the show (pun intended). But, this is a great movie. Based on a true story (somewhat). This is a very heartfelt movie with some great performances in it. Stanley Tucci is one of the most underrated actors of all time. Tom Hanks on the other hand is one of the most recognized actors of all time (and rightfully so). I would recommend this to anyone and everyone to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Stuck in the airport with you.,"'The Terminal (2004)' stars Tom Hanks as a vaguely Eastern European guy from a fake Eastern European country (in an effort to prevent anything from hitting too close to home) who gets trapped in an airport terminal after his country is caught up in a coup, which leaves him both without permission to enter the USA and without a home to return to. As such, he lives his life inside the airport, meeting a variety of people as he does his best to earn enough money to sustain himself on a primarily Burger King diet and to maybe, just maybe find love. It's a sappy sort of story with hints of romantic comedy and an almost vignette-like structure. Hanks bumbles about, practically choking on his accent, as he works his way into the hearts and minds of the airport staff who, essentially, become his family. Along the way, he unwittingly makes an enemy of the airport's supervisor, seemingly for no other reason than because he's kind; the supervisor makes it his mission to force Hanks' character into breaking the law by trying to escape. It's a bit of an odd choice to include an almost comic-book antagonist, but Tucci makes the role his own and the rivalry works as a catalyst for most of the movie's plot points. The rest of the cast do what they can with what they're given, but it's really Hanks' show. In a way, he seems the same as he always does; the accent is the only thing that separates this character from most of his others. It's a bit weird to cast perhaps the all-American actor as an Eastern European guy, but he's affable enough. The flick lacks any real themes and it's also slightly inconsistent when it comes to tone. It's enjoyable enough, though, and has its legitimately sweet moments. It's third act doesn't quite know what to do with itself, but the overall experience is generally entertaining. It isn't something that's likely to stick with you, but it does what it sets out to rather well. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very Disappointing,"This is a film that more than challenged my ability to suspend disbelief while enjoying a light summer evening's entertainment.Watching Stanley Tucci, as Security Chief of a major American airport, persist in explaining rather complicated immigration problems to Tom Hanks, a would-be immigrant who spoke absolutely NO English, was really too much. And that was just the beginning.If I had not seen the credits you could not have persuaded me that Steven Spielberg was responsible for this. As for Tom Hanks, I prefer to believe he was only following orders.",1.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Breath Of Fresh Air,"I had my doubts when I went to see this movie. Come on I thought, how exciting could a flick that has the title ""The Terminal"" be? What could possibly happen inside that terminal in the space of two hours to pry the story from the hands of inescapable mediocrity.Well, I must admit I was wrong. Granted the premise of the plot is somewhat weak -- Viktor Novorski (Tom Hanks) ends up being stuck at an airport terminal for a few months while civil war rages in his native Krakozia (Bulgaria). That little detail aside, everything from the powerful story line, to the spectacular acting by the entire cast without the help of fancy special effects or eye-catching scenery, works together to create a monumental movie.There were so many powerful themes intertwined throughout the story. One of them is that any human being, no matter how normal, when put into a strange environment, would seem weird and out of their element.The other, is pretty groundbreaking -- that always following the rules is not necessarily the same as doing the right thing, or doing good.The strength and uniqueness of the movie comes from the fact that somehow Spielberg and Hanks manage to convey these powerful ideas [and many others] through the eyes of Viktor Novorski -- a man who barely speaks English.I rate the storyline a ""B+"", and award an ""A+"" to Acting, Direction and Visuals (there was no need to use special effects to make up for a weak story or acting). Overall, even though Ngorski didn't bag the babe, I still give the movie an ""A+"". The last time I saw anything in the same league was ""Good Will Hunting"".",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Heart warming and very entertaining,"The Terminal has a simple tale of a man stranded in a airport with a rare reason. He is not allowed to go back home and his passport does not allow him to enter America. He is left for hours, turning days and weeks. Tom Hanks delivers a Wonderful performance. Catherine Zeta Jones has a weird character, she looks Great. I remember when this movie came out in Cinemas, it wasn't that buzy. (I have worked in a cinema before). It is a very underrated movie and entertains big time. Steven Spielberg has given us great movies before, The Terminal is one of his greats. Tom Hanks has given superb performances in the past like Forrest Gump and Cast away. This is yet another delightful film of his, you can enjoy over again. It is a very intelligent comedy, which is hard to make. Overall, a Must See.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Tom Hanks is still a crummy actor but here he somehow pulled it off,"Honestly I hate Tom Hanks, I think he is probably the most over rated actor of this generation. I also think Steven Spielberg is a good technical director who often needs someone to tell him when a story has actually played out and not to add an unnecessary 15 minutes to it... But somehow this film resisted the fatal flaws of it's two creative heavyweights (Probably because of the script which was charming and didn't allow too much faffing about from Hanks or a (overly) sentimental ending to be wrung out by Spielberg.) Overall created a lovely little gem that I am sorry i resisted seeing for so long.The main reason it works is because it is such a simple premise told in a really simple way. It wasn't the best film I have ever seen, but a nice surprise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Spielberg Channels Capra,"I have never been much of a Spielberg fan.  His most popular and his most acclaimed films did not do much for me but his last 3 films, including The Terminal, has changed my mind.The Terminal might be Spielberg's most human film to date.  I thought it was very funny and the characters did not rely on cliches.  The style of this film harks back to the days when you could not always count on a Hollywood ending.  I think that is why so many people were disappointed.  If the film ended the way of most Hollywood films, then people would be complaining about how predictable it was.Also, many critics are complaining about excessive product placement.  The movie takes place in an airlines terminal.  The people who are doing the complaining are not giving suggestions on how not to have name brand products in this type of setting.  It would seem to be unavoidable.This film is funny and sentimental. So far, this is my favorite movie of the Summer!  9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"One of Spielberg's more lightweight projects, stays in place with style","Spielberg can make a great story out of anything with his packages of sounds, sights, and story lines that elevate his work above that of mortal filmmakers. That being said, it's interesting to see him working his magic here on a story so devoid of movement. By that, I mean that compared to Jaws, Raiders, of the Ark or Schindler's List or even a more lightweight contraption like Catch Me if you Can, this isn't a movie where a lot of things happen. This is a slower paced movie that's really about the characters and the nuance of the arena and what more fascinating arena is there than an airport? On that level, the movie is meticulously crafted and sells the setting.Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a man from a fictitious country who through a bureaucratic glitch is trapped in John F. Kennedy Airport. It's based on a real-life story about an Iranian man who flew to Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport as the Iranian revolution occurred and found that the country listed on his passport was no longer in existence when he landed, and interestingly enough the man is still there. Historical accuracy is not this film's priority and for that matter, neither is any kind of realistic portrayal about the way an airport is run. The film is, more than anything, an abstraction: it treats the airport as not just the place we've all been through, an intermediary point on a longer journey; but as a state of mind as well. Because of that, unanswered questions about why Navorski's friends don't ever seemingly go home at the end of the day or how flight attendant Emilia Warren (Zeta-Jones) can have so much free time for a full-fledged romance on her layovers don't really need answers.The movie surrounds its protagonist with a traditional nemesis in Stanley Tucci as by-the-book airport official Frank Dixon, a love interest (Zeta-Jones), and Chi McBride, Diego Luna and Kumar Pallana as various airport employees who serve as his entrouage. In some cases, particularly with Tucci's character whose actions are seemingly guided for no other reason other than to be the opposite of those of the protagonist, the film seems to be trying too hard to fit square pegs into round holes. In the end, however, the story ties together leaving you with a warm feeling that in this case is well-earned.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
You'll feel happy afterall,"The story is simple and easy to guess but this movie is filled with number of small happiness and make you recall of how important people around you are and that you cannot live alone. When you find the reason why he always carry the peanut cann and why he keeps staying at the airport, you absolutely cannot help encouraging Viktor!The acting was great and makes you laugh, smile, or weep throughout this movie. Especially the misunderstanding parts (Viktor is Krakozian and is not able to speak English.) is very funny: not only the way he talks but also how the other people try to have him understand his situation.The camera work is pretty good. It is very natural and makes you feel that you are a part of that movie sometimes - but it always show how each character in the movie feel. For example, the camera focuses on Viktor at a loss and move backward to show the whole people in the airport. This can make you sense how he felt segregated and helpless, even though there were so many people around him.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
How Could This Be This Good?,"I couldn't understand how a plot about a guy stuck in an airport terminal could be good. I had the same feeling about ""Cast Away"" and it turned out to be a good movie. The question was, ""Can Tom Hanks pull it off again?"". The answer is a resounding YES! It works because the characters are so compelling and the stories are so interesting. The plot has plenty of levity, too. It makes a nuanced statement about the absurdity of bureaucracy without going over the top. Mostly, though, it is about the adaptability and resilience of some people.I thought the writing and direction were exceptional. Cinematography was good as well, even though nearly all of the movie was shot indoors. I have one minor complaint. The antagonist in the movie started with some depth and progressed toward more of a two dimensional archetype. It wasn't enough to ruin the movie, though and wasn't to the degree that is could have been.This is a very good movie with exceptional work by the supporting cast. I highly recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Hanks delivers again,"Tom Hanks is awesome. Once again he shows why he is the best actor in Hollywood. He takes this role and completely sells it. I thought it was a very funny, charming, and heartwarming film. This is a perfect film for a date night. It has something for both the men and women. The comedy and lifestyle of Victor keeps the men there (not to mention Catherine Zeta-Jones) and the ""love"" story and plot keeps the women there. This was vaguely based off a true story about a guy in France I believe that did something similar. It's impressive to see the different ways Victor earns money and simply lives in the airport. I definitely would recommend this movie. Hopefully this will at least get Hanks nominated for an Oscar (even though I think he deserves to win).",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Kind of boring to be honest, but I like no violence","Kind of boring to be honest, but I like no violence. The terminal is movie about a man from Krakozhia (a country in east) who has to stay at JFK airport in New York, due to problems going in his own country and lacking command over English. What make's ""the terminal"" special is all the elements movie has got, and by element I mean all the stories it comprises of. The main story is of the man (Viktor Navorski) stranded at airport, who wins everybody's hearts. There's a story of an Indian man, who has been long working on airport, since murdering police official in India who thinks of Viktor as an agent. There's a story of a troubled couple, the women from which loves to read, for whom Viktor falls. There's another story of two young person's falling in love and getting married, all with help of Viktor. There's story of a person carrying medicine for his father not permitted to go any further because of airport rules and Viktor tricks the main authority by helping the man. Winning hearts of officials, finding way to gain money are others.The story revolves around Viktor who is there to fulfill his sentiments related to his Father. The movie is what I call lovely. In the end the purpose of Navorski is fulfilled. The best part about the movie I liked was the napoleon story that women conveys to Viktor and drug incident. The only disappointing part in the movie was Viktor not getting to have the women even after showing his exceptional skills, especially in constructing a beautiful architecture. That's the only reason it loses its full marks from me. It's a great movie to watch with entire family.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Might as well peel an onion,"Tom Hanks plays guileless eastern European character who defeats New York airport security through sheer charm.Projects a self-serving image of foreigners as hysterical naifs, whose emotional incontinence adorns them with a human warmth that calculating Americans ostensibly have lost.Spielberg pays a patronizing homage to the Slavic temperament by scoring some vaguely Slavic-themed music and by having Hanks utter a few lines in a charming but unintelligible gibberish dialect that's about as authentic as Taco Bell.Very sentimental in a highly manipulative way.

Hard to go wrong with Hanks and Spielberg!,"""Terminal"" starts off a little slow but picks up steam as Hank's character (Viktor) develops.I enjoyed watching Viktor as a traveler from a distant country grow as he learned the language and interacted with the employees of the airport. There is something admirable about the way he sees life. He isn't corrupted by America's insatiable greed.There were however a couple inconsistencies that made no sense. First, when Viktor helps the hispanic fellow meet the customs officer there needs to be a scene initiating a courtship prior to the marriage proposal. Second, the way Victor's flight was delayed at the end of the movie seemed unrealistic.I highly recommend ""The Terminal"". It's one of those movies that just makes you feel good and doesn't compromise your senses. Very little profanity (a few ""S"" words), no sex and no violence. Just maybe Hollywood is figuring out that you don't have to shock people to make a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Way More Than Expected- A must see for many people,"Loved this. I suggest watching it twice, as I caught way more the next day (yea, 3-day rentals!).While expecting just a quirky, sit-com-like film focused on the circumstances that might keep someone in an airport, there was way more going on. It has some great messages of self reliance and an incredible mirror showing the best and worst of human intention. There's enough humor and plot to keep this entertaining while a brilliant film sneaks past the viewer.This is the kind of film I find myself quoting and using as a frequent reference.

Good old fashioned film-making,"I watched this film for the second time last night, as I recently saw Spielberg's latest, War of the Worlds, and was in a Spielberg mood! What I like about the Terminal is that it, for me, has a lot of similarities to the old Billy Wilder films such as The Apartment and Irma La Douce, in that love/romance springs up in the most unlikely of places or situations. It is great to see modern filmmakers returning to the roots of film-making in this way! There are plenty of humorous elements in this, and the characters are interesting and the storytelling rich.

Boy oh boy, what a disappointment.That someone could be stranded in an airport and stay nine months, building a wall, sleeping in one of the waiting rooms night after night without being thrown out, that an airport manager could do the things that Tucci does in this film...well, I can't believe that anyone could buy the story of The Terminal.

So what if the authorities would have arrested Viktor and put him in jail at the outset? So what if this is the most unbelievable story ever?

"a good piece of humanist comedy, nothing more, nothing less","The Terminal is sort of like a a Frank Capra tale spun into 21st century America, with it a sort of divide between the naive innocence of ordinary men, and the cynicism of the outside world. It also is akin to E.T. as being about an outsider who comes into a strange situation, gets befriended, but in reality is really all on his own on his quest. There is a sweetness to the film that works well, even when all plausibility at times goes right out the window in return to try and make shamelessly entertaining product. Steven Spielberg here has a film that is meant, in a way, as THE film for airline movies, as it can be geared for kids and adults, though like airplanes its not always the best experience.Tom Hanks is genuine for a lot of the performance, and at least a little fascinating, as Viktor Navorski, a refugee from a country made up for the sake of the film (though, apparently, his accent is for real). He's stuck in the airport, not able to leave into New York City or back to war-torn home. So, he sticks around, he meets the janitor, he runs into a emotionally weary flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones, not the best she's done but cute enough), and gets to become familiar company around the huge terminal. It's a huge place, with adversiting that almost makes it like a insular Times Square. During this Viktor goes from befriending the workers, to befriending the attendant, which leads to some romantic interest- or maybe not. Who knows with Viktor's true intentions to stick around for his chance to get into New York City. The reason he ends up telling is, actually, one of the most touching moments in the film, maybe even in the better of Spielberg films.This isn't, however, overall anything great in the filmmaker's cannon. Maybe not a 'minor' work, but it's often with too much whimsey. Or maybe not; it is a film that is meant as a crowd-pleaser, or a heartwarmer, but at times isn't too sure how to balance between some of the believability the script needs at times (i.e. why is the focus sometimes squarely on Navorski, when its a security station meant to focus on everyone at the airport). The visual styling is impressive, with some cool camera sweeps and tracks in the immense set. But it doesn't add up to anything that marks it as a great film. It also doesn't hold up as well as Spielberg's other films on repeat viewings; on a first go-around it is sheerly entertainment, but once seen again certain scenes bring out some groans. It might be even more enlightening or fun for kids, as it is on that sort of E.T. level. And Hanks' performance, which only shows some dimension towards the last twenty minutes, is good enough, though could've been more.I guess in short I'm saying that the Terminal is reccomendable, especially as a 'date' movie of sorts, though I wouldn't say to start off with it as the first Spielberg ever. That being said, Kumar Palau (the janitor character, also a Wes Anderson regular), is the best thing about the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
A Great All Rounder Film,"I saw this film last night and I always enjoy Steven Spielberg films so I knew this wouldn't let me down. The storyline of the film based on the real life situation of a traveler stuck in an airport interested me and this film uses that idea and creates an easy going, light-hearted story. The were over a dozen occasions in the cinema where the whole audience was laughing out loud so it really has something for everybody, comedy for the guys, romance for the gals...There's even the old goodies vs baddies plot going on. Hanks, upon realising he can't leave the airport gradually establishes a routine, much to the disappointment of the head of immigration who wants him to escape and become someone else's problem. Hanks even ends up with a better paid job than the office as a building contractor!Gupta the cleaner at the airport was on many occasions the star of the show. Hanks does a great job at playing a foreigner and is quite believable. Maybe not an Oscar winner but a damn good film and worth watching!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Not as bad as everyone keeps saying...,"I had heard mixed things before watching this movie, and I was fully prepared to hate it despite my loyalty to Tom Hanks. I was thoroughly surprised, not just because of my low expectations, but because it's a rare thing to see a movie this tenderly crafted as well as acted.Tom Hanks' brilliance goes without saying. He obviously has mastered his character and it shines through every scene. An excellent counterpart to him is the devious Stanley Tucci who provides a surprisingly small amount of antagonism. Much of the film's conflict comes from other sources, such as the employees at the airport, Hanks' relationship with the stewardess (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones), or Hanks' simple techniques for surviving within the terminal.While it would have been very easy for the writers/filmmaker to become trite and boring, the film is masterfully shot and every scene feels important. Not only are the scenes visually beautiful, but there is an emotional resonance contained within them as well.In conclusion, there were a lot of different clichéd paths this film could have taken which easily could have ruined it. It didn't play up the touchy-feely aspects, it didn't overly pursue the love interest or make it become unrealistically pertanent towards the end, and it concluded the film with quiet satisfaction. Unfortunately, movie-goers are programmed to expect something big at the end of a film, and when something quiet and human concludes a film, it is looked at as boring and anti-climactic. This is anything but the case.Definitely worth renting and watching, at least once. If for nothing else than the expert cinematography and Hanks' performance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

But the movie was funny, it had humor & Drama, which is a perfect combination, so give it a shot.Tom Hanks, tremendous acting as always. He does the Russian accent pretty well, and i notice that he did his homework when it comes to learning Russia.So we got, Good acting and a funny movie (at some points sad). You think that would be enough? Unfortunately this movie is ruined at some points, some things that make you stop like it for a moment and then later on you love it.I was pretty confused and didn't know what to vote...it leaned towards to an 8 but there were to many points at the movie that i thought were pretty unnecessary and ridiculous.

Could rank as one of Tom Hanks' best.,"I just got back tonight from seeing a sneak preview of the movie tonight after receiving a free ticket. I'll admit going in it didn't seem to me that this movie could have a lot going for it, but hey, free movie. Was it going to be a sappy love story between Hanks and Zeta-Jones? I was praying it wouldn't be. This did end up being one of the stories within the movie but didn't take at all away from the other stories, his struggle for survival in the airport and his interactions with the airport's employees. In the end it had all the pieces to become a classic. A funny script that shows the goodness in people is propelled but great acting and amazing directing.

"THE TERMINAL  received message, loud and clear!","(Karthik Narayan) The word ""Terminal"" means a couple of things - terminal meaning an airport terminus or a station, and also meaning communication system  And all are powerfully and intellectually captured in this movie; A rather intriguing, pressing film about a guy who gets into nowhere, a position that he didn't get into, but owing to circumstances beyond his control, has to live in an airport terminal for God-knows-for-how-long! Based on a real life story, the movie shows how language can become a barrier and also how it can be overcome once you have the right attitude. Survival instincts of a man trapped in no-man's land are so sharply showcased in this motion picture.A beautiful picture painted of the adage  where there is a will, there is a way out, and there certainly was a ""way out"" for our hero Victor (talk about the perfect name for your hero- victor indeed)! The movie keeps you guessing; the elements of suspense, thrilling moments that one would associate with Steven Spielberg (the director) are there.The fictional country of Krakozhia is well represented by Tom Hanks and he delivers the Bulgarian language smoothly; not that most of us know Bulgarian, but it is hard for an English speaker to pretend he doesn't understand English  so in that context its great acting.Tom Hanks looks young and handsome, and interestingly even though this movie came in 2004, he looks younger than in 2002 (""Catch me if you can""). And after Castaway, most of his movies seem to portray him getting into all sorts of problems and his coming out of them.Catherine Zeta Jones is a confused American woman who can't choose for herself. She and Hanks has something going, or so it seems, but we gather that in the end, she can't make up her mind at all. Now, I am not for male chauvinism, but her role had major flaws in it. However, she does excite us all with her appearances now and then.The end was rather surprising  shocking may be the right word, with all the interest and chemistry generated by the lead woman (Catherine Zeta Jones), as Shakespeare would have aptly named it, much ado about nothing. Or a blown experiment, even. But that's the story, to like it or not like it  that's left to you.Rating  7.5/10 (for its suspense mainly).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Not as disappointing as ""Big Fish"", but still kind of a let-down.","""The Terminal"" is the second highly anticipated movie this year by a big name director that, halfway through, had me sighing in disappointment.The first was Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"", a movie so contrived and lifeless it made me wonder what happened to the wonder kind who gave us Edward Scissorhands and Beetlejuice.The Terminal wasn't AS bad, and, in fact, has some really great moments only a director like Spielberg and an actor like Tom Hanks could deliver. There's a sequence in the beginning where Navorski discovers his home country has fallen into warfare and disarray, and desperately, fearfully runs around the Terminal looking for television sets that broadcast some snippet of news he's unable to understand anyway. This is a heartbreaking scene and I noticed I was sobbing only 15 minutes into the movie. This was a glorious setup that had me expecting a truthful, emotional, and brilliant Spielbergian parable on the hardships of immigration and the response they get from the country to strive so hard to come to. Granted, Navorski wasn't an immigrant, he was just a tourist, the obvious story to be told was about East meets West.Instead, my blood started to chill and my shoulders sagged in my seat as the film fell victim to one cliché, forced Hollywood contrivance after another. Yes, Gupta the Janitor was funny but his dialogue was dismal (do you have an appointment? -not funny. a writers device trying to be ""eccentric"".)The relationship Navorski develops with the airport workers was comic and touching on some levels (Chi McBride was brilliant as always and it was nice to see Diego Luna in a non sleazy role for once.) But their characters lacked any sense of realism or depth. The romance between Diego and the Customs Official girl could have been really sweet and compelling had the devices used to move it along (like Diego's bribing Navorski and the whole ""he said/she said back and forth) not felt like the screenwriter was borrowing from the stock bin of Hollywood romances. There was no real sense of a crush or distant love from Luna's character and because of that, it lacked truth. And therefore, why should I bother caring?That's how I felt about a lot of the movie. Catherine Zeta-Jones' character was so self centered and despicable in her devotion to a man she KNOWS is going to hurt her that I rolled my eyes every time she came on screen. Yeah, I get it. She reads history books (writer's device) she rambles on about Napleon (writer's device) and she's so hectic and neurotic in her life that she asks strange foreigners she's never met if they'd like to have dinner (writer's device.) I love Catherine Zeta-Jones and I know she's an amazing actress but her character was a complete fabrication from start to finish. The one, ONE touching moment between her and Hanks comes when he explains to her what's in the Planters can and more so why he came to this country. The acting she does without saying any words was the only other moment in this film where I almost cried, and yet it falls short because neither the setup nor the payoff of the relationship between her and Navorski are fulfilling or honest in any way, shape, or form. (Although, to be fair, their ""date"" on the patio with Gupta juggling the hoops was sheer comic brilliance)The world of Independent Film has changed my view of movies so profoundly that it's hard, really hard, to watch a Hollywood movie now and not find myself giggling or sighing at the abundance of recycled clichés and untruthful characters. I understand that most of these big studio pictures are produced for one reason: to entertain the majority of the populous, most of whom don't see past the stereotypes and are easily amused, and let them leave the theater feeling good about life. And you know what, that's cool. Everyone deserves to have a good time at the movies. But when that ""good time"" is being helmed by one of the best of the best filmmakers the medium has ever seen, as I'll rightfully say Spielberg is, I expect a little, no, a LOT better than what one of your standard second tier Hollywood directors would churn out. Even when Spielberg is falling back on cliché (Jurassic Park, Minority Report, and, to some extent, Saving Private Ryan), he does it so deft fully and well that it becomes original and stands out as a great film. The Terminal was not so lucky.It has some great comic moments in the tradition of Buster Keaton, and it's worth watching for Hanks' and Tucci's performance as well as Janusz Kaminski's always awe-inspiring cinematography. But, in the end, you might sit there and wish the filmmakers had done better, if only because you know they can.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Pretend Flight Delays,"Terminal was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Although someone may not live in a not-in-use terminal, it shows what can happen in life. Viktor got smarter, and sadly, other people didn't like that. That is another thing-differences between me, you, and everybody. My favorite theme was probably how he lost everything, including his father, flew to NY, to finish what his father hadn't/ Love. That is another plot line. Also, how the flight attendent was included in the movie helped make is humouros, along with the serious points. And to be correct, I noticed that Viktor always never looked down in the move. For a newcomer, he wasn't scared of anything. To tell you the truth, this movie was really touching to everybody. Even if you don't believe in living in Terminals, it can happen, it really can.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Terminal,"I consider this another Tom Hanks classic, I once saw this on a list of about 50 something Tom Hanks film, right at the bottom, I mean what!

Everything about it was great. Tragically low IMDb score for some reason.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Entertaining even though unreal,"Another enjoyable Tom Hanks movie even though the plot is a typical fairy tale as is often the case in a Hanks' movie. Basically, Hanks, a foreigner, arrives at a New York airport but due to no fault of his own, his passport is revoked but because of a revolution in his home country he cannot be returned. He is not allowed into the US so he is confined to one terminal. One of things that makes this movie unreal is that Hanks can't speak or read English yet the Airport authorities never get an interpreter and talk to him only in English, which is fine for English speaking audiences and doesn't waste time doing translations in the movie but would never happen in real life. The story revolves around his life in the airport terminal and the suspense is whether or not he will ever get out of the terminal and if so, how.The subplot is his romance with an airline hostess, Catherine Zeta-Jones. Unfortunately, she adds nothing to the movie. Her acting was par for her which is sub-par and she doesn't really fit. While Zeta-Jones is not beautiful she is too glamorous for today's generally homely hostesses, And for an airport which is usually full of hostesses she is the only one that appears.But despite its flaws, the movie keeps moving and it is entertaining if one ignores its unrealities. The ending though is weird and not particularly satisfying.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
THE TERMINAL,THE TERMINAL has intelligent understanding of reason like with all the red tape.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Terminal Film Review,"Steven Spielberg's delicate comedy, The Terminal (2004) is a dramatic film that follows the story of Viktor Navorksi (Tom Hanks), an Eastern European tourist who lands at JFK airport and gets caught up in international politics.
When Viktor arrives at JFK in New York, a military coup d'état destroys his country and he finds himself caught up in international politics by being a ""crack"" in the system. Because of the coup, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), the director of customs and border patrol won't let him enter or exit the United States. During his temporary stay at JFK, he falls for a flight attendant Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who may have feelings for him too, but he can't leave. While not a comedy by default, the elegance of the script creates humanity to any humour - dark or poetic.
Navorski is unlike anyone Dixon has ever encountered -- a man who is exactly who he seems and claims to be. With no hidden motives, he trusts, sometimes to the effect of winding up in comical situations. The immigration service, and indeed the American legal system, has no way of dealing with him because Viktor does not do, or fail to do, any of the things the system is set up to prevent him from doing, or not doing. He has slipped through a perfect logical loophole.
Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks convey cinematic skill as Viktor runs from television set to television set, in an attempt to see what is happening in his homeland, Krakozhia. As Hanks builds up Viktor's understanding of the situation, Spielberg draws in the severe and stern oppression of . This is effective because earlier in the film when Dixon was explaining to Navorski why he enter or exit the United States, Viktor was clueless as to what was happening and this scene makes it so that Viktor understands what is happening to Krakozhia.
The main conflict in the film is simple and effective. Cynical critics who do not see the movie for its lightheartedness may suggest that it is much too simplistic for a Spielberg movie considering his previous films such as Catch Me if You Can and Saving Private Ryan. Viktor Navorski and Frank Dixon do not like each other. Viktor's despise for Dixon develops over time as he notices the things Dixon is doing to try and get rid of him. Dixon on the other hand has disliked Navorski since the offset. The reason quite. Dixon wants to get rid of Navorski Dixon says ""sometimes you land a small fish. You unhook him very carefully. You place him back in the water. You set him free so that someone else can have the pleasure of catching him"". Eloquent in its dialogue and in its purpose, Spielberg massages the idea of how actively the blind eye is turned considering the events around the world.
This is only further highlighted where Viktor, being in no man's land still expresses a love for his country. Dixon attempts to make Viktor an asylum seeker by asking Viktor to be scared of the coup in his home country. Viktor turns around and says ""I am not afraid of Krakozhia. I am a little afraid of this room"". The irony here is just a snippet of the wit that Spielberg consistently weaves into the movie as comedy and tension ebb and flow in a remarkably cold green world structure.
Steven Spielberg travelled around the world to find an actual airport that would let him film for the length of the production, but could not find one. The Terminal set was built in a massive hangar at the LA/Palmdale Regional Airport. It was all built for the movie. Everything down to the last detail. That is rather impressive and makes you really appreciate the movie a lot more. The hangar, part of the U.S. Air Force Plant 42 complex was used to build the Rockwell International B-1B bomber. The set was built to full earthquake construction codes and was based on the Düsseldorf International Airport.
I would recommend The Terminal to all those that do not understand what it means to come from a country where people are not recognised. Examples include those looking to cross the border from Mexico, refugees from Syria and Venezuela. It paints a picture of what someone in Viktor's position would go through. I would recommend this movie to those that do not understand the displacement crises due to war and climate change for them to develop empathy for people all around the world who go through something like this.
This film made me consider how society is ill-equipped for something that can most definitely happen. This is a situation where a country had a military coup d'état and due to it, the revolutionised nation suspends travelling privileges in and out of its country. This is something that most people do not think of. It is a green world situation where everything just goes wrong for Viktor because of the selfishness of Frank Dixon. The idea of a revolution/coup d'état in a country when someone is not in that country or in another country at the time of it is perfectly plausible.
The Terminal is filled with other characters Navorski gets to know, such as Amelia the flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who is having an affair with a married man and finds she can open her heart to this strange, simple man. And Gupta the janitor (Kumar Pallanatucci), who leaves the floor wet and watches as passengers ignore the little yellow warning pyramids and slip and fall. ""This is the only fun I have,"" he says. And a food services employ (Diego Luna), who is in love with an INS official (Zoe Saldana) and uses Navorski as his go-between.
The film was well casted, starring Tom Hanks, Stanley Tucci, Catherine Zeta-Jones. But Steven Spielberg's casting of Tom Hanks was perfect. Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are partners in crime when making movies like this. ""Catch me if you can"", ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Bridge of Spies"" were all movies done by both of them. All of which had above 90% in ratings. Needless to say that they both are remarkable at making movies.
While mostly well received, the movie does suffer from a diluting of the plot and muddled side stories. The side story of Enrique's love affair, while touching, is dispensable.
Furthermore, the resolution of the movie leaves many characters stuck in transit, not finding their own resolution. We do not know if Dixon did get promoted, nor the fate of Viktor's companions. The significance of jazz could have also been built in more sophisticatedly. Instead, when Viktor does meet the man he was looking for, the plot meanders out as opposed to leaving us wanting more.
While far less cuddly than expected, this unusual and elegant movie may fail to connect with some audiences, especially because the movie does not fit into the usual blockbuster hype that movie goers expect from Spielberg, but it proves that he is the most unpredictable director in Hollywood. No other director - actor combination understands empathy better than Spielberg and Hanks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Brings Me A Good Feeling!,"The Terminal is one of the better feel-good movies I have seen in recent years. After watching it, I just felt so good about life because of this movie. This is why I can admit that Steven Spielberg is one of my favorite directors. He doesn't always make Oscar-friendly movies, which is good because he can make great films that are made to entertain, not win accolades. This film is very charming, has several funny moments even if didn't try to have them, has fantastic acting, and it basically answers the question of what living in an airport would be like.Spielberg directs a film about a guy named Viktor Navorski who is traveling to New York, but is denied entry to America. He is not allowed to return home as well because his country is at war. So, that means he is forced to stay at JFK. While there, he learns English, makes some friends, has encounters with a by-the-book Director of Customs, and even finds love.The acting is very good. In recent years, we haven't much called Tom Hanks funny. But he returns to his comedic roots as Viktor and shows he can be funny without trying. He has such an impeccable taste when it comes to his timing. Catherine Zeta-Jones is solid as the flight attendant Viktor falls for. In every movie Stanley Tucci has been in, he manages to steal his scenes. That means he is excellent in this film.Overall, The Terminal is one of Spielberg's awesome feel-good movies. This movie is not meant to win awards, but it has an objective to please the audience and give them quality entertainment. This film can be schmaltzy at times, but in a very good way. The screenplay is very well-written and is often heart-touching. John Williams contributes another great score, though a little low-key. Another fine directorial effort by Spielberg. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Stuck like Chuck,"Can you imagine spending nine months or more stuck in an airport?  I can't stand even walking through them much less living there.  For Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) in The Terminal that is exactly what he has to do - live in an airport.Due to some international fiasco between his home country and the United States, he cannot be granted a VISA and allowed into the country.  They cannot return him home either due to a rebellion that is going on. Therefore, he is stuck in the limbo land of a catch 22.For something so simple as a story about a guy being stuck in an airport, Steven Spielberg delivers quite a great story.  How bad can a guy's luck get when he is forced to bathe in a public restroom?  Or when his bed is made of a bunch of seats?To make matters worse he falls in love with a flight attendant, Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta Jones) who seems destined to pick the wrong men in her life.  What occurs thereafter is serious of comedic misadventures of a man who tries to occupy himself in an airport as best he can while under the watch of a ruthless airport security overseer (Stanley Tucci).This movie is an upside-down love story, a tragedy, and above all else a comedy.  Aside from an unexpected ending, it delivers a nicely told tale of a simple man's delayed journey to America.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It was also neat that it was actually loosely based on a person in real life that has lived in an airport in France for a very long time now.

FORREST GUMP II:  A rich man's fantasy,"THE TERMINAL is something of a metaphor for Hollywood and how people in its top ranks view the rest of the world. Everyone fawns on the white movie stars (Tom Hanks and Catherine Zeta Jones, in this case) and the terminal's black, Latino and ethnic working people all serve their every need--not for pay, but out of the goodness of their hearts. It's like a Disney movie where all the animals of the forest stop behaving like animals and decide to join together to tend to the needs of Snow White for no other reason except that she's...the star! There's even a scene where all the workers in the terminal run from their work stations to flock around Hanks and shower gifts on him. Sure, Hanks' character distributes a little largesse now and then, in the form of a favor or two to a couple of the workers, but the quid greatly outbalances the quo. Hanks' character even crafts an elaborate work of art in the terminal--without any interference from airport or construction personnel. So Spielberg has transposed his ideal world (being taken care of and made comfortable without having to pay for the privilege; no front office interference in the creation of one's art; ""regular"" people helping him court the girl; no emotional lows--only artificially inflated highs; and everyone loving him) onto a supposedly real world setting.As a result, there is not a single believable human being to be found in this blatantly condescending racial fantasy. Which is too bad because there's at least one interesting character in Gupta, the senior citizen from India who mops the terminal floors, played by an engaging actor (Kumar Pallana) whose performance transcends his director's utter lack of interest in the actual behavior, motivations and nuances of real working people. And there's a very clever and inspired plot twist, revealed late in the film, which belonged in a different, better movie.However, if, on the other hand, you buy into our prevailing celebrity culture and you constantly crave false ""uplift"" in your entertainment, then THE TERMINAL is for you.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

It is a tribute to the craftsmanship involved in making this movie that Catherine Zeta-Jones has to take backseat, but her acting was delicately understated.There is no question that Tom Hanks is a fine actor, but he creates this character in such a believable way that the audience easily forgets that he is Tom Hanks, a face we all can recognize, and begins to see him as a foreign man. He gives us an intelligent and compassionate character that we can immediately sympathize with.In such a character-driven movie, the protagonist is almost as important as the antagonist, and Stanley Tucci in the role of Frank Dixon hardly slouches there. Though his motivation is clear from the beginning and he never strays from a normal human character, I found myself whispering curses at the screen whenever he showed up to make Victor's (Tom Hanks) life just a little more difficult.There are sweet moments, such as when the hard-nosed INS officer and the man who runs the food truck use Victor as a go-between in a blind love affair. There are heart-wrenching moments, like the very beginning when Victor sees news coverage all in English that tells of the war in his country and struggles to understand. All in all, a movie I would recommend to almost anyone able to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Light induced,"As crazy as it may sound this really is another movie with Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. America's lovebirds come together for this peculiar and amusing, even though a bit light, comedy about a man who's stuck in...you guessed it, the terminal. The premise sounded incredibly good, albeit I forgot to think it all out a bit: how COULD you do this both funny and intelligent? And, furthermore, how did this fit in Spielberg's schedule?Well, it seems it fit very well. Catherine Zeta, Tom and Steven got around for a few days of filming and put together this nearly satirical comedy. It was just what Spielberg liked: big actors, interesting script and a movie for the whole family. So he lowered his magic wand and made it into another Forrest Gump. The comparison is a bit rough, but you might see a glimpse of Forrest while watching and listening to Viktor Novorski: a naive, a bit clumsy, sincere and good-hearted guy who, due to his lack of certain language skills, leaves the impression of being a bit...behind. Unfortunately his traits fit the profile I was talking about.The first fifteen minutes is where I found the best scenes of the film, but do not fear, for scattered throughout the film you shalt find others. Ideologically speaking, I really couldn't add up the parts of this here production: the story of a homeless and unwanted man, the great human spirit within and the less than redeeming love story. It feels strange. The so called love story is the absolute low point: it's distant and shallow, something Mel Brooks might call ""love uninspired"" (talking of which, I ask myself how a guy who could barely speak English, was able to read books about Napoleon which were thousands of pages long). Catherine let me down, because I expected a bit more from her performance, but in the end it's so short that it doesn't even matter. The terrible guy in charge, senor Dixon (Stanley Tucci), is the pain in the buttocks, total opposite of hard working and high spirited Novorski whose sole purpose it is to annoy us.And what's the basis of the journey, you might ask. It definitely can't be something normal, can it? Well I fear that although it wants to be different, the whole story is short of genuine.The movie is weak. But! it is fun to watch and relaxing, feel good material. It might be a disappointment coming from Spielberg who, it struck me, gave a strong impression at times that a beam of light can take you from America to Honolulu and back, but it really depends on whether the croissant really does come from Romania or not. I'll have to check this out one happier day. In the meantime, where could one go with the speed of light? 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The terminal is a must see movie,"Tom Hanks stars as Victor Navorski who has just arrived in New York city from eastern europe, whilst in the air the government of his home country has perished in the wake of a rebelion. Victor's passport is now invalid leaving him unable to return home or enter America. Leaving him with no choice but to live in the airport's terminal unable to speak any English.The terminal from the start has a lot to live up to, being directed by the god like figure in the movies, Steven Spielberg, who over the past three decades has given us films such as Jaws, ET, Schindlers List, Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan. It also stars Tom Hanks, who in my opinion is one of the greatest actors of our time. Forest Gump, Cast Away, Saving Private Ryan and the Green Mile are films that really standout in my mind. With this mixture of talent you would be expecting something special and that is exactly what the terminal is, something special.From start to finish in the terminal you can not help but to be drawn to the character of Victor. Tom Hanks gives a standout performance that will touch the hearts of all viewers as he brings the character of Victor to life. Hanks is able to evoke so much humour and emotion from this character that it really makes the terminal a must see.It would be wrong to say that Hanks is solely responsible for making this film what it is. The support cast of Stanley Tucci's Immigration and security chief who can't do enough to try and get rid of victor, is excellent as always, in a role he seems to relish. also at hand are, Catherine Zeta-Jones, a stewardess who passes through the airport frequently, whilst passing through she meets Victor and then some what frequent encounters between the two begin to happen, gives an enjoyable performance. Kumar Pallana gives a very funny performance of a floor cleaner who loves to see unsuspecting travelers fall flat on their faces as the result of slippery floors.The terminal is a touching and very funny story that will keep you gripped on watching victor adjust and deal with his surroundings and his interaction with people that he meets. Victor manages to touch the lives of so many that he meets in the terminal that it keeps the story rolling along at a nice pace and at just over 2 hours doesn't make it seem too long. The set itself, Spielberg had a complete terminal built from scratch, is fantastic and makes you feel as though you are caught up there with the characters.This is a film that I feel is a MUST SEE, even if it is not the sort of film you'd go for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Humor and touching themes,"""The Terminal"" follows Viktor Navorski who arrives at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. However, before he can leave the airport, his country undergoes a coup, rendering his passport invalid. As a result, Viktor becomes stuck in the airport's international transit zone with no way to enter the United States or return home. Despite facing bureaucratic obstacles and cultural differences, Viktor's positive attitude and resilience touch the lives of those around him, making a profound impact on the airport community.Tom Hanks delivers a delightful and endearing performance as Viktor Navorski. His portrayal perfectly captures the character's optimism, determination, and unwavering kindness, making Viktor a lovable and relatable figure.The supporting cast, including Catherine Zeta-Jones and Stanley Tucci, deliver strong performances that add depth and humor to the film.""The Terminal"" explores themes of resilience, adaptability, human connection, and the universal desire for belonging.

It's adequate for entertainment's sake,"The film was okay. It took a long time to get started and kind of reminded me of the Zemeckis/Hanks collaboration, Cast Away. I don't think the film did a good enough job of suspending my disbelief because it took forever for me to get into the film and I wasn't trying to resist. A lot of story lines weren't very well kept together and most of the characters were a little hard to believe. So the writing wasn't very strong. On the other hand, the direction and the acting by Hanks was pretty strong (Hanks gets better the more he gets to speak English). I think it kept the film from becoming a waste of time. In the end, the film is cute, but disposable. You won't miss anything by not watching the film, but, like many Spielburg films, it's hard to hate. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Delightful, Heartwarming Entertainment","""The Terminal"" is one of those films that anyone could enjoy: it has lovable characters, funny, cordial dialogue, and exuberant music, and it is a wonderful piece of entertainment for what it's worth. Tom Hanks is once again outstanding, boasting an accent so convincing that you literally forget it is Tom Hanks! His character, an immigrant from Kreckozia (or whatever it's called)is about as whimsical and delightful as characters come: he is simple (not too abstract), credible (in his dealing with the predicament he finds himself in), and laudible (his emotions are real, his happiness is real, everything he does is completely genuine). This is such a fascinating, if lamentable story: a man becomes stranded in an airport due to the termination of his home country which nullifies his legal residence anywhere, who ventures throughout the terminal trying to lead a normal, busy existence, while making friends and occupying himself. And what an execution! This is funny, genial, and amusing entertainment, featuring practically every element to contrive a delightful, hearty story. My only major complaint is the romance between Hanks and Zeta-Jones, which becomes overwrought as well as redundant towards the end. Overall, an interesting, delightful, and heartwarming film that reminds us that the greatest of things can be discovered in the most unlikeliest of places: in this case, a wonderful film, set inside an airport! ***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Not Spielberg's standards...,"I watched the movie for two reasons.... Spielberg and Tom Hanks. Disappointed to say that it does not match Spielberg's standards. Spielberg tries to balance his portfolio by alternating scifi movies and realistic ones. This time I was expecting the likes of Saving Pvt Ryan, Schindlers List but I guess, the the plot itself was mellow so there was nothing much the director could have given value-addition. In one of the interviews Spielberg confessed that once that he had lost his creative ability since he has taken the helm of production affairs. I agree with him.Tom Hanks tries to live to the skin of Victor Navorski, a citizen of East European country Krakozia which faces internal coup the moment he lands at NYC Airport. Admirably Tom Hanks has delivered a splendid performance to the extent he seems convincing as he tries to learn and speak English. And more so... how he makes the Terminal a home, making friends, finding job and finding love!! As every story needs a fly in the ointment, we have the Airport Manager who plays spoil sport and apparently has no job except to be at the back of our main hero.A few interesting tracks and episodes in the Terminal about Tom Hanks playing cupid between two airport staff. The Indian Janitor evoked a few laughs.

Loved it!,"The Terminal (2004) is a movie directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Andrew Niccol and Sacha Gervasi. The movie is about Viktor Navorski (cast as Tom Hanks), a man from Bulgaria. He gets stuck at JFK International Airport in New York City because his country had a civil war and his passport is no longer valid.The cinematography in The Terminal reminds me of Scorsese's style, which I really like. The camera work is amazing and it has many great camera shots that have so much depth, e.g., medium close-ups, wide shots, full shots, making more dynamic scenes.The Terminal is an engaging story with a lot of character development. Tom Hanks (Viktor) and Stanley Tucci (Dixon) both give outstanding performances, expertly bringing their characters to life. Hanks, in particular, brings a remarkable depth to the role, successfully balancing comedic and emotional elements. A notable mention is the character of Dixon, portrayed as someone who knows everything about.I found the movie's storytelling particularly very rich and impressive. This made the movie really stand out and it is a big advantage for the movie. The script is filled with lots of humor, witty dialogues, clever puns, making the experience both intellectually stimulating and entertaining to have a great laugh.I didn't have many criticisms of The Terminal, but I was upset by the twist in the movie that changed how I saw the main character's goals and the end of his journey. It made me think differently about what the movie was trying to say.In summary, The Terminal by Steven Spielberg is a cinematic gem with its superb character development, engaging story, and outstanding cinematography.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Squirminal,"This is clearly one of the worst movies you will ever have the misfortune to see that stars a masterful actor (Tom Hanks) and was turned out by a respected and fantastically successful director (Steven Spielberg).Here the ridiculous premise is populated with the usual suspects: government officials that are either evil, incompetent, or both; workers who are just too stupid to be believed; spoiled and uncaring Americans. The only exception is the pretty immigration clerk (someone Saltana), whose pretty brightness shines through Spielberg's attempt to make her a mindless bureaucrat. The Indian janitor is just annoying in his stupid suspiciousness, and his luggage and food handling buddies make Cro-Magnons seem like geniuses.No, not a single character to like or identify with. Even Hanks, at his skillful best, cannot breath any sympathy into the character of the moronic Navorsky.Why, when the Feds find Navorsky cannot understand English do they communicate with him exclusively in that language? Why are they trying to starve him into breaking the law? Why was Catherine Zeta-Jones even in the picture? Why is every person walking through the airport so uniformly ignorant? Does Spielberg really think so poorly of his fellow Americans? After the first five minutes, I was looking at my watch and wondering if the movie was ever going to end.

Amazing,"A charming throwback to the Frank Capra era of filmmaking. Tom Hanks plays an eastern European come to visit New York only to find himself detained at the airport's international terminal as his country's government is toppled by civil war and he has lost his citizenship. He lives in the terminal, and finds various ways to feed himself. He speaks some English and eventually learns more by studying magazines and watching television. He also makes friends with various airport characters, including a janitor and a stewardess. The plot is based on a true incident that I suspect was much less charming and endearing in real life. The script is pure, delicious fantasy. Hanks is brilliant and thoroughly believable as the baffled but resourceful immigrant while Stanley Tucci as the airport's security chief does wonders with what could easily have been a one-dimensional role. Director Spielberg no doubt played a role in keeping everything on track. Highly recommended, especially to those who loved the not-dissimilar ""Moscow on the Hudson"" with Robin Williams. By the way, the sets are absolutely amazing.

Spielberg's Best Film in Years,"All of the ingredients in this one (Spielberg, Hanks, Zeta-Jones and a strong supporting cast) are a recipe for success. And the film delivers. Though many people feel that Spielberg and Hanks' heyday have been over for years, this film proves that they have still got it. I think the most impressive thing about it is that you lose sight of the fact that Hanks (cast totally against type as an Eastern European would-be immigrant) is playing the main character. He does such a good job of immersing himself into Viktor Navorsky that the actor is incidental to the character. Major props to Hanks for the performance, with a near-perfect accent and mannerism.

America is closed.,"When I first saw the theatrical trailer for The Terminal recently, I was initially worried about the fact that Tom Hanks takes on such a heavy accent, since his character is from Krakozia (sp?) and speaks only a few words of English. This is not, in my opinion, necessarily one of the hardest things for an actor to accomplish (because I think a lot of the road to success is paved by the audience's ability to believe an actor with a new accent), but rather one of the hardest things for an audience to accept. A well known actor taking on a different accent or, in this case, a completely different nationality and language, tends to call attention to the man or woman on screen talking so differently from how we are used to hearing them. Tom Hanks, nevertheless, pulls it off flawlessly, once again demonstrating the sheer vastness of his screen presence and acting skill.Spielberg once again delivers an immensely moving story about a man trying to get home, a theme that he clearly loves, since just about every movie he's ever made boils down to that theme. The reverberations and reflections of the things that are going on in the world today are impossible to miss, which is why it shocked me to read one reviewer on the IMDb refer to The Terminal as a light-hearted romp. Yes, it's a lot of fun, it's amusing, endearing and charming, but it's also extremely powerful in a very serious way. It features the second most direct and blatant impersonation of government officials working in America today, second only to the replica of Dick Cheney in The Day After Tomorrow. Stanley Tucci plays the part of an customs and immigration official, whose charge to look after national security matters at a major airport disquietingly echoes much of what is going on in America today. The little American flag that he always wears on his lapel is far too similar, in size, shape, and location, to the one that George W. Bush always wears to possibly be a coincidence.The story is remarkably simple. Tom Hanks plays the part of Viktor Navorski, a man who has traveled to New York for reasons that are revealed near the end of the movie, and while he is on the plane to New York, his country falls into a military coup and basically ceases to exist, leaving Viktor without a country and without a valid passport, and thus nowhere to go but the terminal. He can't set foot in America and he can't go back to his country until it establishes a government recognized by America. He is a perfectly innocent illegal alien who has fallen through a loophole in what is meant to be the most sophisticated national security system in the world. And since I live here, I like to think that it really is.The movie walks a very fine line between sadness and comedy, since Viktor's hardships tug the heartstrings so much but the movie itself is so funny, and these two emotions are woven together to create an unusually strong bond with the character who, like Chuck Noland in Cast Away, is basically stuck on a deserted island and left to his own resources to survive. Chuck Noland had to literally live off the land for years, Viktor Navorski now has to survive in an isolated location, surrounded by capitalism, indifferent Americans in a hurry to catch their flight or get home, and a bureaucracy that increasingly wishes he would just disappear.As Viktor proves to be capable of following the rules that were laid out for him (and in a language that he could hardly understand), Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) grows increasingly impatient, which leads to the most biting criticism that the movie makes of the way the American government handles the maintenance of national security at our airports and, presumably, beyond. Viktor is stuck in a terrible situation, and Dixon does little to make it easy on him. He explains to him that he can't leave the airport until further notice, and then forgets about him until it turns out that he is doing exactly what he is told. Here you have a national security officer who is faced with a timid and exceedingly polite foreigner who he can't allow to step onto American soil, and because he is obeying all the rules set out for him, Dixon doesn't have a clue in the moon what to do.From this point on, Dixon does everything from explaining to Viktor that for a specific five minutes, a specific door into America will be left completely unguarded and available for easy escape to planning to basically pass him on someone else. Release him, but just enough so that someone else will catch him and then he'll be someone else's problem. Dixon can't arrest him unless he breaks some law, and Viktor is apparently entirely unwilling to break any law, even to pass into America unlawfully when the man in charge of the airport's security has instructed him to do so.While living in the terminal, Viktor sets up his own little living space in an area of the airport that is under construction, and he gradually becomes known throughout the airport. There is a particular scene involving a Russian man who needs to take medicine to his dying father, but Dixon insists that the prescription drugs must remain in America until the proper red tape can be processed, and Viktor diffuses the situation in a tense scene which makes him a hero throughout the entire airport. How everyone heard about it I'm not entirely sure.There are also numerous smaller stories that take place as a result of Viktor being stuck in the airport. Catherine Zeta-Jones passes through the movie on a wispy strand of a plot involving a flight attendant who is having an emotionally destructive relationship with a married man, and as she and Viktor grow closer and closer together, although not quite close enough for a whole date, she goes back to the married man that has been causing her all kinds of pain, disappearing into his arms and out of the movie. There is a charming Indian janitor named Gupta, who is unable to go back to his country for reasons that are slightly hinted at by the extent of the pleasure he gets from seeing people take nasty spills from walking across his wet floors. Then there is a food services employee who befriends Viktor in hopes that he can help him to win the heart of one of the women working at the immigration office, which seems to be the story put in to balance out the ones involving Catherine Zeta-Jones and Gupta, who suffers a rather unfortunate fate that is never shown.The Terminal is a simple story that moves along quickly and efficiently because the script and Hanks' acting make us care so much about the character of Viktor Navorski that we really want to see how his story pans out, we really want everything to work out for him, even if some laws have to be broken along the way. Spielberg has been accused of being sappy many times, and if he is guilty of it in this movie, it is because of things like the portion of the movie that explains why Navorski was in America in the first place, but only because something that moving is not necessary in order for the audience to care enough about Viktor for the movie to be effective.Viktor had us at `Krakozia!'",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Just because you're watching a film doesn't mean you like looking at it. You're sort of just watching what is happening. Who knows if you actually like what you're seeing? It's like if you're seeing Saw. Yes, you're watching it, but do you like to look deeply into the eyes of victims who have been gutted and left for dead? The Terminal is a lot brighter and more vivid than most dramas I have seen, and it's a beautiful film all around. It's food for your eyes and your thoughts.I'm not sure another actor could've played the character of Viktor Navorski better. Tom Hanks has been working in film for about thirty years now, and has ejected his charisma into almost every character he has played. As an actor, Hanks is fantastic. As a character actor, Hanks is excellent.In The Terminal, he is Viktor Navorski, who travels from the fictional country of Krakozhia to the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. Navorski's native country is in ruins with a recent revolution taking place, and all planes in and out of the country have just been halted. His passport and credit cards are no longer valid either, meaning he can't enter the United States. He has slipped through a rare, unexpected crack that basically states he can't go forward or backwards. He has can't pass ""Go"" or collect $200.His home base is the airport, a large and, literally, foreign world to Viktor, who can't speak English fluently. He spends most of his time desperately seeking money by returning luggage carts for a quarter a piece so he can have his next meal, eating saltine crackers and ketchup, and sleeping restlessly on rows of chairs. I'd like to call The Terminal a comedy, but the film is so sad in some parts it earns the title of ""a drama."" CBP Head Frank Dixon (Tucci) questions Navorski's strange behavior and his unhinged abiding of the rules. He doesn't resist, yell, scream, or get flustered. He just abides. Dixon wants Navorski out of his care, and tries to force him out the doors of the airport. Much to his dismay, Navorski chooses to follow the rules and stay put until the light is green. There is something so very admirable about a character who can cope peacefully in a cryptic and stressful situation.It is much to my surprise that the entire airport is a man-made set in a hangar in Palmdale. It looks marvelous. According to director Steven Spielberg, everything functions as it would in real life, with real food and drinks in the designated outlets, real working stoves in the food court, bathrooms, escalators, etc.I love films set in a public area, which would explain my fondness for films like Career Opportunities, Clerks, and Mallrats. Why I'm so astonished at The Terminal's location is that the film doesn't feel low or shy on material where it has to resort to pictorial aspects as a means of humor and substance. Scenes from a Mall, a Woody Allen movie, was about a married couple working out their marital differences, in public, while walking around a mall. There were so many unnecessary elements like a cloyingly unfunny mime wandering around with them and the fact that Allen's character had to lug around a huge yellow surfboard for the majority of the film. Those elements felt like gratuitous and impetuous distractions. Not to mention, the film didn't need to be set in a mall area. This was a film about a couple working out their differences; why did they have to do it in public? The Terminal avoids redundancy by including various characters, and dodges caricatures and dramatic dead-ends by providing development and substance to each one it introduces. When we go to an airport, we don't care about the janitor, the security guards, the people in there, or the people flying the plane; we care about getting from there to our desired destination, on time, and in one piece. Spielberg has created a wonderful, whimsical, optimistic, yet sometimes poignant story focusing on a man's unfortunate experience in purgatory without turning it into a ridiculous epiphany or a laugh riot.Starring: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci, Barry Shabaka Henley, Kumar Pallana. Directed by: Steven Spielberg.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Did you know..?,"Did you know, that the main character actually speaks in Bulgarian?Yes, I myself was a bit surprised :) As far as I know, the country, Crakonia, or something like that, is not real, but Bulgaria is :)The pronunciation is quite understandable, excluding the part where he talks to the ""Russian guy"". I really loved the way ""our man"" saved the poor man's father, but I did not figure how the Russian understood the idea, may be he actually spoke a bit English and understood the story of ""our man"".Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie.

Looks like it made in the real airport.This movie maybe one of the best of 2004.

...and than I understood I was wrong,"After 15 minutes I thought: I can't believe that Tom (Hanks) and Steven (Spilberg) have done something like that.

I had the sensation that a brilliant idea regarding the location for a whole movie (a terminal in the JFK airport) was up to finish in the most boring event in the history of the cinema. And than I understood I was wrong. As usual, Steven was able to bring the movie at an emotional level and ""poesia"" came out of the images. In this, he was helped very well by a Tom Hanks able to avoid the risk to make a caricature of an eastern man in a grotesque situation.

Liked it...for the most part.,"Enjoy this combination of Castaway and Catch Me If You Can. It's a nice story, and sometimes we go to movies to escape reality, right?. If you're looking for reality, don't expect it here. Of course, no man is going to live in an airport terminal for months, nor will one take it upon himself to renovate a public facility on his own. Who cares? The portrayal of the head TSA bureaucrat was worth the price of admission. Who hasn't met a paper pusher who thinks he owns the world? I loved it right up to the ending. That was a bit of a letdown. Anyone who accuses the plot of being predictable is wrong. No one could have predicted what was in the peanut can, and what he was in the USA to do. I could have used a little more subtance there. Overall, worth adding to your DVD library...",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Original idea + good plot = Great movie,"""The Terminal"" is an excellent movie: a great argument and an original idea combined together to bring us another success from Mr. Spielberg.It tells the story about Viktor (Tom Hanks), who's country suffers a coup while he is arriving to the US. For this reason, he has to stay at the airport, as he cannot get into the country. A great variety of situations happen to him while he lives in the airport: from really hilarious to really sad situations.The movie is great, not only for the plot but for the acting. Hanks shows once again how talented he is, interpreting the lost Viktor in the huge airport. Personally, I think there's nothing to say against this movie: just perfect. I couldn't move from my seat from the start to the end.So, if you're thinking of renting/buying a comedy based on an original idea, I recommend you go for ""The Terminal"". Be sure you won't regret yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
This is a good solid enjoyable movie.,"I was fortunate enough to attend the premier in Beverly Hills. Although the invited audience was predisposed to ""like"" this film, they reacted with great enjoyment.There was laughter and tears, and I believe identification with both the heroes of the movie (Viktor, Gupta, and Judge Thurman) as well as with the not so heroic (Amelia and Frank).John Williams music fits the scenes and moods perfectly, and while not on the same vein as Star Wars, provides the proper tone and background to heighten the films best parts.This is a good solid film with enough plot to allow for a good enjoyable 2 hours at the movies, and enough to take away to the water cooler on Monday.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Nice Concept, but Wears Out Its Welcome","This film does have appeal. I found it to be light-hearted fun along with another Spielberg film that had a similar tone (Catch Me if You Can). Of course, Hanks is masterful, Zeta-Jones is beautiful and Tucci is incredible in his role as a customs agent. I think most viewers will like or liked the cat and mouse banter between Hanks and Tucci's characters. It reminded me a little of how Forrest Gump kept beating the odds stacked against him.Unfortnately, half way through this film you begin to look at your watch. I kept thinking enough is enough. Please just get to the point. It is far too long for a film of this type and the payoff at the end did not justify the lengthiness of this film. I was hoping for an ending with more substance. It doesn't follow formula when it comes to the quasi-relationship between Zeta-Jones and Hanks which is refreshing, but at the end of the film I felt like saying, ""Okay, what was this whole exercise for?"" I give it a 5 because it lost me halfway through the film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

please READ before you think of seeing this garbage,"Don't be fooled by the very funny trailer for this movie, which promises two hours of enjoyable comedy. This film is not funny. It is a total waste of your time.Tom Hanks plays Viktor, a man from a fictional East European country, who finds himself stranded in the JFK international terminal when his passport and visa are declared invalid. It's not Viktor's fault -- there's been a coup in his country -- it's just a bizarre bureaucratic nightmare and he's stuck at JFK -- for months.Stanley Tucci plays the mean-spirited arrogant US Customs Official who's more interested in his own promotion than in showing a measure of kindness and compassion to Viktor.Viktor meets a guy who works for a catering service, and he's willing to give Viktor some food, but only if Viktor gets info on a cute girl the catering guy is in love with. The fact that Viktor has no money to buy food and has been treated appallingly by the US Customs Dept isn't reason enough for the catering guy to help. No, he'll only help if there's something in it for him. Ha ha ha ha --- oh my tummy hurts from all this hilarity.Viktor meets an Indian janitor who thinks it's hilarious to watch passengers slip on his freshly-mopped floors. Ha ha ha ha ha -- oh -- it's so funny -- NOT.Catherine Zeta Jones plays a flight attendant who is sooooooooooooo sad that her married lover wants to spend July 4th with his wife. Poor Catherine -- maybe she should stop screwing around with someone else's husband -- oh hah ah hah ha ha ha -- oh please make it stop, make it stop -- just MAKE IT STOP.So the movie drags on and on, like the war in Iraq, and every time Viktor finds a way to take care of himself -- like get a job in the terminal so he'll have money for toothpaste and clean underwear and things like that, the nasty US Customs official spitefully finds a way to take all that away.

Premise Is Not Believable / Very Aggravating,"I can't remember the last time I that a movie was so bad that I couldn't stand to watch the whole thing, now I'll remember.No matter how moronic and sadistic a bureaucracy may be, I just couldn't believe that in the JFK International Terminal that there would be so many people who could blatantly ignore the fact that this poor passenger could understand barely a word they were saying. And I happen to be a Kafka fan, so I've read a little bit about unchecked mindless bureaucracies, and when properly portrayed they're as funny as they are scary; The Terminal was neither.It seemed that the whole airport staff was totally ignorant. Several people kept talking to him in English, even acknowledging that they knew that he couldn't understand what they were saying. They also acknowledged that they needed an interpreter, and even though he was showing them his translation dictionary, and they acknowledged that he had a translation dictionary, no one tried to use it to help the situation.It might have been used as a joke if somebody had suggested that the Stanley Tucci character was an ignoramus, and had him demoted or if someone had filed a lawsuit, or otherwise pointed out the incompetence.But alas I couldn't wait that long. I don't know whether I'm proud or embarrassed that I was able to survive watching 30 min of this totally ridiculous / aggravating / silly waste of time of a movie.I can't believe that Tom Hanks did this movie; I can't believe that it ever got made at all.

Do you know what Napoleon gave to Josephine on her birthday?,"I can tell you what he didn't give her. He didn't give her a copy of The Terminal. You can just imagine the writers being delayed at JFK and coming up with this latest cockery.

Tom Hanks is stranded again this time in the world of bad cinema and becomes a ""crack"" in the system: he can neither go back to his Balkan home of ""crack""ozhia or enter American soil (except for moonlight dinners by the landing strip of course).Our hero becomes messenger for an employee who ends up marrying a customs agent who has never met him but will marry him for the ring (airport women are that shallow) and proceeds to make a fountain for his love interest from airport urinals. The painful moment came when Zeta Jones asks Viktor ""you're living at gate 67, I just wanna know why?"" you can almost see her read her cue cards. Ouch. Hank's physical performance is Gumpian and his Krackozhian accent gets a bit tedious but he is a remarkable physical actor.

Finding Home in the Transit Lounge,"The cinematic work The Terminal, directed by Steven Spielberg, is classified as a romantic comedy drama.The narrative of the film revolves around Viktor Navorski, a character from Krakozhia, who travels to New York City. A notable aspect of the film is the fact that Navorski is not proficient in English, which further complicates his attempts to navigate the city and its cultural nuances. A crisis has occurred in his country of origin, which has resulted in his inability to obtain a visa for America. Consequently, his passport has become invalid due to the crisis in his country of origin. An attempt is made by the passport authority officer to comprehend Navorski's situation, but he is unable to do so due to his lack of English proficiency. He is subsequently confined to the international transport lounge for an indeterminate period. It is subsequently revealed to him that his country is experiencing a crisis, which causes him great sadness. He thus began residing in the international transport lounge, where he consumed meals, slept, and bathed. He engaged with other individuals, exhibiting a distinct personality. His actions were a source of amusement, and he acquired English language skills through self-study using books. He established friendships with airport staff. The airport authority staffs suspected that he might be attempting to escape, but he was awaiting the processing of his visa. He facilitated a connection between a female airport official and a food staff member at the airport who harboured a secret romantic interest in her. Navorski encounters a young woman who works as a flight attendant. He subsequently develops a romantic interest in her and seeks employment to fund a dinner date with her. However, she is in a relationship with a married man, a fact Navorski becomes aware of. Navorski intervenes to help a man in possession of his father's medicines, which he wishes to retain. This act of kindness wins him the respect of the airport staffs, with the exception of the chief commissioner, who harbours an ego and creates difficulties for Navorski. The war in Krakozhia had come to an end, and Navorski's visit to New York was intended to obtain a message from his father's favourite jazz singer, a promise he had made to his father. His prolonged stay at the airport, in pursuit of this promise, caught the attention of many. However, the chief commissioner of the airport refused to allow him to travel to New York, instead requesting that he return to his country of origin. However, with the assistance of his colleagues and acquaintances, he was able to secure passage to New York and pay a visit to the renowned jazz singer.The narrative was engaging, the direction standard, and the performances well-received. The musical scores and comedy scenes were effective, although some scenes of the female protagonist were unsatisfactory. The film is valuable for repeated watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

She understood how clever Victor (Hank character) had become, once he was approached by the acting Airport Commissioner, and how he was even more empowered when he began to grasp the Englsih language. Another reason it was great is that we got to see the commitment Victor had to his dead father. How many of us wouldn't have bolted for the door.

They've done it again!,"The Magic of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks comes to life in ""The Terminal"" a seamlessly filmed story of Viktor Navorski, a man with ""no country, and No real identity (or so it seems)"". The story unfolds in a very lifelike replica of JFK or any one of today's airports across the country. Victor finds himself stranded in The Terminal after his country's government has been taken over by a violent coup.As time evolves, and Victor is not allowed to leave the terminal, he finds his way thru the day to day life of living in an airport terminal , and trying to make ends meet. He has no money, no way to contact anybody from his home country (try using a 10.00 prepaid phone card to call Krakozhia!)... Soon, to the chagrin of the security department at the airport, Victor is working, living and interacting with the the people who earn their living on the day today workings of the Terminal. This all sounds very commonplace as I describe this, but what is truly amazing is the story that is told just beneath the surface of this wonderful movie.This is partly a story of loyalty. Loyalty to good things, and to bad things, and what the consequences of them are. In the end, what is good, and true will come through no matter what the obstacles are. Truth prevails, patience wins, and a dream has a birth place...In, The Terminal.This is a wonderful movie full of laughter, humor, humility and some unabashedly shameful moments as we see people, mostly Americans at their best and worst. There are moments of tears, joy, and laughter. My husband and I saw this together, and the men of the audience truly enjoyed the movie as my husband did. This isn't just a ""chick flick"" it's a movie for anyone who has ever had a dream, or made a promise and vowed to see that thru no matter what.Enjoy Tom Hanks in another heart warming performance that will have you completely believing that Victor Navorski truly exists! Tom never lets us down! Saying that, I believe that Catherine-Zeta Jones was wasted in this movie..her role seemed superficial at best, and misplaced and out of sync with the entire pace of the movie at worst. She just doesn't seem to fit. I felt her performance lacked emotional impact in many ways..she just didn't seem to portray the character of someone struggling with the inner demons that are supposedly waging war within her heart and mind. I just didn't buy it....It could have been the writing for her script..something was just off with her character and performance. Fortunately, Tom Hanks can hold any scene and better yet, will anchor any scene all on his own, and will save the day as always, and in that fact, the impact of her performance doesn't cause as much of a problem as it would have if Tom had not been Viktor Navorski.Well, enough has been said, and I will leave you by saying that this movie is definitely worth the money that you spend to see it, and will be a great addition to your DVD collection when it comes out!!

This film is ''incredible''.,"The accent Tom Hanks gets away with in this 'film' will astound you.
It was only 15 years ago that something like this was possible.
Meerkats would struggle watching this level of tackiness.
Blind-drunk Borat impressionsm stops in its tracks.
There's however ways to enjoy this film:
Surround yourself with folks that love to comment loudly on everything and remember to drink wildly. You know the types.If you were Russia and you watched this, you would probably have to ask the US gov for an extradition of anyone involved in this project. Chained. Muted.''In a deleted scene, Navorski gets help using a phone card and says, ""Home phone, home phone!"" Steven Spielberg cut it because he didn't want comparisons to E. T. (1982) and the famous lines ""Phone home.""Which is because horse-antagonist-directing-Steve, is an actual auteur.
Most of Tom Hanks accent here would be out of place comming out of the mouth of a horse, but only barely. Because Tom is a good actorer, maybe even as good as that horse in that other classy film, the great Spielberg made later on.''As of July 2017, Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg have collaborated for 5 films. The Terminal is the only film in their collaboration which hadn't been nominated for Academy awards.''
This could be one of many reasons why that is:
''In the scene where Viktor and other people sing the Krakozhian national anthem, they sing the anthem of Albania in ""gibberish"" words.
Although Viktor comes from the fictional country of Krakozhia, the language he speaks in the movie is Bulgarian. The written material shown (the Fodor's guide and the magazine page with the jazz greats) is in bad Russian.''
Not unlike the accent which is bad russian aswell. The film is bad too.

Remembering that some things are worth waiting for helps us to decide what it is that is worth the wait, and to prize it truly when we do receive it.""And, yes, Viktor also teaches you to listen to those around you. Remember, all they want is someone to listen.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
One of the best films out there,"Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a traveler from a fictional nation of Krakozhia, that gets stuck in New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport for 9 months, as he discovers upon arrival that his passport is no longer valid and has to wait until his country gets out of the civil war.I loved this film for its great shots, the storyline of the airport which is normally a transitory space, but becomes ""home"" for Viktor. It shows a side of travel that you do not encounter as a usual traveler.I liked the acting and the comedy they bring to the stressful situation the main character finds himself in.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Happy 10-Year Anniversary!,"First off, I want to mention I love airports & airplanes! They're my favorite means of traveling.When I first saw this, I was 12 years old. I remember begging my Dad to watch the Incredibles again (even though it was gonna be in Japanese) but he insisted otherwise. So I went a long with it, seeing as how my Dad is a big Tom Hanks fan, just as I have become. ;) We watched this flick as a family and a whole bunch of friends - I remember it like it was yesterday.Boy, did everything work together & right in this flick. It had everything it needed to be a good film!First off, Tom Hank's foreign accent was very convincing - after all, he is a great actor! Stanley Tucci is great at playing the smart-alack-y & unlikable airport bully - liked him in ""Beethoven"" too. Catherine Zeta-Jones is excellent, as always, as the love interest; though actually I think she's prettier in the ""Zorro"" films.A lot of the supporting characters are quite colorful & memorable too. Need I mention the beautiful Zoe Saldana? When I was sitting there in the theater, I was just captivated by how pretty she looked; and 10 years hasn't changed that at all. ;)I enjoy the product placement as well; store after store. lol. John Williams' score is really memorable, beautiful, and uplifting too - I often listen to the main theme of the movie.I also give credit to this movie for introducing me to Benny Golson.So many scenes & lines in this movie still make me feel a range of emotions to this day.Some of the memorable lines include: ""Bite to eat."" ""I hate the Tuesday!"" ""Do you have an appointment?"" ""He chit."" ""So we 'Cher' the panties?"" ""I wait!"" ""You touch it again, I kill you."" ""Goat."" ""I am delayed... long time."" ""Get lost."" ""What time? Dinner time.""Amazingly, the entire ""terminal"" set was built inside of an old aircraft hanger! Kudos to Steven Spielberg for always proving to be amazing & creative.I think my favorite scenes in this film are when Viktor finds out about the Quarters, when Viktor starts ordering from Burger King, when Gupta tells his story about India, the end credits with all the autographs of the people who made the movie (that was very unique), and when Gupta manages to stop the airplane with his mop! (Seriously, the music in that scene was really gripping my heart - I thought Gupta was gonna get killed by the plane.)The only downside I've got with this film is the language - often times language takes me out of a film (whether it is 4-letter words or blasphemy). Plus, Tom Hanks' past is a little depressing, regarding how he wrote a beautiful letter at 16 years-old of how much he loved the Lord, and wanted to serve Him with his life; then he went off to college, studied false philosophy (i.e. Darwinian evolution) & likely destroyed his faith; as of now, he stars in movies with little or no morals. I'm just saying I feel sorry for him in that area.But overall, people can enjoy this film! Great time, no alcohol required, and worth buying on Blu-Ray.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Magical intimacy,"Tom Hanks masters a European accent in this gem of a film that brings people together from different cultures who have one thing in common...preserving their humanity. Hanks plays the citizen of a country flattened in a brief war and he is now man without a country, a displaced person and is not allowed to leave customs at JFK airport and must stay in the terminal while bureaucracy plays itself out supervised by a self serving government official with political aspirations (Stanley Tucci). Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the apple of Hanks' eye as a flight attendant and Steven Spielberg's ability to keep himself grounded as a film maker with all of the success he's had over the last 30 years proves that he is not just a legendary film maker, but a regular guy as well.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"Great fun, just don't think about it","I love Tom Hanks. I know it's a cliched thing to say, but Tom Hanks is the greatest person who is currently alive. And this film really cemented my love for him.I honestly think that without Tom Hanks I would have hated this movie. It's a stupid, stupid idea. It makes no sense and is really contrived. BUT (and this is the biggest 'but' of all time) it works because Tom Hanks is so unbelievably charming.He owns this role, after a while you almost forget that this is Tom Hanks just wandering around an airport for two hours. And it's important to remember that this is just Tom Hanks walking around an airport for two hours, BUT IT WORKS SO WELL.And because Tom Hanks is so great, you really connect with the other characters and feel the emotional weight of all the scenes. You want these people to achieve their goals, even if they are incredibly stupid.Stanley Tucci serves as a great comedic antagonist. He's the villain you love to hate and he adds so much character to what could have easily been a one-note villain.If you're in the mood for a fun, heartwarming movie, then I couldn't recommend this enough.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Another Great Tom Hanks Job,"I was amazed at how well Tom Hanks maintained an Eastern European persona throughout the movie. How others and Victor played off each other was enjoyable to watch. However, the role played by Catherine Zeta Jones was not exceptional. For her to be in love with a married man when she can easily meet many others during her travels doesn't make sense. If the writers put more thought into her role, she would have had a great character to contrast Victors. As for Tom, some would argue that his Victor shows too much ingenuity while coping with being stuck in the airport terminal, but ask yourself, he somehow manages to go NYC from his Eastern European country and he is a skilled carpenter. I would say he didn't play Victor... he was Victor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great movie about little and great people,"This is a great movie about little people with little minds and a lot of power and great people with big dreams and strong determinations. Enjoy it!I think it's one of Steven Spielberg best movies. It has his way of showing emotions throughout although I don't remember him using light and shadows so well as in this movie. Tom Hanks made me eat my words: he is very credible as a foreigner and portrays very well a man of integrity and courage.It's a great story about how people with heart, passion and integrity can achieve more power and affect positively more people's lives than the duly appointed officials with all their titles and regulations will ever achieve in their lifetimes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Another half-baked film from Steven Spielberg,"It's been over a decade since Spielberg had his one-two combo in 1993 with a groundbreaking futuristic action film (Jurassic Park) and a truly beautiful historical drama (Schindler's List) and, unless you count Saving Private Ryan (which, in my opinion, has several ingenious scenes but is too long and has a lot of filler) it's been that long since we've seen a truly memorable offering from the great master of the 70s and 80s. That's not to say that he made a bad film; there's some to be said for Catch Me If You Can, Minority Report, Amistad and, to a certain extent, AI as well; but none of these show any sign of the brilliant and original spark of the genius who created Close Encounters, Jaws, ET, Indiana Jones, The Color Purple, Empire of the Sun, or Duel. On the contrary - Spielberg seems to have created a monster he cannot control, and each film he makes seems, at least a bit, like a cruel parody on him, as he employs every Hollywood cliché that he himself invented all those years ago.The Terminal is no exception. Spielberg's third collaboration with Tom Hanks - who (apologies to the hordes of Hanks fans out there), be he an astronaut, a boy in an adult body, a detective, a con artist or a refugee from a war-torn country, will always be Tom Hanks - which, like the other two, is based on a true story, is by far the weakest of the bunch. The film starts out with a great and fascinating premise, as a biting satire about the cruelty of capitalist bureaucracy, and as long as that is the subject, it's both funny and touching, as it shows the way the Uncle Sam treads all over the little man. Spielberg, however, doesn't manage to fill more than thirty minutes with that concept, and soon enough we find him swimming towards the safe and known shores of physical humor and romantic comedy. The story about the man forced to live in an airport is of course a terrible stretch, but it gets across and manages to convince; once Catherine Zeta Jones steps in is when the story becomes unbelievable. The film soon turns into a cheesy, unconvincing romance with some really bad dialogue, and loses all its uniqueness and originality.Obviously, The Terminal has its moments; it's Spielberg, after all, and is entertaining at the very least. I expected more, though. In all likelihood this is Spielberg's worst movie, or at least the worst in some years. This one is good for a video rental, no more.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Terrible,"Under two hours, feels like three. One funny character, a couple of good moments. As my wife said: ""I knew it wasn't going to be good, but I didn't think it would suck my butt.""Catherine Zeta-Jones is miscast & her part is uninteresting and unsympathetic. Tom Hanks is dull & puffy. Stanley Tucci gives some life to the film but his character is poorly written. The plot is ludicrous.The good news is that the Clinton documentary has opened & Fahrenheit 9/11 will be opening soon. Two interesting documentaries to enjoy for the summer. Terminal, however, is empty and full of itself at the same time. Whatever you do, do not go see this movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Super good!,"Love it! It's just awesome good, you should see it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
An empty concept brilliantly exploited,"It is particularly interesting to see how Hanks can make a nice movie out of nothing. The concept of someone arriving to New York and having to stay at the airport, is not likely to produce any funny situations, but surprisingly in this movie it does. I can't figure out if it is because of the amazing qualities of Hanks, or the creation of sufficiently interesting encounters. In the end, I think, there are just a few actors and actresses out there who can be placed in any situation, setting or plot and succeed in making a great movie out of it. Hanks definitely is one of those. The role played by Zeta-Jones on the other hand doesn't remains pretty empty and little appealing. She doesn't succeed in adequately supporting Hank's part. After all a nice and entertaining movie, but not worth an Oscar either.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Novraski,"**""The Terminal""** (2004), directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks, is a heartwarming dramedy inspired by true events. Here's the story:The film revolves around Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks), a man from the fictional Eastern European country of Krakozhia. Viktor arrives at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport just as his homeland undergoes a sudden coup, causing his country's government to collapse. Due to this, Krakozhia is no longer recognized by the U. S. or international authorities. His passport and visa become invalid, leaving him stateless and unable to enter the U. S. or return home.Viktor is forced to live in the airport terminal indefinitely, as he waits for his legal status to be resolved. While initially confused and frustrated, Viktor makes the best of his situation. Over time, he adapts to the airport environment, building relationships with staff, finding ways to survive, and even picking up odd jobs. His kindness and resilience endear him to many, although the airport's strict and ambitious head of security, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci), views Viktor as a nuisance and tries to force him out.During his stay, Viktor befriends airport employees and even falls in love with Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a flight attendant. Despite the challenges, Viktor remains optimistic and driven by a personal mission-his visit to New York has a specific, heartfelt purpose that slowly unfolds as the story progresses.The movie showcases themes of hope, perseverance, and human connection, with Viktor's simple determination standing in contrast to the bureaucratic coldness around him. His time in the terminal becomes a journey of personal growth and discovery.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Loved hearing Hanks Speak Bulgarian,"Hello,I am a Bulgarian-English interpreter from Massachusetts and it is not every day I hear Bulgarian in a movie (or on the street, unless I am in Sofia)! My husband and I got a real kick out of Hanks speaking Bulgarian - it would have been a little better if they had had him hailing from the actual country rather than a fictitious one. (Although a drawback to that might have been confusion over the war - most Americans are not familiar with current events in the Balkans and might think that, God forbid, Bulgaria was at war.) Although his accent was not perfect (for example, he routinely put the emphasis on the wrong syllable), that is really splitting hairs...how many actors would reember that mustard is ""gorchitza"" in Bulgarian?! Compared to other, fake sounding Hollywood Eastern-European accents, (the Russians in Rambo III; anything Dracula,) Mr. Hanks did an incredible job with a difficult language. Fun film overall.

The Terminal — Endearing romantic comedy set in an international airport,"The Terminal is an endearing romantic comedy with a slavic foreigner, played by Tom Hanks, trapped in an international airport due to an uprising in his fictive home country. That is an unorthodox setup. Add to that an uptight by-the-book security officer unhappy with those complications, and a beautiful female flight attendant, played by Catherine Zeta-Jones, trapped in her role of mistress, and you get an idea of what's going to happen.It's an improbable, but possible, situation that gives rise to a number of comical scenes, very well played by Hanks. He's very believable in his role, showing a lot of work. Nice camera shot, transitions, soundtrack, and editing. Steven Spielberg knows his work. Zeta-Jones is perfect for her role, and is simply beautiful.The end had a few change in direction, which was appreciable, and even if it got a bit rosy, it was still pretty solid.On a side note, I thought I recognize our Montreal Mirabel airport, and after checking it out, it turned out to be so.Good entertainment, see it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Culture Shock,"Loosely based on a true story of a Middle Easterner stranded in Paris, THE TERMINAL is Steven Spielberg's latest film, and he manages to pull off something of a miracle--a series of comical moments integrating themselves into a good story.Tom Hanks, who was superb in previous Spielberg films SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, is once again sterling in his role of Victor Navorski, a native of the fictional East European country of Krakozhia who finds himself totally stranded at New York's JFK Airport when his country falls victim to a political coup.  The airport's homeland security chief (Stanley Tucci) can't get him on a flight back; and because the U.S. government doesn't recognize Krakozhia's current (if temporary) regime, Tucci can't even allow Hanks to take one step out of the airport's International Arrivals Terminal.  Thus, Hanks sets up ""home"" at Gate 67 and subsequently makes life for Tucci and his security guards a living, comical hell, with his constant misunderstandings of American culture and political protocol, making friends with some of the airport's behind-the-scenes people, and attracting the eye of a romantically confused flight attendant (Catherine Zeta-Jones).Spielberg's ability to get laughs from this film's situation far exceeds the below-average attempt he made twenty-five years ago with ""1941.""  Yes, there are some slapstick moments, but they are better integrated into the story and are not the ENTIRE story, as they had been in ""1941.""  Hanks and Spielberg, who have become our era's equivalent of James Stewart and Alfred Hitchcock, are of course matchless, and Zeta-Jones isn't too bad herself. Tucci makes for a very solid kind of heavy, and THE TERMINAL also pokes political holes at what constitutes ""Homeland Security"" in the post-9/11 world we find ourselves living in now.Highly recommended for its quirky style, THE TERMINAL is yet another reason to treasure Spielberg as a cinematic American treasure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Probably Spielberg's weakest film,"This film is lazy and flawed, especially when you find out it is loosely based on a true story. This film would have been good in the late 80s or early 90s but as audiences are more questioning, there is a lot that doesn't fly. For instance why did they not get a tramslator in the first place. Victor can't speak English when he first arrives but manages to construct a faitly complex sentence when meeting Stanley Tucci's character the day after. It would have been better just made this a true story than commercial fictional story based on a true story. Even Tom Hanks accent doesnt hold the whole film. Shame as the cast was strong, but the storyline seems to have been written by a 10 year old.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Great movie for the whole family,"I was very surprised of so many negative comments about the film. You can't expect everything to be true. Sometimes you just need to accept the story and go with it. The film is about Viktor Navorski (wonderfully played by Tom Hanks) who unexpectedly became stranded at JFK airport because the government of his country (made up country in Europe) was overthrown. Since the country no longer exists his visa to enter US got cancelled and all the flights back home were suspended as well. Not knowing what to do with him the head of airport security Dixon (played by Stanley Tucci) lets him stay in the airport until the situation is resolved. Viktor has very little English at first and does not grasp the situation. He has a goal to go to New York City to fulfill a promise to his father. As he settles in Gate 67 (which hasn't opened yet), he begins to learn how to survive. In the meantime, he befriends airport workers and even airport security. Being stranded in the airport myself, I can sympathize with Viktor. Even though the story is stretched a bit - living in an airport for more than 9 months is obviously impossible - it is still a very warm and at times funny story. Forget all negative comments and rent this film, you won't be disappointed. 10/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Sadly, Viktor Navorski, a man, who planned only a short term visit in New York city, is stuck at the airport, because of unfortunate events in his country and the American officials' inability to deal with this unexpected situation. The story shows how one man, against all odds, manages to provide for himself and his needs using only his own wits. Although not popular with the officials, he's friendly character earns him friends among other ordinary people. Although set in the US this drama could have take place anywhere in the world, where foreigners (especially eastern-Europeans) are still considered second-class citizens.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Spielberg's comic masterpiece.,"Steven Spielberg has proven himself to be equally adept at at number of different genres, but comedy has been the one genre wherein success eluded him - ""1941"", his one flat-out comedy, was also his one complete artistic failure. ""Hook"" was a largely comic fantasy, but was neither entirely a comedy nor entirely successful (though it is a better film than some of it's most vocal detractors have implied). ""Catch Me If You Can"" was, before now, the closest Steven had come to comic success - but that excellent film is really as much drama as comedy.While ""The Terminal"" has been marketed as a comedy-drama, this really is a true comedy, with some dramatic elements. Unfortunately, our society has been dumbed down to the point where people think comedy means ""Austin Powers"". Here, Spielberg had succeeded completely at creating another classic, and Tom Hanks creates the most endearing character he has played since ""Forrest Gump"". ""The Terminal"" is hilarious, touching, fast-moving and entertaining, and the biggest stretch Spielberg has faced since ""Schindler's List"". It is one of his most character driven works to date.Sadly, we have reached an appalling mentality among many filmgoers, especially those who congregate on the internet, wherin any upbeat movie that makes you feel good is trashed, regardless of quality. Anyone of even moderate intelligence realizes that there is room for many types films, and a truly well-made ""feel good"" movie which is not shamelessly manipulative or contrived can be a great thing, which is exactly what ""The Terminal"" is, along with being the best film of the summer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Great story and movie,"A movie like this comes along rarely. Not like your typical special effects oriented, credibility defying trash that Hollywood has been churning out for the masses. This movie's premise is simple and unpretentious, and is the basis for a wonderful bit of story-telling.Sometimes we get caught in the wheels of circumstances beyond our control and we have to learn to deal with it. The terminal is a microcosm of life, the routine and the monotonous part of it that we can't seem to escape from. Hanks accomplishes the feat and goes beyond, playing the English challenged Victor Naborsky as he arrives in New York in order to keep a promise he made to his dying father. He is not bitter. He does not complain. He goes about making the best of a dreadful situation in his unassuming but humorous way.If you did not appreciate The Terminal the first time, may I suggest you watch it a second time. This movie will grow on you.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Manipulative attempt to re-create the magic of Capra,"Film-makers frequently find themselves going back to basics or back to their roots in order to find inspiration, rather than seeking innovation. Two of Hollywood's arguably most powerful men - Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks - did precisely this back in 2004 with the release of The Terminal, apparently based on the 18-year stay at Charles de Gaulle airport experienced by Iranian refugee Mehran Karimi Nasseri (although the film-makers and producers have failed to acknowledge it). Spielberg had been striving for bid-budget, CGI-laden blockbusters such as A.I.: Artificial Intelligence (2001) and Minority Report (2002), and historical epics like Amistad (1997) and Saving Private Ryan (1998), before he made The Terminal. Although those films were generally good to very good, Spielberg returned to something more simple and heartfelt; something in the vein of Frank Capra or Billy Wilder, who combined sentiment and romanticism to such a glorious effect. Well, to be frank, he shouldn't have bothered.Victor Navorski (Hanks) arrives at JFK International Airport from his (fictional) home country of Krakozhia, with the intention of getting the autograph of a famous jazz musician who was loved by his late father in New York. Though what he doesn't know is that Krakozhia's government has been overthrown, leading do a devastating civil war. This puts Head of CPB Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci) in a difficult situation, as America no longer recognises Krakozhia as a country, voiding Victor's passport and cancelling his right to leave the airport doors. So Victor sets up home in the terminal, making money by returning baggage carts back to their holders for 25 cents a cart, and befriending the various oddballs and desperado's in the airport. He also meets flight attendant Amelia (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an emotionally unstable woman who is in a relationship with a married man. Despite Dixon's frequent attempts to thwart Victor's activities, Victor becomes extremely popular with the airport's inhabitants by performing various good deeds.If there is one thing that Spielberg's movies are frequently lambasted for, it is for their cloying sentimentality. Even his darkest output, such as Minority Report and Munich (2005) had their moments of emotional embraces to the sound of a string score that felt shoe-horned in. With The Terminal, Spielberg has gone all-out with the rom-com aesthetic. The result is a manipulating and almost fraudulent throw-back to the great Cary Grant films of the 1930's, capturing none of the magic of Spielberg's idols. Hanks is good value as always, but the character of Victor is almost offensive in it's stereotyping of the simple, almost idiotic foreigner.The collection of supporting characters don't fair much better either, with Dixon's Hitler-esque CPB man raising questions as to the reasons behind his hatred for Victor. Everyone else seems to like him, even his own men, so is he doing it for career progression? His own soon-to-be- retiring boss informs him that empathy and humanity are key to the job, and if Dixon needs to be told this, then how has he gotten as far as he has up to now? Zeta-Jones's Andrea at least puts a different spin on the familiar rom-com heroine, with her erratic behaviour and questionable decision-making at least adding a bit of dimension. The most impressive aspect of the film is actually the set, built from scratch after no airport agreed to allow Spielberg to film for such an extended amount of time, and this, if anything, adds a flow to the way the film is captured. But when the set is the best thing about a film, you know you're in trouble, and this is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's worst efforts.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

The film makes you really feel for the main character Viktor, and really hate the protagonist Dixon. You cheer on Viktor in his quest to get to New York, and in his romantic pursuit of Amelia. The supporting characters are hilarious, and well developed. Kumar Pallana is brilliant as Gupta. He deserves a best supporting actor Oscar. Viktor has two very touching moments: 1. when he reveals to Amelia the story of the Planters can of ""Jazz"" and why he is waiting in the airport 2. when he presents the fountain to Amelia, and tells her he is ""waiting for her"". Great performances all around, family friendly, and a real feel good story you're guaranteed to enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a Russian stuck in an airport terminal when his country ceases to exist.","Starring: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci Imagine that you're flying to a foreign country where you really don't know the language all that well. While you're in the middle of your flight, there is a war in your home country and the government is overthrown. Essentially, your country ceases to exist. When you get to the foreign country, they won't let you in without a valid passport, which you can't get without a country. So they tell you that you can't leave the airport terminal. That you have to wait there until further notice.That's the situation that Viktor Navorski (Hanks) from Krahkohzia (yes, it's a fictional country, and I don't have the first clue how it's spelled) finds himself in.The Terminal is an absurdly amusing comedy/drama that's all the more entertaining because you have to wonder, what if something like this actually happened? Is it possible? I really don't know, but I'd hate to think that someday I'll be out touring the world and get stuck in some foreign terminal for nine months when Canada stops existing.So since Viktor has nowhere to go, he makes a life for himself at JFK Airport in New York City, unable to go into the United States and unable to fly back to Krahkohzia. He makes a room for himself at Gate 67, an abandoned gate that is in dire need of construction. Without the ability to buy food (Krahkohzian dollars are not really worth anything in the States), Viktor has to find alternate means to feed himself. Soon he discovers that when you return baggage carts to their stalls, you get a quarter as a small reward. So he runs around the terminal collecting a whole bunch of them so that he can feed himself.We don't really find out until very close to the end of the movie just why Viktor came to America. But he does finally accomplish his task, and his country is reestablished and he gets to return home.We all knew the ending from the beginning of the movie. The real fun of it is how the movie answers the question of ""What if.?"" Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (definitely worth watching)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

An all time favorite.,"This for me is a Christmas classic (yes I consider it a christmas film) and to be honest with you, it's one of my favorites. Directed by Steven Spielberg and based on a true story of a man stuck in an airport terminal for 18 years. Might sound impossible but in 1988 exactly that happened.This is for sure a feel good film, but to get to that happy place you have to travel on a roller coaster of emotions. This film will take you through it all, comedy, romance and you might even shed a tear or two at the end. You're here for the journey and will experience it all with our main character Victor as he tries to get by in an unprecedented situation, without being able to speak a word of english. So sit back and relax as this is a slower paced film, but one you will become invested in. Perfect for those cozy nights on the sofa, whilst the snow falls and the fire Roars.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
The Terminal Hits Home,"Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have a good track record when they team up. Not that each does not have a good record of his own, but putting the two talents together has, twice in the past resulted in success. Their latest effort, The Terminal, although a strong production, lacks something the other two possessed. It is reminiscing of Catch Me If You Can. Both feature a main character that plays the mouse just a little smarter than the cat. In Catch Me If You Can, the cat and mouse comparison is more obvious whereas in The Terminal, the cat in not trying to catch the mouse, he's trying to get rid of him.This time around Hanks is playing the mouse instead of the cat. He's a man who has become a citizen of no country during his time in the air and therefore, is forced to wait out his homeland's problems in JFK airport. Although the movie is based on true story, Spielberg and his crew have decided to leave all actual details out of their telling. The country Hanks' character, Victor Navorski, was from is fictional and whereas the man the story is based on resided in the airport for 15 years, we don't know whether or not Hanks waits out the problems for weeks, months or years.Still, the story is not dependant on small details as is more a study of the survival of a man in a most unnatural habitat, waiting to go home. How long can you live on saltines and condiments (aka free food)? Where do you sleep? What do you do all day in an airport? The screenplay takes liberties in addressing these questions (there just happens to be a whole gate under construction for the entire duration of his stay), and if the screenplay had fallen into wrong hands, The Terminal would have been terminated. There are still moments when the film skids along the lines of disaster but usually the colorful cast brings it back to safe ground.Actually, the characters are the most believable aspect of the film. Most likely it's because they are all well acted. Hanks plays the entirety of his character arc seamlessly combining elements of the lost boy form Big, the father from Sleepless in Seattle and the resourcefulness of Forrest in Forrest Gump. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the brunet version of a blond, but it's not her fault. The male screenwriters cast her as the damsel who's in distress about life. The cast is completed by Stanley Tucci, Diego Luna, Kumar Pallana and Zoe Salana, each taking on a unique part that round out the character study of that makes up Victor's friends.The movie is neither a drama nor a comedy. It effectively mixes the two and creates a touching, unique film about what we do for love. ***/*****",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Undoubtedly an amazing cinema.,"This is one of the best movie i have seen so far. I loved Tom hanks acting, he lived in the character not to forget that almost everyone gave their best on this. Very crisp writing and neat screenplay. Ego, Love, Humanity, Friendship, There's everything in the movie that represents a kind and best human. I usually skip some scenes that are dragged but i did not find any unnecessary scene. One of the best movie in Tom hanks filmography.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Waiting can be exciting It can be also entertaining,"Tom Hanks is really so calm, so likable, so emotional, so funny and so real in what he does Here, he's a very dignified person who is extremely trusting and always full of positive hope You couldn't insult him if you try It's very hard to hurt his feelings He finds the bright side of every angle problem he faces and finds a way for him to live with the situation He has the virtue of patience, and the testament to hard work, perseverance, and humility He loves people, and he experiences the culture in an odd way",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

"A wonderful story about loneliness, friendship, drama, romance, time, dreams, persistence, kindness","It was interesting to see the changes in the characters of Tom Hanks and Stanley Tucci. In the first, the hero begins with the status of an unknown person, no different from other emigrants to America, to a local hero, a favorite of the public and not only the people in the film, but also captures the hearts of the audience watching this film. Tucci's character moves from the phase of a good person (one who defends the rights of America) to a villain who crosses the path of the main character for his cause, one might say his whole life. The film itself, in my opinion, is a prototype of Forrest Gump, if not 100%, then definitely 50%. The director of the film has a lot of respect for the work done, because the film turned out to be atmospheric, interesting, holds your attention for a whole 2 hours, and this is not so easy, and this person was Steven Spielberg, it's not surprising why the film turned out great. And I want to choose a phrase that fits the film: ""Everything has its time.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
what a feel-good movie!!,"I can't say enough good things about this movie...I liked it so much, I've even bought a copy AND also a copy of the great John Williams soundtrack!! This movie is so full of the wonderful idiosyncrasies that make us human...one can actually visualize persons/personalities doing these things in real life!!I have seen the movie in full about 8 times since spring '05, and I never tire of it. Spielberg has nailed the personalities of the characters portrayed...and couldn't have done a more superb job!! (actually, I am not aware of ANYTHING Spielberg has done that could possibly be considered substandard!!)",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
"An entertaining, heart warming spoof","If Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg are involved, the film is sure to be a winner. The script was creative, imaginative and unpredictable. Zetta-Jones and Tucci played their unrealistic characters in believable roles. The rest of the supporting actors were superb and won my heart. The timing, blocking and direction of the sets were as good as it gets and the music flowed brilliantly. This is a film for everyone of every age and race. The story lead us to believe that Victor and Emilia would eventually fall in love. I was impressed that Victor and Emilia just shared eye contact in the end as opposed to falling into each others arms and leaving together. The entire ending was filled with compassion with the police officer, the custom agent and the janitor braking the written rules. It is a film for all ages, races and creeds. Great job! I'll see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
good,"beautiful film. As to the usual one, the usual negative comments which talk about a classical film some years 80 which everyone does not like it to the nostalgic ones are met.Sure Heros that this film had to have a judgment in this site. In fact reviewers' good part has put a high vote to the previous episodes. Because this contrast? I know the reason. Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is ""better"" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular. At this point should reject also the old episodes but there are here two weights and two measure.In fact also cinema masterpieces have been criticized and denigrated. Good part some reviewers of this site belong to the very bad reviewers. Better think separately with its head. I was sure that the god fun old episode did not like it. Who has to be withdrawn is not george lucas but the last reviewer SAMPAT GO AWAY. Cary Guffey",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"

Definitely a feel good film. Worth anyone's time!,"I had to write a quick review for this film. Tom Hanks is absolutely amazing as always. One of the best actors out there in my opinion and I think this movie really tested his talents as playing someone who is foreign with such an accent must be pretty hard, but once again he did this to perfection! It's a great story and very heart warming as each character is believable. Plus more than a few belly laughs in there too. It's a light hearted film and doesn't take itself too seriously so I don't know what these 1/10 people have seen. It certainly can't be this movie. Maybe the haters need to lighten up a bit :) Im a very judgemental person and I don't usually do films like this but it's a must see and Viktor is such a great character :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
Very late to the party,"This movie is just so great! It puts what we call comedy to shame, and at the same time has a heart-touching story behind it. More than anything, this is a story of human connection, friendship and dedication. The whole movie is nothing short but adorable.The romantic story is short but also kind of pales in the comparison with the friendships that are developed. There's very little cliche, and even that pertains only to Viktor's dead father (main character sob backstory cliche). Honestly, I miss this kind of creativity, originality and backbone in films lately.It's just kind of heartbreaking how unrealistic it is in today's context that people come to care about one another like that without expecting something in return.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Romance"
