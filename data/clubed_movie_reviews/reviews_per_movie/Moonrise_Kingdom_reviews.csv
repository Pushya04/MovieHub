An ambitious film which for the most part delivers spectacularly,"Saw this just now in a small indie cinema in Heidelberg, Germany and I have to say, it was a romp. In my humble opinion this film manages to be both Wes Anderson's funniest picture so far and his most melancholic. The utter uncompromising stylishness of his other work is also present here, perhaps even heightened, but in contrast to The Life Aquatic (and to a certain degree The Darjeeling Limited), the emphasis here is firmly on plot. The brave and often odd visuals never overwhelm the story and the audience never feels like they are not quite in on the joke, like in The Life Aquatic. The tone does tend to become a bit erratic, especially in the last third of the film when Anderson seems to want to pack so much into every frame that the film becomes a bit cartoonish at times (hence the not-perfect score from me). All in all, though, the plot is very balanced and the pacing is great. The two young leads are superb and the brave move by Anderson to place unknown actors front and centre pays off beautifully. The rest of the cast is on paper even more star-studded than The Royal Tenenbaums and yet Anderson never steers into unnecessary character development just to accommodate his stars. A touch here and a touch there are more than enough to paint a picture of a group of people who are eerily similar in their dissatisfaction with their lives and yet react quite differently to the two young lovers' dash (literally) for happiness. In conclusion, a must-see for Anderson fans and highly recommended for everyone else.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Possibly Anderson's best film in terms of style.,"The year is 1965 and a remote North Eastern coastal community is plunged into confusion when it discovers that two kids have run away. Sam, a discontented Khaki Scout, and Suzy, a put-upon older sister and forgotten daughter, abscond into the forest to escape their dissatisfying existences. The responsible adults – Sam's Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) and Suzy's parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) – and the entire town set out on a frenzied search, which gets wild when the largest storm in recorded history touches down and puts everyone's life into question. What ensues is a battle between youth and age, hope and disillusionment, faith and cynicism.In terms of story and character, Wes Anderson's previous films, especially The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling Limited, are superior. Even in the most compelling relationship in the film between Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Sam doesn't embody Anderson's ability to take his characters into deep emotional places of hurt and healing without melodrama. However, the newest addition to the Anderson canon is a cinematic experience.Moonrise Kingdom's story, co-written with Roman Coppola, takes a definite backseat to style, as Anderson saturates the entire film with a ""Norman Rockwell-type of Americana"". Stylistically, it may be Anderson's most masterful work, as the costumes, sets, and settings transport the viewer to an alternate universe, a place of wonder and adventure. The soundtrack is especially effective, as it recalls a time when things were simpler: Hank Williams was on the radio, and children listened to records instead of playing video games. However, Anderson isn't content with reminiscing about the year 1965. He takes this nostalgia and twists it, infusing the film with a twinge of sadness through the reality of life's disappointments. He doesn't reject the Rockwellian view of America, but argues that it doesn't tell the whole story.Moonrise Kingdom is that place of beauty and passion that we all have been in at least once in our lives – the one place on earth where we believe that anything is possible. It has since been lost, but it persists in our memories in moments of nostalgia.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like watching Lord of the Flies while on acid...,"and I absolutely loved every minute. There's nothing better than when you see actors commit fully to absurdity, and there wasn't a misstep in the entire film, stellar cast and a great movie watching experience. My favorite, of Wes Anderson's films, and what a move picking the two lead child actors - their performances were brave and spot-on. I want to find this island, I want to liquidate everything I own and move there, I just wonder if a place like this still exists in the World? I bet it does. Quirky and humorous, this film doesn't disappoint (or at least I've only heard of 1 person so far not giving it a thumbs up), anyone who doesn't get this film I suspect had a very regimented childhood and didn't take any risks. Great soundtrack, two people near me in the theatre jumped up into the aisle to start dancing (I suspect they may have been there for a second viewing!), the entire audience enjoyed it. Really, Anderson's best film yet in my book, highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Moonrise Kingdom will leave you dreamy and smiling, with a hint of melancholy","Let's try to understand the miracle I have just witnessed. Director Wes Anderson is 12 years old, has just experienced his first love while at Summer camp, and immediately rushed to a camera to tell us, his pen pals, the story. A slightly embellished story which follows the perfect scenarios we would draw at night in our beds at this age. It has all the tiny details, the sense of adventure and the freshness of youth. How someone 43 years old in real life could do this movie is beyond me. The drawback of this miracle for the viewer is that such a jump back into the kind of idealized feelings you had in your early teens leaves you with quite some melancholy when you leave the cinema.It could be that some people do not connect to the movie and just see it as ""adorable"" or ""cute"" and nothing more. But I suppose most people will feel connected, notably because the movie has this straight-to-the-point attitude in both the technique and the story-telling; the story is read to you, not force-fed with dramatic music and whatnot. Just like one of the characters who reads bedtime stories to the others.You might complain about the lack of character development for some of the big names in this film (Norton, Willis, Murray - McDormand less so as she gets more detailed screen time than the others) but I suppose this is wanted: kids will see hints of the issues adults are facing, but can't understand them fully. And remember this is a movie shot by 12-year old Wes Anderson.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Anderson's finest yet?,"In the past, Anderson has whirled us from melancholy dreamscapes set deep below the Pacific to tales of inter-generation betrayals in the name of love, from doomed romances in Paris hotels to deliriously bizarre animal revolutions in the English countryside. But for all the retro-stylings his films so proudly wear, Moonrise Kingdom is Anderson's first period piece - a tender love story set in the sepia-soaked sixties of Anderson's youth that have worked their influence into every one of his movies. It is fitting that this film is his most childlike - not in any way any simpler than his other films (as anyone with an accurate memory of childhood will remember all it's complexities; the way each trivial thing became a nest of thorns), but an accurate and deeply heartfelt depiction of childhood. It is not aiming to be as crushingly dramatic as Life Aquatic or as deeply tragic as Hotel Chevalier, because that wouldn't be appropriate for the story it's trying to tell. Instead, while still bearing Anderson's still surprising streak of black humour (some acts of violence really catch you off-guard; then again, children are violent so hats off Wes), it is largely concerned with the dramas and tragedies of youth. Yes, it is less ambitious than say The Life Aquatic but it also has none of the flaws that that film does (and believe me, I am a massive Steve Zissou fan). Instead, it is perfectly executed, wonderfully acted poignant beauty, with fantastic performances across the board (especially from newcomers Gilman and Hayward). This, while not his most ambitious, is certainly Anderson's most perfect work so far. You owe it to yourself to see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Innocent, beautiful and brilliant fun","Despite the dreadful title, Moonrise Kingdom is simply wonderful.Since his flying start with Bottle Rocket and the triumph of Rushmore, I felt that Wes Anderson had rather tottered off a true path. The Royal Tenenbaums was hit and miss, The Darjeeling Limited was too twee, and The Life Aquatic was simply AWFUL. I take against ANY film that wastes Bill Murray.Moonrise Kingdom doesn't repeat that error. Despite covering ground Anderson's already visited to an extent in Rushmore, MK looks at a teenage crush with fresh eyes, and surrounds it with a fantastic cast of oddballs and misfits. Unlike his films where the characters are irritatingly quirky for the sake of it, these oddballs seem organic to their strange island home. Star among them is Ed Norton as Scout Master Ward, who looks as if he's having the time of his life in shorts and woggles, in charge of a troop described as 'beige lunatics'.Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand and Bill Murray all play their parts but never feel as though they're elbowing for the spotlight, which keeps the mood kind, befitting the hearts of all involved in the search for runaway scout, Sam, and his pen-pal, Suzy.Visually, it's a feast of saturated colour and fabulous design, but - as with the best of Wes Anderson - the devil's always in the detail. The laughs come from minutely observed accessories (keep an eye on the scouts' badges!) and from throwaway truths. And the soundtrack is a great mix of wistful Western and classical pieces. Definitely buyable.Anderson flirts with surrealism, but never gets Burtonesque, controlling his story with a firmer hand and to better effect. His situations might be bizarre, but the people in them are always painfully, wonderfully human. It's also a rare film - one you could watch with your grandmother or your grandchildren, with only a couple of moments where young eyes would have to be covered, and no real violence or swearing.There is an overwhelming feeling of innocence and good will throughout.I loved it from the opening frames, and it only got better from there.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Might be my favourite Wes Anderson film,"The thing that I enjoy most about Wes Anderson films is that they each feel like a great adventure and in this sense I think Moonrise Kingdom is his best yet. It tells that tale of Sam, an orphan on scout camp, and Suzy, a misunderstood girl, as they run away together. At first I found the two actors playing the kids to be kind of limp but after a few minutes I warmed to them and I actually think they were both pretty good overall, particularly Jared Gilman who plays Sam and even more so knowing that it's the first acting he's ever done. The rest of the cast are all pursuing or helping them in some way and there a couple of sub-plots with the island's policeman (played by Bruce Willis) and the parents of Suzy (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand).I thought that the rest of the cast was great. In fairness I am a bit biased because I love Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand but even so I have to say that they were all really good, especially Edward Norton who plays the scout master, and Bill Murray. There are also a couple of minor roles for Jason Schwartzman, Harvey Keital and Tilda Swinton who were also a lot of fun. Everyone in the cast fits into their role really well which is obviously exactly what you want, but not only is that the case for the main roles but also for the less important ones, like the scout troupe (especially Sam's 'enemy'), Suzy's three brothers or the oddball narrator.Cinematography wise I didn't think this movie was particularly spectacular, especially in comparison to other Wes Anderson movies like 'The Life Aquatic' or 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. There were a couple of shots that were cool though, some really long zoom outs (which sounds clichéd but it worked) and the doll house type ones that I love and think are awesome.I wouldn't expect to wet your pants laughing at any moment in 'Moonrise Kingdom' but it is funny. There are a couple of laugh out loud moments and as a whole the jokes are pretty sharp and intelligently done. The reason I like the humour in this movie is that it's a part of the ambiance and feel of it, it won't make you crack up but it will make you have a smile on your face for pretty much the whole thing and leave you feeling strangely happy.That kind of ambiance is really why the movie is so good, and is possibly Wes Anderson's best movie. The whole story is this fantastic blend of reality and child-like dreaming and it's wonderful. At times I felt kind of nostalgic and sad that I'm not a kid anymore. On the other hand it feels like a tribute to those myths and dreams of being a child and it works so well. This is the kind of film that I feel I could watch over and over again, each time spotting something new but also feeling good and enjoying the overall purpose.Definitely go and see it!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Average Wes Anderson tableau,"The average Wes Anderson film - if you liked the other, you will like this one as well. In many ways, it reminded me of the Royal Tenenbaums, but at the same felt more genuine in its intentions and relatively toned down visually. Don't get me wrong, everything is as over-stylized and artificial as usual, but I guess the preteen coming-of-age adventure premise just made the pill easier to swallow?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet, beautiful, and funny","I loved this movie! One of Wes Anderson's best - up there with Rushmore and Fantastic Mr Fox. Top reasons to see this movie:The love story between the quirky dark characters was so sweet. The casting for the 2 lead kids was spot on! You can take kids to this movie. They won't get all of the subtle humor but you will. The music and the film setting. The quirkiness of the filming, scenes, and narrator. Everyone in short pants... classic! Bruce Willis is actually good in it. Beautifully shot. You leave the theater with a smile on your face and a tear in your eye.

Great Cast Bring Innocent Tale to Life,"Moonrise Kingdom (2012)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Teenager love birds Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) run away from their homes to find a better life together but soon a search party is out looking for them. Wes Anderson's latest picture is quite a gem because it's been a very long time since a film has captured the innocence and beauty of young love. Now this certainly isn't a love story but then again the film is so original that it really doesn't fit into any one genre. There's the love stuff but also plenty of great comedy and best of all are the terrific performances from the entire cast, many of which haven't done this good of work in years. Anderson and Roman Coppola's screenplay is so simple yet so beautiful and innocent that it's nearly impossible not to get caught up in this crazy world. The visual style of Anderson is certainly on full display as is the weird and surreal atmosphere that really makes you feel as if you're seeing some sci-fi movie because it just appears to be a different universe than anything you've seen or known. At just 84-minutes without the end credits, there's really no filler or scenes that don't belong. This is a very tight ship that tells its story, gets the characters developed and then moves on. Both Gilman and Hayward are terrific in the roles of the young lovers and it's easy to see that they've both got a great talent and Anderson exploits every bit of it. The comic touch by the two was very impressive and they fit Anderson's world perfectly. Frances McDormand and Bill Murray are both extremely funny as the girl's parents and especially Murray who can play weird like no one else. Edward Norton turns in his best work in years as the scout leader and we even get a strong bit by Tilda Swinton. Harvey Keitel pops up towards the end and it's always great seeing him. Bruce Willis is the one that really jumps off the screen. I remember PULP FICTION brought him back to life in regards to showing he could ""act"" and didn't have to always play Bruce Willis and this film proves the same. Willis is extremely good, funny and at times touching in his part and it was great to see him acting again. MOONRISE KINGDOM isn't going to be a film for those seeking brainless action but those who want something more are bound to be entertained.",,Anonymous,Romance
Contrived Pretentious Lifeless Style over Substance,"Moonrise Kingdom is charming, quirky, cute, affable, well-composed, sentimental, nostalgic and pragmatic; and I HATED IT. When it comes to Wes Anderson films, there are three guarantees: children will act like adults, girls will carry around suitcases, and parents will not understand - Moonrise Kingdom cashes in on the Anderson promises with much aplomb. If you have never seen a Wes Anderson film you might find Moonrise Kingdom to be magical and unique. If you have seen Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tennenbaums, Life Aquatic, and Darjeeling Limited, you will find Moonrise Kingdom to be a tired regurgitation of a one-trick-pony director who will forever try to recreate the popular and artistic success of The Royal Tennenbaums, his truly benchmark work. Anderson is a very creative artist, who freely steals from French New Wave and Italian Neo-surrealism, to craft highly choreographed and visually intricate films that specifically show the audience exactly what Anderson likes and how he likes to show these things; he is an artist who works exclusively in a personal space and so far hasn't compromised his personal artistic vision. And there is also the rub! Anderson is incapable of working outside his space; where he once filmed ""outside the box""...he now is trapped in this box and ironically appears no longer able to think outside that box - he is a hostage of the aesthetics and style that define him. A tale set in the 1965 about two pre-teens who fall in love and escape into a boy-scout fantasy of an adventure, Moonrise Kingdom, while displaying the very artistic template that made him a favorite of cinematophiles, is also incredibly lifeless, pretentious, contrived and frankly, poorly written. A stand-out cast featuring Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, and Frances McDormand are wasted on underwritten cardboard cutout characters that are weighed down by hackneyed clichés and insipid dialog. I do give kudos to the main two leads - the children - they give the film its only signs of life; Kara Hayward would not look out of place in a Goddard or Fellini piece. While the story is mainly about unhappiness, disenfranchisement, and the ubiquitousness of love vs. duty, it also provides no real substance regarding these themes, meandering along until its trite conclusion. Moonrise Kingdom is a film that suffers the failure of style over substance - in so much as Wes Anderson's signature moves such as tracking from perfectly composed room to perfectly composed room, are now too obvious and no longer meld in the wholeness of the cinematic aesthetic, but instead point out, too glaringly, that you are watching a Wes Anderson film. There is a difference between suddenly seeing a Stanley Kubrick image and saying ""oh yeah, this must be a Kubrick film"" to watching a Wes Anderson film and throughout the entire film you are drubbed to oblivion with the fact that you are watching a Wes Anderson film. Within 10 minutes of the opening, I was tired of seeing what I was watching - it was so contrived and such a shameless display of idiosyncrasy that the film became a quest to find something new and fresh in it, and unfortunately there is none to be found. With a script that is full of humor but none of it funny, full of quirky characters but none of them interesting, and full of pretty visuals that add nothing to the story, Moonrise Kingdom seems like the death knell of the prototypical Wes Anderson film. But I doubt this will ever stop him - I applaud his artistic integrity and refusal to compromise with mainstream Hollywood, but ultimately he is becoming Quentin Tarantino - a one-note carnivalist forever trying to recreate the success of his early work (Reservoir Dogs is still by far Tarantino's best work and all subsequent films are the recyclage of Pulp Fiction, the film where QT blew his entire artistic wad, just like Anderson did with The Tennenbaums) by insisting on a personal style that is adored by many but offers nothing new to the medium through which the artist tries to communicate. Like Bill Murray's character, when told to stop feeling sorry for himself, I ask... ""why?""",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Highly recommended,"If you've been following Mr. Anderson's relatively short career, you'll find more of the same here: a film that is full of quirkiness, which I find to be parables of the troubles we encounter in life. I came to this film without any expectations, having read nothing about it in the news so I was pleasantly surprised that the main protagonists are a couple of tweens. Any fears of mine finding a sappy or saccharine story were vanquished and replaced with wonderment following the journey of the two main characters. Both actors didn't seem to have formal training but this didn't stop them from serving the story well. It is down to the genius of Mr. Anderson capturing their human performances which are nothing less than beautiful.I can't recommend this film highly enough!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Artsy but I DO NOT RECOMMEND!,"Wes Anderson movies have always automatically started at a 7/10 for me by default. I have admiration for symmetry and quirky characters executed in such a style. Its everything Wes excels in, it also fun that big time actors are always to be found running around this universe.Fair warning (though it didn't affect the score besides not being higher) there ia a scene I felt uncomfortable with, I'd even say unnecessary. Two actual underaged children kiss, ""french kiss"", touch the others tit and mention another's ""hard on"". Its shot in the most flat and awkward manner so its hard to say its sexualising, more so displays how youngins explore sexuality. From an artsy perspective I understand the reasoning.However from my own biased personal opinion I did not enjoy it, so much so I don't recommend this movie nor will I ever watch it again. Something about a grown man telling young kids to perform acts infront of camera, where children can't consent to such in real life, feels exploitive. Not to mention the sexually indecent culture around Hollywood.In conclusion I will give praise for everything else about the show even rate it well. I don't recommend though. Not trying to have some sort of higher horse here, this movie is high praised so not much I say has impact. Its just my opinion.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I ""get"" Wes Anderson but still think it's a poor film!","I was genuinely looking forward to seeing this, especially as I hadn't previously seen a Wes Anderson film, which appeared a major gap in my experience. I have to say that I found it the most dull, unengaging film I have seen for some time, but I acknowledge the difficulty of being critical of a film that so many consider exceptionally good. It's interesting, though, to see that there are a relatively small number of comments here that articulate the same reservations that I had.In case I was missing something fundamental, I have since read up on Anderson's career and approach and I can see that he has his own distinctive trademark. But is that really such a positive thing? Some of the greatest directors manage to put their own stamp on a film by using their expertise to draw you in (and thereby make you forget who the director is) rather than via an obsessive need to make practically every frame indicative of their style. OK, Anderson likes (e.g.) particular colours and very precise compositions within the frame - and perhaps his fans enjoy spotting such elements - but why should that increase the enjoyment of the viewer? I was intrigued by the potential of the story but I felt all the dramatic potential was lost due to it being secondary to Anderson's quirky and unreal world. E.g. Why does it enhance the film for the characters to display so little emotion and never smile? Why is there a need for distorting lenses?I'm amazed that so many consider the film romantic. Even considering that the kids are supposed to be somewhat disturbed, it's notable that they display so little affection for each other, even when saying ""I love you"" with absolutely no warmth. Like others here, I was also uneasy about a film (especially a comedy) having scenes with two 12 year olds in their underwear kissing, with the girl inviting the boy to touch her breasts and commenting on his erection. I wonder if all those praising the film for being ""cute"" and for its depiction of ""innocence"" would be equally relaxed about their children of similar ages (if they have them) having a similar relationship? Doesn't this send the wrong message to adults watching? Those emphasising the ""innocence"" also seem to have overlooked the boy using a fish hook to pierce the girl's ears, the other boy that was stabbed and the dog that was killed, or is all that OK because it's 'A Wes Anderson Film' and the fans are in on the joke?I accept that this review will have no impact on the fans that love the film, but I'm still inclined to assume that so many like Anderson's style - and the unreal world he creates - that they are prepared to gloss over the lack of substance. But if you haven't seen the film yet and intend to do so, I would urge you to genuinely watch it with an open mind and not be swept along into thinking that if you don't like an Anderson film, you lack an appreciation for subtlety and 'indie' cinema. You may instead have noticed the unlikeable characters, the irritatingly theatrical staging, the not particularly funny in-jokes, etc, etc.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wes Anderson's best? It could well be.,"It's 1965 and pre teen pen pals, Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara  Heywood) agree to run away from home and meet up a year after meeting  for the first time. While the two of them head off into the wilderness  of Suzy's twelve mile long home island a search party that includes  Island Policeman Bruce Willis, Scout leader Edward Norton, Suzy's  parents Bill Murray and Frances McDormand and Sam's fellow Scouts set  about trying to hunt the eloping children down in the days preceding a  huge storm.  I should say from the outset that I am a huge Wes Anderson fan and have  absolutely loved all of his films with the exception of Fantastic Mr  Fox so I went in expecting great things. My expectations were matched  and even perhaps exceeded. I loved this film. Anderson sets up Suzy's  home life in a fantastic opening sequence which features some exquisite  tracking shots through the family home. Before anything is said it is  already obvious to the audience that Suzy is a loner who longs for  something bigger, something more. Her parents do not get on and are  never even seen in the same room, let alone talking to each other. She  has three younger brothers who appear to get along very well. Her house  is large and well furnished, indicating wealth if not happiness. All of  this is established in one long sequence of beautiful camera movements  which last no longer than a couple of minutes. Sam's life with his  Scout troupe is shown in a similar manner although it soon becomes  apparent that he has already escaped in search of his love, Suzy.  One of the things I love about all of Anderson's films is that you  could turn on the TV at pretty much any moment during any of his films  and within a few moments be sure that you are watching a Wes Anderson  film. His style is very distinctive and it's all over his latest work.  The shots are framed to perfection and each camera movement feels  measured but not forced. There is a vague pastel and brown tint to  everything which matches the film's period setting. Everything from the  sets to the characters also feels slightly off centre and as though  they inhabit the same world as The Royal Tenenbaums and The Darjeeling  Limited. Anderson not only creates his own world for each film but his  films feel somehow connected and as though they too inhabit the same  slightly odd world.  The plot is absolutely delightful and sweet. It's such a touching and  loving story which also feels like a love letter to the children's  adventure books of which Suzy reads throughout the film. Though they  read these books, the children long for an adventure of their own and  have finally embarked on one. The characters are equally enchanting.  Sam and Suzy are somehow both old beyond their years but also very much  still children. They have obvious intelligence and wisdom but convey it  through a child's eyes. They are on the cusp of adulthood but somewhere  in between. The acting of Hayward and Gilman is superb and again both  feel both older than they are but also very child like. They are great.  The adult characters are also great without exception. Bruce Willis is  a sad and lonely cop who patrols a quiet island and although he has his  faults is very kind and caring. Edward Norton is an exemplary leader  who also has a big heart while Bill Murray and Frances McDormand, both  lawyers, talk to each other using mostly legal language and although  are not really in love with each other, care a lot for their children  and want the best for them. There are also small cameos from Jason  Schwartzman, Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton, all three of which were  welcome and provided something. The adult cast on the whole was  fantastic.  The score goes perfectly with the on screen action and features a  mixture of militaristic marching music, classical and 60s pop. They  somehow all work together and help to push the story on to it's  frenetic final act.  This is a film with a big heart, lovely story and plenty of laughs.  Although I only just saw it I already can't wait to see it again. It's  everything you'd expect from a Wes Anderson film but as well as being  unusual, wacky and nice to look at also has a sweet story about  adolescence, growing up and first love.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Whimsical and Sharp!,"I will be really interested to see next year's Academy Awards, especially the one for cinematography. This is a course in that subject.

This is the story of a couple misfits, caught in a claustrophobic world where they don't belong. They come form a dysfunctional ethos but maintain dreams they don't understand. They manage to persevere despite the odds against them. This is a lovely film with some of our best actors: Frances McDormand, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, all caught up in their own debilitating existences and trying to move from one day to the next.

Scout's honour,"My young son watched the start of the movie and immediately exclaimed that it reminded him of Fantastic Mr Fox. So right from the off, it is a Wes Anderson film with its quirky photography and performances.You also get the Anderson regulars such as Billy Murray, with newcomers such as Bruce Willis and Ed Norton.Norton as the offbeat scoutmaster fits in well here and we see a kind of performance from him that's been missing for a few years.The real stars are the youngsters. Its a tale of two pre-pubescent, difficult children who fall in love and run off with the adults searching for them. One of them is an orphan, rejected by his foster family and social services may farm him out to a home or even worse.I suppose young kids kissing or exploring their sexuality might be off putting for some but it does have real tenderness and emotion.It is a shame that the pace wavers and loses focus here and there.

"Aside from a few minor quibbles, an amazingly original film that's worth your time.","My daughter went to see ""Moonrise Kingdom"" some time back and she said she felt out of sync with the hype for the film. While she liked it, she didn't think it was as brilliant or wonderful and reviews would indicate. Too often this is the case with very good films. The reviews are SO glowing that you feel let down when you finally see it (""The Artist"" was such a film for me). My experience was a bit difference. Now that I heard how she thought the film was overrated, I expected less from the film--and perhaps this helped me like it more. Now this is not to say I adored the film--it had a few minor problems. Sometimes the incredibly overly restrained acting annoyed me--as I know this was very deliberate but it also occasionally frustrated me--especially with Bill Murray whose one style of acting in recent films has been to pretend he's a zombie. Otherwise, though, this is a must-see picture. Even with its overly mannered style (the singing, the flatness of affect, etc.), the story is so wildly original that it is still very captivating. I wanted to see more when it ended--and that's a good sign.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's about love, the innocence of the 60s, beautiful Maine, and a lot of amazing set design. WOW!","Moonrise Kingdom (2012)It's hard to see anyone not liking this movie on one level or another. It's really really well made, top to bottom. The art direction almost takes front row in this one, in coordination with the photography, creating a plasticky, beautiful, fluid, and highly stylized view of mid-1960s summer camp on an island in Maine. It's breathtaking and flawless on that visual, physical level. It even breaks rules with impunity--rain bashing the windshield and then it's sunny and bright, or waters savaging the town and people surviving by hanging like paper dolls from a church eave.Okay, you should know by now that this is a fable, a fairy tale set in rustic beautiful coastal America. The stars are children even if the famous actors are adults. (You want a list, you haven't yet heard that the cast includes Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Francis McDormand, and Bruce Willis. Yes!)The first analogy that came to mind was ""Night of the Hunter"" for all the slightly and playfully surreal elements in a serious story of children striking out on their own. This one, in color, is less brooding, for sure. In fact, one of things to love is the bright humor all through. It's either hilarious or witty or clever every single second. When it's touching, or even deeply moving, it remains airy and perfect, too.The references, subtle and obvious (from Tang to Boy Scout patches to nods to the movies and their romantic distillations), are part of the content. You know you are watching through a filter. Unlike, say, ""The Artist,"" which sort of re-creates the past and makes it clean and bright and shiny, this invents a new kind of reality that seems to be a perfect example of the past. It doesn't just mime it. It becomes it, fresh. Though utterly false, too, on purpose. Like a memory polished in a mirror.Of the adult actors there isn't much to say. They play their exaggerated parts with restraint (a great trick) and the over-the-top plot keeps finding little things to keep it in check. The movie never quite gets carried away (though the end with the storm does push the limits, switching to an almost-not-quite black and white for awhile, beautifully). The movie does carry the viewer away, however.I saw this with my girlfriend who isn't from the U.S. and she liked the film but didn't love it. It might partly be sense of humor or taste, but I think it's partly how imbedded the nostalgia for the real 1960s is for many of us who grew up then, in the U.S. Everything was, as in the ""Truman Show,"" a kind of nod to a seemingly ideal, safe, happy, ridiculously simple and moral time. Even the immorality here is limited to a touching of hands, as seen through some binoculars.The one thread that I somehow predict will become a problem for born-agains and do-gooders (no offense, to either, I think) is that there is an implicit sanctioning of teenage touching, pre-sex, and running away. I know, it's a fairy tale, but when the main boy is smoking a pipe, he isn't just miming his dad, he's smoking a pipe. When the girl says the boy can touch him where he shouldn't, he does. It's amazingly innocent, but it does imply a freedom unthinkable in the movies of the 1960s, if not in real life.By the way, this is set before the hippy 60s. There is no hint of drugs or even rock and roll. The adults as much as the kids are pure as snow. Just a bit restless and wanting more than what they have. Which is maybe the story of all of us, one point or another.See this. See this. See this.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not for everyone I guess,The one thing this movie has going for it is its very unique style. But to me this can be too much at some points. I loved the set designs and the colors but I didn't care for the story or the characters at all. I didn't feel any kind if emotional connection to them. They all seemed too wacky and unrealistic. It was kind if like watching a cartoon. Nothing in the movie is realistic at all. It was as if it had been written by a child. I'm not putting it down as I'm sure that's what they were going for. I'm just saying its not for me.,6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good Cinematography, Boring Movie","This film is wonderfully shot, and the use of color is intriguing. However there is a distinct lack of substance and likable characters.Seriously Coulda used a dose of Owen Wilson...Everyone Except the 2 main characters and Edward Norton are just agonizing to watch. And I like Murray, Willis, Swinton, AND McDormand, a lot. Murray was just not good, and the others lackluster, although Tilda Swinton was more or less her usual self. The dialogue was at times amusing but the direction was lacking.There is a whole lot of droll monotone soliloquies and quirkiness just for the sake of quirkiness. You knew what was going to happen and yet it took forever and a day to unfold. It's like Wes Anderson took the worst parts of Tenenbaums, Darjeeling, and Fantastic Mr. Fox and decided they were the best, and deserved their own movie. In a word, boring. In a sentence, wait for rental or skip entirely.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Island Girl,"Greetings again from the darkness. Not many people think like Wes Anderson. That's probably a good thing in real life. It's definitely a good thing for movies. He is a creative and distinct filmmaker, though not one with mass appeal. My two personal favorites of his are The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore. His previous film, Fantastic Mr Fox, was a solid hit and critically lauded. Now he delivers one that will probably only click with his core fans. It's a thing of beauty ... if you keep in mind that beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Set on the fictional New Penzance Island off the coast of New England in 1965, the movie opens with terrific visuals of the Bishop family's lighthouse/home. Our tour is conducted as if the home were a dollhouse, and our eyes struggle to keep up with the detailed decor. We are struck by the color palette of tans, greens and splashes of red. This will continue throughout the movie.The story centers around two 12 year old misfits: Sam and Suzy. Sam is an orphan and outcast in his Khaki Scouts troop, and Suzy is misunderstood and ignored by her selfish parents, who communicate with a bullhorn and through legalese at bedtime (they are both lawyers). Sam and Suzy are attracted to each other's misery and decide to run away together. This ignites a flurry of activity on this quiet island and showcases two first time actors with remarkable screen presence: Jared Gilman (Sam) and Kara Hayward (Suzy).The ""grown-ups"" on the island include Suzy's parents played by Bill Murray (a Wes Anderson staple) and Frances McDormand. The island police chief is played Bruce Willis, who we soon figure out is also a social outcast. The Scoutmaster is played by Edward Norton in a regimented weirdness that will have you laughing in confoundment. For such serious topics, Mr. Anderson and co-writer Roman Coppola provide us many comedic moments - both through dialogue and site gags.During the search, other colorful supporting characters get involved. Social Services is after Sam. Tilda Swinton plays Social Services. In one of the few gags, I'll give away, Swinton's character only introduces herself as Social Services. This is a gut punch to a system that is often under-staffed and forgetful of it's true mission. We also get Jason Schwartzman as a very helpful, though slightly seedy, Cousin Ben. Harvey Keitel plays the senior Scoutmaster who is unhappy with Norton for losing a scout. Bob Balaban makes periodic appearances as a narrator ... either for a documentary or for the movie, depending on the moment's need.The script does a wonderful job of capturing how the 12 year old brain works. Some of the scenes with Sam and Suzy are almost like looking a photo album ... exactly the way our childhood memory works. Flashes of moments. The Alexandre Desplat score is heavy on percussion, but it works well with the minimalistic look of the film. It's also interesting to note that this is one of the few movies where it makes sense to have a soundtrack with Benjamin Britten, Hank Williams and Mozart! If you go to this one, keep your eyes open and moving, and your ears receptive. The payoff is worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fabulous Escapist Enteratinment,"There's no live-action director whose movies are more like animated films than Wes Anderson. It's quite fitting that he ventured into stop- motion with ""The Fantastic Mr. Fox"", because the line between that and his live work is thinner than it seems. And never has that been more true than with his new effort, ""Moonrise Kingdom"".Without a doubt, this movie has struck a nerve - in it's limited-release opening weekend, it broke the all-time record for per-screen average at the box office (albeit on only five screens). Even now it's only on 16 screens, but averaged a massive $54,000 per screen. By any measure, this film is a hit. I loved Anderson's breakthrough film ""Rushmore"", but I've been somewhat indifferent to most of what he's done since. ""Moonrise"" is very successful at delivering what Wes Anderson delivers - an absurd, surreal experience - a little precious, maybe - but often quite funny and always interesting to look at. If he's your cup of tea, I think you'll like this one - it might be his strongest movie since ""Rushmore"".Moonrise-Kingdom-007Briefly, it's the story of 12 year-old ""Khaki Scout"" Sam (Jared Gilman) an orphan in New England in 1965, an ""emotionally disturbed"" kid whose foster parents have decided ""not to invite him back"". At a church performance of Benjamin Britten's ""Noah's Flood"" he meets 12 year-old Suzy (Kara Hayward), likewise troubled - estranged from her parents (Bill Murray, Frances McDormand) and sporting a violent streak, she lived for her binoculars, kitten and stolen library books. She and Sam hatch a plan to run away together as a hurricane bears down on tiny New Penzance Island, where she lives and his scout troop is holding their summer jamboree. This sets the town in a desperate search for them, including the affable police chief (Bruce Willis) and the well-meaning scoutmaster (Edward Norton).You should know what to expect here - lots of self-conscious Anderson charm and interesting visual tricks. The movie is a kind of moving storybook, with lots of 360 pans, narrow-field shots as if seen through Suzy's binoculars, and pastel lighting. As all Anderson's films are, it's a love letter to childhood and to social misfits. The adults are mostly well-meaning but hopelessly lost in relating to the kids. Childhood isn't romanticized so much as fetishized - Sam and Suzy are hilariously frank with each other, including on the subject of sex (""It feels hard."" ""Does it bother you?"") and Sam's fellow scouts can be cruel, but also hold a reserve of ""Us vs. Them"" loyalty. Authority is despised (the social services lady refers to herself as ""Social Services"") and only interested in destroying Sam's uniqueness and forcing him to conform.Obviously, Anderson isn't going for reality any more than The Brothers Grimm were - but he is trying to shed some light on childhood using fantastical means. And he largely succeeds, thanks in part to Gilman and Hayward's straightforward charm. I suspect that many of the folks paying to see this movie don't realize that they're the ones Anderson is making fun of, but that's part of the fun in watching an Anderson film. Bruno Wang says: This is escapist entertainment, and how much you care to read meaning into it is entirely up to you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A rare Wes Anderson extravaganza,"Consistent readers of the past few weeks will know that I have successfully watched almost every one of Wes Anderson's films, and his two shorts, Bottle Rocket and Hotel Chevalier, respectively. I conclude my odyssey with one of incorruptible beauty, style, and substantial material. Moonrise Kingdom is an effervescent experience for moviegoers, seemingly existing in its own little world, unlike the last two Wes Anderson films that seemed to be firmly set in a specific, recognizable place, whether it be the ocean or the charming atmosphere of India. This feels like it has erected a world from scratch and its laws and rules from places of heavy beauty.We are greeted with instantaneously likable, precocious children, and if Anderson were to produce a sequel (thoroughly doubt it, too many quirks and new worlds to create and time is fleeting) it would most likely focus on them as morose, unkempt adults approaching a heavy midlife crisis. In a way, it feels a bit like The Royal Tenenbaums, if we were presented with extensive backstory on the Margot character and why she became so depressed and mentally unfulfilled. For once, I believe Anderson wanted to focus on characters when they are happy with their current place in life.Yet the melancholic urges of the director come into play when it is possible that these two spunky twelve year olds may not be allowed to be together. They are Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward). Sam is a ""Khaki Scout"" member at the unusual Camp Ivanhoe on a small and modest island of New England, and Suzy is summering with her dysfunctional and incompetent attorney parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). Their love is so crisp, real, and so beyond their years, yet is not simple lust. It is definitely something more. A mutual understanding is still a tad bit of an understatement.When the counselors at Ivanhoe get word Sam has escaped, they organize a search party, led by Bruce Willis's welcomed Captain Sharp, and eventually round up Tilda Swinton's saucy Social Service executive to join the hunt. Sam and Suzy were pen pals for about a year, before sneaking out of their confines to meet each other. They have come heavily prepared and are destined to lead a life of happiness - hopefully.Anderson, per usual, not only comes prepared with his band of regulars in his casting, but also equips his keen eye for painstaking detail and colors. Here, much of the photography consists of sunlit, grassy plains, evocative shots of the sky as it hovers over the graceful landscapes, and a mountain of beauty occupying every scene in the picture. The framing is astute, the colors are there, including his trademark love for the color red, and everything feels at home here. Sometimes, it is hard to subitize everything on screen. This is the first Anderson picture not to feature Owen Wilson in any specific credit, but he goes on record saying that he was on set frequently, gave advice on the screenplay, and assisted in a lot of the feedback for the rough cuts of the picture. His presence is here, just very muted and missable.It also seems Anderson has incorporated some great morals in the film, as well. They are all executed perfectly, and mainly center on the typical ""young love"" premise, but replace clichés and convention with quirks and eccentricities, present the topic of physical and mental escapism maturely, in way of gratitude, and showcase the drastically distant standpoints between the parents and the child.Moonrise Kingdom impresses me more than Anderson's previous efforts, and ranks right behind The Royal Tenenbaums for my favorite film by him. There's some very crafty filmmaking going on here, per usual, but some of his efforts, Bottle Rocket and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou for example, seem a tad meretricious. They are beautiful films that exfoliate their photography and look, but wind up shunning the humanity aspect I so ever hunger for as a cinephile. There needs to be some sort of a connection with these characters, and only sometimes we can acceptably be deprived of that during impressionistic filmmaking. Wes Anderson's films aren't impressionistic, and usually, have no hard moral behind any of them (not a bad thing, despite sounding like one). Sometimes, he spends so much effort on the painstaking detail and look of it all that he forgets we must spend an upwards of one hundred or even two hours watching characters through a pretty indistinct lens. Moonrise recognizes humanity and knows how to apply it. We care about these characters from the first frame to the last.NOTE: The film's soundtrack is probably the best composed out of all his films. It features several tunes by the country legend Hank Williams, who also happens to be one of my favorite singers. We hear the infectious tune of ""Kaw Liga"" in two or three scenes during the film, as well as some other ones collectively forced into background harmonies. Yet this is shaping out to be a better tribute to him than The Last Ride, his upcoming biopic, looks to be. Though it would be nice to see little Sam and Suzy set the woods on fire.Starring: Jared Gilman, Kara Hayward, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, and Bob Balaban.

"Pure Anderson, but in the end a bit too hollow.","Moonrise Kingdom (2012) -Directed by Wes Anderson. Starring Jared Gilman, Kara Hayward, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Frances McDormand, Harvey Keitel.This film has got so many of all those Wes Anderson's trademarks that it could easily become a fan's favourite: the strange magical feel, the deadpan humour (almost Airplane! slapstick) mixed with that underlying sadness and melancholia, those classic sideways tracking shots across the sets, the reddish colour palette, Bill Murray, the quirky music... This could be nobody else's work, but Wes Anderson's! And yet, at the same time, you may argue, we've seen it all before. Not only there's a strange feeling of Déjà vu here, but also the inconclusive, weightless and wobbly storytelling and the stock characters feel even more exposed than they usually are. Maybe because the central story about 2 young kids who run away from home to find each other and fall in love is so heartfelt and sweet that it almost feels out of tune with the cartoony nature of the world around them.I'm not even suggesting that the cast is not great, because it is: Bill Murray plays slightly against his likable self, Bruce Willis is as sweet as he's rarely been before, Ed Norton's performance too is perfectly pitched and rather charming... And yet despite making this a great ensemble cast each of them actually pulls the film in a different direction and eventually they add very little to the mix. For example, did we really need Harvey Keitel's character in this film? Could Tilda Swinton be anymore two-dimensional?This is obviously an idealised vision of adolescent relationships, where love is honest, pure, simple, uncompromising, and it is probably the best part of the Moonrise Kingdom. And yet, the quirky style, the overloaded music (really too much, too loud and too intrusive in my view. There is never a moment of silence in this film), the over-the-top secondary characters, all enhance this feeling of hyper-reality which somehow prevents you from fully engage with the film. But then again, as I said, this is a Wes Anderson's movie and his fans will certainly love it... I'm not so sure about the casual viewer. As far as I am concerned, I liked it, I'm happy I saw it, I appreciated its technical skills, its meticulous look, its quirky humour (this is one of those films that leave a smile on your face throughout its entire length as opposed to induce out-loud laughs) but in the end it is all a bit too indulgent, slightly hollow and really it just left me a bit cold. And for a film that's all about pure feelings and childhood, that's probably not a great sign.6.5/10 http://wp.me/p19wJ2-z8",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I've liked every Wes Anderson movie that I've seen, and that includes ""Moonrise Kingdom""","Wes Anderson first came to my attention when I saw ""Rushmore"" and I got the feeling that this guy had some good ideas for movies. Over the next fifteen years, he proved this to be true: ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", ""The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou"", ""The Darjeeling Limited"", and now ""Moonrise Kingdom"". This story of an orphaned boy scout and outcast girl who run away together on an island off the coast in New England in 1965 has all the characteristics of an Anderson movie: dolly shots, direct shots of people, and long narration. One of the most impressive things is the soundtrack: a mixture of orchestral music with Hank Williams songs! But more than anything, this movie is about the offbeat world of the introverted main characters. Neither fits in with the surrounding world, but both have something to offer each other. It is one really fine movie, and I am very eager to see Anderson's upcoming ""Grand Budapest Hotel"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty sweet and charming.,"Moonrise Kingdom is one of those movies best enjoyed on a quiet afternoon, sit back and just bask in the childish story taking place in front of your eyes. First and foremost I will say that I think this movie is definitely a kids romance, just without the cheesy stuff you see in other such children's fare like the wimpy kid franchise, and for the adults it has a subplot dealing with the parents and other eccentric characters of the town. The driving force of the film is the young cast, Jared Hilman, who I think looks like a miniature Rainn Wilson, and Kara Hayward are electric together on screen, and their quirky eccentricities are perfectly matched, the chemistry between the two just lights up the screen and you're rooting for them from the get go.The supporting cast are good also, it's nice to see Bruce Williston doing something totally different, at this point in his career it's great that he is so comfortable in his career that he's willing to do a movie such as this, and a personal favourite of mine, Tilda Swinton is also very cool and wonderful. The only time I ever thought the film suffered was when it focused on the adults more than the children, in those parts it seemed as though it didn't know if it was a kids movie for adults of an adults movie that kids can also enjoy, it lost it's balance for a little while but that aside the movie is pretty good all the way through.You'd have to be a bit of a grouch to not enjoy this quirky romance, it has a bit of everything, so hopefully you'll see it and really enjoy it, and let's hope we see a lot more of the exceptionally talented young cast. :)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very entertaining,"This traveling angel satire is quick paced and fun to watch. All the supporting characters have a purpose for being there. The actors deliver and the love story between two teenagers is at moments convincing and at moments funny. Bruce Willis plays a local cop, boring but with a hearth. Edward Norton plays a camp leader stressed out and self centered. Bil Murray and Francis McDormand are husband and wife, lawyers, with a broken marriage. The only negative comment is that there are so many characters that have an arc that in the end the viewers is left with a feeling something is missing. An enjoyable movie. 8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
very disappointed with this film,"I went to this film based on a stellar cast,seeing a segment of a trailer with Edward Norton dressed as a scoutmaster, and reading a couple of good reviews. I like dark and quirky but what I got was slow and plodding. 40 other patrons in the theater with me: not one audible laugh the entire movie. I was a bit put off by what I felt was some mild kiddie-porn. And the girl playing the lead: she was too old for the male lead so it was hard to buy into their relationship to begin with. When the movie ended, I was thinking that instead of going to this dud, I should have stayed home and re-watched the Royal Tenenbaums because I thought that was what this film was trying to imitate. THEN I found out Wes Anderson directed RT also. Save your money and see it on DVD--if at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rather dull and not funny,"Wes Anderson films appeal to those with ""different"" taste in which his style is rather unique for mainstream audiences. Having seen several of his films and enjoying his earlier ones such as Bottle Rocket and Rushmore, Moonrise Kingdom is rather dull, generic and the central characters (12 year old boy and girl) were not too interesting.Rather surprised at this film's high rating. It is universally praise by critics but as watching, could not see as to what the fuss is about.Like most or all of his films, the children act like adult and the humor is quirky and awkward. The comedy here is non existent and the drama isn't exactly thrilling neither. Also rather slightly disturbing scenes showing the 12 year old kids in their underwear and ""French kissing"".One of the positives is that the film is relatively short but even so, it is rather boring. Perhaps one is kissing something to fully understand about this picture.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Poems Don't Have to Rhyme, They Just Have to be Creative.""","Moonrise Kingdom is a quasi fantasy film about love. While the main plot line is the most obvious romance story, there are other stories of love embedded here as well. From the Scout Master who loves his job, to wife cheating on her husband with the Captain, to her dissolving marriage to her husband. Love is the theme of this picture.What is most striking is that the love story between the two children is the most pure, most real love shown in the film. It shows the wonder and beauty that such innocence can bring when it's combined with a deep love of someone.The shots in the film are captivating and lovely, with the final one bringing tears to my eyes. There are also subtle and not so subtle moments of humor. Bill Murray has some great lines that are easy to miss. He's an alluring actor as always, and brings a quiet joy to the film that always supplements Wes Anderson's oddball style. Most importantly there is a heart to Moonrise Kingdom that few films can match.As with most Wes Anderson films this is quirky almost to the extreme. But I reject the notion that this film is pretentious. It's the opposite. It is pure, it is a wonderful meditation of what love should be and how as we age and grow more cynical its true meaning becomes lost on us. Love is a poem that doesn't need to rhyme. But the longer we're without it the more we demand that it does.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
If you like Wes Anderson you will love this film,"¨We're in love. We just want to be together. What's wrong with that? ¨ You either love Wes Anderson movies or you hate them. I am on the loving side since I always find his movies to be hysterical and original. Moonrise Kingdom is a great film with some pretty interesting performances as well. It has been five years since Anderson directed a feature film (that wasn't animated) and the wait is finally over. His last film, The Darjeeling Limited, came out in 2007 and it was a very funny movie, but Moonrise Kingdom is superior in my opinion. I wouldn't say Moonrise Kingdom is Wes Anderson's best work but I know fans of his defer on what their favorite movie of his is. Some enjoy his first film, Bottle Rocket the most; but others have found Rushmore to be his best work. I still think The Royal Tenenbaums is his best film, and it probably has to do with it being the first film of his that I watched. Fans of Wes Anderson probably would agree with me that the first film of his that they watched is their favorite one because of the originality and inventiveness of his style. He has unique trademarks which he uses for all of his films so you probably could recognize his work in the first minute of the movie. His films always seem to deal with some sort of broken family issue where the children don't get along with their parents or are being raised by a single parent. He also uses a lot of color in his films; yellow, green and red predominate. Anderson makes very personal films and sometimes his movies seem to repeat themselves, but he has a unique style that separates his work from other Hollywood comedies. The central theme of his movies are always quirky and bizarre, but in a good way. Moonrise Kingdom is in my opinion his most romantic work.The story is set on the small island of New Penzance off the coast of New England in 1965, a few days before a big storm is to arrive. Walt (Bill Murray) and Laura Bishop (Frances McDormand) live on the island with their three sons and daughter named Suzy (Kara Hayward). Suzy is very troubled; she doesn't get along with her parents and doesn't have many friends. She befriends a young scout named Sam (Jared Gilman) who is at the other side of the island in a summer camp. Sam decides to escape from camp, meet up with Suzy secretly, with whom he's been corresponding through letters, and run off together. Scout Master Randy (Edward Norton) discovers that Sam has escaped from camp and decides to send the rest of the scouts on a search hunt. He also notifies Police Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) about the escape and the Captain connects the disappearance of both children and concludes that they have run off together. While Suzy and Sam hike and set camp together while fleeing from the search party they fall in love with each other. The Captain discovers that Sam is really an orphan and that his foster parents won't accept him back so he has to notify Social Services (Tilda Swinton) about the incident. Sam and Suzy will do what it takes to stay together and not be found, while the entire town begins searching for them.Once again Wes Anderson works alongside Bill Murray and his cousin Jason Schwartzman who has a small role in this film. He's worked with them in almost all of his films, but the difference here in Moonrise Kingdom is that the true stars of the film are the kid actors: Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward. Hayward reminded me a lot of Gwyneth Paltrow in The Royal Tenenbaums. They are great in this movie and had a lot of chemistry together. Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, and Edward Norton also give the film a funny and quirky touch to it. Wes Anderson's trademarks are all over this film and the tone is similar to the others, but it also has some touches that differentiate it from his other works. Having the kids be the stars of the film is a first for him, and the film does have a romantic touch to it despite maintaining a depressive mood throughout. As always Wes Anderson wrote the screenplay for his film, although this time he co-wrote it with Roman Coppola who had worked with him in The Darjeeling Limited as well. His first films were co-written along with Owen Wilson, and Noah Baumbach has also worked with him in a couple of projects as well. His screenplays are always full of quirky humor and bizarre scenarios. That is one of the reasons I love his movies so much. Moonrise Kingdom is a film that Wes Anderson fans will enjoy quite a bit.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

About young love.,"Wes Anderson's melancholic, magical, offbeat and fantastical world has spellbound audiences since his major breakthrough ""Rushmore"" in 1998. Since then his career has gone both back and forth in quality, not so much in subject matter. Anderson's films are more or less about the same things, and his ""auteur"" qualities are admirable and rare in American contemporary filmmakers. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" tells the story about a young boyscout that runs away with a girl during the last days of summer. Families and authorities soon starts looking for them. The performances by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward are good, no question about it, but the writing and handling of them makes them come at a distance - they are more alien than sympathetic, more odd than charming. The cast that surrounds these two are played by Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Bob Balaban and Harvey Keitel - a fantastic ensemble cast.Anderson's highly stylistic approach is turned to eleven and every camera movement, every shot, every bit of dialog and use of clothing is draped in his vision. It's a good thing, but as well known, when style overrides substance and story, one can be left bemused, as I felt.Still, the film gels well, and though it lacks some drama and emotional involvement throughout, there's much to enjoy - simply the pure ambition Anderson lays in trying to encompass the joys and sorrows of growing up in a world that isn't perfect for everyone or for that matter, anyone at all. The impact is as of a sleeper, as the viewer goes along the fantasia of a cinematic place that one is happy Anderson creates on screen, because it can never be in the real world - for both better and worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
the only living boy in New York,"The feeling evoked in the corny but moving Dead Poets Society is also present in Moonrise Kingdom, Wes Anderson's best film to date. It's a nostalgia and also a deeply felt rebellion against sadness, in favor of the individual.The subtle work here is tempered by flippant deadpan humor and hint of fantasy in the events portrayed. It's the way you remember the crazy ideas you had as a kid and the ruthless pursuit of your plans, weird and dangerous plans, but a matter of life and death to you at the time; like the need for something, however small, when you're drunk; the uninhibited desire or obsession that spirals out of control.Two weird young kids elope. That's the story. Again, as in The Royal Tenenbaums and Rushmore there's more than a wink towards Salinger's heroes.The whole film is a delight. It's funny moving and divine. Anderson has got to what he was trying to express and nailed it here.Bruce Willis and Edward Norton are particularly brilliant. This is really a fairy tale in essence. A fairy tale for weird awkward quirky kids.My favorite part is how, in a year full of superhero movies, Suzy's binoculars become the most moving superpower on film: the downbeat confession is priceless.See this film if you haven't yet, it's a gem.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Introspective, Hand-Crafted and Beautiful, But Also Over-Stuffed and Short","Wes Anderson does his thing again with a quirky, rich, melancholy character piece. The particulars may be different, but really he's been making the same movie (in many cases, even using the same actors) for years and this one's no different: it's artfully arranged, leisurely paced and quietly withdrawn. It rewards those with the notion to read in between the lines, embraces the beauty of a natural setting, and cracks awkwardly funny stone-faced jokes at the most unexpected moments. The mood is decidedly childish, both in subject and in perspective, but for the most part that works to put the audience in the right mindset, rather than dumbing things down. It does occasionally overstretch itself, though, particularly as events begin to climax and believability abruptly becomes less of a priority. If you've enjoyed Anderson's earlier pictures there's plenty to like here, although it doesn't even begin to rival Rushmore or The Royal Tenenbaums and I was surprised by the lack of a matching soundtrack. Non-fans should continue to keep their distance.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quite Brilliant.,"Beautiful, Cute and boasting of very good and mature performances from the young duo of Jared Gilman and Kaya Hayward along with great supporting roles by the remaining cast, stunning visual scenery's and extremely good cinematography and a brilliant background score by Alexandre Desplat, Moonrise Kingdom is an extreme pleasing and enjoyable watch which is what it is due to the hard work and dedication of Director-Writer, Wes Anderson who has shown this unique movie brilliantly.The Story which is written by Anderson and Roman Coppola, is about two young lovers Sam(Jared) and Suzy(Kara) who are neglected and mis-treated by their families and decide to run away from their relatives and live a life of their own together and how their adventures begin after they run away and a search party is put to find them and bring them back.The Young duo of Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward have given really impressive and mature performances as the young lovers who decide to run away, and their expressions,dialogue delivery everything is quite perfect and they learnt very well from a very good director. The Supporting Cast of Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray and Frances McDormand who are the recognised actors in the movie also do a very good job in their respective roles and Tilda Swinton also did a great job for her little role in the movie. Overall, the ensemble cast have really done brilliantly here and all of the actors have portrayed their characters really well.Wes Anderson is a real different and unique director who really makes a movie which are brilliant in all sections, and again has done the same here by showing the audience a adolescence romantic movie mixed with drama and comedy which really pleases all audiences and he has utilized the brilliant cast which was given to him to its most potential and also has organized all the other sections of the movie perfectly and by writing the movie he utilized and showed the story perfectly to the audience. He really used his crew perfectly and made a movie which can be enjoyed by everyone.Now I don't really like Romantic stories or movies for that matter but this one was quite cleverly written and is also quite unique and you don't have a choice but to be pleased by its ability to keep you stuck in the movie and Anderson has done a brilliant job in written this very original story with a tinge of comedy and good dialogues which are delivered well by the actors. The Movie was'nt much of a drag either and was to the point, so the editing was done quite nicely.The Cinematography in this is really brilliant and the island is shown so superbly even in the storm sequences that you can't help but get mesmerized by the beauty of the nature, the cinematographer Robert Yeoman really has done well with the lighting and camera-shot from high places. The Music which was given by well known Music Director Alexandre Desplat was absolutely brilliant and beautiful, the back-ground score was amazing and every sequence is backed up with brilliant classical music and other type of music which really fits in with the sequences. Desplat may as well get an Oscar for this, he has really done an admirable job.Well Moonrise Kingdom is definitely a must-watch for anyone who likes to watch good movie and all audiences are bound to enjoy it and get pleased by it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautifully weird, but could be better","The movie is quirky, yes, but you're not gonna like any Wes Anderson movie if you don't like quirkiness. I actually like his style, his way of directing, whatever you wanna call it. I also get why some people would be reluctant to watch it or to say something good about it. The movie is beautiful, it's cute and childish in a good way. But it does lack something, a more compelling story, because the movie is good mostly because it's a Wes Anderson movie. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be much to it. Bruce Willis is not a good choice for movies like this. He's boring, and Wes Anderson's movies are always quite fun to watch. He should stick with action... I don't think he's capable of much else. Edward Norton is great as always.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cloyingly annoying. Pretentious high-brow crap w/ wasted talent.,"From the first scene I knew this movie was going to bugggg me. But as an avid movie goer and fan of many of its stars I decided to stay stayed. The ONLY reason I'm glad I stayed is out of duty to my fellow movie going friends, who like me HATE movies where children speak with ridiculously stilted, staged, and fake adult dialogue. Yes, I get it that this movie is stylized but the dialogue and the way these kids speak is so unbelievable and annoying that it completely takes you out of the moment. And the story itself is completely mediocre - fellow movie goers - the emperor has NO CLOTHES. Really. It's even worse than Darjeeling Express. In that one at least there was hope that it could get better. Here's an analogy for what I thought it was like to sit through this film. Say you can't stand eggplant. And you get invited to someone's house to dinner. You've heard from other friends that the host is an excellent cook. So you look forward to this dinner. You arrive, you sit down at the dinner table and the first course arrives. It's an eggplant appetizer. You eat it because you're a good guest. As you're chewing you realize that every other course that will follow will be an eggplant dish. Eggplant soup, eggplant parmesan, eggplant salad, and eggplant ice-cream. There's NO WAY getting around it. One of the worst meals of all time. Plus, the memory of how awful the meal was lingers for a longgggg time. Yuck.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a beautiful movie!!,"This is one of the best movies of the year. Directed by Wes Anderson, this tells the tale of a pair of pre-teen lovers who elope. The star cast consists of the old Anderson favorites like Bill Murray, Francis McDormand, Jason Schwartzman along with Edward Norton, Bruce Willis and Tillda Swinton. The script is simple but the treatment is magical. The movie is beautiful and captures the innocence and petulance of the youngsters perfectly. After a long time i was able to watch a 90 minute movie in one go as I was held entranced by it. 4 out of 5 for this delightful flick. Anderson fans will be joyous as he hasn't changed his style and remains true to making this genre of cinema. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fabulous adventure.,"Moonrise Kingdom. A fabulous adventure. Insanely beautiful picture! For the first time I was watching a film by Wes Anderson, and I was very impressed by its features, as I later found out, and these are symmetrical frames, bright colors and funny moments at a far distance from the frame. The plot of the film itself is at the same time funny, sweet and to some extent tragic. There are no extra characters and they all complement each other. And the cast of actors here is huge (Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and many others). Moonrise Kingdom is a must-see for anyone who loves or even adores cinema, and I will definitely watch more films from Wes Anderson.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Probably my favorite Wes Anderson film or at least top 3,"The way the colors, sound, and camera shots are so dreamy! In terms of immersive style and endurance involved is so incredible! Absolutely love the follow shots one of my favorite things in cinema along with editing among other things. So much awesomeness that it's soothing. Quite a pleasant thing to own every Wes Anderson film as of recently. Highly recommend this precious art in film, it's not boring like some said.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A near triumph of style over substance,"Wes Anderson is one of the most polarising directors of his generation. Not that his work is particularly challenging. Far from it: for the majority of his career he has seemed content with trotting out the same kitschy and vaguely melancholic style which defined his Oscar-nominated 2001 film, The Royal Tenenbaums. Instead, what makes his output so difficult is that it's often rather difficult to like, with his self- aware, hipstery schtick seeming to obscure the fact that he isn't half as poignant a storyteller as he may like to think he is.With his 2004 critical and commercial flop, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, the novelty finally wore off. And while 2007's Darjeeling Limited helped to regain much of his credibility, his true comeback came in the rather unlikely form of his stop-motion Roald Dahl adaptation, Fantastic Mr. Fox. In many ways, this unexpected side-step embodied many of the components which had already gone stale. It had the same rosy aesthetic, and the blank acting Anderson favours easily translated into monotone voice-acting and rigid puppetry. However, his characteristic mismatch of light superficial humour and moroseness proved to be the perfect marriage with Dahl's bittersweet narrative. While Anderson could often come undone when grappling with more distinctly adult characters, in a child-like but no less imaginative frame, his style took on a more unassuming charm.So it seems Anderson was always cut out for children's filmmaking. Not by contemporary standards, but like the more sinister Disney outings, in which happy-ever-afters only ever came after a decent amount of death and destitution, Anderson seems uniquely qualified to produce darkly moving films for youngsters.Distilling worldly themes into a cutesy tale, his latest outing, Moonrise Kingdom, stands somewhere in between Fantastic Mr. Fox and The Royal Tenenbaums. Sam (Jared Gilman) is a dejected orphan, knocked from pillar to post by social services and unfeeling foster parents. Pawned- off for the summer on a boy-scout troupe, Sam is shunned by his peers because of his violent outbursts, and hatches a plan to escape with his paramour, Suzy (Kara Hayward). Having met at a church pageant, the two begin exchanging letters and bond over their troubles. Suzy is similarly prone to violence and introversion and is kept at arm's length by her workaholic lawyer parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). Using Sam's newly acquired outdoorsman skills, they retrace an ancient Native American trail that leads to an untouched cove, Moonrise Kingdom, in which they hope they can live their lives free from the adult world.Set on a fictional New England island in 1965, the film unfurls in a kitschy, gooey-eyed haze. For those who feel Anderson is all style and no substance, the opening half provides little to convince you otherwise. The acting is muted, the dialogue taut, and Anderson's characteristic aesthetic is left to take centre stage. As such, the emotional core of the story is glossed over by a wash of primary colours and vintage décor, with a ludicrous outfit or a naff piece of Sixties wallpaper serving as weak visual punchlines that carry the film in its first few scenes.However, as the story develops, the stellar cast help to draw out the intricacies behind the characters' cartoonish exteriors. Bill Murray shines as Suzy's impassive and fraught father, while Bruce Willis puts in an affecting performance as the island's lovelorn cop. But it is the two young leads who truly steal the show. Anderson allows for little in the way of actorly flourish, yet both Gilman and Hayward come off diffident and damaged rather than merely blank, and as a result their blossoming romance feels surprisingly sincere.As Willis leads a troupe of deputised, and heavily armed, boy-scouts out in pursuit of the escaped lovers, the story takes darker turns. Blood is drawn, scouts walk away with stab wounds and a puppy loses its life, but the film retains a faint sense of ridiculousness that keeps proceedings light.Stylised to within an inch of its life, Moonrise Kingdom can feel like little more than self-indulgent filmmaking. But while it remains a whimsical, and at times, superficial fairy tale, it retains enough worldliness to make it an engaging film for children and adults alike.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Put a great big smile on my face!,"Wes Anderson has yet to fail me. The Grand Budapest Hotel is my favourite of his so far and I absolutely love Fantastic Mr. Fox. Moonrise Kingdom is easily amongst his best work.Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two kids that love each other and decide to flee from their places of living whilst a search party is created to find them both.I love Wes Anderson's films. He tells such original and interesting stories along with his signature style that impresses me every time. As Moonrise Kingdom came directly after Fantastic Mr. Fox, I feel as if Anderson took inspiration from his work on that stop motion film and implemented it here which I feel worked ver well. There is a level of innocence that comes with Moonrise Kingdom that put a great big smile on my face. It seems like Anderson is taking us on a journey through childhood and adolescence. There is a fairy-tale like quality to this story and I loved the sense of adventure that Wes Anderson was able to create with a story like this. I fully felt as if I got transported into this fictional world with the two kids and the rest of the characters as Anderson does such an excellent job immersing you into its bright and colourful world. The humour in the script from Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola is subtle but funny at the same time once you understand what they're both going for. Anderson also plays with the idea of growing up and has these child actors do and say adult things. There is one scene where Anderson makes a very risky choice where I didn't expect him to go very far but it adds to the innocence, humour and themes that he's presenting.Wes Anderson's style fits this innocent story so well. I adore his symmetrical framing and the cinematography which is filled with earthly bright colours like green, brown and yellow is very appealing to the eye and so unique and different from other films you may come across. The score as well is beautiful to listen to and also adds to the idea of fantasy and adventure. The acting by this ensemble cast is excellent. Child performances can be troublesome especially if they're the lead performances of the film but Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward play their roles so convincingly. They've clearly been directed very well and were so believable as a pair of kids that love each other. It was incredibly sweet to witness. Bruce Willis has been down bad recently so it's nice to see him actually act and play a character. Bill Murray is very funny and Frances McDormand was also great. I love Edward Norton and he does a stellar job in a role I haven't seen him play before. The supporting child actors as well as Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman and Harvey Keitel were all very good.I really enjoyed Moonrise Kingdom and it's easily one of Wes Anderson's greatest films. His style matches this story so perfectly and he uses it to its fullest to create a sweet, funny and exciting film that not only shows his talent but also separates him from other filmmakers working in the same industry.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Started strong but fades a little, still great","It's the 60s on a New England island. Sam Shakusky is attending Camp Ivanhoe. He falls for Suzy Bishop who lives on the island with her parents. The two awkward outsider teens run away setting off chaos among the other characters.This is Wes Anderson's movie all the way through. There is no mistaking his style. He is now as recognizable as any film style ever made. Everything is set up for a good flowing story. They have a dangerous storm bearing down on them. People are out looking for them. But then they're caught midway thru the movie.It detours a bit after that. The pace slows and the story rambles on. It's still very compelling, but it could have been much simpler and better.

A waste of $10,"I went to this movie on the recommendation of my 23 year old daughter. It was disappointing, to say the least. I don't know why she thought we would like this movie!First, a positive. Great cinematography, pretty colors, and nice scenery. The look and feel of the movie is quite pleasant. But for me, that's not enough.I found the story-line quite predictable. I also found the characters to be flat and mostly unlikeable.The acting is amateurish. The only two who gave great performances were Frances McDormand and the actor who played Scoutmaster Ward. Even Bill Murry and Bruce Willis were not at their best in this film. The child actors were dull and disingenuous. The plot moved slowly causing me to yawn frequently. I think I giggled slightly at one part, so I don't understand some of the reviews that say it is funny.It is sad, definitely melancholy as many have mentioned, and simply dull. Oh well.

Moonrise Kingdom (2012) - Wes Anderson's Whimsical Wonderland of a Movie!,"Director Wes Anderson has been well-known for making films that were quite strange and whimsical, where the surroundings are colorful, the characters are dysfunctional, and the writing is believable. He has brought this wonderful gift of filmmaking in most of his films from ""Rushmore"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums"", to ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"". Now, Wes Anderson has finally given us his grandest masterpiece this year with ""Moonrise Kingdom"", which happens to be one of the most creative, magical, and one of the best movies of the year. Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, two new young actors, both play two young lovers in a small New England town during the 1960s. Gilman plays an orphan who has attended a group of Khaki Scouts led by Edward Norton as Scout Master Ward, while Hayward plays a troubled young girl living with her parents, played respectively by Bill Murray and Frances McDormand. These two young lovers both decide to run away with each other, exploring a certain romance. Now, the Khaki scouts and the parents team up with police officer Captain Sharp, played by Bruce Willis, as they try to hunt down and find these two love-struck kids. Wes Anderson has totally knocked the ball out of the park with ""Moonrise Kingdom"". His directing is downright beautiful, since he actually cares about how a film really looks. His filmmaking is seen from almost the entire movie, as he brings his taste of wonder and vision from the sets, props, costumes, to music. In terms of performances, it's the two young actors, Gilman and Hayward, that carry this movie, sharing quite a wonderful and believable chemistry with one another. Although we have a few share of great performances from Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, and Bruce Willis, the supporting cast is also rounded out by a couple of familiar faces from Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Harvey Keitel, and Bob Balaban. It's a ""movie wonderland"" to watch these actors do their stuff. Aside from the goofy and whimsical comedy, to the magical art direction and costumes, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is filled with a glorious use of cinematography that absolutely glows on screen, perfectly capturing every shot and frame in such a stylized manner. The script from Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola really shines, giving each cast member a chance to bring out the wonderful words of dialouge, that although found to be weird and strange, it pulls off easily. So, basically, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is quite a flawless movie, from the acting, directing, writing, set design, costumes, music, cinematography, and tone. It's movie-making at it's finest. Wes Anderson seems to be one of the most creative directors in cinema history. He always knows what his movie should be, and he knows how he wants his story to be unique and different. Although strange and dysfunctional, all his movies carry the same gift of filmmaking, a creative touch and whimsical feel. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a perfect example of Wes Anderson's wonderful gift. This is a wonderful, imaginative, and exhilarating motion picture experience from start to finish. ""Moonrise Kingdom"", in my review, ""a wonderful accomplishment, beautifully creative"".",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A different approach,"It seems there's a divide between those who really enjoyed it and those who really did not. Very few in-betweens.I believe Anderson does things differently for a reason. He demonstrated that you don't need to know a character's entire history to understand them or their circumstances. I read from a reviewer that they disliked the monotone style acting. Again, it's an unconventional approach to acting, but gives it a likable feel. Everybody has a melancholy attitude and some sort of sad story. Their acting style shows, in my opinion, that they're not happy nor completely sad, but simply in a gray area in life where they're not sure what they should be.There seems to be a standard of what good acting or good movies are supposed to be. The rigidity that some people have really blind them from what creativity the director is trying to convey. People tend to place a standard and can't open their mind to new or different concepts.The world set by Anderson is spelled out well by the narrator. The scenarios maintain a sense of realism, but there are moments (often quite funny) of unrealistic happenings. Taken from a rigid perspective, this could leave a person soured. However, if you view it from a perspective of perhaps a grandfather embellishing a story, then you can see why the abnormal tends to happen from time to time and you can really get what's going on.I guess what I'm trying to say, is that sometimes we need to let go of rules and expectations, and let the story be told. A seasoned director such as Anderson does things for a reason, and if you're not getting it, you probably are one of those rigid people I mentioned in my blathering above.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Youthful Joy,"This quirky story about young love is very charming and captures genuine feelings. In order to claim their adoration of each other, these two young people have to escape their tumultuous lives to find happiness. I have to say that I think this is one of Director Wes Anderson's better works. As soon as the film begins, you get a sense that you may be at an independent film festival screening a film that may not have gotten the attention that it deserves. I only saw brief trailers of this film before going to see it, but the reason that I did go was because of its rich cast of characters. I have to first mention the two virtual unknowns who are responsible for playing the lead roles. Kara Hayward (Suzy) and Jared Gilman (Sam) are adorable in their roles. Both characters are pretty much wallflowers and not considered ""normal"" in their world, but function beautifully together. The dedication and loyalty that they display for one another is touching and endearing. Suzy is fearless and gives off the impression that if she puts her mind to it she can accomplish anything. Sam is super intelligent and is just fed up with trying to conform to everyone else's whims. The supporting cast reads like a who's who list. Bruce Willis (Captain Sharp) is the lone police officer in this secluded area of our planet and has the ultimate responsibility of locating our two traveling lovers. Edward Norton (Scout Master Ward) is an over-the-top troop master who runs his young troops like Patton must have run his army. Bill Murray (Walt Bishop) is Suzy's somewhat dysfunctional father who is not only battling with the disappearance of his daughter, but also with a situation that develops with his wife Laura (Frances McDormand). Tilda Swinton (Social Services) along with Harvey Keitel (Commander Pierce) completes this amazing cast. With all the huge blockbusters out this summer it is refreshing to see a film that has a consistent storyline with no big bells and whistles. This off-beat film takes me back to my childhood when there were times that I wanted to escape and exile myself to a Moonrise Kingdom. This film is truly magical and deserves more credit than it is being given. Wes Anderson has brought himself back to form. Finally a film that you don't need 3D glasses to view. I am giving this film a green light.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Do you like Wes Anderson?,"Is probably the only question you should ask yourself before watching this movie. If you like him, you will probably like ""Moonrise Kingdom"", even if it is not his best effort. If you are not into his kind of quirky comedy, better look somewhere else.The story is basic enough: a couple of teenagers fall in love and work out a plan to flee together. And then a lot of Anderson's typical characters try to catch them.Almost all of Anderson's movies kind of center around people running from one place to another, while making deadpan faces and meeting strange people in strange circumstances. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is not the exception, but here he kind of turns the sock inside out by making the story go around a couple of 12-year-old kids and putting them in adults situations. It's like they were doing a school play, as you will have kids playing the couple in love, the antagonist, the colleagues of the guy, who don't like him much and are ordered to catch the fleeing couple... There are some quite funny moments, like the showdown in the middle of the woods. And the young actors raise to the occasion and do a very good job with the material.In that respect, Anderson does a great job, and you will feel for these 12-year-old plight. On the other hand, Anderson doesn't stretch even one millimeter. Have you seen one of his movies? Well, you kind of have watched all, with little variations, and ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is not the exception. On the contrary, take out the teenagers as the center of the story, and it follows his book more than, for example, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". All his trademarks (camera shots, filming of the action, actors (hello grumpy Bill Murray!), etc, appear here).So if you like him, you will love his and his characters antics. But he should try something a little bit more challenging.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Read up on your Bible before seeing this,"Noah and the flood are well played out here, especially where the theme of redemption is involved. Bill Murray plays a real AHole of a lawyer/father, as well as his wife, as they mourn the death of their romance. The daughter is supposedly emotionally disturbed (the mother has a book on the subject, which the daughter steals) but she and the supposedly anti-social boy are the most humane and loving of the whole troupe. You may think you're seeing a revision of ""Lord of the Flies"" for awhile, but the adults prevent that, generally at the last second. Now way is this movie realistic, but we often get the truth in myth. Just to see so many of these great actors play WAAAAAY against type is worth the price ($11.00 at Loew's on Boston Common....too much for a Senior to have to pay). This should get more awards as the year goes by, if the Academy can find any voters with any intelligence and imagination. Although it might have been more dramatic for someone to get killed, I was glad Anderson didn't have to do that. There was drama enough, as it was. Take the kids, and show them what bullying is, AND what someone trying to make up for bullying looks like. Great.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Phantasmagoria of Melancholic Souls,"Moonrise Kingdom is a phantasmagoria populated by melancholic souls, yet Wes Anderson's film is anything but maudlin. He narrates a very original story with a great deal of panache that will keep a grin permanently plastered on your face for 90 odd minutes. The tone is verily set right in the opening sequence which introduces us to the members of the dysfunctional Bishop family. It is a shot embellished with such rich detail that we fail to notice the credits that are pushed out to the edges of the frame.Suzy Bishop, the troubled adolescent with binoculars permanently slung around her neck appears to be engrossed in a book, but is actually waiting to elope with her classmate Sam Shakusky, a cherubic boy-scout, and wise beyond his years in the worldly ways. Their love for each other is comic, almost ridiculous; yet totally believable. How the eloping lovers are hunted down, separated and reunited forms the meat of the film.The locale is an incredibly picturesque island photographed in luscious colours. The story is set in a period when smoking was fashionable and people communicated through telegram. The musical score poignantly evokes that era. The characters leap out at us like those 3D cut-outs from a children's storybook. There is a narrator who intrudes into the story with some prescient messages. The mirth is almost always delivered deadpan. It is a story that ends well, full of hope and you can go home with the cockles of your heart warmed adequately.To label Moonrise Kingdom as a comic fairytale would be too simplistic. The film is liberally strewn with symbols and reading it as a parable would be rewarding, though it might warrant a second viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming and very relatable...,"No Spoilers can be given, so I will try to write the most vaguely possible.There's this island, where two pair - Sam and Suzy - are entangled in a deep trouble related to all in this island.First thing's first, the characters are relatable, since these two characters are very near to me, because my little brother has the same brain problem, and I can imagine him talking those lines back and forth to himself, making these two seem more real. I'm not saying that the other characters aren't charming, they equally are.Second, acting. I would like to compliment the girl Suzy the most, since people with that kind of problem, as I know my little brother, will talk back very directly and their actions would be directly from their heart(the beach) without any second thoughts, and she delivers that well. Also, you have to keep total straight face when you talk, and she did that well too. The other guy is a no-brainer, Bruce Willis. Just having him in a character with authority saying those lines makes the movie a thousand times more legit.Lastly, how it came out. I don't know if you can feel it, but between this couple there is a kind of a charm that stays with them, the way they talk and how much trust and honesty for each other. Also the cinematography made the whole movie looked like children's storybook, which adds up to that charm. Also, it felt weird through the whole movie, but it was made so good it's just the right amount of weird to be really funny.Overall, this is not the greatest cinematic achievement or anything, but it is a very much worth of your time and I really recommend people watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"One of the best ""first love"" ever made.","Wes Anderson is one of today's cinema treasures. His unique visual style, his sensibility and carefully constructed worlds make him a joy to watch.""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a story of a first love, one that take course over the summer of 1965 but could have taken part in any age or place. As most of Anderson's films, the characters are misfits and weirdos, and extremely charming too. The acting is superb, specially for Jared Gilman (Sam) and Kara Hayward (Suzy), two young and really talented actors who make the love story credible every second. Toys, clothing, costumes, coded maps and hideouts are everywhere, enchanting the screen with a vibe of nostalgia. Dysfunctional families and lonely hearts are present too (another common place for Anderson) and it always amazes me how much love feel the director for their characters. A truly, genuine love that never gets compassionate or pitiful. You can feel it in every frame and every line of dialogue. There's an aura of lost innocence, of long and endless summer days when we were young and we thought that every dream could come true.Visually, the film recreates the style of children's books, or the fantasy books Suzy love so much. Symmetry, vivid colors, exquisite compositions of deliberately artificial places are everywhere and we feel dragged right into the heart of a fable or a Doré's engraving. Everyone willing to remember the feeling of that rapturous first love in his/her live should see this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Star-crossed lovers on a New England island,"Moonrise Kingdom (2012) was co-written and directed by Wes Anderson. This quirky, intelligent film doesn't represent reality, but it's a good-natured, funny movie about young love.Things I learned from this film: star-crossed lovers will always capture your attention and demand your affection; Bruce Willis can act when he's not playing a macho jerk; it's fun to see famous actors--Willis, Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, and Frances McDormand--in a movie that gives them a chance to relax and have a good time; the young starring actor, Kara Hayward, is going to go on to great success on Broadway, and probably also in Hollywood.The plot involves young love that is thwarted, Boy Scouts (called ""Khaki Scouts"" in the film), a terrible New England storm, and a married couple--Murray and McDormand--whose marriage has no more love or passion than their legal corporation has.Jared Gilman, who plays the male half of the star-crossed lovers, is a fine young actor who does an excellent job. However, in my mind, Kara Hayward is the actor to watch. Hayward is not drop-dead beautiful (unlike Elizabeth Taylor in ""National Velvet"") but she has a quirky attractiveness combined with real acting talent. She is the next Emma Watson, and I think we'll be watching her on the screen again in the near future.Moonrise Kingdom is an interesting, unusual film that's worth seeing. Don't expect to see a masterpiece, but do expect to be entertained by a charming movie without a boring moment in it.P.S.

Moonrise Kingdom is one of the best!,"Just watched Moonrise Kingdom twice; it's richly stylized and there is a lot to digest both visually and in the layers of meaning Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola have written into the dialogue. I'll likely watch it again because I was even further intrigued by the first two screenings and have really enjoyed the care with which the director recreated the year 1965, even though the depiction of the era was a lot more regimented in the film's tone than it was in real life. But what I really wanted to say (and I don't think it's a spoiler in any way) is that Moonrise Kingdom is about a man. A 12 year old man named Sam. He is the only male in the film who seems to be all there, and who knows what he really wants to be happy. Bruce Willis' character, while in authority as the local sheriff, is at loose ends with himself, his love life, and his dreams of something better in his future. Bill Murray is a lawyer who has become so absent and so fond of the grape that his wife (Fran MsDormand) ceases to love him. Ed Norton, who begins the film as a whip-cracking Scoutmaster, reveals the cracks in his own apparent self-assured-ness as he realizes that the scouts, and Sam in particular, are not just automatons but real children whose deeper needs he is unequipped to handle. And so on. Sam is the only real man, whose maturity and encyclopedic talents have bloomed unnoticed by most of the adults in charge, as well as Sam's fellow scouts, because he has been labeled ""emotionally disturbed"". But by film's end, it is clear that he is indeed the anchor for many of the other characters' unmoored lives. And I was left with the distinct impression that he and his young lady love would be together for the rest of their lives...and have adventures. I wish the movie had been much longer. If it were a book, it would be the kind you put down with a reluctant sigh.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
An exquisitely elegant exercise in nothing ...,"Interestingly enough, it is rather hard to find those capable of being objective towards Wes Anderson. A small but vocal elitist minority is usually unreservedly ecstatic about his movies while the silent majority either has not heard much about them or has readily dismissed them as another pretentiously artistic nonsense.Among many things I find appealing about ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is its overall exquisiteness and elegance – from the impeccable style, to the delicate taste, to the perfection in every small detail.In addition, after watching the movie it becomes pretty obvious that Wes Anderson is a man of a sophisticated taste and a great erudition. I cannot help but admire a director capable of seamlessly and entertainingly wowing into the fabric of the movie references to Benjamin Britten, Henry Purcell as well as to all the four groups of orchestra instruments.And yet, despite all these indisputable fine qualities, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" lacks something critically important, something that turns it into an exquisitely elegant exercise in nothing instead of a great movie.I had spent a long time trying to find a good definition for that elusive quality that I believed ""Moonrise Kingdom"" was lacking until I stumbled upon a great quotation by Edgar Allan Poe: ""Words have no power to impress the mind without the exquisite horror of their reality.""Not only ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is not grounded in the reality, but it is also purposely disconnected from it and decidedly artificial. The imaginary world of ""Moonrise Kingdom"" barely scratches the surface of the vastly complex problems it deceptively pretends to tackle - .Because of that, despite all its admirable perfection, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" still remains an empty, shallow, and ultimately fruitless, although enjoyable movie.And, of course, when I mention shallowness I am not referring to the kind of outrageously glaring shallowness a-la formulaic ""Super 8"" (J.J. Abrams) and some other movies directed or produced by Steven Spielberg himself or by his multiple followers and epigones.The shallowness of ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is quite subtler. With all the enjoyment this beautifully splendid film brings, its lack of internal purpose and full-blooded connection to reality leaves us unsatisfied and disappointed at the end, or, as Edgar Allan Poe wrote, ""fails to impress our mind"".If the admittedly rich content of the movie were somehow distilled to reveal its critical substance, to uncover its heart, all that we would find would be superficial niceties like great shots, beautiful scenery, smooth and smart but lifeless dialogues, imaginative scene sets, but nothing more substantial than that – no real story, no real purpose, nothing that would touch our heart or engage our mind.I already foresee some objections indicating that Wes Anderson is some sort of a uniquely creative genius with an unconventional vision that should not be a subject to common judgment.I am wondering, however, what a true value of that supposedly unique vision is if the only fruit it bears is a well-disguised nothing in a colorful packaging so enticing for the small group of the divorced from reality intellectuals.There are many great directors with a unique vision. Their masterpieces are complex, multidimensional, and inexpressibly deep interpretations of the real world around us.Their movies provoke in us agonizing thoughts, make us strongly empathize with the characters, and ultimately leave us horrified by the yawning chasm of the human existence, miraculously grasped by a genius.""Moonrise Kingdom"" does not possess any of that. Its exceptionally well though-out, brilliantly directed story with beautiful music unfortunately represents a mere shell for an improbable and superficial fairy tale.What the movie can pride itself on, however, is the all-star cast featuring Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Bruce Willis in an uncharacteristic, but surprisingly good performance.Among the other noteworthy performances in the film are the cute teenage ""lovebirds"" Sam Shakusky played by Jared Gilman and Suzy Bishop played by Kara Hayward Their believable acting and good screen chemistry seem to be vastly superior to those of the overall unconvincing duo (Asa Butterfield and Chloë Grace Moretz) from the Martin Scorsese's bland ""Hugo"".""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a perfectly made, charming niche movie meant to be slowly savored by the relatively small group of genre enthusiasts. What prevents it from becoming a truly great movie is being not moving enough to speak to our hearts and not thought-provoking enough to occupy our minds.knowyourmovie.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Puppy Unlove,"This film is recommended."" And they called it puppy love, Just because we're in our teens Tell them all it isn't fair, To take away my only dream. ""Lyrics by Paul Anka's Puppy LoveThe year is 1965. Sam ( Jared Gilman ) and Susie ( Kara Hayward ) have fallen in love. These teenagers want to desperately escape from the harsh realities of our adult world. So they form a secret pact and run away from all of the conformity, rules, and regulations that can easily complicate a child's life. Down with authority or any sense of order. It's freedom that this loners are after. But it is their very actions that create a domino effect of events that impact the complacency of a tiny New England community. This once peaceable kingdom slowly becomes unhinged in Wes Anderson's nostalgic whimsy of a film, Moonrise Kingdom.Wes Anderson has assembled a stock troupe of eccentric actors to play his stock collection of eccentric characters. This group of indie favorites includes the stalwart Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, with Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Harvey Keitel and Tilda Swinton newly added to his repertoire of quirky performers this time around. They bring their zany characters to life.The end result is a diverting rehash of Anderson's highly personal themes and style: his ongoing search for lost childhood innocence and its stark divergence from reality; his somewhat surreal take on the world as it once was; his contrasting color palette brimming over with visual razzle-dazzle; his off-balanced sense of irony and humor. All of his trademarks are there as he playfully toys with his characters and their dilemmas. ( The director seems to be somewhat inspired by Truffaut's film, Breathless, but with a more comic and quaint tone, as these young fugitive lovers try to escape from society with their 45's, children's books, and binoculars in tow. )While Anderson has a knack for capturing the joys and frustrations of adolescence and he thoroughly defines the awkwardness and simplicity of first love in his solid direction and humorous script ( with Roman Coppola as co-writer ), the director makes a few missteps along the way when he introduces some unnecessary violent images and an episode with the Schwartman's character that makes no logical sense. This takes the film on an absurd detour that almost deflates its satirical edginess. These scenes transports Moonrise Kingdom into the realm of stark reality which the film tries to avoid at all costs and ""seriously"" undercut the upbeat and carefree mood and message that worked so effortlessly within most of the film.The young leads are perfectly cast as the misunderstood outcasts and their underage antics have all the more charm due to the natural performances that Anderson brings to the screen. Other factors that aid in the film's success are the surreal photography by Robert D. Yeoman which immediately shows the departmentalizing of its characters and their surroundings with its doll-house fascination of Susie's home, the humorous touches in the costumes by Kasia Walicka-Maimone ( loved the scout uniforms' detailing ), and the eclectic musical score by Alexandre Desplat, with assists from Benjamin Britton and Hank Williams.The film is, without question, a decidedly quirky film that relishes in its own bizarre tendencies, and for the most part, entertains with its outlandish and idiosyncratic distinctiveness. Anderson's imaginative vision offers much to admire. Like the film's many odd characters, Moonrise Kingdom's originality and wholehearted uniqueness make for a satisfying movie-going experience and ultimately cajoles its audience into believing, once again, in the joys of childhood innocence and the power of puppy love.

Wes Anderson brings us another odd and quirky comedy masterpiece.,"'MOONRISE KINGDOM': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Wes Anderson brings us another odd and quirky comedy masterpiece, this one is sort of a 'Romeo & Juliet' style love story. It tells the tale of two twelve-year-old outcasts in love who run away from their New England town and cause a search party. Anderson directed the film as well as co-wrote it with Roman Coppola (who also wrote 'THE DARJEELING LIMITED' with him). It stars two impressive young newcomers as well as vets Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel. The movie has all of Anderson's usual touches and flavor and I thought this was actually one of his better works.The film is set on a New England island in 1965 and revolves around two young lovers named Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward). Both are misfits: Sam is an orphan who was the least popular member of his scout camp and Suzy despises her dysfunctional family. The two met at a church play the previous summer and had remained pen pals for an entire year before deciding to run away together the following summer. They run in to the forest in search of a special cove where they plan to spend the rest of their days together. Suzy's parents (Murray and McDormand), along with the Scout Ward (Norton) and local police Captain (Willis), begin a search party for them.The movie is all about the innocence of youth and what despair it sometimes causes them to look forward to the adult lives their parents and other influences represent for them (often kids have their acts together much better than adults do, as age often corrupts). It's also about love and adoration as well as being a social outcast, especially at a young age. Anderson delivers these messages beautifully (with his quirky touch) and the music by Alexandre Desplat is breathtakingly fitting. Often I find Anderson's work just a little too abstract for me to fully relate to but other than that his pictures are nearly perfect. I see this film the same way, although I'd place it a little higher than his previous few efforts. Still it doesn't live up to 'BOTTLE ROCKET' or 'ROYAL TENENBAUMS', which are my favorites of his.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOMEqlGt6m4",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The 16mm quality, the saturated warm colors and the 1960s retro props are really stunning and beautiful. the actors are not standardly pretty, they have interesting faces. the camp setting was so nostalgic and really conveyed the feeling of a memory of a childhood.2. good acting. there is no overacting here. the kids were fantastic and so real. the casting of the stars was perfect from Bruce Willis to Tilda Swinton.3. great story. it bordered on the surreal and had that quality of a fairytale - where not everything is realistic and it doesn't really matter because it's a movie and anything can happen. it was a deep story about the human character - sinister, complex and innocent at the same time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Moonrise is a terrific Wes Anderson movie that manages to be intelligent, funny, and full of quirks all at the same time.","Over the course of the last decade writer/director/producer Wes Anderson has successfully carved out a very successful little niche for himself in the fused genre of dramedy. Anderson has a very distinct style with his dry(but not British dry) humor, quirky characters, and very stylized settings. Moonrise Kingdom is his latest film which he takes on a childhood romance set in the 1960s on an island somewhere in New England. Does this movie deliver on the laughs, or does Anderson's style get in the way of this seemingly simple take on a child romance?Moonrise Kingdom is a story about an orphan in 1960s New England named Sam Shakusky(Jared Gilman) who runs away from his Khaki scout camp to meet with who he believes is the love of his life, Suzy Bishop(Kara Hayward).Read the full review: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-cy",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Maybe I'm alone on this...,"Am I the only one that didn't think Moonrise Kingdom was THAT good? I'm confused by its 8/10 rating in comparison to Wes' superior films. I watched it with someone else who also typically enjoys Wes' films, but we both felt the same way afterward.It was alright, but to me, by far my LEAST favorite Wes Anderson film. I think Wes is just at that point in his career where he has such a cult (hipster) following (and no I am not void of this) that they'll eat up anything he does, even if it's crap.Moonrise had good dialogue and artistic cinematography as usual, and Bill Murray, though his screen time was short,was the best part of the film but there was most definitely some shaky/careless film-making especially towards the end. I'm sure it was purposeful in some way, but it wasn't effective, at least to me. And the plot was just bizarre, not that his other films aren't either. I GET IT. Coming of age and all that, it has been done before. (I'd much prefer Stand By Me or something) but at times I seriously felt like I was watching kiddie porn.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simplicity and innocence,"Wes Anderson has put together a piece of pie that is exquisitely prepared and uniquely sliced, a signature piece that he seems to be dishing out a personality all of its own. Charming and stylish, laced with humor and irony, populated with archetypal characters that in the end break their mold and become in some ways reborn, this film cannot be watched with any preconceived perceptions of the story. And if you do go for a viewing, these preconceptions will be a waste of time.The film exhibits more as a stage show with an incredibly elaborate set than an on-site filming; location is just an added bonus (amazing wilderness of Rhode Island). The simplicity of the filming is its strong point, void of the special effects that have dominated the summer blockbuster season, even the disaster sequences though cheesy are enjoyable almost in the same vain as Godzilla. You have to overlook the flaws in order to get to the wonderful story.First and foremost, this is a love story. We could say it might be a coming of age, but when you have been immersed in the film you realize no one is really acting their age, which I found hilarious. The movie pokes fun at the establishment, then ports it to a time when hypocrisy and fundamental truth lay in the same bed.Set on an island that is being monitored by a meteorologist, you have small town residents, a camp of scouts, local law, big government and ageless innocence, the cast is literally a sky of super and newly discovered stars. Bruce Willis is the local law (surprised?), Edward Norton a cigarette smoking whiskey drinking troop leader, Bill Murray and Frances McDormand play parents; then we have a legion of relatively unknown newcomers that play the scouts. The focus of the movie surrounds two typically (by today's standards) alienated children (Brilliantly played by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward), who have pledged their love for each other by meeting in a field and running off together.There is not a huge effort to play up emotional content, but it does focus on bonding, devotion and individual freedom that was prevalent in 1965. MPAA rated this PG13 for a simple underwear scene, but I guess some over-reactive parent would probably agree it was not suitable. Wes penned the story, teaming up with his friend from The Darjeeling Limited Roman Coppola. It is paced well and though I can't guarantee it, should keep your attention. You need to pay attention. There is much to gain from it.The wrap-up was not all that surprising. It is more similar to putting out the lights just before you go to bed. It will influence your sleep. It should make you smile. The local theater was to capacity, and just like a meal that was carefully prepared, people savored the delicate flavors silently with a few grunts of approval. When the ending credits started to roll, it was met with nearly a standing ovation.Having taught kindergarten for a while, I found that I would spend hours working something complex into a completely simple presentation. If done correctly everyone is pulled into the moment. This was one of those moments.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
enjoyable but ultimately overdoses on quirkiness,"Highly original in both concept and style -as is customary with a Wes Anderson production - ""Moonrise Kingdom"" nevertheless proves that, even in the most skillful of hands, a little quirkiness can go a long way.Set in 1965, this surrealistic indie comedy focuses on two misfit children - one a twelve-year-old orphan and the other the daughter of two whacked-out parents - who run off to a remote New England island so they can live in isolation with one another, right as a hurricane is about to hit the area.The talented Jared Gilman and Kara Haywood play the two social outcasts, while the adults are portrayed by Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman and Harvey Keitel as an assortment of parents, troop leaders, detectives and social services officials. The irony is that most of the adults turn out to be even more bizarre and dysfunctional than the children who've run away because they just don't fit in.Co-written by Roman Coppola and Wes Anderson and directed by Anderson, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is overflowing with wit, striking imagery and on-the- mark deadpan performances. But the archness does get to be a bit much at times, and the atonal, emotionless line readings eventually take their toll on the audience.It's a clever and likable enough little trifle that, even at a relatively brief 94-minute running time, winds up overstaying its welcome. But the critics sure seem to love it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Quirky, consistently unreal, and slightly dark: more enjoyable than I expected","I'm not a Wes Anderson fan, but I don't especially dislike him. The only other of his movies I've seen is The Royal Tenenbaums, and I didn't much like it but don't much remember it either. So I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to.It's quirky and sort of dark, which I like, and it has a consistent tone of unreality all the way through, which I also like. I'd gotten the idea that the Wilson brothers (Owen, et al) are closely bound up with Anderson, so I was relieved not to see any of them here because I can't stand any of them.But I didn't mind some actors whom I usually can't stand (Tilda Swinton and Bill Murray), I liked one I always like (Frances McDormand), and I was indifferent to the rest, to whom I'm generally indifferent (Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel, Edward Norton, Jason Schwartzman, etc). The kids were okay but nothing exceptional.I don't see what in this movie freaked out the people who were freaked out by it, unless it was the sex play between the kids; but heterosexual sex always disgusts me so this was no different. Overall, a movie I enjoyed more than I expected to but probably won't ever watch again.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Enjoy falling into another Wes Anderson fairy tale world this time with runaways, a 45 rpm record player, and a character named Social Services","If the director's name was omitted from the opening credits, you would still know exactly who created Moonrise Kingdom. Wes Anderson's style is so familiar to his fans they would be able to pick out his sixth film anywhere. The character close-ups with them staring directly into the camera are here. The short, simple and declarative sentences are here. Of course, Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman are here; however, those two are the extent of the usual Wes Anderson film players involved in his latest. There is also the whimsical plot, an omniscient narrator, and a character named Social Services.Moonrise focuses on two 12 year olds, Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward). They consider themselves misunderstood and find kindred spirits in one another on a small and isolated New England island in 1965. Sam is in a Khaki Scout troop run under the detailed eye of Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). Suzy is an island native being raised by her lawyer parents, Walt (Murray) and Laura (Frances McDormand), who call each other counselor during conversations. Sam and Suzy follow through on their idea to run away together and are quickly pursued by Suzy's parents, Scout Master Ward, and Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), who appears to be the lone policeman on the island.Sam and Suzy make a good pair. He has absorbed excellent camping and nature skills from the Khaki Scouts and Suzy, after getting tired of feeling like the black sheep of her family, relishes the fact that she is not alone in the world. Sam has been alone a long time. He is an orphan who does not fit in anywhere and is now also pursued by Social Services (Tilda Swinton). These two 12 year olds spend a lot of time in front of the camera together and thankfully pull it off. Moonrise Kingdom would have been in big trouble if Wes Anderson had not found capable kids to fill these shoes.The adults take on supporting roles either as parents who just don't understand or confused authority figures who cannot figure out why their charges would ever want to run away. Captain Sharp is tired and lonely, the Bishop parents are growing apart (which is not helped by Laura's frequent bullhorn announcements), and Scout Master Ward thought he was running a tight ship of scouts before the run away. He is starkly confused on why anyone would ever want to leave the scouts, even if they are the most unpopular one in the group.The actual run away escapades, the ensuing search parties, and the developing relationship between Sam and Suzy are best left for the audience to watch and discover rather than read about it in a review. Notable supporting characters pop up now and then which will cause audience members in the know to smile. The most enjoyable part of the film though is Wes Anderson's familiar atmosphere. There are not too many films whose world you wouldn't mind drifting off into. Plenty of people would raise their hands to jump into a Wes Anderson world, be it in such previous efforts as Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, and now Moonrise Kingdom.Robert Yeoman has been the director of photography on all six Wes Anderson films and the audience can see it immediately. The long, panning shots, the in your face close-ups, and the ever so slight fairy tale feeling are all trademarks of his style and camera work. The script is up to Rushmore and Royal Tenenbaums standards and thankfully surpasses the lesser efforts of The Life Aquatic and The Darjeeling Limited. Co-written with Roman Coppola, the dialogue is what you expect from Wes Anderson and the scenes with the 12 years olds are spectacularly written. These are not just children, perhaps under-sized adults is a more suitable term.Thank goodness for Wes Anderson. Without him, the cinema would be a far less interesting place to go to. His peer group includes the Coen Brothers, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Cameron Crowe. Together, that list makes a formidable effort to educate movie-goers about what true films are capable of and continue to push back against the mundane garbage you usually are served from the likes of Michael Bay and Adam Sandler.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Young, yellow love finding happiness in the world of Wes Anderson","Like all Wes Anderson films, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" has its own specific colour palette. This time it's yellow. Yellow can symbolize wisdom, joy and happiness but also the conflicting traits of cowardice, loneliness and deceit. All of which can be found in the characters that inhabit this world. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" takes place in the 1960s on a remote island of New England, but I'm pretty sure it's set in a time and place that doesn't exist and never has.The opening, establishing shots were quick and strange making sure that you had no idea what you were getting yourself into. Beautiful American homes standing alone on rocky cliffs and a handful of characters looking alone and out of place. But of course during this time I was focusing on the opening credits and discovered a delightful mix of actors.Edward Norton (whom we welcome back to the quirky comedy genre) plays the Scout Master Ward of a small group of boy Khaki Scouts, dressed of course in khaki. The movie starts when he discovers that one such boy has zipped his tent up from the inside and escaped through a hole covered up by a map. Sam, we discover, was a troubled kid, disliked by everybody. When his foster father is informed of the incident, he informs us that Sam is not welcome back home, at this time.Norton instructs the Khaki Scouts to find Sam and bring him back. But these boys are armed and dangerous. Carrying guns, knives, clubs and axes, they don't like Sam. Norton also calls the local police captain, Bruce Willis (whom we enthusiastically welcome to quirky comedy genre). At around this time, Bill Murray (of course) and Frances McDormand discover that their daughter Suzy is also missing. Suzy discovered a pamphlet on ""Coping with the very troubled child"" that her parents put on top of the refrigerator, and she has run away.This is when this clever, comedic and quirky film really came into its own for me. We have a pair of smart, troubled, independent and lonely preadolescents on the run together. And the genre that ""Moonrise Kingdom"" belongs to finally became clear: it's a simple, coming-of-age comedy about puppy love. As unnatural as everything seems at times, all the while being set in nature, Anderson's depiction of preadolescent love was the most realistic interpretation I have ever seen.Sam and Suzy are played by Kara Haywood and Jared Gilman (reverse respectively) making their feature film and Wes Anderson film debuts. And they couldn't have been better, fitting right into the eccentric landscape. An almost unstoppable duo, Sam and Suzy send the local inhabitants on even more search parties and disastrous adventures determined to find a place where they and everyone around them can find happiness. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is that place with remarkable stylistic imagery.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hk Auteur Review - Moonrise Kingdom,"A pair of young lovers flee their New England town, which causes a local search party to fan out and find them.The film has a strong ensemble cast. The two leads Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward carry the film just fine. I believed their romance, connected with their loneliness and rooted for them. It's been a while since Bruce Willis played a character. In America they call it character acting; the rest of the world just calls it acting. Don't ask me why. But it was refreshing to see Willis play someone who functions at a lower volume compared to his larger-than-life tough guy action roles. It was also nice to see Edward Norton doing comedy and playing a klutzier character as well.Perhaps my favorite thing about Moonrise Kingdom was its storybook aesthetic, which acts as the engine pumping a vibrant energy through the story. To list a few examples, the story is set in an enclosed world. A narrator delivers story information straight to the camera in a vocal tone that sounds like he's instructing a child on how to use a toaster. The cinematography, with its camera movements, deliberately flattens the framing, subtly embodying the two-dimensional quality of a children's storybook panel.I liked the world that was created in the film. It was believable and at the same time contained a fairy-tale-like quality and a sense of wonder. As the two lead characters were trying to escape their home like a cartoon character trying to run out of the edges of a page, I could not have imagined what the outside world would have looked like. The world was just that well established. For example, product placement would have completely shattered the illusion of the world. Not that I was specifically looking for it, but I'm glad I do not recall any in the film.There is a real sense of a community that's attached to this place and I like that even the smaller characters all contribute to the action of the story rather than acting as mere background decoration. And for that, the characters earn their quirks.The only other Wes Anderson work I have seen was The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou. So I maybe unqualified to say this, but Moonrise Kingdom is probably the most accessible Wes Anderson film. The film is rated PG-13, but I do believe that the film will play well to children (from 9-10 onwards, it does have a few dark moments), particularly as a way to reach children who have been orphaned or have experienced a broken family. It feels as though Wes Anderson made this movie for them.I was entranced, laughed and it put me in a fuzzy warm mood by the end. Moonrise Kingdom proves how simple stories can still be powerful and it does not take complex story structures to engage and move an audience.For more reviews, please visit my blog at http://hkauteur.wordpress.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Deadpan Delight,"There is nothing ordinary about a Wes Anderson Movie.

"The always funny and amusing quirky, whimsical Wes Anderson has made some great films, but he's never produced such a beautiful and sweet story until now.","I find Moonrise Kingdom to be the most polished Wes Anderson film to date. While it includes the norms of a Wes Anderson feature – vibrantly colorful cinematography, quirky dialog, spontaneity, Bill Murray – the heart of this movie is unlike anything I've ever seen from him.It's an adventure tale about two young lovers by the names of Sam and Suzy who in their innocence, decide to run away together, leaving havoc among the adult characters, played by the likes of Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, Francis McDormand, and the aforementioned Bill Murray. The adult character's troublesome lives and inadvertent personalities are confronted in the midst of the chaotic search for the children. In contrast, Sam and Suzy's bond becomes even more intimate as they discuss the troubles and turbulences of youth. However, things are bound to get twisted and soon we're in for a wildly hilarious adventure.Despite all the great actors featured in the ensemble cast, the most memorable performances come from the two young unknown actors playing Sam and Suzy. They enable the spirits of their characters so well, I can't imagine writers Anderson and Roman Coppola envisioning them to be any better. While I've always found Anderson's troublesome characters to be intriguing, I've never felt the sympathy for them that I felt for Sam and Suzy. As a result, Moonrise Kingdom is the most universal, affective story Wes Anderson has told.If you had to describe this film in one word, there would be so many options. The obvious ones that come up are witty, whimsical, and clever. Going into the theater though, I did not expect that the film would be so sweet and beautiful. Beautiful in both its imagery and its surprisingly graceful storytelling. With all the hoopla that comes from Anderson's wonderful gimmicks, he still manages to balance style with substance and leave us with more than just a few laughs.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Look at me. I have a STYLE! A-cloying we will go. A-cloying we will go.,"Heigh-ho ... a-cloying we will go.It has the same style as all WA's films. It is probably above average for a WA film, far better than ""The Life Aquatic"", for example, but I can't be bothered to decide if it WA's best. WA's ""best"" are only so good, since they all suffer from the over-reliance on ""style"". The visual part of WA's style is what make me bother trying to watch his films. The other parts of his ""style"" is why I seldom finish watching a WA film. The talk strangely, walk strangely, even stand strangely, use a lack of emotion to supposedly show emotion are just too much past about an hour, even in the best of WA's films.The two kids act like they can't act, but so do the adults, so who knows.

Let's get quirky!,"So let's get some quirky actors - Bill Murray, Ed Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, etc. - and put them in a quirky situation with boy scouts on a small island and then have a quirky narrator kind of tell us what's going to happen even though narrators usually tell us what did happen. Wouldn't that be totally quirky! In the quirkly named ""Moonrise Kingdom"" Wes Anderson tries to pull the ""New Girl"" television show's audience out of cute apartments and out to the flicks. There they find that the film presents some interesting dialog and plot turns as well as some decent performances particularly by the child actors. However, these charms are wrapped in circumstances somewhat over- engineered to be offbeat. The feeling of being manipulated limits the audience from fully enjoying the film although given the story can't fully sustain interest over its full length limits how much there is to enjoy. Also limiting the enjoyment are some highly uncomfortable scenes involving a twelve year old character being felt up in her underwear. People who find this discomforting (and everyone should feel uncomfortable with it) should avoid the film. In short, if M. Night Shayamalan didn't exist, Anderson would have an argument for being rated modern U.S. cinema's most overrated director.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Growing up Wes Anderson style,"Wes Anderson movies seem to play in a parallel universe, where everything seems to be slightly off. But in a good way that is. While it might seem he is interpreting his childhood years (in most of his movies), whatever it is he does, he does so in a very unique style. From the sets to the story to the dialog.Our main characters here are kids. And the romance between them is pure, which is quite a task. I can imagine that still some people might find a few scenes awkward, but that would be their interpretation and nothing Anderson was aiming for. It's almost fairy tale like, with some crazy characters thrown into it. The kids making more sense than the grown-ups most of the time. Beautiful movie, that even cynics will find difficult to dismiss.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The innocence and inexperience of young love,"One of my all-time favourite films is 'Melody' (1971, aka S.W.A.L.K.), and although it's a very different film, when I stumbled upon Moonrise Kingdom I was struck by a number of similarities. Moonrise Kingdom features Sam, a Boy Scout who falls in love at first sight with fellow 12 year-old Suzy, in the context of a musical theatre production. In Melody, 10 year-old Boys' Brigade member Daniel is equally stricken by Melody Perkins on spotting her in her school ballet class. The scene where Suzy's mother tries to sympathise with her daughter's heartache echoes that in which Melody's parents try to reason with her, and Suzy's poignant remark, 'We're in love. We just want to be together – what's wrong with that?' recall's Daniel's cry of 'All we want to do is be with one another all the time.' In both films the young couples run away together and undergo a 'marriage' ceremony aided and abetted by their peers, and other common factors are dysfunctional backgrounds and the conflict between youth and authority. There is also a strong musical element: Melody has songs by the Bee Gees, whereas Benjamin Britten, Hank Williams, Françoise Hardy and others provide the background for Moonrise Kingdom. Sam and Suzy (portrayed superbly by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) are two years older and that much more mature than Danny and Melody, and this is reflected in the storyline. The general tenor is more quirky and the humour more subtle and deadpan, but Moonrise Kingdom has instantly appealed to me and found a well-deserved place among my best-loved films.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Creative story,"Moonrise Kingdom is a good film. Not great but a good one. I watched only film made by director Wes Anderson previously and it was Darjeeling Limited back in 2007, a good film, recommended, but I am not at all familiar with his style of work. Now, talking about that film, I want to say there is something peculiar about Moonrise Kingdom, firstly the eccentricity of the characters. They're not conventional in any way, and the acting make them looks even more like caricatures. And I didn't like it, in fact, despite the cast being full of great and known names, like Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray and even a few cameos of also known actors, but the truth is that character-wise(if that makes sense), I don't liked it at all. The acting was weak, in other words. But what drew my attention in fact, was the story. Not only because it's weird, but it's also because this is one of the rarest films that you can tell that the characters don't makes the story, but the story makes the characters. It's crazy. I also was impressed with the loads of symbiotic elements on it and notably a harsh critic against the world. There are unusual scenes of violence and some sexuality between the teens that you mostly don't see in films of the genre, is not trivialized, but still shocking from what the film seems to be. I also thought that the cinematography had some kind of 'nostalgic' feeling. You know, some of the manual zooms and the angles of some scenes resembles the films from the 70s, a decade where was common the use of this technique. I think it's one of the greatest films from 2012, so it's worth watching. It's not great, but worth your time and even a re-watch. 8.1/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fantastic!,Fantastic! But it lacks something that gives me that wow feeling needed to make it truly outstanding. Still this is quite an experience to say the least. Director Wes Anderson not only creates a great story with moving pictures but he also paints us a cinematic portrait worthy of hanging on the walls of an art museum. The colors and framing of so many shots are a visual wonder that encaptured me and held me in a state of awe time and time again. The story is almost secondary to the camera's work of enticing you into it's grip. Just an absolutely wonderful film that I look forward to returning to sometime soon!--A Kat Pirate Screener,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Epic"" children's play","After watching this movie, I feel like I've actually been in a theater. Watcing a children's play. Weird.This is definitely something new to me, I've never watched a movie quite like this. The plot itself could have been displayed in a regular way, but then this movie wouldn't have been as special, would it? If this was just another drama about two adolescent runaways, misunderstood and neglected by the adults, and the consequent search party, it would have been just another movie we have already seen. And it would probably get good enough reviews anyway, at least because of its great cast. But instead, Wes Anderson and Roman Coppola decided to go in a slightly different direction. And I wouldn't expect anything else from them, anyway.At first part of the movie, I must be honest, this irritated me quite a bit. That's probably because I'm not used to watching movies filmed this way. Furthermore, it's not just that the movie was filmed like it was a children's play, but it was also filmed as seen through children's eyes, so it basically pushes the viewer to adapt to thinking like a child. Although it has its adult moments, flirting with themes such as love, romanticism, even sexuality (in a clumsy, childish manner), but also ""darker"" themes such as child negligence, adultery, hurting (both physical and psychical) and death. There is also a slight touch of dark humor in some scenes.One thing that I didn't like in this movie is the music - it's too loud, too quirky, and in my opinion there's just too much of it. I would have rather that they skipped a few numbers, and left some scenes silent, just with the conversation of the characters. But, I guess the music was done like this on purpose, so to create the theatrical atmosphere, and to be in tone with the rich and colorful stage scenery, and emphasize the ""epicness"" of the plot.All in all, this movie left me a bit confused. I'm not sure whether to like it or not. It's definitely not my genre, but then again, this is something I'm not used to, and it's kind of hard to say if it's my genre or not, since I can't even label this movie with a genre, I'm not sure of its genre. One thing I do know, and that is I am not a theater guy myself, but I think this movie would be very interesting to anyone who likes the theater. And also to anyone who is open to something new, equipped with a little patience, and appreciates artistic freedom - I say, thumbs up!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Simple, while being complex","Moonrise Kingdom is not a laugh out loud film, but it may still make you smile, nor is a very dramatic one, though it just might make you feel.Like most of Wes Anderson's work, the cinematography is very unconventional while original. Although the cast is star-powered (and very worthy of the name) the attention is mostly focused on the Sam/Suzy relationship and their Huckleberry Finn-like adventure. The film manages to make us remember the pains and beauty of growing up while feeling we sometimes don't belong. The music is also very interesting (as we come to expect from Wes Anderson) and fits very well with the movie.While I do not believe this movie is right for everyone, I hope you will come to enjoy the complexity of this simple looking piece of work.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonrise Kingdom,"Moonrise Kingdom, going in with somewhat high expectations having seen a fair bit of WA's work I've been looking forward to watching another one of his films. This one surely hits it's mark stylistically and is filled to the bring with details. Overall it's a really strong, unique, coming of age story, but for me it lacked a bit of focus, and character depth that elevated many of his previous works.Directing, initially, the opening scene sets this movie up as a sort of Royal Tenenbaums thing, but it quickly jumps away from that. Not that I don't love the dollhouse style intro WA's excels at. But it felt too focused on the bigger story and broader set of characters involved. Besides that, I love WA's style, there's nothing else like it, it's quirks and stunning cinematography haven't failed to bore me. Compositions and set design shine in this and really show the creative direction at work.Writing, story, I liked the story, just liked. But for me, the main leads were not the dynamic nor the acting powerhouses that were able to carry so much of the movie, and it ends up faltering a bit here and there. The writing moves a bit quick, and the continuity error in the lighting strike scene is odd, either way, communicated poorly. In general I think the VFX work is not the most convincing here and could've been done more stylistically or without. Dialog is great, the side character scenes are really the ones that shined for me. For instance the phone call with Social Services with a fantastic performance from Swinton, so good.Music, fantastic, applicable and light hearted fitting to the tone of the whole movie. With a decent motief. And some great background songs chosen, fitting perfectly to some scenes.So yeah, I didn't fall in love with this as much as others. I'd gladly take Darjeeling Limited over this just because it packs a much better story in there even though it might be a bit rougher in other departments.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wes Anderson's most heartwarming picture,"Given its highly fanciful aura and bizarrely original storyline, Moonrise Kingdom is arguably the most charming and expressive film directed by Wes Anderson. This visually stunning picture casts an enchanting spell on the viewer, pulling him deep into the picturesque universe where even the seemingly insignificant events are the key to a happy ending. Wes Anderson applies the usual palette of extraordinarily vivid color compositions, making this eccentric rom-com drama look more like a dream-based sequence, explained by a highly creative child.The viewer gets acquainted with the setting of the picture through a short yet insightful introduction made by an unidentified man in a quirky red hat (a homage to The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou): this is the island of New Penzance, and the year is 1965. The film follows closely the adventures of two teenagers, Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward), as they embark on a journey, which might seem like a sort of a desired rebirth for them, but ultimately brings chaos into the lives of all the adults that take part in the story. The two main characters, deeply in love with each other, long for solitude, somewhere far away from all the real-life problems that made their lives truly miserable. Sam is a socially awkward, orphaned 'Khaki Scout', and Suzy is a depressed girl who strikes as a totally unemotional figure, but through her behavior it's actually easy to register what goes on in her mind. Love is what brought them together some time ago, and love is what made them consider running away from homes as the means to fulfillment. Unfortunately, this drastic decision disturbed the idyllic society of New Penzance, causing an island-long search carried out by a bunch of radically unbalanced people. There's Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton), police captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), Suzy's parents Walt (Bill Murray) and Laura (Frances McDormand) among others. In the midst of this ridiculous investigation, all the adults actually expose their own grand problems in the process. The dialogues between them are as sharp and angry, as they are actually sophisticated to say the least. What's crucial to say about them is that a minor alteration of the daily routine uncovers their fears and hidden desires, ironically making look them even more childish than the younger characters in the film.Wes Anderson made a great use of his well-known cast. Every actor has his or her specific role in the whole intrigue, but the greatness of those many performances can be really seen only when all of the characters come together. They're like the smaller pieces of a bigger, wholehearted and whimsical puzzle.By applying various camera techniques Wes Anderson gave some of the scenes in the picture a nifty stage play-esque touch. The atmosphere, the colors, the old-school filters, and the on- location shots, reveal the film's strange, but somehow familiar, 60's vibe.There's a lot of awkwardness in the film, but this is really what makes it so enjoyable and satisfying. Being a noteworthy addition to the comedy genre, Moonrise Kingdom aspires to be the most imaginative film of the year. Wes Anderson's stylish exploration of young love is a satisfying one, and apart from applying a lot of his typical quirk and whimsy, the director shows that he matured and put a lot of his own heart into the project.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wes Anderson at his most sincere,"Moonrise Kingdom is a heartwarming story of young love and finding your place that represents Wes Anderson at his most sincere. It's intimate and moving yet still has some grander moments in the third act and reaffirms how good Anderson is with pacing as this is once again all done in 90 minutes.All the child actors here are incredibly impressive, obviously Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward are the best as the leads. Wes Anderson's writing and offbeat pace are not easy to get right in terms of timing and delivery but every child actor here absolutely nails it.The adult cast is a fair few of the loveable Anderson regulars and some destined to become them but Bruce Willis is by far the strongest. It's a reminder of what he's truly capable of with a quieter presence that never feels like he's phoning it in.Wes Anderson's direction remains as visually satisfying as ever, every frame is as masterfully crafted and striking as expected, offering both some of his most vibrant and stark imagery. Alexandre Desplat's score is delightfully twee throughout.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Somewhat compelling,"(2012) Moonrise Kingdom
ADVENTURE/ FANTASY""A tree house standing on top of a thin tall little tree"", ""a child struck by lightening and then acting like it's no big deal"" and ""two children hiking along the woods miles and miles by themselves even though they're walking along a trail"" or 'boy scouts talking in tones like they're part of an army' - these are some of the things you could be expecting while watching the wacky world developed from the mind of Wes Anderson who co-wrote and directed ""Monnrise Kingdom"", which upon watching this film is like re-living an old children's book parents used to read to you when you were a child. At first it appears to look like an innocent movie about a child who feels like an outcast, who runs away while adults are looking for him, but as the film progresses, it becomes a little more complicated than that as he's running away with a girl companion he's attracted to and acting like it's no big deal except that they're both outcasts. The two runaways are Sam Shatusky (Jared Gilman) and Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward), and in this unique world their journey is like an imaginary picture book full of pictures but as soon as they remain side by side with one another, Wes the director transitioned their little love story to a young teen novel. The other eccentric characters are also strangely compelling too because they consist of actors we recognize, but have never seen them playing those type of characters before, such as Bruce Willis playing one of the boy scout masters, Frances McDormand playing the mother of the girl, Harvey Keitel playing top scout master and Edward Norton playing a second-in-command, and a small role for Tilda Swinton as a lady working for Social Services. It's feel is similar to a play acting kind of movie but in a make believe environment. This is not exactly my cup of tea but is still compelling to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A work of art, not a ""child's erotic movie"" - you missed the point.","I saw this movie last night, not really enjoying Wes Craven's previous movies, but enjoyed it so much I thought it would get really positive reviews (it had very positive reviews on our Oz film review program on public television). Instead there are a plethora of negative reviews saying how forgettable it was, how pretentious Wes Craven is, and suggesting kiddie porn! This was a beautiful, innocent idyll of 12 year- old children and their perceptions of the adult world. More than that, if cinema is an amalgam of screenplay, acting, visual composition, music and magic, then this succeeded brilliantly. It felt more like a European movie than American, with strong elements of surrealism, beautifully existential questioning of adult mores as seen by 12-year-olds, and the superb use of colour and composition. The music, especially the music of one of the greatest 20th century British composers Benjamin Britten, was superb and very clever. I think it is amazing that US culture can nitpick over joyfully innocent young sex, while supporting the kiddie porn of young girls in 'beauty quests', not to mention a society that accepts guns when young children are being blown away by gun-toting maniacs. Can you see what the rest of the world sees as an amazing hypocrisy? I will highly recommend this surreal, innocent, creative, intelligent, and beautifully crafted movie to the rest of the world as an example of the best of US counter-culture.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful, Thoughtful, and Fun","I think this is like a good work of an artist. The film conveys a serious message through children love story and facts about landscape and weather. It's like an art film yet it is not too complicated to understand. There are many funny moments as well, so overall is entertaining all right. All the cast did good job. The story is told in a stylish way. The right kind of music is used just as the right moment.Superficially it might look like a children story or a comedy, but actually the film communicates to us some serious themes. A lack of love inside a family, a sense of loneliness, unacceptance from peers, and ignorance from other adults around them can lead children to violence, runaway, and too-early romantic relationship, for they have strong pull toward each other to compensate what they miss in their life. However, the film also gives us hope that with love and understanding and acceptance, we can stop them from getting lost. I think one of the best thing about this film is the way it makes me feel that the love between this girl and this boy and their runaway effort is like the big storm and the terrible flood that happened to this land, you can't stop it. You have to accept it as it is. It might do some damages, but in a long term, the plants grow much better on the land. It also shows us how we judge others base on what we are taught, but this movie ask questions like...does a scout leader who loses his whole troop really have to be an irresponsible leader? Does a police who loses two children under his protection is a lousy police? We adults often blame one another based on these superficial things when blaming doesn't help make anything better at all.I'm not a Wes Anderson Fan, but I like this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Kara is so intense and serious exactly how you'd expect a 20something jaded person to be not a twelve year old. She was superb! Sam plays a fantastic matter-of-fact, take- charge kid also acting much older than he is supposed to be. Both characters a great contrast to the other kids in the camp; who are always seen playing and goofing around. Actually, at times, the adults in the movie seem to be more childly innocent and playful, especially the character of Edward Norton. As for the famous A-list celebrity cast, they're great as usual. Even Tilda Swinton's 3 second role was entertaining.

"Good, in an eclectic, marmite kind of way...","With visual references to 1970s BBC comedy - ""Dad's Army"" (q.v.), quirky use of several of Benjamin Britten's works, heavily stylised dialogue and a strange insistence that every character (however minor) must be eccentric in some way - it is easy to understand why a number of people may find this movie too much, over-directed, too comic-book stilted to take seriously.In fact, as a pure comedy, I'm not sure I rate it. And as a young children's romance it is nowhere near as polished, powerful or satisfying as Submarine (2010) (q.v.), for instance. In fact that film and its debut writer/director Richard Ayoade simply get elevated in my estimation by the comparison.But for all its flaws (including relying on a large number of children of variable acting skills, the unnecessarily poorly written Social Worker - wasting Tilda Swinton's talents, and a number of rough edges left on the plot/motivation front), this film exudes a charm through attention to detail, wonderful cinematography, uniform brilliant acting by all the adults, and inspired choices for the two child leads. Whilst it may have too many quirky characters which can be distracting, a good handful of them are so interesting I am happy to overlook the others. This is wonderfully complemented by the musical combination of Benjamin Britten and Alexandre Desplat.Plus it is excellent to once again be reminded that when presented with a good script and director, Bruce Willis remains one of the USA's most compelling screen talents.It is probably fair to say that if you don't like any of the rest of Wes Anderson's ouvre, you will probably not like this. But for me, this was like the delight on being delivered the most delightfully inventive fresh fruit salad, full of succulent treats from far away, after been huddled away on a dull 1950's housing estate under grey raining clouds for 3 months on a diet of frozen pizza. The rays of sunshine from that dessert will keep me warm and inspired for many days to come. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Anderson movie for his fervent enemies,"To start off with an honest admission. I loathe Anderson's movies. Absolutely despise and have an innate repulsion to his ditsy kooky worlds. But despite this and in spite of my judgemental approach I found myself oddly enticed by ""The Moonrise Kingdom"", Anderson's finest work and most non-condescending, broad vision of filmaking.Anderson's sensibilities seem best attached to childhood sensibilities and world-view (although by no way am I implying this is a children's film, more like a redux of sorts into our perception of life when we were young), the island setting off the coast of New England seamlessly conspires to create a fantastic outlet for a wacky love story. Set in the 1960s it tells a story of an orphaned boy scout Sam (Jared Gilman), who finds a soul-mate in the local outcast Suzy (Kara Hayward). Together they plot an adventure and escape deep into the island to find freedom and themselves in the process. Hot on their heels are pedantic scout master Ward (Edward Norton), the local police officer captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Suzy's parents, the Bishops (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand).""The Moonrise Kingdom"" is bogged down knee-deep in references to movies (and general culture) of the era, thus a cinephile goldmine for those interested. Anderson gives his respectful nod not only at classic features like ""Badlands"", ""The Shining"" or the obvious ""Shawshank Redemption"", but also is incessantly self-referential (my biggest issue with the movie). Of superb appeal is the widely fantastic soundtrack based on obscure titles from back in the day, adding to the fantastical setting of nonsensical and magical. For once (and only once) I found myself unprovoked to discard the inherent quirkiness, instead to grasp the fleeting playfulness of the story and its characters. Not yet an Anderson convert, but now at least bound to give him the benefit of the doubt. A charming and re-watchable piece of escapist glee. Honestly - never though I would ever say something like that about an Anderson film...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Greatest Movie To Date I Have Watched,"To be honest with you all; every time Wes Anderson makes a movie it is my favorite movie. I did not like the animated one so much, but it was still good though. Ever since I saw the The Royal Tenenbaums (2001), I have been a huge fan of Wes Anderson's work. I had a link and a statement on my original Radman_Art web site since about 2001 saying: Wes Anderson is my favorite director. I do not know why but they remind me of being a child when I see his movies with children as characters. The Royal Tenenbaums reminded me of growing up on the East Coast. The The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou reminded of my vacations on the beaches of the East Coast and my fascination with the ocean.Moonrise Kingdom (2012) reminds me a lot of the era of the film; as I remember it as a child. It reminds me a little of when I set out on my own to live in Florida as a 16 year old young man. The children do not remind me of me as characters; except the sea side house reminded me of the houses we would stay in along the beach for summer vacation.Long live Wes Anderson's work as a director. Every movie he makes; is my all time favorite. I can not wait to rent The Grand Budapest Hotel!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't stir enough emotions!,"I like to compare Wes Anderson movies with chocolate chip cakes with a base of bread (emotions) hidden under the covering of chocolate (eccentricity) and a lot of chips (chuckles) spread in between. This movie felt like a bite from the top of that cake with enough chocolate and chips in it, but practically no bread. It didn't stir any emotions in me. Add to that a poorly executed almost comical ending sequence with random things happening. The screenplay was not boring as such, but it lacked freshness.Wes is famous for using pastel colors in his movies, which I think work best when you are working in a set and not in a natural environment filled with trees and beaches like in this movie. The buildup to the scissor scene was great but the payoff leaves a sour taste in your mouth. The VFX of the blast which gave Edward Norton the chance to show off his heroics was also very off putting.The actors I believe gave their best (especially the child actors) but it's very difficult to pull off these eccentric roles. It is very evident from the fact that the best you feel in the movie was when Jason Schwartzman was on the screen, which unfortunately, was not for long.The characters appeared interesting but most of the time don't give you enough to force you to have some empathy for them. The intimacy scene (you know what I am talking about) was awkward to watch at best.Overall, it was not a bad movie, but it definitely ranks among Wes Anderson's weaker ones for me.(PS - the painting that closed the movie was beautiful)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Pretentious, artsy-fartsy, boring  BS","I hated 'Bottle Rocket', hated 'Rushmore', hated 'The Royal Tennenbaums'. Surprise! I hated Moonrise Kingdom. Why do I keep watching Wes Anderson's movies? Because I keep hearing/reading all this great stuff about 'em. Bottle Rocket was the highly touted first Anderson film, so I watched that. I didn't get it. Rushmore got all these great reviews, and I didn't connect that it was made by the same guy that made Bottle Rocket, so that time I got tricked. Stinko. The praise for The Royal Tennenbaums was so over the top that I thought there must be something wrong with me for hating the two previous films, so I watched it and wanted to kill myself by the halfway point. I successfully avoided his next few films and then I got tricked again 'cause I didn't know Moonrise Kingdom was a Wes Anderson movie until the FIRST TWO MINUTES when it was unmistakable. ""OH NO, NOT AGAIN"" I thought. I don't understand why anyone likes this boring crap with 'quirky' dialog delivered in a monotone, long shots of nothing (someone's front yard with no one in the frame for a full minute, for example) and plots and situations with no basis in reality (but not in a good way). Of course, I despised 'Lost In Translation' and 'Safety Not Guaranteed' too. But I am an un-hip philistine and clearly I'll never develop the cultural palate to appreciate Wes Anderson's 'craft'. Watching this movie is torture. If you want to be entertained, avoid it like the plague. No more Wes Anderson for me. Ever again.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Children's Adventure Made For Adults,"Wonderfully pictured, deftly written & nicely performed, Moonrise Kingdom tells the tale of a pair of young lovers who flee together from their town which causes the local search party to fan out & find them. Those who are not familiar with the director's previous works might find it quite weird, just like me, and yet the best part of this film is its eccentricity only.Be it Wes Anderson's quirky direction, idiosyncratic characters, cheerful performances, gorgeous cinematography, strange costumes or peculiar music, every single element of the film manages to work here because of its bizarreness. Bruce Willis & Edward Norton deliver fine performances from its ensemble cast but it's the child actors who take away the big chunk of applause, especially Kara Hayward.On an overall scale, taking us back to the time when we couldn't wait to grow up, when we had our first crushes & when we simply wanted to run away from home after a small fight, Moonrise Kingdom is an original story of young love & innocence and is a children's adventure made for adults which in the end didn't turn out to be as emotionally rewarding for me as it has for others.",,Anonymous,Romance
This movie is an 11,"This movie is a beautiful work of art. I hadn't watched a movie more than once in several years until I came across this gem. Critics say that it suffers from style over substance. Well, those critics fail to see how the style adds to the substance. The narrator of the music composition is simultaneously the narrator of the film. The storm is simultaneously the climax to the plot and a metaphor for the story. The dark, brooding angst of adolescence is somehow captured with a 50's-styled beach dance. It is a superbly crafted, imaginative movie that sets a benchmark for years to come. Not giving this movie a 10 shows more about the moviegoer than the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Transcends our expectations of cinema,"I walked into ""Moonrise Kingdom"" with absolutely no expectations. I'm someone who is very open to all genres... I can watch ""There Will Be Blood"" endlessly, and turn around to watch a film like ""Transformers"" - accepting both for what they are.This movie is an anomaly. Not only is the style something rarely seen, but I couldn't categorize the movie at all.While watching there were moments in which I felt this was some of the most brilliant direction I've ever seen, while there were other moments that I wished had been replaced with something more... fitting. This was my reaction in the theatre.Now that the film has really been setting in, I've realized that this might be one of the most perfect movies I've ever seen. Not only did it hit the beats perfectly, and carry a fantastic - yet subtle - sense of humour, this film really triumphed in executing a perfect depiction of memory.Nothing about this film is ""real"", nor is it intended to be. Watching was like recalling childhood memories of a first love, the way we once perceived adults, etc. The visuals are that of a memory, the exaggeration of certain components are that of memory, etc. etc. etc. - And likely not coincidentally, I now think back on many of its moments as something that exist as a memory... rather than something I watched on a 70 ft screen for $12 admission.Brilliant Writing. Brilliant Photography. Impeccable Direction.Whether or not you enjoy this film upon first viewing, I encourage you to look at this film for what it does, rather than what it is. You will realize that in many ways it transcends what we come to expect of cinema, and gives us something entirely new and magical.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bold and Marvelously Quirky,"There are few films these days that take bona fide chances. Most productions coming out of Hollywood are formulaic, predictable, and saturated with commonplace. They rely on the same time-tested magnets--special effects, violence, some titillating romance, or toilet jokes.Occasionally a movie comes along that breaks that pattern and changes our perspectives, The Artist being a fine example. Moonrise Kingdom not only takes chances, it does it with zeal. Daring is at the heart of this film. Start with the acting. Edward Norton is exceptional as the over-zealous Khaki Scout leader. Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand take infidelity to a new and hilarious level. And Tilda Swinton, what can you say about a character who refers to herself as Social Services? Every character makes us laugh, cringe, and simply, truly feel their personality. Now move to the screenplay, the use of maps, a narrator, impending hurricanes, social upheaval on a small island, and the anxious calm of young misfits running away from it all.Films like this, the ones that can't quite be compartmentalized into neat genres, are incredibly difficult to bring off. Moonrise Kingdom does it with a boldness not soon forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Most Sincere Childhood Memories,"Most of Wes Anderson's movies are very clever, so clever that mainstream movie goers do not understand him. Writer of the Royal Tenenbaums and director of Fantastic Mr. Fox makes another simple and very fascinating picture about two young lovers.Suzy and Sam are 12. They love each other but Sam is a Scout, living in the camp and Suzy is a daughter of sever parents. So they escape, from everywhere and from everyone, try to go very far far away. Unfortunately they live on the island and there is no much to go.I loved the idea, the way writers wrote and director screened it.Both writers (Wes and Roman) have done an amazing job by showing originality of true love through the eyes of 12 year old adults. The movie is smart, quick, fresh, the dialog between beloved children are so much real that I felt like watching some my neighbor kids talking.But in the end, I recognized that the movie is not about children, or childhood. This is about memories, how we'll remember our very early years when we're over 40s, it's about what we gonna see or feel when our memories evoke. That's because both writers (who actually are over their 40s) wrote about their childhood thoughts.So, Moonrise Kingdom is different from other movies as it's very honest, emotional and mostly concentrates on real life than on arts. It's something that came from the hearts of screenplay writers and shaped in the very sincere way.Also, every scene in this movie is spectacular. Can't even imagine how this beautiful world was born in Wes's mind. The island itself is perfect and helps pretty much to tell the story. If anyone has dreamed about adventures and virtual worlds this one could be exact match - another childish memory.At last, I think this movie is totally different from other Wes Anderson's movies. Unlike the Royal Tenenbaums, the story-line is simpler, more easy-watching and fun. Director makes you love every character , every piece of the film and grabs you back to old times. When you finish watching it, I bet you gonna be smiling and that could be most emotional smile so far.Read it on my blog: http://running-reel.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
None of the characters are perfect and I love it.,"Lovable adventure of boys and a girl (?)My dad loves the part where Suzy cuts a boy with her medical scissors because it was unpredictable & unbelievable for him. I felt same tbh. This movie wasn't typical adventure/family drama/love story/Anderson film. I think this was when Anderson trying to make his films in more sophisticated, tidy, Anderson way. And that's why it felt a little wild than now. (I only watched his previous four films before watch this.)Whenever I watch Wes Anderson films, I feel feelings I don't understand. It somehow looks like deepest stories in the world, but in fact I think there's nothing. It's because his eagerness in creating films makes his films deep, not because the script is well-crafted. He lives in the scenes and the script is just a means to tell them. Moreover, there's no perfect person in Wes films. In this case, Bruce Wills seems nicest person, but he does affair as his character so he's not perfect. It makes his films relatable, deep, interesting.I'm not one of the haters, but ""Sexualization"" of the children was makes me uncomfortable. I don't know if it is normal thing in the country where Wes Anderson and the targeted audience grow up, but at that age I watched Disney movies and had no interest except for movies. Of course, that's an important factor in portraying coming of age drama, and I understand there's pure enthusiasm for sexual things in that age for some people, but it doesn't have to be that exaggerated...I think it takes me a little time to love this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the most beautifully touching films of 2012,"Bob Balaban's narrator begins, - in Brectian mannerisms talking directly to the camera - provider of information on the small fictitious New Penzance island, its topography, and landmarks. It is 1965, and in a few days a great storm will hit the island, a storm that could literally and metaphysically wash the islands stilted problems away. Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) - whom we later discover to be an orphan - escapes from the Khaki Scout camp, and rendezvous with Suzy (Kara Haywood), an island girl with emotional issues (a meeting that was organised the year before, when the met at a church play of Benjamin Britten's opera 'Noye's Fludde'). The pair of young lovers escape to go on an adventure together, and the island's inhabitants, including Suzy's overbearing, attorney parents, Walt and Laura Bishop (played by Bill Murray and Frances McDormand respectively), form a search party - the Khaki scout camp residents also form a militant party, in search of Sam, none of whom like him because he is ""crazy"" due to the death of his parents.Wes Anderson brings his usual aesthetic idiosyncrasies to the film, his wondrously controlled tracking shots, tilts and pans; and the films narrative settings fill the screen with beautifully vivid, saturated autumnal colours - incidentally Suzy lives in a house at Summers End. As you might expect from the Khaki Scouts, led by Edward Norton's Scout Master Ward, their costumes are suitably coloured, and the costumes say much about the strong divisions between the adult and child world. Whilst the fugitive lovers form an incredibly poignant and mature relationship - and they are the most ""adult"" characters in the film - the literal adults simply force their own problems and insecurities on the young, particularly Suzy's parents, who's profession in law is brought into the home (amusingly McDormand's Laura, uses a megaphone to communicate in their family home).In an early scene, the camera dolly's across the Khaki Scout camp, following Norton as he surveys the morning activities of his camp. Anderson's camera (as with the majority of his films) has presence in his films, practically becoming an arbiter of the comedy value in a scene. Here, we review, for example, a treehouse project of humorous proportions, as a collection of the boys build it precariously at the top of a very tall tree. Anderson's iconography, his frames and compositions also provide humour, and his aesthetic attention to detail is also highlighted in the sequence where Sam's escape from camp is discovered. The interior of the tents are set up like a bedroom, replete with decoration, seating, carpeted floors and storage. A small hole is discovered as exit point - a farcical moment indeed.Aside from the aesthetic and character comedy, the films colour pallet perfectly reflects its more tender and meloncholly narrative moments. The somber and laconic police captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) is informed by Sam's foster father that he is no longer welcome back into their home, and he is left in his custody until Tilda Swinton's authoritarian, by-the-books, Social Services (that is her name, this is who she is) collects the boy for institutional correction - i.e. orphanage - perhaps electroshock therapy. In Sam and Suzy, we have a pair of troubled ""problem"" children, who find solace and connectedness in their relationship - away from the restrictions, and socially conventional ""normal"" of the seemingly more ""problem"" adult world. It is the culmination of these many strands that Anderson brings together so beautifully, in a film that knows when to be amusing, laugh-out-loud funny; when to be melancholy and poignant; when to be tender or forceful.Along with the adult cast, who are typically brilliant (Murray has been a regular to Anderson's ensemble since 1998's Rushmore - and including Harvey Keitel's Scout Commander), have their performances outdone by a fantastic young cast. The film is, after all, one about children. Besides the terrific performances from the leads (at 12 and 13 years old, they show incredible maturity and humanism in their methodically minded characters), but also from the band of eccentrically uniformed Scouts. Anderson's previous film, the excellently twisted Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), was his first foray into animation, and looking at the dynamics of Moonrise Kingdom, the techniques seem to have influenced him slightly. Combining with his other idiosyncratic techniques, makes this one of the most delightfully charming films I have seem for some time - and could arguably be one of the most beautifully touching of 2012.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonrise Kingdom,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, Wes Anderson knows how to make a weird and stylish film. This film is probably the most stylish film he has ever made. The film always looks like a picture book with vibrant colors and textures. It has the feeling of a fictional world meets a real world. The plot is whimsical and funny with hints of emotional moments. For me, the film was just too weird and overly stylish. The story was okay.The acting is all around good. Bruce Willis, Bob Balaban, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jared Gilman, Kaya Hayward, and Jason Schwartzman all perform well. Bill Murray takes the cake on this one because he is hilarious.The pacing for me was a little slow but the runtime is very short.Pros: Okay story, amazing colors and textures, good acting, Bill Murray is hilarious, and a short runtimeCons: Too stylish, very weird, slow pacing, and for me it was too whimsicalOverall Rating: 7.0",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annoyingly quirky and pretentious,"I just can't fathom why this movie is getting such good reviews. Most likely the first and last Wes Anderson movie I'm seeing. There's nothing genuine or charming in this film. There's just this forced intentional quirkiness to this film that I can't stand. It just tries too hard to be quirky and cute and ends up feeling pretentious. The line between quirky and annoying can be very thin indeed and for me this movie crossed it by a mile.The film is partly categorized as a comedy but I didn't even get a slight chuckle during the entire film. Was I supposed to? Everything's delivered deadpan and I didn't buy the dialogue between Sam and Suzy at all. Deadpan humor is good and all but you can't have everyone doing it for the whole movie. Also, I didn't like this whole idea of kids delivering adult dialogue and ended up disliking the protagonists a lot. They didn't feel like kids in the slightest so how is this whole first love between kids angle going to work here then? They're just flat and emotionally detached. All of the characters are essentially missing a human core.I also didn't buy the love story between Sam and Suzy and that makes everything else pointless. I'm supposed to think they're in love but it didn't even seem like they liked each other. Didn't care for the rest of the characters either despite there being some serious talent behind them. If there had been at least one or two there who I liked somewhat I wouldn't give this one star. Visually it was kind of interesting but without a good story and characters, what does it matter?",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The movie all Wes Anderson movies were leading up to!,"There are roughly 171,476 words in current use and 47,156 obsolete words in your average dictionary these days, but there's only one word that can eloquently express the full genius of Wes Anderson's style of filmmaking: Weird.Yes, generally the polite way of putting it is by using the euphemism 'quirky' or even 'idiosyncratic' (if you are writing for expensive magazines), but all his odd little films have pointed us in one direction: Wes Anderson seems a bit of a kooky chap, doesn't he?There's only one word to express the full genius of Wes Anderson's style of filmmaking: Weird.In his five live-action films before Moonrise Kingdom including The Darjeeling Limited, Anderson has, each time, managed to create an unreal and unhinged world of fractured people who spend the whole movie trying to come to terms with that one thing that characters in most other films wear on their sleeves—feelings.You may not agree with the unnatural behaviour of characters in his films *ahem* 'I' may not agree with the unnatural behaviour of characters in his films (barring to an extent, Rushmore, which I love), but it's probably true that Anderson gets laid a lot.Because although it's hard to point out exactly, there's that quality about Anderson's films that would make women dig him—there's something inherently innocent, sweet and otherworldly about them, almost as if Anderson refused to grow up while everyone around him suddenly starting being adults. There's a certain mystery and romanticism about Anderson too, that, when combined with his distinctive shot-taking, manifest into movies that you may or may not love, but definitely can't ignore.Anderson's new movie, Moonrise Kingdom, is the pinnacle of that manifestation— it is that movie that all of Anderson's movies were naturally leading up to, and which Anderson probably took so much time in making because, somewhere, even he was pretending to be an adult. But in his simplest film to date, Anderson has gleefully let go, and let his heart take over his head.Unlike most Anderson's films, and to borrow Bollywood jargon, there is a definite 'hero' and a definite 'heroine' in Moonrise Kingdom. Except that the two are 12-year-olds, who fall in love and run away together, in the summer of 1965.The idyllic setting, as is in all Anderson films, lends to the charm—the movie is set on a Khaki Scout camp on New Penzance, an island somewhere in New England. The setting is a hint that an adventure is waiting to happen—and Anderson does not disappoint, as the star-crossed lovers camp and hitchhike through 'Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet' trying to get through to the other side, where they intend to marry and live together forever.Add to this fairy-tale love story, a sprinkling of those damaged adults trying to rain on their parade (including a very evil Tilda Swinton), and a destructive storm doing so quite literally, and you have that rare enchanting romantic comedy, that is both romantic and a comedy. The two leads (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) are —and there is no more sophisticated way of putting this – supremely cute, and the rest of the cast is terrific too.Bill Murray is exactly the right amount of brilliant that's needed to make every Anderson film superior and Harvey Keitel, Frances McDormand and Jason Schwartzman add more value to the proceedings.But two unlikely actors steal the show —Edward Norton, of American History X and The Incredible Hulk fame—is endearing (yes, you read me right) and the very bada** Bruce Willis, whose casting first sounded as ridiculous as it would have sounded if Wes Anderson was to direct Die Hard 5, is, *ahem*, adorable in a role that requires him to play the anti-John McLane.Moonrise Kingdom is a must-watch and a worthy addition to delightful first-love comedies like Little Manhattan, Flipped and the brilliant Son of Rambow, because it is about that time of our lives when love is at its purest —when love *is* love—much before we grow up and grow old and become one of those idiosyncratic, fractured characters in quirky Wes Anderson movies (whose unnatural behaviour I may not agree with).Nikhil Taneja (Firstpost.com) www.twitter.com/tanejamainhoonFor more reviews: http://www.firstpost.com/author/nikhil",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Anderson at his BEST!!,"I've always been a fan of odd movies, especially Wes Anderson's style. After listening to many reviews (some good, some bad, some really good), I decided to watch it myself. There's really no other way to put it...PHENOMENAL. Anderson proved himself to be one of the greatest directors of our time. In reality, this idea would have seemed...well, strange and not in the slightest interest of most people. Anderson, though, said ""This is my story, and I'm going to make it the best film of the year,"" which so far is true. Everything about this film is perfect (excluding the newcoming lead actors), from the cinematography to the beautiful coloring to the hilarious yet profound set. The cast was chosen so well, especially Bill Murray as the father and Edward Norton as the Boy Scout leader. I recommend this film to anyone, even if you're not into the Indie style. This film is heart- warming, delightful, quirky, and sometimes a bit touching. Go support Anderson's latest and undoubtedly his best film yet.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wes Anderson's Best Film Since Rushmore,"Wes Anderson provides us with a beautiful story of love, adventure, and youth in this wonderful comedy. With the help of an All-Star cast featuring Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Jason Schwartzman, and Bill Murray, we are told a story that many of us can relate to in some way, a story of wanting to belong. Throughout the movie, we are provided with the familiar ""dry"" and ""subtle"" humor that we are used to from many of Anderson's previous films. When I saw this movie in theaters, I expected a good film with a few laughs just as I have experienced from Wes Anderson's previous films, but my expectations were far exceeded. Wes Anderson can now be considered in the film industry's elite writers/directors of all time and is perhaps one of the greatest film makers of this generation. If you have at least one working eye and a pulse, see Moonrise Kingdom immediately. You'll regret you hadn't seen it sooner.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Wonderful and Quirky Film,"My husband and I really enjoyed this quirky and charming film. We thought the acting was quite good all around, especially the lead kids. The locations are wonderful. The plot is wonderfully twisted and strangely fascinating. It has intriguing background ""bits of business"" that are fun to watch. It made us think of a dysfunctional American Harry Potter and Hermione Granger together in love at last on their own adventure, running away from their prescribed roles. Sam is even an orphan. Suzy's parents aren't both dentists, but they are both lawyers. All of the great adult actors in odd and amusing parts even seemed like the litany of British actors who filled up the Potter movies. We wondered about the books Susy read aloud (she seemed like Wendy with the lost boys) and who wrote them. We can hardly wait to see it again, and to see the DVD when it comes out, so we can slow it down and look at it like a storybook.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incredibly eccentric and charming,"The only other Wes Anderson film I have ever seen is Fantastic Mr. Fox, but this has, undeniably, the same tone and style in many ways. I think technically-wise, it's pretty amazing. The staging of certain scenes, along with the cinematography, editing, and music score are all wonderful (although I wonder how much of the score is original). The story is also told in a very charming, light-hearted way, but it isn't a ""kid's film"". There's really not much to say except that it's an eccentric, charming, wonderfully creative film that feels completely alive, and so, so different from the many formulaic films out right now. Or maybe I hadn't seen a film this great in a long time. Call it an actual original ""romantic comedy"".",,Anonymous,Romance
This is why I go to movies,"Wes Anderson creates spectacular quotidian worlds. Every detail in every one of his frames is meticulously realized; like Dickens, he leaves no loose ends. The shot that still has me dizzy is the view we get of the Bishop's living room, all violently clashing plaids, set off by the incredibly garish slacks being sported by the bare-chested Mr. Bishop (Bill Murray) on his way to ""find a tree and chop it down"". What other directors, seeking to emulate Anderson's whimsy and tweeness, don't understand is the sheer amount of bloody diligence which goes into creating these immaculate universes. Where Anderson's hermetically ordered worlds are allowed breathing space is in the latitude he gives his actors to bring their characters to life, and in this film the adult actors relax nicely into their roles. Where Anderson really gives free reign is to his juvenile actors, the Khaki Scout troop as well as the two leads, and they reward him with energetic, fully inhabited performances.The sole sour note on the evening was having to see this wonderful movie at The Sundance Kabuki, where the ""amenity fee"" brought the price of my ticket to $13.50. In no way do I regard having to choose my seat before seeing the house an amenity; in fact, it is quite the reverse. This website won't let me publish my true, ""Deadwood""-ian opinion of Mr. Redford, so I will just state that it will hopefully be a long time before I have to patronize his theater again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Arguably, Wes Anderson's greatest yet","MOONRISE KINGDOM, directed by Wes Anderson, is a quirky masterpiece; full of meticulous attention to detail, as well as stylish cinematography. Many of the auteur's signature filming techniques are on display here: optical zooms, deadpan humor; vivid and bright colors, long and smooth panning. But one thing that makes it better than, or equal to, other phenomenal movies of his like RUSHMORE or THE DARJEELING LIMITED is the character development of it all (maybe even mostly the characters themselves, including their costume design). Multiple people that differ greatly become likable through harsh, yet funny dialog (""That's a loaded question""), as well as their reactions to the sticky situations that surround them.This clever tool, also used in FANTASTIC MR. FOX, especially comes in handy for a film like this, because MOONRISE KINGDOM contains many different fragments making up a single plot: a storm striking, the romance of two people 12 years old, the town's frantic efforts to find them, etc. It's a busy movie, but also one of the best and most enjoyable of the year because of the way everything is handled; each character serves a purpose.Lines are delivered by great actors/actresses like Tilda Swinton (giving a great performance as Social Services) and the occasionally funny Bruce Willis. Bob Balaban is also there (dressed as a garden gnome) to occasionally give the viewers subtle narration on the history of the idyllic New Penzance (a New England island). Of course, there's a Jason Schwartzman role, as usual in Anderson films. At times, one might think that all of the famous actors/actresses are an overload and an attempt to give the film more buzz. But this is not the case; each actor/actress precisely fits the role of their character.With a gorgeous set, opulent-quality cinematography, nonlinear characters, and brilliant writing, MOONRISE KINGDOM is arguably Wes Anderson's greatest yet. It may not seem to be for those accusing the auteur of style over substance, but this one's got both, so there shouldn't be that many worries over that either.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sick, twisted, and still boring.","This movie was extremely disappointing. Either Wes Anderson is a pedophile in disguise, or he's got some strange ideas about the need to display child sexuality that we, as a population, should NOT be comfortable with. Even if he didn't realize what he was doing was twisted, someone should have told him. No, pedophilia can't exactly be helped or controlled, but it certainly shouldn't be encouraged! Regardless of the lack of nudity, a 12 year old girl and boy fondling each other in their underwear? This kind of display of child sexuality is never okay, it blurs the line that we do NOT want to cross. The child violence is another thing, although it was done a little better than something like Hunger Games, because of the added humor....but who was this movie really made for? Who's the audience? I've seen previous Anderson films, and I guess I'm not sure what led to this one being made.He took what could have been an interesting story, gave it lackluster dialog, unnecessary character development for some, while not enough for others, and threw borderline kiddie porn in there, making it boring and perverse.Aside from the acting of Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, and Kara Howard, this film isn't worth watching. Unless of course, you're a man who either is into, or isn't sure if he's into, little twelve year old girls or boys.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Magical,"Wes Anderson has created a magical world with a superb cast including two twelve year olds who match the talents of Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton, and Harvey Keitel. Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman are Suzy and Sam, a couple of outcasts who have no friends and are considered trouble by the adults around them. Sam is a foster child struggling with loneliness, and Suzy is an introvert; and they seem to have been fated to meet, and when they do, a pen pal relationship develops. Sam is at a boy scout camp on an island, and Suzy is living with her mother and father, with three younger brothers in a seemingly perfect house with white picket fence, and everything in its place. Sam runs away, as does Suzy, and they find each other and escape with a tent and other gear to get away from the elders who don't understand them. Although very young, the pair have a connection which belies their age. This is basically a love story. The settings are striking, with strong red and blue pastels, the houses perfect, in a Norman Rockwell kind of way. The style reminded me of Jean Pierre Jeunet's Micmacs, another quirky film. I was caught up with the story from start to finish. Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman are exceptional finds by Anderson, and they are able to carry Moonrise Kingdom to a level of true art.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
alright,"I hate most Wes Anderson films, mainly because they don't have any sense of believability. People don't talk like that, think like that, look like that - all semblance of reality is sacrificed to make things arty and quirky and supposedly humorous. He is doing something right judging by the acclaim: it seems that I simply don't 'get it'.All that said, I was surprised to quite enjoy this. It still suffered from the usual pitfalls of his films, with poor dialogue and a focus on cool, unusual, deliberately left-field scenes instead of character development and a compelling plot, but overall it was cute and fun and vaguely entertaining.

Adorable movie!,"I absolutely loved it!I didn't know what to expect going in, but I ended up with a lingering smile on my face and a warm, fuzzy feeling on the inside.The story isn't very complicated, even though the number of characters might make it seem so. It's a simple story of love at an age where love is deep and life lasting, seen through the innocent eyes of a couple of children stuck in a world made messy by the mistakes of adults. They don't understand everything that goes on around them but they feel it all acutely.It's also the story of redemption, making the point that it's never too late to change your life and make it what you want it to be.The acting is very good especially surprising coming from the young actors which I, personally, hadn't seen before in anything else. I don't think that anyone needs telling that Bruce Willis and Bill Murray gave wonderful performances.This is definitely the movie for you, if you're in the mood for a slow paced love story that gives you time to think about it all and also gives surprising laugh-out-loud-by-yourself moments.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fans of Anderson will love this movie. I thought it was OK but not his best. Worth seeing but not for everyone. I say B.,"""You two are the most appallingly incompetent custodial guardians Social Services has ever had the misfortune to encounter in a 27 year career."" While sitting down to breakfast one morning Scout Master Ward (Norton) notices that one of his troops is missing. He quickly calls Captain Sharp (Willis) and the word is passed on to the parents. When it comes out that the boy has run off with another local girl not only do the parents get involved but Social Services is called in also. This may end up being a pretty short review because since this is a Wes Anderson movie people have already kind of made up their mind on whether to watch or not. His style is not for everyone. To me I either really love his stuff or I don't. I really like almost all his work (I didn't like ""Royal Tananbaums"") but to me ""Rushmore"" and ""Fantastic Mr. Fox"" are his best. This one is not at the level of those movies but this is still pretty funny. There are few directors that have a definite style and you know instantly that it's one of their movies. Anderson, Kubric and Hitchcock are the ones that come immediately to mind. Again though this is funny but not for everyone, very dry humor. Overall, if you like Wes Anderson movies then you will love this one, if not then it's 50/50 if you will enjoy it. I thought it was OK but not his best. I give it a B.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
B Movie - Really .... A Bomb,"So, this is my first- and last- Wes Anderson movie. Previously, I watched a five-minute segment from 'The Life Aquatic' and should have known better as that was dreadful (my wife's a fan). But I'm on summer vacation and this is the only movie playing here. Visually, this is nothing special: colors are muted and the costumes seem to have come from a Goodwill store. The camera work/editing is amateurish. My biggest problem with this movie is the story and the acting/direction. This is primarily a comedy, but it's not funny at all. For example, when the young couple run away and they're near the river, the boy says to the girl, ""I want to catch a turtle, but you have to be careful because they can bite your fingers."" She doesn't say anything in response. Then, cut to the boy catching a turtle in his net; he turns it over and says, ""Look, someone wrote their name on this turtle."" 'Albert' was written on it. And that's it for this brief scene. What was the purpose of this scene? It's stupid. Moonrise Kingdom is full of meaningless scenes like this one. A movie made by nerds (very likely on mind altering substances) for nerds. Woody Allan's 'To Rome, With Love' is a lot funnier, and the humor found in Alexander Payne's films, like 'About Schmidt' is even more sublime.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
children harbor the capacity for emancipation,"i had a good feeling about this movie beforehand. i expected a good movie, but nevertheless i was taken by the feeling of cinematic satisfaction mixed with jubilation.. the film presents the idea that it is the children who harbor the capacity for emancipation, instead of wearied adults caught in their lifetime of burdens and obligations. Anderson then chooses to instill the notion that the adults are more likely to evolve through contact with children than the other waythroughout the film, visible as usual are the signs of signature Wes Anderson enunciative visual texture; very geometric layout, linear camera movements, perpendicular settings, colorful framing, sequenced narrative.. the accelerated epistolary correspondence between Suzie and Sam is especially excellentthere's also this feeling of omnipresent subtle sarcasm that brings a little sadness with it; because while we smile at their implications, they also bother us, as we have increasingly more in common with the characters of Bruce Willis, Edward Norton and Bill Murray than we would like to admit.. if Moonrise Kingdom is not Wes Anderson's masterpiece, then very little is missing",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonrise Kingdom: What kind of bird are YOU?,"If you have yet to see Moonrise Kingdom by Wes Anderson, you definitely should.A (basic) summary of the plot:Boy meets girl. They fall in love. Pack up their possessions. Empty their savings. And Run away together.(Oh, and did I mention they're 12 years old?)'That's ridiculous!' you might say. Not if it happens in a Wes Anderson movie.Despite the absurd storyline, the movie somehow just works. And for those 94 minutes we are sucked into the naive world of Sam and Suzy, feeling like the rest of the world just doesn't get 'it'.The cast was definitely one of the things that made it work. The 2 young characters (with Suzy pretty much a splitting image of Lana del Ray) carried their own alongside quite an ensemble of actors including Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray and Tilda Swinton.It's hard to find fault with this film but if I had to I'd say not everyone will enjoy the sporadic method of storytelling and the sometimes surreal quality of the movie. If you like your movies to flow from A to B and grounded in reality without an ounce of humour then perhaps this isn't for you.It was quite clear the amount of meticulous planning and thought that went into just one scene, with so much happening in the background and foreground that each on its own resembled a vivid painting or photograph. So it's quite amazing that Wes Anderson managed to tell an entire story almost through a series of well-framed photographs.For me though, it was these gaps and silences and the dream-induced quality that were some the best features of the film. That and the cameo by one of Santa's elves shooting homemade nature documentaries.IMDb: 8/10Rotten Tomatoes: 94%",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
If you like Tim Burton you will like Wes Anderson,"A fun movie. Maybe not quite a classic like Beetlejuice but will entertain for years as the story is timeless and done with a totally straight face by every character, even though it was so totally odd, quirky and funny that it never could be possible in real life. I kept looking for Johnny Depp, knowing he he had to be in it, but he wasn't.The filmmaker Wes Anderson made each scene a viewer's paradise, as the main scene was always just part of the whole action. Two, three or even four odd and strange sub-scenes were always in the background, so each time you see it you will see something great you may have missed before.The story is of a foster home runaway twelve year old Khaki Scout boy who meets a lonely girl on a rural East Coast island, and love blooms. The entire story is how they constantly evaded being found after running away to hide together in all the island's secret spots, but then were found.Bill Murray and Frances McDormand were the girl's very odd parents, with Edward Norton in an against-type role as the dead serious, officious and so-procedurally-correct Khaki Scout Master. His scout camp scenes with his scouts were priceless. Anderson is a master of scene decoration and cast costuming as well as dialog, and constantly hits exactly what is needed perfectly for best audience effect.The zany dialog was always spoken so earnestly, even though it was mostly outrageous, which made it best for surprise and resulting big laughs no matter how unlikely the story or dialog so it never seemed contrived or phony. It was so well done that it will be one of the summer's best comedies, for sure. If you liked the total quirkiness of Ed Wood, Ghost Story or Big Fish, you will like this one.

"Sweet and marvellous, story of floating weeds","I was looking to unwind the other night, this did the job and more, much more. And even though I am not a fan of this guy, this amazed me. I say I am not a fan simply because, though talented in many respects, the point of the exercise usually leaves me indifferent: clean, symmetry, demure distance as a matter of inferring richness. He seems a bit like a middle road between commercial imagination and the really interesting guys.This is full, I'm very happy to say. It's more than whimsy and colors, it's a spiritual, transcendent vision richly so.The premise is partially satisfying, a boy-scout of 12 runs off with a kindred soul. You know there is a journey ahead of you, but what kind of journey remains to be seen. It could go either way. In ordinary Hollywood hands, it would be a matter of simple affirmation of personal destiny. In 'arthouse' hands, there would be malaise and some sort of modern commentary. But pile on that several more layers that ever-so-subtly interweave, and it blossoms into something else, a flower of beauty.There is the kid-world with kids rehearsing for adulthood either at home or in boy-scout camp, excluding our two protagonists. There is the controlling world of adults, not necessarily callous people but hardened and slowly emptied by life, like someone has been moving furniture out of a room. A third is the shared journey of love and commitment to a soulmate, and much escapade and tension as the other two try to reign them in. Anderson's deliberate flatness emphasizes a sense of weary adulthood in the kids, wounded children in the adults. This is great because, with characters chosen as he has, you have all sorts of rich interplay of emotional dynamics: the Norton character as the grown kid, McDormand's mother as the girl and two possible lives ahead of her.And there is nature, at first soft and lulling, the picture-perfect nature of storybooks, but we learn a hurricane is underway.Those are all parts of the symphony, four different families of organs, slight variations of different musical color. Individually they have melody, but you can sense the lack of gravity and counterpoint, in fact that is what the opening scene demonstrates.Where it blossoms, is once Anderson pitches everything together for the symphonic crescendo of the breakthrough attempt. It roughly begins from the point when the siren draws forth the storm, possibly earlier. He could have conducted this in two ways, both ordinary - madcap adventure or more and more sombre elegy of loss.He settled for a third, Tarkovsky's way. This is where our field of vision imperceptibly shifts from a 'real world' to one of urges and intuition so powerful it brings down the skies, brings forth a hidden fabric of magical elements.This is not the 'real magic' of ordinary fantasy films, simply the product of an imaginative narrator. Best seen in Tarkovsky's Zerkalo, it is the confluence of a narrator (a point-of-view) and a universe blowing the roof off his story, sucking him off into space, expanding and deepening both narrator and story (and what we accommodate as either).You will note, in fact, even before they meet, urges in the two lovers so powerful they manifest as the inexplicable setting of fire during sleepwalking or uncontrollable bursts of violence in the girl. From the perspective of the adults, they're simply troubled kids caught in mischief. But that same sleepwalking fire and violence are also forces in the soul which, if the partner and circumstances are right, you can transform into deep connection. And once out in the world, that has power to transform others and the shared space of reality, like a gust of wind blows a window open.This is beautiful. Four worlds (kids - adults - lovers - nature) with variations and interplay that compliment one vision.A center in none of the four but in the journey that goes through and changes them all, the gust of soul-wind that opens windows.And the third of two dimensions; binocular (cinematic) vision, pretend magic that comes real.It all happens because she was 'looking out', because he run off to explore 'behind the stage', where people are not the assigned role - compare with the 'vanishing act' from the theater in the last minutes.If I was Tim Burton, I would break down and cry tears of joy, because this would be the film I've been trying all my life to make, and someone did it.This is good, Greenaway with genuine pathos.

Ah Young Love,"Directed by Wes Anderson Moonrise Kingdom follows the story of two young ""lovers"" an orphan Boy Scout name Sam and a Girl from a Dysfunctional family name Suzy. Who decide that their fed up with their life at home and run away together. Which ends up leading to a massive search that unravels affairs, rivalries and social services . Ever having that Anderson style the film is shot in very stunning cinematography. While not the most colorful of all his movie it still manages to propagate a vivid style. Some good shot of the water and the woods. The opening is So Reminence of the art style it looks like a doll house with miniatures but it's a set. The characters themselves are sort of a surpriseing bunch it's a great cast with some very familiar faces like Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Frances Mcdormand and Bruce Willis. They all give good performance though they don't get that much humor with the exception of Edward Norton as The scoutmaster. Bruce outright standout most. The strength of this film doesn't come from them but surprisingly the children. This is their movie they steal the show from Sam and Suzy both of them are troubled in their own way. They see the other as the thing missing,with that naïve way of thinking where they think they have it all planned. You expect them to just be failing from the get go, but surprisingly they don't really do that bad alone. Their relationship is also spot on that young love Mentality where they think they know how they really feel, but they're really just acting more on emotion. Speaking of love and marriage. The same time their moments together are both awkward and cute as it would probably be for any kid in that situation. The scene before and after they jump in the water cements that. However just every kid in this movie what really adds to the humor is how they don't really talk like normal kids but in some way young adults. The Boy Scouts themselves have sort of that 80s kid wiseass remarks, like something you see out of the goonies. Most of the highlights happen more in the first half the 2nd feel like it kinda slow down a bit. There's this one subplot involving Bruce& Frances Characters, but it doesn't really go anywhere as you would think. It's overall clear the director wanted the focus to be kept on the kids most of the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny sweet and poignant,"A beautiful, sweet movie, with lovely use of colour and framing, an engaging story and packed with memorable characters. The film has a lovely sun-baked tint to the film in the early stages. The style of the film is an interesting one, it has an abruptness to it which you will probably really like or really take against. The costumes, props and locations all help convey this being a story set in the past too. You do very much care for it's characters, Bruce Willis was surprisingly good in this actually. I enjoyed the music too and look forward to revisiting the movie again. I agree with others too than the film captures quite well that wonderful sense of lost innocence we all sort of still remember.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two misfit kids fall in love and decide to run away together.,"I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is Anderson's best film so far. The tone is consistent, the story is fun, and the characters have depth, particularly the two main characters, Sam and Suzy (the kids). (The quirkiness level has been handled with great restraint and is ""just right"" -- if things were more quirky I think the film would have spiraled out of control.) Visual themes I thought were interesting included ""size"" and intricate ""boxes within boxes."" For example, in one shot, three little kids play Parcheesi on the floor of their house; they are giants in the foreground. As they play, their father walks down a set of stairs and out a door -- he's tiny! This visual image develops story and plot as the kids are, in this story, more adult than the adults in many ways. Also, the opening sequence opens on a house, which looks like a doll house as we go from room to room -- and then eventually we see the same house as a painting within the house -- boxes within boxes. Very cool. I found the art direction to be quite wonderful.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The direction is excellent. The screenplay is awesome. The performances were marvelous. Bruce Willis, Tilda Swinton and Edward Norton were at their best, while the children were epic. I just cannot believe how this story went through me. It is the basic plot that I couldn't get along with, hence I give it lesser marks than anyone else who had seen and enjoyed this movie.Indeed this is a great effort taken by the team, so I appreciate what they have done. But frankly, it is not a movie I will watch again. I didn't have any problem while watching Little Miss Sunshine in the similar terms, hence I do not know why this movie was not digestible to me.

Wes Andersons worst film? it could well be,"Wes Andersons films in the order of how much i like them is as follows. 1)The royal tenenbaums 2) Bottle rocket 3) The Darjeeling limited 4) Life aquatic 5) Rushmore 6) Fantastic Mr fox 7) Moonrise kingdom (the list doesn't include any of Wes Andersons short films). Firstly, I don't understand why moonrise kingdom gets such good reviews. on rotten tomatoes it gets the highest critical approval of any of his films with 94% and the life aquatic gets the lowest with 53%. I am a huge fan of Wes Andersons style (which i would find very difficult to describe well) and his first five films are all almost perfect for what they are in my opinion. My problem with fantastic Mr fox but mainly Moonrise Kingdom is that he has almost taken his style too far and 'cringingly' overdone the whole 'Wes Andersonness' of it. Despite what i said before about his other films i think that this film is too perfect and too beautiful in an annoying and childish way. I must say however that the children acted very well and some of the scenes between them i found enjoyable. Aside from this the adult actors as highly talented as they are just don't suit a Wes Anderson film and the way are trying to act in a 'Wes Andersonny' way (sorry about all these made up words) really irritated me. I think he should go back to Owen Wilson as his co-writer and forget his last two films.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wes Anderson's best? No, I don't think so, but it's very enjoyable","A sweet little picture. It's Wes Anderson through and through, and if you are a fan, you'll like it a lot, I suspect. Set in the '60s, it concerns two pre-teens (Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) who conspire to run away together on an adventure on the remote island of New Penzance. Gilman, an orphan, is pursued by his fellow Khaki Scouts and their scoutmaster (Edward Norton). Hayward's parents, whose marriage is dissolving, are played by Bill Murray and Francis MacDormand. Bruce Willis plays the policeman on the island. Gilman and Hayward are adorable, but, God help me, by far my biggest problem with the film is that they are poor actors. Their love story is really touching, and it feels like it should be one for the ages, but the performances kept pushing me away. I just could not feel much for these kids, since they never seemed like real human beings, but rather like puppets controlled by Anderson above. The other Khaki Scouts, as well as Hayward's brothers, don't fare much better. The adult actors (also including, in minor roles, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel, Jason Schwartzman and Bob Balaban) are much better. Don't get me wrong, I quite enjoyed this film. Anderson's directorial flourishes are well known by now, but are just as impressive as ever (if you like his stuff, obviously). The cinematography and production design are wonderful. And, as always, Anderson's choice of music, most notably these strange music education recordings composed by Benjamin Britten, is impeccable. I was just ever so slightly disappointed. I suspect if you like the two lead performances, you may find this one of Anderson's very best.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Real characters for a change,"I am so tired of comic book caricatures: strong villains, impossible heroes and dependent sheep. I'm not saying I didn't like Batman; it was well done. I especially liked the new Spiderman, and not just for the 3D; it was updated nicely and the actors and action were superb. They were fun, like comic books, but how much do they matter?""Moonrise Kingdom"" is also fun, and will matter. Not to everyone mind you, but to a lot of us who are less than perfect and still doing a pretty good job keeping the wheels rolling in this crazy world.And to kids. Many, if not most kids know they are not pets to be trained by adults. They start early to shape their own space (you've heard of the ""terrible two's I'm sure). If you know any scouts, you might know that they are still doing an amazing job building competence, respect for others and teamwork. That's almost as hard as teaching math. They can solve real problems. They have an important level of competence.With that, the events here are energetic, strong, realistic and balanced, as well as engrossing, with a fast pace and sharp corners. It keeps you moving.Quirky characters? Yes, but not so different than most of us. We are all pretty unique after all and manage to stay positive even though the world is not the way we'd like it. It makes you smile inside to see how entertaining real characters can be if you relax and let them be.Most of all, there is a profound empathy going on here. That empathy is inside all of us. Lately, we have often set that aside in favor of angry divisiveness. Would it really be so bad for us to be more in contact with our innate empathy (not sympathy - that's different).Some think our very futures will be largely determined by our ability to empathize. This film makes me think that they may be right. It energizes persistence, competence, manliness, femininity, love and hope. It even makes us more able to defend ourselves.Thank you, Mr. Anderson and thanks to this amazing cast. Great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonrise Kingdom,"Moonrise Kingdom is the type of film that is beautiful and quite something to behold on several different levels. First off, the film looks amazing. It takes place in 1965 and with the wonderful cinematography of the film as well as the colour contrast they use for the buildings, sky, wilderness and so on, it all looks so beautiful and some scenes leap out at you almost because of their bright beautiful primary colours and others suggest a scene that may be more serious, or downplayed, but whatever the mood, or setting of said scene the film looks fantastic and certainly deserves a cinematography nomination among other things at next year's Academy Awards. The music of the film which mostly uses a lot of famous classical pieces such as Benjamin Britten, for example are all very beautiful and set the tone and feel of the film wonderfully as well. The film is actually quite concerned with music and it does have somewhat to do with the plot and the classical pieces among others that have been chosen for the film all sound beautiful and really create atmosphere and the moods and tones of each scene they are set in. So, Moonrise Kingdom is certainly a joy for the eyes with it's beautiful looking cinematography as well as production and art design and it also sounds great, but to say that is where the film stops on it's numerous levels of mass achievements would be totally unfair to the film and not giving credit where it is really due. The film about two young lovers who run away and the wonderfully eccentric townspeople who go looking for them has a lot more to it than what it may seem. Through the eyes of this young boy and girl (Sam and Suzy to be exact) we are somehow transported back to our own childhood and adolescent years and with great storytelling and character study we are able to connect and relate to these two young characters. Growing up everyone has their own story of their teenage years, their first love, their relationships with others, but the film does deal with some issues that should be universal and has hit all of us at one time, or another. Issues such as not belonging, or feeling like a misfit. You may be surrounded by all sorts of different peers and family members, but how many of them really get you as a person and can start a conversation, or even a friendship with you, or is it too difficult for them and also perhaps for you because of insecurities and differences of hobbies, interests and above all perception. When we are young we judge people by the clothes they wear, what they are into and all sort of superficial things that we later regret later on in life. However because of this we have often excluded and been the cause of hurt feelings and isolation to others. That is explored here. The dysfunctional relationships we can have with our parents where we may not always understand them and on the same topic they may not always understand you is developed here. However through it all, these two characters do connect and fall in love and start what is actually a very beautiful and endearing friendship. While the film could have been depressing, or another movie about today's so called ""lost youth"", the film takes a different direction by instead embracing and celebrating what not only makes these characters different among their peers, but with the adult characters as well. We start to understand them better and care for them and maybe we were too harsh to judge them at first alongside the actors who share screen time with them. The film is ultimately a wonderful feel good film and it's brimming with such wonderful originality and creativity, I think it would be hard for some not to like it. Yes, the film has a style and tone all of it's own, but is so uniquely different and wonderful, instead of criticizing it, let's celebrate and reward it for the originality on display here. The actors from young and old all do a terrific job here and overall Moonrise Kingdom, is terribly and wonderfully original and creative and has the power to remind us of our childhood and maybe can even help heal some of those wounds with it's beautiful and entertaining story.

Elemental.The film is even spot on in regards to the relative physical maturity of the kids. The girls is, like girls in general, about a year ahead in terms of physical maturity. Not to suggest that there is nudity or anything purile but only that it is strange to recall how within that span of about 12 months at that age a virtual metamorphosis occurs for adolescents.

Youth is Not Wasted on the Young. It's Abused by Adults,"The two lead kids are a curious, quirky revamping of Shakespeare's star-crossed adolescent lovers from Verona, but the inexorable obstacle thwarting Sam and Suzy's eternal union is not their feuding clans but the increasingly bizarre, malfunctioning society into which they've been born. The 60s in America were a time of drastic, profound social changes and 1965 was a year immediately on the threshold of some of the most drastic, most disorienting upheavals to the status quo. A generation of educated, financially advantaged, and chemically motivated young people were beginning to reject the many negative, outdated beliefs that afflicted the unsteady, faltering nation, and they did this by adopting radical new attitudes, fashions, and philosophies. They molded these into their personal arsenals of weapons of defiance, and would deploy them against the powers that be. Parents often were the most convenient and most deserving targets of the generational revolution, and this certainly is the case for the two precocious 'tweens here. Suzy's parents' disintegrating marriage is a potent catalyst in moving her to take moderately drastic action and escape to the far side of the mythically quaint New England island, New Penzance, along with the stoic, strange, but charming Sam, whose parents are guilty of the even more heinous and inexcusable injustice of having died and left him an unwanted orphan.Throughout the film there are plenty of subtle - very subtle - hints at the many classic stories from recent and distant history that deal with childhood traumas, triumphs, and treacheries, such as Lord of the Flies, Oliver Twist, The Tempest, Hamlet, The Hardy Boys, Old Yeller, Barn Burning, and many others. None of these sources is bluntly, crassly, overtly referenced or quoted. Rather, these many appropriate influences are only faintly detectable through the unquestionably clear, but curiously distorting prism of Wes Anderson's now exceptionally well developed cinematic method. Interestingly, all the well known literary antecedents from which Wes draws upon have been inverted - flipped on their heads - so that it's only by a very definite spinning around and turning inside out of the increasingly outlandish situations that we might guess and appreciate from whence it all comes. That's a hard feat to pull off even just once or twice in a movie, but Moonrise Kingdom is a jam packed solid 94 minute parade of exactly this trick. For example, in The Tempest Miranda is alone and isolated on a nearly deserted isle with her father and - like any creature inexperienced in the crass ways of the wider world - she naively assumes that all new visitors to her island posses hearts of gold. But Suzy, in the incessant company of only her younger three brothers, is shockingly sexually aware and sophisticated, or at least appears to be if you chose to judge her by her mod mini skirts and her lavish eye makeup and her brutally honest and sharp tongue. Another example of how the film cleverly compliments it's literary sources is the tightly militaristic coordination of Wes' khaki clad kids, which plays so nicely against our memories of the increasing ragged and savage shipwrecked gang in Lord of the Flies. The subtle contrast is made doubly resonant when, unlike the inhuman treatment dealt out to the incompetent misfit Piggy, Wes' clean cut, spotlessly uniformed scout troop - in spite of their well meaning but bumbling chain smoking troop leader played exquisitely by Ed Norton - independently conspires to heroically rescue the self ostracized Sam from the clutches of the nefarious adults in a brilliantly choreographed Seal Team 6 style maneuver. The deft allusions to literary teen dramas are here only to help us grasp just how upside down their world around them has gotten, and by implication, our world around us today. And then there's the spectacularly understated beach camp scenario with Sam and Suzy that develops into a preposterous spoof of that most ridiculous of all teen love fantasies, The Blue Lagoon. I bet almost nobody who has seen this film gets the joke, but I did and it's a touch of genius in an already superbly intelligent and genuinely funny film.Wes has made it look deceptively simple and natural, and therefor many viewers will likely miss the full brilliance of his masterful achievement. That's not to say that those possibly oblivious viewers won't enjoy his surprisingly nuanced and deeply satisfying fable; they just won't admire and cherish it and be raving about it as emphatically as I am. It's so confidently, and efficiently, and stylishly executed that all the sly nods to its cultural heritage finally are icing on a sincerely delicious and satiating cake.

Another Winner From Wes Anderson,"I have been a big fan of Wes Anderson's movies since the first time I watched him and the thing that I enjoy the most about a Wes Anderson film is that he always takes his situations, whether they are trivial or very big with huge stakes, and he makes a great adventure out of it with fantastically well written characters who are entertaining and who we will develop real feelings for. In this sense I think Moonrise Kingdom is his best movie yet and I do not say that lightly at all because as I said I love all of his movies (all the ones I have yet seen anyhow).This movie is about a boy named Sam, an orphaned boy who is at scout camp, and Suzy, a very misunderstood girl, who both decide to run away together. The young actors both do a commendable job. The rest of the cast are all people who are either trying to catch them to bring them back or helping them on their adventure in some way. Bruce Willis and Frances McDormand stand out as does Bill Murray who always tends to shine in all of Wes Anderson's movies.Do not miss this movie! If you like Wes Anderson's other movies at all this is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A+ A brilliant and unique story telling of coming of age,"After nearly a half a century of going to movies, there are so few movies I give anything over a 7, but this movie was one of the most unique story telling of coming of age in a very unique style. I loved it.It's humor and serious tones by kids, with a superb cast of adults made this a delightful romantic comedy, with enough drama to balance it out.It really was done brilliantly, and in such a style that didn't take anything from the story telling or from each character. The style alone was unique. People who didn't like this movie, or couldn't appreciate the style, humor, or story line, are probably content with just cgi action and rapid drama of suspense. There are too many fast food movies being made now, with the intent to appease the party line that doesn't require reflection or thought.I have never seen a style done this way, and rather than lengthy monologues, the quick and witty dialogue made it very enjoyable and entertaining.Wes Anderson should have done Jojo Rabbit, and if you can see the vision of his work, you know that it would have been brilliant too.This was an enjoyable, fun, humorous, and delightful movie, that doesn't come around often enough. Lots of coming of age movies, but this is one of those that is in a class all of it's own. Like Fantastic Mr. Fox, it was done in a way that is clever, funny, and brilliant.This will be added to one of my top favorite comedy-drama-romance movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Clever,"In 1965 on a fictional New England island, an outcast 12-year-old boy scout runs away with a local girl (also an outcast) which causes havoc in the small community.The story is simple and enjoyable with good moments of campy humour. The main credit for this film must go to director Wes Anderson. His use of camera movements and angles are very clever especially during the opening credits. He also directs each scene with an ironic attitude -sympathetic to the characters while being cheeky at the same time. The costumes and set decorations are also well chosen for this nostalgia trip.With a fine cast of well-known actors, this film is an enjoyable experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming & Delightful... Great family adventure movie,"Moonrise Kingdom – CATCH IT (A) Moonrise Kingdom is a breath of fresh air in mist of highly glamorous and commercializes Hollywood. There is very few family adventure movies are made these days. As no one has the time to work on their characters and bring something pure out of their heart but Moonrise Kingdom changes that and bring something so delightful that it's hard to imagine that it's a Hollywood movie.Moonrise Kingdom is set on an island off the coast of New England in the 1960s, as a young boy and girl fall in love they are moved to run away together. This shakes everything in a calm town where hardly any incident happens so various factions of the town mobilize to search for them and the town is turned upside down. Wes Anderson has directed a delightful, funny and intelligent movie which is beyond all typical clichés. It brings back the innocence of first love and to do anything for your first love.The performances by young newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward are simply great. Their non famous faces, innocence and curiosity bring freshness and honesty to the movie. Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman and all the scout kids are simply brilliant.It won't be wrong to say that Moonrise Kingdom is the most delightful, playful and innocent movie of 2012. There are very few movies which makes you feel good about life in general. Highly Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Elements but Results Unsteady,"As always, I was optimistic and curious going into a Wes Anderson film viewing. It employs many of his usual cast such as Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Ed Norton, Tilda Swinton, and Jason Schwartzman, plus a few new faces, specifically the two young leads. Everyone is talented and the kids do breathe some life into the proceedings. As for the usual adult cast, all of which are very talented, they and their characters just didn't create the depth of personality and interest required to make Moonrise Kingdom wholly engaging. I think it is due to a combination a weak script and direction. While watching Moonrise Kingdom I was liking what I was seeing visually but emotionally I just wasn't drawn in. Despite its shortcoming Moonrise Kingdom is still worth checking out if your curious.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

The deeper meaning I referred to above has to do with the context of the reasons why these pre-teens were troubled and how they overcame that, I won't spill anymore.

An affirmation of childhood,"Wes Anderson's latest film, Moonrise Kingdom, evokes a time when the simple experience of being alive filled us with wonder. Though Moonrise Kingdom is offbeat as only a Wes Anderson film can be, the expression of his individual style, whether it's called ""miniaturist"", ""quirky"" or something else, is a sincere and heartfelt counter to the homogenized product emanating from the Hollywood assembly line. Co-written by Roman Coppola and set on an island in New England in 1965, the film opens at Camp Ivanhoe where the Khaki Scouts are subject to their morning inspection by earnest Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton).It seems as if the Scouts are up to funny stuff such as building tree houses higher than the nearest angel. As the moving camera follows Ward on his daily routine, he discovers that 12-year-old Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman), an orphan who lives with his foster parents and has been labeled as ""emotionally disturbed,"" has ""flown the coop."" We find out that he has run away with young Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward), another unhappy camper who lives on the East Coast island of New Penzance in an upper-middle class home with her three younger brothers and two attorney parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). In a panning shot, the camera catches the Bishops in separate rooms as if each is living in their own universe, the mother communicating with her family by the use of a bullhorn.As shown in flashback, Sam and Suzy met a year ago when he barges into the girls dressing room during a school play and they have been writing letters to each other ever since, meticulously planning a ten-day run away to a remote part of the island. Though it is hard to see the attraction of a precocious (though expressionless) young woman who loves to read books to a smallish, young boy with thick glasses and a speech impediment, what people see in each other at any age, more often than not, does not fit our pictures.When the two fulfill their dream and find an isolated beach area known only as ""Mile 3.25 Tidal Inlet,"" they are pursued by a search team that includes Suzy's parents, the Scout Master (Norton) and his commanding officer (Harvey Keitel), the local police captain (Bruce Willis) who is having an affair with Suzy's mother, an-over the top Tilda Swinton, known only as Social Services, cousin Ben, a scam artist dressed as a scout (Jason Schwartzman), and Sam's deputized fellow scouts who eventually redirect their energies towards supporting Sam. With an approaching hurricane, everything that Sam has learned about wilderness survival will be put to the test in a very busy whirlwind finish.Moonrise Kingdom is not only played for laughs, though there are plenty of them. It also expresses a longing that may strike a responsive chord with those who have ever felt the sting of being different and isolated from others. Sam and Suzy's relationship is recognizably childlike without being marred by sentimentality or excessive cuteness, and we can believe that they love each other. When Suzy tells Sam that the idea of being an orphan is so appealing and romantic, with adult honesty he tells her ""I love you, but you don't know what you're talking about."" Wes Anderson knows what he is talking about and Moonrise Kingdom is an affirmation of childhood that, in an age of cynicism and uber-technology, reminds us all of what may have forgotten somewhere along the way.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Return to Genius From Wes Anderson?,"A pair of young lovers (Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman) flee their New England town, which causes a local search party to fan out and find them.Many directors have a certain stamp they leave on their films that make it clear who was responsible. I daresay that Wes Anderson more than any other director might be the master of the stamp. If his name appeared nowhere on this film, the colors, characters and quirky plot would just give it away. He makes the indie style mainstream.That being said, this is probably Anderson's best film in years. I cannot say I ever disliked any of his work, but ""Darjeeling Limited"" (for example) did not meet the expectations it should have. Here, we have the full Anderson experience: Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, a refreshing Ed Norton, and even Harvey Keitel (who seems to have faded away over the last decade). Bruce Willis was the weakest link, but luckily he was not crucial.A good deal of work went into the production: the creation of the maps, paintings, books and more. I assumed the books were real, and I assumed wrong. I thought it possible that the map was real, but it was not. So this is a credit to the art design crew -- they made the fictional realistic, which is no easy task.The film is nominated for Best Screenplay, and I think that is valid. On a surface level, it is a story of two outcasts and the innocence of young love. That alone makes a good story when told by the right people (as it is here). But then you add the second level, where the children are contrasted with the adults whose relationships have crumbled. We are not weighted down by their negativity, but are still fully aware of it. Perhaps the adults and children are a mirror to each other?The third level is one I am not completely sure how it fits or what it means, but I believe there must be some symbolism to the flood motif. The island is shown three days before a flood, and a play showing Noah's Flood is prominent. More so, Suzy Bishop plays the raven, which was the first bird Noah released to see if the flood had ended. Does it mean something that she was a raven and not the sparrow? I am not sure, but I think so.Some critics have listed this among the best films of 2012. I am not as confident. While certainly top 20, probably not top 10. But still well worth a view.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kingdom of Cinema,"Wes Anderson movies are always fun to watch. Films like Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and Fantastic Mr. Fox are all indie comedy gold that never failed to stir meaningful emotions as well as keeping one entertained and laughing. Now, Anderson delivers his crowning achievement with the sentimental and beautiful Moonrise Kingdom.The film follows the young couple of Sam and Suzy as they decide to run away together. They both have lives that are reminiscent of childhood— trying to fit in, being an outsider, and being continually frustrated by the seemingly idiotic world of adulthood. The adults, which include Suzy's parents, the local sheriff, and Sam's boy scout leader, all seem to occupy an absurd and cartoon world that seems shallow and lacking in the joys that the two main characters remain in touch with. The action takes place on an island community in 1965, which helps to create a majestic and beautiful world that the characters inhabit.The two stars are both newcomers. Jared Gilman is great as the awkward outsider Sam, and plays his role as if he were a 1960s movie star. Kara Hayward is phenomenal as Suzy, the troubled girl that runs off with Sam. Together they have marvelous chemistry that make their scenes almost spellbinding to watch. The grownups are just are all great to watch. Bill Murray and Frances McDormand play Suzy's parents. They are both hilarious, and also slightly tragic in their sour marriage. Bruce Willis plays the slightly dimwitted cop who takes control of the rescue party to find the two kids. Edward Norton highlights the movie as the overzealous and dopey boy scout master. There are other cameos in the film, all of which are delightful and welcome.Anderson has created a beautiful world that blends realism with surrealism. Many shots are classic Anderson, creating a scene that feels like a highly stylized stage play, while simultaneously taking full advantage of the art of the camera. Every single shot is beautiful, and helps to immerse the viewer in the world, the story, and the characters. Anderson also walks the thin line of indie comedies, and succeeds in not making any part of the film too depressing. Not that it isn't serious. The film's themes are as deep and meaningful as any drama about childhood—if not more so—and Anderson keeps the humor going throughout the entire adventure.Moonrise Kingdom is without a doubt Wes Anderson's best movie yet. The sentimental and romantic story is perfect, and the performances are all mesmerizing. Anderson makes references to many films from the 60's, an era that has obviously had huge influence over him. As a result, this magnum opus of a film is the best one this year.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not just an awesome trailer,Having seen the trailer I was sure that I would be in for a film that looked great but maybe at the expense of actual substance. However the characters and script are brilliant and the plot doesn't stray one bit. The running time is just about right as one of the film's strongest points is that it doesn't overcook anything meaning the comedic value and drama are not overstated. The other facet of the film's quality is the soundtrack which really imbues the film with the era in which it is set. It's actually quite annoying that the review has to be ten lines long as I have included everything that I feel relevant already and would rather have ended the review in the previous sentence as opposed to the one that I am writing now as I feel this is fault that should at some point in the future be rectified by whoever sanctions these reviews.,,Anonymous,Romance
Enid Blyton on Acid,"An interesting, entertaining, but not wholly satisfying movie.Anderson offers his take on what seems a very English postwar style of children's literature. With a supporting soundtrack that includes Benjamin Britten's The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra and a plot that includes the inclusion of Britten's Noye's Fludde, Anderson manages to reflect a very middle class English sensibility of the 1950s and 1960s. A quirky prepubescent love story, Moonrise Kingdom has some fine acting from its two lead actors, particularly the deadpan Kara Haywood as Suzy, who has no doubt kick started a a great future in the movies. The support cast is faultless; Willis, underrated as ever, is fantastic as the police captain, Norton takes on the role of Scoutmaster Ward with gusto, reminding us of his comedic abilities, and there's a great cameo from the wonderful Harvey Keitel.And Andersons realisation of the story is underpinned by the efforts of his regular cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman and art director Gerald Sullivan. We get the studied formal directing we have become used to from Anderson, and it works. Its a lovely movie to look at. Its big problem is that it's not as funny as Anderson obviously believes it is, quirky surrealism is not enough to carry a film. If its meant to be funny then the audience need to laugh. Its other problem is, as with all of Anderson's films that I have seen, that it it is stuck in a safe white middle class milieu, that reflects a world that perhaps Anderson wished existed and perhaps does for a significant wealthy, white, middle class group of people who can separate themselves from the uncomfortable realities of modern America.Entertaining and fun but hardly a classic of modern American cinema. Anderson ploughs his own furrow, one that is curiously annoying and rather unsatisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"": A Whimsical Tapestry of Youth and Rebellion","Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a film that unfolds like a whimsical tapestry, woven with threads of nostalgia, innocence, and the bittersweet tang of adolescence. It's a cinematic mosaic that captures the earnest pangs of first love with a precision that is both exacting and tender.Set against the backdrop of a New England island in the summer of 1965, the film follows the quixotic journey of two young runaways: Sam, an orphaned Khaki Scout, and Suzy, a disenchanted lighthouse keeper's daughter. Their pact to escape the adult world and its myriad disappointments is the heart around which the film beats, and Anderson captures their odyssey with a lens that is at once sympathetic and wryly observant.The island of New Penzance is a sepia-toned haven where the mundane rubs shoulders with the extraordinary. Anderson's signature style - meticulous framing, a saturated palette, and a camera that glides with the grace of a well-penned letter - is in full display. The director's world is one where every detail, from the books in Suzy's suitcase to the patches on Sam's uniform, tells a story.The ensemble cast is a marvel, with each actor delivering performances that resonate with authenticity. Bruce Willis's portrayal of the melancholic yet well-meaning Captain Sharp, Edward Norton's earnest Scout Master Ward, and Bill Murray's portrayal of Suzy's father, Walt Bishop, are all imbued with a pathos that is both humorous and heartrending. The young leads, Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, bring a precocious gravitas to their roles that belies their years, embodying the earnestness and the folly of youth with equal aplomb.Anderson's script, co-written with Roman Coppola, is a treasure trove of poignant moments and sharp dialogue. The film's humor is derived not from cheap gags but from the absurdity of life itself, the incongruities that emerge when the world of children collides with the world of adults. The narrative is a delicate balancing act between the farcical and the profound, a tightrope that Anderson walks with the confidence of a seasoned acrobat.At times, the film's meticulousness can feel overwrought, its quirkiness forced. There is a sense that Anderson's controlled universe leaves little room for the messiness of real life, that the characters are more archetypes than flesh-and-blood people. The film's pacing, too, occasionally meanders, losing the urgency that propels its young protagonists forward.While the film's aesthetic is undeniably enchanting, it can also serve as a barrier, distancing the viewer from the emotional core of the story. The very stylization that makes ""Moonrise Kingdom"" a visual feast also renders it somewhat inaccessible, its heart guarded by a veneer of artifice.""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a film that lingers in the mind, a testament to the enduring power of storytelling. It is a film that reminds us of the fleeting nature of childhood, the inevitable march towards adulthood, and the small, defiant acts of rebellion that make us who we are.""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a love letter to the misfits, the dreamers, and the restless spirits who find solace in the magic of cinema. It is a film that celebrates the triumphs and the tragedies of growing up, and does so with a grace that is all too rare in the medium. Wes Anderson has crafted a film that is both a paean to youth and a meditation on the passage of time, a cinematic experience that is as enriching as it is entertaining. And for that, it is a film that deserves to be cherished.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Ed Norton, Ed Norton, Ed Norton","I had entertained the notion of leaving my boyfriend, Hugh Jackman, for Ed Norton before I saw ""Moonrise Kingdom"", but now after seeing Eddie's brilliant Scoutmaster, I'm kicking Jackman to the curb as soon as I post this review.Quirky is right in my wheelhouse (as we say an awful lot lately)....I get whimsical, I embrace wit and playfulness. So it may surprise people to hear that I'm disappointed with Andersen's latest film. I've been looking forward to it forever, saw it with a favorite person and even snuck in our favorite snacks, but meh.The artful touches were delightful like set decoration and shot composition. Inspired even. But the whole thing was impossible to hear. The score, basically Benjamin Briton, completely overwhelmed much of the dialogue, especially the mumbling young lovers. It was fun to watch, but torture to hear, or not hear, which is the main point. I needed subtitles, and I am someone who understood almost every syllable in ""The Full Monty"".Ed Norton, my next beau, was exceptionally amusing and I can't wait to discuss his fine performance in depth with him.

The situational humor somewhat a disappointment,"I am an avid Wes Anderson fan and have loved all of his movies. For me the thing I love about his movies is the quirkiness of the scenes. The seemingly unintended humor, which of course is completely intended by the director. The sheer stupidity of the scenes for me is something I cannot resist. Its resembles watching a normal movie while high, except with Anderson you don't need to be high.Moonrise Kingdom did have the quirkiness, but I think that here the story and the setting were the major thing. I mean when you have children they are naturally quirky in some ways, you can expect stupid behavior of them. So I think having the main protagonists be children was a bad call. Also I felt that the quirkiness wasn't as quirky as it could've been. I mean in the other movies the quirkiness has been completely uncalled for, but here it fit the story etc. So its power was not as great. I mean there were few scenes where it totally worked, like the romantic scenes between the children but other than that it wasn't as good as it would've been with adults. For the first 30minutes I found myself thinking ""is this it?"".I went in expecting to see absolute quirkiness, what I got was a lovable story, goofy settings and some quirkiness. So if you like Andersons movies because of the funny setting and the cute story this is your movie. But if you want the humor and nothing but the humor this is not his best.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sweet and entertaining,"If you know Wes Anderson's movies, you know the feel of his movies: sweet, innocent, light-hearted, funny yet emotional. Moonrise Kingdom is no exception. A story which could have been awkward and become mired in emotional navel-gazing, moves along at a brisk pace. The subtle humour is there, the emotion is there, the innocence is there. Just when you think it has reached a place where it is going to drift for the rest of the movie, the story veers away to chart new territory.Great performances by the all-star adult cast: Bill Murray (wouldn't be a Wes Anderson movie without him!), Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, with minor appearances by Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel and Jason Schwartzman. The kids in the lead roles - Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward - are OK, but not great.

Not bad. Or good. Not a must-see. Or a total waste of time.,"I haven't watched all of Anderson's movies - and judging by this, it will take a lot time until I have patience again to watch another one. I get it that this is his style, and I do think that he's quite good at establishing beautiful frames, with all the colors, the positions of objects and characters and so on... But first, if he does the same thing on every movie, I don't think it should be called ""a style"" - more like laziness, or auto-plagiarism. Use your cash and connections to do something new, Mr. Anderson. Second, other than the previously- mentioned beautiful shots, his movies are just annoying. Annoying and sick - and not funny sick, or silly sick like say Cheech & Chong, just plain sick, weird and annoying. His mind (or like his fans would say, ""his genius"") clearly shows on every movie of his I've seen, and I'm pretty disturbed about how it looks like inside his head. Disturbed and kind of angry - I'm not a violent person, but his face does seem like it is begging for a punch.I get the appeal and why so many people love his work, or rather people love to say they love his work, because that makes them feel like they're somehow ""artsy"". While I applaud Anderson's (and Tim Burton's for that matter) attempts at doing better cinema in a Hollywood with way too much Transformers and Vin Diesel, one thing they could learn from other countries is that you don't have to put art on every single frame of a movie to make it a good motion picture. Anderson and Burton always do that, and many times their movies still suck. Simple is beautiful, often. They try too hard and come out as desperate, as if they won't be happy until everyone thinks they're stylish and cool. And being this needy is definitely not cool. What makes Tarantino looks cooler than both Burton and Anderson is that he acknowledges that his ""style"" is a bit stupid, so he doesn't take himself too seriously. This kind of detachment from oneself is the epitome of cool - too bad even Quentin falls for the self-aggrandizing trap now and then (see Inglorious Basterds).Anyways, this is nobody's business. I'm just venting because it pisses me off how pretentious these guys are, and the fact that great actors like Bill Murray fall for it. I would rather watch fifty movies from unknown new directors, before I give these guys another try. Good for them that so many people will run to watch everything they do. But I know exactly what to expect from them and quite frankly, I'm not a big fan.And it's a bit sad that so many people like it or pretend to like it. What a crazy effed up world we live in. Hopefully Wes Anderson will eventually let go of all this supposedly highbrow art cinema, and actually write a good plot for a change. Otherwise, he should just take his superior taste for shooting beautiful settings and become a painter. At least with paintings I get to decide for how long I want to stare at them and walk away when I get bored of it. Two hours of over-the-top cinematography, sound, characters and costumes is just too long.This movie is bad enough that writing this review of it was way more fun than watching it. And to all Anderson's fans - you may think you're smart because you like this, and you might even be actually smart. But there's definitely something wrong with you, and I'm worried about it. Please seek help before you do something stupid, like sharing your opinions to sane people.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
(Very) old-fashioned comedy,"Whenever I see a movie that I truly admire I always like to look at the most negative IMDb reviews before posting my own. In the case of Moonrise Kingdom it is apparent that Wes Anderson is very much an acquired taste. Many of our greatest artists are.It's interesting to see so many people who don't regard this as a comedy simply because (it seems) it isn't paced like a Judd Apatow movie. Without trying to sound too pretentious, Moonrise Kingdom is a comedy in the Shakespearean sense: more Midsummer Night's Dream than The Hangover.Anderson has an extraordinary ability to turn the most mundane subject matter into a magical, even mystical experience. The story here is simple, but the treatment captivates the viewer (well, many of us anyway) because he approaches the story with such a unique combination of innocence and style. Every shot in Moonrise Kingdom is designed to dazzle us visually. Yes, it is calculated and the acting can appear stilted, but there is simply no one in modern cinema whose vision is as clear-headed.In some ways Anderson is to comedy what Hitchcock is to the suspense genre. Every frame (or pixel) is the emanation of a unique personality. We should be grateful that there remains a place for such filmmakers in a world where individualism has a difficult path.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not everyone's movie, but a good one","""Moonrise Kingdom"" isn't for everybody, it's not one of those dumbed down children's comedies with elements of mini-tragedy - ""The Hobbit"", ""How to Train Your Dragon"", etc. It's like the old ones I used to watch when I was a kid - the film quality, the soundtrack and the rest of the atmosphere were nostalgic (reminded a bit of the original ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" movie), but the content is much more mature and darker.This is not a film that's likely to leave a deep impact; like American Beauty and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind did to me. Yet I believe in a couple of decades I'll have a nostalgic urge to watch it again. And it doesn't mean I'm not gonna watch it again tomorrow. Not at all.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"This is a very touching story, about a couple kids care for each other.","I decided to watch this movie on primarily because two of the stars in it are Bill Murray, and Bruce Willis, and it classified as a comedy. I have to say that while it is a comedy it's not a wild crazy one like Groundhog Day. This is a bit funny, but it's also a very touching story about a couple kids in 1965, that have troubles in their lives and find each other. Then they become friends and help each other deal with those feelings a bit, and greatly care for each other. And in the end they have totally found ways to deal with their problems and are totally happy being long time friends without all the problems and bad feelings that have at the beginning. I totally love this movie more for the facts of life it tells us about then the comedy of it. I recommend it to anyone to likes movies that help to teach people about facts of life and dealing with problems in life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Summer in youth,"There is something so unique and distinct about how Wes makes a caricature out of everything in his films to better show subtle emotions & feelings. To show the world in its absolute absurdity to better explain the subjective nature of life and how silly it sometimes is.There has always been something childlike about that style, something nostalgic. And in Moonrise Kingdom, that style has found its match in a story of first love. It took me back to the same feelings one would feel at 13, head over heals for their first crush, and how at that moment in time you could do anything.This story is youth eternal, and it warms my heart to remember.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wes Anderson's Best Film by Far,"Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom is a funny yet weird story about love. To start it off, when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked liked a waste of time. Well...I was wrong, thankfully. A story that at first glance may seem very childish and boring, is really a hilarious adventure that will keep you laughing. I really liked this movie, and I feel its Wes Anderson's best film yet. I felt that the acting in this movie was perfect for the style and tone of the film. I will say that I think Edward Norton's acting was the best in the film. Every time he came on the screen, I couldn't help but laugh at him. The film overall was hilarious. I didn't think I was going to laugh that much when seeing this film. Anything from the oddly placed ""cuss"" words (yes I put a Fantastic Mr. Fox joke in there!) to the Narrator who just seems to randomly appear in this film for no reason what so ever. Moonrise Kingdom isn't afraid to make you laugh, but at the same time, it has a classy feeling to it. This was by far my surprise movie of the summer. All in all Moonrise Kingdom is a hilarious adventure that is worth reliving. Wes Anderson's best film so far.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Emperor's New Clothes,"This is the first film of the year to which I give one star. I cannot believe the misleading hype by Wes Anderson fans and film critics this film is getting. I sat there for 90 minutes and I did not laugh once, and this was supposed to be a comedy (I only noticed about 4 people laughing in a pretty full theater). The famous adult actors were cardboard cartoons. They appeared to do one day's work and pick up a fat paycheck. This is the worse acting that Willis, Norton, Mc Dormand. and Murray have ever done. The two kids were good, but their lines never resembled anything kids would actually ever say to one another. In short, this movie is for Wes Anderson fans only. Other people best stay away from this stink bomb!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Not quite Anderson's best, but lovely all the same.","Moonrise Kingdom is a very Wes Anderson lovers-on-the-lam movie, as two emotionally disturbed 12-year-olds head for the hills, with a scout troop, a cop, social services (Tilda Swinton) and a couple of parents on their tail. After the baffling miscue that was Fantastic Mr. Fox, Anderson resumes his run of deadpan, dead-on films about damaged souls with this poignant portrait of loneliness and love. The first half is absolutely wonderful, full of lovely jokes and the director's usual off-kilter sentimentality, and if the second half can't match it - becoming too bitty, as well as curiously claustrophobic and small-scale at its supposed climax - it's still a very entertaining, amusing and affecting film. The familiar fonts, distinctive musical selections (Benjamin Britten and Hank Williams) and sad-faced protagonists are all present and correct, so if you like Anderson's (non-animated) films, you'll like it. If you don't, you won't. If you like some of them and not others, then you're weird and I don't understand you.",,Anonymous,Romance
An unfortunate slip up from one of America's most talented directors,"Title: An unfortunate slip up from one of America's most talented directorsWes Anderson is probably the best writer/director working today. Every three to four years he releases another cinematic masterpiece for us to pour our hearts to. Yet, for all those masterpieces you expect him to stumble once. Enter Moonrise Kingdom, a middling film that temporarily brings Anderson down from the highest heavens.Set during the summer of 1965 in New England, Moonrise Kingdom tells the tale of Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward), two young lovers trying to get away from it all. Sam is an exceptional scout in Troop 155, but also holds the honor of being ""the most unpopular scout."" Suzy is a dreamer who wants to escape from her misunderstanding parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and set out to do her own thing. The two kids have been pen pals for quite some time and plan to run away together. Once their plan is put into action, the island is sent into a frenzy as the adults try and track down the missing kids.The biggest, and unexpected, problem the film has is with its main characters and story. Anderson's stories are naturally perverse and offbeat, but they work because of their ability to tug at your heart all the way through. I didn't feel any of that here. The central love story between Sam and Suzy was just too weird and bland. Nothing about it made we want to care or keep watching. The kids themselves are not good characters, coming off as too one dimensional.The film also has another big problem, one that Anderson has been struggling with his whole career. All of his films are at their best in the first act, and then slowly get a little bit worse as time goes on. In most of his films like The Royal Tenenbaums and The Grand Budapest Hotel, it's alright since they're still really good even at their worst. This film, however, dips further down than others, ending in a sub-par fashion that soured my experience. This was caused by having too many subplots and the entire main plot being too melodramatic to be believable.This is very much a film for adults, even though the two main characters are kids. People who watch this film will most likely be reminded of a time when they were a feisty (and obnoxious) preteen who just wanted to get away from everybody. It's an age-old story of adolescence and youthful revolt, but its one that never goes out of style.Just like every other Anderson film, the camerawork is exceptionally done with trademark precision. Anderson and Yeoman use their patented symmetrical style to focus our attention on the middle of the frame. It will and always has been one of Anderson's best features since it allows for the film be fast paced and heavy in details without being excessive.The production quality is also well done. The houses and island itself are put together with respect to the time period and also the theme of the film. Light colors are heavily used along with bright light from the outdoors, which help us connect with the summer world and all its beauty.The acting here is mostly all very good apart with only a few people being just okay. Gilman and Hayward do a good job with the challenging material. They convey great emotion and do their to save their characters. McDormand, Murray, and Ed Norton play backup as the scurrying adults. They each get their time to shine and deliver in full. Special props to Norton as his character is the most fun to watch.Bruce Willis, Jason Schwartzman, and Tilda Swinton all underperform here. Both Swinton and Schwartzman have done better for Anderson, and Willis just doesn't do enough to be memorable.Moonrise Kingdom is a film that showcases what happens to a director when they rely too much on what they do best. Apart from having brilliant production quality and sound acting, Anderson's film doesn't have much going for it. While it is a dip in form for Anderson, it's nothing to worry about since we can still say he has never made a bad film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Who are these movies for?,"I enjoyed it, as weird as it is, because I also ran away from home as a kid and it was somewhat relatable.But still, it's a weird mix of dark themes, faint comedy, children clearly written by adults to act like adults... I don't understand who the audience is - it's definitely not a movie I would recommend for kids, or even early teens.But it's just quirky enough and in my case - relatable enough for me to enjoy it, so... I can't really find any big faults with it, except its weirdness and not-great acting. The kids were cute and the cast was strong - Bruise Willis, Edward Norton, the guy from Ghostbusters who never seems to be trying very hard, but... yeah... If you've seen Malcolm in The Middle - now that's great acting all-around, from both kids and adults, but this... well... it's okay acting.But overall, an enjoyable, weird adventure with no target audience. It brought a smile to my face many times.It has refreshing, positive themes too, that you don't see in movies these days, a lot of ""faith in humanity restored"" moments. So yeah. I liked it.I'm willing to accept that this movie is probably more broadly relatable than I think it is. Still not sure whom to recommend it to, though.

"An awkward sophistication, with small(er) parts played by great(er) actors","I have seen most of Wes Anderson's movies and I find them good at least, if not more. The plots themselves are usually not so holistic, but the characters and developments are pleasantly strange and make you giggle. Regarding this, the Coen brothers, Tarantino and Anderson seem to share similar values, but the latter is least violent.The characters and their performers are just great, including all known versatile Hollywood names beginning with Harvey Keitel and finishing with Jason Schwartzman... And female characters are stronger than male ones. The children are also well selected, including the main stars Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman, whose appearance and depiction of adult issues is natural, without moralizing or political correctness too often visible in Western movies involving minors.Through splendid roles and performances, Anderson laughs at lawyer language, foster care, local police, camp routines etc, but the stereotypes and clichés are funny and edifying, not annoying. Recommended to those fond of head-over-heels world and different approaches, but is a movie for like-minded, rather than a family movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
The quirky world of Wes Anderson,"Starting with dream-like visual thanks to the bright colour pallet, quick filming style and framing, Moonrise Kingdom is the latest film to come from the strange world of Wes Anderson that should delight fans and most newcomers to his work.On the New England island of New Penzance, this quirky 1965 set adventure tells the story of two 12-year-olds, orphan Sam Shakusky (Jared Gilman) and the troubled Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward), two runaways who try to escape their dysfunctional lives. As their friendship and romance starts to bloom the island's police chief, Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) leads a search with Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton), Suzy's lawyers parents (Bill Murphy and Frances McDormand), and a troop of boy scouts to find the wayward youths as the film becomes more and more surreal and provides plenty of what the hell moments.There will be people who would be hostile to Anderson's work and style, but Moonrise Kingdom should still be able to entertain the majority of filmgoers because of the excellent screenplay that provides a touching story, witty characters, and excellent jokes. The witty dialogue was enhanced by great performances, particularly from Willis and Norton who both have engaging screen presence.Anderson's gives us a technically wonderful film that uses tracking shots to keep the flow of the comedy going as foreground and background gags are presents. There are beautifully framed shots of the actors when the character is focused on them and long takes to maximise the performances. The cinematography of wide shots, the locations, and set design helps adds to the surrealism of this world and some of the more whimsical scenes as the children adventure into the wild.Moonrise Kingdom is lead by two first time child actors and they do a fine job; both Gilman and Hayward should go far in acting if they choose to continue. Moonrise Kingdom is a typical story about two outsiders who embark on a unusual friendship that becomes a more adult romantic one in nature. Be warned, there will be semi-naked prepubescent children on screen, which add creepiness to proceedings. The film would have failed if Gilman and Hayward were not compelling performers, but they were up to the job.Both children come from dysfunctional backgrounds, a continuous theme of Anderson films. Sam is an orphan who is describe as emotionally disturbed but even though he is a little eccentric, he is a decent kid and for the most part it is just a case of a boy's situation forcing a label on him. His former parents were selfish, passing the buck because they did not know how to deal with Sam.On the other hand, Suzy is from a well-off middle class family, yet she is the one with emotional issues, ranging from being cold and distance to a willingness to use violence. She is a product of her environment because her parents hardly communicate with each other except for legal speak and use megaphones to round up the children. Suzy is of course going to act out in an environment like this. It is an illustration that problems involving childhood exist in the middle classes and that parents over complicate the issue instead of tackling it head one.The parents and guardians are selfish, only caring about themselves instead of the children. Anderson uses Tilda Swinton's character to take satirical swipes at Social Services who look at a child's file more then the child themselves. The adults argue and fall into an anarchical state, even Willis and Norton who play the more likable of the adult characters are still faulted in their actions, lives, and/or abilities.Throughout the majority of the film is the percussion heavy music in the background that keeps up the tempo and rarely stops. It gives the film a more dramatic tone as the action builds up; it sometimes gives a western feel as the children survive in the wild or tension during the various chases the children endure.Moonrise Kingdom is a strange and surreal experience that will provide smiles and chuckles when you are soaked into Anderson's weird world. It will appeal mostly to Anderson's loyal fans, but there is still enough material in the film for non-fans to enjoy as we examine an unusual friendship.Please visit www.playeraffinity.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

First love and big adventures in a larger-than-life story (in a typical Wes Anderson summer camp),"Wes Anderson made this film from the perspective of (I'm guessing) his 12- year old self. First love and big adventures in a larger-than-life story, set in and around a New England island scout camp.Everything is very.. well pronounced is probably the right word, full of contrasts and slightly distant. Some nice big actors in charming small roles, but eventually the film revolves around 2 12-year olds. And drenched in classical music.It has the charm of your (or anyone's really) most endearing and cherished memories of that time when most of life was still waiting to be figured out, but some things were o so clear at the same time. I didn't really know how I felt back then anymore, and this film is a nice reminder!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Loved the element of comedy and the angle of love in the story. I thought about quitting the film when i was 20 minutes in, But i waited and thank god i did that because it was totally worth it to finish the whole movie. I feel like the story may have been executed more smoother and could've been made more understanding at the start of the film too. But i guess that was not the vision of the director. I would definitely recommend to watch this movie, it's one hell of an experience!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonrise Kingdom is a sweet heartwarming coming-of-age comedic drama that showcases some great talent.,"That talent mostly being Wes Anderson who has crafted an authentic drama with some contemporary flavours. His direction is so quirky that it's hard not to fall in love with it. The centralisation of characters and objects with the camera, the still shots of the excellent production design, the side track panning as characters walk along and a nice 360 degree scene within a house. The stages built for those scenes just ooze design excellence and I have to admire the simplicity. We follow two 12 year olds who fall in love and plan to run away, but various authorities attempt to track them down. It's a basic plot but the animated characters and young performances help reinvigorate this exhausted genre. Our typical Anderson cast (Norton, Swinton, Keitel, Murray etc.) are all here again and give great performances. The awkward yet loving chemistry between our two young leads was moulded with care and tenderness that I found somewhat relatable. I'm sure back in our youth we all fell in love with a crush and wanted to run away from everyone...no? Just me then. Again, the production design was genius. I love how it purposefully look like it's built for a stage show as opposed to a cinematic piece, there is something so idiosyncratic about Anderson's choice of style that just makes it wonderful. Whilst all the above is all plain sailing, my major issue was with the narrative. I found myself somewhat disengaged until about halfway through. Right from the start, you are thrown in straight away with about 47 characters (completely accurate...) and a geography lesson of the island. Honestly I needed to get a notebook out. It was intimidating! Like an onslaught of quirkiness. It took so long for me to catch up and become invested that the short runtime of 94 minutes was nearly over. It's a shame, wish it was longer so that the plot development could take its time. However, it's a sweet film and Anderson's style is impeccable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It'll make you laugh, it'll make you root for the two runaways, it'll make you feel good about humanity (for once at least). It's one of those fairy tales that deserve to be true and at the very least be filmed by Hollywood ;) In the end, every good review should just make you want to watch a movie that is great without spoiling much, if anything at all.

Nothing Special,"I initially heard about Moonrise Kingdom through a friend, and it was on Netflix so I thought ""What the heck? I've got nothing better to do"". I thought it was just a below average movie.Moonrise Kingdom doesn't feature any particularly good acting, despite the big names who were in the movie. They aren't major characters, so they didn't feel like anything special. The main actors were just okay. Sure, they're child actors, but I really don't see that as an excuse for poor acting. However, I never said they were bad. They were just okay.The plot itself doesn't feel like anything special, and the progression of it really wasn't that great either. The ending I felt was incredibly forced, and if Burton had just shaved off the last half an hour or so I think I'd have enjoyed it a little more.What I did like was the style of the movie. Older movies have a very appealing charm, and Moonrise Kingdom manages to capture that perfectly. But it's not like it's all that impressive, considering how easy and inexpensive it is.Overall, Moonrise Kingdom was just a below average movie. Although it had an appealing visual style, the plot was lacking, the acting wasn't anything special, and the ending felt unnecessary. If you did enjoy this movie, then go ahead.

Moon Rise Kingdome: Movie Review,"""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a movie about two misfit teenagers who fall in love and decide to run away, which causes the small island town to search for them. The movie puts the audience right in the action from the very beginning of the movie and slowly fills in the missing pieces. It is a hilarious adventure which seems somber in its demeanour but its comedic flair provides intense roller-coaster moments. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" has an ensemble cast of Oscar nominees and winner, starring Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murry, and Oscar winners Tilda Swinton and Frances McDormand. Wes Andersondoes a wonderful job combining a powerhouse cast without discriminating or overshadowing the two up-and- coming protagonists; Jared Gilman (as Sam) and Kara Hayward (as Suzy), who carried the movie superbly on their own. It doesn't feel for a moment that the movie needs the big stars but it is always great to see good actors doing what they do best.""Moonrise Kingdom"" does not go in great details about the lives of each character, but gives just enough information to get an understanding about their lives. This works in favour of the movie as it leaves it to the audience to establish a back story for each character. Essentially, each character is somewhat melancholic which creates a depressing atmosphere for the movie.Apart from few 'over the top' moments that take away from the crucial viewing-experience, this movie is an absolute delight. The chemistry between Gilman and Hayward has one rooting for the oddball lovers the entire duration of the movie. Their love feels genuine and is a welcoming change from Hollywood's manufactured teen romances, which are delusional, forced and unrealistic. Real life teenagers are supposed to be a little weird, confused, disillusioned, and above all they do not look like they just came out of a catalogue.""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a hilarious adventure that is exciting, original, shocking (no pun intended), and oddly depressing at times. Ultimately it is an immersing experience that does not and will not disappoint. The story of true love facing adversity in a very unusual setting is thoroughly satisfying and a must-watch!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
What you would imagine Wes Anderson would do in 2012,"The year is 1965, and the residents of New Penzance, an island off the coast of New England, inhabit a community that seems untouched by some of the bad things going on in the rest of the world.

But a violent storm is approaching the island, forcing a group of quirky adults (Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray) to mobilize a search party and find the youths before calamity strikes.As I was preparing for this review, I read many old reviews that hailed ""Moonrise Kingdom"" as the best Wes Anderson movie ever, praising his revolutionary and interesting style. However, now that we've seen newer Anderson movies, this one feels slightly lower in class compared to the newer ones. Nevertheless, it was a pretty fun watch. The movie is funny and entertaining, especially with the solid performances from the younger cast.It was also nice to see Bruce Willis, known for his strong and intense roles, portraying a very charming character in a Wes Anderson movie.

Murray and Schwartzman have worked with Anderson on several films as the Royal Tennabaums, Fantastic Mr Fox, The Life Aquatic and The Darjeeling Limited.

"Laugh Out Loud, Yet Still Art","I know my review will add nothing that hasn't been said before, but I hope to leave a brief review to convince you and your friends to see this movie, rather film.Moonrise Kingdom is many things at once. It is a laugh out loud comedy. It is filled with deadpan performances and snappy dialog of the 1930s kind, although a few characters show anger in places. It is a work of art in the sense that every scene is framed perfectly. I liken it to a gallery of portraits and a few landscape paintings that move. It has a good story that moves along at a good pace. It is also heartwarming, but not in an earnest, saccharin, true-life-TV- movie way. Nor is it nostalgic.In addition Moonrise Kingdom has elements that reached me on a personal level. Anyone who has scrambled in the woods and coast of southern and eastern New England will know the landscape in this film like an old friend. More personal still, as a coincidence my mother's name gets a fleeting mention, and I wear patchwork madras trousers, as does Bill Murray. You will find an element, however fleeting, that resonates.In short, if you are reading this review to decide to watch Moonrise Kingdom at any time, in any format, you will not be disappointed.

"Refreshing, Entertaining, Delightful - Wes Anderson in top form here.","""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a signature Wes Anderson movie. In look and feel, it comes quite close to his earlier work, ""The Royal Tenenbaums"". However, at times I was also reminded of ""Submarine"" that wonderfully precocious work from British director Richard Ayoade where a 15 year old's sole objective is to lose his virginity before his next birthday.""Moonrise Kingdom"" is strewn with classic Anderson characters; troubled but endearingly flawed adults, dysfunctional but intelligent kids (not the irritatingly faux cute Bollywood variety), poignant portrayals of wealthy and working class people generously infused with wry, dry humor. Overall a charming mix of quirk and cool. No scope for melodrama here.The highlight of Anderson movies as with ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is cinematography, background score and restrained acting.Each scene shot by Robert Yeoman is elegantly composed and aesthetically shot, mostly in primary colors. Alexandre Desplat's original background score mixes folk music, classic and rock seamlessly. Viewers also get a crash course in music appreciation during the opening and closing scenes of the movie.Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward (a very tempting mix of Emma Watson and Kristen Stewart) in the leading role of 12 year olds madly in love with each other are completely believable. Ensemble cast of Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDoirmand, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel and Jason Schwartzman complete the list of oddballs, weirdos, wackos and misfits inhabiting the fragile world of adolescents.So go right ahead and immerse yourself and you would come out refreshed, provoked, moved, entertained and delighted.

"Bursting at the seams with creativity, wit, and charm.","Moonrise Kingdom tells the story of two troubled, misunderstood kids who meet and bond over their inability to fit in. It's certainly not a revolutionary plot, but this movie is anything but run-of-the-mill. Quite the opposite actually – it's fantastic. Equal parts quirky, charming, witty, and genuinely funny, it's a deft and completely distinctive rendition of this well-worn tale.There're just so many great things to say about this film. Right from the opening credits it establishes a very unique tone with the musical selection, setting, and (most notably) the camera-work. The cinematography remains consistently amazing throughout the movie, utilizing really creative, often symmetrical shot compositions and lots of side-tracking pans. The visuals play an integral role in setting the off-kilter and playful atmosphere of the film (think Fantastic Mr. Fox, Wes Anderson's last film).The cast is also excellent across the board, and what's really impressive is that the two child leads manage to steal the show from huge names like Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, and Bill Murray. And the success of the two leads isn't just due to acting ability, it's also simply because the characters are really well-crafted and endearing. They both have an unabashed eccentricity and deadpan humor (think Napoleon Dynamite) that just makes them very likable and easy to root for. The deadpan humor is also a very integral part of the success of the film. There's definitely a serious message here about never compromising who you are to fit in with crowd, but it's delivered in a very light-hearted, good-humored way that never takes itself too seriously.Overall, Moonrise Kingdom is a movie that gets nearly everything right. It's a movie during which you just can't help but smile from beginning to end and which is bursting at the seams with creativity, wit, and charm. The only real criticisms I can muster is that the middle third drags just a tad and that I wish there was a bit more resolution with Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (the parent characters of the female lead). Aside from these minor quibbles though, the movie impresses on every level and is a thoroughly entertaining and heartwarming affair.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Enchanting Music Lesson and More...,"Once again... a surprise! Actors that were never my favourites: Bruce Willis is very likable in this film, and Bill Murray is passable in this one. And of course Jared Gilman(Sam) and Kara Hayward (Suzy) were very good. Edward Norton never seizes to amaze me with his capacity to really get into the character he acts. The photography is beautiful, and what's more it is suitable for the whole family. Children are actually the stars in this story! They merely allow some grownups some participation.What is the most enjoyable in this film are the music and the opportunity for children to learn about music and orchestral instruments. This was the reason I gave the film 9 points! Then I read the award history and lo and behold it did receive an award for the use of music in a film.Of course the story is not totally believable...I don't think social workers behave the way it appears in this movie....but since it is supposed to be a comedy I guess they thought they had to include some preposterous situations. The film is not exactly a comedy, nor strictly a children's movie, or a classic legend, but feels as if it is, with the help of the narrator, and the actual stories read by Suzy (Kara Hayward).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's tremendously quirky and strange but absolutely delightful.,"I can honestly say I knew nothing about this movie before seeing it and the name Wes Anderson means nothing to me. Having said that, I truly enjoyed this film.Movies like this really should be released more in the summer months. It's a complete pallet cleanser from all the big CGI stuff that hits during blockbuster season. It's tremendously quirky and strange but absolutely delightful. There's no doubt it requires patience to view because I honestly didn't know what to think of it for the first 15 or 20 minutes. Wanting to see where this superb cast would pop up in what amounts to a kids film kept me interested but the overall tone and story swept me away. There really are some stunning camera angles and visuals on display all the way through. There's a warmth to the cartoony and bizarre story that I found to be very appealing and there were many moments where I caught myself smiling as I watched.",,Anonymous,Romance
"window into our childhood, in the shape of this heartwarming coming of age film","So precise and uplifting it has to be alien, but yet so raw and heart aching, it can't be anything, but human. Writer/director Wes Anderson's takes us down a picturesque; autumn, country side road into our youths. A cinematic time machine that propels us back in time, to a simpler land, where peace and tranquillity run supreme. 1965 is the year that moonrise kingdom takes places, a warm and enchanting coming of age fairy tale, where love can brings together two lonely 12 year old misfits, one being a smart, awkward and resourceful scout, the other is a deadpan girl with anger issues, as they set out to take on the world. Whilst coming out the other side, smelling of roses and with no sign of heat break in sight. But not all goes to plan, due to them running away; they soon have to escape the ever-advancing arm of the law, in the form of scout matter Ed Norton and local officer Bruce Willis. But during this whirlwind of chaos, a violent storm threatens to change the lives of the entire sleepy inhabitance of New England forever.I would go as far as to say that Wes Anderson is an artist, as every scene is painted with rich, vibrant and bright textures, which light up the scene. Injecting a hint of magic into the air. Which I thought perfectly represents the innocents and vivacious quality of the two child main actors. Stylistically, many can draw comparison to Royal Tenenbaums, a film directed by none other than Wes Anderson with a similar feel, including misfits and dysfunction characters wading through life with dry humour and a scene of togetherness, which I feel that this form of characterisation, is an acquired speciality of Wes Anderson, Coincidently leading him into two nominations for best screenplay Oscars, for moonrise and the royal Tenenbaums.As much as I applaud Wes Anderson, beautiful story, I'm just not convinced by the performances of mister Die Hard, Bruce Willis and Ed Norton aka hulks smash, reason for this is that they are just too big and brash, for this sort of film, and can't quiet fit into this small and unique world that Wes crafts so well. It's like forcing a square peg into a round hole. Often being quiet difficult to endure both actors poor attempt to show true companion, leaving me so tempted as to fast forward any time they appear on screen, until I reach the runaway performance of both main characters, Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman. In a world full of big, over the top blockbusters, leave it to a small indie-esk, Wes Anderson picture to allow our imagination to fun free, and provide us with a story with true escapism to blow the rest away. Last year was a good year for films, but moonrise kingdom should be on top of everyone's 2012 list, a must see for all film lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

So Wes Anderson,"This one lacked the impact and momentum of Wes Anderson's previous films. But it's so Wes Anderson that the style of it really brings this film to fruition. And I really liked the style and the direction of this film, especially when it comes to the odd and yet quirky interactions and humor. Again the retro vibe is just splattered on screen from beginning to end. When it comes to the story it sort of reminded me of a Wes Anderson's version of Peter Pan. I like the emotional battles between ideals and realism with emotions mixed in. This is a simpler Wes Anderson film that is really worth the watch. Not his best work, but Stylistically it's superb.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wes Anderson better than his best,"I've been a fan of the young auteur Wes Anderson for quite a while now and it's been a lot of fun to watch his career change and mature as he makes more and more wonderful films. His latest flick, Moonrise Kingdom, might just be his most aesthetically brilliant directorial outing yet. In fact, it's safe to say it is one of his finest films out of the seven he has made. Moonrise Kingdom is an adventurous love story about a young boy and a girl who have been in touch ever since meeting at their summer camp's production of Noah's Ark. During the summer of 1967 the boy, Sam, runs away from his troop of Khaki scouts to meet up with Suzy, the girl. A quirky yet beautiful relationship sparks immediately, but meanwhile search parties are sent out all over the island on which the film takes place to find the two starry eyed children. It's a film full of the usual Wes Anderson quirkiness, but it also displays a new kind of mature filmmaking that solidifies Anderson's stake as a true auteur and a truly superb director.Moonrise Kingdom boasts a colorful cast of characters that is full of the Anderson regulars like Jason Schwartzman and Bill Murray, but also has some newcomers like Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, and even a hilarious cameo by Harvey Keitel. This multitude of characters come together to create an absolutely magnificent story. The characters are full of life and it's amazing to watch how this diverse cast can come together to carry this film with its very specific style full of matter-of-fact dialogue and very rigid movements. All of the cast does an excellent job at perfecting the style Anderson has created here. It's the kind of brilliance that can't be explained by words, but rather just by seeing the excellence of this film come together.But perhaps the most incredible thing about Moonrise Kingdom is what Anderson has achieved visually here. Anderson has always had a very specific style to the way he directs. His camera movements are always very straight and very flat. His pans are very specific and he works them in such a way that is under appreciated by the average movie goer. Anderson is an expert at framing a shot and he is in love with making perfect picture frame shots out of his settings. His camera work has always been something special, but in Moonrise Kingdom he utilizes his own style to a whole new exceptional level. I was blown away by the way he shot this film and the way he framed each and every shot so perfectly, without a single flaw in the setup of his scenes.Everything Anderson does with the camera here is flawless and it is the thing which characterizes the adventurous and free spirit of this film. There's a certain magical quality about this film that comes through its incredibly creative visual style. Moonrise Kingdom is delivered perfectly and I couldn't have asked for a more stylistic film from Anderson. It's the film which encompasses the style he has been developing ever since the release of his first film. Moonrise Kingdom is easily one of Anderson's best films to date.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
REALLY disappointing!,"I was so disappointed when we watched this movie. When I picked it out at the video store - I saw it had some good actors, the story sounded interesting.I kept waiting for the movie to have some substance and come together but it never happened. I don't mind quirky movies, I remember the TV series Twin Peaks - really liked it. I generally like underdog movies. However, none of the characters were developed enough for me to care about them. My friend, who is a parent, was really disturbed by a few scenes. He wondered what kind of parent would allow their little girl to do some of those scenes?I HIGHLY recommend you take a pass on this one!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Highly Underrated Wes Anderson Film,"Look, I haven't watched the Royal Tenenbaums. Hell, I haven't even watched The Grand Budapest Hotel. But I sure want to because according to most, there even better then this wonderful film. From what I've watched from Wes Anderson, I can confidently say that this is his most visually appealing film. The forests, the lakes, the trees, its great. The characters somehow all manage to have complete character arcs in one film and there is some truly great, nearly complex dialogue sprinkled in. It also hits you with some action every once in a while, something I wouldn't expect from a Wes Anderson film. There's some goofy stuff, let's just say lightning related. But overall, a great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wes Anderson takes us to our teenage times with fun and melancholy at the same time,"Wes Anderson is one of the directors that takes care of the visuals of his movies at the best. And he also is one of the directors that can make us laugh and cry in the same movie but in a very good way, not like those sappy comedy movies.In this movie he tells us the story of two young lovers who decided to escape, one from her house and the other from his scout camp, to start a journey through the island where they live so they can be together. The story is great in the sense that is very well told to us, with a narrator that introduces us to the place and time the story is set. And with that the story starts. It has the unique style of Wes Anderson and if you like that you will surely love this movie. It has subtle humour introduced through the whole movie, it has romantic moments, it has funny moments, and it has melancholic moments, but never feels dull or boring, at least for me.The cast is formed by some well-known actors like Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray or Tilda Swinton, and all of them in their small roles they do a great job, but the stars that really shine in this movie are the two unknown actors in the main roles of Suzy (Kara Hayward) and Sam (Jared Gilman). They have a great chemistry between them and they carry the movie on their own with no problem, making you connect with them very easy.As usual in Anderson movies, the visuals are stunning and beautiful, with every shot full of little details and calculated at the minimum part. So you could watch this movie twice, one for discovering the story and so, and the other to discover all the small details hidden in every shot of the movie. And if to those visuals you add the soundtrack, that mixes classical Wes Anderson songs with the score of Alexandre Desplat, who always manages to capture the essence of Anderson's films, you have a truly great film about a summer romance that will take you to younger times.I highly recommend this movie to every Wes Anderson fan, but also to everyone who wants to go back to his childhood and his teenage times with nothing to worry about. Highly enjoyable movie full of great stories, great actors, great visuals, great music and full of emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's great, but Melody is better","To my mind this is childhood romance through the eye of an adult whereas Melody (1971) seems entirely much more from the perspective of someone around 12.

A Bit Strange.....But Then Again it's Wes Anderson!,"If you are a fan of Wes Anderson or a lover of excellent cinema, then this film, Moonrise Kingdom is for you. It's nothing short of strange, but I loved this vivid tale of storytelling. The way this film was set up is nearly exquisite. The visuals are striking and colorful especially for an indie film. The characters are an odd bunch, but you can feel that each character has goodness in them, no matter their weirdness or flaws.Wes Anderson's film is about a blossoming romance between two 12-year-olds and they run away from their town and that riles up the townspeople and tension amounts as they began to search for the kids.This film is well-acted. Newcomers Jared Gilman and Sara Heyward were impressive and they really had perfect though a purposefully awkward chemistry between them. Since this is a Wes Anderson film, Bill Murray is here. He does a very good job. Same can be said for Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, and Edward Norton. These people may be a little on the dumb side, but you can't help liking them or at least sympathizing with them.Overall, this is yet another great film on Anderson's filmography. It tells a tale about romance and how people will go far as they can to keep their relationship intact. One amusing thing I noticed here is how it seems like their town is only made up of ten people. I found that pretty amusing. I found this film to be funny and beautifully written as well. The addition of the narrator adds some more quirkiness to the story. This is one of the best films of 2012 no doubt. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen,"I got stuck watching this on a flight from Denver to NYC. I am terrified of flying and was looking forward to a movie that would make the long flight a bit more bearable. This movie was not it. No one else on the plane seemed to even be paying attention to it. There was a whole bunch of scenes with this idiot kids running about hiding in the woods with a silly sheriff and scout master running about looking for him. There were no really sympathetic characters. The girl was way out of the boy's league. Why she would have anything at all to do with this guy is beyond me. Lots of outdoor shots. There was bullying. Eventually I just stopped watching, hard to do when all the screens in the plane are focused on the this idiotic movie. I started reading and my book was much better than the movie. I noticed when I went to the restroom that almost no one had earphones on-required to listen. And those that did were not looking up so they were more likely listing to music.

A Stylish and Refreshing Movie-Making Experience,"22 June 2012. Taking its thematic and overall tone from the classic Stand By Me (1986) this not even quite a coming of age movie, involves the story of two runaways on a close-knit island community full of wilderness. Unlike Stand By Me, there some additional characters that add to the charm and excitement, and drama to the movie. Also this movie appears to have obtained some of its inspiration from Juno (2007) and A Christmas Story (1983) in this depiction of its characters and presentation. There is a lot of humor, some drama, and even some action to be found in this movie, along with a rather fascinating use of camera work and set designs that almost for a contemporary fairy tale-like movie. The entire cast of character bring an entertaining and compelling presentation to the screen that deals with young romantic love, betrayal, honor, redemption, and a way of life beyond one's age.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not a don't-miss-it, yet nevertheless a do-see-it","Moonrise Kingdom combines elements of Ballad of Jack and Rose (set on an isolated island off New England; coming-of-age / loss-of-innocence), Mermaids (set in the early 1960s; coming-of-age / loss-of-innocence -- in turn reminding me of Hideous Kinky, wherein hipster mom has older daughter who longs to be ""straight""), yet manages to be completely original. In addition, it's completely engaging, i.e., not once did I ask myself, ""Where the hell is this going?"" as I do while viewing many recent films, even ones I end up liking. Along with Moonrise Kingdom being a delightful period piece (saddle shoes, rotary-dial phones and a switchboard operator, the all-important close 'n' play record player) the acting, the dialog, the plot, and the setting combine to produce a totally entertaining product. Not a don't-miss-it, yet nevertheless a do-see-it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A big little movie,"Not that we need another review - just go see it. This is one of the few movies that I could watch again.First, the trivia: This is Kara Hayward's first movie. She was 12 when cast. So was Natalie Portman, in ""Léon: The Professional"". Hayward could well have a great career in film.Next up: ""PG-13, for smoking"". Sheesh.Everybody knows the basic story - but what about the film? The camera work is amazing. It opens up with a tour through Suzy's parents' home, going from room to room, floor to floor. We first see Suzy, looking straight out at the camera (us?) through her ever-present binoculars. Later, we're in the ""Kakhi Scouts"" camp, where we meet Scout Master Ward. As he walks to the breakfast table, the camera follows him from the side, not from ahead. There's an empty chair at the table, then we're off and running.I thought Sam's character looked a lot younger than Suzy's. Could that be on purpose? Suzy's makeup, blue eyeliner, gives her an older look. Behind those glasses, Sam looks younger.There's a Narrator (Bob Balaban), a bit like a Greek Chorus, who opens the story, and fills us in on some of the details, and finally interacts with the searchers to tell them where they might look for the fugitives.Some of the scenes are marvelous (maybe a Wes Anderson trademark?). In ""St Jack's Church"", just before a major hurricane, they're performing Britten's ""Noye's Fludde"". The set inside the church is brilliant.(The classical music selections (Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, Simple Symphony - both by Britten) - are the Leonard Bernstein recordings.)Harvey Keitel (who's doing a lot of work these years) plays ""Commander Pierce"", the commander-in-chief of the Kakhi Scouts, a grizzled old veteran who takes his job seriously.Tilda Swinton (reprising her character as the White Witch in the Narnia movies) plays the character known only as ""the social worker"". Her job in to find Sam and put him in a juvenile facility, something everybody else doesn't really think is a good idea.One example of the way Anderson unfolds the story: we find out that Sam's an orphan, and he's run away (again) from foster parents. The scene with Capt. Sharp talking to them (split-screen), shows them in a kitchen - leading you to think they're just plain old folks who've taken in a foster child. Later on, we see that it's really a pretty large facility, with at least a half-dozen other boys (looking mostly like James Dean in a 50s movie).One thing to think about: The cast includes Bruce Willis, Bill Murray (of course), Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton .... and two complete unknowns, the real stars and central focus of the movie. First off, all that talent never overshadows the two stars - it's their movie, their story. Second, would it have been any better - or worse - if another group of unknowns had been cast in all those supporting roles? Did the producers figure nobody would see it if the A-list wasn't in it?Two other groups in the cast stand out: the three other Bishop kids, and the scout troop - all first-rate actors.Unfortunately, there's no screen credit for the dog.

Highly recommended for viewing!,"""Moorise kingdom"" - the very title already gave the impression that the story would be like a fairy tale, that was the first thing that attracted me to this film. It's an innocent and touching story able to resonate in the heart of both young and adult viewers.The only thing I knew before watching the film was that it has good visuals, which is important for me, otherwise I didn't have any expectations. It is also my first experience with Wes Anderson's work.The film explores various themes, such as first love, friendship and loyalty, and the importance of sharing your feelings and experiences with others. The problem of family relationships is touched upon in passing. However, the film remains light, funny and thought-provoking. It shows that children sometimes face difficulties which cannot be solved by some adults.I think this film is perfect for family viewing and will brighten up your evening.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wasted my time,"The acting in this movie is non-existent. Except for Edward Norton and Bruce Willis' performances who actually have some inflections in their voice and an array of facial expressions the other protagonists have an a constant look of -_- .

First 10 minutes of the film aggravated me to the point of actually voicing my frustration out loud in my room.I don't usually write reviews for movies, but this one is just retarded.

A Brilliantly Witty Film,"This movie has an excellent quirky style , which is one of Wes Anderson's signatures. Moonrise Kingdom has a familiar base story but is done in such a great way. It shows love between two characters who couldn't fit in with their groups but feel good with each other. The story may take some time to pick up but when it does it becomes what I expected and even better. The story is set in the 60's and they use certain things to create certain moods to scenes. Each scene is also very detailed and I could tell this is probably exactly what Wes envisioned when this was just only an idea. The actors who play the main characters seem like they don't have professional training but their acting is perfect for this film. They just fit well with who the characters are and basically become them. The other cast members also do an excellent job and some of the most memorable were Ed Norton and Bruce Willis and many others. I personally enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would and I really loved the dialog between characters and also the images he created with the great camera work the most from this film.I personally would recommend Moonrise Kingdom to anyone and I will make sure to recommend Wes Anderson's other film also.Verdict: 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The other two movies were much hyped about (unnecessarily so, if I may add). Moonrise Kingdom, on the other hand, has to be one of the most under-rated movies ever. With a very interesting cast, a unique soundtrack and a story line that epitomizes simplicity, Moonrise Kingdom presents ""young romance"" like never presented before. What stood out for me the most, was the dialogue of the movie. One would expect normal lovers to converse in flowery confessions. Haunting, uncomfortable and dark: these are the words I would use to describe the conversations between the two leads of the movie. Despite the darkness of the movie, it was not short on humor. All in all, this movie has everything that a good movie should! Highly recommended to any movie fanatic. You're sure to enjoy it :)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonstruck with Moonrise Kingdom! But I do not think it belongs in the kingdom as one of the best films of 2012!,"The Wes Anderson quirky flick ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is not for everyone; but when we are talking about Wes-stern films, you must know that they are for an acquired taste. His movies are infamous for being unorthodox and strange, which is very similar to my movie reviews minus the wisdom. I personally like many of his films, even though I found a couple of them disappointing; ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is not one of them. It is very good, even though I do not like it as much as many critics and pseudo-critics do; I belong in the latter category by the way. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is set in an island village near the coast of (oops, I forgot!). I should have listened more to the film's Narrator who was marvelously played by Bob Balaban. The movie really stars two unknown child actors, Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward as Sam and Suzy. They meet and young love commences. Sam belongs to a Scout Troop group, but runs that coup to meet with young Suzy for a childhood romantic adventure. Sam is an orphan, who is a misfit with the rest of his scout peers. Suzy comes from an upper-middle class family that has its share of dysfunction. Suzy rebels against her parents, who are both lawyers. She also has an anger management problem, but takes a sweet liking to Sam. So therefore they plan the ""Summer of Sam and Suzy"". Edward Norton co-stars as Scout Master Ward who is distraught that one of his scouts has runaway, of course I am referring to Sam. Bill Murray and Frances McDormand portray Suzy's parents, Walt and Laura Bishop. They are also in disarray when Suzy goes missing. Bruce Willis has been a die-hard fan of Anderson movies, so he rolls into this one as the Island Police Captain Sharp. Willis' sharp performance as the Captain was king. The rest of the cast was also quite sharp, I must say. Besides the aforementioned actors, we also had some good thespian work from Tilda Swinton as a Social Service Agent who went by the name ""Social Services""; (you gotta love it), and also from Jason Schwartzman as Uncle Ben, I mean Cousin Ben (sorry I had too much rice). Anderson's direction and writing was worthy, even though he did not bring anything new to the cinematic table which he has not done before. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" contains the same Anderson ingredients as his past films: family dysfunction, emotionless expressions, and tactile objects as narrative centerpieces, etc. etc. etc. My favorite ""Moonrise Kingdom"" feature was its spectacular cinematography. Many are predicting that ""Moonrise Kingdom"" will thy kingdom come to the Academy Award spotlight with several nominations. I would not put it in that pedestal, but I have no reservations why you should not scout out ""Moonrise Kingdom"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charm Incarnate,"I've never appreciated Wes Anderson. I've never gone out of my way to see his little corduroy clad hipster films. That's probably because my first exposure to his work came 10 years ago when I rented The Royal Tenenbaums, a movie about nothing more than the posturing of unrealistic traits and staring at the camera head on. His latest effort, Moonrise Kingdom, is my effort to give him a second chance.It's mid-1960s New England and Khaki Scout Sam (Jared Gilman) is missing. He flew the coupe and Scout Master Ward is tasked with finding him, which fits nicely with the mythos of summer camping. Police Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) is mounts his own search, only to find that local girl Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) has joined Sam. The two plot to get away from the conflicts in their lives, but have to meet with a dose of reality.The odd style director Wes Anderson has developed over the years goes into full effect. It doesn't matter if it's a stop motion animated map sequence or Edward Norton's childish way of receiving a thrown shoe, there isn't a shot in Moonrise Kingdom lacking in auteur theory stylization. The actors are almost always framed with stage production awareness.The robotic charm put on by the cast is a perfect fit for the presentation. It's actually quire endearing. That's not to say anyone is particularly believable, but there is an effort to strike against that notion. A strong performance is believable within the context of a film's reality, which isn't always our own. That's what gives this comedy-drama some charm. It's funny that a 12-year old boy paints landscapes and nudes. It's funny that getting hit by lightning goes all but forgotten. For you and I the lingering effects would encompass our entire day, but for Sam it's no biggie.Another dose of charm comes in the juxtaposition of the harmony created by the kids and the convoluted and bureaucratic world the adults preside over. I could go as far as to say the conclusion is storybook predictable, or the overt bluntness of the narrative cheapens any sense of crafty subtleness. Moonrise Kingdom may be about kids, but the themes and some suggestive material make it more for the adult who recalls The Goonies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
We were not amused,"This is a story, in 1965, about 2-teenagers (Sam and Suzy) who run away from their homes, and discover true friendship, love and some sex. The parents of Suzy (Kara Hayward) label her as ""troubled.' The parents of Sam (Jared Gilman) say they cannot cope with him anymore and write him a note not to come back when he runs away. The whole island gears up to find the runaways.The best thing about this movie is the music. Everything else is done in an extremely dead-pan way. You will, however, enjoy this movie if you are friends with Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel. They pull off the most dead-pan performances you will ever see, although you will see some animation with Keitel and Swinton. Maybe it was supposed to be that way, but hey, there is an audience out here and we were not amused. If the powers that be didn't want to involve the audience, they should have left it as a book, which was probably more exciting than this. Yes, some will say I didn't understand this at all. They could be right, but this was not entertaining and I was not amused. I kept checking the DVR to see how much was left.Did we care about anything? Well we enjoyed the interplay between Sam and Suzy, but even that was held at a distance from the audience (that would be us) and from themselves too. Their dialogues were on the dead-pan order too and came across as ""matter of fact."" In other words no real emotion and not ""dead-pan"" funny. The sex was non-existent as it should have been considering the ages of the runaways. There was a copping a feel and attempts at French kissing at one point. Innocent enough and didn't last long. Again, did we care about anything? Yes, when would this be over.There was supposed to be a very big storm to come in and wreck everything. Give me a break. A little rain, wind, and sounds of thunder do not a storm make. So the storm didn't work.There is narration almost throughout, but it fell flat and why did they bother? That was an excellent chance to do inject some humor if humor wasn't going to show up in characters' dialogues. And, of course, it didn't. That is, unless you are friends with the stars mentioned above. I can hear them howling with laughter now.What do I really think? This deserves a Do-Over with a better script to include humor. Dead-pan humor is good when it is funny. This was not. (3/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Copping a feel: Yes, briefly. French kissing: Yes, briefly. Language: Some soft stuff only and not much of it.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonrise Kingdom is a whimsical piece of work. Worth the watch!!,"Moonrise Kingdom is a whimsical piece of work. With its deadpan humour, caricature-like characters and storybook imagery, it's a lovely film about young love.Directed by Wes Anderson, the film stars Sam and Suzy (played charmingly by newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward) as a pair 12- year-old lovers.Sam is an orphan Khaki Scout who escapes from his camp thinking that no one will miss his absence. Suzy on the other hand, is left depressed because of her disjointed family. While she catches her mother Laura (Frances McDormand) having an affair with the town policeman Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), her father Walt (Bill Murray), doesn't even seem to care.So acting like typical 12-year-olds, the only logical reason would be to run away.Having spent a year being secret pen pals, the youngsters plot an escape and flee their unhappy lives to be together. However, the two can't escape everything. There's a hurricane quickly approaching, as narrator Bob Balaban tells us as he randomly appears throughout the film to provide updates and anecdotes.Perfectly paced, the film jumps back and forth between Sam and Suzy's campout in the woods and the frenzy they cause back home with Sam's fellow scouts and a bunch of adults including Suzy's parents, Captain Sharp, Sam's scoutmaster (played by a very chipper Edward Norton) and a woman only known as Social Services (Tilda Swinton).With the film playing out like a storybook adventure, Sam and Suzy are a very fitting match. As they awkwardly and endearingly develop their romantic relationship, their chemistry appears to be very natural.But that's not to say the other characters aren't brilliantly crafted. With the script's witty dialogue and the characters' deadpan sense of humours, what's really fantastic about this film is the eccentric personalities presented.And by adding in nice touches through its soundtrack, costumes and props (can I say how awesome Suzy's portable record player was?!), the film certainly adds a feeling of nostalgia as it gives an impression of a simpler way of life in the 60s.Positively received at the recent Cannes Film Festival, Moonrise Kingdom definitely shines. From its quirky and hilarious characters to Anderson's idyllic cinematography, this is a charming film about pre- pubescent love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Extraordinarily touching - see it while you can,"While I cannot speak for those who aren't comfortable with the style of director Wes Anderson, I hope that they will give this film a chance.This is a film for adults about kids. Wes Anderson has carefully dreamed up a ripe setting for his story, with characters that feel remarkably real, yet have a cartoon charm.The sets and costuming are very well thought-out, with each character being instantly recognizable, whether it be the iconic uniformed boy and pink-dressed girl of the film, the sloppy getup of her father (played by the perfectly unenthusiastic Bill Murray), or the blue gown of Social Services.The acting of this film is not glamorous, but impeccably honest. Half of the actors are children, the other half adults. The adult actors, consisting of several huge names, capture a parental lethargy that adult watchers should recognize. The child roles, on the other hand, are where the real action is, as the kids pursue the events of the story in the style of a romantic action film. Wes Anderson captures these dual tones very well.While the playful attitude of the film is amusing and will leave you laughing many times, I would not label Moonrise Kingdom as a comedy. The story resonates with darker themes that left me sympathizing with each character on a deeper level than I had expected.There are melancholic undertones throughout Moonrise Kingdom, but the resolution of this story will leave you happy and satisfied. Please treat yourself to it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another wonderful indie,"I wish that Hollywood made entertaining films and I always look forward to films Like Marigold Hotel, safety not guaranteed and this quirky classic. I've admired Wes since Bottle Rocket and I really think this is his best. From start to finish, not a single false note was present, and like the other 2 films satisfying with a capitol S.. The cast is superb. The thing that sustains me is there are film makers who tell stories which relate to us as people. This film is a fairy story, but the 2 kids are so wonderful its easy to think it is real. To have stars like Bruce Willis and others lend their talent to a film like is simply wonderful. None of these 3 films are copycats unlike the endless crap like John Carter, a film that cost 250 million, and yet the imbeciles who made it didn't have enough brains to make a title. John who cares. The mind numbing garbage 3D films that have horrible scripts and do 11 sequels. Guys like Anderson and many others can write like their old film counterparts. Now it is techs who use phony cgi as the backbone of their bottom feeding garbage My wife says thank heavens there are men and women who can write and who care about film as art!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Everything a movie should be,"Perfect cast, well written, solid acting, beautiful scenery and colors, as well as a sweeping sometimes oddball soundtrack make this a great film. As the title says, Moonrise kingdom is everything a movie should be and it will leave you wanting more from every character. None of it feels choppy or ""tacked on"" mainly because Anderson manages to immerse the viewer in his world, a whimsical and vivid place where we believe anything can happen. The movie centers around two strange kids who discover they love each other and decide to run away from their strange lives. The ensuing ""rescue attempt"" by basically the whole community manages to be quirky, hilarious, and compelling at all times, and also gives us insight and backstory on the fabulous supporting cast. I don't want to spoil the movie for you so.... if you're reading this because you're unsure, I'd recommend either read a few more reviews or just go see it. It's honestly a gem of a movie and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Campy adventure,"Although this movie features a scout troop as a central theme, this is not a scouting movie. It's the story of a scout who leaves his troop during camp to join his pen pal girlfriend and run away. The style of the movie is campy (sorry for the pun), with interesting camera perspectives, warm coloring, and authentic reproduction of 1960's themes. Those of you in your forties will recognize toys and styles from your youth. Throughout the movie you will be kept engaged as the story unfolds, and plays out between the small town and the runaways. Something to note is the non-negative portrayal of scouting, that is occasionally tongue in cheek, but plays into expected conflict between the scouting youth, the runaway lovers, and the odd characters of the town. Bill Murray and Bruce Willis are welcome characters, and the young actors are very authentic. Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
aaarggghhh; another terrible self congratulatory tripe production,"And the Emmy goes to ..... nobody in this total piece of garbage. This is like 10 different actors trying to steal the scene running in different directions; throw in a editor that is only concerned in getting the properly framed picture and a director that will take the movie miles in a random direction to get to one line he thinks is cool. Net effect is white noise of very good acting and cinematography but each item reading from a different script. The movie tries DESPERATELY to come across shy, sweet, lovable, childhood innocence but fails due to over direction and complete lack of story. The actors are each in their on rite extremely strong and well developed characters. Especially the children actors come across as extremely strong characters but since there is literally NO STORY LINE the actors are forced to try to improv a story. This movie would be unaffected if instead it was each actor standing on a stage for a 15 minute soliloquy.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wes Anderson makes a Inspiring Director jealous.,"This film for me can not be summed up. It is pure excellence. I am a HUGE Wes Anderson fan so this movie had all of his very noticeable trade marks throughout the film. The movie besides its great director is just one one those movies that once its over you are just sitting there staring at the screen with that feeling of ""Aw its over"" and man did i just see something great. Seeing this movie along with any other Wes Anderson films leaves you with a presence as if you learned something from the movie and also leaves you still stuck in the world that Wes has just put you in. The film is great i recommend it to any movie lover or anyone who wants to start to become one because this movie will truly make you appreciate movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Is this man a genius?,"You don't so much enter this charming film, as hover endlessly in front of it. Like so many of his painstakingly planned tracking shots, I felt that I had drifted across the face of something amazing, though never quite touched down, except perhaps in those so-deliberate punchline moments that Anderson punctuates his scripts with, like clock chimes, ringing out the awkward progress of his films.This, however, felt like the point. Anderson was deliberately straddling some essential cinematic paradox. His exquisite, tyrannic control of the scenery, the clothing, the actors and the script - which thrusts Moonrise Kingdom into an almost panel comic world - can never fully distract attention from the fact of itself, from its nature as utterly, consciously, unapologetically staged. Yet, I ended up feeling that, despite itself, it was an incredible film. Even more amazing, it managed to convey a love story between two prepubescent teenagers with little or no sentimentality, and zero prurience.At moments it felt as though we have inherited a comic Fellini, as happy to pepper his own work with references to Sin City as The Satyricon. Anderson himself must have dealt with the compromises such a style forces on the director - that to serve up this brand of farce largely excludes any serious connection with the characters themselves. Yet you DO feel something for his characters, even though you suspect, perhaps, Anderson doesn't want you to. It's not a conventional sympathy, more a faint sense of superiority, for being in on the joke that they themselves can never get.I ended up wondering exactly what it IS Anderson wants me to feel about these two children, their escape from one non-threatening situation into another. When the red-jacketed narrator appears, and the cross cuts that see him switch location after location while never breaking his stream of explanation, why does he offset each cut, rather than matching them up seamlessly, as he so easily could have? Why does Wes Anderson never let me forget that I'm watching a movie?In the end, I found myself suspecting that this man, who is unquestionably a visionary maker of some fantastic - if divisive - films, is compensating for something. I began to wonder if, maybe, his devotion to set-piece cinema was the act of someone making films the only way he possibly could - with a fanatic, nearly autistic attention to every conceivable detail. At moments, the results skirt the sublime. They honestly do. And it is no disrespect to say that he is not a natural, not that sort of director who can point a camera at anything and make it beautiful, or fascinating. Moonrise Kingdom is a masterpiece, but ultimately, the camera is almost an afterthought, bought in after everything else has been done. But who else is going to have a 3-minute track through an active 1963 Scout Camp? or watch, from a distance, as those dozens of scouts chase one of their own in a giant yellow corkscrew across a wet park at night?When it looks so beautiful, feels so very nearly poetic, and is - in fact - this funny, does it matter why?",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Touching, Funny Film That Is A Sheer Delight","This well plotted picture, filmed in the subdued, slightly softened film effect of the 1960s, was a joy. I can hardly say enough good about this movie. Excellent casting – the mix of seasoned performers who in no way steal the film but rather enhance it to perfection – the young unknown leads, precocious youngsters attempting to live a life of freedom, could not have been played better by Kara Hayward as Suzy and Jared Gilman as Sam. Edward Norton as the Scout Master was yet another example of brilliant casting. Melancholy, hilarious, poignant, upliftingthere were not many emotions untouched, and marvelously, in this production. Bruce Willis is a dear and I've got to say that Bill Murray is getting better and better at the craft of acting as he gets older. Never a big fan (although how could you not have enjoyed Meatballs) I am becoming one with each recent movie of his that I've seen. Don't miss this one. I can guarantee you will love this movie and probably, like me, want to see it again. Well done on every single level!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved this film,"Wes creates a childhood-romance fantasy. If you can remember how it was to be young and in love, this is it. You're involved in Sam and Suzy's misadventures and struggle to simply be with each other. In his own style of direction, he makes you feel as though you are apart of their involved in a secret romance.Portraying a seemingly-naive couple of kids, they take part in completely outrageous adventures. I felt as though the movie was perfect itself. Funny, without trying too hard. He managed to tell an epic love story in his way. The script was brilliant and witty.I highly recommend this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
How to ruin a film,"This movie is a classic example of how a film which should have been successful was turned into an abject failure. This can all be blamed on Wes Anderson, the director and co-writer. The film has magnificent art direction and production design, and many excellent actors. But the approach is entirely wrong. I have given considerable thought to what exactly must have gone wrong in the execution of this interesting project. The feel I get is that when most of the scenes were shot, the director, and doubtless the crew as well, must have been so convinced that everything was hysterically funny that all they had to do was turn the camera on and the audience would realize that too. But it doesn't happen. The set-ups are too artificial and contrived, the 'hysterically funny material' is taken for granted, and little is done to convince the viewer that he should agree with the director and join in his cosy coterie of admirers and all chuckle and laugh on cue like a group of trained seals. Viewers are not seals, they are people, and they require convincing. Anderson appears to have forgotten that what to him is hysterically funny can be to 'someone out there' merely stilted, contrived, and unfunny, especially when he adopts cutsey mannerisms and coy approaches which only serve to alienate the material even further from even the slightest semblance of reality, making it laughable for all the wrong reasons, by which I mean that the film itself becomes a joke, not that there are jokes in the film. One cannot make a film simply based upon the premise that it is funny, one has to work hard to make it funny by achieving spontaneity, which is the secret of all comedy. Artificiality such as we see in this film is the death, not the birth, of comedy. Comedy is more difficult than tragedy. If nobody cries at a tragedy, that is not the end of the world, but it is fatal if no one laughs at a comedy. Even though the two oddball kids who star in this film were very amusing, and the idea was also amusing, the end result was not. With a decent director, this film might have worked. There are directors around who could have turned it into something magical and delightful. But instead, it is a 'lead balloon' and an ignominious directorial catastrophe. And I really had to force myself to sit through it, which was a terrible ordeal. I felt sorry for the kids, whose efforts were wasted. They obeyed all those instructions to keep poker faces, to stand in unconvincing postures, to look at one another and at others in unnatural and contrived ways and to behave in an overly ridiculous fashion in the pursuit of laughs which are never achieved because they are too false. All this artificiality was to no avail. If even one scene had been allowed to be natural, rather than contrived, there would at least have been a few moments of this film which were enjoyable. If only Woody Allen had been given that budget and that material, it would have worked. But no one has ever given Woody Allen that much money to make a film, and they never will, because he is a genuine artist, and people like Wes Anderson are just empty paper bags full of stale air. That is why Woody Allen never works in Hollywood, in case no one ever noticed.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Typically magnificent Anderson style and humour,"One thing that is clear about 60 seconds in - this is definitely a Wes Anderson film. Rarely can you see the stylistic stamp of a director so clearly and so quickly. Generally I would consider this a big plus - it's a great story with good performances throughout.As with other Anderson films, it is all about the distinctive style and his offbeat timing. There is barely a shot in the whole film that is not an intriguing mix of colour and symmetry, indeed you could probably watch this without the sound and enjoy it. A series of A-list actors line up to be included, though the nature of the film doesn't give them much room to move.The drawback of the heightened style is that, for a story of young love, the film has no emotional core at all. Nothing is heartfelt, or real. This is consistent with Anderson's other films and doesn't detract, however with this subject matter it leaves a slight sense of shallowness that there are no 'real' characters or emotions within the film. Overall an impressive, if not quite perfect, piece of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Surprisingly great!,"I'm not a big fan of Wes Anderson films at all. I find all of them Rushmore, Royal Tenenbaums, Life Aquatic etc. to be odd for odds sake. I also find them kinda dragged out and ridiculous. That being said I have to say I kinda loved Moonrise Kingdom. This tale of two pre teens in love and running away together has such an undeniable charm. Sure it's odd but maybe because it's focused on the kids is the reason it works so well. Yes it's still odd but it's without a doubt the most imaginative of his films and one of the best and most creative films this year. With an all star cast that really shines Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Francis McDormand and led by two addictively raw and lovingly awkward performances from Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward. Filled with some beautifully endearing moments of genuine connection it still gets a little too silly in spots but it's really quite a fantastical cinematic experience. 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
I cannot fault this quirky masterpiece,"Moonrise Kingdom is directed by Wes Anderson and follows the journey of two children in 1965 on an island off the coast of New England. Anderson's unique style works incredibly well in this film, and that's thanks to perfect casting. The two leads being Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward give such captivating performances through their impressive line delivery. It would be very easy for this story to feel slow and disinteresting, but each cast member truly brings the script to life in the most entertaining way. As usual, this Wes Anderson film contains stunning cinematography and striking visuals through his use of pastel colours and artistic sets. The film also utilises music in such a great way, specifically in one iconic scene which contains a fantastic French song. For a risky style which is very prone to the notion of hit or miss, I truly believe Moonrise Kingdom hits the mark in every area. From plot to film making I cannot fault this quirky masterpiece. Moonrise Kingdom ticks every box for me so therefore I give it a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Instant Favorite,"I may be a HUGE Wes Anderson fan, but even if I wasn't, I'd still love this film. It's simply incredible. It's one of my favorite love stories of all time (right next to ""Harold & Maude"", & ""But I'm A Cheerleader"" to name a few). It's definitely made it into my top favorites in general of all time for sure, too.I went into this without any preconceptions or any idea what it was about, as I feel it's the best way to see a film & also to look at it subjectively, I'm able to enjoy films WAY more & get pleasantly surprised by them, & I'm hardly ever let down, especially due to things like trailers or hype by others. I can sincerely say I was absolutely pleasantly surprised, entertained, emotionally involved & just all around in love with it. I was severely disappointed with Darjeeling Limited, as it went absolutely nowhere & even though there were a few minor semi-funny parts, it was mostly just boring. That's not because I didn't get it though, it just wasn't interesting. This was a very redeeming film for me in every way & I think using a very different cast this time proved interesting & fun as well.The cast is phenomenal, especially the two main stars, who I'd say are some of the best child actors I've seen since maybe the little girl in ""The Fall"" or Natalie Portman in ""The Professional"". It was nice to see him use different actors than his normal bunch, though of course (not surprisingly) Bill Murray & (thankfully) Jason Shwartzman had small parts. Edward Norton & Bruce Willis did an absolutely fantastic job & I highly enjoyed seeing them in this. They were also very different roles for them to play, it seems, especially Bruce Willis. Was happily surprised at the star playing a troop leader near the end (don't want to ruin it for you).This movie has everything good in it, from the awesome music, to the fun, dramatic, interesting story, to the romance, to the fantasy, to the acting & cinematography, to the colors & all around style, the humor, wit & intelligence...and so on. I'd recommend this to anyone. It shouldn't fail to keep one entertained (unless they're an emotionless idiot maybe, then they should stick to their boring, talentless, big budget action flicks with ""pretty"" faces etc) & the whimsy of it all is worth every moment. You won't be able to predict what's going to happen most of the time, which makes every moment a fun & surprising one. Why this doesn't have at least 9 stars here is beyond me, except it's probably due to the lack of interest people have these days for anything witty, intelligent or actually interesting & full of talent & hard work. I give it a 10, I really do. The only thing that sucked or disappointed me was that it had to end. :(Watch it, especially if you're in the mood for an original, sweet, fun love story full of awesomeness & adventure!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A heart with no name,"In true Wes Anderson fashion, Moonrise Kingdom presents us with a style and genre that does not fall neatly in line with most other films. This can be divisive among moviegoers, especially those seeking a comedy (for example) or a heartfelt romp. So perhaps it would be most appropriate to begin by clarifying what this movie is not: This movie is not a romance. A romance story (or at least a good one) fleshes out the twists and turns of a relationship. It explores the depths of intimacy and presents a conflict to lasting love. But Moonrise Kingdom is, ultimately, not about relationships or love. It's about companionship. In the protagonists' struggle against their own identities in a rigid society, they are able to find solace and comfort in one another. We can call it love--a precocious sort of puppy love--but that is not the point. The focus is not on their affection, but on their determination to simply be happy and accepted.This movie is not a comedy. It is funny, at parts, but there are no jokes. Most of the humor (which warrants smiles, inward chuckles, and looks of incredulity) are due to the almost cartoonish nature of the characters. There are pointedly absurd moments, but nothing that forces us to doubt the reality of it all. Whereas a comedy requires someone to be the butt of a joke, there are no characters who take the blunt force of our laughs. We chuckle not at the characters, but with them in the colorfully ridiculous lengths to which they go for their own goals. I speak not of the protagonists, by the way, but of their family, friends, and pursuers -- all of whom are trying to find their own place in an absurd world.If anything, this movie is about heart. It's about taking the time to understand those who may deviate from our expectations or own values, and learning to care about them regardless. It's about appreciating that which life presents us and finding opportunity at each turn. It's no coincidence that one of the film's themes is fairy-tales: the movie itself is an odd, but charming, fairy-tale that is romantic (though not a romance), comedic (though not a comedy), and heartfelt (though not sappy).Moonrise Kingdom will satisfy your hunger for a good story, as long as you don't mind deviating a bit from the expectations of... well, anything.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Very Good,"I saw ""Moonrise Kingdom."" for the second time yesterday and I liked this film because it is a simple story about people albeit very young who meet and for no apparent reason love each other. The premise here being how much reason should you have or need.When I see a movie based on a children's book (This might as well be) I imagine that I am seeing what people of that age are seeing or understanding. Understanding being the better word here in used.This however is probably not the case as perspective changes with time. Time only? I cannot tell if this movie is for adults or not because I do not think it mattered to Mr. Anderson who directed.It somehow resonates because when people are younger there is less of a reason for things to be the way they are or the way they turn out so life seems simpler.I like the character's in the film was 12 (-30) in 1965 the year in which it is set.So what!This is a fanciful treatment of a fanciful story no doubt.This movie is agreeably entertaining and well made and amusing so much so as to hold ones attention throughout.I couldn't help but think children's book through the whole movie and was surprised to find out otherwise.I thought this movie witty and insightful and entertaining and worthy of two tickets as stated above I have seen it twice.

Wes Anderson... what can I say?,"Just like every other Wes Anderson film, I loved Moonrise Kingdom. I fall in love with each of the characters and I wish that there was a way that I could live in one of his stories. This latest film is no exception. Rather than living on Ping island, I now want to move to the island off the New England coast in the summer of 1965. And I want that vintage look. In his previous films, such as The Royal Tenenbaums, Fantastic Mr. Fox or The Life Aquatic, Anderson created enigmatic miniature worlds, from treehouses, to boats, to tents. In Moonrise Kingdom, he does the same with an entire island. The film has every hallmark of a Wes Anderson movie, but it's his characters and extreme attention to set design that win me over, every time, within the first 8 minutes. After that, I melt in my seat and let myself be entertained by the wit that comes from the repressed angst of the characters, their old-fashioned values , their indispensable kind nature. Aside from being visually gorgeous, Anderson's familiar compositions and hilariously funny scripts are all I need from a cinematic experience. Still, every film can be watched over and over again, and you would find that you have missed some symbolism or stunning visual, hidden in one of the beautiful corners of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonrise Kingdom is bold and whimsical greatness,"Wes Anderson's latest cinematic treat is about two misfit kids who decide to run away together. They're 12, after all, and they know what's best and besides the boy is the knock-off version of an Eagle Scout and the girl has her magical binoculars. They're in love and nothing else matters. With the whole town searching for them in the New England wilderness and a record-breaking storm approaching, the two young lovebirds cover some pretty mature and touchy ground for their age, and a scene on the beach between the two is a sure mark of the actors' maturity, for it will make most people think twice about what they're watching. But director Anderson doesn't flinch in this scene, just as he doesn't through the whole film. He boldly paints a beautifully constructed (his cinematic framing is unparalleled) portrait of life as a youngster, and all of the awkward moments and feelings that entails. It's a quirky, heart-felt, emotional stroll through our memories, with rich, lively characters that only Wes Anderson could bring to the screen.-Thomas Bond, TheFilmDiscussion.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dull dull dull,"My friends recommended a couple of movies while I'm at home recuperating, among them being Moonrise Kingdom. Alas, not a good choice. I kept hoping the movie would improve, but it just kept going at the same bland, boring pace.It might have been better had the main characters be in any way sympathetic. At the end, I had a modicum of feeling about what would happen to them, but just about.

"Beautiful, heartfelt, innocent, and unmistakably Wes Anderson.","I watched Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel, which I greatly enjoyed, so I decided to give Moonrise Kingdom a try too. I was not disappointed.If GBH was a shade of candy-coloured pink, this is a warm golden yellow. It manages to tread that perfect line of being a romance movie without being overly romantic, something that I appreciated as I usually don't really care for romance movies. The story unfolds beautifully and there is never a still moment but all the while not having everything snowball too quickly. I don't think 'movie' fits this film quite correctly, I'd go for 'piece of cinematic art'.There's something so unique about the storyline - it's about that one specific kind of slightly strange, friendship-like, dedicated young love. The two young leads were excellent, and as always I was constant left guessing as to what would happen next. And when those things did happen, I never expected them - that's the beauty of this movie.You have the very classically Wes Anderson-esque symmetrical shots and quirky visuals, you have some nice comedy thrown in, you have some genuinely suspenseful moments. This film is so beautifully crafted and artistically balanced, and it will definitely make you feel warm inside. There's something about Wes Anderson films, they just feel like a visual hug, and throughout the entire movie you manage to go from happy to terrified to crying to crying of laughter, and everything in between.A spectacular piece of cinematic art that will definitely make you smile.-Sasha.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonrise Kingdom...3.5 out of 4 Skittles,"Moonrise Kingdom is easily described in short as a Wes Anderson film. There aren't too many directors in the world where you can simply state their name, and it quickly conjures up the style of film before you even see it, but Anderson is one of the rare few. With his usual weird quirkiness, hilariously bizarre dialog, and offbeat characters Anderson delivers on his reputation as past classics Rushmore, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and The Royal Tenenbaums.Moonrise Kingdom feels like the next chapter in the Wes Anderson life work that he continues to build. His script penned with continued partner Roman Coppola delivers the kind of laughs that run deep and social themes that make the viewer reflect on themselves and their lost childhood.The film's young love story is excellently cast with newcomers Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward in the lead spots. The teen actors easily capture the insanity that goes along with feeling true love at an age when awkwardness and unknowing stupidity fill our minds.The rest of the cast is brilliantly filled in with some of Anderson's usual suspects Bill Murray & Jason Schwartzman along with industry titans Frances McDormand, Bruce Willis, Edward Norton and Tilda Swinton. As always the cast blends in perfectly to showcase life that can only be found inside Anderson's world.Whether you love or hate Wes Anderson's films, he continues to make his mark on the current cinematic scene, and Moonrise Kingdom is no different. Some viewers feel Anderson is one of the only current filmmakers that can be considered a true artist and won't be truly appreciated in his own timeothers simply think he's a hack. I for one am glad to be invited into Anderson's world, and am thankful to be a part of the journeys he continues to deliver.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A live painting,"A movie that is both heartwarming and heartaching (not breaking) at the same time.At first it reminded me of The Grand Budapest Hotel, the way the movie is being filmed with fixed cameras and a variant colored shoots each has it own significant tone depending on the scene.Firstly, the movie has a heartwarming hope-y feel-y atmosphere which was met with a great choice of warm colors like yellow, green, and pink which was the theme color at the first place the two kids met and fell in love from first sight,On the other hand, it ached my heart because it touched a part of me which craves love but he is not sure if he will ever find it, a love that fixes a broken soul and brightness a life with a palette full of sunshine and hope.At the end, I guess this is why we watch movies, to remind us of our own hopes and sorrows, to touch parts of us we try to avoid and hide from, and for that reason I see this movie as Beautiful piece of art.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
beyond boring,"This movie was so boring and awkward I was verging on falling asleep within 30 minutes.At 55 minutes into the film I left the theater. I thought Brice Willis, ed Norton, and Bill Murray working together on a film would ensure a great movie. I guess the producers spent all their money on casting and just settled for a poor script and bad direction. I've never seen a movie with so little emotion and character development.The film moved at a snail's pace with absolutely no intensity, even when the kids turn up missing. The parent's reaction to their missing children is emotionless.don't waste your money",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Oscar for Ed Norton!,"Short Review: Sam is a Khaki Scout (boy scout) in a 1965 New England outpost or island or some such magical little spit of land and time where boys were really boys and girls really ran away from home with Samsonite luggage. Sam is an awkward kid at camp and is certainly the junior version of Corporal Willie Santiago from A Few Good Men (1992). Sam escapes before given a boy scout code red but his former buddies certainly try to make up for it while hunting him down.Suzy is a burnt out romantic tween just dying for someone who is honest in her life. Sam and Suzy hatch an escape and the little New England isle is turned upside down trying to find them and bring them back from their new found lagoon of paradise and innocence to the dirty real world they so wanted to escape. Sam Suzy communicate texting style in a world before cell phones and email. They use hand written notes. So their actions are all contemplative and direct, ...and as impulsive as the world in 1965 allowed given such slow communication.It all sounds benign enough. However, the script is amazingly imaginative and funny. Sam is an odd duck. Suzy is a wild bird. They work well together. The acting is superlative and Ed Norton deserves and Oscar nomination at the least. The under 21 crowd may not have the life, historical or emotional experience to ""get it""---everyone else will. This is an awesome date movie. It is sweet. It is endearing. It is funny and it is great storytelling. It only lacks huge social impact which is why TMG does not give it a 10.0. This movie is too good to spoil for you by a longer review. Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful,"Sam and Suzy are stuck in their own world of young love, and have abandoned all for a trek into the outdoors. The adults organize a search party, which includes Sam's Scout Leaders and Suzy's eccentric parents (Bill Murray is wonderfully melancholic, as usual). While hunted, Sam and Suzy exhibit all the awkwardness of first love's sensual curiosity and idealism. All this occurs under the shadow of an approaching hurricane.Here, Anderson skillfully balances the honest and the fantastical, the commonplace and the bizarre. No matter where the actors fall on those scales, however, we never feel like the actors are acting TO us. There are moments where I audibly laughed, but not as a reaction to a punchline. A huge part of the success of the film, I feel, was the actors' ability to convey a serious innocence that makes you believe what they believe. There are certainly other films that share the indie-feel and quirky film-making of Moonrise Kingdom, but where we see living actors here, we see mannequins elsewhere.The film is accompanied by selections from Benjamin Britten's The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, and Robert D. Yeoman's cinematography is excellent. There really isn't an area of the production team that is seen as lacking. The film is shot with a golden color palette that is not only visually interesting, but aids in its reminiscent and vintage story. Wes Anderson's films are an acquired taste. Don't get me wrong, not like a ""David Lynch"" acquired taste, but there's something oddly simplistic and undiluted about his film-making that doesn't quite resonate with a portion of the audience (which is OK).However, for me, watching this film was akin to finding an old childhood lunchbox in your Grandma's attic. It is a refreshing reminder of the good and bad, and the delightful and uncomfortable, episodes of youth.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A superbly supported Wes Anderson show,"Wes Anderson made moments of weird and awkward look sweet and warm. The photography, dialogues and artwork reminded me of a regional director who took a similar style way back. A similar theme of emotional, calm and thoughtful adolescents vs. knee-jerk, crazy adults has been dealt with by many different filmmakers but this one stands out as a better finished product than most.Sam (Jared Gilman) is an unpopular boy scout absconds from the camp run by strict and kind Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton). A search party involving Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) is dispatched. At the same time they hear that a sad and depressed young girl Suzy (Kara Hayward) goes missing from a nearby town. Soon they realize that they both conspired to escape. Rest is how they spend time, get close and explore each other and what happens when the adults catchup with them.The focus is on the new leads who give a superbly apt performance in the backdrop of lush vistas, creative and unconventional photography and artwork, melodious and blending soundtrack packed with some of the heaviest weights of Hollywood in Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Edward Norton and Tilda Swinton. The opening scene photography and background score introducing the Bishops sets the tone for the oncoming brilliance. Wes Anderson deftly balances the innocence and maturity of the leads especially resonating in a delicate scene which could have easily become vulgar turns out to be warm and comic. The remaining big stars are given enough space to develop their characters written carefully not to overlap each other and they do give their money's worth.A superbly supported Wes Anderson show",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Anderson At His Finest,"You wouldn't be alone in thinking that every Wes Anderson film is much the same. Each one involves family dysfunction, melancholy adults, meticulously planned camera shots, immaculate soundtracks and all, bar one has Bill Murray credited. Yet amongst this recycling of everything his old films consist of, Anderson manages to make his latest venture Moonrise Kingdom fresh, new and somehow completely different.Set on the fictional island of New Penzance, Khaki Scout Sam Shukusky (Jared Gilman) and deadpan dreamer Suzy Bishop (Kara Hayward) fall in love and elope, to live life in the wild, away from their families. On the case to find the two love birds is island police officer Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton) with troop in tow, as well as Suzy's lawyer parents Mr and Mrs Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand). Doesn't sound quite hectic enough for an Anderson film? Then maybe the fact that there is the biggest storm on record heading their way will satisfy that. As with all of Anderson's features though, it never feels cluttered and doesn't dwell on a single moment or problem any longer than it needs to.Moonrise shows two sides of life; on the one hand we have the twelve year old love birds, completely naive of the world ahead and believing they can make it through anything together. The newcomers Gilman and Hayward excel with their ability to express so much emotion and passion from such impassive performances. On the other end of the spectrum we have the adult characters, all of whom are drizzled with sorrow, a sense of opportunities missed and past demons hanging over them.This is no drab, depressing affair however, even at its lowest points the film spews life and energy from every shot and pan of the camera. It's clear each image has been scrupulously thought and rethought so as to achieve the aesthetic pleasure that it does in all of Anderson's ventures. To boot, Francois Hardy, Hank Williams and Benjamin Britten enlighten the soundtrack to accompany the cast throughout their venture perfectly. Although the film isn't without its faults; the remainder of the Khaki troop are underused, and the narration by Bob Balaban seems fairly unnecessary.Moonrise Kingdom is Anderson's second writing collaboration with Roman Coppola (son of Francis Ford) and is much more engaging and heartfelt than their previous outing, The Darjeeling Limited. With such a signature vision it could be easy for Anderson to get caught up in himself and create a self indulgent mess. It would seem he is very aware of this however and stays on the right side of the spectrum making it engaging and entertaining without pushing it to be quirky for the sake of quirk.Part action romp, part romance, part comedy and part coming of age drama; it all adds up to make a wholly captivating film. Despite being arguably the same as every other Anderson film Moonrise Kingdom is anything but.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant movie about kids for adults,"I walked into the theater to watch 'Moonrise Kingdom' without any expectations beyond the lush, sepia-tinted scenery that graces the poster. And while I got plenty of postcard-perfect locales, the film was so much more than just a visual treat.It's a lovely story about the wonders of childhood romances and the grand sense of adventure that all children experience before they are forced to grow up. However, the death of innocence that accompanies that age does rear its ugly heads in portions, with some scenes eerily reminiscent of how adults might react in the same situations. In a sense, it captures children at that time when they're no longer children but not yet adults either.And I think that's the beauty of the film, and the reason we all connect to it so much as adults; it's not a saccharine story, but a quirky one with real characters.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quirky and touching,"This film impresses you within the first sequence, as the camera, fixed to one spot, spins around the various rooms of Suzy's house, with a single piece of music playing multiple times in the background, each time with different instruments. It is this kind of uniqueness that Wes Anderson brings throughout the entire film--in fact, this is definitely one of the most unique and quirky films I've ever seen.It's screenplay was very well-written, and I'd be surprised if it wasn't Oscar nominated come the awards season. The dialogue is frank and to the point, but that somehow adds to the charm of the film, and definitely provides for some comical moments. Most of the story is essentially seen through the eyes of the twelve year-olds, Suzy and Sam, as they both attempt to escape their depressing live and flee into the wild together. They don't necessarily know each other, but they love each other, if that's possible. In fact, they get a little swept away, but I think that's the entire point of the movie: they have nothing that's important in their lives, nothing at all that they care about, except their first crush, so, to them, that's all in the world that matters. Both actors do a great job at portraying kids on the run--they were as realistic as one could be in a situation like that, and really entertaining.All the actors were actually fantastic--for me, the standout was Bruce Willis, who took on an unusual role for him, but did a great job with it. Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Tilda Swinton also all did a good job.This film is definitely not ordinary--it stands out amongst recent ones that I've seen. It's quirky but not too odd, it takes you on a journey but never gets lost. It's realistic in it's character portrayal and development, yet still manages to surprise you with genuine, unique characters that for the most part haven't been seen before, at least not in this context, and definitely not all working together as they somehow managed to do in this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Must see.,"Moonrise Kingdom by Ivette Fred-RiveraI loved the movie, I recommend it.Excellent ambiance of the sixties era, great music used as a narrative element adding drama and rhythm, the use of the reading of the letters by Sam (Jared Gilman) and Susy (Kara Hayward) to show how their friendship as pen pals progresses into love in a linear sequence, actually, excellent performances of both, dynamic and unusual camera angles such as the ones seen when two scenes in different places are presented simultaneously because the screen is visually divided in half, and how we spectators identify with the left side of the screen where the good and concerned characters about the welfare of Sam are located because we have already identified ourselves with orphan Sam! (how could we not)? Exquisite composition and use of light. Very careful visual arrangements to advance the plot. I have to say that the detail of the mother's pin placed in Sam's boy scout uniform is really very moving. Director Wes Anderson is definitely very fond of detail. I want to draw attention to the symbolism in Susy's constant use of binoculars: as she herself explains, 'to be near while being far', and the security that such optical viewpoint provides. With the binoculars placed in her makeup stylish eyes (which gives her a deeper and inquisitive look), she learns at a safe distance about her mother's (Frances McDormand) infidelity with Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis). A question very present is how one can enrich life through fiction, and how life without fiction is not worth living. At the same time, the need for real life adventures. For example, the geography of the island where Susy and Sam escaped seems both real and imaginary. Issues concerning technology are displayed as well. Do we share Susy and Sams' spirit of adventure with our more advanced technology? A very interesting and controversial issue: the insinuation of intercourse between Sam and Susy. The director luckily saves us from watching teen sex, we see their French kissing and touching, so issues of child pornography are bypassed completely. Anderson tells us, with a dose of black humor, of course, that is so present throughout the film, that Sam is already an adult when Captain Sharp offers to him a plate of sausage for dinner in his dining table, and he has none. Captain Sharp tells him that he's more intelligent than most people including himself. He ends up being abandoned by Susy's mother; Susy marries Sam. The guy who marries them looks gay, so another outsider is in. Being a 'misfit' is a matter of degrees, even Captain Sharp is very lonely despite being the captain. The film is about people of different ages, youth, children, adults. It is very well done. Because it gets you to think, of being more tolerant of differences so we can integrate better collectively.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dear Mr. Anderson: Why do most shots in this film have a slight tilt to the side? Mistake?,"Dear Mr. Wes Anderson, Firstly, thank you. What a sweet, beautiful film you have (yet again) created. I will remark that this is the most ""Wes Anderson"" of your films; you have further cemented your own private genre. The characters was touching, the film was inspiring. Thank you.That said, I have a bone to pick. I noticed that about 90% of the shots in this film have a slight tilt to them. And additionally, most of that 90%, the tilt is to the right. What I mean is, if you are looking at the horizon line in a given shot, the horizon on the right is slightly higher than the horizon on the left. It's not the case for the entire film... but it is the case for most of it.What's the deal? At first I thought it was a projection issue where I saw it last night at Arclight Hollywood. Or maybe it was my perspective in the theater (theater-right). But then, upon returning home after thoroughly enjoying your film, I watched the trailer on my computer to confirm or deny my theory. And alas, in most of the shots, I see there is a subtle tilt to the right (though it's harder to notice on a smaller screen). It is most notable when there are man-made structures involved. Such as fences or banisters or walls where you can see the edges.What happened here? For someone who so carefully stages his scenes in a highly symmetrical fashion, I was shocked to discover this imperfection(?). I can't say it removed me from the film: it didn't. I was mesmerized by the story. However, it was like a subtle itch that never went away during the duration of the viewing.I'm guessing this mistake was result of a preoccupied camera operator / steadicam operator with a subconscious bias to the left. And that such mistakes would be difficult to catch on playback monitors on set. However, I find it hard to believe that this issue was not spotted in the viewing of dailies. I am curious to see if you have a response to this. If do, I would appreciate it greatly if you submitted said response to blakekhodges(at) gmail.com - my email.Again, I was once again extremely pleased with the film you have given the world. I expect I will be viewing the film again and again, and recommending it to more of my friends. As for the shot-tilt, we can't expect every film to be technically perfect, although, considering your aesthetic style, I almost do. Anyhow. Thank you again, and please keep up the great work. If you're ever back in LA from your travels, feel free to drop me a line and we will grab a delicious coffee. Thank you.Sincerely, BlakeP.S. If, for your next film, you decided you'd like to try and broaden your style palette, I would not be opposed.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Is Wes's World becoming Clichéd?,"People shunned my review of Richard Ayoade's 'Submarine' because they all thought it was sublime, while I said it was second-rate. The most significant criticism I levelled at it was that it was a blatant rip-off of Wes Anderson's 'Rushmore', made even more blatant by the fact that Ayoade denies the resemblance. The truth is that 'Submarine' rips off Wes's latest more than the other, and 'Moonrise' is mediocre by his standards.It wouldn't be helpful to describe this as 'quirky' because that word has become a synonym for the Anderson brand. It may instead be helpful to say that it is no less quirky than any other title from his repertoire.A khaki scout/orphan called Sam (Jared Gilman) runs away from his group, or 'flies the coup'. At about the same time a depressive girl, Suzy (Kara Hayward), Sam's darling from the previous summer, also leaves her family. Their disappearance in their small island town sparks a frantic but incompetent search while the two dreamers reunite to rekindle their romance.The kids' acting is superb, no doubt about it. They're eight going on 18. Sam utters all the jokes, but they are deeply unfunny, partly because they are intrinsically unfunny and partly (I hate to say) because he has a distracting lisp which means his jokes register too late.The likes of Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton and Harvey Keitel – first-timers in an Anderson film – blend in well enough, though I can't tell if they're in this purely to collect their 'I starred in a Wes Anderson film' t-shirt. They are not part of Wes's world. Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman – both Anderson regulars – feature, but in restricted roles. These two are the lifeblood of most of Wes's films. Without them Wes's films are not the same. (Hand on heart, would you accept a Tarantino film without Sam Jackson?)It's always good to presage an insult with a compliment. Here's mine: Anderson is one of my favourite directors. I place his 'Rushmore' and 'Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' in my top 100. Sadly, though, the man described as 'the next Scorsese' by the maestro himself has been on a downward trajectory ever since 'Zissou'. I disliked 'The Darjeeling Limited' largely because of Adrian Brody's appearance, and I was upset at how much I loathed 'Fantastic Mr. Fox'.We have the same old themes of family breakdown, mid-life crises and pubescent love. The story takes place in the '60s and there's a pervading French motif. Things like these are included, I suspect, to add zest and originality. My only thought was: Is Wes's world, his quirkiness, becoming clichéd?www.moseleyb13.com",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boy meets girl,"This was a perfectly delightful movie. I think Sir James M. Barrie would have enjoyed it, as it has overtones of Peter Pan. Even the title, Moonrise Kingdom, reminds me of the address of Neverland - ""First star on the right, and straight on 'til morning."" Other similarities are many boys and one girl (like the lost boys and Wendy). The story is carried by the kids, not the big stars, although they add to the enjoyment. Every character is sympathetic, if a bit quirky. The plot is fun, the premise is familiar, the scenery is lovely, the acting is terrific. If you are a kid, or ever were a kid, you'll enjoy this movie.

Oh to Be 11 Years Old Again (Would You Really Want To?),"A delicate, effervescent and, above all, sweet film from the formidable cinematic imagination of Wes Anderson.A group of adults played by the likes of Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton join forces (when they're not bickering with one another) to track down a pair of kids who have run off to be together. The film is about the pangs of adolescence and particularly the pangs of being labeled a ""troubled"" adolescent by an adult world that seems to have forgotten that it was once young too. But it's also about the struggles of being an adult role model, wanting to give kids a good example but not always being sure how. The movie illustrates how exhilarating, rewarding, exhausting and -- let's face it -- outright terrifying it is to be a parent or a guardian.It's a beautiful film, one that anchors its facetious and sarcastic style with genuine and honest emotion. There are a couple of quite lovely moments, especially one between Frances McDormand and her daughter and another between Edward Norton's scout leader and one of the boys under his charge, that are tear inducing, but in a sweet, quiet way, not an obvious, shameless one.And it's amazing to both look at and listen to, with some knock your socks off music scored by Alexandre Desplat.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Superb,"This is definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year so far. This movie is about two special kids that fall in love and decide to run away. When the movie starts we are introduced by the narrator to the place where all this happens and get to know some of the characters.

The performance of the two leads are superb and it is even more so because they never acted before! The supporting cast is composed of a number of great starts that have already probed their talent and this is no exception. The music really managed to transport us to a magic place and the visuals make us never want to leave.

Wes Anderson has never been more accessible,"The moment ""Moornise Kingdom"" graces the screen, it is a Wes Anderson film. The first major sequence, the symmetrical exploration of the Bishop house, couldn't be mistaken for any other filmmaker's style — nor could the rest of the film, honestly. So if Anderson is just as divisively quirky as ever, why has ""Moonrise Kingdom"" resonated with audiences more than any of his previous work? Surely it can't just be the absence of any Wilson brothers.In the '60s, on the island of New Penzance somewhere in New England, Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward) have run away together. Sam, a foster child, has ""resigned"" from the Khaki Scouts; Suzy, the fiction-loving elder daughter of the well-off Bishop family, feels isolated and ignored. Their innocent tryst sets the Khaki Scouts, led by Scout Master Ward (Edward Norton), Police Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis) and Mr. and Mrs. Bishop (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) on a search of the island.Anderson wastes no time plunging into this story, to the point where you'll wonder if the film is nearly over when in actuality it's maybe halfway through. The simplicity of two 12-year-olds running away makes it rather engaging, but more importantly there's a sweetness to that notion that creates more of an emotional interest too.That's where you can start to see what makes ""Moonrise Kingdom"" arguably Anderson's best. It's like any other Anderson film in that it deals with family dynamics and the adult characters have serious maturity problems, but it stands out in that Sam and Suzy are the clear main characters. Something about Anderson's style, particularly with his dialogue, works surprisingly well with young characters, possibly because we expect a certain quirkiness and immaturity from kids that can sometimes come off as annoying from the mouths of adults. It's in part what made his breakthrough film ""Rushmore"" so good.Gilman and Hayward were cast exceptionally well too. Sam is incredibly smart for his age but has a naive confidence that Gilman pulls off as a dorky-looking kid capable of sharp facial expressions. Hayward, done up like young Margot Tenenbaum, has the look of a pretty young girl yet to come into her own who's rather reserved but capable of surprising things (like violence). They're an odd match, but they completely capture the notion of young, curious love that will guaranteed bring back those kinds of memories for viewers.The adults aren't forgettable, but in supporting roles it maximizes their funny factor. They're completely ignorant to the needs of the kids and though they chastise Sam and Suzy's romance, they fare no better themselves. We can laugh at them as well as with them. For those wondering about Willis, his reserved manner of speaking, even in action films, makes him a great fit for Anderson.""Moonrise Kingdom"" has a ""Romeo & Juliet"" quality to it as well, from the prologue that warns of an impending storm to hit New Penzance to Bob Balaban's other inserted transitions as the narrator. This contrasts but also enhances the film's cheeky tone: the relationship between the kids is the sincere and genuine core around which the rest of the film's quirkiness gravitates. We experience a vested interest in the outcome that's regularly interrupted by Anderson's shenanigans. It's a constant back-and-forth of cinema and fairy tale but not in a jarring sense, which is what has made Anderson a stand-out director of the last 15 or so years.Those who have always identified with Anderson and love most of his films might not find much difference between ""Moonrise"" and the rest of his resume, but those who struggle with ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and ""The Life Aquatic"" to some extent will find something extremely refreshing about ""Moonrise Kingdom."" Frankly, it's his most accessible film (unless you count the family-geared ""Fantastic Mr. Fox""): the story his most straightforward, his dry humor at its punchiest.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Will not disappoint!,"If you are an Anderson fan, one who ""gets"" the subtle humor in each awkward situation, this movie will not disappoint. The acting from Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, Bill Murray, and Jason Schwartzman is an absolute delight. Of course the children stars do an excellent job as does the entire remaining cast. As suggested by others, this movie is also like visual eye candy. Some scenes extend beyond reality just a tad only to bring you something extraordinarily fun to watch. Unlike Anderson's other movies this one brings elements of cute, fun, and innocence which balance out the ever eluding emotion of depression common to his films.

Sheer Charm!,"Wes Anderson's latest delivers a beautiful and sweet depiction of first love. The film, with its whimsical humor conveys the tale of twelve-year- old lovers Sam and Suzy perfectly. The children who deliver great performances as youngsters bumbling through their first romance are surrounded by a fantastic cast which includes Frances McDormand, Bill Murray (whom is always best directed by Anderson), Harvey Keitel, Bruce Willis and Tilda Swinton as Social Services. I have heard many complaints of the kissing scene which has already had much buzz of discomfort, but in reality the scene is very touching and sweet in its awkward innocence. This film, which admittedly is a tale of puppy love, is beautiful, charming, and simply very sweet. It is most certainly Mr. Anderson's best work to date and it is a must see!

someone was nostalgic about his/her childhood,"While watching Moonrise Kingdom, i had the feeling that the person who wrote it (or envisioned it) was actually nostalgic about his/her childhood. Because, despite all insecurities and difficulties portrayed, there has been a layer sweet melancholy beneath. As if the author wanted to go back to those years and relive them and not necessarily change them.The cast is just fine and the plot will keep you going, but if i'd need to retell the story i probably wouldn't be able to. I would only say that it is a story about growing up in a time that was harmless in comparison to today's circumstances.Moonrise Kingdom is a nice pastime, but neither a masterpiece nor a must-see.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A wonderful, romantic, and uniquely odd Wes Anderson film","With Wes Anderson, you either buy into his odd, very idiosyncratic and distinctive style, with it's touches of twisted, surreal fairy-tale tone, and performances that are both restrained on yet not at all naturalistic – or you don't. For me, I find his style almost always endearing, and both very funny and very touching (The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou was the one time it didn't work for me).As always the performances here are remarkable from Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray (the quintessential Wes Anderson actor), Francis McDormand and Tilda Swinton as the adults, to two luminous and unique performances by the film's pre-adolescent lovers Kara Haywood and Jared Gilman.While imposing a seemingly astringent style, all right angles (almost every cut within a scene is at 90 degrees or 180 degrees to the shot before it), and carefully composed tableaux, this film captures the wonderful, surreal weirdness of first love (or at least one's childhood fantasy of first love) with a moving and hilarious honesty.Somehow, while the story of Sam and Suzy's attempt to escape from the insane adult world that surrounds them has little to do with the realities of day to day life as we know it, it has everything to do with the realities of the budding heart.I can't remember when a film so reminded me of my own first fantasies of love and (tasteful but honest) sexuality. I love when a film makes a tear fall from my eye at the same time I'm laughing, and that's the rare trick Anderson has accomplished here.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wes Anderson has crafted his most personal venture yet.,"One of the most acclaimed and celebrated movies of the year, Moonrise Kingdom might very well be Wes Anderson's best movie to date. It's probably his most accessible movie yet, but that doesn't mean he tones down his usual quirky style and humor. His personal stamp is ever so present throughout, his directorial choices a delight, and his cast (including Bruce Willis, Edrward Norton, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, and Bill freakin' Murray) are an absolute riot.Most enchanting, however, is Anderson's delicate, layered script. The movie's charm never seems to fade, but he still manages to confront issues of first love, bullying, emotional damage, and social isolation without missing a beat. It may be a funny movie, but it still resonates deeply as a study of childhood. Moonrise Kingdom serves as a project lovingly perfected by Anderson, and what he crafts - complete with gorgeous photography and music - is one of the very best films of the year.****1/2 / *****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The purity of young love is a wonderful thing,"Moonrise Kingdom is an American film directed by Wes Anderson, who co-wrote the the script with Roman Coppola. It's set on a pastoral Island of New England called New Penzance in the year 1965.Incorporating Anderson's signature style of deliberate, methodical cinematography and lush tones the film explores the theme of young love set against the backdrop of an eccentric cast of characters and Arcadian locations.Twelve year old orphan Sam Shakusky disappears from the ""Khaki Scout"" summer camp, much to the chagrin of its leader, Scout Master Ward, and less so of his peers who find him to be a capricious sort and a Island wide search is put into place. Suzy Bishop, a deeply stoical young lady who lives with her parents and three siblings is the Juliet to Sams Romeo. The previous summer the pair met an subsequently became pen pals, through their correspondence they hatch a plan to reunite the following summer and run away together. Utilizing Sam's keen skills learnt as a scout they ambulate the Islands country side with the aim of reaching a secluded cove that they wistfully name Moonrise Kingdom.The film is headed by an ensemble cast of veritable A-listers including Bruce Willis, as the Islands police captain, Ed Norton, who plays the fastidious scout master, as well as Bill Murray and Frances McDormand who play Suzy's lawyer parents. The list goes on, Harvey Keitel crops up, Jason Schwartzman appears for a hilarious turn, but it's the films protagonists Sam and Suzy, played by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward that quite literally steal the show. Their controlled performances are mature far beyond their years, and the pathos they bring to the roles are simply astonishing. Wes Anderson manages to extract an incredible enactment of young love and precocious sentiments from the two fledgling actors. Fans of Anderson will not be disappointed, this film incorporates all the trademark quirkiness and whimsy that have made him popular amidst film lovers. From the excellent script and funny dialogue, to the wistful setting and outstanding cinematography, as well as fine turns from all actors involved, this film is a joy to watch and an incredibly sweet tale of burgeoning love between two adolescent outcasts who find solace in one anothers company.It also demonstrates the power of empathy and the need to belong and the importance of learning to overlook ones prejudices and preconception in others.

A great Feel-Good Movie,"I was actually really, really looking forward to this movie. Not because Wes Anderson directed it though. I know he's like a really popular director, but I haven't seen any of his movie until now. I was exited because I had heard so many great reviews, how it was the best film of 2012 so far, and...well actually that's about it. I never read why it was so good, I just sort of assumed it would make me cry. That was sort of a mistake, the film isn't one that sets out to make you cry. It actually is more of a feel good movie, and while it doesn't reach the levels of something like Forrest Gump or Slumdog Millionaire, it's still a damn good film.I think one of the main things that took me out of the story was that I just didn't feel that the two kids were really in love. The kids weren't bad actors, but their relationship just feels forced at times, I wish I had more time to know how they met and what their similar interests are. Part of me thinks that was kind of the point, that the kids aren't really in love and just want to act rebellious, but part of me also thinks it was supposed to be serious. And why does Suzy never smile, Bella Swan smiles more than her. I get that she a bit disturbed and stuff, but would it kill her to smile. Plus Anderson's directon got a little annoying at times. Not much, it certainly has a very interesting style (I'm assuming) but sometimes it got a little annoying.But while I didn't really care about the realationship as much as I wanted to, I did really like these kids. They're very likable, don't deserve some of the stuff that happens to them, or what the adults want to do to them, and were portrayed well. It's downright hilarious at times. Bill Murray has still got it, I LOL'D several times in the movie, sometimes at jokes, sometimes at the cheap special effects, or how absurd some things are. This movie gets pretty damn adult, and I know it's PG-13, but half the time it plays out like a PG or even G. There's quite a bit going on, and it doesn't feel rushed for a movie that's only an hour and a half long. And it looks very nice, I'm not going to seek out the rest of Anderson's movies, but if I catch one on TV, or find one cheap, I'll check them out.I had this movie wrong, I expected a serious drama, when it's really a coming of age film, and for what it is, it works really well. Sure the realationship feels a little forced, and it can be annoying at times. But it's hilarious, and leaves you with a good feeling. Not my favorite of the year, but pretty good.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

A endearing film with beautiful visual storytelling,"Moonrise Kingdom, directed by Wes Anderson, is a beautifully shot and acted movie about self-discovery and acceptance. Mr. Anderson is a critically acclaimed director who was nominated for six Academy awards and won numerous other awards, including the BAFTA award for The Grand Budapest Hotel. Moonrise Kingdom, nominated for best original screenplay, stars two 12 year olds, finding their bearings among a small island community. They run away to be with each other; escaping those who misunderstand them. 
The theme of freedom and self-discovery shows in a scene where the two kids, Suzy and Sam, finally reach their destination: a beach they name Moonrise Kingdom. There, they remove their clothes and jump into the water, representing washing away what they used to be and becoming who they want to be. After this, they seem to open up more, dancing and even just enjoying each other's company. This supports the concepts presented because until this scene, they were running from everyone unable to fully relax, but here they can be themselves. 
The plot succeeds with the main focus, Suzy and Sam. The chemistry between the characters is believable and sweet, because they are very serious about each other. For example we learn they were pen pals and over the course of the letters they bonded over shared experiences. Their relationship seems odd, but not to them. Both act mature for their age; perhaps because they are outsiders in some way, Sam is an orphan and Suzy is seen as a ""troubled child"". The part of the plot that didn't work for me were the scenes with a narrator. Neither the narration nor the narrator have a real purpose and don't reveal anything the viewer could not figure out on their own. It sucked me out of the story and didn't really seem to fit. 
The acting also plays a big part in successes of the plot. The dialog between the main characters doesn't always sound natural, but it contributes to the atmosphere of the film. The characters do not talk as a normal child would, with lots of emotion and without much thought, but speak in a withdrawn and calculated way. The cinematography is excellent: each shot appears carefully planned. A visual theme that particularly caught my attention is the repeated use of binoculars, conveying Suzy as someone who is watching others from the outside, isolating herself. A tracking shot through Suzy's house conveys the separation of the family. 
In summary, this is an excellent film and a must-see for viewers who enjoy an endearing journey with engaging visual storytelling.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Capturing the Rose-Tinted Lenses of Childhood.,"This is a film that illustrates the coming-of-age of two children with real charm.The script is both accurate to life and thoughtful: it is possible to see the innocent reasoning between these two characters, who are well developed and yet completely unique. Some lines were equipped to make me squirm in my seat with the delight of their naive wisdom. The actors each encompass the quirks of their character, while making them just believable. Adding to this, the editing is to the second, creating a sense of wit throughout the film, that creates youthful entertainment. This, alongside the beauty of the scenery and camera shots, provided the strange sense that I was within the fairytale these two children had created for themselves.A definite film to see if you are in the mood for a lighthearted film that left me with the sense I had just grown up with these two young and insightful characters, that managed to illuminate some truths an adult may overlook. I finished with the inescapable feeling that I had experienced a summer as filled with adventure as theirs was.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Journey into Young Love,"Moonrise Kingdom is like a breath of fresh air, a vibrant burst of color and imagination in a world that can often feel dull and mundane.

Their budding romance is like a delicate flower blooming amidst the rocky shores and windswept cliffs, defying the expectations of their parents and the rigid social norms of their small island community.

The limits of charm,"There is undeniable charm in Wes Anderson's established style: sets like dollhouses, candy-colored design, formalized symmetry, and painterly camera work with occasional tracking shots. But here's where I jump ship: deadpan delivery from the actors. All the actors. Perhaps Anderson believes, as some directors are rumored to (von Sternberg, Mamoulian, Clarence Brown), that when actors are blank the audience supplies the emotion. That's a big risk, especially inside Anderson's already rigid aesthetic.Consider Dr. Seuss, another artist with a fanciful yet rigid aesthetic. Like classic fairy tales, his stories are imbued with wisdom and metaphor and poetic genius. But Anderson's style is a quirky cosmetic for minor storytelling gifts. In fact, Dr. Seuss's printed pages are actually more dynamic than Anderson's motion pictures.""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a case in point. The plot centers on two humorless twelve-year-old runaways with troubled lives. There are a few amusing lines (""Our daughter's been abducted by one of these beige lunatics!"") and a few thoughtful ones, e.g., when the girl says she wished she was an orphan, the boy replies, ""I love you but you don't know what you're talking about."" The deadpan delivery works for that line; unfortunately, all the dialog is delivered that way, minus any of the messy emotions that make us human.Sometimes, happily, talented actors manage to ply their craft inside those aesthetic limitations. Encased in a code-blue uniform, Tilda Swinton brings a crisp authority to her role as Social Services. Equally irrepressible, Bruce Willis emerges as the most human character in the bunch, with nothing more than the practiced use of pauses and inflections, evidently the maximum display of human nature that Anderson will allow.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Blessed with all the traits, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a welcome entry into the Wes Anderson canon and another landmark film from him for my life.","I'm a huge fan of Wes Anderson. Back when I was getting into films The Royal Tenenbaums, which I initially mistook for a Dodgeball style frat pack film but I liked it anyway, has always been a consistent entry in my top list. Over the years, it's unfolded more as I've understood more about film. The Darjeeling Limited blew me away when I saw it on my 15th birthday, despite my family not liking it. As my first Anderson in the cinema, it resonated with me so deeply that it remains not far from it's initial #4 of all-time position just outside my top 10. Rushmore was a deeply relatable film for me in Max Fisher's character and although I wasn't a big fan the first time, it's blossomed to becoming a masterpiece. I had a similar reaction to The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, wherein I thought it was great but too messy to be a favourite, but it was only recently where the film now makes me cry like a baby. Fantastic Mr. Fox was always my favourite Roald Dahl book so I was delighted when Anderson adapted it and he lived up to the promise. It's not as perfect as the other films but it's just as watchable.So when I heard about Moonrise Kingdom, it's very difficult to not get my expectations too high. Despite The Darjeeling Limited and Fantastic Mr. Fox being immediately likable, all his other most rewarding films had to unfold for me to be favourites. But as all those films spookily echo landmarks in my life, Moonrise Kingdom was already destined to do so as well. It was the first film I saw in person with my long-distance girlfriend and the day after our first kiss. Considering the plot of Moonrise and how it's dedicated to Anderson's own girlfriend, it's a film that already means a lot to me. It just has to. This is a very late review, by the way, I saw this in June and I've struggled to review it ever since. I want to review everything from 2012 before the Oscars hence why I'm doing it today on my third viewing. Moonrise Kingdom has all the traits of a Wes Anderson film. Meticulous production design and costume design, a old school mixed-tape soundtrack, family troubles, lovers with obstacles and a wonderful quirky sense of humour. As ever, these are always a delight to watch.But in essence, it's very different to his other films. While those films were often the aftermath of a rich tragic backstory, Moonrise Kingdom's backstory is deliberately cut short, as if a future film will be consequential of the events of this film. While Margot and Richie Tenenbaum ran away to the library in their youth, this is a beautiful insight into the childlike yet mature nature of his characters. It feels like the animated style of Fantastic Mr. Fox has fed into how Anderson now approaches his films. Moonrise Kingdom has a very cartoon-like nature, not only in the laboured details wherein every tree feels laid out specifically for this film but in actual cartoon intercuts used for dramatic effect - such as the flash of scissors and arrows in the fight scene, stop motion map intercuts and the very clear model where the dam breaks. As with The Life Aquatic, there's an even more prominent use of the Fellini-esque set pieces and props as the camera scans wide canvases to compromise for the lack of wide lenses. The choice of 16mm film here balances out the feeling of authenticity even if it sacrifices richness in image.From the moment I saw the poster and plot it was clear that this is going to be one of Anderson's most distinct love letters to one of his favourite periods in cinema history - the French new wave. With its 1965 setting and lovers-by-the-beach plot, it's specifically influenced by Pierrot Le Fou, Godard's masterpiece. The pop art and postmodernism has always been a very obvious influence on Anderson's style, but here it's approached almost directly (there's a moment with blood on scissors). Everything about the film captures that 60s essence beautifully without being needlessly nostalgic. Young actors Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman seem born to be in a Wes Anderson film and outshine their star-studded supporting cast - though Edward Norton seems born for this world too. However, some of the film's crucial moments are quite clunky in execution, such as how Sam and Suzy met, their first fight, Sam getting struck by lightning and the film's bizarre climax. Perhaps they are deliberately awkward but fortunately, it's slowly unfolding with more viewings. The cycle begins again with The Grand Budapest Hotel, which already looks like a masterpiece.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Wes Anderson awakens this feeling of nostalgia of discovery of love in a story constructed with care, in a perfect example of a style that enriches the content of a film","North American filmmaker Wes Anderson, since his debut feature film, ""Bottle Rocket (1996)"", and, above all, from his next film, ""Rushmore (1998)"", has been building a work with a singular unit. Full of idiosyncrasies, which can be interpreted by the quickest as stylistic mannerisms, his films also reveal, title after title, the imagination of a singular storyteller, all populated by eccentric and marginal characters.This proposal to forge a universe of its own reaches a high point with the delicious dramatic comedy ""Moonrise Kingdom (2012)"". The plot takes place in the mid-1960s, on a small island located off the coast of New England. In their early teens, Sam (Jared Gilman), an orphaned boy who keeps switching adoptive families due to adjustment problems, and Suzy (Kara Hayward), a sensitive girl who loves reading but doesn't really like people, feel displaced, real fish out of water. And they fall in love. After meeting, by chance, in a play about Noah's Ark in which Suzy acts, the couple begins to correspond regularly. Until the day they decide to run away together. Much to the dismay of Suzy's parents (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and the chief scout, Ward (Edward Norton), who supervises the group that Sam is part of and with which he is installed in a camp on the island.With its eternal uncomfortable interaction between the characters, always melancholic and introspective, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" explores the saga of Sam and Suzy in discovering the bittersweet taste of first love, along with the consequences that come with the behavior of adults in preventing this love, whether due to insecurity or distrust of a conservatism that is sometimes understandable and sometimes cruel. When the other scouts go in search of Sam (in order to have him back as an object of fun in their evil ways), Suzy uses her violence and complicates their lives. In the greatest proof that children can, indeed, bring evil within them, we have the unhappiness of the marriage of Laura and Walt (who refer to each other by the profession they occupy: lawyers) counterbalanced by the sweetness of Sharp (Willis, correct) and Ward (Norton, impeccable as the senior scout, in all his characterization of a fop nerd who has matured on the outside and seems to have forgotten to grow up on the inside).With curious details and mannerisms, we have Suzy and her binoculars, Sam and his pipe. She, with makeup and a hard facial expression, he with large glasses, a sweet look and an appearance that borders on feminine. At first, the couple does not create empathy at first, but captivates the viewer as the plot unfolds, which little by little scrutinizes lonely personalities, overlooked by a world that has forgotten the pains and delights of being a child. And, alone in the middle of a green world (the film was filmed in the natural landscapes of Rhode Island), Sam, an excellent scout, survives with Suzy (although they retain childish attitudes into adulthood). Alone, they meet, they feel like they are each other's safe haven, in a routine of fishing, discovering beautiful places, reading around the campfire, talking about their own importance in the world. Sam's goal, in fact, is to get to the Old Chickchaw Migration Harvest to camp and hide from the real world. A world where children are not so pure (perhaps they shouldn't be) and the piercing in Suzy's ears becomes a kind of devirgination, in a mix of pain and pleasure. And Anderson, in a script written by him and Roman Copolla (brother of Sofia Copolla and son of veteran Francis Ford Copolla), manages to create passages masterfully without falling into vulgarity or laughability (like the scene in the first - and daring - kiss between the little couple).However, perhaps the main connection between the production and its cinematographic relatives lies in Wes Anderson's characteristic aesthetic sense, which in addition to the traveling shots, sequence shots and color palette, employs detail shots of letters and magazines, songs that combine melancholy and nostalgia and, of course, invests in centralized compositions that here suggest more of an obsessive-compulsive disorder on the part of the director than a plastic choice. And if the production design understandably invests in the director's favorite colors (yellow, orange and red), it also deserves to be highlighted for creating sets that, although convincing in their own way, often refer to illustrations from children's books - something highlighted by the beautiful photography of Robert D. Yeoman, Anderson's regular collaborator, who here composes striking images such as the one that shows the lighthouse next to the small post office and a car in a misty environment or the one that occurs at the climax of the projection and features only the silhouettes of the characters.Equally interesting is observing the filmmaker's intelligence in adopting an intriguing approach, since the narrative seems to be entirely staged from a child's point of view: it's no surprise that the treehouse appears impossibly high, that Suzy's mother's betrayal it seems to be limited to a few cigarettes smoked in the company of the lover and the loss of virginity is represented through the obvious (but innocent) symbolism of pierced ears that leak a long trickle of blood. In fact, Anderson is also skilled in portraying the main couple's discovery of sexuality in a way that is simultaneously frank, sweet and innocent, contrasting it with the sad tiredness of the girl's parents, who at one point lead a sad and mature conversation. In their accurate perception of the lack of passion and joy in their lives.Behind all the color (the photography emphasizes shades of green), the cartoonish characters and the progression marked by the artificial, there is a series of articulations that support the film, preventing it from falling into the zone of simply observing the weird. An example of this is the criticism embedded in the behavior of pre-adolescents who's mental (or emotional) age is higher than that of somewhat childish adults. The scenes of the boys talking in an almost solemn tone are priceless, as is the one in which Sam and Suzy discover each other's bodies, between groping and erections. They serve as a counterpoint, the posed rectitude of the scout leader, and the, to say the least crazy, marital dynamics of the lawyers. In the cast, the presence of children, protagonists and secondary characters, themselves, from what we read on the Internet, prototypes of Wes Anderson characters, has a lot to do with this new vitality. Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, the two young actors who play the romantic couple and fugitive, are absolutely remarkable, in their absolute dedication, in the passion that infects the rest of the film, supplanting the heavyweights Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel (some, admittedly, relegated to secondary roles; but this is a children's film, the point of view is theirs, just remember the binoculars). They are the ones who lend the (adolescent) ardor, more or less violent, that is installed in ""Moonrise Kingdom"". Never, in Wes Anderson's films, had sexuality, even if groping and juvenile, been like this: fiery and impetuous. The thing is, despite what was written above, the director authorizes the dam to burst (figuratively and emotionally).In this non-sense universe, of art direction and well-finished costumes, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" appears in the filmography of children's films for grown-ups, such as ""Where the Wild Things Are"" and ""Hugo Cabret"", just to name the most recent. From the fantastic environment, with camera shots that look like paintings, we already have a pure intelligence in the prologue, in which the characters appear quickly as if they were musical instruments, in an analogy of being an orchestra that works together and in tune. The camera, meanwhile, scrutinizes the house through the cracks, as well as children in their intrinsic curiosity. And ending even better than it started, despite being rushed, we have an epilogue with a chase across the city's rooftops in black and white and amidst the storm, with a strong visual impact. And many of us, literate with the love stories with happy endings from Walt Disney's fables, observe real love, with all its bitterness and sweetness composing a sincere, poetic film with children's feet that oscillate between the adult ground and the air. From childhood. Furthermore, it is pleasurable to see the cohesion of Anderson's filmography through the perception that the universe seen here fits perfectly into that created throughout his other works - and it is inevitable to realize that Sam, Suzy and Captain Sharp inhabit a world that also includes Max Fischer, the Tenenbaums and Steve Zissou (in fact, the filmmaker makes clear references to his previous films at certain moments: the narrator played by Bob Balaban wears a costume similar to Zissou's and the animals from The Fantastic Mr. Fox are seen in the costumes worn by children).""Moonrise Kingdom"" represents a nostalgic visit to our first brushes with love, when the discovery that we are capable of yearning for another person and being ecstatic or devastated by our interactions with them ends up, in a certain way, shaping the way that we will deal with relationships and passions throughout our lives. And it is charming that Wes Anderson manages to awaken this feeling of deep nostalgia in a story constructed with care (as indicated by the reference to Noah in the first act) and delicacy, in a perfect example of a style that not only enriches the content, but also shows itself essential to this.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Heir to the Throne,"Truly, if you've seen one Wes Anderson film, you've seen them all. Moonrise Kingdom is just one of the many deadpan classics of the Anderson catalogue. Nobody can set up a frame better than him. Nobody could write a script as eclectic. Nobody can make better use of a cast of Hollywood favorites. Moonrise Kingdom has all of what we love about Wes Anderson and more. The coming- of-age tale fits his universe fantastically. He knows how to make the conventional seem completely unconventional. Sometimes, it's too quirky for it's own good. But that is the risk you take with Wes Anderson. Either you get it, or you don't.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonrise Serenade,"At first 'Moonrise Kingdom' seems to try too hard to be eccentric and often has a very stagey quality, no doubt deliberately, which characteristics mark it unmistakably as the work of Wes Anderson. There are a couple of moments in the third act that stretch the audience's willing credulity, but it would be a heartless viewer who was not willing to forgive these flights of fancy, which highlight the film's fairy-tale quality, reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands or The Truman Show, and are consistent with the Am-Dram sensibility running through it. The film's greatest strength is a heart of pure gold, a delightful melding of the innocence and earnest enthusiasm of Arthur Ransom's 'Swallows and Amazons' with the sassy grit and knowing irreverence of Tarantino's 'True Romance'. The central relationship is delightful, his-and-hers quirks and skewed affectations of adulthood, not in the least annoying (which is an achievement), a tribute to the work put in by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward in the central roles. Edward Norton is outstanding (we expect no less) and Bruce Willis' turn is nicely understated. Tilda Swinton is also a standout, and thankfully used sparingly, otherwise her character would have overpowered the gentler souls around her. Other Anderson stalwarts are also present, including stalwart-in-chief, Bill Murray, and erstwhile leading lad Jason Schwartzman. At only 94 minutes, it's tempting to expect that the film would feel lightweight, but the arc of the story is well served by the film's compactness, and by the time it reaches the end there is nothing left unsaid. Moonrise Kingdom deserves to be considered among Wes Anderson's finest work, and there are plenty of characters here to root for. Hooray for Uncle Wes! Sandwiches and ginger beer all round!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
: A beautiful and captivating movie to watch!,"The plot of the movie is very simple, a couple of kids that escape from statu-quo, searching new experiences and to live freely without any attachments in the place they would like to. However, apart from being a simple history, the director -Wes Anderson- has done an amazing job in how to present this drama. The movie achieved astounding aesthetics, beautiful landscape photography, very good acting and a soundtrack that mix everything into one concise picture. The scenes from this movie was so charming that it could transport you back to your childhood bringing a lot emotions and memories.

One of Wes Anderson's best films in my opinion.,"I love this film. Aside from being a wonderful step backward in time and sensibility regarding young love, the subtle comedic elements and almost lighter than air dramatic scenes make for a very well balanced piece of cinema. Once again Mr. Anderson has used colors to such a degree that they help set the mood by helping to put the viewer in a certain time-oriented frame of mind and help draw the audience into the story. If you look at his body of work you will see his use of yellow hues and oranges and bright colors rather than muted pastels give each of his films a captivating element of visual vibrancy and style. The blues and sea greens of ""A Life Aquatic"" help set the tone for that film as do the earth tones and bright yellows of ""Moonrise Kingdom"" aid in setting the mood for the ""innocence lost"" tone of that film. From ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"", ""The Royal Tenenbaums"" and even ""Bottle Rocket"", each film uses color, or the conspicuous absence of color to great effect in helping tell the tale of the film. Wes Anderson's use of color in his films is one of the reasons that I appreciate his work and eagerly look forward to his future projects! I've deliberately kept this ""review"" short and have only scratched the surface of this wonderful film. I could go on for pages about other details of this film and why, in my opinion, ""Moonrise Kingdom"" should be lauded for it's excellence and used in teaching cinema to new aspiring filmmakers for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
As bad as it can get,"As usual Wes Anderson's army of voters skew the votes on IMDb to push his latest movie. Of course in time the ratings will drop as with all of his other ""masterpieces"" but at the time of this writing it's still glorious 8.3.How much it's really worth? 1, maybe 2 for Willis and Norton performances that were really solid. Leading child actors are bad and their script is even worse, they are like 2 kids heavily sedated forced to move around and speak lines. That might be Anderson's idea of quirky characters but it's just dull, pointless and boring. We had 2 gloomy kids in summer camp in Addams Family Values and it made more sense and was infinitely more funny. So, this is NOT a comedy. It may be a boring children drama, except there is no plot - you have two main characters going from one spot to another (repeat that 3 times) and others just following them.There is absolutely no value at all in this movie. Putting kids in front of the camera to french-kiss, touch each other and talk dirty might be ""artistic"" in Anderson's head, but talentless writers often reach into cultural taboos trying to seem original, just showing a bad taste instead. Don't be tricked by rating, this is just like Darjeeling Limited - a plain bad over-hyped piece of trash. Willis and Norton characters are somewhat interesting as a starting point, and that's what probably drives most of the crowd into cinema to pay for this disaster.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Majority wins,I loved the 1960's and I loved the direction of this movie. At first I was taken back and it started more like a clip from a song but that was its style. The photography was brilliant and I like how you had to work out what it was all about. Perhaps they could have simplified it and added more words but to me that would have ruined it. I liked the innocence of the two stars first love and it makes you think back to your first kiss or talking to a girl or boy. All the kids acted exactly how kids react. It was dark humor and when mix that with the age of the stars it is controversial. I thought those days are long gone as it seems today talking about your first love or children thinking about love is a taboo but I am glad they still do movies in all parts of life.... from being born .... growing up .... being teenager to middle age and of course growing old.True there will be haters and i understand that but the majority wins .... and i am glad more liked it than not.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wes Anderson-esque whimsical melancholy,"Never take Anderson's movie settings at face value, plus it comes with a Coppola team up - there will be themes of adolescence & exploration on innocence for sure.Aesthetics is very Wes Anderson through and through. The colors are usually bright and gradates to a darker shade, from colors of bright autumn to a late autumn palette, marking the beginning of the end of childlike purity & innocence, and thrust into entering adolescence and experiencing the complexity of life that leads up to an even more complex adulthood, from binary to multilayered.Although whimsical and seemingly light hearted, it is cerebral and hits the heart, deep. The pure love & happiness juxtaposed against dysfunctional loveless familial relationships, we've all been through the sensation of pure love - how Sam and Suzy run away together and created their own kingdom, that is so cute but so sad. After a day in their fantastical kingdom, only to be yanked back to reality by adults that have been desensitized to curiosity, freedom, and innocence.The ending may seem happy, but there is a tone of melancholy & sadness to it. Especially the painting of the no longer existent Moonrise Kingdom, it is a beautiful memory but it is also signifies the loss of innocence, forever gone, only to live in their memories. The sad-eyed Suzy gives Sam a look with less of a smile as he climbs out the window, the way Suzy lingered before leaving the room for dinner... Are they already drifting apart?",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amaizeing,"Nostalgic, wholesome and cute. Personally not Wes Anderson's best, but I did thoroughly enjoy it.The whole tone and beautiful theme of the film I will remember. It's incredibly stylised like all Wes's films but this one makes me want to leave everything and camp on a pebble beach.The use of colour in this film is fantastic. Many yellows and greens contrasting the blue hour and popping reds. Shooting 16mm worked brilliantly with a warm look/filmstock to achieve this nostalgic summer feel. Many compositions and shots are going to stick in my mind. Might contend as top 10 cinematography wise.The performances are of course different in Wes's films. I always enjoy it, however I think the pacing in the end made it not feel as tight.The music is subtle here, but like everything Desplat does, it's intentional. It doesn't really stick out, but it truly fit the film that you don't notice it, which I think is a good thing.If you like Wes, you'll like this. It's fun with a great cast as per usual with a stylistic edge you will find from noone else.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely beautiful! Moonrise Kingdom reminds us that film-making is an art.,"I enjoyed Moonrise Kingdom. The only other Wes Anderson movie I've seen before is The Darjeeling Limited. I liked that one as well. His movies are very artistic and thought-provoking. They're just so rich visually and really inspire a series of emotions from the viewer. They're both funny and sad. I plan to watch more of them. I've heard the The Royal Tenenbaums is really good as well.Anyways, Moonrise Kingdom... what can I say? I felt that the previews were slightly misleading in that they focused on the all-stars of the cast: Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Frances McDormand and Bill Murray. Though each of them played a key role in the story, and were brilliant in their roles, it really was about the children. Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman delivered brilliant performances as the troubled twelve- somethings, Suzy and Sam. They really captured the awkwardness of preteen-dom, having all the hormones and curiosities of a teenager while still stuck in a childish body. I see both Hayward and Gilman going far with their careers. They, along with the rest of the cast, were casted brilliantly in this film.I think what I loved most about Moonrise Kingdom though was the beauty of the film. Every shot was just so darn beautiful. There was so much color and dimension. Wes Anderson really sticks to a specific color palette in this film which provides a wonderful sense of unity and harmony through the movie. I really loved all the yellows and golds. Bold colors for a bold film I think. The Director of Photography really pulled out all the stops as well with his choice of shots and angles. Every scene was an intricate painting. It's movies like Moonrise Kingdom that make me appreciate the art of making movies so much. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Even without gushing over the artistic merit of it, there is something in it for everyone I think.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

If you don't get Wes Anderson films...,"If you don't get Wes Anderson, why are you watching and trashing his films. He has a motif that personifies youth and innocense, wonder and nativity.

All of his films are less than perfect, but they all add something that you don't get from the normal executive committee Hollywood tripe. He's an artist. If you don't like art films, then please don't watch Wes Anderson. If you like looking at the world from a fresh perspective and appreciate unique perspectives and artistic vision, then please do watch and enjoy.For me I don't care for drug use and irreverance for all authority in his fims, but that's a small part and a particular perspective, not worthy of trashing an entire work of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
True Idealized Teenage Dream and Pure Human Emotion Expression,"The theme of the movie is very pure, cleanly originated from the mind of teenagers.

It is a simple love story, but it proves how unique are we human beings. The movie was beautifully portrayed, with the tone, the atmosphere, the moving, the realistic, the lines dressing the speaking eyes of the young actors.

nsafieh,The movie is about a pair of young lovers escape and cause the local search party to find them. Anderson's movies are very different from the others. He created his own style. People in his movie have distinctive characters. You feel like reading a comic book when watching his movies. He is an expert of colors and he always put people right in the middle of the screen to make the picture seems naïve.

Delightful movie that celebrates first love and human kindness,"I caught ""Moonrise Kingdom"" on my on-demand service, and I selected this movie because I enjoyed some of Wes Anderson's earlier films, such as ""Rushmore"" and ""The Royal Tenenbaums."" This film's themes, characterizations, music, and whimsical, somewhat surreal visual elements are familiar if you've seen other Anderson movies. (He must have a fantastic record collection, and I do mean vinyl records.) In ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" Anderson presents, mostly through the two young leads, the joy and agony of being an adolescent at odds with society and authority, and totally in love for the first time. Both awkward and confident at the same time, Sam and Suzy are unhappy at home for various reasons, and struggle to make friends, but after a chance meeting, forge a bond through letters. (It's set in the 1960s and makes you wish we'd all write letters to each other again.) ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is full of big-name stars having a grand time in their roles, with plenty of action, wicked satire and whip-quick dialogue, as well as a beautiful New England island setting. There are also some excellent young actors in the roles of Sam's fellow boy scouts, a subversive crew of fun-loving smart-alecks. But the two lead actors are the film's prize: fresh, unaffected, shy and restrained at times, and passionate. Suspend your cynicism and just enjoy ""Moonrise Kingdom.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

life is worthless without childish dream and innocence.,"If you say that men and women cannot understand each other, fair enough, i have never been a woman, i have never had a period. how on earth am i supposed to know right?(>.>)but if you say that adults cannot understand kids, this is outrageous at best.my name is from Lyra and Will, if u read his dark materials you will know, I am a child supremacist. Everything in the movies that describes naiveness of children are true, except for the fact that they assume that children's are the weak minority.Children's are not weak minorities, as much as I am not banned to write what I think after I watched one of the best movie I have watched on boy and girl affection and its social and spiritual context.Adults should not lose their children's heart either. I am 20, so what?After the movie at Marquee, I climbed the wall on the side to the patio where I walked my bike in, I assume that the people waiting in line to get out from the main exits must think I am childish, hopefully in a good way or they sat here 2 hours watching this movie for nothing.When I enter the Marquee, there was only one girl from WUD film outside in charge, she was going to stamp me but then she didn't eventually, she just smiled and held the door for me. I was waiting for her to say bikes aren't allowed, but guess what, she did not even stare at my bike, all she did was implying me that she appreciate that I come for a good movie. And isn't it good? I barely read any review, I only read about Wes Anderson and stuff.We all have a rebel in us. Rebellious makes us creative, free, and organically naturally beautiful.I hope with all my soul that you have your own haven of heart.

"Wes Anderson's quirky coming-of-age adventure is whimsical, delightful, and blisters with eccentric charm","One thing viewers can walk away with when sitting through Moonrise Kingdom is that Wes Anderson has a gift for storytelling and style without resorting to conventionality. This coming-of-age adventure blending in both comedy and drama is a whimsical journey Anderson's signature style with a brimming sense of substance many, if not all, teens and adults can come to admire. Of course, Anderson does not take a leap deep into reality. Instead, it presents a roster of eccentric characters and quirky situations to tell a story of two children who vow to escape their domestic home lives where they are misunderstood pawns of families who intentionally (and unintentionally) torment their everyday lives. As this is a Wes Anderson picture though, it breathes plenty of idiosyncratic humor in the air that allows viewers to connect with the story while engaging in Anderson's unique style of smarts, humor, and unconventional narrative norms. The film, set in the 1960s New England, follows Sam Shakusky (played by Jared Gillman), a 12- year old boy attending a boys scout under the wing of Scoutmaster Randy Ward (played by Edward Norton) while forced to deal with the torment of his mean-spirited scoutmates; and Suzy Bishop (played by Kara Hayward), a quiet girl of the same age living with her parents (played by Frances McDormand and Bill Murray) and her little brothers who she despises. Determined to escape their home lives, the two venture out into the woods and where they begin to bond and eventually form a romantic relationship. Their absence soon alert the both the boys scout and Suzy's family as they set out along with the town's police Captain Sharp (played by Bruce Willis) to look for them, turning the town into a wild topsy-turvy.The movie has all of the right feel of a Wes Anderson, from the flat space camera movement, to the limited color palette, to the quirky dialogue. And for the most important part, it works as an eccentric piece of comedic fare. Anderson delivers the goods with his signature quirky dark humor and unconventional characters that feel like more than just two-dimensional figures dwindling beneath his signature methodology. The central core of the story is two preteen children who form a seemingly inseparable bond through their opening in each other's broken lives. Sam is a lonely boy who's parents are dead and is forced to deal with the maltreatment of his fellow peers, while Suzy is a cynical young girl who can't seem to find the love of her family. As the two fall in love, there a subtle chemistry is developed in not meant to convey a sense of charm, but a symbol of freedom. While the sensuality between the two may leave some conservative viewers in slight discomfort, especially when observing them dancing in their underwear, it is the maturity that triumphs over edginess. And kudos to go to both Jared Gillman and Kara Hayward for their mature performances. When the story periodically shifts its focus on the families and the authorities out in search for them, everything remains just as tasteful, but with a quirkier edge. There, we witness a plethora of screwball performances by Edward Norton, Wes Anderson veteran Bill Murray, and the unusually eccentric Bruce Willis in roles that more often than not resemble caricatures. Of course, Anderson is known for his cartoony style, and that is what his films bravely unique. And while they are certainly not the kind of performances that will leave people talking for a while, they deserve to be admired.Moonrise Kingdom marks a delightful cinematic achievement by Wes Anderson who opens the gates to a whimsical, elegant adventure of freedom and coming to terms with a disillusioned home life. Although I can say it necessarily strikes cinematic gold, which would be saying a lot otherwise, it is a film that a substance and heart that demands to be observed.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wes Anderson's mind must be an exciting place for a story idea to be born,"Wes Anderson's mind must be an exciting place for a story idea to be born. It immediately becomes more than a series of events and is transformed into a world with its own rules, in which everything is driven by emotions and desires as convincing as they are magical. ""Moonrise Kingdom"" creates such a world and takes place on an island that might as well be ruled by Prospero. It's set in 1965, though it might as well be set at any time. On this island no one seems to live except for those involved in the story. There is a lighthouse in which the heroine, Suzy, lives with her family, and a Scout camp where the hero, Sam, stirs restlessly under what seem to him childish restrictions. Sam and Suzy met the previous summer and have been pen pals ever since, plotting a sort of jailbreak from their lives during which they could have an adventure out from under the thumbs of adults, if only for a week. Sam (Jared Gilman) is an orphan, solemn behind oversized eyeglasses, an expert in scouting. Suzy (Kara Hayward) is bookish, a dreamer. When they have their long-planned secret rendezvous in a meadow on the island, Sam is burdened with all the camping and survival gear they will possibly need, and Suzy has provided for herself some books to read, her kitten and a portable 45 rpm record player with extra batteries. Because this is a Wes Anderson film, you know Bill Murray will appear in it. He has worked in the last five of Anderson's six films. In ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" he plays Walt Bishop, Suzy's father, and Frances McDormand is her mother. Murray is always right for a role in an Anderson film, and I wonder if it's because they share a bemused sadness. You can't easily imagine Murray playing a manic or a cut-up; his eyes, which have always been old eyes, look upon the world and waver between concern and disappointment. In Anderson's films, there is a sort of resignation to the underlying melancholy of the world; he is the only American director I can think of whose work reflects the Japanese concept mono no aware, which describes a wistfulness about the transience of things. Even Sam and Suzy, sharing the experience of a lifetime, seem aware that this will be their last summer for such an adventure. Next year they will be too old for such irresponsibility.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

It tells an endearing story but in a very creative and stylistic way, only this imaginative storytelling will be liked or disliked depending solely on the viewer. If I had to define this movie in three words it'd be: innocent, awkward and odd (and maybe bold). It has a very unique sense of humor that to some would shock or make them feel uneasy at first but which will get better through rewatchings. And trust me, this movie needs a second and even third viewing.I actually stumbled upon this movie while I was searching for coming of age movies and ranking lists kept bringing me to it. So when I decided to finally watch it I did not expect how uncomfortable but yet pleased it made me feel at the same time. Because that's what the average viewer, uninterested or unaware of the filmmaking behind a film, will feel towards it. It's so pure and inspired that it's shocking to feel identified with so many of the things the kids are going through. This is one of the reasons I love coming of age movies, because the maturity the kids go through are so well captured that you feel what they are going through too. It indeed tells a story of coming of age through the two lead characters in the most daring way (to an extent of having parents complain at how ""kiddie pornographic"" it can be at certain moments) but it does so wrapped in shots, narrative and aesthetic choices of the most uncommon.And because of this very unique style of storytelling and filmmaking, I was tempted to stop watching after the first 15 minutes. But I kept watching because the story really begins at that mark. I have no problem with artistic editing choices if done well like in this movie. At all moments I was aware of the timeline of the events and these choices actually felt refreshing and unique. But I hadn't had read the synopsis beforehand and that was a BIG mistake. If you go watch this movie with no idea of what the driving plot is just the notion that is about coming of age and about a boy and a girl that fall in love you are gonna have a hard time keeping up with what is going on.Nevertheless, I had zero to no interest in the side characters. What was going on with the two main kids was so intense that the other subplots that were going on were of no interest to me. Although this might have been enhanced by the lifeless dull tone of the line deliveries some of the adult characters had, especially Bruce Willis and Bill Murray. Up to a point of feeling miscasted given the absurdity of the humor and storytelling technique in the movie. I understand this was a stylistic choice, to channel humor through ""kids that talk like adults"" and somehow hyperbolic line delivery gimmick but it works, imo, only for the kids. The adults are found unenergetic and unengaging, as if they didn't convey the stress or worryness some scenes needed them to convey.However, some comedic choices in some scenes are very ""out of tone"" with the sort of reality the story is taking place in. The choice of treating dramatic and natural disasters feel comically irrelevant makes you wonder why they were used in the first place. I get it, this movie is not trying to tell this story in a conventional way but some storytelling decisions are made simply for comedic purposes. Also due to the style of this movie, as it is trying to tell a coming of age movie drawing from many fictional and fantastic symbolism from books and so on (like A Bridge to Therabitia but in a much much smaller scale) some moments pull you out of the realism the world the story is taking place in is meant to supposedly have. And that's another of the issues of this movie.I've been told on again that this is a comedy movie also, that the voices of the characters are meant to be witty and quirky and provide humour to many reactions. I personally have come to laugh or better chuckle at some of these reactions but most of the times it didn't quite land for me and I felt uneasy and awkward. But like I said, I wasn't used to Wes Anderson's style and therefore his humor either and as you rewatch the movie it grows on you.Hopefully with this review I didn't spoil too much and shed some light at the very creative and stylistic decisions made in the filmmaking and storytelling of this particular movie. I praise its originality and daring unconventionalism, I doubt the filmmaking decisions and some storytelling choices (attributing them to my lack of awareness of Wes Anderson's filmmaking style); and I applaud the coming of age tale. I believe in some way this story would have just been another of the bunch of its genre had it not been for its very unique style. It has something hypnotically endearing that hits close to home, very hard. Especially in the coming of age aspects of the story, there's an endearing attraction to the dialog of both lead characters as they get to discover themselves in their lonely adventure. The story is so good I'm sure I would have liked it if it were more conventional all the same.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rarefied elegance,"In Moonrise Kingdom, two kids on a remote New England island, from disparate backgrounds, decide to make a break for it, running away from their parents and Boy Scout troop, respectively. Wes Anderson's quirky, stylish romantic comedy-drama is pleasant, with all the usual off-beat trappings. It is both tender and amusing and infinitely relatable for anyone who remembers being a preteen and wishing to escape.In 1965, Jared Gilman plays Sam, a Scout member. He's disliked by the other boys, probably because of his over-sized glasses and overactive intellect. His scoutmaster is played by the redoubtable Edward Norton. One morning, when Sam does not show up for the camp's breakfast, Scoutmaster Ward discovers that the boy has left in the middle of the night. He calls in Captain Sharp (Bruce Willis), who canvasses the island and informs the Bishops (Bill Murray and Frances McDormand), just in case they see the boy. And soon thereafter, wouldn't you know it, but their rebellious daughter Suzy (Kara Hayward), is also missing. And so a manhunt is afoot.The most delightful aspect of this movie is that it, like Stand by Me before it, feels as if it's viewed directly through the perspective of young kids. Some adults are nice, some are not. Other kids can be mean. You can count on yourself and few others. Both Suzy and Sam come from unorthodox homes with some measure of regiment, and through the power of being pen pals, decide on a complex plan of action.But this isn't just a movie about two kids on the lam. It's about people discovering themselves, allowing themselves to be reborn as better scoutmasters, better parents, better cops. It's about young love's slow blossoming. It is not about physical intimacy. It's a genuine, honest, and deeply enchanting, colored in luxuriant blues and yellows and earth tones, peppered with the staccato speech of a scoutmaster and the angst of a police officer, and drenched in some terrific character acting. Hayward and Gilman are better than you would expect from neophytes; much, much better. Their pain, their loss, their love, their gain, their everything - we feel it all right there with them.It helps that Anderson has assembled a top-notch cast, even if none of them really get a lot of screen time. Willis, McDormand, and an almost- unrecognizable Harvey Keitel are all standouts. The story moves lightning quick, pausing only to show us tender moments in stark contrast to the mad dash to find the fleeing duo. It's a given that we're to root for the kids, but the adults are by no means presented as evil-doers who wish to punish their offspring. This is a movie that teaches us by allowing us to relive our own childhoods and see the choices laid out before us. And, like any kind-hearted movie, it shows us that love is a shining thing.Although I enjoyed Anderson's whimsical atmosphere set against some fairly serious backgrounds, including children in danger and even blood, I liked this movie first and foremost because of the dead-on performances of Gilman and Hayward, two stars in the making. Their chemistry is palpable; they are simultaneously a mismatched couple and two meant to be together.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Style and cleverness but little substance,"This movie was a waste of talented actors, who apparently were forced to deliver their lines like zombies in order to carry out some stylistic purpose in the mind of director Wes Anderson. The movie is so stylized that it is hard to discern any human feeling. Even the two youngsters whose romance is at the heart of the story are almost robotic in expressing themselves to each other.To me it's the kind of movie whose chief pleasure is for those who like to think they are clever enough to ""get"" what the director is trying to say.Just about the only actor who seemed to think and feel more or less like a real human being was Bruce Willis. As for Bill Murray and Frances Macdormand, their conversation in the bedroom, carried on while both like flat on their back staring at the ceiling, reminded me of two, well, zombies. Edward Norton had some funny bits, though his character was such a caricature of a scoutmaster that at best all I could manage was a few chuckles.Didn't like this movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Depicting the child,"I cannot begin without addressing Wes Anderson's genius direction style, which is flawless when applied to this genre. Anderson's rich storytelling despite years of absence from his first-hand experience renders the story all the more raw and natural. Childhood innocence and disillusionment is captured beautifully, both visually and through character dialogue. The brightness and saturation of colour in this film reflect the nostalgic nature of its content; a unique story of adventure and escapism.The exchanges between the two main young (and relatively unknown) actors are brilliant portrayals of our young years and the human adolescence experience. Tender scenes of young intimacy are taken seriously and are pulled together by the hardship we see the characters facing in order to fulfil their goal, which is to be together and away from 'home'.No unnecessary character development was seen in the adult characters in order to serve their fame and popularity, and this all the more supplements the artistry Anderson has created. Edward Norton's empathetical performance was notably outstanding, needless to say that each and every actor en scene portrayed their character almost faultlessly.A creation of beautiful composition being allowed to tell its story with compassion and self-awareness; a magnificent thing to be able to witness unravel before you. This is one of those experiences. The story arch culminates with a more action-based sequence involving many members of the all-star adult cast. This drove the film away from its rootings, yet added a more expressive tone to the ending.Moonrise Kingdom successfully illustrates the experience of two youngsters in an exploration of themselves and the world around them. In terms of style, with Anderson's use of subtle black humour mixed in the tangling complexities the child, could I possible not vote a 10/10 for this film?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I am not sure anyone is still capable of recognizing a masterpiece,"Even you with 7s and 8s. What exact beef or underperformance issue you see there? It is perfect in ever possible way!

"""Awfull"" doesn't begin to describe ""Mr. Anderson's"" junk movies","I am sorry but I really do not understand how people like this line of work,I really don't! Maybe someone can enlighten me by explaining how come I do not understand this! Reading other peoples reviews I found out that most of the reviewers love Wes Anderson's work but nobody says whats to like! Most of what Wes Anderson is making (The Darjeeling Limited, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou, The Royal Tenenbaums, just to name a few) is absolute junk, in all above mentioned movies the pace is slow, Characters are stupid and dumb and unresponsive to their surroundings and dialogues are incomplete and messed up as if the person delivering the lines is suffering from depression or another form of mental sickness, the colors are always dull, plot is numb and there are no sub plots or if there are he manages to conceal the sub plots so good that nobody can find them.Anyways, if you need a film to play in the background so that you can comfortably sleep on your couch for an hour or two before going to bed (which is really enjoyable and sublime activity and much preferred to watching Wes's movies) then it's OK, otherwise if you look for a way to spend your time wisely and want to enjoy your precious time, look for something else, anything but Wes Andersons work, if you wanna know about his movies nothing can explain them better than looking at his picture( http://www.imdb.com/media/rm268013312/nm0027572 ), then you'll understand what I mean.I mean majority of movie goers are simple people like me, they want to see some action, some real life drama, real romance or just normal good old comedy à la Hot Shots or Big Stan, we don't want to solve riddles or think very hard to see if we understand what the plot of the movie is or if we understand the characters psychology.CONCLUSION : Give me a simple plot with some action, romance and/or drama, and use some good old actors that can deliver their part and excite me and make me enjoy my time and I'll give you an 8 or 9 or maybe even 10, disappoint me and make me feel bad about the money and time that I spent watching your crap of a movie and you'll have to do with 1 or 2 and maybe if you'r lucky you get a 3 from me, MAYBE.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"crisp, clean, well-staged, acted and written.","the gift that Wes Anderson gives us is the gift of making it seem as if every single moment of living for his characters is leading up to something huge, as much as they like to remain neutral.never a dull moment in the script. a master of the staging of each frame, this movie feels like a play. so sharp that the comedy is situational and rare.bill murray creates someone that we all want to be, but simply cant. bruce willis - welcome back to acting. and hello hair. the two kids are so unique and mature.Wes Anderson, well done. and roman c.i'd give it a 10, but i'm too egotistical. 9.5",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Moonrise Kingdom,"My fourth Wes Anderson film, a 2D cinema-going, the previous three are THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (2001, a 7/10), THE LIFE AQUATIC WITH STEVE ZISSOU (2004, an 8/10) and THE DARJEELING LIMITED (2007, a 6/10).With its burgeoning domestic box-office performance (a $38.8M by last week, only second to THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, which cashed in around 52M in the whole run), MOONRISE KINGDOM has a chance to be elevated into the weighty consideration as the BEST PICTURE contender in the Oscar race for the first time for Mr. Anderson, and a more potent edge is that it has gathered his idiosyncratic innovative creativity and incubates it with a fairly engaging story, therefore it can be conceived as his most developed and fully grown work to date.Apart from Anderson's regular troupe (Murray and Schwartzman), newcomers here are copious with Hollywood renowned names, Willis, Norton, McDormand, Swinton, Keitel and Balaban. But they are merely screen foils, the film revolves around a teenager duo, Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, as the premature elopers. The storyline is nothing particularly extraordinary, it is Anderson's paradigmatic trump cards, the simplistic design, colorful costumes plus a generally reddish palette, the distinctive horizon-and-vertical moving shots cum a fast-paced editing, the unorthodox charisma of its characters (a poke-faced Kara is an inward-distraught rebel while a nerd-looking Jared is a boldly underage adventurer), all above are propelling the film as the slipstream through its cerebrally entertaining and visually bombarding ride with prudence and detailed quirkiness.In the film, the adult characters are mainly sidelined and mockingly immature, juxtaposed with our young-but-steady runaways, the disparity could not be more overt. But the film is more than a modern fairytale, its sleek and trendy predisposition has an innate crowd-pleasing trait, especially at this time, all the fantasies and puppy love stories have been marred by violence (the ubiquitous bullies) and darkness (Tim Burton needs to burn more cash and vampires need love too since undead is boring), Anderson's children-like temperament may find a fertile soil to bloom, arguable, killing a doggie and struck by thunder are appropriate to the pre-teen audience, but what the hell anyway, his territory is always open to adults who linger with a ingenuous heart.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Magical,"Do kids have fun any more? Can they have fun with all the technology they seem to have in hand all the time? Or am I just being a fogey, because it isn't the kind of fun I had when I was a kid? :) Maybe so. This film captures the essence of play, of childhood, of the wonky, imperfect, childish response to serious situations. It captures the magical essence of times and settings that would become wonderfully fond memories, though I didn't know it then. It evokes a kind of forgiveness and fondness for the child I was then. That's a lot for one movie to accomplish! I read a 10/10 review by emilson-117, May 2012 . A much more articulate review than mine, which gets it in a nutshell.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Gorgeous and Brilliant,"This is my first review on IMDb and also my first viewing of a Wes Anderson film so, you may take my review lightly. This movie was extremely enjoyable. Any who know Anderson's films, know that his cinematography is beautiful and definitely adds to the appeal of Moonrise Kingdom. I have seen the actress in this film who plays Suzie and I absolutely love her as an actress. This is a great coming of age film and accurately depicts the awkwardness of childhood relationships. If you wish to see a film that is beautifully crafted and has perfect acting, this film is for you. I look forward to watching other Anderson films but it may be hard to top this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The movie is extremely boring, homemade looking and has a childish nonsense story line... and did I already said BROING has hell?I don't understand how an actor like Edward Norton could accept to participate in such amateur crap movie like this. Also amazes me how some people were able to watch the movie till the end without feel a sleep.

you need an odd sense of humor,"This brilliant movie about a pre-teen boy and girl that fall in love and run away, leaving the people of the bourgeois island in hysteric panic (after they noticed the kids were gone and started to care), requires an odd sense of humor. If you do not have that, if you're as bourgeois as the islanders, it will be wasted on you. Otherwise you will be in for an amazing treat, full of absurd situations, relations, households, events and dialogues. And with people desperately trying to cope with their lives,in contrast with the young love of two outcasts.The whole movie from begin to end gets you of your feet, it is all close to normal, but just not that. The tree-house on the top of a thin stripped tree (commented as: ""isn't that dangerous?"") represents the whole atmosphere of the movie.Highly recommended",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another enjoyable Wes Anderson watch,"After watching and loving 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' I thought I'd look into more films by Wes Anderson and came across this one.Again, I seem to just love the way he makes movies and Moonrise Kingdom is another great film.

An amazing fairy tale!,"A long time ago, I watched this movie right after the Grand Budapest Hotel

An amazing fairy tale that raises topics close to both children and adults. It turns out to be an exemplary family movie.If you are not familiar with the director's filmography, then it is better to start with something else, because then you will want more, and the rest of the work, not counting cartoons and the above-mentioned Hotel, is inferior in quality.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fantastic Cinema Art,"I love this movie. So cleverly made and written so well. It seems so difficult to get kids to act their parts well but it was done here. The camera angles and scene selections are great. So many interesting details happening in the background. It is definitely quirky and will go down as a movie similar to Nacho Libre, but with much more cinematic art in the mix. A must see, particularly for movie buffs interested in seeing how the little details in a movie add up to equal greatness. I can certainly see this being used as an example in film class. But don't shy away from it if you aren't into that part.....it is a well made movie and just plain enjoyable to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wes Anderson is a fantastic director,"I absolutely adore this film, and I am really starting to come around to Wes Anderson films. This is a film that I would recommend to anyone, from general audiences, to those who appreciate the craft behind film making. Wes Anderson is an absolute master of framing and setting up perfectly symmetrical shots, and this film really shows his technical capabilities. The story is fun, doesn't take itself too seriously and is told in almost a fairytale kind of fashion, but doesn't take the liberties that a usual fairytale would take (except maybe one part at the end, but I think it's earned considering everything else that was done so flawlessly in the film).When you take a great story like Beauty and the Beast and turn it into a bad live adaptation, the creative liberties you had when it was a cartoon DO NOT translate well to live action. This film knows this and chooses not to do anything that's too ridiculous or requires too much suspension of disbelief.It's also great to see good child actors, as well as knowing how to direct groups of people that behave and move in realistic ways and aren't just standing around being extras. Although I wasn't a big fan of Fantastic Mr Fox, I did thoroughly enjoy Grand Budapest Hotel (which I intend on rewatching at some point) and Isle of Dogs.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quintessential Wes Anderson,"If you are a fan of Wes Anderson you'll love the delightfully quirky story of Moonrise Kingdom.It is full of eccentric characters, and razor sharp script, offbeat humour, and as always with Wes, a terrific cast.The directorial trademarks are all there too.Another fantastic film from Wes Anderson!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really sweet and shot splendidly,"Moonrise Kingdom is a movie that is pleasant both visually and story-wise. I'm a big fan of coming-of-age stories and they're sort of a guilty pleasure at this point and this movie, so this movie was just up my alley. Jared Gilman, who played Sam here, reminded me of Teddy Duchamp from Stand By Me (1986) for some reason, mostly from his looks and I kind of imagined him being the modern version of Teddy, it's just a thought I had that I kept through the whole runtime. Even though these movies are more than 25 years apart and touched on completely different prospects, they both achieved in making me feel like I missed out on a lot when I was a pre-teen. Kind of making me wish I had experiences like these to share but then again, they also give me some ground for the imagination of what could have been.One thing I appreciate is that the cinematography is simple but it is used in a way to capture everything in just the right way and from just the right angle. The majority of the movie is filmed in still shots that either move to the x, y, or z-axis respectfully and sometimes rotate around the circumference. I didn't notice a lot of moving shots where the camera catches the actor and moves in respect to him, it's rather the camera catches the atmosphere and actors fill it up. I'm not a film major and I don't know exactly what this entails but this method of filming made me feel that the surrounding played as big of a role as the actors. Seeing the shots tilt from left to right or being zoomed in or zoomed out in a still shot gave a lot of perspectives and was either to follow and it made me feel at peace. Getting a 90 degree, or even more during some cases, somehow makes it feel more natural, you almost forget that it may be shot at a set and I really enjoy watching a film, whose director made the decisions to film it that way. I don't believe I've ever seen a movie shat like that to this extent and an effect as great as this, at least I don't recollect one that could be compared to this one.I can't shake off the good vibes that this feeling gave to me and I'm happy that this movie found me at a time like this. Seeing as this was directed by Wes Anderson, I can proudly say that I enjoyed his work and I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wes Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom continues his off-kilter sense of drama,"The only other Wes Anderson movie I ever saw was The Royal Tennenbaums which I remember being quite amusing with the way it often took its time just meandering at points before going to wherever it was going to. So it is here as we meet a couple of unusual teens named Sam (Jared Gilman) and Suzy (Kara Hayward). They both run away to a forest from various troubles with either bullies or parents or authorities. Nice adult turns by the likes of Edward Norton, Bruce Willis, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Bob Balaban, and Anderson veteran Bill Murray. Like I said, you may be amused by some of the weird goings on throughout but you may also appreciate the quaint way things go concerning plot and characterization.

My Pre-Pubescent Ex-Girlfriend,"What do I loathe about the world?—the fact that its genesis is compared to everything else generated by human mind, like the world is not an artificial product itself, huh? I think, and I know that I'm by no means an authority on this matter, that the archetypal form of perfection itself is imagination, and it's the closest to the framework of existentialism that we now call reality. I mean whoever produced the ""reality"" we see today must have imagined it with his ""imagination"" at some point.Anderson has been very aberrant with all his works. Just when everybody thought Anderson can't think of anything but Tenenbaums in his every other movie, he delivered The Grand Budapest Hotel that boasts off the cognitive versatility that man possesses. For Moonrise Kingdom, I think people have been criticizing it for its similarity to Anderson's previous moves, except Fantastic Mr. Fox, in the production proceedings. I have to slightly agree with this claim, but I'd phrase more like, ""Anderson has his own way of seeing things."" Moonrise Kingdom doesn't really fit into any genre that prevails on the planet. It's not drama for me, except for the nostalgia—like remembering my ex-girlfriend whom I met before you grew them, if you know what I mean. With all the silly things that this movie shows, I still believe that this movie is not for anybody under 15; they can watch it, sure, but for the proper comprehension of its record player, latrine, binoculars, pebbles, Edward Norton (all of him), Captain Sharp & Social Services, raven, and literally so many things.From this, I would like to make a point: While Anderson adopts the same strategy of reflecting things from his perspective and view of the cinema and the world, he shows his perspective in so many different ways and with so many symbolizations that his emblem doesn't really remain static. I mean I wouldn't take Moonrise Kingdom to be either of drama, comedy, or adventure. It was exploratory, but that exploration had nothing to do with camping, lighting fires, and so on; it had more to do with exploring yourself, your childish predilections, and eventually learning the mature out of that. We all must know this if we've ever experienced infatuation(s) in the very early phase of our life. Everybody thinks the ideal way, where the quest for being sardonic is trashed away for a while and the idealized view of the ""self"" and the ""generalized"" is presented for eternal edification. This, just this, even accounts for the nourishment and sustenance of conscience. I know this has all turned philosophical but see, that's the groundwork Anderson wished to induce. Anderson knows that all minds don't sync in uniformity, and he's not trying to invert that. He's only giving you something that sis completely awry of the trend. Why keep everything close to how it happens in the real world? Why not invent something, be ahead of everyone else and called a fool, but then get praised for being one of the finest film-makers of all-time? I'd totally go for that route.Anderson is one of the very few film-makers alive who really aim for novelty. Even among those handful, Anderson's scripts, and directorial endeavors are by far the most distinguishable, and this really qualifies him as a film-maker. I'm really not kidding by saying that naming the chef in a single bite is nearly impossible. So when they say that glitter is to Anderson as everything-else is to Hollywood (I'm sorry I just made that up), they're truly saying something.Please don't think of the man as obsessed with pre-pubescent kids; he's just trying to make a point. And he's so good with that than even after audiences like me know that this is all melodramatic, and miles away from pure sentimentalism, they cannot get rid of getting emotional about it.I can't speak for anyone else, but I've loved him since always, and he continues to surprise me with everything he brings on.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lovely,"Completely and utterly Wes Anderson movie, which means highly recognizable visual style, quirky characters and a universe of its own. With time they will be remembered as influential and classics, now being current they are criticized for being outside of the box. I can't help but seeing ""Amelie"" in all of this, but this is my problem and it doesn't really take away from the fact that Anderson's work is highly enjoyable.""Moonrise Kingdom"" is a good, old-fashioned children's movie with some dark undertones (loss of innocence) focused on modern-day Romeo and Juliet who found each other as a comfort from outside world. But where everybody finds literary characters completely acceptable, here it brings all kinds of of reactions with viewers that actually sound very philistine to me, as ""originals"" were not much older. If I remember correctly, Juliet was around 14 so there you go. These kids are lonely outsiders and whatever intimacy they share, its a dreamy world full of books, music and camp fire. And earrings made from fish hooks.Watching this, I couldn't help but wondering has every child at least once thinking about running away from home - my little gang had extremely detailed plans about our collective escape, though f course it sounds so silly now to remember how one girl wanted to take her plastic bath tub with us in case of the rain (this gives you idea how small she must have been). Lots of grown-up actors here but they don't really matter and perhaps its a waste of big names since all the attention is on kids anyway. Again, I just love all the visual effects here and no matter how artificial, silly or cartoonish they might be, its beautiful, particularly that little isolated bay with one tent. Its a dream.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
It Gives me Nostalgia for things I've Never Experienced,"This film feels incredibly nostalgic to me even though it's set during a period where I wasn't alive and in an area I have never visited with scenarios I have never experienced. The way this film feels nostalgic though is that it captures the childhood dream, escaping adults with someone you love and going on adventures together in the wild. It captures the whimsy and innocence of childhood and pairs it with an interesting and funny story that never gets stale.The cast is great, especially the two children played by Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward, managing to hold their own surprisingly well when playing against veterans of the industry like Bruce Willis, Tilda Swinton or Edward Norton. As with any Wes Anderson film the cinematography is great, the production design is fantastic and the use of miniatures is phenomenal, it's great seeing the way Wes Anderson avoids having to use CGI in this film, however, there are a couple of cases where CGI is used and it is not good, looking more like something you would see in a YouTube video than a feature film. Still, visually, on the whole this is great. Apart from a couple of shoddy effects that are very brief this film doesn't really have any problems, if you like Wes Anderson you'll love it but I'm willing to bet that even if you aren't a fan of his you'll still get something out of this film. A strong 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful piece of art,"I love Wes Anderson's style, but Moonrise Kingdom made me cry. And it didn't make me cry because the story is sad. It is just a beautifully written story, with very peculiar characters in a very peculiar world. I find it inspirational, exciting and so well done. As always, Anderson uses visual effects in a very smart and artistic way. His stories don't need photorealistic explosions or convoluted scenes full of dust, smoke and debris flying all over the place. Instead, Anderson surprises with his beautifully crafted stories and uses visual effects to allow imagination translate into film. Moonrise Kingdom is comedy, drama, action and adventure ... All in one. There's no point on briefing someone on this story. The whole piece needs to be appreciated and enjoyed as a whole. Graphic design, music, painting, writing, photography, acting—so many forms of art were involved in this movie that I can just feel excited and hopeful about having the chance to make part of something similar in the near future.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unusual mix of citations,"First credits go to the stellar cast, with a particularly clever performance by young Jared Gilman. A sort of Romeo and Juliet story set in the mid-1960's, of young, impulsive lovers resisting the conventions of their respective families. Those of us who were their contemporaries at the time will recognize the familiar Little Rascals-Addams Family vs. Hitler Youth conflicts.

Thoughts on Moonrise Kingdom,"Moonrise Kingdom is a beautiful, highly stylized film in typical Wes Anderson fashion, oozing with personality. Every shot is purposeful and there are tons of creative presentation choices that turn what could have been a boring standard shot into something vastly more impactful. For instance, the close up of an arrow cutting through the air and the flashy frame of the left scissors to convey a whole action scene. What could have been just a simple overhead reveal shot of Captain Sharp dangling from the church roof holding the children is instead shown from a pulled back wide angle using silhouettes. Although present throughout the film the church roof scene also has great composition with four characters crammed together in the window, peering out in anticipation.Moonrise Kingdom is filled with great characters that are largely acted off kilter and deadpan which I found really intriguing and a joy to watch. The film is about something that I'm sure is very familiar and melancholy to most of us, a young first love. However west Anderson's version is highly fanciful.Wes finds a way to combine his imaginative, ridiculous visual aesthetic with the real world and the results are wonderful.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Alexandre Desplat dis the music.,"Wes Anderson directed and wrote with Ronan Coppola. The production of Gerald Sullivan, Adam Stockhausen, and Kris Moran stands separate from the script. The script would not work without the production's dominant presence. The cinematography and the color palette of greens and blue also dominate the script. The characters don't dominate this film but are there to show the artistry of the production. The characters exist in a fairy tale world of the production. Things happen but nothing is permanent. The music and the artistic production present a fleeting glimpse at a moment which all agree will not be repeated.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
To Date Anderson's Best,"What a marvelous little gem of a movie. Or should I say ""candy box"" of a movie - an item that Anderson's precise, beautifully detailed, prettily decorated and quite often delicious productions often resemble. He is definitely one of the most original directors of all time. It's also a salute to his talents that he was able to coax wonderful performances from the two romantic leads - both making their debuts here. Everything about the film is perfection down to the last little detail. The cast is terrific with Murray getting most of the-laugh-out-loud lines, but everyone getting their moment to shine. This may well be the best movie about adolescent romance ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Murray does it again, finally","Have you ever looked at someone and, in an instant, felt a powerful connection to them? Something that made you want to abandon your life and run away with them? Not me, but the same can't be said for two teens at the center of the latest comedy from the mind of Wes Anderson.It's 1965 and, on a small, picturesque island in New England, there are two very unhappy children. One of them, Sam Shakusky (played by Jared Gilman), is an orphan visiting Camp Ivanhoe with his troop of wilderness-oriented Khaki Scouts. The other, Suzy Bishop (played by Kara Hayward), lives on the island with her parents, Walt and Laura (played by veteran actors Bill Murray and Frances McDormand) and three younger brothers. Walt and Laura (Murray and McDormand) are both attorneys who are struggling to maintain both their personal and their professional relationship. One year before the beginning of our story, Sam and Suzy meet backstage during a play which Sam is attending and Suzy is acting in. Despite the brevity of that encounter, the two find themselves inexorably drawn to each other and exchange letters during their separation. They vow to run away together the next summer. We fast- forward to '65 and Sam has vanished from Camp Ivanhoe and done it without alerting his scout master, Randy Ward (played by Edward Norton) or any of his fellow scouts. The search is well underway before the Sheriff, Captain Sharp (played by Bruce Willis) is made aware of the fact that Suzy has vanished as well. When the young lovers meet again, Sam has brought a multitude of camping necessities while Suzy brought books, her cat, records and a record player. They hike and camp for days until finding a deserted cove and make camp, naming their new home Moonrise Kingdom.Obviously, there is more to the story. There's the revelation that two of the adult characters are involved in a clandestine relationship of their own, additional details of Sam's life story are revealed, and his eventual confrontation with his former scout troop who see it as their responsibility to bring Sam back using any means necessary, including lethal. All this culminates in a scene that had me on the edge of my seat. More than likely, this film, like some of director Wes Anderson's previous efforts, will fail to resonate with the viewing public. I, however, enjoyed it a great deal.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is Wes Anderson's masterpiece,"The only reason I rate this 10/10 is that the IMdB scale doesn't go any higher. I'd give it 11/10 if I could. This is pure movie magic.Before I forget to mention it, the end credits might be the best thing about this thoroughly great film -- Benjamin Britten's ""Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra"" plays while a child's voice narrates it and the credits go by in graceful, colorful script. Don't leave till you've seen every last bit. It's genius.But the movie itself -- I like Wes Anderson's work a lot but I'm still struggling with how to pin it down in words. It's eccentric charm -- absolutely every speaking role in the film is an eccentric persona -- but somehow more than that. Many or even most of the characters are fairly serious, straight-ahead personalities who don't see their own eccentricities, and when they collide with each other or with the real world is when the fun begins. That's especially true of the young preteens Suzy and Sam (newcomers Kara Hayward and Jared Gilman) around whom the plot revolves. The cast has lots of the Wes Anderson regulars like Edward Norton, Frances McDormand, Bill Murray, Bob Balaban, Tilda Swinton, and Bruce Willis in the bigger roles. Every one of them adds to the chaotic mix that the storyline becomes.Anderson's ""Grand Budapest Hotel"" (2014) followed Moonrise Kingdom a couple of years later and got more acclaim. It's great too but I don't agree. ""Hotel"" is thoroughly entertaining but it's SO stylish that it kind of outweighs the human beings underneath. Moonrise Kingdom has style and charm to burn, but it also keeps its human heart at the center. You end up feeling a sense of affection for each one of them. The characters are flawed human beings worth caring for, particularly Suzy and Sam who go off together to have an adventure that at least temporarily releases them from their confining environments. They're both mildly crazy, but as the old saying goes, they click because the rocks in his head somehow perfectly fit the holes in hers.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Beautiful,"One of my favourite films. The colours, the scenes, the way the camera moves around a group conversation. The music fits the emotion of whats on the screen. Acting is excellent, storyline is well done and I love the unique way the film is narrated. I love the opening sequence, moving around the house, being introduced to the key characters, allowing the colour and music to begin to invade your senses. The interaction with the narrator early on in the film, pointing out the disaster that is about to hit the small island, gives speed and a feeling of impending doom to our two adventurers. I don't usually enjoy 'arty' films that much, but this one has a certain aspect to it that I can't put my finger on. The story come to a super ending when a number of different stories come together in a way that allows the viewer to appreciate the storyline for what it is.

Typically Wes Anderson from the first moment to the last,"The movies of Wes Anderson are often absurd and fairylike, in varying proportions.In ""Moonrise Kingdom"" absurdism predominates. It is about two kids (Sam played by Jared Gilman and Suzy played by Kara Hayward) that, so to speak, are playing mom and dad.I thought immediately about two somewhat older immatures also playing mom and dad in ""Badlands"" (1973, Terrence Malick), but that film is much more violent and much more grim.The film is not only about kids trying to act mature, but also about grown ups who like being kids again. See for example Edward Norton as scout master Ward.Talking about the supporting roles, these are impressively filled in with stars like Bruce Willis, Bill Murray, Frances McDormand and Tilda Swinton.Apart from absurdism there is also a great deal of nostalgia. This is apparant from situating the story in a scouting camp but also in the use of colors (green and brown, typical of the 60's).The film is typically Wes Anderson from the first moment on. In the opening scene we learn how the different instruments of an orchestra together play a symphony. We also learn however that the different members of the Bishop household together does not form a family.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
thoughts on moonrise kingdom,"The only movie i had watched from Anderson before this was Fantastic Mr Fox when i was younger and had a baseline appreciation for Anderson's style but after watching Moonrise Kingdom I have gained a whole new appreciation and perspective on Anderson's unique style. Moonrise Kingdom definitely showcases Anderson's best qualities and will definitely get you into watching the rest of his movies.The story line was very well written, slightly confusing at first, but clears up after a while. Since Moonrise Kingdom's main characters a children it has a very nice childhood, nostalgic feel to it but in the best possible way. Seeing these adult situations through the eyes of children and since kids are unpredictable, Anderson did a great job of capturing this through dialouge and even music.If you are looking for a good Wes Anderson movie to start of your Wes Anderson obsession, Moonrise Kingdom does a great job of this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

My Favorite of Anderson's,"This is a story filled with tragedy. Orphan boy that no one likes, Alienated daughter, cheating wife, jealous and defeated husband. This kind of story could have been told in such a melodramatic way, but it wasn't. It's a quaint adventure, with quirky twists and turns, everything light and adventurous. That is why I love this film. Wes Anderson is so skilled at bottling up humanity and serving it back to us in carefully controlled, picturesque tales. This is my favorite film from Anderson, and I find myself drawn back to it, knowing I can both experience, and be protected from some of the hardships of humanity.Love is the underlying theme that enriches this story, and the love story of Sam and Suzy is a statement that sometimes love doesn't make sense. Sometimes it's absurd, sometimes forbidden. It draws characters together and pushes them apart. For all the film's tragedy, the humanity and kindness of all the characters keep it bright and accessible, as if we are being told a childhood story, tucked away in the safety and comfort of our beds.050323

Amazingly Quirky,"I loved the aesthetic of this film. The directing was amazing. But those two best parts of the film were also its worst. In some way, it was too good. Too good to be true. But it was realistic. There was something very wrong with this movie, though I can't put my finger on it.The characters had no depth to them, but that was expected from a film made for a preteen audience. It also looked like it was shot by a twelve year old, but that didn't bother me at all. Everything regarding this film wanted you to think ""twelve year olds"".The film left me a bit melancholic, never having experienced something like that. Surprisingly, this was Wes Anderson's first movie I ever watched, but that may be something very bad, my expectations for his other movies now being very high indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Beautiful, exciting, and an adrenaline rush","I heard great things of this film, but I went in with little expectations. But I was very happily surprised with the film. Let me start of with saying this is visually a gorgeous piece of film. Every frame is so original and beautiful you would only watch it again so you could admire the background. I can also confirm that this film contains loads of talented (young) actors. I loved the performance of Bruce Willis as Captain Sharp, Jarid Gilman as Sam and Kara Hayward as Suzy. The story itself is very basic and may appear nothing special. But in combination with the cinematography, acting, passing and music this is just a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish. At this point in time I've watched the film like 3 or 4 times (what's a lot for me). The more I watch it, the more excited I am about it.

A Unique Gem,"Moonrise Kingdom chronicles the life of two teenage lovers during the 1960s that flee their New England town, which causes the locals to search for them. The characters involve a marching scout sam, who has been outcasted by the rest of his troop, and an aggressive teenage girl named Suzy, who has shut herself off from the rest of her family. The characters are really what drive the focus of the film, and anyone who is a fan of light hearted and feel-good films should be able to enjoy the film, while also being able to embrace its distinctive dry, sarcastic humor.
The movie is influential to me on a personal level because it was the first film that I saw that made me realize that film can be much more than just entertainment, but it can also balance artistic integrity as well, as evident in the masterful presentation. The first time that my mother had put on the movie, I thought it was going to be very dull and uninteresting based on the plot synopsis, seeing as though I was only eleven at the time. But after watching the film, there was plenty of visual humor and colorful characters to keep my interest.
The cinematography is symmetrical and the editing is used to an almost striking effect that, in my case, mimics a classic storybook that lends itself to multiple viewings (Also, the books that Suzy stole from the library could also represent this idea). This style is also frequently used in Wes Anderson's other films, such as Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009), The Grand Budapest Hotel(2014), and, just recently, Isle of Dogs (2018). A lot of the characters behave in a almost monotone manner that makes the dialogue sound a little stilted and monotone at times, however, I believe that it lends itself to a more surrealistic take on more serious issues that the film tackles. The themes that Anderson focuses on are teenage adolescence and childhood and how it juxtaposes with the adult world and how the two perspectives contrast.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
High Score is misleading,"This is a kid's movie and not funny at all.

As stylish as it is pointless,"I was excited by the beginning of this film, which was quirky, funny, visually striking, and just plain weird. I was hoping that finally, Anderson had made a movie I would love as much as The Royal Tennenbaums.Alas, it didn't happen. The movie is endlessly stylish and quirky, but it never connects emotionally. The characters made me think of those in Hal Hartley movies, conversing obliquely, but while Hartley's films, at their best, allow misfits to connect in odd, sometimes touching ways, Anderson's characters are just odd for the sake of being odd, and the disconnected conversations feel like they're just weird for the sake of being weird rather than because Anderson has something to say about finding connections in a disconnected world. Because of this, I just didn't see the movie as having any point or purpose.There were good moments, and the stylish visuals and general odd tone kept me somewhat entertained, but I'd say this is yet another miss for Anderson, who I have lower expectations for with each movie he puts out.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

a breakthrough for cartoons.,"This film has got to be one of the best animated feature-length films ever.

The only way I can describe it is as a weird mishmash of adventure, drama, comedy and romance with a very weird and very shallow plot. One of the main problems I have with Anderson's films is how much emphasis is placed on style and visuals. It seems like more thought goes into the camera movements in his films than the actual plot.

Great cast gone bad.,"I still don't know exactly what to think of this movie. It is quite exceptional in the sense that the story telling won't suffer any kind of repression, where anything is possible within their own reality.

However, the whole experience may take its toll and the anxiety for an immediate break becomes a little hard to bear.""Moonrise Kingdom"" is weird and the wonderful cast looks like a reward for having your time and attention. It is technically not long, but it feels like forever. The start is very fresh, but once you dive into the film, every minute lingers on through long dialogues that, if not adequate, make the characters sound like they're all stoned. The story line, however, can be uplifting where the main two characters prove that happiness is something to conquer and not delivered by mail.

And similarly for drastic events (e.g, lightning strikes & floods that omitted realistic human consequences). -- (2) AND, certainly MORE damaging to me, a retired clinical psychologist: I've worked (therapy + consulting with authorities & families) with scores of foster kids who've been repetitively rejected by their latest set of foster parents and forced into another placement--as well as with many kids in dysfunctional families who were acting out.These are usually kids with IMMENSE amounts of hidden pain so viewing their behaviors and their behavioral consequences as canvases on which to paint comedy certainly doesn't hack it for me.

A movie well suited for the world,"I read a short story recently by Ernest Hemingway that I didn't want to like as I was reading it, even though technically speaking the story was good. I read another short story recently by Edgar Allen Poe that I wanted to like as I was reading it, even though the story was a failure. And the reason I was routing against the one, and for the other, had mostly to do with the attitude of the artist. And while Moonrise Kingdom has some significant things going for it (good scout location, strong visual cohesiveness), why did I want so badly to dislike the movie from start to finish? Well, because of the attitude behind the movie, which was pretentious. And since the world we live in is covered over with pretense it makes all the sense in the world that a filmmaker with such sensibilities would be backed to spend millions making something like this.Henry James wrote about Drama that the key is not to make something clever, or smart, or surprising, or shocking; the key in drama, he said, is to make it interesting. And to make it interesting it must be intense, while remaining emotionally honest.While the visuals in this movie were very impressive, and the locations beautiful, why did I feel so bored from start to finish? For better or worse, the soul of drama, as Aristotle put it, is plot. And the plot of this movie lacked interest to the extent that it lacked soul. A great irony of the picture is that one can tell very much that the the filmmarks prize their sense of intellect, good taste and cleverness. So how bewildering it was then that many lines felt like they were written by Beavis and Butthead posing as high brows.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

It is a dreadfully boring drama that aside form the usual visuals is entirely uninteresting.Then there is the infamous beach scene. I actually felt disgusted as I watched that scene. I have no idea what Anderson was aiming for his viewers to get out of that scene - in any case, I guess he succeeded if his objective was awkwardness and felling sick.The only people who will like this movie are die-hard fans of anderson who believe his **** doesn't stink and people who can't find it in themselves to honestly critique artsy indie films.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great moments do not a great film make,"I have been seeing as many independent, foreign, artsy, low-budget movies as I can in the past two months. While I laughed and had some emotional twinges, the film as a whole just doesn't get there. Yes, I am not a huge fan of this style of filmmaking. Halfway through any masterful components just seemed to fall apart. Ideas became stretched, plots got thin and/or predictable, and a few far-fetched/just unbelievable scenes took this movie down the drain. I love the members of the cast - so many incredible actors. They all do a fantastic job. In the end, the movie left me empty. Perhaps the Emperor has no clothes!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Massive disappointment,"I always tell myself not to watch the ratings any more, although when the scores are low, they tend to be correct. When you take in account a 7.8 rating combined with names like Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton or Bruce Willis one would expect a real outstanding and entertaining movie. None of it all. I obviously couldn't see the merit. Absolutely boring and empty. I wouldn't be able to classify this movie. And by the looks of it neither could Imdb which tagged the movie as adventure, comedy, drama, family, fantasy, romance. In short, not really sure what one is looking at. If the idea was to convey a 60 fell to it, that also fails. I don't know whether this movie might appeal to a younger audience, but for me it did nothing.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
More heart than soul,"This movie seems like Wes Anderson wanted to make another movie but didn't really know what about, so he just decided to copy The Life Aquatic's aesthetic without including the interesting bits.The directors want us to believe that the two young protagonists are anti-social and quirky, but none of the other kids act any differently and most of the adults are similarly callous. You're not setting your protagonists apart when everyone acts the same, and this was a problem throughout the movie. It doesn't really give us an opportunity to connect to the characters, who just seem to get involved in a series of increasingly bizarre moments with the same level of apathy and dryness throughout except for the surprisingly rushed love story, which is cute and innocent enough.But the actors did play their parts. The two child leads were believable in their crush for each other and their social ineptitude. They weren't really the problem as much as the script rendering them normal in the universe. Bill Murray was funny, Norton and Willis did well playing the only two adults who seem to almost be real people. It does seem like they put their heart into it, there just wasn't enough substance for them to put their effort in to, which is saying a lot for a Wes Anderson movie.In the end, it just comes off as a generic Wes Anderson movie. Personally, I'd rather watch The Life Aquatic again, but if your'e a big Wes Anderson fan, then you'll probably love it.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kids movie but even kids won't like it,A highly overrated movie. It doesn't deserve more than 4 star. Watching this in 2018 but feels like who was that moron who made this movie.Movie is very boring. Maybe the first 15 mins of intro.. people may like it. But as the movie proceeds it gives headache don't know what to do weather to watch forward or leave it in middle. I would recommend to leave it because this movie is just waste of time.Save your precious time don't watch this movie. You will regret watching it.,1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Disappointed,"This is one of those films that could have been good, but the inappropriate scenes involving children just ruined the film for me. It starts out unique and interesting, and the plot and manner of bringing forth the plot is definitely something you don't see every day. I generally enjoy those kinds of films. But this film should have been rated ""R"" due to the content with children who are supposed to be 12 years of age. I was shocked and disappointed.Obviously there are some pretty big names in this film. I thought the acting was well done. A critic called the movie ""heartwarming."" I would not call it that, but the script was intelligently written, and accurately reminds me of those days of not feeling understood by one's parents, and not understanding them back, and having family dysfunction. But again I just can't believe the content involving children. It's one thing to have adults behaving in such a manner, but not children for the entertainment purposes of others.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"This movie ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is awful.","7.8 is the current average rating of Moonrise Kingdom. So, I started watching this movie considering it might not be an excellent movie but it could be a good one for spending some free time. Unfortunately, it was boring from the start. In the middle, I even wanted to left it unwatched. I do not know why this movie have such a good rating. The whole story is so boring that I consider I have wasted my time watching it. I am unable to find any reason for rating this movie higher than 1. It's not comedy because it didn't made me laugh. Not even once. It's romantic but only kids would like it. So, overall this movie ""Moonrise Kingdom"" is awful.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful waste of time.,"Great acting, cinematography, sets, everything, all in the service of a playful romp. Much as I like this ""type"" of film, I've never felt that watching a film was such a complete waste of my time. It seemed so pointless.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Should have received at least 8 stars except one thing that spoiled it for me.,"Here is a quirky movie with good actors that SHOULD have been fun. Lots of fun and it made me smile until one particular scene that just RUINED it for me. It was totally unnecessary! It was like dining in a 4 star restaurant and finding a cockroach
in a 200 dollar meal. I stopped watching and never saw the rest of the film.
The ""Cockroach"" in this instance is a scene that shows a dog shot in the neck with an arrow. TOTALLY NOT NECESSARY to the story and irresponsible to boot. Shame on the writer, director and producers.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Load of rubbish,"Seriously, this was one of the tackiest films made. Wes Anderson tries way to hard to impress, trying to stylize the film in the same manner as some of Kubricks work. The minor moments of 'special FX' used in this film were terrible, looked like the effects were made on a smart phone or bad green screen.The story line was good, but again it felt like a bad episode of Ally McBeal, trying way to hard to be zany. Amongst all the bad shone a bit of good, the actors are naturally fantastic, being veterans and well known. And the main child actors were great and will no doubt grow into fantastic actors.But still, very poor humor and no doubt aimed at viewers who don't really have much going on in their lives in the way of funny or weird moments so they look to this film for hope and quirkiness. 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Recycled Wes Anderson Formula,"Although this film was enjoyable, I was constantly distracted because I couldn't help but recognize every lead character in the film. Anderson is a one trick pony who has somehow managed to put the same dis-connected characters in the same dis-functional families and stick them in a new setting and slightly different scenarios, place a different title on the cover and convince studios that it's something new. I was hopeful due to the rave reviews and success of this film in limited release but I feel deceived and cheated. If you aren't already familiar with Anderson's films, you will enjoy watching this story but if you are, you will likely be just as disappointed as I was.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not at all what I expected,"I remembered seeing the cast list and I thought that it would be awesome. I guess I really didn't pay close enough attention to the plot. I may not have been in the mood. But, I was disappointed. I'm definitely going to give it another go. Basic opinion is you really need to watch the film and give it a go.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
pointless,"first of all, if you are going to make a movie where most characters are kind of 'weird' or exaggerated like in a fairytale you have to make sure that the story fits the atmosphere you are creating by that. this movie fails to do so. therefore a lot of scenes just seem pointless and boring. creating a comedy this way is even more of a challenge. they shouldn't have gone there. it does not work. it's not funny.the story is too realistic in a way, and the direction is chaotic (this narrator guy that showed up a couple of times, what was that about?), the characters feel misplaced like taken from another movie (that maybe had a fitting story). i did like the story though, don't get me wrong, it just does not fit.also there are some nice shots of that island. and i cared enough for the characters to watch until the end. but that was a really tough decision. i was very bored at the same time.i don't know what the director had in mind, i don't see it. it's a mess, really. a little like in 'hugo cabret' but that story was way more fitting. It reminds me a lot of 'the royal tenenbaums' and i didn't like that one either.and to make this clear: actors that never smile may be weird (which can be a good thing) but they are also boring, and it greatly reduces the connection the audience can have with them. so if you decide to do that you have to make sure that you can make up for that somehow. personally i find it annoying, and i feel like someone should go see a psychiatrist with them (not for treatment, just diagnosis). if the story allows such thoughts. and it does.am i repeating myself? alright, i'll stop.ill give it a 5 because of some interesting dialogs, some really well 'designed' shots, the scenery of the island and a sweet story.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
blargh,"I didn't know what to expect with Moonrise Kingdom, but I definitely expected more than this.Moonrise Kingdom tries to imitate the feel of the 60's with simple palettes and costumes. All this does is makes it extremely boring, visually. Moonrise Kingdom is saturated with the yellow of the scouts and is purged of most interesting colors elsewhere. I felt no emotional investment or interest in any of the characters, though the girl and boy are likable.Its playful music (which was very nicely done, actually), crashes unpleasantly with Moonrise's deadpan atmosphere.Moonrise Kingdom's 60's feel is taken to such an unpleasant and bizarre extreme, that this 'world of wonder' becomes a sickening and obnoxious place.Not recommended.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
same ol' same ol',"I've been getting into Wes Anderson flicks for a while now and was truly excited to see Moonrise Kingdom. I could not have been more disappointed in this movie than I already am. Without going into detail, I really liked the story, but it's as if Mr. Anderson has nothing new to bring to the table. It almost feels as if he ran out of ideas so he decided to milk every trick in his book to the point of the movie feeling like a caricature of a Wes Anderson flick. There were some good moments in the film, however, it felt quite uninspired. A great cast with what seemed like little charisma. I would like to think that I'd watch it again while keeping an open mind, but I can't say it will be any time soon. All in all, I can't give it more than a 4. I am definitely glad that I was not able to fork out the cash to catch it in the theater.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie from a great director,"I don't have anything in particular to complain about this movie.

Could Have Been Much Better,"I saw this movie at a sneak preview screening in Frankfurt, Germany today. That means I didn't know what movie I was going to see when I walked into it. Anyway, I hadn't heard of the movie before today. The movie started out so boring that I was ready to walk out after about 20 minutes. I ended up not leaving because I was there with a date. The entire movie ended up being extremely boring. There were many cute scenes about childhood romance that almost anyone can relate too. The story was cute and I think they could have made so much more out of it, but the movie contained some scenes that I found to be too graphic (pedophile) for the actors acting out the scenes. There were also too many boring parts for a movie this short. Some parts of the story were also just plain stupid and took away from the movie.I don't know what else to say but I gotta fill up ten lines. I can't believe that they won't let me write only as much as I have to say. The movie wasn't good! Nuff said!",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Most Annoying Protagonist Ever,"What am I missing here? Is it illegal to say that this movie was bad? I get that Wes Anderson attracts A-list actors and has a quirky directorial style. I agree that stills from his movies ( reluctant to call them films) are beautifully shot and perfectly centered/balanced, but nobody in the movie rises above their marquee name to convince us that they are the character they are portraying.I watched well-known actors read lines in a story I didn't care about, while everyone else seems to think it was high art. My bad? Maybe, but I don't think so. Is it wrong to hope that the lead character gets hit by a bus? If so, my apologies.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Pathbreaking, Unlike anything you have ever vitnessed on screen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I finished watching this movie at 3AM and instead of fallin asleep after,I decided to write a review coz believe me, this movie was UNLIKE anything I have ever seen in my entire life. To begin with ,the movie starts on a low note but once you allow it to grow on you,it becomes a heavenly experience.Most of the movies get to you through your head,this is where MOONRISE KINGDOM differs it gets to you through your heart.This movie is filled with innocence,humor and melancholy. Coming down to the script,it is carefully and delicately written,but the way in which Wes Anderson has portrayed it on screen is what lays its path to your heart.It has some of the hallmarks of his previous movies like Eccentric characters,Off-beat sense of humor,story book visuals etc. but still there is something immensely likable about this movie.I am not going in detail about the story as the mere description of the plot in no way prepares you for the sheer brilliance and the delightful quirkiness of his work.Anderson has cleverly worked on the plot and in here there is a scenario where the kids have the exact idea of what they are destined to do and the adults here are the troubled ones ,they panic and are clueless over how exactly to handle the situation.The movie is immensely whimsical and witty and gives us a feel of vitnessing a quirky fairy tale due to its overstylized production design. On the performance side Murray and McDormand are pitch-perfect as a pair of married lawyers unplugged from each other and their kids.Edward Norton also does well as the scout leader who sends his troops for hilarious missions.But the true show stealer is MR.Willis with a moving performance as the tedious cop who has never found true love and finally last but not the least,the movie's protagonists – the immensely talented Jared Gilman and Kara Hayward–whose weird,endearing romance is the beating heart of this emotionally honest movie. Please do watch this movie on big screen or on blu-ray for this movie exhibits cinematographic brilliance,shot entirely on 16mm sepia,hats off to the cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman. Watch this movie if your childhood was awesome and it will show you a heartfelt portrayal of first love and how such love inspires the lives of people who encountered it.Feel it,for it will take you back to innocence. Thanks to all the folks who read the review,enjoy.........CHEEEERRRSSSSS!!:-)",,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful visuals,"This film is about a young boy scout running off with his teenage girlfriend on an isolated island. Other boy scouts and local residents search for them under terrible weather conditions.""Moonrise Kingdom"" has beautiful visuals. The scenery is always beautiful. Sets are thoughtfully presented, such as scouts marching in the background wen main characters are talking, the distinctive tree house location etc. The retro colour scheme fits the film very well too. The two teenagers' performances are very good, they look so pure and natural. The stellar cast of adult characters stand out as well, I particularly like Edward Norton's master scout character. Tilda Swinton is not immediately recognisable, but she is a memorable character as well.""Moonrise Kingdom"" is an accessible Wes Anderson film. It is mainstream enough, while still maintaining its quirkiness.",,Anonymous,Romance
