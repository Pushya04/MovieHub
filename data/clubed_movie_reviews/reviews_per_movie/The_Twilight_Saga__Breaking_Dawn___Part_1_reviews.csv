A vampire movie/paranormal romance but without the bite...,"I am neither a Twilight fan or a Twilight detractor. This said, I am indifferent to the franchise. As far as the movies, I still think, coming from someone whose knowledge of the books only comes from my sister being a fan and me reading a chapter of one and putting it down, that the best is Eclipse(not saying much) and New Moon the worst. But that is not a consolation really. Breaking Dawn: Part 1 is not quite among the worst of the year and nowhere near among the worst ever, however it suffers from some major problems that I will get to later in the review.So what was it that got me seeing Breaking Dawn: Part 1 in the first place? The answer was its director, Bill Condon. I am familiar with his previous films and find him a promising director and writer, finding his films well written, observed and acted. Gods and Monsters is amazing and one of my favourites, Kinsey was interesting and Dreamgirls elevated by the soundtrack and cast was quite decent. Did Condon do a good job directing? For me, I am not sure. I'd say of the four Twilight movies so far Breaking Dawn: Part 1 has the most cinematic feel to it, on the other hand there is not much here that made Condon's previous films so good and I'd go as far to say it is the film of his that engaged me the least.Are there any redeeming qualities to this instalment? I think so actually. Although there are moments of sloppy editing, I did like the look of the film. At some points it was quite Gothic, and at others it had either an evergreen or autumnal feel to it. The scenery often does look stunning, the effects are okay I guess and the cinematography especially with the close-ups of the back of the wedding dress and the final shot is some of the best of the franchise in my opinion.I also liked Carter Burwell's score. I like Burwell a lot, his music has a hypnotic and quite hauntingly beautiful quality to it. For my tastes though some of the pop tunes are on the insipid side, however the score itself was pleasant with a lot of what I like about Burwell evident.Much has been said about the sex scene. In all honesty I was expecting it to be of hilariously cheesy quality, but somehow Condon brought a little more subtlety than I was expecting. The last thirty minutes was perhaps the most exciting Breaking Dawn: Part 1 got, as some of does have purpose and intensity, which was something that the first half of the film did not have.There are also two good performances, Billy Burke and Michael Sheen, the latter being another point of interest. Burke as always is amusing with some of the better lines of the film(though is that saying much do you think?), while Sheen, ever the great actor, adopts a menace and magnetism as Aro without overdoing it too much. Ashley Greene is also quite good, if not great.I have to say I still don't think much of the acting of the central trio. Kristen Stewart is much better than she is in New Moon, with much less of the moping and dead pauses, but some of her line delivery is still awkward and her facial expressions for my tastes are lifeless. It doesn't help though that Bella is a rather dull character.Robert Pattinson has more to do than he did in New Moon and is less hammy than in the first film(the looking into the camera moments brought moments of unintentional laughter when I first went to see Twilight when it came out). As a matter of fact this is perhaps his best performance of the series and he is certainly the best of the central trio, but like Stewart some of the line delivery could've been more inspired.Taylor Lautner on the other hand is getting worse and worse. He is hunky to be sure, but does that alone make you a good actor? Not to me. I will give credit and say he is better than he was in this year's Abduction, where both the film and performance were awful, but the more dramatic moments from him felt forced and overplayed, and throughout there was a very stilted nature about him. A lot of the problem is to do with the writing. The dialogue in the Twilight franchise never was particularly good, saying this though in terms of written quality this is Twilight at its most banal, its most clunky and its most cheesy. The characters are clich√©d and underdeveloped too, and at the end of the day you don't care for anybody. Oh, and the talking wolves were poorly done and unintentionally funny.The story is very bland and unengaging, not to mention thin structurally and in content. The whole of the first half reads little more than ponderous melodrama. Was the wedding lavish? Yes it was. But it was also plodding and over-extended. The second half fares better, still with the clunky dialogue, uneven acting and cheesy, underdeveloped plot points and characterisations, but as I said the last thirty minutes or so serves as the highlight of the film. But for me what killed the film was the pace. Mind you, I have seen movies with slow pacing, but they are often paced deliberately and with strong meanings, great acting and dialogue and identifiable characters. With little of that here, Breaking Dawn: Part 1 not only is dull and plodding but also uninteresting and without bite.Overall, despite my admiration for Condon and Sheen, this didn't work. The ending is highly suggestive of a continuation, which I understand is happening. If so, I do hope it will be better than this. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Til Death Do Us Start...,"The Bella of the ball has gone and dropped it, now she's ballooning, and it looks as if she might split, is she carrying a curse, that will smash the dream and burst, or will the wounds reseal, re-knit and close the slit.It's a shame they didn't turn it into three, two hour films of nothing much would be such glee, we could watch them painting walls, watch them dry, then watch leaves fall, while under moonlight watch them swimming in the sea.Breaking Yawn!",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad work,"The movie is not to the level of expectation. Although, the book is better, it is hard to represent everything in visual. The worst part of the movie is releasing it as two parts. Anyway let bygones be bygones. The performance of Kristen is fantastic. But the rest of the team don't support her performance. The nocturnal fight can be made better with little increase in brightness. Twilight series is in the high level of expectation to the people who don't read book. Let us expect some good plot in conclusion.One famous critic says the following. "" Based on a portion of the popular teen romance book ""Breaking Dawn"" this slow-moving film has long periods of inaction and generates little suspense, making it the worst film in the ""Twilight Saga"" films so far. This movie seems to be a mere multimillion dollar bookmark, marking time until the overarching story is finally concluded in the last film. Short on plot developments and long on inaction, the characters spend much of the film waiting for something, anything to happen.This third film in the Twilight Saga opens with the marriage of the human Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) to the vampire Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson). This is followed by the honeymoon in South America. A good deal of time is spent in transit to and from South America. Although a private jet is involved in this trip, most of the traveling scenes are in cars or limousines. These are awkward sequences where nothing really happens. When the newlyweds finally have sex, the act is underplayed, and not repeated during the honeymoon. Once again, the chastity theme comes to the fore as the husband broods over the safety of his wife and his wife's bruises resulting from his partial loss of self-control during sex.So the bride and groom are on their honeymoon on a fancy island resort, but they are still waiting for something else to happen, namely the act of turning Bella into an vampire. Why they don't just go ahead and get it over with isn't explained very well. When Bella's other boyfriend, Jacob the werewolf (Taylor Lautner) finds out about this human-vampire honeymoon idea, he thinks it is crazy. While everyone is waiting for Bella to become a vampire, something else happens. Bella becomes pregnant. This, of course, requires more waiting to see what happens with the pregnancy.After more limo scenes, the bride and groom head back to the family compound in Washington where they spend the rest of the film waiting to find out what happens with the baby. More waiting, more interminable chastity. Just like any marriage. There is a brief flurry of action at the end of the film when another battle between the vampires and werewolves starts to flare up, for no good reason, by the way. During all this, amazingly, nobody bothers to tell Bella's father that she might be dying, or that she has decided to join the undead vampires anyway, even if she survives the birth. Instead, Bella lies to her father, telling him she is at a spa in Switzerland. I guess everyone decides that Bella's father has no right to be at his daughter's side as she fights for her life. This is just heartless and wrong, but it is just one of many wrong things in this twisted story.I'm not going to go into the film's ending, but almost all of the plot and what little action there is in the film is back loaded into the last few minutes of the film. The film's running time of nearly two hours is overlong. It is more like one hour of plot padded out to two hours. Surprisingly, the one character who undergoes much of a change in the film (until the last second of the film) is Jacob. While most of the characters in the film are passive and childlike, Jacob actually grows up and becomes an adult in the film. He takes a stand against the leader of his wolf pack and starts his own pack. Unfortunately, this doesn't last long. He reverts back to passivity because of something called ""imprinting"" and once again loses his will. Completing the image of loss of will, he even falls to his knees as if he were worshiping the baby Jesus in Bethlehem.I get the feeling this film is similar to ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part One."" It seems to be an artificial creation, manufactured to make an additional $700 million that the studio would not have gotten if they had just made one ""Breaking Dawn"" film instead of two. If you are going to make movies of a series of books and you plan to make the movies true to the books, then do that. Don't try to manufacture additional movies by splitting a book in two. It doesn't work. At least it hasn't worked with the Harry Potter and Twilight franchises. This film rates a D.""",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
TWILIGHT BREAKING DAWN,"I'd say, stay for the first 15 minutes then come back for the last 20 minutes, just so that you can skip all of the nonsense in between. Surprisingly, the werewolves have taken a dire turn in this franchise which is a crying shame because their presence in the two other films were refreshing and light handed. In one of the worst scenes ever, they all confront each other through telepathy which is hard to watch because the voice acting is so out of place. The wedding scene was gratuitous and the birth scene was ripped out from the pages of hell. Bizzare.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A brilliant example of wooden acting and bad movie making,"It is a sad world in which such talentless display of acting, screenplay and direction gets any recognition whatsoever.You do not care about any of the characters, nor is there any chemistry between the supposed lovers Bella and Edward, calling it wooden would be a compliment,instead it is a bored and effortless ""going through the motions and I could not care less performance..."" Exhibiting with that a huge disrespect for their audience...!Edward is suppose to be this strong and wise immortal, but instead I see a stupid weakling who faced with any sort of danger at all would appear to rather lay down crying than to stand up for himself..., there is truly no strength of body or soul in him at all, at times it seems he'd rather be Bella... and as for Bella(KStew), it is sad to see how one merchandise has ruined the blossoming of a good actress... it almost appears the Twilight saga has sucked the soul out of her... perhaps she'll recover, perhaps she won't.I enjoyed the books very much, to my shame. However, this latest instalment has finally managed to kill all my imagined magic this Sage might have once held for me. I finally grew up...",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bill Condon disappointed me,"This film was sad... I was expecting something better, especially because Bill Condon was directing this. He directed one of my favourite movies of all time, ""Gods and Monsters"" alongside with other movies like ""Kinsey"" or ""Dreamgirls"". Considering this, I was very disappointed.The original score of this film is not at all appealing and combined with the bad sound editing makes the movie difficult and unpleasant to listen to.(I mean while you are watching it, it doesn't sound good; you know what I mean). Although some people found the acting ""mesmerizing"", I thought it was dull and how could it be any different in a movie where almost nothing happens. The script was empty and had no sparkle whatsoever.I consider this movie had no chance of being good from the start, because to me, the premise seems idiotic. I know it's a romantic vampire film, but at least make me believe the humans in this movie are in their right minds.All in all, I do not think this was the worst movie in the series. I think The Twilight Saga: New Moon still has that covered. But I am fairly disappointed in Bill Condon because, not only did he choose to be part of this project, but above all, this film was not directed well.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Horrible and boring,"They just can not act, I do not know why they still getting with this girl but she is terrible actor, she can't transmit her emotions and that is the first opposite for an actor, it just was boring.Oh and Edward wasn't shining under the sun in Brazil, they forgot that part, and that's a huge mistake in vampire movie if he doe's not afraid of the sun light.They could do better then this but before change the actress she is horrible in acting.Cutting the movie in parts was a terrible Idea too, its not like a Harry Potter containing to much information its just a love story movie that does not transmits love.So in a few words it was HORRIBLE AND BORING.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not a good adaption of the best book in the series,"Up front I will say that I am a huge fan of the Twilight Saga. Breaking Dawn being the last and IMO the best of the books in the series. I have read the book 6 times so far and will be reading it again.While the film follows the book reasonably closely I was disappointed with some of the license that was taken with the adaption. The most disappointing were the fight scenes between the vampires and the wolves, anyone who has read the book will know exactly what I mean. No further needs to be said here.The acting that has been remarked on by other reviewers in this was no different to any of the previous movies in the series as far as I was concerned and I was happy with most of the movie. People who remarked on the woodenness of the acting do not seem to take into account way Edward reacted towards Bella in the book and I was not overly concerned with it at all. The only things that brought the movie down for me were the changes that were made to the story, these spoiled the movie for me.The movie ended at the point that I expected it to end and I look forward to the next and last installment. I only hope they do not change too much from the book, as I believe the next part is the best of the lot.Grudging 5 out of 10 for me. I would have given it a 6.5-7 but for the changes that messed up the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boring,"If you're a big time fan of the books, you have probably hyped yourself up to a fevered expectation rendering you incapable of any objectivity. This film, of it's own merit, would have never made it to the theaters. In a word, it is very ""boring""... unless your hyped, it bites! (pun intended). Many of the scenes were obvious fillers with terrible dialogue. The acting was so-so from most of the lead performers, with the sole exception being Billy Burke (Charlie), who appears to be a very good actor. About half way through the film I kept looking at my watch hoping the 117 minutes would be over soon.I am being forced at this point to continue writing when in fact I have nothing more to say about this boring sequel of a film called Breaking Dawn. According to the rules ones' review must be at least 10 lines minimum. So what you're reading right now is the completely unnecessary and unpleasantly annoying filler, mandated by IMDb.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (2011),"I hate Twilight a lot. But nobody can say I am unfair towards it. The third film was actually entertaining and less infuriating. Breaking Dawn Part 1, is different altogether. It is just a horrible product shoved out with no regard for its audience. Bella and Edward get married and go on honeymoon, this last for over an hour. She gets pregnant, which shouldn't be able to happen, and some potentially evil demon baby is sucking the life from her. The films biggest crime is that nothing happens for so long. This series has had a tendency to drag on and on. With New Moon seeming totally unnecessary. What happens here, is that we get one book split into two films. This film has about 30 minutes of material in it. Characters have the same conversations they've had a thousand times before, with nobody evolving. Bella and Edward feel the same way they've always felt, as does Jacob. The sex scene is embarrassingly juvenile, with a quick cut to something from a parody. The film doesn't let up in the absurdity department, as some animated wolves have a conversation with each other, but with mindless growling and dialog, it sounds terrible. What any other film would have shortened into a montage is played out to a variety of banal songs that all sound the same. Finally we get towards the end and the graphic, grotesque birth scene is barely shown at all. It leaves us with a finale in which a wolf ""imprints"" himself onto a newborn baby in a scene more disturbing than anything The Human Centipede could muster. If you like characters that whine about everything, actors that have no emotional range, and watching slideshows of other people's honeymoons, then you may enjoy this laughable effort.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
If you are not a twilight fan you are definitely not gonna like it,"To rate this movie I think I should split my opinion in two: The twilighter side and the neutral side. Read the part that better mirrors your attitude.NEUTRAL: The movie has no cinematographic value at all. Just a lame, slow, in places disgusting report of how a vampire-human marriage could be in the first part, and a badly directed (with some very awkward moments) plot development in the second part. I could not help noticing the derisiveness of some scenes; e.g. the one in which the transformed Jacob addresses his other fellows (I thought the movie was turning into a joke at that very moment!) and the one in which Bella makes the bloodshake fall to the ground and kind of breaks her back. A praise goes to the actors: the acting is not bad, is not bad at all considering that, in my opinion, nothing better could have been done (Kristen Stewart's performance is not bad and I found very convincing the character of Jacob). Another criticize goes to the movie slowness; in fact, those who are not very fond of Ed and Bell's love story might probably find the fully detailed and slow part in which the two get married really annoying. Finally, I would rate this movie, in this case, with 4,5 out of 10.TWILIGHTER: I do think very few fans will be disappointed by this installment. Let's be onest, I was almost crying during the scene of the wedding (and I'm a male!!!) mainly because of my affection for the series (I was platonically in love with the story when the first Twilight movie came out). That's the truth: this movie's been made just for those who have always followed and liked the Twilight saga. I don't expect anyone to suddenly turn up and say: I've never given a *** about this series but I've found the movie absolutely awesome! This movie is for us Twilighters all around the world. Because all those scenes have an emotional meaning only in case you are very fond of the series. In this case I can and want turn many blind eyes (may I say it? haha) in the name of my affection for the saga. I enjoyed the Ed and Bell's wedding night, all those particulars (they even play chess!) that made me feel good during the projection of this movie. In this case I would rate the movie with 9 out of 10.That's all, according to my opinion. Thanks for reading.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simply Entertaining For Those Who Love The Story,"As a grown woman with many life experience years behind me, I fell in love with the books and I really like the movies. Breaking Dawn, pt.1, delivered for me. I have come to love the actors who portray the beloved characters. The movie was very entertaining and I plan to see it again. Was it perfect, no. Could it have been better, maybe. Did it satisfy me, yes. Did the director and actors translate the book to film, I think so. Am I going to waste on second tearing any part of it down, no. It is an escape. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I laughed at times, I cried during the wedding scene, and I held my breath during the sex scene. I eagerly await the final film and will be sad when it's over. Kudos guys, you did well.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"OK, but without much content","There is not much happening altogether in this film. They put way too much focus on the wedding and the honeymoon, thus wasting precious time. But I guess all those teenage girl fans wanted a full portrayal of the big romantic wedding.In all of the previous films, I liked the acting of most of the cast a lot. But in this film, everyone except Bella, Edward & Jacob is marginalised to such an extent that there cannot be much said about them. As an audience you just don't get to see enough of any of them to really develop a connection with or care about them.Altogether this is an OK addition to the franchise, by no means worse than the disappointing/confusing 2nd or 3rd films. I assume I will give this film either a 5 or a 6 (out of 10), but I think I will withhold my final vote until I have seen part 2. I know some might say that they are released as separate films and therefore should be treated as such, but as the original book is ripped into two halves here, I think it is fair to reserve the final judgement until I have seen the two films in conjunction (seeing that, as I haven't read the books, I will need to have seen both films in order to make sense of it all).",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breaking Dawn: Breaking Hearts,"Breaking Dawn has been breaking box office records since its release. Sadly though, I really can't see why.Aside from the importance of the wedding to be shown, and the last 30 minutes of it that ""saved-the-bell"", this movie is boring.The only thing about the movie that I liked is the fact that, in this installment, Jacob Black owned Edward Cullen.Not being a fan of the series, the book, nor the story, should make me expect less.However, that is not a reason for this, or any film to be made this bad.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst movies ever made,"I watched the first movie in the saga because my wife loved the books. I must say, the acting was good, except for Stewart who is a cold fish. She looks confused or depressed. That is the scope of her acting abilities. The character development was good. The plot was good. And there was enough suspense, mystery and action to make the movie solid.New Moon introduced the werewolves and Volturi, which added new mystery and suspense. But the Volturi were never heard from again.In Eclipse, no werewolf makes an appearance until over an hour into the film. And you are already snoring within 40 minutes.Finally, Breaking Dawn. In the first hour we see a wedding and honeymoon full of pathetic dialog, weak acting, and ZERO imagination. It was slower than a Lifetime production, with less romance, mystery, intrigue, suspense, and action. Stewart's character states it was the best night of her life, yet still not even a smile. She would be fantastic if casted as a corpse.After watching Rise of the Planet of the Apes, the CG werewolves look like they were rendered in 1991. They look to be about 1200 pounds. They snarl and human voices are heard... but their bark is worst than their bite as no one dies or even gets injured. There movements and interaction with their environment look extremely fake.The final 10 seconds of the film hold the only suspense or intrigue in the entire movie. These greedy bastards just want teens to pay for two movies when they could have rolled it into one. They could have started the movie with ""I Do"", shown a quick scene of Bella getting knocked up and getting morning sickness, then the 15 minute finale. This movie was simply a 20 minute prelude to Part Two stretched into 2 hours.Get your neighbor to rent it, borrow it for 30 minutes and watch the last 15 minutes and you are ready for Part Two.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dragging out what should be a quick ending.,"I like twilight. i wouldn't say i LOVE it, but i found the books to be amusing, warm and a good time waster. The movies seem to be more about capitalising on funds rather than delivering a decent plot.i've never been a fan of Kristin Stewart (insipid droning teenager that she is in all of the movieS) but she actually appears to present somewhat of a decent acting skill in this movie, whereas cold, boring edward (who in the books was a heart-throb) is just as terribly pathetic as he was in the previous movies. The man that has stolen the show, taylor lautner, since he took his shirt off in the second movie was pushed into the background a little bit in this movie, which i think was the worst thing they could have done. but, in the same token, they had to do as its a love story between edward and bella, not bella and jacob. I'm just a little disappointed by the way they've dragged this on. but i was disappointed by the books towards the end too.We took our whole office at the penrith professionals and there were mixed reviews. The oldies hated it, the middle agers (who knew the basic plot line of the movie) found it a nice romance but fairly boring and the young girls loved it for the sheer fact it was twilight.I wouldn't see it again, thats for sure.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
The worst one so far,To some extent to a great extent I enjoyed the three previous films this stunk of a studio cashing in on making 2 parts when only one was needed until the closing scenes pretty much nothing happened and the film was a total bore fest hopefully part two is better!,4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Here is hoping that Part 2 has a little more action!,I adore the franchise. I hated it when I first watched Twilight but with time I am a complete fan and couldn't wait to watch this episode.I have not read the books but I kind of wished I had done as I am continually reminded how much better they are.This is surely the last stepping stone though as I found myself wondering if there will ever be any action or real confrontations! I always get the feeling i am being short changed by the studios! The fight scene between Edward and the Volteri in New Moon and the mini war with the new borns just seemed too rushed and under used. There is no action in this movie however I had prepared myself for that.I can simply say it like it really has to be said..... Don't watch it if you ain't seen all the others or you ain't a fan.... You simply come on this site to discourage others. For the Twilight fans amongst us.... and I am a grown man certainly not lusting after the Edward and Jacob crews (definately a Rosalie fan however) its a certainty that you will enjoy it and be gripped into the final installment which is far too far away!!!,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

cheesy awkward!,"as we all know twilight saga has always been weird this time its awkward. With the whole Edward Jacob team thing i never chose one side, but breaking Dawn woouhh! Edward, I mean Jacob did better then other movies too he has a round character for the first time instead of just anger, he is cute, funny, sad as always. The good thing is the cute scenes when Edward talks. I know that sounds ridiculous, but hes done really good and he looks better then before. Bella hmm well, her acting is horrible in some beginning scenes, the way she conveys her dialogues are just just justifying at all. all other character like Alice, Jasper, Rose, Carloisle etc if it weren't for them the rest of the movie except the honeymoon scenes would be just not worth of watch. Some scenes are confusing especially at the end and not to be a spoiler but once with Jacob. ;). anyways for me the only best part the wedding its pretty funny, cute and the honeymoons funny and romantic.

"Dawn is breaking, and the audience is going to sleep","Taking a nose dive down from the certain enthusiasm that was visible in Eclipse, the Twilight saga just went from lean and mean, back to boring and broody.Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a film so confusing in its execution that if it were not for the overall lack of blood, I might assume it was a Roger Corman film. It is vile and unsympathetic, and the strangest part is that the way it ends, you might feel like there is no way that a part 2 is necessary. Part 1, might have even been that much more powerful without the knowledge that another film is on the way. This one concludes in the sort of manner that gives the audience an opportunity to use their imagination. Subsequently, the ending is the only good part of the movie; the rest is nonsense.In addition to having the worst acting of any of the films yet, the character interaction is once again beyond explanation. Most of the movie is spent in the Cullen household with the family and Jacob trying to keep Bella alive, while the baby inside her is draining her of life. A lot of useless dialogue gets exchanged in addition to a lot of grumbling (mostly from Jacob ... again). I also found it humorous how everybody waits for each other to finish a sentence in scenes that are suppose to be filled with panic. These are the kind of scenes where everyone should be scrambling and interrupting each other among other things. I felt like I was watching a play at times. Some credit should go towards the make up department for making Bella look scrawny and disgusting in the latter scenes. The quality of her face now matches the quality of her line delivery.Breaking Dawn, in trying to be a little bit more dark and sinister than the previous movies, instead has become more boring. There's no other simple way to put it ... it's just boring.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"For fans of the book, well worth watching","This latest chapter captures the emotions of the book and of this part of the characters' lives. Each event is fleshed out, from Edward's revealing again to Bella about the killings he has committed, Bella's apprehensive dreams, the Quiletes discussing imprinting, the feelings of all involved in the wedding, and most effectively, Edward's anguish as his loved one is slipping away. Edward has his most emotional scenes to date. Most of the special effects are done more convincingly than in the previous Twilight films. If you are looking for porn in the honeymoon scene, you won't find it; instead you will find sweetness and eroticism between two people who have waited for one another and are very much in love. A fitting beginning of the end for the saga.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The best Twilight movie so far!,I'm not going to go crazy with a long review. Everyone knows what Twilight is and most people already know of they love it or hate it. As a die hard fan of the books I had high expectations for the movies. The actors have matured immensely since the first movie and in my opinion they played their characters *perfectly* in this movie. I was blown away with how accurate this movie was in comparison to the book. I only noticed a few small differences which would probably go unnoticed to a normal Twilight fan. I mainly wanted to write this review to tell the fans to ignore the haters. Most of the bad reviews that I read on IMDb sound and look like they are written by people who didn't even see the movie. I was impressed by this movie and if you are a fan of any of the previous movies you will thoroughly enjoy this one.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the climax wedding and honeymoon portion of the franchise romance,"The Twilight books were a guilty pleasure, I enjoyed them (to a point). I don't pretend they were works of literary genius, or the plot was particularly clever, and don't get me started on sparkles, but they were a diversion and I bought them all and saw all the films (mainly on DVD).The first half of final book, which I believe shouldn't have been split into two halves as there isn't enough to spread out to four plus hours so consequently both films are riddled with montages and scenes that don't really move the story on; especially the honeymoon and all the chess games for example. The broken up bedroom after their wedding night is funny, and I like the Director didn't shy away from scenes with skin in them in order to keep it for younger audiences given the basic naivety of the majority of the rest of the films. It's a nice film, the wedding very sweet, and all the preparations lovely but again it's the interaction with the Quileutes and the vampire clan that are best. This gets interesting when Bella gets pregnant at super speed and the pregnancy causes a lot of issues including twitchy wolves and scary Volturi. Anything with the Volturi bring an added dimension to the story but they're all a little cheesy and camp rather than scary. Whilst Martin Sheen is a great actor, the fear factor works better on the page than on the screen.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointed........and I really wanted to like this movie.,"I loved the books and all the movies, except this one. I think the problem is the director. This guy was clueless when it came to vampires and wolfs. He did a good job with the honeymoon and with Bella's scenes after she returns from the honeymoon, but everything else was not good. The wolfs seemed average size and the wolfs communicating was a disaster, and where's the Cullen family and the interaction between Jacob and his pack? If this movie had been directed by the one who did New Mood, you would have seen a really good movie, but with this director, we are just seeing an OK movie. I'm almost afraid too see what he's done with part II......",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An Hour & A Half Of Filler, Followed By Twenty Minutes Of Awesome.","Victoria is dead, there is no longer any threat to Bella. So she and Edward get married, while on their honeymoon they do the dirty deed and oops, Bella gets pregnant. Vampire pregnant, which means the fetus is growing at 5 times the normal rate and is killing her from within. The wolf clan cannot have this, as it breaks their treaty somehow and they come to kill the baby. Now Jacob must team up with the people he hates, the Cullens, in order to protect Bella.While this premise does sound interesting, it's a shame that the producers wanted to milk this poorly conceived franchise for every penny they can get. Instead of making one film, they split the story into two and Breaking Dawn Part 1 clearly suffers from over stuffing and filler. Nothing happens until the last twenty minutes of the film. We know they get married, we know they have sex and we know she gets pregnant. It takes way too long to get these plot points across. The wedding, the honeymoon and the pregnancy could have all happened in the first 30 minutes, but it's instead stretched to an obscene length.Books have more room to breath. The world is created an the writer has hundreds of pages to tell their story. Films don't have this luxury, so when a film comes out based on a book, you need to chop out the stuff that's simply not needed or wouldn't translate well to the screen. Since the people behind this film want to make more money, they split the last film into two. WB did the same for Harry Potter, but I can forgive them because there is actual story to tell in that film, here there is nothing. She doesn't get pregnant until 50 minutes into the film. Which means we are stuck with boring characters either being jealous of what others have (Jacob) or two people having sex over and over (Edward/Bella). The amount of time that was dedicated to the honeymoon is insane. What should have been a ten minute sequence, at most, takes about 30 minutes of screen time.Once Bella starts dying, the film tries to get into motion, but it's too late. When she goes into labor, that's when something finally interesting happens and the rest of the film makes for some of the most thrilling moments in the entire series. A standoff between the Cullens and the wolves is finally shown here, something that people have been waiting for since the first film. The tension between the two families finally explodes. This is exciting stuff, this is what people have been waiting for, but the film still suffers from bad CGI work when humans interact with the wolves. So the fight sequences, as exciting as they are, never really reach their full potential.The final frame of the film is so obvious half way through that I actually chuckled to myself when it happened. I still can't shake the feeling that the conflict of the whole series finished with Eclipse and what we have left is an overstretched denouement. Am I excited for the next film? Not really. Half the job of Part 1 is to get you excited for the next, this film fails horribly at that. What's left to happen? An after the credits sequences is shown where we are given a glimpse of what to expect, but I'm too far drawn away from the conflict by that point.Breaking Dawn is not the worst in the series, but clearly not the best. Had the film been one piece instead of two, then it would have been exciting. The simple fact that it drags on for so long is proof that splitting the film in two was a mistake, creatively. Financially, it's smart. Because young teenage girls will flock to anything, case in point -- this entire series.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
action washed away by suds,"If you're developing cold feet at the prospect of tying the knot - especially if you happen to be human and your intended a vampire - you may want to avoid watching ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"" written by Melissa Rosenberg and directed by Bill Condon. And if you are contemplating having a baby with a vampire, then you REALLY don't want to catch this fourth film based on the series of phenomenally successful novels by Stephanie Meyer.In this installment, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her dreamy vampire boyfriend Edward (Robert Pattinson) finally get hitched, but happiness is fleeting for the newlyweds as the still-human Bella finds herself coping with the most disturbing and problematic movie pregnancy since ""Rosemary's Baby"" (or ""Alien,"" if you want to count that as a pregnancy).In purely narrative terms, this is a fairly static entry in the series, as Bella wastes away to skeletal status through the ordeal, and everyone sits around discussing the moral implications of having an unprecedented cross-species child, especially when the birth experience itself will likely spell death for the mother. There's a halfhearted attempt at revving up the action when the werewolves threaten to intervene by killing Bella, but the star-crossed and loyalty-divided Jacob (Taylor Lautner) defuses the situation in quick order (it also leads to a ludicrous voice-over conversation among the wolves that provides some unintentional laughs for the audience).Still, Stewart gets to do more intense acting than she has thus far in the series, and Bella's transformation plus the addition of the child offer new story possibilities for ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2,"" due for release in November 2012.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable,"I very rarely disagree with IMDb ratings but in regards to The Twilight Saga films I find myself at odds with the average score. Whilst this film is not a 10 it certainly is not below a 5. I feel comfortable giving it a low 7.The film did feel slow in places, especially the first hour, but I think that was the director and screenwriter(s) driving home the fan favourite parts of the book plus introducing several characters for Part 2.Acting was solid. Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick were fantastic and steal any scene they were in. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart were both excellent. I felt Taylor did improve considerably in this installment.Overall, an enjoyable film, especially after the first hour. Plus the film sets everything up for the final film in the series.I would pay little attention to the IMDb score. At the time of writing this it has a score of 4.7. As time passes its likely it will drop further. The unweighted average is 6.3. If you break the voting down further into a male vs female of all ages you will see a huge difference (roughly 3.5 vs 7.5).I'll put it as simply as I can. If you did not enjoy at least 2 out of the last 3 Twilight films then its very likely you will not enjoy this plus it seems to help if you are female!Please remember when voting there are numbers between 1 and 10 (36% voted 10 and 23% voted 1). If you think this is the worst or best film you have ever seen you need to watch many more films, for your worst I'd recommend starting with anything that Uwe Boll or Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer directed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Unnecessarily Prolonged, Hilariously Cheesy","I stopped reading the Twilight books after ""Eclipse."" That book bored me to death and terminated any interest of reading the last book, ""Breaking Dawn."" We went to watch ""Breaking Dawn, Part 1"" just tonight because my wife really looking forward to it. I was grateful that I had not read the book, because curiosity about how the story would turn out was the only thing that kept me watching.The entire sequence from their wedding in the woods to their honeymoon in Brazil was maybe 45 minutes too long. They could have cut and compressed all of that hilariously cheesy stuff and maybe ""Breaking Dawn"" could have only been one movie, instead of two parts. As with the first three books, Bella continues to row her boat between the two rivers. Yes, even after her wedding to Edward, she continues to flirt with Jacob! Yet these two guys remain incredibly and illogically loyal to her. Anyhow, that was what Stephenie Meyer wrote, so fans of the book will be expecting that.The part about Bella's baby and how it was born was at least suspenseful. But this part only started maybe in the last 30 minutes of the whole film. The fight scenes with the wolves and vampires were too close-up to be clearly exciting. The medical aspects of the C-section were not to be taken seriously. The artificially white faces of the vampires especially on Carlisle and Emmett were awfully distracting. However, the make-up and special visual effects on Bella's look during the pregnancy were realistically eerie. Jacob's imprinting scene was also well-executed.Kristin Stewart was as bland as ever as Bella. Robert Pattinson was as cheesy as ever as Edward. Taylor Lautner does a bit better as Jacob, maybe because of how nobly his character had been written. Most of the other supporting characters, human, vampire and werewolf get a line or two. Memorable one-liners from Billy Burke as Bella's dad Charlie, and Anna Kendrick as Bella's friend Jessica before and during the wedding, made me laugh out loud.This movie is strictly for the entertainment of Twilight fans who will love it. It is up to par and keeps the spirit well with the rest of the other Twilight films. For non-Twilight fans who haven't read the book though, at least this installment does manage to keep your interest. I have no idea what else is left for Part 2 to tell. It felt like they could have ended the franchise with this one already since the love story seems to have been settled, if not only for financial considerations. My wife will see this whole film differently though. Hehe.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not as bad as I thought, but really saying absolutely nothing","I really wanted to see this movie so as to be able to make fun of it in full knowledge. And I really expected something awful. The thing is, it wasn't that bad. The actors were OK, the effects were OK, the production values were OK. Nothing above average, but certainly not something terrible. The only problem with the film that I could not get over was the story. It said absolutely nothing! A lot of young people talk about their feelings, prepare for The Breaking Dawn part 2, then the film ends.So yeah, it is a pretty crappy feeling to wait an hour and a half for something to happen, then a woman gives birth in a creepy way (don't they all?) and the film ends with nothing to show for the lost time. And, as a spoiler, I did watch part 2 immediately afterwards and almost all of it was just the same. So, in my view, this is a single film with about two hours and a half of nothing, then some special effects, and then, again, a completely boring ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

still some boring parts but moves slowly to darker regions,"Twilight, you love it or you hate it and I'm one that hate it. But I must say that this time I enjoyed some parts. Still, it do has a few boring parts.I was happy that the glistening vampire was gone and that we really had a vampire this time to see. the part I enjoyed was when Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) had a dream of her wedding where they killed everybody. it looked so great and I was surprised by the amount of red stuff they used. On the other hand it's still clear to see that it is a flick for youngsters. the romantic scene in the water and after wards in bed were Bella is fully naked they really edited in that way that nothing was seen of her private parts and juggs. Kristen admitted that the shooting did had a few nudity shots but that the producers and director thought that it would be shocking and they wouldn't get their toddler rating. A bit the same what happened with Jennifer's Body (2009) where Megan Fox comes topless out of the water. But that's another story.Once Bella becomes pregnant the movie becomes a bit enjoyable to watch and the boring situations and blah blah between Bella and Edward are on a hold. Jacob Black also has an important role and leaves his shirt on this time. Maybe they all have learned there lessons due spoofs and reviewers laughing with Twilight.I do must give kudos to the special effects and in fact the part make-up where they transferred Bella into a sick and almost death person. She's skinny too (easy to spot in her bikini) which adds towards the looks of a sick person.Naturally, all is predictable (no pun intended) and no surprises are to expect from this part. The end shot of Bella was one you could see coming miles away but please do watch the end credits when suddenly the Volturis are back into the game. They are the best looking vampires in Twilight. again, easy to spot what they are going to say.Overall, it is still Twilight but like Harry Potter they are moving very slowly to darker regions.Gore 1,5/5 Nudity 0,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The most grown up of the bunch.,"Even for those of you who flat out just don't like the Twilight franchise, this will be your highest rated of all 4 films. I've read the books which are vastly superior to the films, but so far I've enjoyed this one the most. You can tell the direction is much more sophisticated than in prior films. The original was my favorite until I saw BD, but I always thought they leaned towards teenage cheese fest. Breaking Dawn breaks away from the pack in what would still be a pretty decent film on it's own. Mind you it will never win any awards, but it's noticeably improved in direction, pacing, and yes acting.Taylor Lautner is still as bad as ever, and the other 90% of the cast have minimal lines and opportunities to show off their abilities. And while Kristen Stewart is a decent actress in her other films, she's always been dreadfully bad in the Twilight franchise. But alas she was not altogether terrible in this one. I've had the chance to see Robert Pattinson in two other films, and he's a much better actor than the Twilight franchise gives him credit for. Given the chance he can come up with some pretty powerful stuff.Aside from all that, the writers and director have really brought the film up to a higher level, relatively speaking. The pacing is a thousand times better than previous films. It just seems more organic than all the others. I can't say I enjoyed New Moon, Eclipse was just OK, and I did enjoy Twilight. BD surpasses all of them by far.Bottom line, if you're not a fan you're not going to enjoy this just like you didn't enjoy any of the others.

"Awful, boring, nonsense","I never normally write reviews, but this film was so terrible that I need it brought to justice.I have wanted to watch the Twilight Saga for a while, but never been able to bring myself to do it in fear of the embarrassment that would come with discussing it amongst friends.I'm obviously not the target demographic for these films and never went into this challenge expecting them to be good. However, this film might unironically be the worst movie I have ever seen. The pacing is horrendous, acting more like a filler episode of a T.V series. The dialogue, especially the romantic dialogue, is unrealistic, over the top and shallow given how the main relationship falls flat.The movie also had some strange subtext that felt very pro-life / anti-abortion. I cannot prove this is what the writer intended, but they use telepathy to 'communicate' with the fetus and intentionally show how it has feelings and emotion. Very creepy, strange writing decision.The only potentially good scene in the whole film is when the wolf pack are meeting and it is ruined by catastrophically implemented ADR which just makes the whole thing confusing to watch.The character building in this franchise is poor, but this film takes the cake for inconsistencies. One character seems to have a completely different mindset from the previous film and decides to stick with Bella even though he wanted to kill her a few scenes before? They explain it away with a gimmic called imprinting, which is also another creepy aspect of this film.I have just watched the film and I already cannot recall how they managed to fill two hours.

Painfully bad,"None of the Twilight films are particularly good, which makes it all the more impressive that this is by far and away the worst of the bunch.Despite making financial sense, it is always a risk from a narrative perspective to split one book into two films. The first film can too easily feel like a slow first act of the second film and be devoid of any propulsion or substantial plot. Unfortunately this is the fate that befalls Breaking Dawn Part 1.Although a very substantial event in the franchise takes place, it is dragged on for so long that the whole thing just feels excruciatingly slow. It really makes the whole film feel redundant, and like it could have just been condensed into 30 minutes of one longer film overall.Of course all the other trademarks of the Twilight franchise are still present.

why was the final book made into two movies....,"hardly anything happens in this. So much of the honeymoon could have been shortened to make the final book one movie. Of course, I know it was for the mighty dollar, but can the people whom make these movies at least try to put out a good product.The first 40 minutes is the wedding and Jacob upset about it. Then the next third is Bella and Edward on their honeymoon in Brazil and the unnatural fetus. Then the last third is them back home and Bella is very sickly because the baby is killing her. And the wolves want the baby dead because it could be a danger to them. But they can't kill Bella while she is still human. And Jacob decides he would rather turn on his kind and do what he can to protect Bella.And this is all the happens besides the very end where we have the birth. The whole book could have been made in a 2 and half hour movie with the birth happening half way through.FINAL VERDICT: I just don't get the popularity of these movies.

'Breaking Dawn' Is Breathtaking. Twi-Hards Will Be In Heaven ‚Äî REVIEW,"From the moment that Jacob freaks when he receives Bella's wedding invitation, to the very last frame of 'Breaking Dawn', the 5 star film is like a magnificent tasty feast that you won't want to ever end. Breaking Dawn fans‚Äìyou will NOT be disappointed. Director Bill Condon has worked hard to capture the breadth of the action and emotion in Stephanie Meyer's last Twilight novel.Thank goodness, the powers-to-be at Summit Entertainment which produces the Twilight series, made the decision to break Breaking Dawn into two films. There's no way you could have packed all the action in the last book into one movie.Even so, Breaking Dawn Part I could have been 15 or 20 minutes longer, to my mind, to have had enough time to luxuriously dwell on all the significant moments and life events that it covers.Kristen Stewart perfectly captures Bella's apprehension as she's about to walk down the aisle at her wedding. And the wedding scene is so lush, romantic and heartfelt as Edward and Bella whisper their vows‚ÄìI just wanted it to go on and on and on.Now‚Äìthe gown. It will not be a letdown. I don't want to reveal too much but it manages to be very Bella‚Äìnot overdone‚Äìand yet it is stunningly and elegantly fitted (Kristen has said that it was tight), with elegantly figure-highlighting details.Will Bella's gown be as widely copied as Kate Middleton's? It will come close. It's design will certainly flatter many young women.But back to the lavishly romantic wedding‚Äìcreatively designed by Alice Cullen. My only criticism is that we all could have spent even more time at that wedding, honing in on meeting the visiting vampire contingents, checking in with Bella and Edward's baffled schoolmates and on Bella's nervous parents.Then Bella and Edward take us along on the honeymoon that is every bit as exotic and luxurious as Stephenie Meyer paints it. Is the highly written about and hotly discussed sex scene as erotic as Robert Pattinson has told us it would be ?I'll leave it to you to decide but there's no question about the sizzling sexual tension and chemistry between Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson. The two are always totally believable as the star-crossed lovers who pledge to be together for eternity.What you'll probably be surprised by is the unexpected humor that pops up from time to time in this epic film. And we get some of it endearingly during Bella and Edward's Brazilian honeymoon heaven.But it's when Bella's pregnancy kicks in (literally) that the film really takes off. That's because Jacob a.k.a. Taylor Lautner comes back into the picture along with all his tortured love triangle tension.Other ""film"" critics ‚Äì boo on you ‚Äì I don't agree with the fine cinematic reviewers who deride Taylor as just a fabulous chest, strong jaw, and handsome face.Yes, he is all those but his character‚Äìa 16-year-old young man/wolf struggling to adjust to his werewolf fate ‚Äì isn't supposed to be a chatty self-expressive New York dude like Jonah Hill.No, he's supposed to be a tongue-tied semi-lost soul who loves Bella like a soul mate, and doesn't know how to express himself most of the time, except for physically. Not too unlike many 16-year-old boys.But once Bella and Edward are back from their honeymoon and she is clinging to life while trying to gestate her baby, the tension is intense.Tension between Bella and Edward, Bella and Jacob, and Jacob and the entire wolf pack.A lot of attention has been paid to Bella's wedding hair and makeup but Bella as a vampire mama is a pretty intense makeup job itself . And acting job.Kristen Stewart, to her credit, is completely believable as a weak Bella desperately holding on to life for the love of her baby.As promised ‚Äì the birth scene is wild, shocking, and yes, quite bloody.And there's no way that any Twi-hard isn't going to be left desperately wanting to see Breaking Dawn Part 2.But let me tell you ‚Äì stick around for the credits. There's a surprise last scene. There's also a wedding surprise bonus that I won't detail, but you will go WILD!My only real criticism is that I wanted more werewolves. We don't watching the film, get as deep an understanding of the communication, hierarchy, and pack lives of the wolves. Neither do we understand enough why Bella's pregnancy becomes such a HUGE issue for the pack.Every fan who has read the books will know what is going on and I understand Bill Condon's need for shorthand on the wolves‚Äìsomething had to go. But the wolves created for the screen are so magnificent and mysterious‚ÄìI wanted to see them more and have their behavior and history explained. Maybe Condon will get to that in Breaking Dawn Part 2.So Twi-fans‚Äìsnap up your tickets and head to the theaters‚Äìthere's no way you won't want to see this film more than once¬Öor twice! I do!Hollywoodlife by bonnie",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than expected.,"Better than expected. The acting has improved and so has the intensity and the storyline. Was much expecting more action but it was fine. It was also great to see wolf telepathy and more dialogue and screening time from the wolf-pack and other cullens. the directing and pacing was alright, but it got a little bit boring and slow during the first half of the movie. There could've been much more execution from Jacob but all in all, it was a good try. Condon did a great work, much better than previous directions. I didn't expect much - but the movie did exceed my expectations - so 7/10. Will be expecting the 2nd installment. This is coming from a 13 year old.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A borefest,"Maybe the worst of the franchise. Without too many technically poorly done scenes, but at the same time, with too many scenes where nothings happens.Of the little plot there actually is, its development is tv cable television quality level. Melodramatic and with superficial writing, only relevant and with tension for the ultra fans. The rest of us only see characters worried, annoyed, angry or sad, but without doing anything.When there is tension, is absolutely forced by script conveniences, with sudden needs from characters out of nowhere, and wasting opportunities for real tension (that would've required attentive and smarter writing).To end this, the CGI was atrocious, the worst in the saga, and the score was good for the first time in the franchise. About the acting, is hard to blame the performers, considering what it was giving to them. They tried.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exciting and Enthralling: A Review From a Non-Fan,"I hadn't seen any of the Twilight movies before a few months ago, only watched the first and some of the second. Thought the first was okay, kinda annoying at times, and a little weird. The second was boring, flat out.Breaking Dawn is like neither in those ways. It is tense, emotional, and enthralling to watch with a crowd full of eager fans.There are definite throwbacks to the first movie which fans will (and do) appreciate, there are little Easter eggs which they'll pick up on immediately, but that's not what this review is about. This is a review for the common movie-goer who's only ever heard the hype or the hate about this series. I'm here to tell you, Bill Condon has made a fun and exciting movie that is worth your admission, regardless of your feelings on the rest of the series.The first thing to note is that the acting, dialogue, and editing are all far, FAR superior to the original three. In short, this is due to Bill's team and the effort he puts into making the best movie he possibly can. Beyond that, the production value shows in the effects and in the staging of certain shots (one of which is in the trailers as Edward catches Bella's head before it hits the ground). This is a professional, crisp-looking movie that still manages to channel the style of the first Twilight.Now, I won't say this movie is ""one of the greatest ever"" because that's just nonsense. But as far as romance or popcorn flicks go, this is a great, emotional movie and is well worth your viewing. The wolf scenes are all exciting and awe-inspiring, particularly the first one, which sent chills up and down my spine for a solid 30 seconds.The humor in the movie is also very well done, and every line and beat gets its laughs. Our audience was loving it, especially a reference to a particular piece of art in the Cullen's house.The best thing I can say is that when the emotional moments come in this movie, they deliver in spades and leave you feeling it. This is due in no small part to the excellent score, written by Carter Burwell. The wedding scene was incredibly touching and so very well done, from start to finish. It may be the best scene in the movie (and this is from a 20- something male who doesn't really buy into the wedding/romance stuff). It is touching, romantic, humorous, all at exactly the right times in exactly the right way.I do not fit the demographic for this series, and I'll probably never see the second or third Twilight movies in completion, but Breaking Dawn Part 1 was the most fun I've had watching a movie in a theater. Period. The energy in that room was incredible to feel, and just seeing and hearing all those people who were so into everything on the screen was enough to make me smile, much less to know that with every passing frame they were having everything they hoped for delivered, and then some. Congrats to Bill and the team, the fans will adore you, and maybe you'll even get a few converts to the series. You've got one in me.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Keep an open mind,"Wow, people keep bashing this movie but all of these people who ""hated"" this movie still went to see it. Many people, including myself have read these books and were incredibly unhappy with the ending, but I still went to see it, because I loved the way the series started and I wanted to see it end.Okay, so the end of the movie is pretty gruesome. I don't care what the rating is, DO NOT BRING SMALL children to this movie. There were a few small children behind me sobbing in confusion as *SPOILER BUT REALLY EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT THIS* Edward bite baby Renesme out of Bella's stomach and then the camera pans out to show her lifeless and bloodied body. I could have probably done with out that graphic little image. But the wedding scene was beautiful and Charlie, arguable my favorite character, is adorable.Finally *ONCE AGAIN SPOILER, BUT YOU KNEW IT WAS COMING* at the end of the movie Jacob imprints on the baby and they did a good job of making bearable-because that has got to be the most awkward part of the whole book.Sigh, hm after saying all that I still stand by my rating of 7 stars.

It seems as though nobody involved in this franchise has the capability to learn from their mistakes,"I think that everybody will agree with me here when i say that the Bella & Edward romance in Twilight is one of the worst, wooden & totally unconvincing romances ever filmed in the history of world cinema. But unfortunately not the writers or the director seems to understand this and thus what we have here is a film that probably uses up about 60% of its time with a ridiculous and often times unintentionally hilarious romance.Eclipse was still pretty bad, but it was a step in the right direction for the franchise, as the focus seemed to be a bit more off of their worthless romance story and more on the actually interesting story about the newborns. Unfortunately, Breaking Dawn basically manages to fall into the same depths the first two fell in. We have a long drawn out half hour long wedding scene as if they thought they could pull off a 'The Godfather' or a 'The Deer Hunter' scene ( I apologise for naming these two actually GOOD movies in the same sentence as Twilight ). At the start you can see Kristen Stewart actively trying to pull off a happy face and you can frequently see her smiling ( Don't worry, her sighing, head shaking and eye contact evasing is still there ) which was already an extreme surprise to me, even though it was mostly just her lips moving and not much else. However, this was only limited to the start since after that her infamous legendary wooden facial expressions return. Ofcourse it doesn't help during the wedding scene that none of the characters there, or in the whole universe of Twilight for that matter are even slightly interesting.The honeymoon sequence consists of wholly Bella & Edward romance scenes and these 20-30 minutes have to be some of the worst ever filmed. We know their romance is terrible, unconvincing and ridiculous due to the fact that both of them are unable to act and unable to express sincere human emotions ( Especially Bella obviously ). Bella can be heard saying, and i quote: 'Why can't you see how perfectly happy i am???' Gee, Bella, i wonder why, could it be because you are just totally unable of conveying emotions in every way when you come onto the screen? The cinematography in these scenes was alright though, i'll give it that, but if you cannot combine cinematography with a story or great characters you might as well be watching an environmental documentary instead of a film.The final hour of the film might have been interesting, if we as the audience were actually given a single reason to care about what happens to any of the characters in this film. And why oh why would Jacob and Edward seriously fight over a wooden plank who is unable to comfortly gesture even the simplest human emotions. We are never given a single reason as to why the men in this film are attracted to Bella, other than dumb statements such as Edward saying during the wedding that she is 'someone you can bare your soul to, and who accepts you as you are', yeah right. Name me one person who couldn't come up with this blatantly obvious clich√© nonsensical reason and color me surprised.I should also mention that there is a scene in which a bunch of CGI wolves start talking amongst themselves, since that scene is so ridiculous it deserves a little rant of its own. At first i thought the Quilletes could only talk in human form, but it seems as though i was wrong, and what a mistake this turned out to be. Their mouths don't move, so where is the sound even coming from? It is even supposed to be an important scene about standing up for yourself, but it is disguised in so much ridiculous CGI that it is actually just comic gold. I have no qualms with certain things being CGI ( Even though the CGI wolves were terrible ), but such a ridiculous attempt of conveying emotion in a scene cannot be told in such a complete CGI fest where not even one actual human being is visible.It seems as though the writers and the director didn't learn from their mistakes, and kept the focus on Bella & Edward's terrible romance for far too long. The second half of the film might be slightly more interesting, but it is still as terrible cinema can get. It does have some certain good musical scores and cinematography, but in context of this film this cannot possibly even slightly save the failure it has become.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

As bad as it gets,"I knew I had to see this movie sometime especially after the lengthy review that Doug Walker gave it and how much he hated it. This is a guy who loved the other movies because of how bad they were. I specifically downloaded the Rifftrax file for this movie as a free sample and I was devastated to find out that the website has apparently changed and all my history was deleted so I had to buy the file for this movie. It was money well spent because I would have gone nuts if not for the file. This movie is amazingly boring and stupid in nearly every sense of the word.I actually looked up critical reviews and I think even people who were fans of the other movies hated this one. I guess I will give those other movies credit for being better. This movie features Edward and Bella getting married. Bella gets pregnant and most of this movie is just them talking about whether she should have an abortion. Okay they don't use the word ""abortion"" but it's what they're talking about. This is just a nasty unpleasant movie for me because everyone in this film is just so mean. Everybody is telling Bella to get rid of her fetus because it's killing her. This is just an uncomfortable movie with how they show Bella slowly get sicker because this vampire fetus is sucking the life out of her.Everybody just wants this fetus dead. I mean they really do use words like ""that thing"", ""bloodsucker"" and ""demon"" when describing a fetus. I don't see how anyone can defend such a mean spirited message. They call the fetus ""it"" over and over. This film is just depressing with how bitter everyone is. It just gets worse as time goes on. I am so glad this is the last ""Twilight"" movie I'll ever watch in my life. Apparently, there has somehow never been a vampire that's gotten a human pregnant before. During sex, Edward is literally destroying the beds and giving Bella bruises, which she's mostly okay with.The Rifftrax had tons of great stuff and I especially like, ""Oh honey, everyone's gone! Our unholy marriage must have triggered the rapture!"". I also loved when they referred to Jacob and said, ""Hi, runner up!"". I got a chuckle out of, ""I drink your bloodshake!"" too. Okay, did they really have to make a joke about bronies? I mean, I'm glad they acknowledge them, but don't say anything bad about us. I think this is the first time I've heard them riff through the credits, although they do stop at some point. Anywho, this is a trashy movie no one should watch. *",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An unexpectedly strong realization of troubled source material,"Forgive me for going on a slight tangent, but supporting cast member Billy Burke, and his character, Charlie, are the unsung heroes of the 'Twilight' franchise. Yes, Charlie is a cop, which grants him no favor - but more than that, he is a father who is trying and struggling to understand and do right by his daughter. His daughter, who in his own words has put him ""through hell,"" more than once, in a span of time that can be measured more easily in months than years. His daughter, who while still in high school, had become deeply involved in a romantic relationship that is the source of that hell. His daughter, who mere months after graduating from high school, is getting married. Now, I'm not exactly hip to social norms, and I certainly understand that even preteen children are perfectly capable of knowing and understanding who they are, and what they want and need from life, let alone teenagers. But it is still rather suspect, bordering on problematic, for Bella Swan and Edward Cullen to have a relationship of the nature that they do at their respective ages. And through it all, Charlie tries to do right. And Burke, bless his heart, gives a very strong performance of nuance and poise in each and every film, even only in a supporting part, as a man who is tired, concerned, and loves his daughter, and is trying to keep her safe, but also doesn't want to get in the way of her happiness.Welcome to 'The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part 1.'There's a LOT to unpack in these movies. The central relationship, questionable as it is in some ways, isn't even the worst of it, as everything about the werewolves is profoundly troubling as it presents. And the movies, with screenplays adapted by Melissa Rosenberg, are an improvement on Stephanie Meyer's novels - which I freely admit I have not read, but I'm well aware of some of the content therein, and some of the differences between paper and celluloid. And with 'Breaking dawn, Part 1' representing the beginning of the narrative climax of the saga, all the deeper problems of 'Twilight,' that cannot be ignored and must be discussed, somewhat come to a head.But more on that in a moment. This fourth feature opens with a wedding that is genuinely beautiful - and a reception that is pointedly awkward, to the point of inspiring soft laughter. Just as the third film was an unmistakable step up from its predecessors, we immediately get a sense of how much care was taken to ensure that 'Breaking dawn, Part 1' could be as robust in every way that it could be. It's technically flawless, and all the rounding details are impeccable and fetching - filming locations, art direction, production design. The costume design is a minor delight, and the hair and makeup work that was frankly over the top in 'Twilight' and 'New moon,' and noticeably toned down in 'Eclipse,' once again appears balanced and natural here. Moreover, as the story progresses and Bella's conditions shifts, I can only give kudos to the makeup department, and those behind visual effects, for bringing those changes to life. While the material screenwriter Rosenberg is working with has more issues than can be cited within any character limit, she once again illustrates her skill and dexterity with a screenplay that makes the most of the source. Dialogue, characterizations, scene writing, and the narrative at large seem as real, earnest, and engaging as they could be.With all due sincerity, it's a good thing that Rosenberg has been a consistent tent pole of the series, and that she shows such abilities as a writer. Because the young adult, supernatural romance culminates with a plot line, and a thread of story beats, that feels like a mixture of Lifetime melodrama, Nicholas Sparks tragic love, shades of sunny romantic comedies, and... a certain Pixar movie that involves collared dogs communicating in English. Any viewer who isn't receptive to the odd swirl of flavors that all this portends is in for a very rough ride - and even for those who are, 'Breaking Dawn, Part 1' is absolutely an oddity that requires fastidious, active, open-minded patience. Vampirism, the politics of the night, and the strains of conflict or action that filled much of the prior three films all take a distant backseat to a tale that overflows with tastes of pure ""human"" drama significantly unlike what the saga has served up previously. Those additional flourishes that we do get, small as they are, are done well, but are substantially downplayed by comparison.I say this as someone who, sights unseen, has been highly skeptical and distrusting of the 'Twilight' saga, and everything I'd heard about it, from the time the movies first came out: Despite the sharp sea change in the narrative, I think 'Breaking Dawn, Part 1' is written and executed as the best possible interpretation of Meyer's novel. For all the strangeness of the amalgamation before us, departing from three preceding features, I think veteran director Bill Condon shows his expertise with a keen eye for arranging shots and scenes. And I legitimately have no criticism to level at the cast - I think the performances here are very strong. I think, 11 years later, all the negativity surrounding the actors involved is unfair and inaccurate, a reflection instead of mostly mindlessly poo-poohing anything targeted toward teen girls and young women, and pointlessly mocking the very notion of the story without true consideration of its content, or how it is conveyed. I have seen and know what the ensemble is capable of, before and since and elsewhere, and they are good actors. And I believe they show it here, too. Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, and the large supporting cast exhibit range, nuance, strength and force of personality, and physicality matching the needs of the story, but also indicating that they deserve much more and better things to come their way. For that matter - Taylor Lautner gave a sorry display of acting in 'New moon' that was one of that feature's noteworthy weaknesses. Yet while he's probably the weakest link in 'Breaking dawn, Part 1,' I also believe Lautner manages to show growth as an actor that I can't help but commend.None of this is to say this fourth 'Twilight' movie is perfect, because it absolutely is not. There are issues here. Foremost among them - returning to the matter of murky source material that needs to be critically assessed - is the notion of ""imprinting."" True, from what I understand, the concept is handled even more poorly in Meyer's books, with it being all but plainly stated that imprinting involves the loss of autonomy and will for the one experiencing it - and the erasure of independence and separate identity, for the one who is the subject of it, usually women. And yet imprinting also factors into the movies as a major story beat, in the most bewildering, problematic, and outright predatory fashion, with the sudden insertion of a new character relationship that is inappropriate in too many ways to recount at once. Again, I think screenwriter Rosenberg, director Condon, and all others involved made the best film they could - but a masterpiece of a statue, sculpted from a sewage treatment plant, is still a statue made of... Well. And there's no getting around the huge eyesore that's a big part of the tale here.Even putting that aside - small as the scope of the overall saga is, there is an unexpected variety of moods, tones, flavors, and story ideas wrapped up in it. And for all the attentiveness with which the narrative has been treated in adaptation, there's still so much to communicate to make it complete that the whole can never feel absolutely, 100% balanced between all its constituent parts. The fact that Meyer's fourth book was split into two feature films rather emphasizes that point, I think, with 'Part 1' focusing on the ""human drama,"" and with a promise that 'Part 2' will return to the core concepts of the series. At risk of repeating myself: I appreciate the work Rosenberg put into her screenplays. She did the very best she could have, in my opinion.And, as one last personal gripe - the last anticipated sound cue we get before credits start rolling is utterly unnecessary. Why couldn't we just have had a silent image? I think that would have been more impactful.With all this having been said, I still maintain that while deviating from its antecedents, and borne from source material with deep issues, 'Breaking Dawn - Part 1' is a strong realization of that material. Every component part, writing and acting included, is solid. It's the fine details that once again wear down the possibilities of what the title could have been, but even with all its faults, I'm surprised to find myself thinking it's much better than I was ever (mis)led to assume. It's a rather limited, cinematically curious audience who will most find favor here, and I can understand the lower opinions of those who meaningfully engage with the picture and walk away dissatisfied. Yet for all the skepticism and cynicism I carried as I began watching, I can't help but be a little bit impressed with what cast and crew alike managed to pull off here. 'Breaking dawn, Part 1' is not essential, but it's also a film that deserves honest, thoughtful consideration, flaws and all. And that itself is more than I ever thought, 11 years ago, I could have ever said of it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Inconvenience of Vampire Nookie,"For those not familiar with the rules of the Official Twilight drinking game they are as follows.Take a shot/sip when... 1. Someone says the word vampire or wolf or any variation including ""newborns"". 2. Whenever someone sparkles. 3. When the father appears in police uniform. 4. Whenever someone is brooding. 5. Whenever an obnoxious hipster indie song is being played in the background. 6. Whenever someone doesn't have his shirt on. 7. Whenever someone gives an unrealistically generous gift, does a foolishly gallant act or otherwise bends the rules of common sense for Bella.Drink the rest of the bottle when... 1. Someone unattractive or out of shape is on screen. 2. Something in a scene makes you feel anything other than sleepiness or the need to plant your face in your hands.Thus I delved into the world of Breaking Dawn Part 1. In this film, Edward and Bella take the plunge so she can become a vampire like she's always wanted. Jacob pisses and moans, and Bella has unprotected sex while still human resulting in her mutant baby trying to eat its way out of her womb. You know, true love and all that good stuff.My roommate, whose expertise on Twilight I value as much as one reasonably can, filled in some of the holes that went unexplained or glossed over in the flick. Why can't they just turn her into a vampire while pregnant? Because it would kill the baby. Why is the act of sex with a vampire while human potentially deadly? Because their skins as hard as diamonds and they're super strong. How can these vampires live for eons amassing enough money to afford a private island off the coast of Brazil without the IRS at least knowing about it? And for that matter why would vampires want a vacation home in sunny Rio anyway? Just shut up and watch the movie!My roommate did bring up an interesting notion that was not explained in the movie nor, she believes, explained in the book. How can they even have sex? Vampires have no pulse so they have no blood actually coursing through their veins. It only stands to reason that Edward can't get his little Dracula to stand at attention. So Bella is waiting to be turned, just so she can have human carnal knowledge of a cold corpse with a flaccid iditarod. Perhaps if you're being turned into a bloodsucker while you're performing (its been known to happen in vampire movies) then you'd have a fully erect projectile for always and forever but that would be a very inconvenient case of rigamortis. You'd never be able to wear mesh shorts, birds would always want to perch on you and all your vampire friends would always call you Vlad the Impaler. But on the positive side you'd actually achieve every pubescent boy's deep seeded fantasy; you could use you're dingus as a weapon!Of course its all fun and games until someone gets pregnant. That's why its important kids, to make and keep important commitments to your loved ones. In this case, commit to spending the rest of eternity with a manipulative Gothic horror monster before getting jiggy with it or else be forced to drink O- slurpees while your ribcage and spine breaks from the force of your bloodthirsty monster child. By the way, the baby's name is Renesmee a mix of Bella's mother's name and the punchline of a cruel practical joke. The newborn is also imprinted by Jacob which is a way for a werewolf to leave his marking that disappointingly doesn't involve rising his hind legs.In the end, Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a vapid, stupid, glacierly paced movie with very little going for it other than the welcome sight of Bella withering away. So its a substantial improvement from the rest of the series. I actually look forward to the next and hopefully final chapter in the franchise. Maybe if I get liquored up before the premiere (or during), I would only remember the good parts, like the credits.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's not all bad....,"I was half looking forward and half not looking forward to seeing this film. After New Moon I was skeptical. But Breaking Dawn was the best book out of the saga. So I went with an open mind. Honestly I wouldn't have gone to see it only my friend is a total ""Twi-hard"". Its starts off with Jacob receiving an invitation to Bella and Edward's wedding,this angers him and he runs off into the forest. The wedding itself,I have to admit, was beautiful.Then the happily married couple set off for the honeymoon and they have a lovely,romantic time.Then it all goes pear-shaped. The good points of this film were as follows: The soundtrack was very good and suited the atmosphere totally.The scenery was breathtaking. Now for the bad points:I don't care what anyone says neither Kristen Stewart nor Robert Pattinson can act.Not many of the cast can.Also it was cheesy in parts.Many parts.Still overall it certainly was not the worst of the saga and it is not the best. If you're not an absolute fan of it then you're not going to enjoy it.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Review From A Male Perspective,"I rated this movie as a seven and feel that it is watchable for most men. The movie starts off very slowly, with lame jokes and a less than romantic wedding scene, but what else can you expect from a film that has a largely teenaged fan base? It does manage to pick up once the story shifts locations and has a decent amount of drama that will at least keep most men awake to follow the storyline. More importantly, the story ends with a great buildup to the final movie.For more on why I rated this a 7, you can see and hear my comments (which include spoilers) in the link below: http://www.spreecast.com/events/easymactwilight",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'll be the one in white,"This is probably the best quality Twilight film so far...and I still found it pretty funny so...favourite I guess?If you couldn't guess, it's not amazing, but there were a grand total of two scenes that stood out to me as fairly well directed, which is more than I can say for any other film in this bloody series.Still though, the acting is terrible, there's little to no chemistry between any of the characters, and to be fair, if you're an actual fan of this series, I could understand it being your least favourite, because not a lot happens. Definitely feels like a Part 1 film.But holy dear god, if you didn't think Jacob was creepy enough already...the ending of this one is something else. And...this might be a pro-life film? Maybe? I mean if it is...ew, but you know what I mean if you've seen it.And the writing and dialogue is just as amazingly hilarious as ever, so I wasn't left disappointed even if not a lot happens in this one.My one hope for Breaking Dawn Part 2...please let Aro continue to be the best character.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fire the Damn Hairdresser!!,"I had SUCH a hard time enjoying the movie because of the awful styling!! Vampire hair does not grow ( Emmet's Fro ) and I am almost positive that somewhere in the books it said that it was strong enough to cut something (so shouldn't be able to be cut). Carlisle looked like a Dork and how did Rosalie go from being really blonde (Eclipse) to having almost brown dirty mop water blonde colored hair, and Esme from Auburn to black?!?! It really ruined it for me............Other than that the movie was pretty good. Kind of accurate to the book so that was nice.......... I just couldn't get over how bad the character's looked. Why change what everyone was in love with?? Doesn't make sense........ In the books Stephanie never writes that the characters have changed their appearances.......",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Entertaining and well directed,"This movie appears to be the victim of the ""hate Twilight mob"", which is a similar mob to the anti-X-Factor bunch (to which I belong) who will do and saying anything as long as it throws a negative view over it. The current IMDb of 4.0 (dated 19/11/11) is laughable and once again makes you question the credibility of the IMDb rating system. Anyway...I can understand why the Twihards like this but to be honest I thought the films leading up to this one were quite poor. Not very well made at all. OK to watch but not great examples of films as they should be. I have just watched Breaking Dawn Part 1 and I am happy to say that it is so much better. I am not a Twihard but I found this film well made, entertaining, enjoyable, pleasant on the eye and imaginative. OK OK, I don't want to exaggerate it, it is not Oscar material (apart from Bella's makeup), but it is a good film. I have rated it at 7.0 because I honestly believe that is what it truly deserves.Yes the story is nonsense, but come on, it is about vampires and werewolves. What do you honestly expect? But the director has done a very good job of translating the book to film (in my wires opinion).So let me break down my thoughts on it as I remember them....The film starts very fast. Slightly too fast. But I suppose there is a lot to cram in and before you know it we are into the wedding scene. The wedding is a good mixture of looking good, humour and drama. This flows into the honeymoon section where we were shown some lovely scenes. The romantic section was done very well and with taste. I personally thought the balance was just right here. Not too loaded with skin or uncomfortable holds etc..The honeymoon scene is where the main storyline is created. Everyone must know what happens here but I will not mention it. But the way it was introduced was good and the pace was just about right. This sections effectively puts Bella's makeup artist on the Oscar nominee list. Her gradual transformation is incredible. I assume it is all just makeup and lights...I couldn't see any clunky CGI. If it was CGI then they will no doubt get awards too. But the closing scenes with Bella have you seeing her in an amazing transformed state that simply makes the scenes what they are. Very impressed.The werewolves are considered the Marmite with this series of films. You either love or loathe the CGI. I have always accepted the CGI and bought into it and this film was no different. What I found better was the better direction and introduction of better mood music. The section on the log beach should have been stupid but I found it very powerful. More credit to the director.So what stood out that I didn't like? The lack of continuity in the whiteness of the faces kept grabbing my attention. Very minor though. The thing that I really didn't like was the CGI on the baby's face. It just appeared to be a little clumsy and obvious. But this was only for a nano-second so I may be judging harshly. But it could have been better.Rather than waffle on, I hate long reviews, I will sum it up. The film starts fast. The story represents the book very well. The direction is good and the makeup is excellent. The build up to the climax is well balanced and the film went very fast (despite its long running time). The way this film ends is spot on and does leave you wanting to know what happens next. I enjoy watching good films and I know what is rubbish when I see it. But I can safely recommend this film to you with the only caveat of ""remember what you are going to see"" before you rush in and judge it harshly. I recall all the rubbish that has been pumped out this year and this is not part of that. This film entertains..as simple as that!ps: Don't leave when the scene closes at the end...there is more after the credits!!! So many walked out thinking it was finished...Doh!!!Hope you enjoy the film folks :)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Horrible, Complete waste of time & $$$$$","This movie was awful. I have seen some bad movies in my time, but this one was just simply pointless and a complete waste. They wanted more $$$$ that is the only explanation and reason I can gather for even making a ""2 part"" finale!!!! The movie was drawn out, slow and I mean SLOW, and they just over dramatized every tiny pointless tidbit that they could to simply get 110 minutes worth of film for us to suffer through. I would venture to guess there is MAYBE 5 minutes of actual action in this film, 5 minutes. This movie should have concluded with the final chapter and the first part could of been summed up in 20 minutes and moved on to the final conclusion of what part 2 is suppose to bring us. For many movie goers and fans of Twilight I would assume this is a major disappointment and the fact that it comes on the heels of the conclusion to the series could be a potential disaster to the franchise as many fans may be tempted to give up on this now after this part 1 misery! I applaud the directors and producers and creators of this filth for single handedly destroying all promise and potential and excitement to Twilight series. Harry Potter final 2 part movie had a purpose and flare & substance and kept you on edge and intrigued. This first part left you angry and frustrated and annoyed and hopeless and with out a doubt wanting your $$$$$ returned to you!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome Movie,Awesome. I just watched it a few hours back.... Edward looks super handsome (as always)... the wedding and honeymoon scenes are mind-blowing..... the birth scene is so intense... the fight scenes b/w vampires and werewolves is cool too.... Wanna get a DVD asap... Cant wait for part-2. Stephanie Meyer is shown attending the wedding :) Bella's wedding dress is just so beautiful and all vampire girls look stunning.......... a lot new of new characters too.... Seth is cute... Alice looks very nice... so does Emmett and Jasper... The honeymoon is quite sexy.... Isle Esme is very beautiful in the movie..... A lot of things in the book are missing... but since a movie can only be 2 hours I guess thats fine...,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Breaking Dawn Part 1: Well-Made, Melodrammatic but Mature...","THE TWILIGHT SAGA: BREAKING DAWN PART 1 (EXTENDED EDITION) Movie Review: ""After the successful third edition into the series, Eclipse; which has been received with better to positive reviews from major critics and appraisal from an estimated 83,693,746 fans, much expectation was directed towards Academy Award winning Bill Condon. This new director succeeds almost certainly but this soap-operatic film falls in some ways that made Eclipse such a guilty pleasure to watch."" The story continues with Bella Swan finally making the decision to marry and live eternally with her beloved Edward Cullen, with the disapproval of Jacob Black the buff childhood sweet heart, a werewolf as well, whom she dumps for because her love for Edward is unending even though he left her heart broken in New Moon, the second movie/book, causing her to become suicidal such as risking her life to see a faint image of Edward. Bella marries Edward, consumes a half-human, half-vampire child during their honeymoon, deteriorates slowly due to the rapid growth of the baby in which is tearing her apart inside, and the whole Cullen family has to worry about their shaky treaty with the werewolves, the Quileute tribe. All in all, the story sounds a bit more mature than the three previous films because more is at stake and the conflict is more grave than the decision between Bella's love over her two suitors. However, sadly, Breaking Dawn-Part 1 seems to be more in the same veins as New Moon. The film is directed better, the story is grim, the production designs are well made and the actors are marginally better than before, but why does it sometimes feel like a lackluster? The Actors: 1.0 credit They have been swooning and moody for the past three films, especially the central character Bella Swan. I like her character because she represents the average neighborhood girl. Her yearning in Twilight is understandable and relates to many. Her pain in New Moon is sometimes a bore but relatable. She gradually matures in Eclipse. Finally, in Breaking Dawn Part 1, she gets to play a deteriorated mother of an unknown child that could represent danger and the end to her life. The credit goes to Kristen Stewart. This is her better role so far as Bella Swan. We are able to feel her sense of determination and yet see her outward appearance which might shock some viewers. Her high cheek bones, her bony structure, her darken eyes, and her raspy-low voice. Thanks to the designers and visual effects. Edward and Jacob, both, act the usual with Edward moping voice and Jacob's cracked voice. The Visual Effects and Production Values: 1.0 credit Bella's body is something of a disgusting fascination, her performance also adds to the finishing touch; make up and computer detailing. The Wedding Scene in the beginning is well staged and beautifully mossy yet rich, over the top looking. The fight that ensues in the end is watchable but only shortly. Overall, this seems like an expensive soap opera movie. The Ending: 1.0 credit Gruesome Birth scene of a screaming Bella Swan only adds to the horror of what is happening below the stomach. In fact, Rosalie does a risky C-Section while Edward shoots morphine up her arms and legs. Blood is everywhere, which is a difficult situation especially delivering a half-vampire, half human baby in the company of vampires, and the audience can cringe to the sounds of bones crushing, heavy breathing and saliva spitting everywhere from Bella's mouth. We then see a dying Bella lying lifeless on the bed. The camera work and lighting are things that add up to the horror and terrifying 10 minutes experience of Bella giving birth and Edward trying to revive her. This is one of the better scenes I have ever seen in any movie so far about a female character trying to deliver a baby (besides Rosemary's Baby). The ending keeps you at the edge of your seat. Overall. 3/5 Breaking Dawn Part 1 is a better film; in the design, the visual effects, a bravura performance from Kristen Stewart and an engaging first and last 20 minutes. However, it still feels like a complete letdown from Eclipse; the performances from the other characters, the pacing is slow, and the dialogue still remains indifferent. Yet, I hope that the last part of this series will shoot me out with a bang",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
These vampires really DO suck!,"Have now watched breaking Dawn Pt 1 and can honestly say it is the biggest heap of sh*te ever! If I had paid money to see it, I would be going postal on everyone who conspired to take my money from me. It was absolutely awful! I only watched this because a) I'm a completist when it comes to all things vampire and I've read all the books (below mediocre) and watched the previous films, and b) I figured it couldn't get any worse than the last one. I was wrong. The series started poorly and went downhill fast. There are SO many things wrong with it that it would be impossible to list them all, but a couple are that the CGI wolves are even worse than the ones they had in The Day After Tomorrow (and they were bloody awful!), and there were several instances where vamps had sunlight shining directly on them and there were absolutely no sparkles (but then, I think VAMPIRES SHOULDN'T SPARKLE anyway). I could wax lyrical on the poor performances and go into detail about just how badly the scene where the wolves were all talking telepathically sucked, but I'd just bore everyone.The soundtrack to this one is pretty nothing-y as well. And the music is pretty much constant. It reminded me of when I tried to watch Twin Peaks, but couldn't because the constantly-present music was so loud I could hardly make out what the characters were saying. In this instance, I COULD hear what was being said, but the music playing ALL THE TIME was still very annoying. Sometimes there's a lot to be said for background SILENCE or just natural sound instead of music. I honestly cannot recall a single moment in that film where there wasn't music playing - it drove me absolutely nuts! It possibly doesn't help that the other film I watched last night (The Ides of March) was nothing short of brilliant and, in my opinion, a definite contender for several Oscar nominations, so BDP1 suffered even more in comparison. At least my whole evening wasn't a complete bust! I would have happily paid twice for The Ides of March - it's THAT good!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well Done Bill Condon!,"Bill Condon has managed, with Breaking Dawn Part 1, to do what directors of ""Twilight"" ""New Moon"" and ""Eclipse"" have failed to do... Stay true to the book! As a Twilight fan, I of course have seen all the previous movie's countless times, however each film seemed to be lacking something, and each time the credits rolled for each film I found myself wondering if, had I not read the books before hand, I would have understood the storyline the way I did. This was not so in Breaking Dawn Part 1.Like many other fans I do not mind admitting that I was extremely worried about seeing this film, I feared that the story would not be able to be portrayed well on screen and that key elements of the story would be omitted as they have been with previous films, for the simple reason that ""It was just too hard to show on screen"". But I needn't have worried Condon managed to do the story justice, with help of beyond excellent actors, extravagant special effects, and a script writer who definitely knows her audience.Condon had the hardest job of all the ""Twilight"" directors, and not just because of Breaking Dawn's tricky, and sometimes controversial storyline, but because he also had to clear up all the mistakes caused by the franchise's previous directors.So I say again... Well done Bill Condon!!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
You don't even have to see the movie to know what it's about,"It's the same movie all over again. The trailer was the only thing new, and that was basically the whole movie. Jacob takes off his shirt, with the same look on his face, the runs to Bella. Edward is basically a bad husband (And actor). Everyone thinks he just wants to protect Bella, but no, he just wants to control her. And Bella is the worst of them all, she's like a goth that can't act. This whole movie was just a bore, the trailer was the most action in the whole thing. I don't understand why people actually like this series. And my biggest thing about the movie is that, the were in the sun the whole time, but none of the vampires even minded. At least make one of them say ""Dang, it's hot out here"" or something. Plus, aren't they suppose to glisten when they are in the sun or something? Well guess what, that's a big flaw in the movie because they didn't. The biggest blood sucker of the series are the writers, because they managed to do the same movie in four different ways.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Narcissistic Powerlessness,"The vampire boy looks like a male prostitute and the werewolf boy looks like a victim of fetal alcohol syndrome. Yet these are the least shocking fantasies dwelling in the hearts of adolescent girls and women over 40.This is the second Twilight movie I have seen, and as far as I can tell, the heroine, Bella, has made no attempt to find an academic, artistic or athletic passion, nor has she attempted any other type of pursuit of achievement or learning. She appears to be somewhat petulant and extremely selfish, playing the vampire boy and the werewolf boy off against each other, and the two romantic rivals are too damn stupid to realize this.The vampires in these films are all frozen at approximately age 17 in physical appearance and emotional development. As far as I can tell, only one vampire has a job, yet somehow they have buttloads of money for trophy homes and private islands and private jets.At age 17, Bella is willing to become permanently stunted herself at her own narcissistic stage of development, becoming a vampire for all eternity on the basis of the mystique and male prostitute sexiness of the vampire boy.It's the height of romanticism in our culture to fantasize about 17 year girls who don't know any better irrevocably tying their fates to creepy immature older guys.Vampires and werewolves fight huge battles to protect Bella from either bad vampires or bad werewolves. Bella takes no action to help defend herself...she is an object to be revered and protected.Of course, this all culminates in Bella getting pregnant, because if the ideal of femininity is the elimination personal achievement and expression, than the crowning achievement of womanhood is to make babies...even if the baby is a bloodsucking demon spawn.The traditional adolescant protagonist in films and movies undergoes a conflict or has an adventure and along the way gains wisdom and maturity that will help the character make their way in the adult world...'Juno' and 'Rushmore' typify this concept. None of that in Twilight, that's for sure. Bella will remain twisted and stunted, just as the American imagination has been twisted and stunted by economic deterioration and religious authoritarianism.Besides being a major mind-rape for adolescents with any emotional vulnerabilities, parents should note that this film has a very graphic (and extremely bloody) c-section birth scene for Bella's Hellspawn bloodsucking demon vampire baby.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
How does one enjoy this?,"For another month in the fourth consecutive year the world is thrust into the dull world of Twilight, where some enjoy the eye candy, some are looking for a faithful adaptation of Stephanie Meyers' novels, and I'm thinking ""How on Earth does one describe these films as 'good'?""Yet again, I see no ultimate redeeming factor in this latest film of the series. The acting is better than ever, but that honestly does not say much when looking back at how bad the performances were in the predecessors. The second half of the film managed to hold my interest, but then I realized I was staring into a screen. The only real conflict is whether Bella is able to conceive her baby or not. Charming.Then there's the birth scene, which has gone through media magnification. It's not as bloodcurdling as it has stated to be in my opinion. Nor are the much-talked-about sex scenes.The undercurrent of the film continues to be the ""why it's important to have a boyfriend"" message which honestly cannot be cared for anymore, especially when it's in a story that struggles to identify with an audience - do any women out there have a vampire of a boyfriend, literally?I'm not saying that the vampire/human relationship makes for a pointless narrative, because we've witnessed the amount of conflict happened in the story over the past three films. On a further note - the conflict has happened very late into the films, since the plot is driven so damn slowly every time, taking an hour to fully settle and engage us spectators.Breaking Dawn Pt 1 is strictly for fans of the series who will enjoy it as much as they have enjoyed the last three films. I've never read the books but have read from sources that Melissa Rosenberg's screenplay faithfully adapts the first half of the novel onto the big screen, so there's a bonus for die-hard fans.It's obviously up to those who aren't fans to decide themselves if they wish to see it or not but take my word - ask yourselves, how do I enjoy a film about a woman getting married to a vampire and watch their life as a couple for the first hour, then attempt to enjoy the second hour where the thrill of the drama is centered on whether a woman can give birth or not?Extra note - I do admit that the last shot of the film is spectacular and creates many enigma's on what is to happen in part 2.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twilight series dims,"Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's not because I'm a Twilight hater. This is just awful. The first hour and 10 minutes was god awfully brutal to sit through. Some scenes were as disgusting as it can get on screen. This slow-moving film has long periods of inaction and generates no suspense and though sometimes unintentionally funny, when they make serious statements. Making it the worst film in the ""Twilight Saga"" films so far.Waiting for the damn wedding to start while director Bill Condon labours the point that Bella is nervous.Waiting for the reception to end while Condon labours the point that it's very awkward for everyone.Waiting for the happy couple to finally get their act together and have sex while Condon labours the point that Edward (Robert Pattinson) is scared of hurting Bella (Kristen Stewart).Waiting for a baby to be born while Condon labours the point that it is very perilous and Bella might die.Why did this final story in the Twilight Saga needed to be split into two movies at all? Part 1 could have easily been compressed down to half an hour if all the mind-numbing padding had been taken out of it.And it really is such a shame, because when the first 'Twilight' movie hit screens way back in 2008, director Catherine Hardwicke turned the script into a captivating supernatural love story, crackling with sexual tension and life, full of promise.The second installment, 'New Moon', under the direction of Chris Weitz, was so self-indulgent and turgid that I really don't want to say any more about it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't Have Unprotected Sex with Vampires,"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 (2011)** 1/2 (out of 4)The fourth film in the mega-popular series has Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) getting married and shortly afterwards the female virgin becomes pregnant, which could cause her death, which doesn't sit too well with werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner). Obviously a 32-year-old male isn't the target viewer for this film but I must admit that it was a major step up from the previous two installments. I might even go as far to say that this here was the best of the series in a bad way. I say that because I'm sure teenage girls will be weeping all over themselves through the first hour of this thing but, as an adult, I couldn't help but laugh at it. The first hour deals with the screen's most popular duo getting married and of course the girl losing her virginity. I know this is a big thing to Twi-hards and teenage girls but the execution here is just laughable and especially the moments leading up to the act. The entire thing is just directed so over-dramatic that I couldn't help but laugh. It also didn't help that the dialogue was just downright awful and at times embarrassing. With that said, these bad moments actually make the film rather entertaining. Both Pattinson and Stewart are pros at these characters by now and it's also clear that Lautner continues to work out and this must cause him to skip his acting classes. As usual the CGI is pretty bad but I guess this is to be expected. Still, I found the story to be rather compelling and the entire thing kept me entertained from start to finish. Yes it drags on too long but you have to admit there's some pretty weird stuff going on here and especially during the second half.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well . . .  it came and went by without any excitement,"Can't really say much that others haven't. Twihards will go no matter what to see this movie, but non twihards should wait until the next one comes out to watch them back to back. It's okay to wait. You won't miss anything if you do, as this movie is so boring that they never should have cut it into 2 movies to make the BILLIONS that Summit wants to make from BD.Part one of breaking dawn didn't really have anything. I mean if you haven't had sex before then I guess you'll be into the total G sex scene, but if you have had sex before you will laugh until you pee your pants.Acting is better, but it's still bad so take that for what it is. Thank you to the person who sent Ms. Greene to acting class, and made sure she showed up!! Ms. Stewart still needs help in the acting field. She has that horrible problem of allowing viewers to see her rehearse her lines in her head before saying them on the screen. It's distracting. Mr. Patterson seemed amused throughout the whole movie like he couldn't believe the words coming out of his mouth either. THE BOOK DIALOGUE IS JUST NOT THERE PEOPLE.They changed parts of the story for the movie. Pretty much everything w/ the wolves was rewritten a bit or twisted so that it is not really enjoyable to watch. Even what the going ons at the island were altered enough from the book to annoy me. Interactions I was looking forward to between the characters didn't happen, even though they were small interactions I would have loved to see them. Like the intro of BD where the boys got Bella the ""before car"". It showed their sense of humor as well as the love.After viewing Part One of Breaking Dawn, I feel that it is a cinema failure because it should not have been broken into 2 movies. The ""cliffhanger"" didn't leave me salivating for Part 2, just more thinking that they're so gonna rewrite the story just to put more battle scenes to satisfy people who already don't like the story and think it's boring.Honestly the first twilight was the best. Maybe it was the mystical feel in the filming, but these sequels are too much glitter and not enough soul.The books aren't literature, and the movies aren't blockbuster worthy, but they are an escape from reality for a short time. I only wish that executives and Meyers took more pride in their projects instead of letting them become so shallow.S. Meyers thinks there is a backlash on her books and movies because of all the publicity and hype. In a way she is correct. The backlash comes from people who read her saga, then read other series with the same subject. After reading other series such as the Vampire Academy, her fans have realized that Meyers writing is indeed elementary, and other authors have written better books, but without the publicity she has received.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A good movie for family viewing,"In my opinion, Breaking Dawn pt. 1 is slow and moody, but entertaining enough to grab most viewers. In terms of critical analysis, the film is not very good. Twilight is confusing because even though the acting (let's face it) is mostly terrible, the acting is derisive, and the pacing is too slow, I still find the film very interesting. Obviously, at this point in the franchise, the teen vampire series may include a wedding, but it really hasn't matured much and retains all the ""emo imagery"" that the previous films were filled with. Personally, I think Breaking Dawn is probably the best part of the series because it has a comfortable celebration of love that moves away from the vampire theme a bit and then reinforces us with it by the end, and the last half hour of the movie is really fantastic.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"God, I'm getting sick of this franchise!","All right, let's get this over with, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1. I can safely say that they put Part 1 just like they did with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and then just put Part 1 on it because this is the never ending story. Yeah, like the children's title, eh? The two part movies is interesting to think of even if you're a fan member you still gotta think of the expectations when those really hold up. Continuing on the saga, Jacob Black is heartbroken over Bella's choice of marrying Edward Cullen, so he runs away from town upon receiving an invitation to the wedding. They both got married and Bella's mum and dad and their friends celebrated for Bella and Edward. Jacob arrives and Bella is surprised to see him. She admits that she and Edward plan to consummate their marriage on their honeymoon. He becomes furious, knowing that such an act could kill her. After the wedding, she and Edward travel to Isle Esme for their honeymoon, and they make love for the first time. Two weeks later, Bella is pregnant and Edward thinks something is wrong knowing that the baby is not a human. They came back to the Cullens' house and the Cullen's and the team should perform an abortion, Jacob comes in and he gets angry at Edward for doing this to her but he teams up with him to prevent Bella from dying. Okay, okay, so when it comes to Twilight, nothing's happening most of the time until we get to see Bella getting pregnant with something not human but very dangerous. Alice cannot sense and see what is inside Bella until it was revealed to the end so truly something in this movie must be exciting for me, right? Well, technically, no, I am getting bored of this half arsed franchise when clearly nothing in here is exciting or entertaining about it. But why are the werewolves speaking when clearly you don't get to see there mouths moving and you're kind of being questioned to know what is going on and pretty much what the wolves are thinking about. So yeah, it's still a s**t arsed Twilight movie and I am finally going off the rest of the pentalogy by doing the second part of Breaking Dawn and definitely the final film of The Twilight Saga.

A return to badness in the series,"I am not a lover nor a detractor of the TWILIGHT franchise. I really hated the first one, found the second slightly better and the third is the best in the series (tho isn't saying much). With the fourth entry there are some steps backwards to badness.After the events of the third (the fight where vampires and wolves join their forces) Edward Cullen and Bella Swan finally marry with Jacob Black and all their relatives in attendance. After a steamy scene (that was ridicolous to the point I bursted in laughs before it was over) Bella is pregnant. This pregnancy has a much higher speed than a natural one and of course Bella suffers lots of pain to the point that few of her bones break and she gets thinner as her fetus forces her to refuse to eat. Edward feeds Bella with human blood and after a while Bella finally gives birth. Few days later Bella suffers bleeding and Edward injects some poison in her heart, and she then becomes officially a vampire (with her eyes that turn red). In the end the Volturi leader Aro (Michael Sheen) receives the news that Bella has turned into a vampire, but the dispute is not over as Aro wants Alice (the only vampire who can predict the future) with him.As you might guess by the summary, this was a huge step backward in the series. Cringeworthy scenes (such as the aforementioned steamy scene), stitled acting by Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart who looked better in the previous installments and some dull moments serve for the purpose of erasing the few worthy moments of the previous entry. Only the sets and the photography were good but this isn't saying much.Only of interest if you are into the TWILIGHT franchise or if you occasionally watch bad movies for getting a kick out of them, and also in this case it serves its purpose well.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Average at its best.,"READ THE FULL REVIEW AT http://gorgeousdave.blogspot.com/ http://gorgeousdave.blogspot.com/2011/11/twilight-saga-breaking-dawn- part-1.html Average at its best, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 is an adaptation that fairly delivers what's left of an overrated phenomenon.There is something about the Twilight saga movies that makes it an ""almost there but never quite there"" kind of movies. For starters, it wasn't able to contain the hype and mystery that makes a series adaptation compelling in every sense, kinda like what the Harry Potter series have done for 10 long years. Can it be because the first movie was an epic failure in terms of production and over-all output or is it possible that its story just doesn't have what it takes? It now becomes a crisis figuring out what went wrong in this movie franchise. Is it the story itself or perhaps just the movie adaptations? Well, I guess it's both.In the age of True Bloods and The Walking Deads where HOT, sexy, and fierce are being redefined, somehow the vampire and werewolf story this saga presents seems too bland. It's like a steak without salt and pepper, pasta without parmesan. It just feels so clich√©, predictable, and unexciting; in short, overrated in epic proportions.

twilight,"Some people can seriously over react when it comes to twilight..There are far more worse things than Twilight(Cowboys&aliens,Shark night,Piranha,The Wolf man etc). Putting someone in the love/hate category is disliked by a lot of people,but being realistic,many people belong to that category. Rating the movie 1,only because it's Twilight,or rating it 10 only because it's Twilight. If you really don't like a movie,i can respect that,but with most reviews i think that people are blinded by some kind of hate,only trying to out hate each other and to see who can screw Kristen,Robert,the producers or whatever the hardest.

Overall i liked the movies,except for some off the romantic stuff,that was just a bit to much sometimes(i my eyes).And that Robert's acting looked silly in some of those scenes is kind of obvious,i don't think there is an actor who can put that perfect on screen,i think what he showed was good. Kristen's acting improved seriously i think,i was impressed at some parts in Breaking Dawn.I like it if someone can produce tears all by itself. There wasn't much dialog in the first part of the movie,but it didn't needed to and that is the strength of the movie i think. That it might is unnecessary to split it up in two parts is one thing,but you can't blame them,it's a new trendy thing in Hollywood. Don't let the reviews from other people influence you to much and just go see it,you like it or you don't,but don't get your're judgment on before you have seen it,that's not fair for your yourself and the creators. Just be reasonable,don't be like the dumb ass in a other review that said to leave your're girlfriend when she asks you to go see twilight.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bland To Shallowness,"I never liked Twilight films but I still have faith to their upcoming movies. Unfortunately this is the second to the last Twilight movie. Breaking Dawn Part 1 still has the same problems. Blandness and dullness. Breaking Dawn has its darkness to its plot but it was executed differently. It has its intensity but mostly it's like a joke. The film is also too long. It feel longer than any two hour blockbuster we get this year. But at least this movie gave die hard Edward Cullen fans a lesson. Vampire Sex Is Deadly.The story is all about the danger of Bella's pregnancy. But the whole plot happens in the near end of the film. The whole first act feels tedious. The movie spends most of the time to Bella and Edward's honeymoon and their never ending sex. This film could've been intriguing. But it saves too much to the last part of the story. The acting also remains the same with their dull and bland personalities. The fun only occurs in the very short scene of Michael Sheen in the mid credits.The filmmaking isn't really the problem of this series. The cinematography is indeed decent. The score always fits to this series. The production design and the special effects are obviously well made. However the directors are trying to fit their style to the story. The directing here is probably decent but the grim dark moments ends up looking shallow and some of it is ludicrous.This is just the first half of the story. The next film will reveal all the questions asked in this film but this wasted 117 minutes for asking those questions. Then again, it's just another Twilight film with tedious long runtime, dullness and blandness, and any other nonsense. This film had potential by its intriguing plot but we've been cheated by splitting the story in half. I don't think it's necessary to split this book in half. Only Twilight fans will appreciate this.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movie which has been waited for 1 1/2 year,"Cant Believe it, they took more than a year to make this movie.If you are watching this episode without knowing the first three, this movie will sucks like anything. No start No End.it all start with a girl who want to marry a guy for a long time but deep down she is bit afraid, and the guy who warns her what happens if she marries him and finally it happens then all of sudden the movie will jump to the wolf gang who wants to kill their baby, of course they didn't succeed because of jacob, Then what baby born and she become a vampire. whats the catch in it whats the theme. if you are new to the twilight series better waste your time in watching first three to understand whats happening in this movie.To me its just like a one boring episode of a epic TV series.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I have to let you know I have a wife and three daughters, which is why I am even aware The Twilight Saga exists.","Okay, I have to let you know I have a wife and three daughters, which is why I am even aware The Twilight Saga exists. To my chagrin, I have seen all the movies, and on a scale of one to ten, I give them a six at the most. These are not the vampires and werewolves we grew up with, but the Gothic romance style of the stories appears to be appealing to many people, or else why make the movies in the first place. The special effects are probably the most appealing aspect of the film. The transformation of the tribal members to wolves is interesting and very smooth. The scenery is beautiful, and the photography is exceptional. As to the acting, well, I doubt if anyone at the academy is looking to give any Oscars away, but the actors are sufficient in a melodramatic way. I personally thought I was watching a soap opera, and not feature length film. All that being said, I think, much like the Harry Potter series, the purpose of extending this final film in the series to two episodes is more financial than artistic, and the action suffers for it. Little more than a wedding, a honeymoon, a pregnancy, and ¬Ö well, that would be telling. Rated PG-13, so the little ones will best be in bed, but the teenage girls will eat it up.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big disappointment!,"I was surprised today when I red newspaper's critics about this film.He wrote that Twilight Saga is for youngest teenagers!?! Well I am almost forty I love the books.Also I love the first film. Twilight was so refreshing, something totally new.It had a few little mistakes, but that couldn't ruin the impression.I felt great desire of all members of movie crew for this film to revive.It worked for me. New Moon film was pretty bad.The dramatic scenes were so pathetic that I wanted to vomit.Special effects were good. Eclipse was good action movie.So much better then second but worst then first. Breaking Dawn Part 1 I watched just few hours ago.It is so bad.I am angry.The whole story is happening around Bella.Her character is full with details.But Edward and Jakob are like shadows.Director threw at me scene by scene,like he retell the book without author seal.Some scenes are so long and boring.For those who didn't read the book it's going to be confusing.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My opinion:a great movie,"I don't get why people are giving their best shot to be mean with their reviews... I think that a movie can never be as good as the book,as long as we talk about a good book... The problem with Twilight Saga is that because of it's fame everybody feels the need to say his opinion about each movie even if it's not their taste...I mean I would never say my opinion or write a review about a drama movie or a documentary.I don't like this kind of movies so whatever I say I'm gonna be unfair... The same happens with this case...People,old ones,who logically don't like teen movies are writing as bad reviews as they can... People it's not for your age!Of course you have the right to watch it, but let the people who like this kind of movies to rate it.Cause I'm pretty sure that you don't judge the effects and the way it was directed but it's plot... I happen to like the books and I think that Breaking Dawn was Great!The screen writer managed to follow the book and in some scenes made it really funny...And I loved all the intensive scenes!All in all it's a great movie,for those who like this kind of movies,and it doesn't disappoint the fans of the books.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Watchwable Set-up for Part 2,"Edward (Pattinson) and Bella (Stewart) marry and deal with the consequences of a marriage between Vampire and human. The Werewolves want to kill Bella's baby because they believe it is a demon.The first story in this Vampire series was, perhaps, the best. The sequels just made a lot money and didn't progress as we had anticipated. Hey, we had high hopes. Didn't happen.What kept this series alive were the questions: Will Bella marry Edward, or Werewolf Jacob (Lautner)? If she marries Edward, will he turn her into a Vampire? If they have a baby what will it be: Vampire or human? If she marries Jacob, then what? And, will Bella's family ever find out what is really going on? Will we?Anyone who watches this Part 1 will immediately see that the story was stretched out waiting for Part 2 when we suspect many things will happen to conclude this saga. Witness the wedding, which went on for too long and where the dialogues were stilted and slow as lines were mouthed as though the characters were rehearsing them. And, the honeymoon also went on for too long and anyone could tell Bella was not a happy camper.The wedding and the honeymoon took up about half of the movie and both could be termed ""awkward."" As we watched, we kept asking: what is going on here?A spark of life comes on the scene when Jacob appears and the movie picks up some. When the Werewolves make their appearance, we could see the CGI wasn't as good as in previous episodes. We were not amused.This Part 1 is just a setup for Part 2 when everything will come full circle, hopefully. Also the acting performances were disappointing all around. Not good. We expected better after all this time.However, the very last scene in here tells us that Part 2 will be a real EYE-OPENER. Let's hope.Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes, but this too was awkward and nothing is seen. Nudity: Partial. No frontal. Language: No.Rating: C (5/10)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not a movie but a soap, movie makers to be penalized with no revenue","I watched the first one after some insistence by my girl friend. I have to admit, the first one was a fairly decent movie, which translates to a 4/5 rating on IMDb.After that it has all been about making sequels or as many movies as possible ...Most movie goers to the cinemas to watch movies, not a soap that comes out with a new episode every few months.I got conned into seeing until the third part of this epic nonsense, simply because I wanted to see how the story ends.Such intentions from movie makers need to be punished by ensuring they don't get any ticket sales or any revenue from such movies.It becomes very clear after the first one or two parts that the movie makers simply intend to never conclude the movie and wish to milk as many of us movie fans who will shell out money because we want to know how the story concludes ...Okay fine, if you made a good first movie, you can make the extra money from a second part .. But half a dozen sequels of complete garbage is a bit too much.... Movie goers, we need to wisen up to these gimmicks ...I would love to give negative ratings to such movies, but the IMDb scoring system will ignore very low scores and hence I am giving this to 2, which is close to where it is rated now, but still far enough so that it will drag the overall rating further down.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Although there is not much fighting or action pact it is a good story and worth watching.

Worst Movie Ever Acted Out,"I have the worst tendency to not sit still and read, so I listened to the audio version of this book. I thought the character imitations were dreadful, but patiently waited for the movie to see what they would make of it. They skipped like 90% of the book, and what they did follow SUCKED. The dramatic parts were so dramatically cheesy the entire theater was laughing, and it was all jumbled together so badly that it didn't even make any sense. If I hadn't read the book, I would have been so confused. However, since I did ""read"" the book, I'm offended they call this the first installment of the book, because its nothing like it. Its really every actor/ress's worst attempt at Twilight yet, and I can't believe that I spent my hard earned money on this. Most horrible movie yet, and I'm a damn good fan, but this was just....no words but...disappointment. The only good part of the movie, was the ending. I'm really hoping that they redeem themselves in the next chapter. I wouldn't spend any money on this; even at the dollar theater. Its THAT bad.

Edward and Bella finally have sex,"No matter what I or any one else say, there will be a lot of people who have already made up their minds on whether they are going to The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 and the most positive or negative reviews will never change that. Opinions between Twi-hards and Twi-haters are extremely polarised, but it is my duty to give an honest opinion on the latest chapter of the saga.It has finally happened. Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella (Kristen Stewart) have tied the knot and, despite some pre-wedding nerves, it seems like a success. The two lovers spend their honeymoon on a tropical island off the coast of Brazil and we get the moment we have all been waiting for: they finally have sex. But a shock is in store when Bella ends up pregnant (remember kids, always practise safe sex) and the human-vampire foetus is killing her from the inside. As the Cullens try to save Bella, the Quileute tribe set out to kill her and the child, believing it will be a threat and abomination. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) ends up being torn between his loyalty to the tribe, his hatred for Edward, and his love for Bella.There is a new trend in Hollywood to split book adaptations into two parts. It made sense with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, because that was a long novel with a many elements that were interlinked and it needed to be told in two parts, but ""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" was trying to stretch the material to fit the allocated time. There are numerous montages, such as the honeymoon, which could have easily been shortened to make a single, stronger movie. The film had very little plot too; it's basically about a complicated pregnancy that just happened to feature vampires and werewolves.There is a melodramatic tone throughout, amplified by the music, whether it was the piano-heavy soft moments, the epic score (often played over non-epic moments), or the emo rock songs. A little melodrama is fine, but it goes on for most of the movie, and when there is little hook of a story, it just becomes a drag. Even people who are fans to the series will admit that dialogue has never been its strong suit. Bill Condon attempts to make the sex scene and honeymoon to be tender, but it came off more sappy and overbearing.""Part 1's"" strength is that it is the best-acted of the series. Stewart certainly gives it a good go and Lautner gives what is a half-way decent performance. Pattinson was slumming it, but with some of the cheesy dialogue he has to say, even someone like Laurence Olivier would have struggled.Condon does have a few moments of visual darkness, including the dream sequence in the beginning with its juxtaposition of bright white clothing and blood and Bella and Edward standing on top of a load of corpses. The birth scene was actually intense and gory. But these are counter-balanced with goofy moments, one of the most infamous being a psychic werewolf argument.The whole wedding sequence and honeymoon plays like a young girl's fantasy, sort of idealistic. This is fine, but hardly dramatic and not likely to have wide appeal.Previous ""Twilight"" movies have had some interesting side issues that could and should have been explored. This is not the case with ""Part 1."" There are no issues of a man resisting his urges and dark side, a young teen forced into being a vampire, an army of powerful new vampires being formed and the idea of there being a vampire council. There is nothing like that. The few themes there are include a look into Edward's past, a brief debate about abortion and the idea of imprinting, which is basically brainwashing. A better idea could be looking at somebody forcing someone else to love them. That would be a dark story.""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" is the weakest movie in the series I have seen so far and I speak as someone who is neutral to the overall experience.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An abortion ad which isn't sure which side to support.,"The Twilight saga is not the smartest thing that has happened to the universe, but for a moment I am going to cast all my past disdain aside. I am willing to forget that it has repeatedly raped vampires. I am willing to forget that it has no logical consistency whatsoever and I am also perfectly willing to forget that my girlfriend dumped me for not being 'sparkly as Edward in the sunlight.' With Breaking Dawn, like the title suggests, it is a fresh start - a new dawn.That's a lie. Obviously.First scene - Jacob Black (Taylor Lautner) and his muscles (Photoshop) storm out of the house in a fit of rage. They barely walks two steps when they decide that they don't like their shirt very much and Jacob removes it to reveal his perfectly sculpted, Greek-God-like body. He does that in the zarking rain, by the way, just because that makes a whole lot of sense. The move achieves the desired result - drool, drool, drool. Jacob and his muscles have an understandable reason for their apoplexy. Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), who is their crush, and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), the glow-in-the-sun vampire, are finally getting wed. But our part-time werewolf isn't happy, no sir.First thirty minutes and they are still getting wed in the most depressing public gathering I have seen. The camera meanders through Bella's face, to her feet, to the cape she's dragging behind her, to her face, to the back of her head, down her neck, down her back and back to her goddamn face again; all as she walks down the aisle with her father Charlie (Billy Burke). Everyone's happy, except Bella, who maintains a jizzed-in-my-pants expression on her face, and does pretty good job out of it. Jacob and his muscles make a ""surprise"" appearance to warn Bella against the dangers of vampire-intercourse and pregnancy, before Bella and Edward sneak off to Brazil to celebrate their honeymoon.The honeymoon is the second most creepy thing that happens in the movie. Ensconced within a cozy hut, this is the place where Bella and Edward finally do it. The entire purpose of the series is accomplished here in one nasty night. That is why everyone was reading it, seeing it and going gaga about it. They wanted to know how the process of inter-specie human-vampire coitus feels. Why is it creepy? a) If you didn't read it correctly, I just said human-vampire coitus. Yes, a human having it with a vampire! Is that even legal? b) Bella is 18, Edward around a hundred. If you consider his other age, 17, he becomes a minor in half of the American states. c) They break the bed while doing it. What is he? A baby elephant?And guess what happens then! Oh, you already know it! Bella gets pregnant! Surprise, surprise! How could Edward do this?! With his lifespan he still hasn't learnt the use of protection! What a dumbass! Jacob and his muscles warned her! What will happen now?! She will die! But, wait! Maybe she will shove a few contraceptives down her throat! Or maybe she'll abort the foetus! But she is Bella Swan, The Vanquisher of Death! She won't do any of those things! Because human-vampire intercourse often kills common sense!The thing that single-handedly grabs the prize for being the most egregious thing about the film is the story. They made a hundred and seventeen minute-long movie on marriage, childbirth and the benefits of abortion. Are you kidding me?The acting isn't world class, either. All the actors do is maintain one- pained, long-drawn expression on their faces - of anguish. The three lead characters, Lautner, Pattinson and their prized-trophy Stewart, still haven't learnt what it takes to become real actors. At this point, it isn't even funny; it's just pitiful.The most creepy thing that happens in the movie is the child-birth process, and if creepy isn't bad enough, the movie also makes it disgusting. Bella's face contorts into hideous shapes, she screams like her head is on fire and there is even plenty of blood and biting. Sure, it might be realistic and all but that is not what the viewers paid for. They don't want to know how cross-breeds-between-vampires-and-humans are born. There was absolutely no reason to show it the way they did. Eating your popcorn and drinking coke during that scene is a very bad idea.Jacob and his muscles are the only sane ones in this almighty mess, after all he seems to be the only one who knows that inter-specie sex is a bad idea indeed. With the exception of Jacob, his muscles and their sanity in this asylum, along with the decent soundtrack, the film is sickeningly obnoxious. What I really want to see after this is what happens after 50 years when they are sick and tired of each other and realize what incredible fools they were to take such drastic (REALLY DRASTIC) steps on mere infatuation. My guess is that they will blame it on the hormones. Everyone does.Ah, another thing before I forget. The film scores some brownie points for asking some really thought provoking questions like Bella asking Edward ""Are you a virgin?"" or the even more amazing concerning her pregnancy ""I know that it's impossible, but I think I am pregnant... Can this really happen?"" Good questions, Mrs. Cullen.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twlight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1 Review,"THERE ARE NO SPOILERS Compared to the first three movies (which I did not extremely like either), this movie is the worst in the series. It may follow the main plot of the book, but the most important details are left out. Much of the plot completely disappears throughout the movie. If you have read the books before, you will consider this movie a major disappointment that will ruin your idea of the Twilight series. Even though the acting is somewhat good, I think Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson could have done much better. Much of the acting was very fake and most of the movie left a sore thought in my head. Many of the scenes were poorly written and the whole movie was basically very repetitive. In the movie, the main focus of the two lovers is lost and they overuse kisses and other things that I won't go into detail. I know already that many of you will dislike me for comparing this to Harry Potter but I feel the need to. Harry Potter, although also released almost annually, has followed the books in detail even though some of the plot usually had to be cut out due to length issues. I feel that the acting in Harry Potter is always very superb compared to the poor jobs done in this movie. Overall, I do not recommend this movie unless you are a very very hardcore Twilight fan and you must see all the movies immediately. If you are just an in between, I suggest waiting to rent or buy it on DVD/Blu-Ray.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This film was laughably terrible,"If IMDb allowed me to give zero stars I would. This movie was so insurmountably awful, it was comedic. My friends and I were talking through the whole film because it was so boring. Here are just few of the innumerable problems: -half of the movie was nothing. it was clearly a mistake splitting the last movie in two because the first half of the movie was just bella and edward having sex and the last half was just bella being tortured by her pregnancy. -barely anything happened in the film (see above) -the script was laammeee. the movie didn't convey half of the angst or pain rendered in the novel. I know it's difficult to make a movie out of a book, but come on that was just obscene (and the book wasn't that great to begin with) -the ending (i can't say anymore but you'll see) -while I'm at it the beginning and middle were also terrible all of the good things: -kristen stewart's acting was noticeable improved. now that she's dating rob the two share some on screen chemistry -the graphics -the girl they chose for the new character (can't say who bc it may be a spoiler) DON'T MAKE MY MISTAKE AND PAY TO SEE THIS FILM IN THEATERS!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The series spun a heart-twisting tale of love and passion between two souls ‚Äì one of a human and one of a vampire!,"I saw the midnight showing last night, and I will return to the theaters tonight to see the film again. From start to finish the film was surprising, funny, and warm. My husband was not into twilight but couldn't help but know about it, because of me. He didn't enjoy the first 2 films, but eclipse became his favorite. After watching Breaking Dawn last night, he best described it as a ""tender"" film. He felt the emotions, the comedy, and the display of Edward and Bella's relationship was ""warm and tender."" In his opinion it is his favorite film and now he can't wait until next year for part 2. I appreciate Bill Condon's respect for the series, you can't help but notice the passion and dedication he and the actors put into this film. I know part 2 will not disappoint. Not one actor fell short in presence on the screen. Taylor Launter and Robert Pattinson brought their A game, I could feel their emotions rolling off the screen, it was an intense experience watching them in action. Some characters that were 2d in other films of the series, got their moment in this film, Leah Clearwater was one that brought me to the brink of tears. When she said how lonely and unwanted she felt by everyone, paired with her expressions, my mind went back to eclipse after Jacob got hurt and everyone was huddled around Billy Black's house listening to Carlisle re-break his bones. Leah was on the outside of the circle, holding herself, looking in. It crushed me, lol I almost felt like I had abandoned her for not really noticing the character before. This film is worth seeing and it redeems itself from all the critiques of the past. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets at least an Oscar Nomination.

For Fans of the Book,"Finally Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart play their characters almost perfectly, and they're not the only ones. Billy Burke who has always been good has some great moments with Kristen. They seem to know their characters so well by now and it's wonderful to finally see. The much talked about sex scene was very sweet and romantic, the birthing scene was not as gruesome as I'd have liked it to be, but Kristen's performance in it was great.I felt her pain. Robert is also great in that scene. Vampires can't cry, but you can feel his loss. Taylor doesn't really bring anything to the movie. He pretty much walks around sulking throughout the movie. The only part I have a problem with is when Jacob separates himself from the pack. I felt like I entered a cartoon movie with their booming voices. It worked in the book, but in the movie they probably should have been human for that scene. The movie was definitely not rushed, and I can understand how someone who doesn't like twilight that much would find it boring and too long, but for hardcore twihards this is a pretty perfect adaptation of the first part of the novel.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
worst movie ever.,"This was the worst movie I have seen in my entire life. To give this a rating, i would put in my top five-hundred favorite movies and i have only seen a total of three-hundred movies in my lifetime. The acting was terrible in this movie. I have seen Robert Patterson in better movies and they have been great movies I have enjoyed. Twilight was not one of them. I have to admit this has the best acting and make-up, but still didn't quite make it for me. I watched that screen for a total of about 45 minutes. I was really angry to see Bella on top of Edward for half of the movie making out with him and making love with him. It was too much of me to handle. It got pretty scandalous and graphic for me as well. I laughed at most of the sad parts because of how funny everybody's reaction was in the movie and how terrible they were in reacting. I would not recommend any guy to go see it at any time with anyone. It was the worst movie ever made.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful,"The Twilight Saga is essentially a love story. When I go see a Twilight film at the cinema I'm going because I want to see the story of Bella & Edwards love, any extra action in the movies is just a bonus. If you don't like watching films that focus on two people in love then just don't go see Twilight, but don't take the time to review it either because your judgement of the film won't be valid if it was just never going to be your type of film to begin with. Anyway, as a 25 year old female I thought this film was beautiful. I've read the books but I try not to read them too much before seeing a film because then I'd just be going over everything that was missed out or not done exactly right. I just go see the film for what it is, their best effort to make a film 'based' on a very thick book. I was so happy with Breaking Dawn. Wedding scenes are of course scenes that countless films and TV shows have done again and again but no wedding has ever been filmed as beautifully as this one. I felt like I was there and I was getting a bit emotional watching it. One of the great things about this movie is that a lot of time is spent on getting the romance and real love between Bella & Edward right. These guys are good together, and it was nice to see them so happily in love. Kristen and Rob have worked hard to get these scenes exactly right and as I fan I really appreciate that. While I was looking forward to the wedding and sex scene, the other scenes I was a bit unsure of as I wasn't really sure how they could film it on a way that would work but it certainly exceeded my expectations and the imprinting and birth scene were both done amazingly. I won't go on about every scene I loved, I'll just say I was thrilled with this movie as were the people I was with and anyone else I've spoken to about it. Also the final scene, couldn't have done it any better, it was visually amazing to watch.Definitely the most emotional and beautiful Twilight film so far. Well done to everyone who worked on this film : )",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Actually it's not OK,"I'm assuming you have seen the trailer for the movie (though I guess most don't even care for that, so most reviews will mention what I do, without a ""warning""), so there is no spoiler in here for you. I'm going to tackle a few things that it reveals (of course in the movie in a bigger scale), that are just insane.While I thought the first Twilight movie was exactly what it promised to be (a wet teenage girls dream, literally in both senses), the subsequent movies (and I assume books, though I haven't read them) seem to lose their focus. While even with the first one I was sure someone ripped of Buffy and mixed it with OC (or any other soap that has beautiful people in it for that matter), I'm not sure what this latest installment is trying to do.Except having a very bad message for teenage girls (target audience!). It promotes violent intercourse as is obvious by the trailer and even more apparent in the movie. It is also pro Life, in a way that puts Rosemarys Baby into shame. And all the way through you get the pain (maybe even physical) through your bones. Irrational seeming decisions and longing looks make this seem like a parody in itself. But it never quite achieves to really amuse you (although ""Vampires Suck"" couldn't achieve that either).So while there are still fans out there (and they will strongly disagree with me), who know their books (I even got schooled on some interactions that are only hinted at in the movie), this is a real dangerous movie for all the wrong reasons",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simply Amazing,"Words can not describe how great the movie is.I didn't have highest expectations, But I can definitely say that the directer did an amazing job and the acting is so much better. Of course the first film is always best.. But now after seeing breaking dawn, New Moon And Eclipse were very disappointing. The thing I liked the most is how little things from Twilight (first movie) was also used in breaking dawn, like the music and a little montage it kind of gives closure to the story.I'm not a hardcore fan but the twilight sage will always have a special place in my heart. Even though you think the book is stupid, don't be so harsh. Give it a chance you never know you might like it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't waste your money,"I was extremely disappointed with the movie after all the publicity that has been going on, saying that's the best movie of the series so far. I disagree! It was the worst! I read the book and the wedding is supposed to be a huge event, where Bella looked gorgeous. Well, she was beyond plain, her nails were not even done!!! Her facial expression was of extreme fear and uncertainty, instead of joy and love, like you would expect from someone who is getting married to the love of her life. The wolves were much smaller compared to the other movies - that's what happens when you have one director for each movie. I was in love with the book and this movie ruined it for me. I almost fell asleep while watching the movie!!! I guess the best part of the movie was the beautiful scenes shot in Brazil - that's about it.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad at all!,"First of all let me say that I'm a fan of the books. I enjoyed the theme and the story itself. So, when I saw the movies I was already prepared for the lame dialogues, specially between Bella and Edward. Even with these lame moments I must say I enjoyed this last movie. It portrays really well what happens in the book and it didn't disappoint me. Regarding the acting, I thought Kristen Stewart finally delivered a convincing performance. I think this is a movie that only fans will like and only they will appreciate the time that was given to portray the evolution in the relationship between the characters. When the movie ended it left me with the desire to see the last one soon which, in my opinion, means that it was not a bad movie at all!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fairly average adaptation,"This movie will appeal to die hard fans of the series. It is a reasonable adaption of the first part of the book. The graphical presentation is impressive. You do get a sense for the environment and breathtaking locations. However the acting is weak all-round. None of key moments are portrayed with any sense of conviction and this leads to an average presentation. The story telling is also a weak point, since film fails to convey the inner turmoil experienced by the main protagonists.Considering the target audience, I think this movie will perform reasonably well at the box-office in anticipation of the finale'.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Chilling, Beautiful, Intense, and repulsive...This Film is GENIUS.","I had a lot of hope in this movie and last week when the reviews started to come out my enthusiasm went down loads as it was being trashed. In no way was Breaking Dawn my favorite book, that was definitely Twilight or Eclipse, but Bill Condon gave me hope and when I saw the reviews I lost a lot of faith in him. Now let me tell you I went into the theater extremely worried...IT WAS AMAZING.Now I still think Eclipse was the best one. But everything I loved about Twilight was in this. The awkward but cute Edward and Bella moments, the cinematography, and the whole entire set was great. The movie starts with Bella getting ready for her wedding and soon enough the time has come and she's speeding her way down the isle for Edward. The movie takes off to Isle Esme, which by the way was absolutely beautiful, and they repeatedly make out and have sex.Now this was what I considered the first half, and the worst half, of the movie. Not that it was bad but it could have been edited very much so. Although, I did enjoy that flashback scene of Edward at the movies...that was interesting. Now part 2 of the film is where I finally saw some awesome things. The acting was top-notch, never had I ever felt Bella that much.Edward was in-pain, but the scene where he hears Reneseme's thoughts was soo cute. And I loved all the wolf-pack stuff which I thought I'd hate, but some of the stuff was actually pretty neat. I LOVED the wolf pack scene where Jacob leaves the pack. It's really, really amazingly directed although the voices were kind of annoying.But it was the birth scene that had my stomach curling and it was when I officially realized how brilliant the movie really was. The way it made you feel, repulsive and sick, it was just perfect. And then the ending when Bella was transforming there may or may not of have been tears in my eyes. SO WONDERFUL.Overall, there were some flaws like the lack of Leah and Seth who were key parts to the novel. And I do think some of the wedding could have been cut out. I never liked Ashley Greene as Alice, but she did a terrible job in this film. Could not get myself to like her as Alice at all in this one.The movie was funny especially the cute toast scene, all the honey moon scenes were beautiful, the pregnant stuff was super intense, the wolf pack was finally just how I pictured it to be like, and finally the birth scene was just pure brilliance.Thank you Bill Condon. 8.5/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1When a woman marries a vampire she must be prepared for the unexpected, like, when the groom and his side of the family spontaneously combust inside the church.Fortunately, the unconventional couple in this drama exchanged their vows sans God.On the eve of her marriage to the vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson), 18-year-old Bella (Kristen Stewart) is fraught by doubt over tying the knot.Though the ceremony is a success, a subsequent visit from Jacob (Taylor Lautner) reignites the war between werewolves and vampires, when he learns of the couple's plan to conceive while Bella is still mortal.As expected, her health deteriorates when her body cannot handle the rapid gestation.The fourth instalment of the popular film franchise, Breaking Dawn is a melodramatic maelstrom of weepy alt-rock love songs and nightmarish imagery of teen pregnancy.Besides, what woman wants to simultaneously breast-feed her newborn and neck-feed her new husband?

The expectations for the second part went somehow huge after this failure. It will have to compensate for the lack of ""juice"".

This movie is by far my favourite and I'm sure Part 2 will be just as great :) The location of Isle Esme was also absolutely amazing and was just perfect for the vision Stephenie Meyer creates in the book.

Amazing. This is coming from someone who is now a die-hard Twilight fan.,"Everything about this movie is amazing. That is all you need to know about this movie. I HIGHLY recommend it. I read the book and was expecting it to be a let compared to Twilight: Eclipse. Boy was I wrong. The effects were great, the make-up, the setting, everything was great. I was so sucked in to the movie that I did not even realize it was almost 2 hours long. It had a good way of keeping you interested and then left you wanting more at the end.

They're Married,"Finally that dead/undead duo of Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart have finally tied the knot though Stewart's father is not ecstatic over her choice of life or after life partner if you will.

And Stewart is in a family way. But giving birth to a vampire is difficult indeed and there are no vampire obstetricians apparently.Taylor Lautner as the Indian wolf prince of his tribe is still the odd man out in the triangle. Poor kid, personally I'd have taken him before Pattinson. The possible birth of the Pattinson/Stewart child is held as a threat to his people so Lautner has some critical choices to make.

Breaking Yawn,I cannot even begin to tell you the high hopes I had for this installment in a series that has not really grabbed me and made me even want to pick up the books when I heard Bill Condon was directing because I am on of his biggest fans. You could have just stabbed my eyes to keep me awake this yawner was the worst in the series and while I cannot even give an average score to any of them this one just killed it for me nail in the coffin its boring. The best scene and I kid you not is the wedding which was staged so beautifully but how much more of this tripe am I going to endure as a horror fan. This movie makes some SyFy Saturday movies look like masterpieces. Really Bill Condon can do much better and since I have never read the books was this really worth the budget. I won't even go into the lifeless performances or the nearly lethargic pace. Jacob imprinting on an infant really???

worthless except for fans,"Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edwards (Robert Pattinson) get married gathering the disparate parts of their lives together. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) is not happy. On their honeymoon, Bella gets pregnant which is impossible. The baby grows abnormally fast and the wolf pack fears it as a threat.This is basically fan service. Of course, nobody has any reasons to watch this other than fans of the franchise. The first half hour is the wedding and it's not anything other than a few soap opera highlights. The second half hour is the honeymoon most notable for breaking the bed. When Bella gets pregnant, it becomes fully a soap opera. The baby is a little creepy like 'Rosemary's Baby'.

When Bella becomes pregnant there's a concern if she can survive having a vampire baby...This movie is directed by Bill Condon (Dream Girls) and stars Kristen Stewart (Snow White and the Huntsmen), Robert Pattinson (The Batman), Taylor Lautner (Abduction), Billy Burke (Drive Angry), Gil Birmingham (Hell or High Water) and Peter Facinelli (The Vanished).This was a very uneven movie that wasn't as bad as some reviews make it out to be but isn't great either. The wedding was a bit awkward. Jake still being jealous was ridiculous as this point and unnecessary. The baby name process was also weird. The acting is inconsistent with Stewart being off as usual.

A Step in the Right Direction,"Jumping on the early 2010s trend of splitting the final movie in two, Breaking Dawn Part One delivers the first half of the Twilight saga conclusion. While the previous three installments have left much to be desired, the final two promise to deliver a satisfying ending. Leaving audiences with the news of an impending wedding and the omnipresent threat of the Volturi, Eclipse set the stage for the dramatic two-part finale.After 3 years of films, Bella (Kristen Stewart) & Edward (Robert Pattinson) finally arrive on their wedding day. After a lovely ceremony, the newlyweds embark on their honeymoon and quickly find themselves expecting. Complicating the issue, the baby she is carrying will be a half-vampire and begin feeding off her. With the clock ticking, Bella must decide between their child and her life.In its fourth installment, the Twilight saga finally improves. While I could be biased (since we unintentionally shared the same wedding entrance music) Breaking Dawn finally had the characters feeling developed and grown as people. The cast improves on their performances and are all given better material to work with besides the repetitive relationship drama.The story feels neat and thankfully lacks the more useless subplot of the previous films. While the previous films felt unnecessarily bloated, Breaking Dawn delivers a more complete story, not relying on filler and drawn-out moments. Breaking Dawn- Part One sets up the Twilight saga conclusion and truly feels that it could have been a satisfying final chapter.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The sweetest movie in the saga.,"This film was based on a series of ""best seller"" books about the romance between a vampire and a young human. I never read the books (nor do I intend to), but if Edward and Bella's love story was supposed to be epic, something didn't work. Despite this, this film was, like its predecessors, a box office champion, teenagers consumed it well and the studio rubbed its hands with satisfaction.The plot boils down to this: after defeating Victoria and her army, Edward and Bella decide to get married, much to Jacob's sadness. But something goes wrong on the honeymoon in Brazil and Bella reveals symptoms of pregnancy, which makes no sense since vampires shouldn't be able to have children. The speed of development of the fetus and the aggressive way it is sucking the energies and nutrients from Bella's body makes everyone fear for her life, and for the nature of the being she carries.The new director is Bill Condon, who to me is a stranger. Unlike its direct predecessor, it replaces the action and the fight scenes with a certain cinematic sense and a growing tension that helps to mitigate the excessive sweetness of the story and make the film tolerable. In fact, I think this is the most sweet and sugary film in the saga, which was a negative point. The action reaches its climax in the delivery scene, one of the best in the saga, and the ending was very well achieved. The pace of the film is also much more balanced than its direct predecessor, although it is still slow.Despite everything, the film still has problems inherited from previous films. Each film accentuates the feeling that Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson were casting errors. With a few exceptions (the wedding scene, the sex scene, the birth scene) there is almost no chemistry between them. There is, in fact, a general improvement in their performance, but Stewart still has to work on her lack of facial expression. Pattinson has also improved a lot and helped to give strength and passion to Edward and Bella's romance (finally!). Taylor Lautner, who started the saga well and grew, eclipses itself throughout this film, perhaps the result of the loss of relevance of his character. The actor is not to blame, he proved to be better than he is here, but he cannot do better when the material given to him by the screenwriter sucks, and that was a constant problem in the saga films. If there was anyone who, throughout the entire saga, signed a certificate of incompetence and imbecility, it was Melissa Rosenberg. The secondary cast maintains the positive level of previous films. Billy Burke and Ashley Greene are very good, as are Peter Facinelli, Elizabeth Reaser, Nikki Reed, Maggie Grace and Booboo Stewart.Technically, the film maintains the good CGI, visible in the work of the wolves but is more discreet in its visual and computational resources than the previous film. The soundtrack this time is signed by Carter Burwell and is very good. Good scenarios, props, and very good images of large-scale landscapes complete the technical work. I particularly liked the cinematography of scenes with the wedding or the sex scene, one of the most beautiful I have ever seen in cinema, without excessive nudity, proving that it is not necessary to show ""the thing happening"" to make a good sex scene in cinema.This film is the most romantic in the franchise, and the initial half is just honey, making us sick to the point of almost giving up on seeing the rest. It greatly improves the medium to the end, with the introduction of elements of tension and increasing danger to temper the excessive sweetness and to mask the failures of the main actors.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Slow and Uneven Build-Up,"""Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" stretches its thin storyline into a full-length film, resulting in a slow-paced, often awkward installment that struggles to justify its existence as a separate entry. While it features some major developments in Bella and Edward's story, the execution lacks the emotional weight and engagement needed to make it compelling.Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson continue their brooding performances, but their chemistry remains inconsistent. Taylor Lautner's Jacob gets more emotional depth this time, yet the love triangle still feels unnecessary at this stage. The supporting characters, as in previous films, are mostly sidelined, missing an opportunity to add more complexity to the story.Visually, the film maintains the franchise's signature moody aesthetic, but the direction feels more melodramatic than ever. The wedding sequence is one of the film's highlights, providing some genuinely well-shot moments. However, the rest of the film is weighed down by an overlong honeymoon sequence and an unsettling final act that feels more bizarre than impactful. The CGI, especially in some crucial moments, is noticeably poor, further diminishing the film's effectiveness.Ultimately, ""Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" feels like an unnecessary split, dragging out events that could have been covered more effectively in a single movie. While it sets the stage for the conclusion, it lacks the engagement needed to stand on its own as a strong entry.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Forever Changed,"Part 1 is the fourth installment in the Twilight Saga film series, delivering a visually stunning and emotionally charged cinematic experience. This chapter marks a significant turning point for Bella and Edward's relationship, as their marriage ushers in a new chapter filled with both joy and peril. Bella's pregnancy takes a dangerous turn, and the film masterfully captures the emotional rollercoaster of the characters, from the elation of their wedding to the terrifying uncertainty of Bella's condition.Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson deliver strong performances, conveying the depth of their characters' love and the anxieties that accompany their newfound life together. Michael Sheen is particularly captivating as Aro, the enigmatic leader of the Volturi, adding a layer of intrigue and menace to the proceedings. The film boasts impressive visual effects, particularly during the intense and emotionally charged birth scene, showcasing the power of modern filmmaking.However, the film's pacing can feel uneven at times. Certain scenes, particularly those focusing on the mundane aspects of married life, may drag, while others, like the climactic confrontation with the Volturi, feel rushed.Breaking Dawn - Part 1 effectively explores themes of forbidden love, the dangers of obsession, and the complexities of family within the context of the vampire world. The film successfully translates many of the key elements from Stephenie Meyer's novel to the screen, capturing the essence of the story while making some necessary adjustments for cinematic adaptation.While a surefire hit with fans of the Twilight Saga and those who enjoy romantic fantasy, the film may not resonate with viewers who prefer more grounded or critically acclaimed cinema. Its melodramatic tone and focus on supernatural elements may not appeal to those seeking realism or complex character development.Overall, Breaking Dawn - Part 1 is a visually impressive and emotionally charged installment in the Twilight Saga.

I also loved the three previous films, but this one so different and so awesome and unique in the same time. The wedding scene so moving...The honeymoon...full of deep feelings and heartbeats...The pregnancy..the birth and the final scene...can't really describe with words!!!!!!!! The only negative thing about this movie is a)it leaves you again with much more bigger anticipation for part II -Jeeezzz...another full year!!?!, b)leaves you ""thirsty"" for more love scenes (hopefully some extra scenes will be included in the DVD release :-)))) ).

I found an interesting take on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"I found an interesting take on The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 here:http://4thdimensionfilms.wordpress.com/Once upon a time, Hollywood made movies intended to be seen in one sitting usually lasting 90 minutes or so.You told a story with a beginning, a middle and an end‚Äîvoil√†, there's your movie.But toward the end of the 20th century when executives decided to establish the sequel as the preferred business model in the American film industry‚Äîand theoretically ensure a stream of income lasting years if not decades‚Äîbrevity no longer equaled bankroll and all bets were off.So it comes as no surprise that the fourth release from the Twilight machine, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1, should once again prove to be a huge maybe even record-breaking commercial success.By some estimates, the Twilight film franchise has already earned nearly $2 billion to date‚Äîequal to the entire GDP of some foreign countries.But just why do films like The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 reap huge box office receipts over and over again?",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Similarly to the first and second parts, there is an overload of things which make you easily uncomfortable. Especially if you are an overthinker, or depressed (even worse).

Best movie of the season!,"My fianc√© and I absolutely loved this movie! The actors, director and crew did an amazing job! I especially enjoyed the way the camera seemed to capture the palpable, raw emotion in each epic scene. We loved the way the film adhered to the book perfectly and the wonderful portrayal of the wedding, honeymoon, and pregnancy scenes. The one part of the film that really got to me was, of course, the wedding scene. Kristen Stewart as Bella made for a breathtakingly beautiful bride! As you hear the sweet and endearing vows proclaimed by Edward and Bella you start to almost feel the truly heart-stopping feeling of true love. We also adored the wolf scenes which were strikingly realistic and the use of the ""wolf-telepathy"" in the film. Overall, this film was an exhilarating instant-classic that keeps you on the edge of your seat and yearning for more!! Can't wait for part two!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Disappointing Build-Up to the Finale,"Breaking Dawn - Part 1 struggles under the weight of stretching half a book into an entire film, resulting in a slow-paced and underwhelming entry in The Twilight Saga. While it sets the stage for the grand finale, this installment lacks the compelling drama and action that made earlier films in the series more engaging.The story focuses on Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward's (Robert Pattinson) wedding and honeymoon, followed by Bella's tumultuous pregnancy with their hybrid child. While these moments hold potential for emotional depth, the execution often feels dragged out, leaving the narrative feeling stagnant.Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson deliver decent performances, but the material doesn't give them much to work with. The supporting characters, including Taylor Lautner's Jacob, have minimal impact, with his subplot feeling repetitive.Visually, the film maintains the franchise's signature aesthetic, with picturesque settings and a haunting score by Carter Burwell. However, the CGI, particularly during Bella's pregnancy transformation, is unconvincing and detracts from key moments.The pacing is one of the film's biggest issues. Much of the runtime is spent on drawn-out scenes that could have been condensed. While some fans may appreciate the extended focus on Bella and Edward's relationship, others might find it tedious and lacking in excitement.Breaking Dawn - Part 1 ultimately feels like a prelude stretched too thin, leaving much of the tension and payoff for the second part. It's a film that only die-hard fans of the series might truly enjoy, while casual viewers will likely find it a lackluster addition to the saga.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Some Good Ideas, but Still Awful","Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 follows Bella and Edward as they get married and embark on their honeymoon, only to find new trouble has occurred.There were a handful of parts of this movie that I liked. When characters became unhealthy, they looked unhealthy. They actually looked really good in this particular instance. Otherwise there were a couple ideas that I thought were, although poorly explained at times, pretty cool and unpredictable.Other than that, this movie suffers in almost every way the previous ones did. As per usual, we get some terrible performances from our three main leads. I don't know if I'm getting used to them or what, but I don't mind their acting as much anymore. Except Taylor Lautner, he still sucks big-time. Kristen Stewart was alright though. I think. She wasn't as annoyingly bad at acting as she was in the previous movies at least. Robert Pattinson is still better, but not by much. There was one performance that really stood out to me, however, and that was the one committed by Booboo Stewart. This was seriously one of the worst performances I've ever seen. He reminded me of Kristen Stewart's worst moments from the first movie, but it was all the time. He delivered these extremely clich√© and overused lines with as much personality as a dying boulder. Try to imagine that.I can't tell if the writing still sucks or if I'm used to it, but I think it's gotten better. Not much better, as proved by the lines written for Booboo Stewart's character, but it wasn't so unbearably or hilariously awful as it was previous.The special effects still suck. The wolves themselves look like garbage. And then there was a baby made with CGI for some reason. I remembered hearing about that, but I could not have prepared myself for that. It looked hilariously fake. I loved it. It was probably the best part of the movie.One thing in particular that really confuses me is the fact that everyone keeps saying that if a vampire were to engage in sexual intercourse with a human that it'd be dangerous, and yet I don't recall anyone ever stating why or how, or even stating that until someone just started saying it like everyone already knew it. A handful of other things were poorly or never explained at all, but this was the biggest thing.And the make-up. Normally I wouldn't look at this, but the Cullens were super pale in all the previous movies and now they aren't. They're still pale, but not nearly as pale as before. They actually look human. In the previous movies it was hard to care for these characters because they didn't look real, and in turn they fit the exaggerated character stereotypes that they embodied. Now they look human, yet still maintain these personalities, which makes it hard to take them seriously as characters in a serious movie. They fit better in a Japanese anime than a live-action supposedly serious American movie like this one. Furthermore, the first three movies spent time developing characters that didn't feel or look like people, so in my mind that's exactly what they weren't. And now they're being treated like well-developed characters and it just doesn't work. The sudden shift doesn't make any real sense within the story, but I guess that's what you get with a new director for every movie.Overall Twilight: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 has some good ideas, but it fails on every level the ones before it did. It's like a turd with ice cream on the other side of it. There's some good stuff, but you have to push through the crap to get to it. It's good for a Twilight movie, but that doesn't mean that it's actually good. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No doubt Breaking Dawn part 1 will breaks the records,"I came here to because of the hype over Breaking Dawn now , my whole family want to see Breaking Dawn , i actually work at a movie theater i already watched it The Film itself, was truly epic and emotional From the beginning to the end especially the end , Heart touching Dialogues , emotional acting from the wedding to the birth this one deserves an Oscar the other twilight movies deserved Razzies for the directing . I don't want to give too many plot details away, so I'll end my review here. This film is brilliant, not only the best twilight movie, but possibly the best film of the year. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried during the end",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
really enjoyed this,"I wish this film had been longer to include more of the sense of time passing, as in the book the pregnancy takes a long time - there is also the relationship with Seth & Leah. There weren't any wolf fights in the book, but I guess films feel the need to do visual stuff. A friend disliked the leg shaving scene, but I liked that was left in as Bella was feeling nervous & it was in the book. I liked the time on the island, that gave a sense of how long the honeymoon was. The whole film was under 2 hours, so it's a shame they didn't add a bit more time and settle down more into the being in the house part. I love these books, and it's not for the action - I would be quite happy to not have any action, just see how the people relate to each other. When the wolves turned back to people again they really should have been naked (that would have been quite nice, & more authentic) - but they managed to have loads of clothes on. Oh well, you don't get everything. It would have been nice to see more of the Jacob/Rose hate thing, which was quite funny too. I'm looking forward to part 2 with the beautiful Renesmee - interesting when she's very little. I would really like to see more of the relationships in the house. The book was perfect, so it's a shame to change things about for the film, but I guess they just don't have time to cram so much information in. I'm going to see it again, as I'm sure there are loads of details I missed. I was a bit worried about Kirsten; is she actually that slender? Or was that emaciated look done by computer to show the ravages of the pregnancy?",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bad movie night Sundays week four,"Wow, just wow didn't think it could get worse but they found a way.Just as bad and unwatchable as New Moon. Right up there with the first two Twilight films. Compared to this Eclipse is a four or five out of ten. The only watchable film in this entire saga has been Eclipse.Cringe writing, cringe dialogue, and an absolute boring story. They took whatever could have peeked my interest from Eclipse and threw it out the window with this film. Everyone is terrible in this film, *points to Alice* except you Alice you're doing great.The silver lining here, there's only one more left then I'll be done with this cringefest of a saga.

Episode IV - The Last Cringe (Part 1),"A wedding and a pregnancy, that's all this is. It takes almost two hours, to have a wedding and a pregnancy. Granted, with lame vampires and underwhelming werewolves.Why oh why does it take a whole two hours to accomplish what happens in this movie? Marriage, pregnancy, consequences, that's basically all that happens, no overarching Michael Sheen in this one to keep it as a somewhat compelling drama. In my eyes, this could've been a wedding montage, a slightly more rushed version of the pregnancy segment of the movie, and combined with a slightly more rushed 'Part 2'. Then you've got a three hour adaptation of Breaking Dawn. It's probably not gonna be much better, but it'll end it all a hell of a lot quicker. The acting has once again improved by a minuscule percentage, Alice, Charlie and Carlisle remain stand-outs. Bella, Edward and Jacob have a much more believable relationship with one another, regardless of the consistently bad dialogue.Such a shell of a larger story with content that leaves you feeling empty, dreading the conclusion of Breaking Dawn and 'The Twilight Saga' rather than anticipating it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No Spoilers... It stays true to the book in essence,"Well i must say i wasn't expecting much as its a ""part 1"" release but i think i would have it no other way because of the amount of extra freedom the producers had for detail and it stuck to the main plot line of the book with no alterations (i think thanks to Stephenie Meyer being a producer) So to all the awesome people who read the book you wont be disappointed in the film adaptation and to all the people who saw the previous Twilight saga movies this one was made much better in every way, the only sucky thing about it is the whole to be continued ending as it kills the mood but that is the industry known to you as Hollywood ever so awesome and cruel at the same time -_-",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bill did a good job,"I love the books and enjoy the movies. I felt they did a good job for the most part, the only scene I felt was real cheesy was the werewolf scene between Jacob and Sam. But how else would you do it? It was pretty much the was it was in the book. I understand why they had Jacob, Seth, and Leah in human form most the time, but missed how it was written. They had Bella looking so bad, but again that's how she was described. I would have liked a little more of the Rosalie and Jacob animosity, it was always so funny in the book, my favorite was the dog bowl scene, wish it was in the movie. Over all I enjoyed it very much and can't wait for the next one.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breaking Dawn Part 1 is the best one so far!,"BREAKING DAWN IS BY FAR THE BEST ONE IN THE SAGA YET. Bill Condon is a GENIUS! I was able to watch the movie on Monday 14th at the Black Carpet World Premiere in Los Angeles. Now let me tell you that watching the movie amongst 7000+ in attendance is a complete adrenaline rush. You could feel everyone emotions while the movie was playing plus knowing that the stars and Stephenie Meyer were in attendance and could hear our cheers just felt good. Having one tissue was not enough for the complete movie to wipe my tears of happiness. I know now when I go see it tonight once again, to take a box of tissues with me. Breaking Dawn Part 1 is one of the few movies I've watch throughout the years that I can say is just like the book. There is not one moment or scene I would take out or change. Now that I've seen the movie I'm glad they did break it up into two parts because I can't see it being done any other way after seeing the movie Monday. All the favorite elements from the book are in the movie, pus some new elements that work perfectly with what we know from the books too.I'm not going to describe the story since we pretty much have all read the book and know what happens. I won't spoil anything either since it will be worth the wait just a few more hours to see it tonight or tomorrow. How they end Part 1 is how I always expected they would. Even though I expected it , it was still incredible to watch it on the big screen. Jacob's imprinting will win you over if you haven't been on Team Jacob ever. Taylor killed it with the scene. Kristen was the one character throughout the movie that impressed me the most. I haven't been her number one fan but after her representation of Bella in Breaking Dawn, I'm am a FAN! Kristen does a phenomenal job with her part. You feel all her emotions throughout the movie. Robert as Edward continues to great also. Like I mention this movie is by far the best of all of them, I can't even imagine what part 2 will bring.What did I enjoy the best from the whole movie? This is the one that felt the most realistic. What do I mean by that. Well the characters interaction with one another. Bella and Edward show a side that we haven't seen before, its like watching yourself with your husband or boyfriend. Its that playfulness that couples share. Even the fighting between then was so realistic, it didn't feel like a script. I honestly could gush all day about how Epic Breaking Dawn Part 1 is. I'm so excited to go again tonight with my mom and live through the wedding and honeymoon once again. Tomorrow I can't wait to read all the comments of those that went tonight to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie,"If you like the previous movies you will probably like this. But if you did'nt like the others then why even bother seeing this and argue about it being bad and so on???? Don't get that. I never se a move that I know i don't like, why should I??Now over to the movie. I found it very good and I will definitely see it again. A little more predictable than the first three but for being the fourth movie in in a series, it was very good.So my recommendation:1 - If you like twilight, go see it. 2 - If you don't like Twilight, go see something else. 3 - If you have never seen twilight before, see the other three first and then follow step 1 or 2.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

(shouting) Do not listen to critics!,"DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO ANYTHING THE CRITICS SAY!!! They don't like this movie simply because they haven't read it (they don't understand whats going on) and they also have nothing better to do with their time but write negative reviews about something they have know idea what they are talking about. Besides, do critics ever write positive reviews? Hardly ever. That's why they are called critics. So don't just pass on this movie just because of what these people who are out of their mind are saying about it. Give it a chance . I just have to say, if you haven't read this book you will probably not fully understand whats going on or fully enjoy it. I have read it many times and I was thrilled with every moment of this movie. It is absolutely perfect. And to those who hate that it is in two parts don't understand why it is. The book is enormous and if it was all in one movie, it would simply suck. There is too much going on for one movie (contrary to what critics say). Anyone who has read it will love it. If you haven't, then you may not get it. I am just sick and tired of all the stupid people in the world who hated this movie. Get a grip people!

what's wrong with the critics ? they can't write one post without insulting the actors and the film !,"It was GREAT!! Probably the greatest after Twilight! 1. Bill's direction was the best, if not second best after Catherine's. 2. The script was definitely the best of them all. 3. Kristen gives the best performance of the four movies. From being nervous to get married, to being completely in bliss, to trying to keep her baby. She was phenomenal. 4. The sex scene were very very sensual but didn't go all the way to sexual. It was really good, I wasn't disappointed but I wanted more. I hope we get to see more on the DVD. I think the scene where they start to have sex for the second time was hotter than the actual sex scene. 5. I loved the scene with her in the black nightie! Rob was so funny. 6. I thought the wedding was going to be a big extravaganza, but it was actually somehow discreet, and very very sweet, especially in the vows and when they kiss after that it was amazing, and with the song playing! 7. A good surprise was the nightmare Bella's having before the wedding where she is dressed as a bride and everyone is wearing white. To be honest I liked the way she looked in the dream wedding more than the actual one. 8. The scene where they hear the baby for the first time and then they cuddle on the couch was the cutest scene ever!! Ever!!! And I loved the fact that they made it just about Bella and Edward and not with Rosalie and Jacob too, like it was in the book. It was an amazing moment! 9. I know we have all been waiting for the sex scene, but I think the birth scene eventually stole the show. It was really powerful and I found myself actually terrified and worried about what would happen even if I knew! Kristen looked completely terrifying and they had a lot of close ups at the scene where she is dead. Rob gave his best Twilight performance ever in that scene, where Bella dies. He was just desperate!! And you could see how desperate he was! He was mesmerizing!! And I loved it when he called her ""baby""! I thought it would sound wrong for Edward if he ever called her baby, but it sounded so right at that moment saying ""come to me baby please"" so desperately! 10. I loved the fact that they did not try to stick to the lines of the book. They did that in Eclipse. Months after seeing Eclipse I realized that it had a bad script, because they tried to bring the exact lines of the book to the movie. Fortunately that didn't happen in this one, so it gave more room to the actors to act better, all of them. I think we should congratulate Bill Condon not only for the direction but also for contributing and making a better script. 11. The toasts: funniest scene in the movie. Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick were hilarious!! And I loved how they showed that scene. One toast after the other. 12. The one scene I hated was the wolves talking to each other in their wolf form. Wasn't that weird? It was like robots trying to have a conversation.Overall it's the most mature Twilight, and probably competes with the first one to be the best. To be honest I wasn't very satisfied with New Moon and Eclipse, they just never exactly did it for me. But with Breaking Dawn I was 100% satisfied and well done Mr. Condon! Very nice job!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
4 years spanning,"On November 21, 2008, we were introduced to a whole new world of the supernatural ‚Äì vampires and the occasional love between a vampire and a mortal.

Forgive me...I actually really enjoyed this!,"I'm what you could call half-twihard. I loved the first two books, barely remember reading Eclipse and when it came to Breaking Dawn that book was one that (to quote Dorothy Parker), ""Should not be tossed aside lightly but thrown with great force"". I never even finished the 4th book it disgusted me so much.At about 9:45 last night I bit the bullet and bought a ticket to the latest in this saga. I was half-expecting to walkout on this film as I had HATED the film Eclipse.My first surprise was when I was in the sold-out theater and there were A LOT of women (and men) my age and older in the seats. I was expecting teen pandemonium but nope, I got thirtysomethings having a girl's (Moms?) night out. Whoops were kept to a minimum. I think some parents might be trying to protect their wee ones from this last movie.Of course we had to watch 25 mins worth of previews beforehand, but I digress.All that I had been dreading...actually kept me glued to the screen. The humor was present, whether intentional or not. Thank god for Billy Burke (Charlie Swan) to still be the comic relief in this film and keep it grounded in reality when there was time.Kristen Stewart has finally grown some confidence in her character, Bella, and for once, she didn't totally suck. She actually acted. How sad is that that I didn't like the lead until 4 movies into the saga?There was implied rough sex, violence, and gore but NOT as gory as the birthing scene in the book. That I still haven't forgiven Stephanie Meyer for. Her way of writing of the birthing process would have scared me senseless if I was 12. In the movie, it worked.The other thing I was dreading...how the heck are they going to pull off Jacob imprinting on Renesmee? I was shocked to see that was actually done well and it knocked all the previous pedophilia jokes out.This movie is really only for the fans though. I can't imagine what a newbie would make of this series.I won't be buying the soundtrack though. The score was fine and all but the artists they used did so not fit into my usual twilight playlist. It was jarring at times what they picked and just plain bad. New Moon still wins for best soundtrack, in my opinion, in capturing the mood of one of those films. That and there is no new Muse song out for this latest soundtrack (blasphemy!). Then again Neutron Star Collision was quite awful.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

brilliant,"When I read Breaking Dawn for the first time I loved it. It was shocking and chaotic and I couldn't believe the author could take it in such a bizarrely perverse direction. But in no way did I think any of the novel's real gruesomeness would make it to the screen in the squeaky clean series. Well i'm happy to say that I was so off my game and happily so. Breaking Dawn pt. one is everything you have been hoping for in these adaptations. The characters are fully drawn finally with solid performances to match. Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson are at their best and Taylor Lautner is finally really good. The film is directed wonderfully by Oscar winner Bill Condon of Dreamgirls and Of Gods and Monsters. The film is always engaging, interesting, funny, clever and even a little terrifying. How this film escaped without an R rating I just don't know the sex scenes are pretty impressive but is nothing compared to the grotesque birthing sequence only briefly outlined in the book but much more effective here. The film is powered by potent melodrama as usual but it's much more effective this time around creating an atmosphere of utter suspense. Now there will no doubt be haters as usual, and maybe even more so because this is such a bizarrely perverse and darkly wonderful film. But it is without a doubt the best of the series and one of the best films I've ever seen. I'd also like to say that Kristen Stewart be commended for her utter dedication to the role. She looks sickly and completely immerses herself in it. It's quite striking with a film too match. Brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A must for True Twilight fans,"Okay so yes there are plenty of haters out there and what I would like to ask them is why are you going to see this movie if you hate the franchise so much??? No one is being forced from where I am standing.I was very pleasantly surprised I thought the wedding was tastefully done and the romance just right. The honeymoon was much more than I expected after hearing how the wedding night scene was cut to meet pg13 standards.The three leads were the best in the series so far, strong performances all round with clear evidence of a good director and someone who actually took time to understand the story and know what the audience wanted. Well done Bill Condon.For almost two hours I was swept away into a fantasy world where the vampires sparkle and the werewolves talk. The easiness of one Mr Pattinson on the eye helps but I still think the film was well worth the wait and did justice to what could have been a very awkward version of a book being translated to film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twilight Saga Breaking dawn part 1,Well this movie doesn't deserve a low rating at all. The director of this film did an amazing job. He tied in lots of things that none of the other directors did and kept to the book. For the whole guys aspect of there not being enough fighting... Well the first part of the book doesn't have a whole lot of fighting and the fight scenes that are in the movie didn't happen but I give the director credit for trying to reach out to the male fan bass. Over all they did an amazing job from getting the wedding to look exactly how it was described to making Bella look like a walking skeleton. Looking forward to watching part two :),10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I just like it,"I guess that most of the reviewers giving criticisms never read the book. Although this movie dropped a lot of stuffs in the book, at least it shows the most important parts of it. I can't think a better way to film the book. It contains a lot of thoughts and feelings which are very hard to present in a movie. But they have done their best. If you are looking for an action movie, just don't see this one. You can't blame the movie because there is no violence or actions in it, otherwise it is not twilight. I also like the soundtrack in this one, they adopted the original music from the first twilight movie, which is also my favourite in the series of twilight movies. Overall, I am glad the movie is going back to the romantic way and closer to the original book.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
epic !!,"I don't usually review twilight titles although I'm one of the biggest fans Like many others, I'm a twilight fan and i've loved every single movie released. The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn part 1 is the most unforgettable, remarkable, and amazing movie out of the four , Breaking Dawn beats twilight , new moon and eclipse together , in my opinion its the greatest Twilight film . I would never complain about how the movie did not have enough 'details' because that it just something impossible to do without exceeding the runtime and also losing many audience who haven't read the book. By far, this is the greatest movie based on the Twilight series and after seeing this, one feels proud to have stuck with Twilight till the end. Watch it over and over again. It deserves nothing less. Bill Condon did an amazing job in this movie. rate +A",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breaking Dawn Steps it Up,"So, I went to see the new Twilight movie this afternoon, and I have to say it has to be the best of the bunch. I'm truly not a Twittard or whatever you call those sad moms who wear Edward tees and scream Robert Pattinson's name whenever they catch the fancy, but I thought it was overall one of the best productions in this franchise thus far.The acting was much better by Kristen Stewart, who I'd previously judged to be a good child actor and a sub-par to bad adult actor. Direction, editing, and comic relief was also a step-up as well. I was pleasantly surprised with the lightheartedness and obvious demonstration that they truly don't take themselves too seriously, especially with the more ridiculous parts that most book fans rejected. Case in point, Bella's questionable baby name choices.I was a bit shocked by what they did end up showing their mostly pre- teen audience, but I think they did stay true to the book as much as possible. The true test on whether this was entertainment gold for me is the amount of times I caught myself glancing at my watch or being distracted by the odd passerby. Test passed, and was I was actually kinda PO'd that it ended when it did, even though I already knew they were splitting the last book up into two movies. The worst part of this movie, as you can imagine, is that we now have to wait another year to watch the rest. Oy' vey, but I'm sure it will be well worth the wait, or as Roger Ebert so elegantly puts it, if it isn't, Charlie Swan has a gun and he knows how to use it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exactly as I've seen it between the lines...,"I always thought I am among the fans of Meyer's book rather then the Saga movies. I have been thinking this way till today... My opinion has been changed by the director that made a huge job to vitalize the final book of the Saga. Of course, the movie doesn't reflect it in details, but there is no need in it. More precise conformity with the author would kill the film. Actually, the movie is a more reality-like version of the book then I could imagine. I was smiling while reading in previous reviews: ""Bella looked terrible"" and ""the scene of Renesme's delivery was horrible"" ... Only innocent or very young people that have never gave a birth or seen the act of delivery could write those words. Bella was lucky because it was horrible and very quick. Not many woman can consider themselves lucky cause in reality it IS horrible and VERY VERY long...and you have no fashion-magazine-cover-look at that moment.))",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I loved every bit of Breaking Dawn,"I think Bill Condon did a terrific job. It's also the bloodiest, most gruesome, squirm-inducing entry in the series thus far. And Kristen Stewart portrayed the perfect Bella. Breaking Dawn is about Bella and Edward's love story and their intense passion for each other. Ones who think that the movie wasn't good. Well.uh, one advise. Please read the books first. The beginning of the end ultimately delivers a wow factor. And I loved Rob and Kristen's acting. And yes I was in tears at the end of birth scene. yeah about lesson twilight gives. Yeah it shows love, passion and dedication for your partner. The support your family gives you. Bella's intense love for the child who was killing her. Friendship... Its just that now this world is full of hatred that you guys have developed. yeah what does hating TWILIGHT could possibly give you?",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perfect for Twiligters,"OK - this movie is NOT going to get an Oscar. It is not going to go on any official list of best movies ever made. However, if you loved the books, this film will likely hit the spot for you. The Twilight novels are largely cerebral. There is some action and adventure but the meat of the story is what's going on in the characters' heads - their emotions, their relationships, their senses. This is all hard to translate into film and I think this movie does a great job of doing that. There are scenes that could come across as corny or too maudlin. The film makers do a terrific job of re-interpreting those scenes (the honeymoon for one) with just the right touch of humor. This isn't the movie to see if you want to see some potential Academy award film but if you enjoyed the books and want to see the story come to life, pack up your sense of humor, leave the mighty expectations at home and just have some fun watching Bella finally get her vampire!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Crazy good CGI from a movie only the fans will appreciate,"I watched this again when I stumbled across it on my TV and couldn't turn it off. This is just such a guilty pleasure.Pretty much only fans of the series will like this as here we finally get the wedding in all its glory, including (unnecessary) close ups of the dress, jewelry and even Stephanie Meyer as a guest. And then finally Bella and Edward get down to business, with the much anticipated feathers and even a broken headboard. -More than I was expecting from the love scenes actually.Of course then things go rapidly downhill for our couple and I have to say the special effect are pretty mind blowing. I mean it becomes a true horror movie as we watch Bella transform, losing a good 40 lbs (via CGI) as her fetus (sorry baby) destroys her from the inside out. And that birth scene, jeez, talk about gory.They also dealt with the (creepy) imprinting issue well too, using a visions of the future aspect for Jacob. Nov21/12",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Epic and absolutely perfect....not a disappointment!,"I understand that people have their opinions on what they think about the movie. Do not let them change your mind about anything or persuade you to not see this movie. I am a major Twilight fan, and I have read all the books, so I was blown away with what they managed to do with this movie. It obviously had to be rated PG-13, and I truly believe that they couldn't have done any better with the rating that they had to work with. It was perfect. The acting did seem way better than it has before, especially with Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart. Their chemistry is HOT! They are definitely believable as a married couple in love. I think this is the best performance that Kristen has ever done in the series. Her deteriorating state during Bella's pregnancy, and the love she has for her unborn baby, as well as for Edward is so strong. I have never seen her better. She shined in this movie. Rob's acting was phenomenal, also the best I've seen in the series. He shows how broken Edward is about Bella's health during her pregnancy, and how it is torturing him. He shows Edward as finally giving emotions, from happy, to sad and broken, the emotion was clearly there. The birthing scene was EPIC!!! Totally amazing! And the way that it ended, I called it! Exactly how I knew it would happen! All and all, truly amazing and I cannot wait to see how they made Part 2!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
amazing the best twilight film,"i saw it yesterday, and i already want to see it again when the wedding scene was over i already wanted to see it again, same for the honeymoon.. it's amazing i love how rob and Kristen played their role! they are beautiful! the only one i didn't like is the dance with Jacob at the wedding,an how she is happy about it at first and later when she speaks to Charly and says that ""it's not the same anymore"" about her love..it's heartbreaking he end with Bella transforming and rob trying to save her is heartbreaking too..ho my.. Kristen and rob's chemistry was amazing its really amazing , i've never liked the others twilight films but to be honest the critics are lame and mean i mean saying Breaking Dawn the worst twilight film is like saying New moon is the best twilight film ! at the end of the film everyone was saying that it was amazing so the critics can go die already ANYWAYS, i LOVE it! i'm so proud of them an thank you Bill ! story B , acting B- , directing B+ , effect +C i'm not a twilight fan and actually i became a twilight fan :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A must see!,"I thought the movie was excellent! I'm not just saying that because i'm a girl and i'm crazy over the saga, i really did enjoy the movie from start to finish. I think if you haven't read the books and you go to watch the movies then you are really missing out. You need to understand the love and connections between each character to really enjoy the film, i thought the acting was much better and the overall atmosphere of the film improved greatly.One thing i would say to the males (since that's who the majority of the votes give 1/10) is that Twilight is like a teenage girls fantasy, just like you have superhero's like batman and iron man. Girls generally have a fantasy of romance rather than action and i think twilight is one of the few films out there for teenage girls which really delivers that.Also I've got to disagree with those who say that the movie was stretched out far more than necessary. Twilight fans WANT every scene from the book in the movie and although everything wasn't in, i think the film catered to its fans superbly. If they rushed through the scenes then that would be catering to the people who don't really like twilight not the fans.I would say the movie definitely did the first half of the book justice and most of the important scenes that twihards love are in there (although i did want to see the rivalry between Jacob and Rosalie). Overall an excellent film and i highly recommend everyone that likes twilight to go and see it, and everyone who doesn't or are in two minds about twilight, go read the books then watch it and you'll understand how great it really is!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Excellent, perfect, worth seeing multiple times, WOW!","Anyone who doesn't think this film was a home run, either isn't a fan of the series or just doesn't have an ounce of romance in their body. This absolutely was the second best yet (Twilight being the first). Bella and Edward's journey couldn't have been shown any different and Bill Condon went right to the heart of it and did a brilliant job of bringing it to fruition. This movie will be seen by this fan at least a half dozen times or more. The emotion and sacrifice and love they brought to Bella and Edward were what had me reading Breaking Dawn over and over. I have always loved seeing and reading about epic love stories and this one, by far, has exceeded all expectations. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
i'm dreaming or something ? finally a real VAMPIRES/Werewolves movie,"I just saw this movie last night and wanted to take a few before saying anything on it. It is a very moving and powerful movie that shows the power of loss and love This is a great one , this is the best twilight so far the haters can say what ever they want i don't give a .... this movie amazing i thought eclipse was the best one but no breaking dawn is the best , mix of romance and horror at the same time also the acting was great from Rob and Kristen . Taylor Lautner was pretty good in the beginning but he failed almost in the whole movie , Kristen did an amazing job in this movie she was so emotional and very very good even the haters should admit it . especially at the birth although this movie got some critics from some clueless reviewers like the potter-fans that have no idea about the movie . this is why i hated Harry Potter because the critics are so fair with Harry potter but when its came to twilight this gave the movies 0/10 like always , this proves that they got paid to hate on every twilight movie actually i read the reviews in RT and then i went to see the movie with a bad idea about it because of them but this time they failed i really enjoyed the movie and i give it A+ and i'm a guy , this is the best twilight despite the critics .. congratulation for Bill and the twilight fans and the cast",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Bella gets married, gives birth..and turns into vampire...you should know that already!","It was awesome! I didn't care too much for New Moon or Eclipse. Of course I liked them because I am a fan but I really felt that they were not as good as the first one. But Breaking Dawn P1 has really turned out tons better than those two. It is a MUST see for all fans and I cannot wait to see P2!It contained not just the juicy love stuff that we fans like to see but it had some great hostility and tension in it which was natural and expected. It followed the book as best as possible. I just wish that it had left scenes in it to actually follow the book more. Unfortunately there are too many teenie boppers out there so they felt that they had to keep it as clean as possible which SUCKED. That was probably the worst thing about the movie.I loved how it ended..it ended just where I thought it would and it all came together, flowed nicely and it was down right awesome!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
amazing and not far from Perfect,I have seen this movie twice. I liked it MUCH better the first time because I watched all the Twilight movies before this one and it affected me so much... The second time I saw it was great but not as powerful. It was not just because I have already seen it i saw it at a private screening last night Kristen and Robert's acting was outstanding but Taylor Lautner was a little Disappointing at the birth scene and i'm team Jacob by the wayFirst time viewing: 10/10Second time viewing: 9/10You MUST watch the rest as well.

Bill Condon makes Breaking Dawn part 1 almost better than the book , even thought some critics say its sucks but i read some of them actually they have NO idea about the whole story except the pregnancy , they are paid to hate on twilight they just read the Wiki of Breaking Dawn and then they criticized the movie without mention anything about the great acting and the amazing directing so the critics are lame don't take them too seriously",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rating: 3 out of 5 (4 out of 5 for fans),"Cast: Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson, Taylor Lautner, Peter Facinelli, Elizabeth Reaser, Nikki Reed, Billy Burke, Sarah Clarke, Kellan Lutz, Anna Kendrick.Parents' guide: Implied sex, violence, bloody birth.MONTREAL - After what seemed like an eternity spent in adolescent limbo, the Twilight series grows up, sort of, in Breaking Dawn Part 1.The fourth film in the series ‚Äì the first in the two-part final chapter, the second of which will be released a year from now ‚Äì ties up a lot of loose ends that had been lingering over the three earlier instalments. And it offers some major plot developments while leaving room for more.Not a lot happens in the film, but what does is major. It can be summed up in three words: marriage, sex, pregnancy. You know, typical vampire movie fare.Yes, Bella (Kristen Stewart) and Edward (Robert Pattinson) finally tie the knot. And in true Twilight fashion, their union is treated with plenty of romantic clich√©s and drawn-out melodrama.It begins with an invitation. Jacob (Taylor Lautner) receives his and is not amused. The buildup to the big day is shown with ample attention to detail ‚Äì breaking in heels, hair and makeup, heirlooms passed down, all to a sweeping classical soundtrack.But not everything is perfect. Previously certain of her feelings, Bella begins to have doubts ‚Äì and bad dreams ‚Äì about tying the knot with the undead. Needless to say, she forges ahead.The wedding is treated with swoon-inducing sensitivity. As Bella prepares to be escorted down the aisle by her father, Charlie (Billy Burke), the camera pauses on her nervous face, her hair clip, her neck, her veil and the intricate design of her dress plunging down her back. Don't get me started on the kiss.There are amusing speeches (mercifully edited into a snappy montage), dancing and just enough dramatic tension (cue Jacob) to let us know that this is not going to be all fun and games. But there is a little fun and games.Which brings us to the honeymoon. Edward goes all out, sweeping his bride off to Rio, Brazil, then a quiet island where they can be alone.All is picture-perfect, right down to the nuptial bed that awaits them, beckoning. After three films of foreplay, Bella and Edward are ready to consummate their love. The results, while far from raunchy, are surprisingly suggestive; let's just say the Earth shakes.The blissful tone takes a turn in the second half, as director Bill Condon gets a chance to show his dark side. Pregnant with what, no one's sure, exactly, Bella turns a ghastly shade of pale. The rest of the film is devoted to keeping her alive as the beast within grows, and gets thirsty.A dutiful action sequence breaks the adult vibe with some cartoonishly animated battles with wolves. But when all is said and done, Twilight makes a necessary quantum leap forward, while managing to end on a suspenseful note that neatly sets us up for one more round. Speaking of which, fans are advised to stay in their seats for a mid-credit teaser of what's in store for next time.tdunlevy@montrealgazette.com",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent Interpretation of the Book,"Due to the complexities of the book this film contained not only action sequences with the usual dose of teenage angst, but also contained a fair amount of humour. It was believable, enjoyable and a true interpretation of the first half of the book. The only criticism I would make is that there was not enough explanation in some parts for those who had not read the book, particularly with regard to imprinting. My husband, who has seen the other films but not read the books, had to ask me to clarify the plot on this point. The cinematography was good and in general it was all very enjoyable although the scene with the wolves talking at once did not work for me. I can see what the director was going for, but it did not come off well with the result that the scene was a bit confusing. It ended at a good point and did not leave me feeling frustrated that it had come to a premature finish. Perhaps my favourite of all of the Twilight films so far and enjoyed by the family and friends, who had mostly not read the book, that joined me. Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is my favorite movie thus far,"I live with a romantic person who is the complete opposite of me and we hardly see or think the same way but we both AGREED this movie was romantic and the dynamics of how love can be was definitely seen again in this movie. There were deviations from the book but not enough to take away at all from the story. I think it explained things very well if you haven't read the book(s). I loved the ""theatrics"" added to the story. Made the movie funny in certain parts also helped to explain the tension in other parts. This is the best movie in the series so far for me. New Moon was first now it's second place. Breaking Dawn is my favorite book in the series. I was extremely pleased with this movie! I've got to see it again!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Also visually beautiful found it to be the best installment of the Twilight Saga. This is a love story not an action film. I think a couple of the previous directors forgot that fact.It had a good cross section of both. Bill Condon understood how important these moments were for the Twilight audience.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
loved it...,I read all these reviews and I don't get it. Whats not to like its like the story with a few minor details left out. I mean if your expecting to see the titanic its not going to happen. Its a teenage romance really and if your not much of a romantic and like to poke fun at that kind of stuff you won't like this. However that being said I loved it. It wasn't over done in my opinion and they kept it as close to the novel as possible. I was only sad that the opening scene didn't have that amazing car like in the book lol. I thought the dialoge was really entertaining. Everyone in the theater was laughing and even clapped at the end. If you love the books you should watch it. Even if you don't and like movies like lost boys you'll really like it. Don't go in expecting to see The Kings Speech lol....

A Nutshell Review: Breaking Dawn Part 1,"One cannot deny that Twilight smells of serious money, and following the Harry Potter film franchise had its final book split into two for that extra injection into the coffers. But I had to admit that Breaking Dawn Part 1 isn't as dreadful as the other two films that followed the first film, since they were essentially rehashing a lot of the same themes with Bella (Kristen Stewart) still being indecisive about whether she prefers the vampire or thw wolf, and finally made up her mind here in marrying one of them right from the start.And oh the fuss about what Bella is wearing for her wedding, and how a vampire can consummate a wedding is all but answered in this installment, I think. Inviting friends and family and plenty of other support characters appearing over the course of the three films so far whom you probably care less about, a union between a man and a woman spelt a heartbreak for werewolf Jacob (Taylor Lautner), who disappeared for the most part, but not before tearing off his shirt to offer Team Jacob fans a glimpse of his rock hard abs before a half a movie absence. So Edward (Robert Pattinson) and Bella journey to Brazil and to its offshore island to make love, and Stephanie Meyer's imagination with award winning director Bill Condon's vision explains how powerful a vampire's orgasm can be.In which case Edward decides to stay celibate thereafter knowing his pleasure equates to Bella's physical pain, until they found out that they had never thought to use contraceptives. After all, an undead producing seeds for offspring? One has to get past that plot point, with nary an explanation, in order for Breaking Dawn to work. As a teen movie, at least it got it right to have its main characters abstain from sex until marriage, but seriously family planning was never part of any serious discussion between Edward and Bella, adopting very common attitudes such as ""it'll never happen to us"". Well, guess what?Reality quickly sinks in post-honeymoon stage especially when the couple faces a huge problem, in this case the disbelief that Bella can get pregnant (Wolf boy is still a virgin, so no hanky panky here...) and the decision whether or not to keep the baby since it's growing at an accelerated pace, and could be a half human half vampire monster, eating his mom from the inside out. Research shows the baby will be born through the breaking of all critical bones in the human body, so therein lies the existential dilemma - keep the baby and the mom dies, or kill the baby so that mom lives. Plenty of excellent soul searching stuff here by humans, vampires and wolves with the latter determined not to let something unknown threaten their very survival and existence.Compared to the other earlier films, I grudgingly admit this one boasted better makeup, especially in making Kristen Stewart look really ghastly and unappealing, and kudos to the actress to have had that bit of makeup and prosthetics assist her in dealing with the emotions and mood swings that come with pregnancy. This book was a little bit more mature in its dealing with heavier themes, and Condon found the right balance in introducing those themes without being overbearing or preachy about. For that, credit has to go where credit is deserved, and as an emotional journey, well this one was quite the relief given what audiences had to endure from the earlier films, but that still doesn't make this a romantic masterpiece, lacking in genuine emotion and feeling.For the fans of Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner split into two different camps, well unfortunately your pretty boys didn't fare as well as the lass this time, turning from friends to foes to friends and back again so very often, you'd start to wonder just exactly who was being wishy-washy. Robert Pattinson seemed to have the least to do here, and became rather pedestrian, while Taylor Lautner's pedigree wolf bloodline sees him relegated to being just a guard dog outside of the Cullins family home in the forest and being told to get out when he snuck into the house without invitation, and who is to know he had actually held the key to short-changing the audience from one big finale battle between the wolf clan and the Cullens.For completeness sake I will be watching the next concluding episode of the film so as to achieve closure. The dialogue in this one's pretty horrendous, the acting rather bland and has a soundtrack full of pop music and ballads that nobody's actively listening to. The most gruesome scene involves a makeshift operating table and the much talked about child birth, but trust me it was quite aesthetically and tastefully (pardon the pun) done without over- reliance on shock tactics. Adopting the expected, logical cliffhanger knowing what's next in store for Bella, the concluding film won't open until a year from now, and it's a tall order, but I'm really hoping for a fruitful conclusion.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Possibly the BEST movie for fans.  NOT so great for non-fans.,"Non-fans will find this movie slow, and even boring. However, for the fans of the series, this is definitely one of the best. It fulfills all of their most important wishes, and does so with style and great beauty.Fans will walk out feeling warm and happy. Non-fans will wonder why nothing is happening, and why it is important. So everyone should expect that there will be a very great dichotomy of opinion about this movie, depending on which group is evaluating it.I'm a guy, who read the books and enjoyed them, despite their obvious (though unimportant) flaws, but I wouldn't be at such an early showing if it weren't for my wife. Yet, because of my understanding of the books, I can see the beauty of how this was done.If you liked the books, or like the movies, then go see this. You will enjoy it and find that it moves you. But don't be surprised that many many people won't 'get it' because EVERY bit of the ""real"" (non-emotional) action is being saved for the final movie in the series.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best yet,"I have read every single book I have watched every single movie. This is to the book. If you don't like the book do me a favor and don't watch the movie because you will not appreciate it. You may not like Kristen or Robert but don't kill the directors hard work but dis-liking and smearing the rating. Simply just move on and leave this fan base alone to give it its comments good or bad. My review of how well this movie did to represent the book was superb against all the other movies. By breaking it up into two parts they in fact stayed with the books story completely. The actors did their job perfectly in their roles. Graphics were amazing, very detailed and time well spent. As an actor/actress they are assigned a role if they keep to their role and give the same affect as it is portrayed they did their job. Its all about the completeness of the movie different factors can turn down the move or rave it up. To me this was a hole-in-one. Can't wait to see the next one.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
STUNNING view of the actual NOVEL to BIGSCREEN! NON SPOILER!,"I am not one to write reviews, as READING most reviews of movies I personally enjoy eventually hurt my own feelings and makes me feel foreign. I love things out of the norm, and seeing as though TWILIGHT NOVEL fans have taken to the actual motion pictures, I feel I am safe to speak my mind in a (mostly) unbiased community.BREAKING DAWN 1 was EVERYTHING it grew itself out to be and was EXPECTED to be as a NOVEL FAN. Granted some subtle yet powerful moments from the novel was left out(""puppies"" lol), I'm crossing my fingers that it may be some part of the DVD special features. However, the in-depth descriptions of some chapters were relayed BEAUTIFULLY through camera and script. The fight sequences, the 'love' scenes, the anger, the wolfy inner-dialogue, the humor, the hate, color, birth, imprinting, death, rebirth, BURNING, etc. I STILL get goosebumps reminiscing the movie I JUST saw as opposed to the book I have held close. I had read Breaking Dawn over and over again the past couple years JUST to get my fix (never dare call me NUTS, its better than doping up, neh?). THIS MOVIE...... DOES NOT DISAPPOINT. My family friend described it as ""EPIC"". I WISH I had a better word!!! Those who disagree have NOT read or liked the books. I pity you. I'm HUNGRY to see it again, and HUNGRY for MORE!!!!!!!

By far the best,"I'll start out by saying I'm a fairly decent fan of the books, and I've read Breaking Dawn about half a dozen times. The first three movies left me utterly disappointed. Kristen Stewart's acting was never very tolerable and Robert Pattinson, while I've always thought to be a decent actor, just sucks as Edward. Though maybe that's because I cannot stand the character. But Breaking Dawn Pt One caught be by surprise. Stewart's acting in this film surpasses the other three immensely. Bella and Edward's relationship has much more emotion in this one, as well. The wedding and reception scenes were sweet but light-hearted and had their funny moments. From the honeymoon on, though, we see a dark twist and the movie gets good. Bella's transformation from normal teenage girl to sickly mother of a vampire spawn is pretty intense. They do a great job of making her look like she's at the end of her life. The birth scene was a little disappointing, but what happens after Edward pulls his daughter out of his new wife is what really shocked some people. Bella's death was the most intense scene out of all four movies. This scene is what pushed me to give this movie a decent rating. She truly does look disturbing.Overall, I enjoyed the movie. And I was surprisingly satisfied with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The most sober vampire movie ever made!!,"Breaking Dawn was the best novel in the Twilight series penned by Stephanie Mayer and as I found out a little while ago Twilight Sage - Breaking Dawn Part-I might be the best movie of the lot till date. The hallmark of Twilight series is the simplicity of the plot with a great emphasis on romance, and with generous bits of vampires and werewolves thrown in together. As a Harry Potter aficionado I at first didn't like the overtly simple tone of the novels (I still think Twilight would have turned into a work of art had a writer of J.K Rowling's caliber worked on it)but the intrigues of the Bella, Edward and Jacob trinity finally roped me in.As any reader would know the movie starts with Bella and Edward getting married. I have seen a lot of movie weddings but I think this one would take the cake. The wedding scenes were simply spectacular and so was the locales selected for shooting. I could see the ladies in the theater practically drooling as the sight of such magnificence. Its a girl's dream come true - marrying the man of their dreams in a fantasy wedding and honeymoon and getting an awesome family too - At 18??. Which girl doesn't dream of it (or so my wife says).Then the drama started. The kids did some acting for a change. I am not saying that I saw Brando,Pacino and Hepburn in action here but given the storyline and tween premise of the movie I would say they did well. Lets give them credit. They have been playing these characters for a while now. Anyway, I wouldn't give away the story as I am sure a lot of non-readers would be watching the movie so I ask them to go and find out for themselves. Anybody can sense that part two will be a lot more action packed as I think the book envisages a Deathly Hallows and The Return of the King kind of finale. Its not in the 'Godfather' category but I'm sure even non-fans will not begrudge some praise for this one. Its a couple of hours of solid entertainment(even in the mid-east with heavy editing). So go and watch it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
For Twihards Only..spoilers,"If you are not a Twihard or adore the books you probably will not get it. The movie is exactly what the fans wanted and the screenplay is true to the book. Bill Condon did a fabulous job. Only negative, music for the first 30 minutes is a bit cheesy-but does represent the romance. The make up was much better this movie but it was hard to watch Bella so skinny. Loved the movie, best yet. The acting has improved with each film. There were very difficult scenes to adapt but Melissa Rosenberg did it wonderfully. Even fans of the book miss a couple of details. Who actually changes Bella? Hint, its not Edward. The scene where Jacob imprints was done with such sincerity and sensitivity that it fit. The birth scene was difficult to see but the scene where Edward watches Bella get in to the bathtub was more difficult for me to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful Breaking Dawn,"This is a superbly well written movie! I totally loved it!! Well worth the money!! It was a beautiful, touching, amazing, and loving movie. The actors were great and aced the characters! I really got into the movie and genuinely enjoyed and loved it. I felt the feelings of the characters. This is the best romantic saga I have ever seen. Very loving,interesting, captivating, and emotional amazing movie! Ten stars hands down! I will recommend this movie to my friends! I can't wait to see Breaking Dawn again. A very refreshing movie, just like the rest of the Saga. The actors have great careers ahead of them. Stephanie is a beautiful writer, who wrote a great, beautiful, unique, and romantic book. I am a huge fan of hers. I am proud to leave a great review, because it is very much deserved!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bloody Good,"I personally think this was a major step up from the other movies, It was beautifully done. If you're looking for something ""better"" well then I'm sorry but that's impossible. This movie was Gross, Romantic, Action packed,funny, etc.I missed the cast, I missed getting excited about Twilight and this just brought every emotion back. This was very impressive. The characters all matured, it was very convincing and frankly Twilight was never meant to be a normal vampire film, its different. Its risky, I'm glad Steph decided on Vampire/demon kids, ""sparkling"" vamps because its unique not dumb. Maybe people nowadays still aren't into change.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best movie yet,"I am a Huge twilight fan i have read all the books and have seen all the movies. I think that this last one is by Far the Best movie. This movie did an excellent job on making you feel/understand how much Edward and Bella are in love. When you read the books that is one thing that you completely understand. This movie finally gets the point across. i think the honey moon was great...great love scenes. The special effects with Bella being sick. they did an excellent job. I have already gone to the movie twice. and i am going to see it again tonight. I love twilight. and these people are saying ""it took too long"" and ""it shows Bella and Edward kissing too much"" well than don't go see it. that is what the books are about so there for that is what the movie is about. if you love the books you will love the movie. i could have sat there longer. i think they should remake all the other ones like this one. i cant wait to own this one. i am not sure why the reviews are so bad. i just hope they don't let this effect the next movie. i hope they make it just like this one. i am happy sitting there for 3 hours for the movie. Love it...see it see it again.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A lovely visualisation of the book.,"Breaking Dawn is my favorite of the four books. This is a good film of the book, delightfully capturing the essence of the first half with little detour from the source. I was pleased enough to see it in two consecutive sessions today. There's a generous sprinkling of humor amid the drama and the story sprinted to make the two hours seems very short. I could have happily sat longer for a more detailed exploration of the characters and their relationships, especially amongst the wolves. I can't imagine what people will experience without knowing the saga fairly well beforehand. I've read some negative reviews and find it amusing that anyone not caring for the previous films would see this... more fool them. My thanks to the cast and crew for bringing the book to life on the screen. I wish part 2 wasn't so far away.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
my opinion on Part 1,"While I agree with some people's opinions that this movie was by far the best in the series; I don't agree that there is no reason to see the Part 2 of this last book. If you have read the books, you will understand the reason for the second part. If you read the books you should also know that the second part has more excitement than the first. I don't know that I would watch Part 1 again because the movie cut a lot out of the movie that was in the book, particularly scenes and information with the Quileute Wolves. Part 1 did have some touching scenes but some scenes were poorly executed; again this deals with the Wolves. The voice over sounded like cartoon voices. I think it would have been better if they would have used the actors' real voices instead of altering them.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not the disappointment I was expecting...,"After seeing the previous movies and reading some reviews from here, I braced myself for experiencing another boring, cheesy and over the top romantic flop but was gladly disappointed. It was of course still a romantic movie whose strongest and main message is one of selfless love and sacrifice, but having read the books I knew what to expect and I was fine with that. What I am not fine with, is the fact that some people, can tolerate a romantic novel but seem hell-bent on stepping all over a romantic movie. It's very simple to me; you know what you like, go watch that. This isn't a movie for everyone, but those who appreciate it's message, will surely enjoy it and find fewer faults in it.I enjoyed this one better than all the previous ones; it went smoother, it didn't bore me more than it I could take and even the actors seemed to have taken a few acting classes since the last one. I almost believed K. Stewart as Bella this time around. Well, almost; I still think she was a poor choice of casting along with Taylor Lautner. I especially enjoyed the fact that the soundtrack from the first movie made a comeback in this one. I liked the original music.I'm more excited to be looking forward to seeing the finale after watching this one now; I know there's more to enjoy as this story comes to an end.A 9/10 from me just to wind up some people:-)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twilight Breaking Dawn,"Having never read any of the Twilight books and having only seen the last three films because I was encouraged to do so, I have to admit that this is one of the better films of the year.Having seen the earlier Twilight films before this one I believe that Kristen Stewart for one, has come along greatly as an actress and was able to adapt very well to the character of Bella. She is able to demonstrate the upset, worry, emotional struggle and silent strength of the character very well, and I believed this made her a more believable character than ever before.Furthermore, Taylor Launtner seems to have come on leaps and bounds (no pun intended) in terms of getting the aggressive and yet caring Jacob out, without becoming too much of an eye candy. Further to this, Robert Pattinson, who I felt was a little tame in Eclipse especially, seemed to really change and improve, much like Stewart, and prove that there is a greater interest for the cinematic audience within his character. He proved that Edward does not simply jump from tree to tree and shout at people, but that he has a deeper side to him built upon his emotions for Bella.The story itself has greatly improved as well. Whilst the last films seemed to be all about who Bella should love and the ongoing frustration/emotional misunderstanding between Jacob and Edward, the latest instalment in the Twilight Saga has a far great plot within it, based upon the changes and fears of going from human to vampire, the unity of more than one 'unhuman' species and the difference that life brings as one grows greater with their knowledge.If we look past the common accusation that this is just another teen flick, or one 'for the girls' then we see that this is a film that has a strong story line, far more grown up and developed characters, and a 'part one' that manages to leave us wanting to see part two immediately, as opposed to other fictional series (Harry Potter). Breaking Dawn Part 1 was a very enjoyable film for myself, and it does not bother me that I was one of the only men in the cinema watching it, because it holds a story that reflects issue of real life, intertwined with that of the fantasy realm, and because of this, and the character development, I am eagerly anticipating Part two in the cinema, and I have, since watching the film, read the majority of the last book.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unfolding story of learning about our place in the world,"For many movies we see a lot of negative/positive comments, and that is to be expected in life, where few are the same, and uniqueness is rampant. When the plot involves love, something private for most of us , then it shouldn't be surprising to see often negative comments, about a otherwise wonderfully crafted movie both in terms of writing and acting , and everything in between.I fell in love with the entire series from the beginning, not because its sappy teen love or contains amazing special effects/makeup art, but because of the story it conveys to the reader/movie goer. It's not a story about superficial love and having sex, its about the journey of getting somewhere fulfilling and non superficial; of self discovery In this fast paced world, sometimes we forget there is more to love than just the act itself, that it embraces the better part of ourselves, that has no relation to hot lights & pornography , that instead its a story unfolding of interpersonal relationships and the growing as human beings in the process.I suspect like you, we am drawn to the charisma, the hope and the expectation that its going to have the proverbial 'happy ending'. Isn't that what most of us watch movies for honestly, to see some variation on that theme, and if we don't acquire it, hope that the movie contains some message about why ; because after all the happy ending isn't set in stone, and at least discovery, not always from ourselves can be a blessing in disguise as we all set out to discover who we are, and where we fit in in this sometimes fragile existence we call life.That's in part what entertainment is all about, and this latest offering in the series, does not let down.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twilighter at heart but disappointed,"The only reason why I gave this movie a 8 is because Im a Twilight fan.I've seen all the previous movies from the series and nothing compares to the first film hands down; it was haunting, it lured you in, the music was spot on. Breaking Dawn was a disappointment cause I was expecting more even though it stayed true to the book.Pros: Follows the book almost perfectly, its all about Bella and Edward,lots of romance,The fabulous house and location in the first bit OMG unbelievable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Cons: The score(music) was mediocre compares to the last 3. They have to stop putting so much white makeup on Edward!Bill Codon is satisfactory but what they should have done was bring back the director from the first film Catherine Hardwicke... her vision was way coolerAll in all I would recommend this movie if you are Twilight fan or a sucker for romance and adventure :)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Exiting,thrilling,edge of your seat,movie of the year. Loved it!","I am anything but a fan of the chick-flick,but I have been seduced by the entire twilight series. More questions than answers have been created by part 1. I believe that was the intention of the writers/directors. It left me wanting the answers and I suspect part two will break the all time top 5 movie opening night sales. Great movie I say spend the money for the big screen effect you will not be disappointed. Can't wait for the follow up.I was floored by the extremely low rating but am sure it will come up dramatically as the number of reviews increases. I believe that most of the ratings reflect the feeling of being left in the dark about so many questions in the plot however the release of part two will unveil part one as a true classic in my opinion.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Breaking Dawn - Grows up,"This was a film for fans of the series. If you are a fan, you will LOVE this film. The cinematography is without equal. Just watching the film will make you ""ooh and aah"" even if you are not crazy about the story.You can understand and appreciate the actions of the characters and their motivations for those actions. It is a film with true feeling as anyone who has ever been in love will tell you.I really enjoyed this movie and was quite pleasantly surprised by it. I especially loved the end scene. The wedding scene was also quite spectacular. In this writer's opinion, it is a movie not to be missed by fans of Twilight!Well done, Bill Condon!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Chix Chat on Film review: The honeymoon is over.,"I was immediately impressed by the look of this film, all the location shots were simply beautiful to behold from the wedding to the aerial view of Rio de Janeiro to Isle Esme. The special effects were so believable that I shuddered at the ferocity of the wolves and the rapidly diminishing health of Bella (Kristen Stewart), she really looked a hot mess. I had an expectation from the trailer that the film would be more action driven, but it was primarily a love story at least until the honeymoon was over with a wedding night pregnancy. At that point of course everything was all about protecting Bella, oh wait that's been the constant theme in the entire series. I have really grown tired of Jacob (Taylor Lautner) pining away for her. Dude get over it, it's never gonna happen! I know the stories correlate very closely to the books so there's nothing he can do about it, but I'm just saying. Maybe someone should show him the end of New Moon when she tells him it's Edward (Robert Pattinson), it's always been Edward, it's always gonna be Edward. The whole story with Jacob standing up to the pack was worthwhile, it showed that being in love with Bella hasn't completely emasculated him, although he pretty much did that for her too. I'm tickled each time I watch these films that Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) typically has one word dialogue, and basically just maintains that odd look of despair. I still don't understand how Charlie (Billy Burke) could live in Forks all this time and not figure out that there are Vampires and Werewolves and Bella figured it out within months of moving there. I actually did like this film, but I don't feel as if I would have missed very much had I just waited until Part Two when everything all comes together with the Volturi confrontation. I know from my family members who read all the books and are ultimately and completely infatuated with the stories that they left from seeing the movie satisfied. I left wanting more which I am sure was the whole point of breaking the final story into two parts. For anyone unfamiliar with the series and the books, this is not a must see film, because none of it would make sense if you just went to see a movie and checked this one out, but if you are familiar it was entertaining enough for me to give it an amber light.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Watch if you're a twilight fan,"I went to the premiere and I've read all of the books. First off, if you've hated the movies from the beginning then you're not going to like Breaking Dawn. I must admit, even if I am a fan of the books, I also disliked the first three movies. But this movie blew me away! The acting improved with Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson, and Taylor Lautner is exceptional. Bill Condon directed this perfectly, and took the series to the next level. And again, for all of the ""bad"" messages people take from this move, you have to read the books! All the stuff that happens in Breaking Dawn makes a lot more sense, and you won't think you wasted two hours. So basically, Breaking Dawn is a dream come true for Twilight fans and it won't disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie!,"I don't think that I saw the same movie that a lot of these other fans saw. I am an admitted Twihard, who has enjoyed all the films . I rank Breaking Dawn right up there with Twilight as far as being a satisfying film. I know that I'm not alone, because I sat in a theater for the midnight show in November 18th full of people who also loved it, in fact, gave it a standing O. I agree that if you're not into the series, you won't get much out of it, but for those of us who are, it covered all the bases. The way that it's raking in money worldwide, we're not alone, so chill out, if you hate it that much why did you bother and see it? I just thought that I'd put a positive review among all these negative ones.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Well, I maybe a bit biased because I'm just a girl who in love with Edward Cullen, please forgive me. / / And I just can't wait for the sequence. Hopefullly it will gives me impact just like the Part 1 did or even more.And anyway,Taylor Lautner is not that handsome, I wonder why friends are crazy over him.

An even better love story than Twilight.,"I feel slightly foolish reviewing this since I sort of figure that if you sat through the first three movies then you're going to check this out sooner or later and if you haven't seen them, well ... ""saga"" is right there in the title.But I was pleasantly surprised by this. I'm not a twi-hard but I think it's fair to say a lot of the more vocal hate hurled against this movie has an ulterior motive.Throughout the series, there has always been that biblical undertone; that question of whether it's better to pursue transhuman power or maintain our humanity and it all finally comes to the boil in a pretty intense narrative of tribal conflict, belonging and challenging predicaments.For the first time I think I can really feel what the fans feel about this story. The Saga can be a bit alienating to people who don't fetishize the central romance but with the groundwork thoroughly applied, Meyer's hard work pays off at least on screen. For me, the aesthetic value of a romance is limited by the development of the participants and as much as I like Bella Swan (I'd date her before Hermione, *shrug*) she and her Beau (see what I did there?!) have never really struck me as having much definition as characters except in terms of their relationship with each other (which was always a bit insta-lovey). But here the substance of the story shines through and it truly feels the part of that series you always wished you could have read as a kid.The nuances of this ""miracle"" child, the character that always calls it a ""fetus"" in contrast to the one that insists it's a ""baby"" should be apparent to everyone. It leads us to an edgy situation of the conflict of supporting your loved one and avoiding the actions that may take them away from you. I was compelled.Meanwhile, simmering tensions between bestiality and necrophilia, uh I mean...the werewolves and the vampires are pretty epic. In addition to a poignant rendition of someone's familial loyalty tested by doing what one feels is right we get to see that Jacob is way more than eye candy.I think it reflects positively on the series that we open with a wedding on what is to all practical purposes the ""Final Chapter"". Harry Potter also did this curiously albeit to fairly peripheral characters. Popular culture has trained me to see a wedding of this kind as the natural conclusion to any epic series but here, the real challenges (as they often do in real life) begin after the vows have been exchanged.So much of the first act is the marriage and honeymoon. It's strange how sitcomy the whole thing feels at times (or maybe whatever Hollyoaks is would be a better analogy), seriously, the ""let's do anything but bang"" montage was something I was totally not prepared for, complete with the chess-board of platonicalness.But my girl Kristen looks fabuloso. She is radiant when she needs to be and vulnerable when she needs to. If your memory of Stewart is the first movie, well she has honed her craft and she is pretty breathtaking in this. And girl gets LAID!!! Too bad the playa hating censors had to neuter this picture but the director really makes the best of it. Seriously, the trivia says it was her thrusting that the issue. Never say a girl doesn't commit...The rest is the eye popping blockbuster you'd expect. The production design, the convincing giant wolves, the stunning fights, all wrapped together in the Pacific Northwest Gothic aesthetic that Twilight has really made its own. The use of color and setting is actually quite majestic. The music is always on point, Carter Burtwell's Orestral (Danny who?) as well as the popular songs applied make every moment count, not just the wedding.If there's one negative thing that remains in the mind, it's the CGI infant. But it's not as bad as everyone says it is.People think of this series as trite young adult fiction because that's pretty much what it is. But that's not a bad thing, and this entry to the series really shows a saga that began as chocolate box romance blossom into something that's actually pretty impressive. The series has grown-up with its fan-base (well the movies have, I've only read the first one and its gender-flip) and managed that for more effectively than I felt Harry Potter did (no offense intended to the Potter heads reading, I can admit that I'm a low-key fan myself of specific parts). Cards on the table: I can barely remember what the third movie was even about. Is it about anything? There's a love triangle and the vampire council is mad at them for some reason and there's Dakota Fanning well past her prime..., really I DID see it...But if for whatever reason you have not seen the other sequels and are reading reviews of this movie (we would get along), then I am inclined to say that you could do a lot worse than this. I never felt bored for a second of its 2 hour run time.My Fascination with this series not withstanding, I am Tempted to say that you shouldn't Hesitate to enjoy the Revelations of this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Well-Done Movie,"Breaking Dawn Part 1 is an enjoyable adaptation of the first part of the book. Screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg did a good job overall.The photography and CGI were excellent, and they were better than the previous Twilight movies. There are a lot of beautiful pictures, and the wolves are more realistic than ever.The performances were better than ever. Kristen Stewart was wonderful. Taylor Lautner and the others were also very good.The weakest part of the movie was the struggle within the wolf pack.

"An overload of swoony, cheesy romance, but that doesn't make it not good.","The twilight films are always going to be the easiest film franchise for people to make fun of, but honestly I don't think they are that bad, well New Moon was pretty bad, But Twilight, Eclipse and this are all rather good. People have complained that the story is split in to two parts but I think for a book as long as Breaking Dawn there's no other way it could be done.Being split in two parts allows the first film to concentrate on the very melodramatic but still nice romance between Bella and Edward, the wedding and honeymoon scenes are quite lovely to watch. I'm guessing that all the action is being saved for Part 2, which is wise I think, putting it in this film would have been too much I think.This is easily the darkest and most adult of the franchise, it has some truly awesome scenes, in particular the dream sequence at the beginning and the birthing scene, they are both pretty messed up. The only thing I can say is bad is the acting by most of the cast, Kristen Stewart is the only one with any type of acting ability,this may sound silly but I think if this weren't a twilight film people would be wowed by her performance, she's exceptional and the heart and soul of the film. The same can't be said about Ashley Greene though, she is a terrible actress *ahem Summers Moon ahem*, she's kinda laughable as with the rest of them.The sex scene is a bit of a cop out, but we can always hope and pray for a directors cut DVD.

Amazing,"This was the first Twilight movie that I actually saw in the theater. I was blown away. I was very skeptical about watching the first Twilight. It took me a year or more after it came out to decide to give it a shot. So many people were telling me how it was a ""teen"" type film. Wow! They were wrong. I was hooked the minute I watched them. They got better and better and better. I can not wait until breaking Dawn 2 comes out 11-16-2012. Yes, I am following it that much. I was in such anticipation for the wedding that I almost could not contain myself. It was amazing how they made it work, it was all very breath taking. I think that they made the sex scene very tasteful and what it should be between two people that have waited. Then, when it came to Bella being pregnant and looking the way that she did, they did an amazing job at making her like like pure heck! When Jacob imprinted on Rennesme I cried so much. The only thing i think I was most mad about was the ending, but then again, they do have to make you want to see the second one. Come on November I am waiting!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quite awful,"I am not familiar with the back story or this saga. I saw this film as when I turned up at the cinema, the screen for the film that I wanted to see was full, so I saw this as we had nothing better to do. Or so I thought! Frankly, with hindsight, I think I would have rather walked the streets. This film really is awful. It's boring, tedious, corny, over-long and so slow that at one point I thought it was going backwards. With wooden acting, disgraceful screenplay and without even decent CGI to add a bit of entertainment, I cannot really mention anything to redeem it. The cinema was full of screaming, giggling girls, so maybe that sums it up......",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Forever is only the beginning..ain't that the truth?,"Roger Ebert, one of the most widely beloved film critics once had a quote about the infamous Larry Bishop gangster spoof Mad Dog Time. That quote went ""''Mad Dog Time'' is the first movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time."" That's how I ultimately feel about The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1. It is a terrible film that, despite its best efforts, turns into a big pile of nothingness. What did the filmmakers want to accomplish here? Well, there are a couple thing such as money, cabbage, and oh yeah, dough. This film was made on the assumption that millions of teenage girls are going to throw down their allowance to go see it. As I went to a public theater to see this and not an advanced screening, their assumptions was right. I was the only male in the theater. No boyfriends, husbands, males by themselves, ETC. May I also mention that there was a very limited range of females under 16 in the theater. Seriously, who thinks of this crap? This film can be summed up in a simple, short explanation-it's a soap opera made for young women instead of middle aged women. I'm not trying to sound sexist or derogatory but this is the way the world works..movies are made specifically for teenage girls to throw their allowance down. Unfortunately, this one, like most of them is petrifying to watch.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I loved it, give me a break the rest of you naysayers","The rating of 4.9. is ridiculously low and most definitely unfounded. Give me a break people! (yes I was born in the 70's). I LOVED the music, I LOVED the emotion, I LOVED the nostalgia. I was very much affected by this movie. I think it was very well done, from a regular person's point of view (who else really counts as far as the box office is concerned). The wedding made me cry (because of the music), the honeymoon locale and ambiance was unforgettable (I would do anything for a moonlit night on an exotic beach with the man of my dreams), the rest of the story and particularity the music was moving and I felt, well acted and convincing. The low IMDb ratings for the Twilight movies, despite the exorbitant profits is a little annoying. I LOVE watching them as do obviously a gazillion other people! Be sure to view this with the lights low, a glass of wine (if you are of age) and an open heart and you will be transported into the feelings of love and life and the emotion of it will be an absolutely unforgettable experience.

How come any one like this movie,"Well, I don't want to sound rude or offensive. Also I don't come out and write reviews about every movie release every Friday. But as I was expected after watching this low standard, crappy quality, soft porn in the name of movie making, I was expecting all the negative comments and not at all expecting any positive reviews from even the die hard fans of Twilight. But by looking at only 1 positive comment and rating out of 55 negative comment made me think, what happen to the new generation, but I don't blame them, they are all kids of 15-24 years and haven't seen or know what movie making or what is Hollywood stands for. If these kids really wants to watch the so called Vampire and Werewolf movies and some quality into fiction. Go watch Interview with Vampire, Dracula and few others. But this is total insane, in fact this series totally kill the future of vampire and werewolf movies, I really like this genre and been watching these movies since I was kid, but the quality and drama and crappy acting of the entire cast, on the top of that the crappy direction which is so low in standard that they kill the prospect of future movies on this genre, people would start thinking and comparing any future good or bad movie with these movies and certainly those movie will get killed before even given a fare chance. I strongly recommend that the censor not only look for offensive scene and language but they should look for quality of movie making and ban these kind of low standard movies and director altogether. At least there is some chance of Hollywood to regain its past glory. Now a days Japaneses, Korean, Spanish and Mexican movies are far better and superior in quality.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Twilight: Breaking Dawn part 1 - Should Your Teen See It?,"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1, reviewed by our 13-year-old critic, Daniel Menegaz is the first half of the final installment of the Twilight saga movies based on the novel by Stephanie Meyer that has gripped the nation since Twilight first came out on print. Here are Daniel's comments: It is about the tortured love story between Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart) and Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson) the vampire. In this first part, Bella gets married, and then gets pregnant on her honeymoon. Having read Breaking Dawn, I thought it was fairly accurate to the story. Although, the book doesn't have quite enough information to stretch into two movies, I found the movie a little boring. The movie has some heavy drama; in fact, that is something I didn't like. All the characters seemed to be depressed at what should have been a happy moment. Other than that, the movie was fairly good. I really enjoyed the soundtrack and particularly the scenes. The movie has some very stunning nature shots. I think this movie is for ages 13 and up because of very inappropriate subject matter regarding the sex and Bella's pregnancy. Overall, I would give this movie 3.5 out of 5 stars. If you are looking for a movie filled with drama, vampires, and werewolves, this is your movie.

great  movie,"this was a wonderful movie, for us who are twilight fans, we waited for breaking dawn part 1, and wow it was worth the wait. we are looking forward to breaking dawn part 2. so let us twilight/hard fans enjoy,keep your negative opinions to yourself. the movie was very watchable, and i would watch it again as a lot others have. if there's a six film production, (hoping with the same cast and crew), we will wait for it also- hope it would be about (leah) she needs to be happy, either way, we are sure whatever they decide to do in the future the story lines only would be better and better. as long as our happy Cullen family couples remains together, love the closeness of the that family. whatever they decide to do we are sure it will be excellent to us twilight fans. so Stephanie Meyers please keep up the good explosive work-thanks for the cast and crew, they are the best combination. i have purchased all the books, movies, and soundtracks all outstanding. waiting patiently for more. Edward and Bella with baby and so much love between them and the entire family, just breathtaking. thanks",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Part I,"I found several scenes worthwhile after all. The problem with TWILIGHT is the basic premise: Girl is torn between a vampire and a werewolf. Filmmakers have trod this familiar path before, most popularly with the Kate Beckinsale-starred, UNDERWORLD, as well as on cable TV's THE VAMPIRE DIARIES. And a cornucopia of wannabe authors have cropped up after Stephenie Meyer's meteoric rise and TWILIGHT's phenomenal success. In the hands of Catherine Hardwicke, the first two films delved deep into Bella Swann's musings and quandaries, while bombarding us with innumerable scenes straight out of a Vogue pictorial with beauteous vampires dressed to the nines and pouting angstily. This third film (broken into two parts, bringing in more dollars for the people involved) is handily directed by Bill Condon, who gave us the wonderfully crafted GODS AND MONSTERS.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Light the candles!!!!!!!!!! Time to make love !!!!!!!,"Synopsis; Wedding stuff, baby stuff. Jake get's mad. Basic love tri.The Good; Great movie length. Fresh soundtrack. Teaches morals.Neutral; The acting is neither bad nor good.The Bad; No Volturi. Horrible CGI scene. One scene skips over some important info, and was rusdhed(left me confused).Opinion; 100% made for females. Wedding, Baby, Love Triangle = Perfect Formula. The action scenes, and moral reasoning for fights are left out here. Like a Lifetime Channel movie, despite one or two really great scenes. A really watered down Darren Alonofsky film. A Mormon undertone disturbed me on a religious level and on a basic level. Not sure if it was intentional or not.Funny; The dialog really bothered me because Jacobs tribe uses a word ""imprint"" which makes me think of having sex or peeing on a tree every time it's used.Expectations; For the 3rd installment of a huge franchise I thought this would be a little bit more epic, but I can see why they split it in to two parts. They kind of made a cool little story out of this one, but not epic at all. Overall this was a decent film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"First half slow, second half redeeming","This is actually my least favorite movie out of the twilight films, and I love these books and films. I'm really sad and disappointed. They split the final book into two movies so they had more time to develop the storyline¬Öat least that's what I thought (aside from making more money), and this is what they end up with? This movie rubbed me the wrong way from the first few minutes with the dream sequence. The true dream was about immortal children. It's the whole foundation of the entire book and to change it to newborn fears was wrong. The wedding was drawn out too long, I was actually bored¬Öand those stupid toast just added insult to injury. Then the honeymoon¬ÖKristen's acting was completely one dimensional, it was like trying to watch some who's overly Botox friendly make a facial expression. She's great w/pain and stress, but we already knew that from her diabetic scene in Panic Room. They excluded one of the best dichotomies, which is the combative relationship between Rosalie and Jacob; it's great and funny. They underdeveloped Seth's (and Leah's) presences, Edwards agony, and the draw between Jacob and Reneesme in the womb. The director took too many liberties with creative interpretation. The only saving grace is the amazing special effects with Bella's pregnancy, the birth, and the transformation!!!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The movie is good, but is just that !","When you see a movie, you wait for this, I waited for one and a half year for this movie, I waited to see the Bill Condon direction... But don't it's different of the other movies of the saga. The story evolves SO MUCH, and Melissa did a great job with Stephenie but Bill don't was able enough to transfer this. Love, Love, Drama, Love, Action, Love. This is the movie... I have to say that the makeup it's PERFECT ! But the visual effects are ridiculous... Kristen Stewart did a GREAT job ! But Robert don't...

Now this is what they call the beginning of the end,"Okay. This fourth movie of the Twilight Saga has totally been underrated. The movie will exceed most, if not all, people's expectation. It exceeded mine and I'm not at all a fan of this movie series. I watched it because it's my job to watch movies. The first three series are not that bad but they are all as frustrating as the other and one thing's for sure about that, it's because of the power the movie holds - romance, thrill, pain, the impossibles - everything about it makes you want to watch it more during the actual showing.

"So many bad reviews, good thing I didn't listen to them, you shouldn't either!","I normally don't care for Twilight, but since I've been watching them all since they came out, I HAD to watch this one as well. I can say that this movie is almost flawless. This was by far not only my favorite Twilight film, but I can honestly say this is on my Top 10 already. From the beginning the flawless love and the wedding and the beauty in it all. It was SO believable, the acting, the visually stunning. I am very impressed. It had my heart and gut wrenching all the way until the end credits. The music was perfect with this film too.

Haters gonna hate,"Now now. Before you assume the position to actually be for or against, I'm just going to humbly share what began with thinking of the twilight saga something for retarded teenagers, induced by hormonal spiking before a regression of awkwardness would subside by age and matured tastes would flourish. But soon I found myself watching, which by many critics hating as the worst one, as the most intriguing one . After all. It is what I sincerely felt was a really good movie! Something which I hadn't had the fortune to have seen for a while. For some reason many are hellbent on hating this movie for reasons that are either beyond my ability to register, and despite that I am regarded as a bright individual. The acting, even how critical I could muster myself to be, moves forward without any reflections due to annoyances, expect for the scene where the wolfs voices felt embarrassing.Im disappointed that IMDb has shown to be prone to people who intellectualize their inability to asses emotional depth. Some critic amused me with calling this a misogynistic movie, for an example. How in hell could anyon think of Bellas relationship with Edward and Jacob in any way sexist ? That is just quasi-intellectually absurd.I was led to think of the twilight series as nothing else than a waste of my time, before I even had seen it. Breaking dawn a couple of months away from premier, I was encouraged to see the previous movies, and I have to say that the series dwells in more realistic action of the everyday life and the assertiveness that conflicts would arise, is in breaking dawn much more down to earth than in the previous movies.What Meyers has done with the twilight saga, has led me to think that she certainly had had to come up with the story with a psychological mindset that ensued the development of her fictional characters, which deal with the uncertainties and fears of love and nature. I at least find the thought of grim death no way near as terrifying as the thought that I myself could be responsible for, as well the worries that arise from what can happen due to the love between couples turns more complicated when the love between to people prematurely in mind and spirit goes from simpe to complicated. For no mere thought of optimism, can be overshadowed by the realistic thinking of the prelude of love can onset a myriad of troubles that can't be undone, is very responsible and one of lives hardest facts to be deat with. There are very mature thoughts embedded in the story that grasp the neurotic fears of inexperience and uncertainty that I can relate to.The acting is good because there are no exaggerated feelings that are tried to be conveyed by facial expressions, tone, tempo, gestures or mannerism that could arouse any awareness if you are not nitpicking. Than you would find faults in your own doctrine of narrowness. Being any more of an actor in this movie, I think had led it to have felt overly reactive and made the characters embarrassing . Its just there to the degree that the viewer has to actually put themselves in the characters position. There is no need for more, but saying that was its intent, is going to far. It works and its power lies far from being impotent. Its the viewer who has to put themselves in their position. So there is no reason, as far as I personally can tell, to argue that the acting is unsatisfactory. If it had been, the shared experience had to have been much more consistently plaque-ing the viewer. It just doesn't to appeal to some intellectually satisfactory. Which there is little grounds for. I enjoyed it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The BEST so far in the Twilight Movie Series!,"Yes! 10 out 10 because I SO love everything about this movie. I'm not sure why the overall rating here in IMDb is so low but for all Twilight fanatics like me, this is so far the best flick in the Twilight Movie Series.All the ignorant critics can say what ever crap they want to throw, but they can't take away how Twilight has been absorbed and has been interpreted by its millions of fans worldwide.This is not just about a teenager wanting to marry the guy she wants but this is all about the colliding of two different worlds - that of a HUMAN and that of a VAMPIRE (plus there's a werewolf too).Twilight is a very entertaining story that doesn't only appeal to teenagers but to middle-aged people as well. Twilight is like a porn, an obsession, a fantasy that is overwhelming - the very reason why there are a lots of people who go GAGA over it.Breaking Dawn is the last book of the Twilight Series and it sure has all the elements that make all the characters more lovable - so adorable.For all Twilight fans out there who haven't watched Breaking Dawn Part 1 yet, then you SHOULD watch it.Can't wait for part 2.

Best Twilight Yet,"For someone who has read the books, I am more critical than most people and I believe it was the best one yet. The Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn Part 1 is almost completely based off the book. I loved it. The actors have really advanced in their acting since the very first one and a lot since the previous one, The Twilight Saga Eclipse. Especially, Kristin Stewart. She has had a lot of trouble showing emotions in the other movies, but in Breaking Dawn Part 1 she has really expanded her talents and made Bella a very round character. I couldn't have been more pleased with the movie. Only one cuss word and no nudity, but there is definitely innuendo.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"If You Don't Like Twilight, Don't Go","The Twilight Saga film adaptations have all previously left something to be desired and it was for this reason that I initially didn't want to go and be disappointed with Breaking Dawn. However, after going and seeing it, I was thoroughly surprised by the movie.Let me first say that while I am a fan of the Twilight Saga books I have, up until now, not been a very large fan of the movies. Breaking Dawn Part 1 has served to alter this slightly.Of the two hours that I sat in the cinema, I was only annoyed three times by deviations from the book. I won't list these (they'd spoil things), but as far as book-to-film adaptations go, making only three proper ‚Äì but not unnecessary ‚Äì changes is quite a feat.The splitting of the book into two films was, in my opinion, an excellent idea. It made it possible to have all of the details in the movie, all of the plot points and little nuances that help to fully develop a story. The movie could have been shortened though, as it began to drag a little bit in places.As far as the acting went, I was also pleasantly surprised. Kristen Stewart is not known for her large range of emotions, but I was glad to see a few smiles, laughter, fear, surprise, anger and even adoration. Her acting has stepped up a notch (perhaps not a very big one though) and the rest of the cast were just as commendable, if not more so.The cinematography was good; there were some beautiful island scenes, a sun over the mountains, a beautiful wedding scene ‚Äì in fact, there was only one instance when the camera work annoyed me, when it constantly shifted between two faces during a conversation, quickly becoming repetitive and a little dizzying.The music was well chosen too, and I particularly liked the use of Bella's Lullaby by Carter Burwell in one of the final scenes of the movie. I never felt like the music was taking anything away from the scene, or that it was overdone.Overall, I give the movie an 8 out of 10 because as far as Young Adult book adaptations go, this one was the best I've seen so far; the acting was better than I expected it to be, the ending was perfect, the camera work was well-done, the music was endearing and I left the cinema wishing that I could turn right around and watch it again. However, it could have been shorter or faster-paced, and looking neutrally, certain scenes were slightly awkward, long-winded or unnecessary.As a semi-Twilight fan I liked the movie, but I have to add that unless you go into the cinema looking for the good, you won't find anything to like about Breaking Dawn Part 1.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Low Ratings?,"I don't necessarily understand why this movie is getting such low reviews. I'm a big fan of the Twilight movies, and I believe this one to be the best yet. It does not deserve the 4.8 that it's getting on IMDb. I guess it's just the ""cool"" thing to hate on Twilight, huh? People need to grow up. If you honestly saw it, and believe that it deserves a 1 or 2, please, feel free to rate it as that, but if you're a hater, and you're coming on here to rate it low just because you can, get yourself together and get a life. ---------------------------------------------- < I put those dashes because I had to have at least 10 lines in this review.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pleasantly Surprised,"I really liked this movie. Which shouldn't be taken lightly because after seeing the first movie, I almost set fire to the movie theater!! I was SO disappointed with the first movie, and found myself having to justify my feelings for the books over and over, while simultaneously trying to explain the real story to my friends and family who had never had the pleasure of reading the books. I do think though, since changing directors, that the movies have only improved.While it can definitely be said that Stephanie Meyers isn't the best writer as far as grammar goes, and even her with her wording, she is a good story teller. So, to me, having the books made into movies is ideal. And since the stories are being told without her well-intended, but redundant and flawed writing getting in the way, they have the opportunity to be a true representation.The fourth book was my favorite one and so I was very nervous and ready to be let down by this movie, but to my very pleasant surprise, I was quite impressed at how good it was! My biggest fear was that they would deviate from the story line, which they did do but not to the point where it ruined it. I do think that the movie could have been more subtle with the sex scenes, since the book had been quite graceful about them, and since their is a younger audience to be aware of. Other than that though, I was pleasantly surprised with Kristen's decision to express her emotions in such a strong way. In some parts of the movie, I genuinely felt and believed she was Bella. It's sad that it has taken her four movies to decide to be incredible, but better late than never I suppose.And that's my review! Thanks for reading and God bless! ~Ashley",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (A)----------------Rating: 4/5,"The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (A)----------------Rating: 4/5An action romantic adventure flick.... very beautifully filmed this is an vampire movie.....The Quileutes close in on expecting parents Edward and Bella, whose unborn child poses a threat to the Wolf Pack and the towns people of Forks.There is a melodramatic tone throughout, amplified by the music, whether it was the piano-heavy soft moments, the epic score (often played over non-epic moments), or the emo rock songs. A little melodrama is fine, but it goes on for most of the movie, and when there is little hook of a story, it just becomes a drag. Even people who are fans to the series will admit that dialogue has never been its strong suit. Bill Condon attempts to make the sex scene and honeymoon to be tender, but it came off more sappy and overbearing.""Part 1's"" strength is that it is the best-acted of the series. Stewart certainly gives it a good go and Lautner gives what is a half-way decent performance. Pattinson was slumming it, but with some of the cheesy dialogue he has to say, even someone like Laurence Olivier would have struggled.Condon does have a few moments of visual darkness, including the dream sequence in the beginning with its juxtaposition of bright white clothing and blood and Bella and Edward standing on top of a load of corpses. The birth scene was actually intense and gory. But these are counter-balanced with goofy moments, one of the most infamous being a psychic werewolf argument.The whole wedding sequence and honeymoon plays like a young girl's fantasy, sort of idealistic. This is fine, but hardly dramatic and not likely to have wide appeal.Previous ""Twilight"" movies have had some interesting side issues that could and should have been explored. This is not the case with ""Part 1."" There are no issues of a man resisting his urges and dark side, a young teen forced into being a vampire, an army of powerful new vampires being formed and the idea of there being a vampire council. There is nothing like that. The few themes there are include a look into Edward's past, a brief debate about abortion and the idea of imprinting, which is basically brainwashing. A better idea could be looking at somebody forcing someone else to love them. That would be a dark story.""Breaking Dawn Part 1"" is the weakest movie in the series so far and I speak as someone who is neutral to the overall experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Trying to get as much money out of the final without enough in return,"I was surprised when I watched the first Twillight movie that I liked it. Vampire movies are not the kind of movies I normally like and all the hype around it wasn't attracting me either. But I surprisingly enjoyed the first movie. A day later I watched the second and third one. The second movie was a bit disappointing but the third one made up first it again and felt at the same level like the first.Yesterday I went to watch the first part of the fourth movie to spend some times with friends. Already not being really a fan of the movies but having enjoyed the first ones, this kind of movies must be pretty good for me to like them. I was okay with the beginning because it had potential, it changed fast in a let's put as much as possible into the movie but all fast and short just so that you know it happened and you've seen it. The hardest job after a movie has sequels which score well with the public is managing to make a good last movie I think. Unfortunately hey didn't manage for the Twillight saga.I am curious about how the second part will be but as the first part gave me a bit an uninterested feeling and the end kind of makes you already know how the second part might go, it won't be a movie I will be watching in the movie theatre.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The storyline was very well-written and well-explained, even though it was simple and easy to understand. The characters were exactly the same and they were still very interesting and well-developed. The casting choices were the same as before, but their performances were improved. I have to admit, it was a very intense movie and there were some shocking moments during the movie. The opening scene was predictable, but it was promising and enjoyable. In my opinion, the birth scene was probably the most intense, shocking and kinda scary part of the movie. Moreover, the ending scene was kinda predictable, but it was emotionally intense. By the way, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both very well done.

A Great Film,"Carries on from the previous films as Bella goes through an emotional journey. Recommended by the legal badge-12A. Most twilight fans will enjoy the exiting drama and suspense. Otherwise, the birth scene may be found disturbing for some. There is a lot of blood, so not recommended to those who are squeamish. According to reports the birthing scene in the movie has caused in-theatre seizures known as photosensitive epilepsy. It's believed that the bright flashing of red and black colours is causing the incidents. Personally, I enjoyed this film, due to intense plot and dramatic scenes.

Actually OK...,"After reading the reviews you would think that this was the worst movie ever produced... Quite frankly I rather liked it. I was a glued as to what would happen next. Yes this movie is what I would call a filler. Matrix 2 was a filler movie.A filler movie is a movie that is there to tie one story line to another story line. Otherwise what happens is that the next instalment has to spend about 30 minutes tying up loose ends.Oh wait what is that story line? Well if you had waited until the end, moved through the credits (while listening to the song) you would know what the new storyline is... I am not going to say it, but I am going to let all of those reviewers who hated the movie figure that out on their own. In this movie many stage pieces were set, which I thought about and thought was quite interesting.I am looking forward to the last part. Did it move slow in parts? Sure did, but so did Harry Potter, Lords of the Rings, and Matrix... To put things in context, an argument could be made that the fighting scenes in each of these movies just dragged on and on...

A fun film that's oodles better than the book,"As flawless as anything from Stephenie Meyer is going to get. The makeup and special effects- work in this film were absolutely stunning, and Bella's transformation into a weak, powerless shell carrying a child inside her was magnificent. Once again, Taylor Lautner shows off his acting chops (he even has an intense crying scene this time!). Shockingly, the haircuts and costumes were the best out of all the films in this movie. Jasper (Jackson Rathbone) who normally looks absolutely ridiculous, manages to actually have decent hair for once. There are a few things that seem just as dumb on screen as they did on the page (Jacob imprints on Renesmee? The name Renesmee?), but for the most part, screenwriter Melissa Rosenberg works with Stephenie to craft something much better than was actually in the book. The birthing scene alone has a lot of power to it. The cinematography was great and, as always, I totally loved the soundtrack (which was kind of a mix of indie and pop/rock). I honestly don't feel there's any proper way they can make Part 2 cinematically pleasing, because the last half of Meyer's novel was an absolute trainwreck. Here's hoping that it's even halfway as good as this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Brilliant!,"This film is fantastic, if you liked the other movies you'll love this! It's very cleverly done and leaves you wanting more at the end, stays very true to the book. I think any twilight fan would love this movie regardless of other reviews on here. It's a fantastic film and I will be buying the DVD when it's released. I will not give anything away, but if you have read the book, it is not as disturbing as you may expect during certain parts. However, it is a 12 for a reason and although my younger sister who is 9 watches the Harry potter saga where some are 12's, she will not be watching the twilight saga! It's the perfect length for a movie,not too long but long enough. It's definitely a good idea to split the final book into two films so you can achieve the write amount f detail. Overall, brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie,If you liked the book this film is great. Very good book to film conversion. Very good visually and enjoyed the performances from all Actors. Excellent direction and retains characterisation and atmosphere from books. Action was very good and Jacob is FINE :). The humour that runs through the books is brought out beautifully in this film especially regarding Bella's Dad. Bella's relationship with her Dad is also portrayed well. All the fantastical events are really brought to life. I think this film has been my favourite so far. It really brings out the action parts in the book especially the final scene. A perfect film for a Friday night in - recommend to all Twilight fans. I saw this on the big screen and have recently bought on Blu Ray. Can't wait for Part 2.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
