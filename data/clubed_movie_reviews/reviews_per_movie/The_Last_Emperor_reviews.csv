Impressive,"'The Last Emperor' tells the story of Pu Yi, as an adult played by John Lone, the last emperor of China. He was three years old when he first sat down on the Dragon Throne. He didn't know anything. The movie tells his story from that moment in flashbacks. We also get to see Pu Yi when the Chinese Communists have the power and he is imprisoned. Because people have taken care of him the rest of his life, from three years old to the moments inside the prison, it still feels he knows nothing.To tell you about the life of Pu Yi would be a mistake. You have to see this movie to learn more about it. The strange thing is that Pu Yi can not do and decide much for himself. He is a hero of a movie where he is controlled by rules and other people. That is one of the reasons not many real things happen. We see the emperor grow up, we see him take an empress and a concubine, and then he has to leave the Forbidden City because the enemy is at the gate.The impressive thing here are the locations and the costumes. Everything looks fabulous and it is not a surprise to find out that the movie was shot on location. With all the extras in those beautiful costumes there are a lot of very impressive scenes. May be the movie is a bit too long for some, it didn't really bother me. Director Bernardo Bertolucci has made a terrific movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An Oriental paradise that is wonderfully mastered to the screen.,"I guess I'm the only one who watched this from a worn out-of-print VHS copy. No matter what the quality, THE LAST EMPEROR is arguably among the best of the foreign pictures. The sights and sounds of The Forbidden City are sharp and beautifully screened right on with the provocative events that unfold the coming-of-age life of Pu Yi. It has plentiful moments including his romantic affairs with concubines and how he learns the way of the world as a child. His chronicle of a young emperor boy paints a colorful picture for the first half, only leading to more conflicting matters later, which is the most exciting part. Don't expect to see heads getting chopped off, like I thought would happen (unless you have the longer DVD version), but the intensity of the talk surrounding it sounds horrifying and true. Nevertheless, the dialogue is clearly mystical. Every minute is a feel-good breeze through crafty cinematic art, but it ends too fast, and the narration from Pu Yi in his prison term could use a lot more detailing. Maybe I'll stick around longer and wait to see the Director's Cut which has more. Definitely a winning treat not to be missed for foreign movie lovers and collectors of premium filmfare.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Beautiful Epic,"The Last Emperor is a truly larger than life film telling us about a life of a human, but not just any human, the Emperor himself. He's also not your normal emperor, he's the Last Emperor of China, his name is Pu Yi. He lives his life however he wants to and he sort has a larger than life persona. In just his late 20s, he stood at the throne ruling over one of the largest nations on Earth, with the most people on Earth. He controls and commands the lives of nearly Five-Hundred Million people. Throughout his abdication, his decline and dissolute lifestyle; his exploitation by the invading Japanese, and finally to his obscure existence as just another peasant worker in the People's Republic.While the film isn't perfect, it is certainly beautiful and a visual treat for anyone. Bernardo Bertolucci's cinematic biography of Emperor Pu Yi is an emotional, beautiful and astonishing film... And it's a massive production which won 9 Oscars, It deserved every single one of them. The film will always be remembered for its size and its beauty. This Asian Masterpiece tells us a story of not only an Emperor, but of a country, which was and still is the largest nation in the world. The Last Emperor is certainly one the Largest, most beautiful films ever created in Cinema.A Monumental Achievement. ~10/10~",10.0,Anonymous,History
An Example of Quantity and Quality Combining to Make an Unforgettable Film,"""The Last Emperor"" is a near perfect film.  It was nominated for nine Oscars in 1987 and it won nine (including the Best Picture Oscar).  The movie is about the life of Pu Yi (John Lone), China's last emperor.  In spite of becoming emperor at the age of three, Yi's reign was more of a burden than anything else.  Yi would ultimately end up living an unsavory life of imprisonment which is heartrending to the viewer.  ""The Last Emperor"" is visually stunning.  The minute details are amazing.  However, the story stands up high as well.  Historically accurate for the most part, ""The Last Emperor"" is easily one of the top 10 films of the 1980s and overall an exceptional achievement in every cinematic department known to man.  5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,History
A great artistic achievement,"Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor"" is a monumental, perfect film, and stands as one of the great artistic achievements in any artistic medium.Told in a complicated flashback/ flash-forward style, it's the story of Pu Yi (born 1906) who was the last absolute monarch of China. During his lifetime he falls from the Lord of Ten Thousand Years, the emperor/God of billions of Chinese, to an anonymous peasant worker in communist China.Pu Yi was the child emperor from 1908 until the Chinese revolution in 1911 when he had to abdicate. He was allowed to remain in the Forbidden City but was stripped of his power by the communists. He was expelled from the city in 1924 by a warlord. In 1932, Puyi was installed by the Japanese as the ruler of Manchukuo, a puppet state of Imperial Japan. At the end of World War II, Pu yi was captured by the Soviet Red Army and turned over to the Chinese communists. Considered a traitor, he spent ten years in a reeducation camp until he was declared reformed. He voiced his support for the Communists and worked at the Beijing Botanical Gardens.This film vividly portrays the change from the imperial and religious traditions of ancient China to the godless totalitarianism of modern communist China, so the film is, on one level, the story of China's revolutionary transition from imperialism to communism.Visually the film is stunning especially the scenes in the Forbidden City. It was the first film to receive permission to film in the Forbidden City.The film can be enjoyed on the first viewing but really demands more than one viewing and some knowledge of history. In this respect it resembles Akira Kurasawa's masterpiece ""The Seven Samurai.The cast includes John Lone as emperor Pu Yi, Joan Chen, and Peter O'Toole.The film won 9 Oscars including best director and best film. A must see on DVD widescreen or in the theater.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Last Epic,"The Last Emperor, like Once Upon a Time in America, is an epic saga that delves, among various aspects, into the realm of Time and the ensuing effects it has on a human being and his culture as it passes through his lifetime.  The Last Emperor of the Qing dynasty, Pu-Yi, was coronated in 1909 at the age of three and due to his youth ended up being a puppet to his adminstration. Bertolucci successfully shows us a young man who while understandably spoilt by many luxuries of monarchy, is in actuality a tender hearted, independent thinker (not doer) who is passionate about his homeland (Manchuria) and has a ravenous desire for experiencing life in the outside world.  His caged lifestyle in the Forbidden City (Beijing) is definitely a major contributor to this mindset.  From his infancy the director takes us through a chain of historical events that ultimately lead to Pu-Yi being an ordinary man (we know this from the beginning, however flashbacks explain his situation at the start).  However, it is not the desired lifestyle that he sought as an Emperor in his youth.The Last Emperor is breathtaking in its cinematography and Bertolucci's direction is impeccable.  A lot of criticism was directed at his film '1900' (1976) due to its sheer length.  The Last Emperor clocks in at 215 minutes (director's cut) and barring 10 minutes of a marriage related scene, it never lets up.  Bertolucci seamlessly interweaves the flashbacks with Pu-Yi's situation in post-WWII China by providing us with a real life tragedy that epitomizes human weaknesses, vices, love and loyalty.  Here is a film that is a true story but goes beyond mere narration or simple depiction - it is a three and a half hour, non-stop attention grasping journey through the spectrum of humanity that defines our lifetime through the eyes of an unfortunate soul who was a victim of circumstances like many are.  Any questions that the viewer will have concerning an event in the plot will be immediately answered through the rich tapestry that Bertolucci shows when depicting Pu-Yi's imperial life.On a technical note, the acting in this film is brilliant.  John Lone deserved atleast an Oscar nomination for best actor due to his seamless portrayal of Pu-Yi.  He makes his portrayal of a 21 - 60 year old Pu-Yi seem like an effortless act. Through his performance the audience feels an even greater compassion for the last emperor as we come across a man who despite all the hardships he endured was very compassionate and soft centered. The sheer down to earth nature of his character as a 55-60 year old who walks with a tired smile, forever accompanied by his loving brother, is a testament to Lone's ability to portray any age and move the audience.Once again, it takes a Hailey's comet like event for the Academy to nominate someone from the eastern world (or non-British, non-American when it comes to best actor).  The rest of the cast is also brilliant barring Ryuichi Sakamoto (who portrays the one-armed Masahiko Amakasu) who, for the most part, presents us with a classic display of Japanese overacting.  Although I wouldn't call it overacting in a Kurasawa-esque/Japanese film environment, it becomes quite hilarious in a production such as this.This apart, the film is brilliant.  It is the last great epic (yes, Gladiator is very good, but is far from an epic in my mind) and somehow I hope it is rediscovered and re-appreciated as it once was back in the late eighties.While the Oscars have always contrived to ignore the true best picture for most of the last two decades, here is an example of a best picture winner which beat the competition by miles.",10.0,Anonymous,History
My brief review of the film,"A well done and fascinating, but long and poorly explained biopic - compressing sixty years of history and politics into two and a half hours will be at least a bit overwhelming for a viewer who is not familiar with the topic to understand. However, in terms of art direction, costumes and acting the film is definitely fine. Lone is entirely convincing at the title person from young adulthood to old age, and O'Toole is good as his tutor. But the overarching problem with the film is that all this history is presented without much explanation making the film a far from satisfying watch, even if one with many cinematic virtues.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I love this movie,"I saw this movie at the cinema when I was 17 years old. I was completely overwhelmed by the movie (I already had a fascination for China) that I decided to visit china in 1992 just to see the forbidden palace (and the rest of China of course).The music in the movie is brilliant, the cinematography outstanding, the story very moving (the end of the movie broke my heart).Don´t expect an action-packed or high paced movie and be ready to sit through 3+ hours. If you´re all that, it might be worth a look for you as well:)",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Life Of China's Last Emperor,"This is somewhat long and generally lacking in excitement, but it's beautifully filmed and it serves as a fascinating look at the life of Pu Yi - the last Emperor of China, who came to the throne in 1908 when he was three years old, and finally died in 1967 as a gardener in Communist China, after serving 10 years in a PRC prison being ideologically ""re- educated."" Much of the story is told in flash-backs taken from his interrogation by Communist officials in the PRC prison. Much attention is paid to Reginald Johnston's book ""Twilight in the Forbidden City."" Johnston (played in the movie by Peter O'Toole) was Pu Yi's Scottish tutor.John Lone's performance as Pu Yi was very good. Not surprising perhaps for someone who became an emperor at such a young age, Pu Yi is depicted as one who is used to comfort and used to having his way - a characteristic he seems to have retained for most of his life, although he doesn't really come across as bad or arrogant; just as someone who never learned how to care for himself or treat others as equals. I suppose it would be hard to expect a child who was treated almost like a god from the age of 3 to grow up psychologically well adjusted. He was actually overthrown not much more than a decade after coming to the throne but I appreciated learning that although he abdicated when the Nationalist revolution took place, he retained his title and it seems as though the Forbidden City remained his ""Empire."" He continued to rule this little enclave within Beijing, much as the Pope rules a little enclave within Rome. That was very interesting.There was a lot of attention to Pu Yi's accession as ""Emperor of Manchukuo"" in 1934. He became a puppet of the Japanese, who placed him on the throne to give Manchukuo a semblance of credibility but no freedom, was captured by the Soviets at the end of the war, and finally handed over to PRC officials in 1950, his transfer to Chinese authority being where the movie begins.Near the end of the movie there's a truly fascinating scene depicting a small portion of the work of Mao's ""Red Guards"" during the so-called Cultural Revolution that was quite sobering. I was disappointed, though, with the way this ended. It chose to conclude on a sort of fantasy scene, where Pu Yi returns to the Forbidden City. I suppose it was meant as a way of saying that at his death he returned home, but I found it a weak ending rather than a heartwarming one, perhaps because while his life was interesting, I can't say that I developed any warm feelings or sympathy for Pu Yi by watching this.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Heaven's Mandate,"Back when I was a university student studying a course in the Far East  we learned the term 'Heaven's Mandate'. It was said that when one  dynasty overthrew another, the mandate from powers above to rule China  had been lost and a new mandate was given to the winners. It was a self  fulfilling idea because if the Mings went out and the Manchus went in  it was because the Manchus now had the Mandate.  The Last Emperor is the story of Young emperor Pu Yi who was the last  Manchu Emperor, crowned at the age of 3 in 1908 and removed in 1911  during the revolution. Pu Yi spent half the rest of his life trying to  gain that back and the other half trying to roll with the punches for  making some very bad choices in trying for the former. By that time if  you want to extend the idea, the mandate now fell to Mao Tse-tung and  the Chinese Communists.  Still very few people had as colorful, as tumultuous, and as epic a  life as Pu Yi as portrayed by Chinese actor John Lone. Whatever else Pu  Yi was, he was a survivor and maybe if he hasn't got Heaven's mandate  any more, he's at least got a heavenly place.  From 1911 until he was kicked out, the young Emperor was still  permitted to run a kind of fairyland kingdom in the Forbidden City area  of Peking which was the exclusive domain of the Chinese Emperors for  centuries. During that time he had an English tutor in Peter O'Toole,  the one major occidental player in The Last Emperor. The relationship  here is similar to the one shown in Seven Years In Tibet between Brad  Pitt as Heinrich Harrer and the young Dalai Lama. Here though the  emphasis is on the pupil not the tutor.  The Last Emperor is an epic international achievement, not possible  during the years of Mao Tse-tung's rule. As a film it received great  international respect winning nine Oscars including Best Picture and  Best Director for Bernardo Bertolucci. That's quite a mandate in and of  itself.  Though the film is more than two and half hours long I guarantee your  interest will not flag. And it really is worth it to see at the very  end the elderly Emperor's meeting with the new Red Guards of Mao's  Cultural Revolution and that bit of symbolism with the cricket.  Absolutely priceless, just as the film is.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty good,"A pretty good film, well worth watching. There is a lot that is superlative here, Peter O'Toole's acting, the magnificent cinematography, Bertolucci's direction, etc. But I didn't find it to be great. Perhaps that's just from my perspective as an Occidental. I haven't researched what other films were nominated for Best Picture that year, but I would likely have voted for a different one. The film exposes the cruelty of the Japanese of those times, but completely glosses over the cruelty of the Chinese Communist Party. I suppose that was necessary in order to film in China.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Great looking but also supremely boring,"The Last Emperor was a movie that has been on my watchlist for many, many years. I finally sat down to watch it and I was very excited to do so. But unfortunately I was severely disappointed with this movie. First of all, it looked fantastic and as authentic as possible. I was amazed by the scenery and that it was actually shot in the Forbidden Palace. In terms of scale it can compete with any epic out there as there are tonnes of extras used and the sets are very impressive. Everything is so meticulously made and visually stunning that it is a shame that the movie was so supremely boring.The story of the last emperor of China is fascinating but this movie goes out of its way to make it as uninteresting as it can. Whenever something started to grip me, the movie quickly went back to doing something that had my attention waver again. The characters are underdeveloped and I did not care about anything that happened to anyone. The last half hour of the movie would've packed a hell of a punch if I cared about what was happening. I'm not a fan of Bertolucci necessarily and I think in the hands of another director this films might've been better. I was thinking of Zhang Yimou and his brilliant movies Raise the Red Lantern and especially To Live. That latter movie is a Chinese historical epic that is fantastic and Yimou maybe could've elevated The Last Emperor if he was the one directing it. The movie lacked the emotional appeal of Yimou's movies or something like Farewell My Concubine which is yet another Chinese epic that is done much better. I even thought about how someone like Cecil B. DeMille would've handled this material if he were to make it back in the day (obviously this wasn't possible). The movie would've definitely had less accuracy but it would've been more fun.Another aspect that I didn't like is that the movie is in English. The way the characters spoke made it seem as if they were dubbed and maybe they were. I haven't checked but it sounded fake and inauthentic. Having the movie be done in Chinese would've been much more effective. Aside from that the performances were fine but didn't click for me as much as they would if they were done in Chinese. In the end, the only thing that I can praise about this movie is its scale, look and very impressive sets. Everything else about it however, was very underwhelming and whilst watching it I only kept thinking of how it could've been so much more. Worth watching only for the spectacle and I doubt I will ever re-visit it.",5.0,Anonymous,History
And the moral of the story is .......,"This to me was a very powerful movie, I loved the story, and the final outcome was how it should be. Somehow we believe that Kings, Queens, Emperors etc are entitled to their power, that somehow they deserve it. This is how this emperor saw himself, he believed he was better, and above the average person, his sense of entitlement and view of reality was so perverted, that he did everything possible to retain and regain his position in life. However from the day he entered the palace he was a pawn, powerless to act, yet he never sees this. Maybe we don't all understand his re-education, but this is what makes the ending so great. There is a fantastic moral to this story. A beautiful story, sad, moving, and somehow, strangely uplifting. Highly recommended. 9/10",,Anonymous,History
A sweeping epic,"Every time I mention to someone that I hadn't seen The Last Emperor, the first reaction is disbelief, and the second is `It is such a good movie'. And indeed it was.  I'm not sure what the non-director's cut was, because the version I saw was the director's cut, but it was absolutely fantastic. Not once did I think that the nearly four hour run time was too long because the story was so compelling, the direction brilliant and the acting engaging.  I find it hard to believe that it took me this long to see this film, and I also find it hard to believe it is not in the IMDB Top 250.  Its Best Picture and Director honors were well-deserved, and the Oscar-winning score is amazing.  I'll admit that I was left hanging a bit in regard to the Emperor's wife, but that is the only thing that I can remotely find slightly lacking in this film.  An outstanding film, The Last Emperor is entertaining, informative and important.--Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,History
Could have been better.,"A generally quite interesting film. I very much liked the cinematography and use of colours, from the warm gold and red past to the drab green and grey and dull blue look of the present. You are slightly distracted by the fact it's all in English but that was how many foreign set films were done back then. The music and costumes and set design are all excellent, overall it's an interesting story though it lost me at certain points and I'd argue it loses it's way a bit. Quite a lot of history ends up being covered.Even for someone interested in the history of this period the film still didn't have enough in it for me to really get into the story.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Long and well worth every moment,"The last Emperor of China, Pu Yi, we now understand, was never anything more than a puppet. He wielded absolute power within his real realm -- a gilded cage of a palace -- but could never shape events except for tragedy to himself or to others.We see his life as one unlikely person, the one person that one would have most expect to have been insulated, in a gigantic tragedy -- that of China between the chaotic beginning of what might have been a long reign and the destructive Cultural Revolution of Mao, with coups, warlord rule, World War II, and the Marxist Revolution culminating in the rise of Mao. One recognizes that the pathologies of imperial China never truly died, but merely took new forms in the cult of the Leader. That the scenery is beautiful and hedonism among elites is rife hardly conceals the fact that China was a political Hell.Pu Yi, once the Emperor of the great (but decrepit) Chinese Empire, becomes Emperor of the Forbidden Palace in 1912 before he is expelled in one of many violent revolutions (this one in 1925) in China. We see him doing a few things right, like reforming the Palace bureaucracy from a den of thieves into something honorable. He gets a superb adviser in Reginald Johnston, who gave him the confidence to be a political figure -- even a good one -- in the happiest time of his life. Johnston leaves as Pu Yi is expelled from the Palace, and eventually falls under the spell of the Japanese, who rip Manchuria from China and find someone willing to rule it in an enlightened manner -- himself. The Prime Minister of his choosing is killed, and Pu Yi becomes a puppet ruler of a contemptible entity. It's just like the old days, only the intriguers are worse -- far worse. The decrepitude of the system sets in at the first moment. As Emperor he can only accede to what his Japanese overlords demand.At the end of the war he is arrested by the Soviets because he dallies too long on unfinished business -- and after the 1949 Revolution he is sent back to China as a war criminal and traitor. Rather than being executed (as one might expect) he is sent to prison as a convict.As a prisoner he is incarcerated with some of his former underlings -- war criminals of the Manchukuo puppet state -- who have learned to ape the ideology of their captors, and he runs afoul of those 'fellow' inmates. Ex-fascists make the most fervent communists. All in all, he simplifies and becomes a very ordinary man in a society that punished anyone who challenged anything that the regime didn't want people to challenge.Pure puppet? Not quite. A dupe who never left when the going was good -- if the going was ever good -- and that is exactly what the Imperial role made him. In childhood the ruler of the greatest empire (in population size, that is) on Earth -- in a premature old age, a cipher. Then again, what else did most Chinese ever become in China during the first two thirds of the 20th century become -- ciphers, old before their time, wrecks of no fault of their own, just to survive.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An ornamental theory to tell the story of an ambitious emperor who did not deserve it.,"The Last Emperor (1987) :
Brief Review -An ornamental theory to tell the story of an ambitious emperor who did not deserve it. The Last Emperor suggests very much by its title that it is a story of the Last Emperor of the Forbidden City, China who was nothing but an ambitious child who cultivated his own empire, reformed it and destroyed it too. The inception of an idea that he's an Emperor and he can do anything he wishes was done when he was just 3 years old but by the time he grows he finds himself trapped in World War and Republication of China and Japan. The story doesn't really offer anything extraordinary in terms of writing skills but it had to be honest to the available data even if it doesn't fit really in any cinematic or dramatic proportions. And anyways it doesn't really connect to the audience who doesn't know or care much about China and Japan's history. Well, i am one of them. Besides, i had to like to it as a Cinematic achievement, that's a fact. Director Bernardo Bertolucci delivers a very much watchable and interesting film using all the cinematic properties like locations, screenplay, production design, cinematography and gripping storytelling in systematic manners. The performances looked convincing and so does the characters, doesn't matter of they don't stay in memory by the time film ends. It's about spending those 160 minutes without feeling lazy and The Last Emperor succeeds in keeping the laziness away. Overall, it's a very good biopic and even a Fantastic must watch but only if you care so much about China or Puyi's history. Biographies are meant to rule Oscars and this just got lucky otherwise who cares about this film as we do for other memorable Classics.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",7.0,Anonymous,History
This Film Can Be Fascinating!,"If you can sit through this movie, especially the three and a half version of this film, I am proud of you. Not to say this movie is bad, but it's often tedious since there is really nothing here to move the plot. The film goes at such a slow pace, but however this film can be incredibly fascinating and the film is enriched with detail. As a history buff, I enjoyed this film as it was because of the historical narrative it induced.Bernardo Bertollucci's film is about the last emperor of China before the warlord age and communist age. The film talks about how Puyi became emperor at such an young age, how he abdicated this throne, and how he ended up as a political prisoner.The acting is really good and we needed good acting to get through a film like this. John Lone does an excellent job as the adult Puyi and really conveys his emotions very well. Peter O'Toole, one of the few Western actors here, does an excellent job as always.Overall, The Last Emperor seems like it does not have in mind to entertain, but to teach. It's a good, fascinating film that talks about changing times and how people must adapt. I was intrigued by this film because the dynasties of China has always impressed me. Is this the film that should win Best Picture at the Oscars? Perhaps not, but this is still a good film to see despite it's tepid pacing. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Great art, great vision, but not great film entertainment.","The life and times of Pu Yi, the boy Emperor of China whose life-of-destiny was overtaken over by the Chinese Cultural Revolution.This is one of the most difficult movies I have ever had to review because, while I cannot ignore the majestic flow and vision of the film and the man mountain of film awards, I also cannot also ignore my own heart and aching bottom. While I can quote clichés about the ""meaning of film"" all day long, I believe that all movies (whatever the aims and nature) should be enjoyable while watching them and you shouldn't be glad when the final credits roll - indeed you should be sad!Bernardo Bertolucci believes that cinema is mostly vision and atmosphere - and believe me he is master of his limited focus - but there is also a need for a story. Something that passes him by. If we are lucky a story that changes pace, informs, excites and thrills.This film has moments that will stay in the memory forever and when I first saw them as TV clips I thought ""this is going to be something else - an epic."" However they are simply impressive props and backdrops for a story that would be better told as a documentary.The film opens up on the story of a little boy born with a destiny. Not many people are born with a destiny outside of royalty and they should be treat with sympathy because, while they may seem fated, they also live in a gilded cage. Even if history had not taken over events Pi would have lived a life of quiet impotence - despite the title he would have had no powers and would have had no influence on his countries' affairs. A living and breathing statue. The revolution probably did him the best favour that he ever had.I always think that a life spent on holiday is most intelligent person's version of hell. A life spent on holiday while trapped inside a prison camp must be the worst. Filming took place in the real Forbidden City, but I am not that impressed by it. It could have been built in a studio and we would not have known. Vast amounts of money have been spent and it is all up there on the screen, but that, by itself, doesn't really impress me.I won't go through the changes in the Emperor's life on a stage-by-stage basis (as so many have done) because that would take away some of few things that will carry you through the (very long) movie.It is a comment on the nature of this film that people are quite happy to explain it scene-by-scene as if this doesn't take away anything from it. It does and frankly does a disservice to the film or maybe this is one of these ""great art pieces"" in which such spoiler rules don't apply.Bernardo Bertolucci is pretty overrated as a director and as a story teller he couldn't work on TV. He is a bit of a fossil in that he takes hours to say what could be said in five minutes. The acting is steady, and in Peter O'Toole we have excellence, but I couldn't get inside anybody - they either had a brown nosing or duty-to-do role and no-one is really allowed to be themselves. The acting is - in the main - cold and seems swamped by the oriental mysticism that the director wants us to bath in.This is an important film and well worth seeing, but I wasn't entertained and after the opening - which looks at a unique childhood - I became bored and restless. Usually childhood is most boring part of any biography and the story usually picks up when they take up the sword of whatever made them famous. Here we have boy/man on the road to nowhere or nothing. A sad tale of a boy/man who seemed to have everything but in fact had nothing.Sorry, I was left with a numb brain and a numb bottom - and I didn't even see the ""long"" version!

Lush and opulent but disappointing epic spectacle,"This is a legendary grand cinematic epic, this time focused on the People's Republic of China, the nation's history portrayed through the changing fortunes of its tragic final emperor, a puppet occupying a position only of ceremonial significance. It has wonderful authentic costumes and thousands of extras, permission being granted for its filming within the Forbidden City itself, a huge imperial complex of 250 acres. However, it's a film that disappointed me personally. I found it both confusing at the time and forgettable long term.The film relates China's history through the prism of its last emperor, Pu Yi...his birth, brief childhood reign after being crowned emperor at age three, captivity in his own palace, taking of both a wife and a concubine, abdication and decline into a dissolute lifestyle, exploitation by the Japanese as emperor of Manchuguo, re education by the Communists, life as a regular peasant in the People's Republic and death as a humble gardener in Peking's Botanical Gardens.My main complaint, lacking much personal knowledge of the history, is confusion as to the story, especially given the story telling method of both flash back and flash forward. It was all very artistic as opposed to informative, and presumed a considerable background knowledge of Chinese history on the part of the viewer. Although the film painted a vivid and compelling portrait of this tragic historical figure for me at the time, the images left me soon after I departed the theatre so something must have been lacking.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Solid but definitely too long,"The last emperor won 9 oscars including Best Picture. I cannot see that. The costume design is good, realistic in my opinion, so therefore the oscar is earned.

Once Upon a Time on the East,"Best movie about the East I've ever seen.The credo of many famous western movies (from ""Die Hard"" to ""Truman show"") is a lonely hero who challenges fate or numerous ""bad guys"". He usually wins on the screen. Unfortunately, it rarely happens in real life. Especially, on the East.Six years ago I thought about this movie as a metaphor of ""history-person"" relations. Past and present of my birthplace (Russia) is exceptionally rich with biographies of worthy people that have become puppets in the hands of history or some dictator (e.g.Stalin).Now a ""parallel"" interpretation arose. We can think also about ""fate-person"" relations. Our fate is often personalized by the forces of subconscious. Historical and subconscious forces have much in common. Both are very strong and tend to provocation. An attempt to beat them often comes to end in the same way as the attempt of Pu Yi to ""use Japan"". In both cases, information that we have in our struggle is extremely restricted.The last remark. We had all been Emperors in early childhood. Then we've been overthrown and it's impossible to return the Kingdom. I wonder, why the Scotland tutor haven't told it to Pu Yi?",,Anonymous,History
Film-making at Its Best; Great Historical Recreation,"I found I could not take my eyes off this film for many reasons. The first is a view of a culture we in the West don't understands. Tradition is at the center of everything and the Emperor is in the middle of it all. Now add the circumstances of the reign. First of all, the great and powerful Emperor can't leave the forbidden city. He is pursued by people willing to die for him, though many are crooks and people of questionable character. You then add the maturity level of the boy given this title Obviously, he has no tools to do what he is supposed to do. His divine right makes it a zoo in the palace. He is attracted to Western culture and want so badly to be a celebrity playing outside the walls of his imposed exile. He gets in bed with the Japanese because it gives him an opportunity to regain power but pretty much brings his undoing. I can't begin to explain all the elements in this film that are so impressive. Others can do that so much better. The incredible time shifts from his incarceration and ""confession"" to a time in China when so much ""strange"" stuff was going on is portrayed so well. There aren't many three hour plus movies I will watch a second time, but this is one of them. The performances by all are so striking. Peter O'Toole is outstanding, as are all the incarnations of the Emperor. This really deserved its Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Visually opulent and arresting,"I can say very little about The Last Emperor that hasn't been said already, though it is for me my favourite Bertolucci film along with Last Tango in Paris.The Last Emperor is a visually opulent film. The cinematography is stunning, as are the scenery, editing, costumes and sets. In fact, it is one of the most visually beautiful films I've seen, and I've seen a lot. Not only that, it wonderfully juxtaposes the pre and pro-revolutionary Chinese worlds.The music is beautiful and adds to the charm of the film as well as having an authentic flavour. Bertolucci's direction is superb, the story is engrossing and I rarely found it dull over the (almost) 3 hour duration and the dialogue is thought-provoking.The acting is most excellent. John Lone is truly remarkable in the lead, it is a very difficult and multifaceted role and he copes brilliantly with it. Also remarkable, perhaps even more so, is the great Peter O'Toole, whose is very charming, graceful and eloquent.Overall, a beautiful and arresting film, one I found myself admiring rather than adoring first time, but now it is becoming a favourite. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good,"In my opinion this movie is good, but not great. I saw it years ago - but forgot I'd seen it. Now, on DVD re watching it - I decided to review it.I think it's a good movie. It is a beautiful movie. But it simply is not great now. Regarding the time it was made ('86-'87) it was probably great. I read several glowing reviews - but all the 5 to 7 star reviews mostly say the same thing I found issue with - the way the movie goes back and forth between the times of Puyi's life. And also how the film is shown seems to infer that I know some of this history.So, I momentarily stopped watching at about 20 minutes in. I researched Puyi and his history, which is also somewhat confusing - he is both a good & bad guy, a victim of circumstances but by necessity a manipulator - all at the same time - basically trying to stay alive. It certainly is very interesting to try to imagine & understand that he saw & lived this unique childhood & history in his short life.Unfortunately, my major problem with this movie was my DVD - no captions. And a lot of the dialogue was either mumbled or in Manchu or something. I don't know why the film makers didn't at least caption those words!I also think this movie could've benefited vastly by having narration. Someone explaining the story so when the decades change back & forth the story teller/narrator explains some background of what's going on.I wish they would remaster it with a really great narrator.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Mystifying and Glorious,"This is a film that is unfairly ignored in the list of the best films ever made. Despite receiving nine Oscars it 1989, it receives little to no attention. There are a few reasons I can think of off the top of my head. The first is that it is a slower and longer movie, and there is not a lot of action or melodrama to break it up, turning off some people. The second is that it was made by Bernado Bertolucci, who is not particularly well-liked in Hollywood for reasons that date back to the movie that made him famous, The Last Tango in Paris, as well as for his hatred of the system.But it is nonetheless one of the most striking and evocative historical epics ever put to film. Some films are ashamed to be connected with actual history. While this is not inherently negative, there is something to be said about a film embracing the history that inspired it. Art and history are often at each other's throats, but they do not have to be. One can piggyback off the other.The only film I can compare to this is Lawrence of Arabia. That film is slightly better than this one, but both are sprawling epics that make you feel like you're in the front of a roller-coaster that's rushing through the past. While that film is more ambitious and better-acted, I actually personally prefer this one more. It's involving and atmospheric and one of the best-shot movies of the century. Every time I pop it in, I am enraptured.There is so much work put into every scene. The makeup, the art direction, the style; this is dedication incarnate. The Last Emperor is like The Lord of the Rings or Titanic: you may not like these movies, but you have to respect how much work went into them on every front imaginable. There are times when I can't believe what I'm seeing wasn't made for quick on the computer, but then I notice how real it all seems.The plot is simple and not the focus. John Lone (as well as a few other actors of varying age) plays Puyi, the titular 'Last Emperor'. Taking the throne as a toddler, Puyi is sheltered from the rapidly changing world around him until he can be sheltered no more and is thrown from power by the Chinese Communists, who take him to a 'political rehabilitation' camp.A lot happens in this movie, but there are not a lot of twists and turns. You just sink in to the movie, sink in to this atmosphere. Breathe in, breathe out. Some people might be bored, but the movie is not boring. Sixty years are covered; sixty of the most interesting years in history. That is not just enough to fill three hours; that is enough to make those three hours interesting. This is the kind of film that you originally only plan to throw on for an hour or so at a time, but grabs you and pulls you in and persuades you watch the rest of it.Interesting fact: this film did not even enter the top 5 at the box office until its twenty-second weekend of release, the weekend after it won Best Picture. That is... really rare. I know this was the eighties, when films hung around the box office as long as that wet smell hangs around a dog, but this was still not common in the least. If not for this unexpected boost, it would be alongside The English Patient, Amadeus, and The Hurt Locker.I cannot believe a film like this was independently funded, but it was. I don't know which is more incredible, the fact that they were able to reach 23.8 million in funds or that a film of this scale was made for that cost. Either way, the fact that this film exists is almost as remarkable as the film itself.Almost.What I love most about this film is how it is able to make you feel a rainbow of emotions by doing very little. The acting and the camera work and the music make you feel what the character is feeling without having to sit through gobs of unnecessary dialogue. There are few better cases for the power of cinema than The Last Emperor.You feel how sheltered he is, and how utopic they are trying to make the palace. You feel how depressed and trapped he is, especially as he grows older. You feel how confused and angered he is when he is forced by his advisors to adopt the old customs even as the world is rapidly changing. You feel his disappointment as he is deprived of a chance to rule just as he is shaped into a good ruler.And without those gobs of unnecessary dialogue, time is freed up for important things, like fleshing out the world in which Puyi lives. With all the clever behind-the-camera work, it doesn't quite feel like a real place but rather like a enhanced, dreamy version of a real place, which I think the effect that they were going for. If it wasn't, then the people who made this stumbled onto genius: this pseudo-surreality makes it seem like a vision that is receding with every passing day, that is quickly fading out of the present into the history books.Kudos to the filmmakers for bringing this story to the masses. Double kudos for going all out and sparing no expense. Triple kudos for making one of the best films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,History

the isolation of a simple man in times of change,"Bernardo Bertolucci's The Last Emperor is a glorious epic that almost should be made for someone of a higher stature. In a sense all of the visual splendor that Bertolucci, DP Vittorio Storaro, and all the costume and set and art designers- not to mention the Forbidden Kingdom itself- are a contradiction on a man who spent his life more or less as a prisoner, either by birth or by choice. He was taken from his mother at a very young age, still practically an infant, and basically given an empire, with many servants waiting at any and all command.But then Pu Yi was given an empire that was crumbling due to the historical shift from power of empire to republic, and he became only important as an obscure figurehead in a society that kept him away. Until he was 18 or 19, when he was forcibly ejected from the Forbidden Kingdom by a new system, his whole upbringing was warped. This led then to becoming, by something of his choice (though, as with any drug like the devil opium from his homeland, something he wanted without knowing all the consequences), an installed 'puppet' emperor. And, finally, this led to a real prison, albeit one with a far greater existential means to an end.What Bertolucci charts, brilliantly, is what a man of royalty becomes when he has no power, no real influence (and, if any, as a pawn figurehead for the Japanese), and most importantly with very few actual emotional connections. There's a wet nurse, there's a wife (or two, briefly), and R.J. (Peter O'Toole), but in general there's very little Pu Yi can cling to. It's rather staggering to boot since the director is not entirely after a political message- Maoists are seen as just another wave, towards the end of the film, that's stemmed from the protesters from earlier in the late 1910's- but more-so about what Pu Yi's purpose is in life without real freedom. There are escapist pleasures, like being a Playboy, and even as a puppet emperor there's some escapist element from the gravity of the real situations he's not aware of. As the director said once about the character, which makes some good sense, is that he's a 'Peter Pan character', and with change being reflected as something that goes on to far greater lengths around him than in himself.But is this a Peter Pan story or film? Not quite; it's one of those grandly filmed historical dramas that does the rare step of choosing character over plot (this despite the fact that Bertolucci jumps back and forth between the 1950s prison and the history), but at the same time everything goes like clockwork, staggeringly at times, in terms of the production values. Almost by luck, like with the scenes with little Pu Yi, there's some awesome cinema captured in the unexpected, as the colors spring out, sumptuously, with themes that are quite internal and deeply felt. He also has the luck of having John Lone playing, for the most part, Pu Yi from young adult to old man, a presence that often hides back his true isolation with the markings of a man who's not as strong as he thinks he is (this despite how he acts with his wives, and how he is around the wise and caring Johnston, played by a perfectly cast O'Toole). Lone makes the character sympathetic in ways that would be trickier for a less adept actor with those subtle moments of anguish.Worth seeing for sure in full widescreen, preferably the remastered Criterion where everything's crisp as bacon, it's one of the best films of 1987, and it challenges the perception of the typical 'costume epic'; beneath the veneer of the hundreds and hundreds of extras, the atmosphere behind the walls of the Kingdom or at the prison, and in all the carefully orchestrated moments, there's questions about the nature of power and change in contexts political and personal.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Spectacular epic detailing life of Pu Yi, crowned at the age of three as the last emperor before the onset of communism.","This splendid film shot on location inside the Republic of China starts in Peking, 1908. The child Pu Yi is taken to the Forbidden City, where the elderly Empress proclaims the child as the future emperor of China. So before the dying Empress Dowager the child is proclaimed Emperor. Follows Pu Yi from childhood to manhood (sequestered away in the Forbidden City) to fugitive to puppet-ruler to party proletariat . Much of his story is told starting in 1950 when he is in detention under the rule of the Communist Party of China. The film shows many historical events: the establishment of the Republic of China in 1911, the overthrow of Emperor Pu Yi, the Japanese capture of Manchukuo, (1937) the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, the massacre of the Chinese capital of Nanking, the appointment of Pu Yi as Emperor of Manchukuo, the Second World War (1939-1945), the Chinese Civil War (1945-1949) between the Nationalists led by Chiang Kai-shek and the Communists led by Mao Tse Tung. Mao's takeover of China and the subsequent repression, including the Great Leap Forward and the ""Cultural Revolution"" with the young Red Guards punishing all kinds of people who did not follow Maoist guidelines.Deeply ironic epic detailing historic events in which Bernardo Bertolucci masterfully recreates the life of Pu Yi, who was crowned as a child and ended his eventful life as a gardener, after having witnessed the collapse of the empire, encounters and disagreements with his people and stays in re-education prisons. After tough negotiations with the Chinese Government - which never looked favourably on the film - the film crew managed to shoot for the first time in the grounds of the Forbidden City, which gave added value to an already legendary film, one of the most beautiful films shot in the turbulent 20th century. However, it is too long, with more than half an hour left, including some superfluous images and incidents. The script was written by Bertolucci and his wife Mark People, and is based on the autobiography ""From Emperor to Citizen, The Autobiography of Aisin-Gioro Pu Yi"".A luxurious movie with rich and visually stunning set pieces ana authentic costumes. Adding a cast of thousands , including as follows John Lone as the famous emperor, Peter O'Tooñe as portrays competently the sympathetic tutor who educates to the adult Pu Yi in the ways of the western world after he abdicates in 1912, Victor Wong, Dennis Dun, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Maggie Han, Ric Young, Vivian Wu, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, among others.Deservedly awarded 9 Oscars (including best film: director Bertolucci , adapted screenplay: Mark Peploe , photography: Vittorio Storaro, costumes:James Acheson , editing Gabriella Cristiani , and soundtrack: Ryuichi Sakamoto who also has a role and David Byrne from Talking Heads), as well as 4 Golden Globes (dramatic film, director, screenplay, and original soundtrack) and countless other awards that contibuted to the big hit.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Grand in scope, intimate in detail","I think it is the quiet moments that stay with me from this film; the empress shutting the door the final time, Pu Yi gardening, or RJ riding the bike is almost more vivid than the epic scenes in retrospect. This is the testament to the film's, especially the screenplay, of anchoring such a big story in the little details. The first time I watched the film I knew nothing of the history but the writing was strong enough that I able to following the political intrigue and the personal story of life long prisoner. The script does a remarkable job balancing the flash backs and telling the story of Pu Yi's last ordeal in political rehabilitation.Now, don't get me wrong the film is absolutely grand in places. The cinematography especially is beautiful. Further, it has a little bit of color coding. (i.e. the rehabilitation prison is washed out blue and grey, the Forbidden City is gold and black, etc.) to help orientate the viewer. The resulting effect is a long intimate film with vistas of mood and passion.This is rather a sad story. The film embraces that to its merit. Great film.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"A film like this comes along in 10,000 years","Bernardo Bertolucci left a remarkable impression on the Academy with The Last Emperor, taking away nine oscars including one for best film and best director.  This film will leave a lasting impression on those who view it as well.  Last Emperor provides a strong message through its main character Pu-Yi.  Although the film bases its story on the true life accounts of the last emperor of China, Last Emperor shows that life can deal one undesirable circumstances and the way one reacts and handles these circumstances determine one's place in history.  Bertolucci's powerful method of storytelling also further enhances the greatness of Last Emperor.   The motif of pursuing a forbidden love that remains out of reach presents a tearful message.  Who cannot get misty eyed seeing an eight year old Pu-Yi chasing after his beloved nanny or an almost exact similar scene when a much older Pu-Yi chases his  insane first wife?

old fashion epic,"Pu Yi (John Lone) is the last Emperor of China. The movie flashes back and forth from as a post-war prisoner to his life leading up to that moment. In 1908, he is taken from his home and transferred to the Hidden City. When the Dowager dies, he becomes the emperor. He's separated from his mother for years and his younger brother Pu Chieh comes to stay with him. He becomes obsolete as a child emperor when the country turns into a Republic. R.J. Johnston (Peter O'Toole) is his English tutor and mentor. Pu Yi is locked in even when his mother dies. He has an arranged marriage to Wan Jung (Joan Chen) and Wenxiu. In 1924, he is expelled from the Forbidden City. He lived in luxury with his entourage. Wenxiu gets her divorce. Japanese agent Eastern Jewel entices Wan Jung with opium while Pu Yi is pulled ever closer to Japan. He is eventually installed as the emperor of Manchukuo, a puppet state of Japan.It's a grand epic historical drama. John Lone delivers a stone-faced performance. It has a certain appeal and makes the emperor more of a victim of history. It's a specific take on the character which some may object to. It's actually quite compelling. The picture looks beautiful.

China changed drastically while he remained behind the Forbidden City walls such that he never realized he was essentially powerless.While the movie was following this last emperor it was also following China's travails.

"Beautiful, but flawed","A fascinating historical figure, but a mediocre, grossly overrated movie, with all the signs of a foreigner telling a Chinese story. That started with the characters all speaking English instead of Chinese, which was seriously irritating in its own right, but more so when one realizes that for at least some of the actors, like Victor Wong, they affected accents that they didn't have in real life. Secondly, for all its grandeur, there is the feeling of exoticism in lots of little things, like the whole turtle in the soup, a servant being tasked with smelling the royal doo-doo, the wet nurse providing her breasts to both Puyi the big boy (and the viewer), or the imagined lesbian relationship from a disaffected wife. Bertolucci wasn't interested in cultural authenticity in the slightest.Toss in Reginald Johnston (Peter O'Toole), the Scottish tutor with a calm voice of reason, perhaps not quite a full-blown white savior, but close, essentially advocating ""civilization"" and progress, while towering physically over those in court. The real man was quite different, both in mannerisms and political views, but his flawed historical account partially served as the basis for the screenplay. The rest was gleaned from the autobiography of Puyi himself (John Lone), but this was written after he had gone through the wringer in a communist reeducation camp, and under close governmental supervision, making it unreliable at best.That brings me to another of Bertolucci's sins, the softball positions he takes on the prison camps as well as the Cultural Revolution which followed. The real horrors of these things, both in terms of how they affected Puyi and China generally, are seriously downplayed. That could have been due to naivete, Bertolucci's own communist beliefs, or perhaps quid pro quo for being allowed to film on location in the Forbidden City, a first for a Western filmmaker. Regardless, it's a much bigger problem than the oft-cited historical inaccuracies of Puyi treatment of his court eunuchs, which was considerably more cruel.Even if I could set aside the cultural and historical problems, the narrative itself sprawls, and became less interesting once the action shifted out of the Forbidden City. At least told in the way it was, I don't think the film needed or deserved 163 minutes. There is a sense of a tragic figure in this impotent and humiliated man going from the ""Lord of Ten Thousand Years"" to ""Prisoner #981,"" but for all the time the film took, I'm not sure I really got at the truth of him, or if he should be sympathized with.It's easy to see why the film was so popular in 1987. Just to see the Forbidden City at this time, with all of the attention to ornate details, created visual appeal, and the aura of an epic.

We see him unknowingly abdicate his throne as a boy, held virtual prisoner among the greatest opulence as a teenager, then seduced by the warlike Japanese as a young man, who return him to the throne as a puppet over Manchuria, which they've conquered. This narrative is intercut with his imprisonment and ""re-education"" as a war criminal during the time of Mao-Tse Tung.

Impressive But Unbalanced,"'The Last Emperor' is a mutli-genre film that combines historical drama, political storytelling, visual sensuality and prison narrative, all parts of the fragmented life of Pu Yi, last emperor of the now eclipsed Ching dynasty. The marriage of Bernardo Bertolucci's persistent direction and Vittorio Storaro's lyrical cinematography produce a spectacular visual context, created exclusively on-location. With reverence and respect, the two Italian masters offer Western audiences precious glimpses of life and culture in one of the world's most complex civilizations. The didactic theme of the film is equally precious, delivered through the life of an 'emperor of nothing', whose elevated social position causes his life to be meaningless and interned. Paradoxically, his prison reeducation under the communist regime frees him physically and mentally by rendering him, for the first time of his life, master of his own actions. Sadly, the film's visual and moralizing components appear to exhaust the film's usefulness. The script tends to spiral around itself producing several meaningless segments, and one gets the impression that, more often than not, Bertolucci treats his actors as rudimentary, consuming himself with visual delivery and theoretical extrapolations to the expense of character development. Ultimately, more equilibrium between the film's elements would probably have achieved a higher degree of purpose, whose absence undermines this fine production in more ways than one.",6.0,Anonymous,History

J.' Johnston and he was simply outstanding.Finally I believe that ""The Last Emperor"" is a must see movie and everybody have to watch this movie, it's a really life lesson.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A good biographical film.,"This film tells the life of the last Chinese emperor, Pu Yi. Crowned as a baby, he lived a life of limitless luxury but was eventually expelled from his throne by the revolution of 1911. Imprisoned in his palace like a bird in a golden cage, he saw the decay of his country and the dramatic changes of Republican China from the inside of the Forbidden City. Expelled by the Communists years later, he spent a good part of his life trying to regain his throne, and the rest of it imprisoned in Chinese reeducation camps that transformed him into an ordinary man. There is undoubtedly a poetic beauty in the transformation of the main character, and the film can make us feel the changes in his personality, as well as the changes of his former empire. The film suggests several things about him and the imperial family that I do not know if they are truth, like the apparent lesbianism of one of the emperor's wives and their use of drugs. Bernardo Bertolucci is a director that I normally do not appreciate, but I recognize in this film many qualities. The actors did a very regular and interesting performance. John Lone was perfect in the role of the emperor, but even brighter was Peter O'Toole, in a role that, otherwise, with another actor, could be overly subdued. The film's set-ups are glamorous and go a long way toward creating a Hollywood-era epic movie feel. Nevertheless, the comparison of this film as ""Seven Years in Tibet"", by context, time and closeness, is more pertinent than with any other film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Vastly Overrated!!!,"I have to say I was severely disappointed in watching ""The Last Emperor"" last night. Having never seen it before, but always being aware that it was a well-reviewed and critically acclaimed film led me to believe like most films that fit into his category, it too would be enjoyable even though it took me years to get around to viewing it.All I can say it that I really do NOT understand the High rating or how this film won 9 Academy Awards!! Whilst I can see that the subject matter was quite interesting and had Great potential to be a very very interesting film and highly entertaining, I found it to be slow paced,lacking in detail of the many occurrences/conflict points in the film, and general overall lack of making you care about the characters in the film.I can see that the film should have been great, and certainly had the potential to be great based on an extremely interesting subject matter, but I just felt like the lack of true emotional connection to the characters or their situations (due to poor explanation on the film's part in my opinion) make it impossible to enjoy this film the way I should have or would have liked to.I can see on paper that the sheer scope of this film warrants some attention and praise, but I thought the execution in practice was very very poor and the film uninteresting.I really do not understand the high praise this film receives (other than it being the ""epic"" type of film Hollywood like to praise from time to time), as I thought it was poorly acted (other than the younger children), poorly conceived, and lacked any real emotion from what should have been a powerful powerful film.Just my take on what I was hoping would be the epic film I had heard so much about.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Hall of Preserving Harmony,"I saw this because I saw another Chinese film the other day, quasi- historical and lush, and wanted to see what a European would bring.You can see what attracted Bertollucci to this project. Here's a film about an emperor, ruler of a quarter of the world in his time, who died a common gardener. It offers unlimited possibilities for visual splendour, of course—the Forbidden City above all, closed off for centuries but here open to our gaze. And it is a history of millions, it seems in the West we can't comprehend China unless it has swathes of conflict.The main narrative device is so good, it boggles the mind that more wasn't accomplished—not just history but a chronicle recalled from many pairs of eyes as our film, Citizen Kane- style. A deathdream, a memory triggered by a newsreel, a contrasting testimony perhaps offered to please. A fancy Scottsman's memoirs, perhaps embellished? Perhaps read by the prison warden to confirm preconceived guilt?A confession before a tribunal, but one we could trust in any way?A truly imaginative mind would've done so much more with the triggers and stirring of untrusted narration. He would've done more with the second consort's disappearance and simultaneous appearance of the spy woman, introducing opium and deluded ego. More, in general, with the shifts inside the memory from gilded childhood where sight begins to dim to the self-delusion of power to loss and humility. To its credit, it's more interesting than I thought it would be after the first hour.But as in Kundun we get for the most part an operatic sort of beauty. Oh there are a few unforgettable images in there, most to do with fabrics and colors. But the eye of the camera is much like the emperor, a dull observer of fancy things. There's no real difference between different voices telling the story, the many concealed desires and quashed dreams that may be pushing through the fabrics, conscious or not, changing what we see as we see it. There's just so much to play with here, it's a shame we end up with merely preserved harmony. But that's also how the Chinese would have it.I can only imagine what transcendent dragons of self Malick and his floating eye would have seen in the flowing silks.",,Anonymous,History
Good but sometimes confusing,"I really enjoyed this film.  It was beautiful and insightful and I left with an overwhelming sense of awe.  However, not having known much about early 20th century Chinese history, there were several times when I would get totally and completely lost.  I think it would have been a much more enjoyable film if I didn't have to spend so much of my time trying to figure out what just happened.  Just a little explanation could go a long way (or even a brief title display).Of course, those comment apply to the shorter version of the film.  After browsing IMDB I find that there is a directors cut that is longer.  I would like to see that version instead of the short one.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best Epics ever made,"This film is sort of underrated toward other epics like (Lawrence of Arabia, Schindler's List, and Ben-Hur). The Last Emperor is probably gives one of the last greatest epics without a high standing hero within the movie. It shows the vision of an early pre-Communistic China to the after matters of World War II. The film has as high quality as any film of today, maybe even better. The acting is superb through the whole film, and the directing is excellent. This probably one of Bernardo Bertolucci`s best films (Last Tango in Paris and The Conformist). It just sweep the 1987 Academy Awards by winning nine Oscars.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"This film was the Best Picture Winner at the 60th Oscars on April 11th, 1988","You simply could not escape hearing about how great this movie was back in the late 1980s. This biopic, is a film about Henry Pu Yi, the last emperor of China. What is great about most historical films is they always tackle certain ""lost"" parts about history. The bridge in a remote part of Burma, in The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957), the tiny sailboat used by the American army in the film, the Wackiest Ship in the Army (1960) and this film, which also has that ""lost"" feel to it. Not many of us would think, that even a huge empire like China, would have a last emperor. It makes the audience wonder, even the thought of the idea seems interesting.That is what director, Bernardo Bertolucci, gives to you in this film. He establishes that interest in the idea of a last emperor. The film opens up in 1950 when Henry's life, as he knew it, is already over. His glory days have gone by and he is now a captive in the more modern version of the People's Republic of China. A political prisoner, who once was an emperor of Manchuria China. The audience is then transported back to 1906, as the new emperor of Manchuria, who right now, is barely out of diapers, begins his journey through the decades.Bertolucci created a film, that may have been ahead of its time. You don't even have to mention the Oscar wins, the great critical response or even the commercial success of this movie. What really makes this film good is the two linear time-lines that Bertolucci drives the film with. He takes the 1950s part of the story, continues it along, by weaving it into the other timeline, that started in 1906 and flips, back and forth, between each, in a highly informative description of this man's life. It is a plot device seen more today, in the 21st century, than the 1980s really.Henry Pu Yi is played by a gifted actor, who some people may not know well, but he has quietly put together an amazing acting resume over the last 50 years. I knew of John Lone from his work in the Year of the Dragon (1985), the Michael Cimino-Mickey Rourke film about the Chinatown crime organizations. I also remember him popping up as the triad bad guy in Rush Hour 2 (2001). What I was really shocked about, is a movie I have been watching, every 5-10 years, since it was released in 1984, starred this guy in the title role. It was the role that put him over the top and into Henry Pu Yi's lap. I never put ""2 & 2"" together until I wrote this review. John Lone was the caveman in the critically acclaimed film, Iceman (1984). That blew my mind. If you appreciate his work in that film, you will love his work in this film too.7.5 (C+ MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Life of a Puppet,"""The Last Emperor"" is an example of what might be called the ""epic biopic"", a filmed biography made on the grand scale. Other examples of this genre are David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and Richard Attenborough's ""Gandhi"", but there is an important difference between Bertolucci's film and either of those examples. T.E. Lawrence and Mahatma Gandhi were historically important figures who, in their different ways, both played important active roles in the history of the twentieth century. Bertolucci's subject, the Chinese Emperor Pu Yi was, despite his elevated birth, an entirely passive figure. (It is perhaps incorrect to call him the ""last Emperor"" as the title was briefly revived for a few months in 1915-16 under General Yuan Shih-Kai). The word most commonly applied to him, in connection with his controversial role as figurehead of the Japanese-sponsored state of Manchukuo between 1931 and 1945, was ""puppet"", but Bertolucci shows that he was a puppet for virtually the whole of his life. First he was the puppet of the Court officials who proclaimed him Emperor as a young child, then after the revolution of 1911 of the warlord-dominated Republican government which for its own political reasons allowed him to continue to live in the Forbidden City in Peking, maintaining a Court and the style of a monarch, then of the Japanese and finally of the Communist regime which sought to make propaganda out of his supposed transformation into a model citizen.Pu Yi was not only a puppet, he was also for most of his life a prisoner, either in the literal or the metaphorical sense. He was literally imprisoned between 1945 and 1950, first by the Soviets and then by the Chinese Communists, but at all times his freedom was restricted by those controlling him. One of the most memorable scenes in the film comes when the young Pu Yi attempts to leave the Forbidden City to attend his mother's funeral but is prevented from doing so by palace guards who slam the gates shut. A deliberately similar scene occurs later in the film when he, now ruler of Manchukuo, is prevented from leaving his palace to visit his wife in hospital by his Japanese handlers.Despite Bertolucci's own Marxist sympathies and the fact that the film was dependent on the goodwill of the Chinese authorities, it does not really try for a consistent political interpretation of Chinese history, but concentrates very much on the character of Pu Yi himself. While in prison, Pu Yi complains to the prison governor that he is only being kept alive because he is useful to the Communists. The governor, presented as a relatively decent man despite the totalitarian nature of the regime he serves, replies ""Is that such a terrible thing, to be useful?"" This is meant as a kindly rebuke, but it begs the questions ""useful to whom?"" and ""useful for what purpose?"" Certainly, to have served the interests of two brutal regimes, the Japanese militarists and Mao's Communists, is nothing to be proud of, but at least Pu Yi's talent for making himself useful meant that he managed to survive (when many did not) during some of the most turbulent epochs of China's history.The film is not told as a straightforward linear narrative; it starts with Pu Yi being handed over by his Soviet captors to their Chinese allies in 1950, and continues by inter-cutting scenes set in prison with flashbacks telling the story of his previous life. This technique enables Bertolucci to contrast the austerity of Pu Yi's captivity (although I would agree with the previous reviewer who pointed out that life in a Maoist labour camp would in all probability have been much harsher than shown here) with the magnificent, if empty, splendour of life in the Manchu court and his decadent, luxurious life after his expulsion from the Forbidden City.The film won a number of Oscars, including the awards for ""Best Picture"" and ""Best Director"". I am not sure that it was the best film of 1987 (my personal preference would have been for John Boorman's ""Hope and Glory""), but it is nevertheless an excellent one. What surprised me was that it did not receive a single Oscar nomination in the acting categories, although in my view it could have had three or four, Best Actor for John Lone as Pu Yi himself, Best Actress for Joan Chen as his tragic, drug-addicted Empress Wan Jung, and Best Supporting Actor for Peter O'Toole as Pu Yi's Scottish tutor Reginald Johnstone (and possibly also for Ying Ruocheng as the prison governor). Around the time this film was released, the lovely Joan Chen was widely tipped to become a major Hollywood star; that she has never really done so might suggest that leading roles for Oriental actresses are as hard to come by as they were in the days of Anna May Wong.If I have a criticism of the film, it was that it did not explain things enough and expected its audience to have a wide knowledge of Chinese history. My comments are based upon the 160 minute version; I have not seen the 219 minute director's cut, although I would be very interested to do so. A running-time in excess of 3½ hours might well be justified if one's subject is the history in the twentieth century of the world's most populous nation. Bertolucci has made some horribly boring films, such as ""Last Tango in Paris"" and ""The Sheltering Sky"", but ""The Last Emperor"" is a fascinating one. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
A grand and proper film,"The Last Emperor was a major milestone in Chinese cinema, it was the first Western film allowed to be made since the form of the Communist government in 1949 and it was also the first feature film allowed to be filmed in the Forbidden City. The Last Emperor is a grand story, from 1908 to mid 60s about the last emperor of China.Told in flashbacks Puyi (John Lone) is a prisoner of the People's Republic of China, he is charged for be a collaborator with the Japanese in Manchuria. As a child Puyi was crowned the emperor of China at the age of three. The film explores his youth in the Forbidden City, where he is pretty much a prisoner who is not allow to be outside in the real world or be with children, to being a brat who can do whatever he wants but with no understanding of the political situation outside his walls, to a smarter young man who wants to reform his court and being tutored by Reginald Johnston (Peter O'Toole). After being removed as the emperor of China he ends up becoming the puppet of emperor of Manchukuo for the Japanese, with his relationship declining as he desires some sort of power.The Last Emperor is very much like a David Lean film, shot in a similar style, matching his scope on a grand scale and tackling a story he would have handled. The Last Emperor's setting in a Chinese prison was very much like the framing device was very much like the one used in Doctor Zhivago. Visually Bernardo Bertolucci and his cinematographer Vittorio Storaro do make a great looking moving, with large colourful scenes in the Forbidden City to the grab greyness of a Communist Prison. Bertolucci shows a really interesting culture within the Chinese court and there are big ideas about how isolation and a boy being told that he is going to rule and do what ever he wants can really mess up someone's childhood. As a child Puyi was a brat but there is sadness and lonely because he can not be with children, nor be with his mother, resulting with him relying on a wet nurse at an old age. There are also ideas of a child who is meant to be a ruler but obviously has no understanding of the political situation, because of his age and his councillors lie to him. As he gets older he is more politically enlightened and want to be a reformer, but again there are ideas that he still wanted to be a ruler, therefore he ended up in leagues with the Japanese. Bertolucci uses some clever imagery, such as hearing a protest outside the walls of the Forbidden City when the troops start to fire at them, showing both Puyi isolation and powerlessness, as well as the political turmoil that China was suffering. and the coronation of Puyi as emperor of Manchukuo is at a windy, empty mound, a symbol that Puyi was hollow figure for the Japanese: but he was wanting to rule for the good of his people. Another powerful image is when Puyi tries to cycle out of the Forbidden City, seeing Beijing/Peking and the guards shut the gates in front of him. To add to the atmosphere Bertolucci with his composers also employ an excellent Chinese sounding score throughout the film.There is an excellent cast, giving performances like in a Lean film. Lone was excellent as the Emperor and though it was a weird casting an English man to play a Scot (and not even bother doing an accent), O'Toole was very strong. Ying Ruocheng too gave a good performance as the prison governor and even though it was a very small role, I loved Ric Young as a harsh interrogator. The child actor were very good and confidence in their performances, with Richard Vuu being very sweet as the 3-year-old version of Puyu. Joan Chen was assured (and lovely looking) as Wan Jung, starting out a nice young woman who likes Puyu for being an intelligence young man but slowly destroys herself with opium. I personally would have preferred to have seen the film in Chinese languages but because it was in English the film can appeal to a wider audience: plus my favourite film is Schindler's List which in theory should have been made in German, so I can't really complain.To anyone who is interested in history or Chinese culture then The Last Emperor is a must see for you. It is also an excellent film if you like Lean films like Doctor Zhivago, Lawerence of Arabia and The Bridge over the River Kwai and the Spielberg film Empire of the Sun.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Storm Swirled Around Him,"After many years, I viewed this film for a second time, and I must state from the start that I was not as dazzled by the spectacle of the production as I was the first time, especially during the second half, which I found rather dull.On this second viewing, I realized that this extravaganza, nearly three hours in duration, was more significant as a history of China during the twentieth century than as the story of its last emperor, Pu Yi. Although I am not a student of Chinese history, as far as I could determine from the movie, Pu Yi didn't accomplish very much as emperor since the time when he was crowned in 1908 at the age of three. Much of his younger years were spent in isolation in the Forbidden City after he had already abdicated the throne. From Beijing, he spent a time living the high life of a playboy in Tientsin before becoming a puppet of the Japanese conquerors in Machukuo, which was also Pu Yi's original homeland of Manchuria. Once the Japanese were defeated at the end of World War II, Pu Yi was imprisoned by the communist Chinese until his ""liberation"" in 1959. He lived another eight years as an employee of the Botanical Gardeners of Beijing.The first half of the film was fascinating as a cinematic marvel, including its artistic photography, majestic settings, and astounding number of extras which numbered 19,000. Somehow, this visual feast faded for me during the second half. I realized somewhere along the way that I was not emotionally invested in most of the main characters and was forced to consult the detailed plot on this website in order to confirm the story elements, which were not always clear to me and sometimes confusing.Winning nine Oscars may impress some, but the awards by themselves do not define a great film. Great films stand on their own, regardless of how the film industry and establishment views them. I am not stating that the film did not deserve at least some of its recognition, but 1988 did not seem to provide much competition. Just as an example, none of the films nominated for best picture in that year obtained a combined rating higher than an ""8"" by IMDb subscribers.For its eye-catching, colorful depiction of twentieth century Chinese history alone, especially during the first half, the film is definitely worth seeing, but I wouldn't call it ""magnificent"", as many have. The life of Pu Yi was captivating only in the context of the tumultuous events that surrounded him.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Very Interesting Subject Matter,"""The Last Emperor"" takes us through the waning years of Qing China, its decades as a struggling republic, the Japanese occupation of Manchuria during World War II, and the dawn of Red China; all through the eyes of its final emperor, Puyi (John Lone).I loved the sets and the use of extras and the costume design. It gives the movie a very regal feel and contrasts well with the prison scenes set in the 1950s where the communists wear drab gray clothing.It goes really in-depth on a lot of twentieth century Chinese history, which will admittedly be a little hard to follow for those who don't have at least a rough idea of when certain events took place and who the main players were. John Lone gives an excellent performance as Puyi, who's often portrayed as out of his element and who plays a naïve puppet role his entire life. It kind of makes me feel sorry for the guy as he was never really given the freedom to live the life that he wanted, was always kept somewhat in the dark by conniving eunuchs and advisors, and had a lot of the blame of Japanese war crimes placed on him despite his ignorance of it. That being said, he did have a huge ego and wanted so desperately to stay with the traditional ways that he never took the time to notice that the world around him was changing and that a lot of people, including his citizens and his wives (Joan Chen and Vivian Wu) suffered a lot because of his attitude.A great biographical film that sheds some light on East Asian history, which I feel is a neglected subject that ought to have more representation.

almost too remote at times,"Bernardo Bertolucci's epic biography of Mainland China's final hereditary monarch shows a man adrift in time, born into a century which saw a hundred generations of history and tradition become anachronisms. Crowned at age three the Sun of Heaven and Lord of a Thousand Years, the emperor Pu Yi would serve as little more than a symbolic figurehead throughout his life, with no real power beyond the walls of the Forbidden City.The scenario has all the elements for a compelling history lesson, and the scale of the film is hard to resist: Bertolucci and co-writer Mark Peploe trace the emperor's life from opulent cradle to inglorious grave (he died a humble gardener in post-Revolution Peking), setting their story against a turbulent and colorful background of modern Chinese politics. The panoramic photography is like a window opening onto another world, filling the screen with rare and exotic sights. But at times the spectacle almost overwhelms the lonely figure at the center of all the pageantry: the emperor himself, a prisoner on his own throne, and as much a mystery at the end of the film as he was when it began.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Endlessly Interesting,The Last Emperor is a visually stunning and thematically interesting film. Bertolucci does a fine job directing this truly epic tale of the last emperor of China. As a lover of history I actually already knew much more of the story than the film depicts. I feel that it's one weakness was its lack of clarity it informing the viewer to the machinations and forces that are actually driving the action unfolding. I think that is a critical element that could have been improved. Despite this shortcoming I found the film to be very fascinating and entertaining and one that is definitely worth checking out.,9.0,Anonymous,History
Another overlong Oscar baiting historical drama with plenty of neat touches,"The Last Emperor is a best picture winner. We all know what this means. It's too long, it's about something deep and meaningful, it's light on the watchability, it's pretentious and it's probably not actually the best movie of that year. And TLE ticks most of the boxes in the best picture rulebook and it's impossible for something like this not to be critically acclaimed and awarded with Oscars. With the butt numbing run time and poor pacing which means the film half heartedly goes in and out of fascinating content I think we can all say safely 9 Oscars was a bit excessive. However, this is a good historical epic. The visuals could have come right out of an art gallery and many beautiful images are created without there being a pixel of CGI in sight. The acting is all around pretty good, and you can tell the director Bernardo Bertolucci really knows what he's doing and has plenty of experience in the film business.TLE works thanks to its sobering and moving story which has some interesting themes to do with power and yearning for power. It's fairly powerful on an emotional level and by the end one does feel genuinely moved. It's got plenty of boring moments but plenty of interesting ones as well and it feels authentic and recreates the period well. It doesn't come across as manipulative or overly sentimental and you get the impression it is telling the story accurately without artistic deviations from fact. It does meander, but it has to be admired for the powerful storytelling and amazing visuals. It's not the most enjoyable film ever but it is a very interesting one and you still enjoy it a fair amount. Overall, this is a stirring and interesting historical epic which is rather entertaining and thought provoking, although they could have made it a bit faster. Still, that's Oscar winners for you.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,History

A masterpiece,"This is one of the best epic all the time. A brilliant costume and cinematographic technique. It's about last emperor of China Pu Yi who is always live in a horrifying spiritual durance.I heard of this motion picture many years ago. About ten years or more ago, Joan Chen was a widely known star in China for this picture. Almost every Chinese know it. However, I never saw it before last afternoon. The reason is I'm afraid of I'm too young to get the point of the thick history. So I saw it when I'm sure I have been up to understand history enough.BTW, ""10,000 years"" never means ""he was the king of 10,000 years"", that's a wish. All people wish their emperor could live forever, even 10,000 years(the brothers of the emperor called 1,000 years). Everyone must say it when he or she meet the emperor. That's the rule of each dynastic royalty never change till QING dynasty vanished away. I seem to pity Pu Yi throughout I experience the picture. He was an emperor without any power and enough space. The most unfortunate is he never escape from an invisible cage. At first, he was imprisoned by warlord in Forbidden City and then by Japan military till been a criminal of betrayed motherland. He wants to be a true emperor, he never been released by his soul and ambition, eventually makes him as betrayer and totally puppet. What a tragic character!

from old China to modern China,"Bernardo Bertolucci's sweeping epic ""The Last Emperor"" is mostly a look at the life of Puyi, whose reign witnessed massive political changes in China. Like Steven Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"", released around the same time, the movie helps one understand why modern China is like it is. The story gets told as a flashback, with the imprisoned Puyi remembering the different stages of his life. The Communists charge him with collaborating with the Japanese occupation of Manchuria, but this new government has become just as bad. There has been no change in China's politics from the imperial era to the republican era to the communist era. As emperor, Puyi was confined to the Forbidden City, and now he suffers a new kind of confinement.Bertolucci makes use of colors the same way that Stanley Kubrick did, adding up to a most impressive movie. It won nine well deserved Academy Awards including Best Picture. John Lone puts all his effort into the role of Puyi, and has fine support from Joan Chen, Peter O'Toole, Victor Wong and others. It's over two and a half hours, but it's worth the effort so that you can understand how the world's most populous country ended up like it is today.

One of the Best Historical Dramas Ever Made,"I think of this movie a lot, even though I saw it in 1987. That is the mark of a great film. At the end when an aged Pu-Yi visits the Imperial Palace and remembers his days as Emperor is so powerful. His character develops so much during the course of the movie.The acting is incredible.

Elegant Travel Brochure,"This movie is a let down. Vincent Canby's review in NYT sums it up elegantly.""The Last Emperor"" is like an elegant travel brochure. It piques the curiosity. One wants to go.The movie is based on bare facts of a quite extraordinary life lived by someone who seems to have been a most commonplace person. Pu Yi was an accident of meteorology, the calm, rather empty center of the political hurricane that was blowing around him and that defined his place in history. Pu Yi was a cipher compared to the remarkable characters who, in one way or another, shaped his life and modern China.The director was given access to some magnificent locations within the Forbidden City as well as elsewhere in China and Manchuria. The eye is frequently entertained, while the center of the screen remains dead. Mr. O'Toole rattles off his lines with speed and what often seems to be a comic disregard for what they mean. From time to time, when he must register a certain ineffable sadness, he enunciates each word as if it were a pearl, which it isn't. This is not a great performance. Somewhat better are Mr. Lone, Miss Chen, Miss Lu and Richard Vuu, who plays Pu Yi as a 3-year-old and looks angelic.Ultimately, it's a let-down.",5.0,Anonymous,History
the loneliness of the film was too heavy,"The first impression after I watched the film was loneliness. Pu Yi was the last emperor in a turbulent era in China, his whole life was lived in a world without choices and freedom. He wanted love, friendships or family relationships, but none of them stayed with him. The emperor wanted to take control of his future, even just one small thing, unfortunately he did not have freedom to choose his marriage, or go out of the forbidden city. His existence was only used to achieve other people's greed, such as eunuchs and the Japanese.His miserable lifetime was saying farewell to everyone close to him. He cannot meet his mother since he was an infant; his beloved wife left him in an unexpected way; his English teacher went back to the United Kingdom unwillingly because of the war. I could feel the powerlessness of Pu Yi. Although he was served by thousands of people, he was still unhappy and lonely, I could see through his desperate eyes. His life turned into a story after he died, over a thousand of million came to visit the forbidden city, but no one really understands the suffering of his experience.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Last Emperor - A Good Study in Modern China,"The Last Emperor is a wonderful production by a master director, Bernardo Bertalucci, who knows how to use the camera, and get the most out of his actors. Veteran actor Peter O'Toole adds to the quality of the cast. John Lone and Joan Chen add to the talented cast. The film traces the life of the little boy emperor, Pu-Yi, who eventually became the last emperor of China during the Qing Dynasty.We trace Pu-Yi's unfortunate adventures through events he has absolutely no control over; the fall of the Qing, the establishment of the KMT, The Japanese Occupation, the rise of the CCP, the Chinese Civil War between the KMT and CCP. And the consequences he faces after the victory of the CCP over the KMT. It also traces his experiences as a grown man during the Cultural Revolution under Mao Zedong, a very unpleasant period of Chinese history that resulted in more Chinese deaths than Russia had under Stalin. A film that will teach you much about China.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"When ""Son of Heaven"" experienced personal and political twilight...","Bernardo Bertolucci... Wherever I ask anyone about this man, there is usually one answer that appears: the director of THE LAST EMPEROR (1987). This film, made almost twenty years ago, is still so popular that every day there is a place in the world where it is watched. One may ask ""what is so special about it that a film about the last emperor of China became one of the undeniable cult movies?"" The answer, I think, lies primarily in Bertolucci, the director and some of the movie's powerful aspects.THE LAST EMPEROR which, on the one hand, deals with quite a difficult content being a sort of ""vague movie"" filled with flashbacks and flash-forwards, is, on the other hand, a real tribute to what Bertolucci tries to convey in cinema: colors and fascism. The overdose of colors may seem an exaggeration for some viewers while fascism appears to be a wonderful insight into characters' emotional states. The movie, particularly the sequence filmed in the Forbidden City, is full of breathtakingly stunning picture of the declining imperial power of China. This makes THE LAST EMPEROR an impressive epic proportion film and the cinematography by Vittorio Storaro one of the finest found in films. Pu Yi (John Lone), the last emperor, spends his youth years in the Forbidden City where he theoretically rules, but actually plays ruling since his country is no longer the empire it used to be but a communist People's Republic of China. These scenes (actually flashbacks since the film's action starts in 1950 when Pu Yi is already a prisoner) are splendid. Let me mention, for instance, the throne of the Empress widow, Pu Yi's wedding, a sensual love scene between Pu Yi and his two women - the Forbidden City sequence is pure Bertolucci with magnificent entertainment. The rest is a contrasted moody picture and a realistic image of the cruel reality that the main character experiences after the downfall of his power. Therefore, it is a different entertainment filled with director's political evaluations.CAST: The performers consist primarily of Chinese cast, some not famous internationally. Nevertheless, they are all worth attention and the performances in this movie are unquestionably good. John Lone is very appealing as the Son of Heaven, the Lord of ten thousand years, Pu Yi. He perfectly expresses the emotional states of his character, gives a balanced performance of an aging man and of someone whose fate is exceptionally brute. By his developed performance, he leads a viewer to his character's psyche and creates a unique insight into his emotions. Joan Chen is marvelous as the empress Wan Jung - a beautiful woman and a very talented Chinese actress. I think that her most unforgettable moment is the wedding night and her first kissing the young emperor. But the performance that is outstanding in the movie is the one by Peter O'Toole. Since he is the only ""British looking"" actor in the film, he does a perfect job among so different cast. His role of Reginald Johnston, the emperor's tutor, a Scotsman, is entirely worth consideration. O'Toole is a great actor, one of the very best of all time and whenever I see his name in the credits, I am certain that he will not disappoint me with anything. And that is true, without any doubt, when applied to THE LAST EMPEROR as well.CONTENT: The entire story may seem sad: the last emperor of China who was considered the Lord of ten thousand years, ends up as a peasant citizen of the People's Republic of China experiencing communist cruelty and even the Mao cult with its Cultural Revolution of the 1960s. Yet, the action is constructed in such a way that a viewer's interest is wonderfully kept. I loved the aforementioned flashbacks and flash-forwards since this created a feeling of timeless facts. Not chronology makes the utmost importance but life treated as an integral part of a human. When we live, we escape to our memories very often and that that is the thing which constitutes our dreams and evaluations. Moreover, by showing Pu Yi's life in this way, Bertolucci went deeper into his emotional states and filled the film with associations and inner struggles. I loved the moments of ""Open the door!"" - how beautifully symbolic and how accurately emotional!CULTURAL REFERENCE: There is one more factor that makes this film interesting: the insight to the Chinese culture. I have never seen a movie that presents an exotic culture (exotic to me as a Pole) in such a balanced and interesting way. Among many moments that show the marvelous culture of the Far East, I loved the moment when three year-old Pu Yi appears at the imperial palace. A widowed empress is set on her throne under the black pearl and tells little boy about his future and the dead emperor who is riding dragons in heaven. Little Pu Yi's face is filled with wonderful curiosity of a child. This moment remained in my memory as particularly unforgettable.THE LAST EMPEROR is a good film. I do not consider it a masterpiece as some other people do, but I find it a highly accurate movie that is absolutely worth a look. Perhaps, you will not agree with me that the performances are that great since you may have different expectations concerning this aspect; perhaps, you will not like the Chinese story since the history of this country does not constitute your primary interests. However, you will love the number of moments filmed in the Forbidden City...I promise you that!",8.0,Anonymous,History
"An Overwhelmingly Glum Survey of Imperial China's Lingering, Ceremonial Afterlife","A long, delicate meditation on the necessity of a ceremonial public role in the face of several looming, massive, cultural revolutions. It's also an essay on the corrupting power of an absurdly sheltered life. Following the private and public trials of Puyi, who ascended to the imperial throne before his fourth birthday, it's one soul-crunching onslaught of manipulation after another over the course of several decades. Almost every single member of the cast is either disgustingly entitled or a steadfast, unwavering fanatic to a self-serving cause, including the emperor himself who often falls into both camps. He's naive and misguided, a result of his isolated regal upbringing, but also wants desperately to make a lasting positive mark on the world. It's frustrating to watch his attempts at reform explode on the launchpad over and over again due to the oppressive presence of a corrupt group of advisors, a hamstring he's never able to overcome. Though it has a tendency to linger far too long, the film is drop-dead gorgeous when it's set inside China's famous forbidden city. When later chapters shift to other locations, it drains that life from the screen and the already-dreary story really starts to drag. A real downer, it can be powerful at times but suffers from a total lack of resolution.",5.0,Anonymous,History
the last time I'll watch the last emperor,"I saw the Last Emperor when it first came out in 87. I recall being incredibly bored then so I gave it another go on DVD. In the first ten minutes its obvious why it won all those Oscars. Loads of great photography, masterful attention to period detail, fluid camera movement editing etc. Then scene after scene after scene of bowing crowds, massive palatial spreads, kow towing serfs, pomp and circumstance, and flat out dullness. The characters never come to life. Scenes are left undeveloped. The movie suffers from something a lot of movies post 80's are infected with. There is such a great need to move the plot forward to get the narrative progressing that characterization and scene development suffer. This results in the viewer (me) not giving a rat's a$% what happens to anyone in the film. Lawrence of Arabia it isn't. Even the appearance of Peter O' Toole is no help as he plays a stiff upper class British tutor in a film that is already filled with so much stiffness it is in desperate need of his Year of Living Dangerously character to liven things up. The film doesn't liven up and 24 years after first seeing it , this will be my last viewing of the Last Emperor.",,Anonymous,History

A biopic about a passive hero,"There is no denying that ""The last emperor"" is a great epic movie. A movie on an equal grand scale as the epics of David Lean, but with a greater historical accuracy than for example ""Dr Zhivago"" (1965, David Lean) (which is not that strange because ""The last emperor"" is based on an autobiography and ""Dr Zhivago"" on a fiction novel).Add to this that ""The last emperor"" was shot (as first film ever) on location in the Forbidden city and it is no wonder that the film accumulated an astounding number of 9 Oscars under which the categories of best film, best director and best cinematography.Comparing the film with the rest of the oeuvre of director Bernardo Bertolucci ""Novecento"" (1976) immediatly comes to mind. This film also spans a time period of decades including the Second World War. Contrary to ""The last emperor"" the film is however situated in Europe.A second film that comes to (my) mind is ""To live"" (1994, Zhang Yimou). Also a film spanning decades and combining the history of a family with the history of a country. A film also situated in China but with a different director.In ""To live"" the history of a country is combined with the history of a lower class fictional family. In ""The last emperor"" the history of China is combined with the history of a non fictional higher class emperor.A biopic is mostly made about a person who has changed history. The remarkable thing about ""The last emperor"" is that main character Pu Yi effectively has as less influence on Chinese history as the poor family from ""To live"".When he became emperor Pu Yi was less than 3 years old and 4 years later China became a republic after which the emperor ruled only within the Forbidden city. Even the term ""ruling"" is somewhat out of place. The emperor may not leave the forbidden city and this custom is enforced by his own guard, even against his will.It is no wonder that when the emperor is thrown out of the Forbidden city in 1924 he is totally out of touch with reality. Therefore it is easy for the Japanese to abuse him as their marionet ""ruling"" the puppet state of Manchuko in the Second World War.When the Communist came to power they quite understandably regard Pu Yi as a war criminal and send him to a re-education camp. The term re-education has an ominous sound, associated as it is with dictatorships of the worst kind. The re-education of Pu Yi is probably one of the scarce examples of successful re-education. He becomes a gardener and experiences probably the happiest years of his life.The film ends with a beautiful scene in which Pu Yi visits the Forbidden city as a tourist.The Forbidden city, a colossal complex with 9.999 rooms (only heaven has 10.000 rooms), has the potential of dwarving the human characters. It is the merit of cinematographer Vittorio Storaro that this does not happen.In a couple of scenes there is a window with a bright blue / turquoise light shining trough it in the background. I did see a similar background in some (key) scenes of ""Eyes wide shut"" (1999, Stanley Kubrick).",8.0,Anonymous,History
An Epic But It Doesn't Resonate,"The Last Emperor is the type of film that seeks to impose more than engage. With extravagant sets and a self indulgent luxuriousness covering a man's life that sprawls out for nearly three hours. However, the gratuitous production values can hardly be more than tepidly received. It's a lot of noise and color but without much meaning. The plot improves a bit when the titular emperor leaves the Forbidden City and the movie chronicles his experiences during WW2 but most of the political drama is hardly worth the attention it demands. The only part of the story which does resonate is the overarching grand picture. Of a lonely boy who went from being the emperor to a common poor citizen. The Last Emperor is a good story but it's not a cinematic one. And the film is essentially like a history book played out on screen.",5.0,Anonymous,History

'The Americans believe everyone is born good. You must be judged.',"Bernardo Bertolucci's 1987 extravaganza THE LAST EMPEROR is rich in spectacle, costumes, cinematography, massive crowd scenes, and history, and yet for all its grandeur some of the most touching moments are form the language of eyes, simple words of a child, and especially worlds form the teacher RJ Johnston - 'The Emperor has been a prisoner in his own palace since the day that he was crowned, and has remained a prisoner since he abdicated. But now he's growing up, he may wonder why he's the only person in China who may not walk out of his own front door. I think the Emperor is the loneliest boy on Earth.' And 'Words are important. Pu Yi, at 15: Why are words important? RJ Johnson ""If you cannot say what you mean, your majesty, you will never mean what you say and a gentleman should always mean what he says.'Re-visiting THE LAST EMPEROR 30 years after the film was made is a refreshing experience. Yes, the costumes are grand, the mass scenes are impressive, the music (the Chinese music - not the indulgent American music of the period) is special, the cast is solid, but the impressive aspect of the film is the opportunity to re-visit history in this manner. Especially, today when we are constantly reminded of China's influence in global affairs, it is interesting to recap how that country went from being ruled by a child emperor to the influx of Japan and the wars and the destruction of many of the most beautiful antiquities of China, and became the Republic of China.John Lone is especially well suited as Pu-Yi as an adult as is Peter O'Toole as his teacher RJ Johnson. As one observer noted, 'This sweeping account of the life of Pu-Yi, the last emperor of China, follows the leader's tumultuous reign. After being captured by the Red Army as a war criminal in 1950, Pu-Yi recalls his childhood from prison. He remembers his lavish youth in the Forbidden City, where he was afforded every luxury but unfortunately sheltered from the outside world and complex political situation surrounding him. As revolution sweeps through China, the world Pu-Yi knew is dramatically upended.'This is a film to visit again and again - for so many reasons.",10.0,Anonymous,History
There's nothing you get from this picture that you don't get looking at the video box.,"A fascinating central situation: a six year old is told they're almighty ruler of a thousand years (so the kid eventually figures out he can do anything he wants), but for six years more he's kept in a secret city sealed off from the rest of China, and no-one tells him that outside that city, China is no longer a monarchy, and he is no longer an emperor.This central situation has to be enough to sustain your interest: because there isn't much story further than the central premise here, like in most Bertolluci films. At 50 minutes it starts flagging, so Peter O'Toole is introduced. After another 25, another character is introduced - you get the idea.Luckily the concept is fairly intriguing - but honestly there's nothing you get from this picture that you don't get looking at the video box cover.

Pu Yi (Played as an adult by John Lone)is brought to the Forbidden City as a child and is made emperor. From that moment he becomes a prisoner of circumstance: He cannot leave the palace and even though he is still the emperor, his power is limited to the inhabitants of the Forbidden City since China is ruled by a republic.Pu Yi wants desperately to escape to the West, starting a new way of life (Going to Oxford is one of his dreams), but he instead escapes into marriage with Wan Jung (Joan Chen) and takes on a concubine (Secondary consort is her title) as well. When he is thrown out of the Forbidden City, he sees a chance to follow his dreams, but instead becomes a puppet for the Japanese, becoming emperor to the republic of Manchuria, resulting in his arrest toward the end of World War II. This results in a new change as he is re-educated and spends his remaining days as a gardener.Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci, we witness the sad tale of Pu Yi, an Emperor with no power, only used as a symbol.

An elegant and thoughtful film,"The Last Emperor is one of the best films of the 1980's  It is one of those rare examples in which every element comes together to create a film that is well- rounded in its excellence.Winner of 9 Academy Awards, the Last Emperor is without a doubt the greatestof Bernardo Bertolucci's career.  The film traces the life of the last emperor of China. He ruled from early 20th century through to the Chinese Revolution inthe 1940's.  Rich in historical moments, and culture, The Last Emperor is avisual masterpiece that accurately depicts the costume, architecture, andtraditions of Imperial China.   It is these elements, the costume/design, Art Direction, etc. that help make The Last Emperor what is was and undoubtedlywill remain.However, the film is not perfect and, in fact, has several flaws.  First, and absolutely foremost, the acting is nothing great.  Peter O'Toole and John Lone do decent work in the film but nothing great.  This is certainly not one of Peter O'Toole's better roles.   Arguably the practically emotion-less characterization of many of the characters in many of the scenes is part of the screenplay andrepresents the dignity of the Chinese soul.  However other films have done this well without having its characters seem  tired and empty  [Such as Raise theRed Lanterns]The story is well written but it is VERY slow  [and VERY long] I do not see any reason to blame the scriptwriter but instead believe that Bertolucci needed to address the tempo of the film.  Granted the tempo is what he wanted and I think that is the film's greatest weakness.  In areas, the film is downright boring.  This is, as I stated, no fault of the writing but instead of the director's intention to have this pace for the film.  And, arguably, that is a cultural artifact of the Imperial Chinese culture.  The methodical, ritualistic feel is authentic but too baneful for a film.7.5/10WARNING:  If you are not up to a nearly 4 hour epic that is slow and methodical I strongly urge you make sure you are watching the Theatrical Release it isunder 3 hours.

The Last Emperor,"This is a glorious film to watch on a big screen. It depicts the end of empire and the birth of new ones - and it does it in a spectacularly colourful and stylish fashion. The death of the Empress Dowager sees the toddler Pu Yi ascend the Dragon Throne of China, and live amidst concubines and eunuchs in the Forbidden City. He grows up believing his is a divine right to rule, and it is only upon the arrival of his tutor RJ (Peter O'Toole) and his procurement of spectacles that his eyes begin to be opened to the reality that his kingdom is entirely enclosed within a wall of golden yellow tiles. When this idyll is disrupted by warring events outside, the Emperor (now John Lone) sone finds himself a playboy, married to an opium addict (Joan Chen) and a useful puppet of the manipulative Japanese who have invaded much of his erstwhile realm. WWII arrives, power struggles ensue and the story of his eventual - and rather brutal - reintegration into the newly established Chinese communist society is depicted sensitively and without recourse to too much melodrama or sentiment. The score adds a wonderful richness to what is undoubtedly the star of this - the cinematography. Set inside the splendour of the actual Imperial Palace complex in Peking, we get a wonderful sense of the grandeur, isolation and luxury of life inside this sumptuously decorated collection of marble and brightly painted villas whilst outside, poverty and mysticism reigned more surely than did the occupant of the throne. The costume design is also remarkable - a perfect eye for the detail of the period from the start to the middle of the 20th Century. To be honest, the acting - aside from an engaging performance from the inquisitive and mischievous three year old (Richard Vuu) is all pretty routine. O'Toole features sparingly and doesn't quite fit the bill as the learned and worldly scholar. Lone and Chen are competent but they really only shine a light on the rather stilted dialogue. This isn't really a film about words - it's a film about visuals. It's about history, politics, corruption, betrayal - and even a little bit of love - all encased in a shell of creative elegance. It's wasted on the television - but is certainly one of the best examples of ""epic"" cinema yet made and Bertolucci has clearly invested a great deal of himself in this beautiful piece of drama. A must see, I'd say.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Moving and spectacular,"The Last Emperor is a rare achievement with lavish historical films in it that is compelling as well as moving, along with being spectacular. It captures with grace those last days of the Chinese empire and all its glory and terror. John Lone stars as the adult Pu Yi, a man of tragic fate but of noble principles. Lone shines in his part, as well as other actors like Joan Chen and Peter O'Toole, who plays the young Pu Yi's mentor.This visually splendid film can however prove exhausting, especially in its uncut version. But for all the negative criticism it has got, it never gets dull. Bertolucci has never done a movie like this before or after. The closest he got to it was with ""Little Buddha"", a movie not as good as this one. What else is there to say about it? It serves both as a history lesson for those who know little or nothing about the Chinese history before Mao and a feast for the eye. It is a lesson that can not be taken for granted. A story about a man who wanted to build a paradise, but ended in hell instead. I think the value of this film is everlasting.

A masterpiece that tells the history,"Watching this movie, it almost feels like me myself have seen that time in history, It's so real.John Lone really has done his work, from a perky young emperor, to the poor rickety old man who pays for a ticket to see a palace that used to be his, the acting is exquisite and layered. After finishing this movie, I felt a tremendous amount of empathy to Puyi, what he experienced in his entire life was just too much. He became the traitor of China simply because there was no other choice left for him. He wanted to reform a long time ago, he wanted the good for the country, he wanted to be a good ruler, sadly, none of those he achieved because of that particular time in history. He was too young and had no real power during his reign. Reading the history really saddens me, watching the movie more so...

A Look Into the Mind of a Ruler,"Many questions linger after this film.In the some odd seventeen years leading up to his death, the former emperor Pu Yi is defeated and unloved, long gone from the money and servants that framed the life that he leads us through in his flashbacks.  But had anything ever changed?  Much of the film shows him quite defeated and unloved, trapped in perhaps the most exclusive prison in the world.The director keeps in mind throughout this film that as he presents us the emperor, bit by bit, year by year, the audience must come to some opinion on how they view the man portrayed before them.  Will he be a man loved, or despised?  If no emotional attachment has been created, then the movie fails.My own opinion seems to have been caught between loving and hating him. Yes, the early scenes in which the emperor explores the limitless power and beauty bestowed upon him with child-like innocence and wonder are touching, but as he becomes a man, so does his world begin to be seen through the darkness and immorality of an adult.Never quite an ""absolute ruler"", the emperor's career seemed destined to fail by a world changing and advancing on its own far beyond his reach, both physically and symbolically.  Should we feel love for him because he has failed?  If Hitler had been unable to advance Nazi Germany to such imposing power in WWII, instead ending, let's say, as a lowly street sweeper, would not have film documentaries have crowned him the ingenious man that could have saved Germany from humiliation and poverty?Surely, Pu Yi had all the markings of an evil tyrant: the intimidating intelligence, the arrogance to challenge anyone or thing that defies him, and ultimately the will to mold any situation into his favor.There are many forces outside his grasp that shackle him, and inevitably he is indeed a failure, a joke.  But that is not enough to make me love him. It is an error to love a man for his failures, but rather one should love him for that which he contributes to life.  But what does Pu Yi contribute to his life?  His is littered with the bodies of those that have come into contact with him, a morbid graveyard created from deaths that did not come from his hands, but from his ego and his power.My inability to either love or hate him if anything makes him quite human. If he had been blatantly set up as an obvious protagonist or antagonist, the movie would have been flat, shallow.  Humans are hard things to find in movies these days, and here is a rare opportunity to catch a sight of one. Kudos to Bertolucci for such an intelligent film.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Review - The Last Emperor (TV Version),"Definitively, a grandiose piece of arts.One of The Last Emperor, is great strength is excellent production values, especially, in the costume design and production design, and Bertolucci's directing feels only more necessary as it develops the history and mystic surrounding the Forbidden City. Like Pu-Yi in his early years, we are new to the traditions and life of the emperors.Besides, I couldn't praise without mentioning the underappreciated performance of John Lone and Peter O'Toole.

Imperfect Storytelling Balanced by Strong Acting and Stunning Visuals!,"The Last Emperor is one of the final epics of old. It is a tale about the final emperor of China, Pu-Yi, and his descent from emperor to ordinary man. Unlike older epics like Lawrence of Arabia, there are hardly any action scenes or moments of intrigue. Instead, it is a story that tells the life of a government puppet within some major historical events. To me, that is what makes this story worthy of telling. It's not particularly about the life of an emperor, but about the transition of feudalism to the current state of communism of China's society. The movie is very long and can be slow at times, but in the end, Bernardo Bertolucci created a worthy epic. Worthy of Best Picture? Who knows. I do know that this is a visually stunning film that takes advantage of the Forbidden Kingdom with dazzling shots. The story can be imperfect at times with its tonal shifts, but it is a good learning device. I learned more about Pu-Yi and his ""worthiness"" to the powers that may be.
Bertolucci's epic is the first Western picture to ever be filmed in the Forbidden City. The director took advantage with this by creating such gorgeous visual shots. As an avid traveler, they really now make me want to visit the place which is home to so much history. As a film that needed to be approved by the Chinese government, apparently it was easier to work with the Chinese than the studio system. Outside of a few scribbles here or there, the authorities gave the production complete authority. The film was independently financed by producer Jeremy Thomas, as he was able to raise the necessary funds himself. He even had to use the phone pages to find potential financial backing. Regardless, he was able to produce the money. Columbia Pictures distributed the picture, but they did not feel comfortable doing so until very late in the game. It was not even a box office success, but it certainly wowed critics and award groups alike.
What I think the picture did successfully is portray the kind of person Hu-Yi (John Lone) was. From a very young age, he was denied access to the outside world as we see in the scene where he received a bicycle, but his own guards stopped him from leaving the grounds. For the man himself, his story is bittersweet. He abdicated the throne at the age of 7 and was handed to the Japanese and eventually handed to the Communists. He was certain that he was going to be killed at the hands of the Communists, but instead went through ""re-education camp"" where he would end his days as a farmer. It sounds so awful going from a somebody to a nobody, but it seems he was at his happiest working as a farmer. I personally felt the ending was really sad as he ended his life in an obscure fashion. Along the way, we see the man he would become. An independent thinker, someone who longs for the outside world and the European way (taught by his mentor R.J. Johnston, played by Peter O'Toole). This person was not really seen as a person, but as a means for people to use to help satisfy their personal goals.
The performances were fantastic. John Lone could have gotten an Oscar nomination and I would not have complained. He played Hu-Yi from the ages of twenty through sixty. Through the years, he really changed as a person and Lone was able to pull it off and make you sympathize towards the man who does not mean much as a person to others. An isolated loner who developed a skill for independent and philosophical thinking. Peter O'Toole also lent his charisma and does a great job in a supporting role.
The Last Emperor is the winner of nine Oscars. Bertolucci pulled off a difficult feat in putting this film together. His cinematographer, Vittorio Storaro gave us an impressive display of shots of a Chinese area that many Westerners have not seen. The score was an impressive blend of traditional music. The costumes felt genuine and were beautiful. The story itself is a little long and could have used better editing, but I liked how the several narratives were interwoven with one another. As someone who loves history, this was a learning lesson for me. I could not help but feel for this man who is treated as nothing. The ending is bittersweet for me. I liked how he was happy, but he was just a no one. I guess being happy it what matters in the end. I was very surprised this movie cleaned up at the Oscars. But for those who love long epics and can stand a little messy narrative, definitely give this a buzz.
My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,History
The structure of narrative is very clever.,"Biographical genre tends to be loose and boring because the narrative is linear, chronological, or predictable. However, in case of 'The Last Emperor', not only the story itself but also storytelling is interesting.First, Puyi's life right in the middle of Chinese's rapidly changing political turmoil is tragic and dramatic. Being a 'supposedly godlike' Emperor at so young an age in collapsing regime and always being forced to move around and caged his whole life can tell many interesting stories. Intriguing and refreshing topic from the get-go.More importantly, I want to praise how the movie tells these eventful affairs in organized and absorbing manner. The director uses the technique of 'story within a story'. Outer frame is about present Puyi and People's Republic of China while inner frame is about his past and Qing / Manchuria. The role of an Interrogator is important in connecting these two frames. An interrogator first states Puyi's action and explains more about political background and international affair at that time like how a history book would write about Puyi. Then, the flashback (inner story) of the that specific moment begins as a way of telling Puyi's own personal story from his perspective. Repetition of this pattern helps connect private life of Puyi to the world full of wars, colonialism, and nationalism in early 1900s and helps audience consumed to the film with organized narrative structure.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"What's It All About, Pu Yi?","This film used to be classified as ""Much Ado About Nothing,"" with the nothing being the character of Pu Yi, but the question after years of viewing and thought becomes, ""What's it all about?""  Bertolucci spends tons of money and showcases opulence on a epic scale to tell the story of a man who descended into anonymity, who journeyed from greatness into cypher-dom, who make terrible decisions and was guided by selfish desires.  The greatness of ""The Last Emperor"" is in that question; Bertolucci taunts and challenges his audience to digest the once-lived visuals, the pomposity of the circumstance and realize life's absurdity and folly.  ""The Last Emperor"" is a religious allegory, but instead of raising religion on a pedastal, Bertolucci mocks God and religion, ultimately praising humanism, as portrayed in the final shots, as an older, ""educated"" Pu Yi shares the only lasting joy and wonderful memory of his childhood, the grasshopper.Vittorio Storaro brings as much to the design of this film as Ferdinando Scarfiotti, masterfully working bold strokes of color to emphasis the film's emotion.  The contrast of Italian imagery with Eastern subject is a fantastic dissonance few filmmakers can successfully achieve.  The modern air these characters breathe lends credibility to Peploe's screenplay: human characters caught in the turmoil of intrigue and impending death always react in an amoral way, justifying their brutality as survival. Many of the supporting characters, while never gaining audience empathy, defend the argument of their actions of drug-abuse, treachery, and psychological cannibalism.Sexual frankness is always a element to Bertolucci's films and his restraint here is both sensual and offensive.  Brando sodomizes with butter, but the three-way here is performed under opaque silk, lending it a more sensual air, but shields us from forbidden, exotic sex.  Is the Orient still taboo? Must we only be privy to the hairy, primal animalistic behavior of European sexuality, and not voyeurs into the smooth, delicate moves of another region's sexual play?  It is a surprising move from such an erotically provocative director, and while one may actually blame Puttnam's regime (the releasing studio was Columbia Pictures) for the censorship, Bertolucci's artistic power should have won the argument.As a stand-alone work of art, discounting the crass nine Oscars and its piddling box office stature, this film is harmed by its use of flashback, a contrived device to show off symbolism and color, more than an indictment of the infant regime ""educating"" war criminals.  It doesn't know where to take this guilty verdict, as the film ends during the ""cultural"" revolution, depicting the never-ending flip-flopping of political ideologies.  Would it have been more powerful to unravel the linear story line from epic to personal?  It will forever remain unanswered.Joan Chen is an exciting presence, and with this film, proves herself one of the most beautiful woman in the world.  John Lone is adequate in the title role, but is intimdated by Bertolucci's direction.  While passionate as a child, the character's battles become more internal and do not register. As a device, it supports the thesis of the character, but as a performance it loses the audience's interest.  We become more fascinated with the cruelty of the household than the political intrigues that forced Pu Yi's hand to the Russians. A more defiant Lone may have struggled with Bertolucci, but the result would have been a more fascinating portrayal.Despite criticism, this remains a film that must be viewed in letterbox and in surround sound (if possible).  Its title sequence alone is worth the price of admission and is a hell of a precursor to the experience one has watching this film.  The score (credited to three composers), is melodramatic and luscious, working our emotions and exhilirating the piece. It is gorgeous and enhances our experience.  It is recommended to cinema lovers everyone and the challenge remains to answer the question: ""What's it all about?""",,Anonymous,History
Epic in Every Sense of the Word,"I really enjoyed this film. Compared to some epics today, this might be considered a touch slower, but it is still an incredibly well done film. The sheer scope of the world that Bertolucci shows us is immense and breathtaking, and the journey he takes us on is simply unforgettable.

"The Last Emperor (1987) Starring John Lone Informs Us ""It's Lonely At The Top""","The Last Emperor (1987) starring John Lone, Joan Chen, and Peter O'Toole won the ""Best Picture"" Academy Award for 1987, and is a curious departure from movies which usually win that honor.The movie is about China and a man chosen by the Chinese Empress Dowager in 1908 to be the next Emperor of China (the little boy named ""Pu Yi"" was one of many princes the polygamous and dead former Chinese Emperor left behind, and was not the son of the Empress Dowager).The toddler aged little boy begins his life in the monster royal palace in Peking (later renamed ""Beijing"") in a royal building complex called the Forbidden City, and grows to early manhood there.China becomes a Republic in 1911, and the Chinese Monarchy ends, but the young Emperor is allowed to continue life in the Forbidden City into his early manhood in the 1920's when he and his two young wives are evicted by the unstable, warlord dominated, constantly changing government system which had replaced the monarchy.The young evicted monarch and his wives keep their considerable fortune, and move to a coastal city in China and live ""the good life"" as rich people there until 1931 when the former Manchuria (NW China) becomes a newly named country called ""Manchukuo"" and the young ex-Emperor of China is installed as the new monarch of the new country.He remains in that job as Head Of State until the end of World War II, and is taken prisoner by the invading Russians who turn him over to the Chinese Communists who gain control of China in 1949, and keep the former Emperor of China and Monarch of Manchuria (aka Manchukuo) imprisoned for 10 years until he is released in bad health in 1959, only 53 years old, but looking much older, and clearly a broken man.His final years are spent in Peking (Beijing) where he dies in 1967 during the Chinese Cultural Revolution Chairman Mao organized to delay the invasion of capitalist money into China and the start of China as a huge sweatshop for WalMart and other western business enterprises.The Emperor had a rich and glamorous life up to 1945, and a hard life from 1945 when the Communists were about to take over China, which they achieved in 1949.The movie starts out showing the Emperor as a prisoner in 1950, and we see his former expensive ""easy living"" life in flash backs. The Communists who imprisoned the Emperor throughout the 1950's demanded that the Emperor confess his crimes, sins, shortcomings, etc. etc., and the movie alternates between his time in the 1950's as a prisoner when he recalls his past, and flash backs of his memories of it.The prison life he lives is dull and gray and awful and ugly. The previous life is colorful and attractive in most ways.The Last Emperor (1987) starring John Lone is a visual treat since most of the movie centers around ""the good old days"" of the Emperor's pre-1945 life in the Forbidden City, as a rich civilian in a coastal Chinese city in the 1920's, and as Monarch of Manachuria (aka Manchukuo)from 1931 through 1945.The colors, particularly the gaudy use of red and gold, are dazzling.The music score and presentation in the movie are very well done.The movie is a 1980's Reagan era ""rich is best, greed is good"" testimonial. The Chinese Emperor lives like Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas) did in Wall Street (1985). Rich and happy.""I've been rich and I've been poor,"" Mae West was once quoted as saying.

visually stunning but overrated historical epic,"first of all, the thing that killed this movie for me was the use of english instead of chinese or mandarin or whatever language they would have used. hearing whiny american accents coming out of the actors mouth's truly cheapened the film and made it obvious it was being catered for the american audiences. it was obvious bertolluci was trying for an oscar and he succeeded to his credit.peter o toole i thought was just plain bad as the teacher, he overacted and didnt play a huge role in the film. in fact, most of the actors in this film shoud have been replaced by unknowns or at least genuine chinese actors. seeing the credits i noticed many of the actors had japanese names, which detracted from the realism. also, many were american actors that were recognisable from other poor films: the weird eyed old man from Big trouble in Little China and the dude from Rising Sun, just to name a couple. all these different factors truly detracted from the realism of the film.the character Pu Yi himself was sooooo unlikeable, and i know he was supposed to be spoiled and selfish and unlikeable, yet wheres the enjoyment in seeing a 3 hour movie focusing on 1 character who really gives me the s***s? by the end i was hoping the chinese would start the water torture on him.the best thing about the film was the visuals by far, which is hardly surprising since the DOP was Vitorio Storaro, one of the all time great cinematographers.overall, i believe this film is definately worth watching, yet i would not have given this flawed film the best picture oscar...i dont know, maybe 87 was a bad year for films? it is overrated, despite the stunning visuals. 6.5/10",,Anonymous,History

An Overrated Masterpiece,"The new widescreen DVD of the ""director's cut"" of ""The Last Emperor"" (1987:*** out of ****) has nearly an hour of new material, but I'm not sure the added footage improves things too much.  The movie looks great, of course, but I think the main reason why I've always found ""Last Emperor"" tedious going is that the title character is really a pretty dull fellow. While young, would-be emperor Pu Yi is playing with his eunuchs, taking lessons from his tutor, and rolling around in bed with his 2 wives (with a little unlikely bisexual titillation to liven things up), tumultuous, world-changing historical events are happening outside the walls of the Forbidden City.  While Bertolucci's camera drinks in the sights of the emperor's opulent, self-indulgent life-style, we're held prisoner inside the palace along with him.  Time after time, potentially exciting spectacle (like the burning down of the palace storehouse by the eunuchs) is happening offscreen.  Pu Yi is never an active participant in his country's historical development, even after he is set up as the puppet emperor of Japanese-controlled Manchuria later in the story.  At over 3 hours, the film becomes almost as vacuous as the leading character; the director seems to be more enamoured of pageantry than drama.  Still, the film's subject is a unique one and it remains worthwhile, if ultimately a little trivial and overblown.",,Anonymous,History

"For all its limitations, an absorbing study of a paradoxical history","A resplendent and often illuminating historical pageant that's also resolutely undramatic and, until the final (somewhat rushed) segment, astonishingly apolitical considering its subject matter and its director's career.  Its subject is broader than politics, perhaps: the shape of history, personal and public, and how those two shapes interact.Pu Yi, played by three actors and followed over six decades, is an emblem of historical change, a fulcrum between tradition and modernity (as well as between east and west) who always contrives to be ill-suited to his imperial role and perhaps his citizen's role too, until the moment when that role has definitively become mere history, vanished into museum culture. Pu Yi's radical lack of an identity may be a dramatic liability, but it's a central and necessary preoccupation for the film; its more serious weaknesses lie in the screenplay's tendency towards banality at the verbal level, and some decidedly mixed performances in the supporting cast.  The principals are pretty much beyond reproach in what was never going to be an actors' film, and both Peter O'Toole and (in particular) Joan Chen find some substance in roles that are quite superficially written.  Only the surfaces of things and people are accessible here, and the emperor himself is a man who is nothing but surface.  He has no hidden depths, only hidden shallows.Perhaps the energy that really drives this film is the tension between its lush cinematography and its broadly left-wing sympathies.  Storaro's photography is lavish and celebratory; it adores material luxury of whatever kind - traditional Chinese or 1920s faux-Parisian or whatever - without reservation.  Bertolucci's camerawork meanwhile is austere, as restrained as the performances, and the emotional and intellectual temperatures are much cooler than the colour scheme. Not surprisingly, given China's official approval of the project, it is largely anodyne in its account of the People's Republic, but the closing segment is sufficiently barbed.  The snapshot of the continuing revolution, with its Maoist quasi-imperial cult, presents a country that has not changed at all, whilst the final glimpse of contemporary Beijing presents a country that has changed everything, surrendered to the westernisation which Pu Yi championed (the very existence of Forbidden City footage is testament to this).  China emerges as a country in which revolution and stasis are twins, and in the present century everything and nothing has changed.",,Anonymous,History
Perfect Biographical Movie,"I love biographical movies a lot. This movie gives all things that I expect. The Last Emperor portrays Far Asia Culture perfectly based on ""real"" historical background. This movie describes cultural and political changing of China Empire successfully, though describing of changing countries and cultures is way too diffucult thing in history as a branch of science. Bertolucci approaches the subject as though he is a historian. Fans of history and biography must definitely watch this movie. I heavily recommend The Last Emperor. 10/10 in point of history and biography.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful and intelligently constructed,"I didn't intend to review this film when I threw it on. I bought it because it's great, and I just wanted to watch it again, but then I read Roger Ebert's review and I felt like he completely and totally misinterpreted the ending. And then I read the essay that came with the Criterion Blu-Ray by David Thompson that seemed completely scattershot and talked more about the rest of Bertolucci's career rather than The Last Emperor itself. So, I just felt like I needed to get my own thoughts down.Much of the conversation around this movie is about how China allowed Bertolucci to film in The Forbidden City. Ooo...aaaa...amazing. Okay, that's done.Snark aside, the movie is a visual delight, and it is in no small part because of the expansive location that is the Forbidden City that that works. This story needs to feel big because it is the story of two things that are the intimately related. The first is the eponymous last emperor Puyi, and the second is China itself. The connection makes sense without even considering the details of the story, but the way the story plays out (which I assume, like I assume with all historical movies, is roughly 90% ahistorical). Puyi's brief childhood reign as emperor leads to time as an accepted figurehead in China, a puppet for Japan, prisoner of the Communist Chinese government, and then a modest gardener. As he progresses through this story, the country around him changes along with him.One of the things that bugged me about Roger Ebert's review was that he described Puyi as passive. That's only partially true. He was never able to directly affect any major events, but he tried. He tried a lot. From his time as a boy where he climbed off of his throne to wander and founds only his supplicants to his affirmative effort to become Japan's puppet emperor of Manchukuo throughout the Second World War, Puyi was trying to assert his will upon his household and China overall. The problem was that every time he tried, he received pushback of a proportional nature. His effort to bicycle out of the Forbidden City after his abdication is met by a closed gate, but his effort to assert China's independence alongside Japan is met by hostility from Japan, effectively ending his faux-reign before he's captured by the Russians (and then handed off to the Chinese).Ebert asserted that the re-education Puyi receives is successful because he never really had an education in the world, and I think it's one of the most wrong-headed things he ever wrote. Puyi received an intimate education about the workings of the world from his secluded spot away from things. It was a hard education, but he did receive it. The re-education he is forced in prison doesn't actually work, but over that time Puyi learns his smallness in his own life. His reflection on his contributions to his life and the history of China are minimal at best, represented best by his inability to function without a servant for the first time in his life. It's not that he became a good communist, it's that he spent 10 years thinking about his life with little else to do. It's only when he takes up gardening that he finds something he can influence. It's small, but he can make the world better in a very small little way.Puyi's journey is compelling in his continual efforts to make changes in his life, but it's brought to life visually and there's much more to talk about than the Forbidden City when it comes to The Last Emperor's visuals. Vittorio Storaro, the film's cinematographer is one of the greatest of his craft, and he used color intelligently and explosively in this film. The vibrant colors of the imperial period end up mirroring the bright colors of the period in Puyi's life where he's out of prison in Communist China (1967), implying a connection between the two eras with Puyi's drab, colorless prison period in between. I think he's saying that little has actually changed in China. The children's marching and singing in praise of Mao in the streets evokes the singing death chant of the Empress Dowager at the beginning of the film. It's still a highly centralized society with deep inclinations towards pomp and circumstance.The movie is sumptuous visually, compellingly acted, intimately involved in the history of the country, grand in scale, and intimate in scope. It's a triumph of cinema and one of the best movies of the 80s.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Dramatic fairy-tale,"I've seen this movie so many times and it was the first DVD I bought right after I purchased my DVD-player.Fortunately this movie wasn't made by Americans. They could never realize, nor understand this level of cinematography and would turn it into a Pearl Harbor (Oh my!).What makes this movie great, is the way the movie continuously shows what seems  to be a fairy-tale, but what is in fact nothing more but a play. A play played in China, suffering extraordinary changes itself. As Pu Yi mentions himself: a theatre without an audience. Left long ago.This movie focuses on a single man, trying to make a change, but fails, for he is nothing but a puppet, controlled by the Japanese, as he for years was a puppet for China. He is eager to be in control, simply in order to make those changes reality, makes him an easy target for the Japanese. He grows up to be served and to be seen as the almighty and cannot hold himself up in New China, where there is no place for an emperor any longer.The only persons that seems to do well in this new environment, is the woman who had in fact even less freedom; Pu yi's second wife. She claims her freedom after being settled in England.Because The Last Emperor focuses on Pu Yi and his relatives, while moving the political issues  to the background, makes this movie so 'uneasy' to look at. There is this wonderful story of a little lad who grows up in an ancient surrounding, but there is always the noise from beyond the walls he doesn't understand. He cannot understand why everything from beyond those walls (his brother paying him a visit now and then, Johnson, his tutor) seems to move on. Within those walls, time seems to stand still and everybody near him appears so eager to keep the 'real' world outside the walls of the Forbidden City.The music makes this movie complete. A movie without good music is half wasted. It matches perfectly with the emotions, time and location. Surely Bertolucci's best movie.",,Anonymous,History

Good But Rather Mainstream,"Practically custom made to win Academy Awards, ""The Last Emperor"" did just that in 1987, winning every single award for which it was nominated. Bernardo Bertolucci's sprawling historical epic is beautiful to look at, but it also has a brain in its head, something rare for the usual Best Picture winner. Still, it's one of the most accessible films Bertolucci has ever made, and one has to wonder if it would have received the acceptance it did had it not been so mainstream. After all, Bertolucci's masterpiece, ""The Conformist"", a far better film than ""The Last Emperor"" in almost every way, was almost completely ignored by the stuffy Academy back in 1971.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,History
Puyi: Opportunistic criminal or man caught up in whirlwind of change?,"What is an emperor, who has been told all his life that he is meant to rule, supposed to do when he no longer has an empire? It is easy to condemn the Emperor Puyi as a weak willed collaborator and monarchist and to reasonably wonder why anyone would want to make a movie about such an apparently vacuous person. But Puyi's life was tragic and as such provides the basis for an excellent historical drama. Puyi never asked to be emperor, which was the only job he was ever trained to do, and after having been evicted from his palace ... which was his home ... sought refuge with the Japanese who took him in and gave him a job, the only job he was ever trained to do. So can it be any wonder why the dispossessed emperor would have had some affinity for the Japanese? John Lone gives a great performance as the dispossessed and unhappy emperor and Joan Chen is equally impressive as his depressed and opium addicted wife who was the classic innocent victim and who did nothing to deserve her vile mistreatment by her own people. Mrs. Puyi was so utterly harmless that the mere thought of anyone wanting to mistreat her is sad and troubling. This movie dramatizes a universal theme - the challenges associated with adapting to relentless change as one tries to maintain their emotional equilibrium and sense of identity while all the landmarks of their lives are rapidly disappearing. Was Puyi a opportunistic criminal? Or was he a man caught up in a whirlwind of change that ultimately proved to be his undoing and then his redemption?",10.0,Anonymous,History

Chinese Empiral Servants and the love of ones country,"The Chinese say crickets and mantis insects are ""Lucky"" bugs. In this movie I think the drama captured the political unrest with enthusiasm and vigor for a memorable experience of the Chinese national transition in respect to the imperial household and society's' national Chinese identity through political change. Being the Emperor must be very difficult during this time period. I am not so sure about the moral, ethical, and pathos displayed and depicted with the royal household in this movie. Since servants are trained professionally from a young age with strict discipline some of the un-ethical and immoral acts by the emperor seem very hard to believe. Such as the use of drugs, and illicit sex uncommon to the use of concubines which was more historical. Actually because the cricket was still alive in the end of this movie I still think the Royal Household still exists in a non-formal intangible way within the society of China or else-where through Chinese mysticism. Somewhat symbolized in the spirituality where guidance exists through family lineage found in wisdom. Even in the Walt Disney movie Mulan the use of knowledge, science, and society was always a common theme to defeat the enemy with the help of the spiritual family lineage and presence of social brotherhood symbolized by a combination of mushu the dragon, ""Lucky"" cricket, and sword of the father through reflection of this social wisdom.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A unique and indispensable Motion Picture...,"THE LAST EMPEROR is a wonderful and compelling film dealing with the historic events that surround the life of The Forbidden Palace's Last Emperor, Pu Yi, in a dramatic and non-linear fashion.Those who are aware of the (hi)story will know that Pu Yi was in essence, nothing more than a 'puppet' Emperor and a tool, rather than a being of great worldly power. While he had almost absolute control of his subjects within his Empire, he was seen as more of a prisoner, involuntarily trapped within the confines of the Empire. Bernardo Bertolucci does extremely well to portray this to viewers, as there are many scenes in which viewers are made to pity Pu Yi's situation.THE LAST EMPEROR is a superb film featuring some of the best cinematography, set direction, costume design, and music of all time. The screenplay is simply magnificent, and viewers will find themselves totally drawn into the film as it progresses. The pacing of this film is a strong part of what makes it so great, as it never seems to sprawl for long periods of time. Taking home 9 Oscars (including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay) in a relatively good year for Motion Pictures is no fluke.

Great film,"Great film. The only film I can compare to this is Lawrence of Arabia. That film is slightly better than this one, but both are sprawling epics that make you feel like you're in the front of a roller-coaster that's rushing through the past. While that film is more ambitious and better-acted, I actually personally prefer this one more. It's involving and atmospheric and one of the best-shot movies of the century. Every time I pop it in, I am enraptured. There is so much work put into every scene. The makeup, the art direction, the style; this is dedication incarnate. The Last Emperor is like The Lord of the Rings or Titanic: you may not like these movies, but you have to respect how much work went into them on every front imaginable. There are times when I can't believe what I'm seeing wasn't made for quick on the computer, but then I notice how real it all seems.The plot is simple and not the focus. John Lone (as well as a few other actors of varying age) plays Puyi, the titular 'Last Emperor'.

Slow year for oscars?,"Perhaps I was just sleepy, but I was somewhat disappointed in this film. I didn't realize it won best picture until after I watched it, so I watched it again in the hopes of seeing something I missed. I only made in half way through. When I read that it won all 9 of the Oscars for which it was nominated, I was even more surprised when I looked at some of the categories. Best picture? I guess compared to the other nominees, that's possible. Best cinematography - sure, it is a gorgeous film. Best costuming - yes, absolutely. Best sound - perhaps, I don't know how this is judged, although I can think of at least one instance where a ""sound effect"" didn't even match the action, but I'd rather not get into it. Best score? This I take great issue with. The main theme was poignant, but incessantly repetitive. And shallow, without depth or variety. It made the film sound like a T.V. movie of the week. When I saw that John Williams was up for an award that year and LOST to this score I was shocked. I expect Williams would do better humming in the shower than what we got here. I wish he HAD scored this film, it might not have been so tedious. Best editing? I don't know - there were definitely things going on that didn't make sense (in my opinion) that might have been more clear with either better direction or editing. Also, sequences that could have been shorter were not cut, scenes that needed more development were prematurely dropped. Overall the acting was very good, with O'Toole giving a wonderful performance, as usual. In fact, I liked all the actors and performances.

It deserved all the accolades - how does this deserve a 7?,"We see his life as one unlikely person, the one person that one would have most expect to have been insulated, in a gigantic tragedy -- that of China between the chaotic beginning of what might have been a long reign and the destructive Cultural Revolution of Mao, with coups, warlord rule, World War II, and the Marxist Revolution culminating in the rise of Mao. One recognizes that the pathologies of imperial China never truly died, but merely took new forms in the cult of the Leader. That the scenery is beautiful and hedonism among elites is rife hardly conceals the fact that China was a political Hell.Pu Yi, once the Emperor of the great (but decrepit) Chinese Empire, becomes Emperor of the Forbidden Palace in 1912 before he is expelled in one of many violent revolutions (this one in 1925) in China. We see him doing a few things right, like reforming the Palace bureaucracy from a den of thieves into something honorable. He gets a superb adviser in Reginald Johnston, who gave him the confidence to be a political figure -- even a good one -- in the happiest time of his life. Johnston leaves as Pu Yi is expelled from the Palace, and eventually falls under the spell of the Japanese, who rip Manchuria from China and find someone willing to rule it in an enlightened manner -- himself. The Prime Minister of his choosing is killed, and Pu Yi becomes a puppet ruler of a contemptible entity. It's just like the old days, only the intriguers are worse -- far worse. The decrepitude of the system sets in at the first moment. As Emperor he can only accede to what his Japanese overlords demand.At the end of the war he is arrested by the Soviets because he dallies too long on unfinished business -- and after the 1949 Revolution he is sent back to China as a war criminal and traitor. Rather than being executed (as one might expect) he is sent to prison as a convict.As a prisoner he is incarcerated with some of his former underlings -- war criminals of the Manchukuo puppet state -- who have learned to ape the ideology of their captors, and he runs afoul of those 'fellow' inmates. Ex-fascists make the most fervent communists. All in all, he simplifies and becomes a very ordinary man in a society that punished anyone who challenged anything that the regime didn't want people to challenge.Pure puppet? Not quite. A dupe who never left when the going was good -- if the going was ever good -- and that is exactly what the Imperial role made him. In childhood the ruler of the greatest empire (in population size, that is) on Earth -- in a premature old age, a cipher. Then again, what else did most Chinese ever become in China during the first two thirds of the 20th century become -- ciphers, old before their time, wrecks of no fault of their own, just to survive.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Reversal Of Fortune,"Reversal Of Fortune I saw this film when it was first released on video in 1988 and its power has never diminished.It is very easy to see how this won NINE Academy Awards including ""Best Picture."" It visually stuns the senses. It's important to remember that in 1987 the communists were only beginning to open up China's national treasures to the western tourists. Unless you were a student of Chinese history, for most of the audience this was their first look at the Forbidden City. The Forbidden City restored to its 1908 glory was itself deserving of ""Best Picture."" Any film set almost entirely the Forbidden City is truly bold. There is no comparison for a more powerful visual setting. The fact that they filmed in the real palace and not just a Hollywood set is overpowering.Bernardo Bertolucci uses his visual masterpiece to emphasize the dramatic reversals of fortune in Pu Yi's life. Arguably more of a reversal than almost any historical figure.Bertolucci uses flashbacks to visually contrast Pu Yi's pathetic existence as a political prisoner of the communists in the 1950s to his awesome childhood being crowned the sole ruler of 500,000,000 people at age 3 and being raised in the splendor of the Forbidden City.Only a few years later Pu Yi would find himself an exile in his own royal palace during the Chinese democratic and nationalist revolutions. He had no power, no talents, no friends or family. As he says in the film. ""The Forbidden City had become a theatre without an audience. Yet the actors remained on stage only to steal the set piece by piece."" When he asks, ""Am I emperor?"" a eunuch answers, ""In the Forbidden City your majesty will always be emperor."" A harsh reality meaning ""No."" The only thing worse than being a prisoner of the Forbidden City was the being forced to leave it. With no out a home Pu Yi fled towards China's worst enemy during the time, the Japanese whom also held him captive for their own purposes.The film does not portray Pu Yi as good or evil, smart or stupid, but just one of the most tragic figures of history. We see him as an innocent toddler without any power or love in his life. Sadly this never changed.The often overlooked aspects of the film are the superb acting and dramatic musical score. John Lone is amazing throughout. Ric Young as the communist interrogator is very memorable and it's easy to see why he's always cast as an Asian villain. ""It is not an accusation! You are a traitor!

An Epic - One of the Best of Genre,"The Last Emperor is the story of China's tumultuous last century seen through the eyes of it's last emperor who takes over the throne in his infancy. He sees China go through intense change from Conservative Monarchy, Democratic Revolution, WWII/Japanese Occupation, Civil War, Communist Takeover and finally Mao's Cultural Revolution. In the course of these seven decades, his own life goes from immense privilege through much upheaval and tragedy.From the magnificent beauty of the Forbidden City and the cloistered life behind its walls through the ensuing decades, the screenplay, acting, cinematography and costumes all rise to the level of China's incredible 20th century. Bertolucci is a master storyteller who reveals the tragic personal story of the young emperor while giving a fascinating Chinese history lesson for all the ages.If you have the slightest interest in Chinese history, the movie will amaze and educate. The fact that China began a major resurgence since the movie's release in 1987 only makes The Last Emperor even more relevant to global audiences. I don't know whether The Last Emperor deserves Top 100 or Top 500, but it certainly deserves much more respect. I think viewers who prefer American themes with faster pacing might be disappointed.",,Anonymous,History
film review,"The movie The Last Emperor shows in the year 1987 as a 166 minutes film. The director of this film is Bernardo Bertolucci. He is an Italian director. The movie The Last Emperor is a China, Italy, the United Kingdom jointly produced movie. It tells the story of Pu Yi. He is the last emperor of China. This movie is the first fully cooperated with the government of mainland China and shot in mainland China to complete the production Western film since the Chinese Communist Party to hold the reins of government in 1949. This movie has created several Chinese film and television history: the first in the Forbidden City viewfinder feature film rather than the piece of information, and is completely cleared to remove the fence framing. This is the first time Bernardo Bertolucci tells the story of China. This film won the 1987 Academy Award nine awards. And this film is the first film about China which won the Academy Award. This film is the first time Chinese people did not make any restrictions of movie content. The AIXINJUELUO Pu Yi is the last monarch of the Qing Dynasty, since the emperor Qin Shi Huang established system. I think the movie The Last Emperor is a great momentum, rich colors, and the scene was spectacular, superb skills epic. The storyline of the film is according to the memory of Pu Yi. The film begins in the winter at the year 1950. In this year, Pu Yi as a war criminal from the Soviet Union was escorted back to China. Pu Yi believed that to survive, so he slipped into the bathroom, and attempted to commit suicide. Then Pu Yi caught in a memory. Then movie began to tell us the story of Pu Yi also in winter at the year 1908 as he was 3 years old. From the film we can easily find though Pu Yi is a monarch, but when he began to reign he was just 3 years old. So when held enthronement, he just pay attention to the grasshopper, he cannot see the civil and military ministers. Then the shot came back to he stand trial, accept the prisoner's life of transformation. So he met his brother Pu Jie, then he retrospect 40 years before. At that time, he knew that he had the supreme powers, so he began to wanton tease and maltreatment eunuchs. In the year 1919, Pu Yi began to accept the influence of Western culture. For this his life style has been changed. Then the shot came back again, as he was required to tell the whole his stories, then the film go on to talk about the things in the year 1924. When he was telling his stories, the shots always back to the prison. From these we can see the change of Pu Yi, he from a do not know how to wear clothes emperor to one can take care of himself and engage in light work of civilians. In the year 1959, Pu Yi was special amnestied, then he was working in the Beijing Botanical Garden. Emperor it represents a ""royal prerogative"" paramount right lines in the movie is: ""Long live, you can do anything."" But the identity of the emperor never bring true happiness to him, childhood, he is the most lonely child inside the walls, until he became manipulated by the Japanese puppet emperor, he never really be able to call the shots for themselves over, everything is not of his own choosing, even the woman he married. Pu Yi's life is the ever-changing period in China's political and ideological. From the color of Forbidden City oil painting of red and golden, the light of the National Government faint light and pale, the color in posters of the Cultural Revolution green and red all implied this. In the film can find something wrong, at the beginning of the film there appears a painting ""to in Jinggangshan enter"" in 1950, but in fact, this painting was created in the 1970s. Maybe because the director is a Italian, so he do not know in the Qing Dynasty, they call mother is eniang, not the mum. And in part of the year of 1931 in the film, you can find there appear simplified Chinese, but in fact at that time, China was using the traditional characters. I think these points appear was because they do not know too much of China, so they may not find these mistakes.",,Anonymous,History
I am a little sympathetic with him.,"I like history and politics very much, especially some mysterious events of the history and the history of the Qing Dynasty . This film just provides me with such a good opportunity. This film is a mixture of the narration from Pu Yi in his prison term and the life when he was still an emperor, so at first, I was a little puzzled, just the same as the feeling when I was watching the ""The Da Vinci Code"".But a few minutes later, I catch the clue. In the estimation of the world, the life of an emperor is wonderful: luxurious, comfortable, sovereign In a word, it is ideal, and what all of us are dreaming of. However, it is an exception in this film. Yes, Pu Yi will never be worried about his physical life and he will never know what is the poverty, but his owning of these things is in expense of his freedom, which, in my opinion, is the most valuable thing to a person. Pu Yi was an emperor, but to be more exact, he was just a prisoner, a tool of those western governments. So Ifeel a little sympathetic with him.",,Anonymous,History
The Last Emperor,"Directed by legendary Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci, this incredible page of history brings the light on what happened during the transition from the old Chinese Empire to the dark days of the communist government. Quite sad in a way but close the facts & actual events of the time, the film depicts without any glorification, the life story of one of the most fascinating character of the 20th century. Beautifully shot, acted by some of the most amazing actors around & benefiting of a good budget, this film is from another age, a time when cinema was still able to transport you into another world & make you dream.Bertolucci has created a masterpiece, a must see for any cinephile out there wishing to enlarge their personal culture.",,Anonymous,History
impressive  fresco,"about solitude, power, illusion and sense of events. about ambiguous power and shining of an age. about innocence. and about cruelty.it is not an history lesson. can be only a parable. and magnificent show. because each scene is refined jewelery. because music is more than support for images; it is a character. so, the emperor is reflection of a fragile fight against times. not exactly a victim or a pray. because the end is testimony of great and delicate victory. the name of emperor may be Louis XVI of France. or Nicholas II of Russia .or Mihai I of Romania. the story is not very different. only its last parts. he can be drawing of many children /adults profile , subjects of different forms of sacrifice. but it is only a masterpiece. ant that is enough.",,Anonymous,History
