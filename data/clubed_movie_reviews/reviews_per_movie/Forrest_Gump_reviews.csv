Life's Lessons in one Movie...,When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie. And anyone who hasn't seen it or who thinks that don't like it I seriously suggest seeing it or seeing it again. It truly is amazing...,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A beautiful fable for now and the future,"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way. So if you have not seen the movie,see it soon you are in for a real treat. If you did not like it, give it a try again and hopefully you will see it for the great story it is!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Let's see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump,"""I've made about 20 films and 5 of them are pretty good""-Tom Hanks.""Forrest Gump"" is one of the best movies of all time, guaranteed. I really just love this movie and it has such a special place in my heart. The performances are just so unforgettable and never get out of your head. The characters, I mean the actors turned into them and that's what got to me. The lines are so memorable, touching, and sometimes hilarious.We have Forrest Gump(Tom Hanks), not the sharpest tool in the box, his I.Q. is right below the average scores. But his mama(Sally Field) believes that her boy has the same opportunities as anyone else and lets Forrest know that there's nothing that could hold him back. As a boy he is put into braces for his legs since he has a crooked back and really doesn't have too many friends. When he gets on a school bus for his first day of school, NO ONE will let him sit next to them. This scene is so heart breaking until you hear a little angel's voice ""You can sit here if you want"". Jenny, Forrest's best friend and crush, she looks so incredibly innocent and you love her because her and Forrest are like pea's and carrots. But we find out that there is an extremely unfortunate side to her life, she has a father that's ""always kissing and touching her and her sisters"". Forrest just assumes that it's a father's love since he doesn't have a dad that could show him that it's wrong.Forrest and Jenny together walk every day from school and when these kids start throwing rocks at Forrest calling him stupid, Jenny just tells Forrest ""Run, Forrest! Run!"". He miraculously breaks the braces off his legs and run like the wind blows. Forrest meets many celebrities from his life that just happened to be there: Elvis Presley visited his house before hitting it big, President Kennedy honored him with a all American football award, President Johnson who honored him with a medal of honor for his actions in Vietnam, President Nixon(in which Forrest happens to discover a problem in the Water Gate Hotel because some people seem to be flashing lights around), and John Lennon through a talk show to talk about his medal of honor.Forrest meets some interesting people along the way too that are even better than these celebrities combined; Bubba his Vietnam war friend who dreams of owning a shrimp boat one day and was born with big gums. He is just so wonderful and charming and won't stop talking about shrimp. Luteniet Dan, a leader of Forrest's army in Vietnam who gets saved by Forrest during a huge attack and looses his legs as a result. Luteniet Dan was by far my favorite character, he has so much pride and wants to die in Vietnam due to his family history tradition of dying in every single American war. He and Forrest make quite a pair. And of course there's Jenny, a very tragic figure, she gets more mean as she grows up because she knows that Forrest loves her, in some ways you can't blame her really. She was obviously abused and I think she felt that Forrest was too good for her or that he couldn't really give her the love she wanted. Robin Wright, what a beautiful and wonderful actress.This movie is incredible and should be seen by everyone. I am not kidding, ""Forrest Gump"" is a remarkable movie and inspires everyone. It's not just about someone stupid who happens to be in great places and historic events just because of being in the right place at the right time. This story is beautiful and will inspire everyone to go the distance and see the world like Forrest did and will never give up on their dreams.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"In my opinion, no film has touched me more than this one.....","Quite simply, the greatest film ever made.Humour, sadness, action, drama and a Vietnam film all rolled into one.I'm not a stone cold, heartless villain, but it takes a lot to make me cry when I watch a movie. Bambi's mother, I couldn't care less. Jimmy Stewart in, ""Oh, what a wonderful life,"" - yeah right! The Lion King, when Mufasa bites the big one - on the verge.But seriously - I bawled my big brown eyes out, on several occasions in this film. A real tear-jerker, and a wonderful character, played to perfection by Tom Hanks. Every bit as worthy for the Oscar as Rooney was to win the Premiership in 2007.I cannot say it enough: This is THE film of all time. Watch it, and you'll see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The zen of Forrest Gump.,"This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. One comment I've never heard is that Forrest's simplicity is almost zen-like. I should read the novel to get the author's intention (I remember some people preferring the book and complaining that no one at the Academy Awards gave him any credit.) But rather than an implication that you should do what you're supposed to do and believe in God and you'll win in the end, I see it as zen-like, i.e., living in the moment and not having expectations or particular cravings (other than his loving Jenny.) So he ends up just stumbling into all the major historical events of the time. Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Thirty years on, and it's still as wonderful.","A very eventful time in America's history, seen through the eyes of one man, Forest Gump, a man who has a very low IQ, a score of just 75.Tom Hanks, we all know just how good an actor he is, but there is something about his performances here that's extra special, he is simply outstanding. He's given many great performances over the years, this has always stood out.Forest sees Vietnam, the moon landings, presidential changes, and experiences a tough childhood and army life, all relayed from a public bench.It's funny, it's moving, it's wonderfully quirky. I have always loved the way they placed him into historical footage, that scene with John Lennon a personal favourite. It's a long film, but it's one that simply flies by.The music is fabulous throughout, some of the best, and most memorable songs of the time, you'll hear the likes of The Mamas and Papas, Scott McKenzie and many more, it's a terrific soundtrack.I saw it aged 14 when it was first released, and maybe didn't appreciate it at the time, now though, I think it's a captivating watch.Keep on running Forest.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Purity and innocence retained,"I have seen this movie easily a half a dozen times, and I find that the beauty of the film is how Forrest Gump not only shares his innocence and purity with others, including the audience, he also manages to retain that innocence and purity through some very difficult times. As a Viet Nam veteran, and a college graduate of the late Sixties, I could of course personally relate to the various periods that Forrest Gump endures. I would only mention that the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and period costume was enthralling. And yet it was so perfectly understated that Forrest Gump's travels through thirty five years of the stormiest and most meaningful years of American history only became clearly defined for the viewer. Even more so than the well known chocolates quote as a metaphor for life, I felt that the remark that stupid is what you do is probably more workable for most of us.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Pure Charm,"Every once in a while, something comes along that hasn't been done before. This movie is one of those things. First of all, we have a principal character whose take on life is one where you don't judge it; you live it. I know he's a film character. It doesn't matter because we use images such as these to inspire us and to give us our own way of treating each day. Forrest lets no grass grow under his feet. He is the consummate optimist. He doesn't complain because he sees early on that it does you no good. His life is one adventure after another, in and out of the public eye, but his shyness and demeanor don't ever get to his head. He is the epitome of patience, something sadly lacking in the lives of most Americans. He is pushed around by the gusts of time and always lands on his feet. His relationship with a troubled girl is the one consistent thing in his life, and that is also shows his pugnaciousness. There are some commentators and reviewers who call this character stupid. He is a slow processor, but his stability lies in his morality and his consistency. His mother raised him well.Tom Hanks has become our new Jimmy Stewart. His roles are about human emotion and dedication. He is the everyman in many ways. Obviously, the subject matter has changed, but you can bank on his decision making when it comes to film.The other heroes are the special effects people. They are able to make this work; to create an incredible world for him to function within. The news clips are quite marvelous. I usually put this film in my top ten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Dropping My Keys,"I remember John Byner, the stand-up comic and impressionist of the 1970s talking about guys crying at movies, how it's not an acceptable behavior. He advised the men in his audience to drop their keys, do something that gets them to lean forward, wipe their faces, and get things under control.I dropped my keys watching Forrest Gump. Lieutenant Dan comes over the hill at Forrest and Jenny's wedding, new legs, fiancé at his side, clean-cut and happy.Forrest states the obvious, ""Lieutenant Dan, you gawt le-eggs!""And the water-works just started to flow.I sit up straight and clear my throat. Got 'em (the keys, that is). My wife leans over and gives me a kiss. She says, ""That's why I love you.""Other than a few historical fussinesses and plot slickeries, none of which are worth mentioning, this is as close to a perfect, emotionally-satisfying entertainment as I have ever seen.I love this movie. I never tire of the simple story of the guy with the lowest IQ in the room being the smartest guy in the room. It's filled with a patriotic decency you can only find in The Wizard of Oz and To Kill a Mockingbird.When Dorothy is aching for home and the Wizard can't deliver, I drop my keys. When Scout points to the man behind Jem's bedroom door and says, ""Hey, Boo,"" the fob goes flying.The next time I get out my copy to show to my 11th Grade US History kids, I'll start fingering my key chain.I can't help it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Forrest Gump is a movie masterpiece that won't be forgotten and will continue to inspire,"He may have been good in Philadelphia but be is excellent in Forrest Gump.Tom Hanks delivers another great performance in his career by portraying the lovable,king yet not so intelligent character Forrest Gump.It is also Tom Hanks' second straight win for the Best Actor Oscar which he becomes the second man to do said accomplishment after Spencer Tracy.Whilst not as dramatic as Philadelphia,Tom Hanks' performance is just as great in this movie and this movie could possibly be the film of Tom Hanks' career as he used to be a comedy guy who turned to drama in a way which would paved for future stars such as Jim Carrey(The Truman Show),Reese Witherspoon(Walk the Line) and Will Ferrell(Stranger Than Fiction) to name a few.Also staring in this great movie classic are Robin Wright-Penn who plays Jenny,Gary Sinise who was nominated for an Academy Award for his portrayal of Lieutenant Dan Taylor,Mykelti Williamson as Forrest's best friend and shrimper Benjamin Buford""Bubba"" Blue and Sally Field as Mrs.Gump.This film was nominated for a total of thirteen Academy Awards but won six of them which include Best Film Editing,Best Visual Effects,Best Adapted Screenplay,Best Picture,Best Director-Robert Zemeckis and Best Actor-Tom Hanks.This is one masterpiece of a movie that will not be forgotten about in a long time.Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Tom Hanks' best performance,"This awesome movie is about an innocent man who represents how the world should be: he's loyal, humble, honest, he would never cheat or lie. He does everything with good heart and reaches success at the most important tasks of life.Only in America he could live such an interesting life: meet Elvis Presley, President Kennedy, John Lennon... He goes to Vietnam's war and he does everything following his heart. He becomes an American hero.Gary Sinise is a great American actor in his best performance too. He served in Vietnam with Forrest and was also a hero, protecting his men and fighting for his country.All in all this is a must-see movie for everyone, specially for non-Americans, so we can enjoy American culture and icons, as well as learn some American history, which is very useful.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Neither as good or as bad...,"People seem of two minds about this film: it either moves them to tears or to nausea.  But in reality, it is a well-made film with some strong performances but not more than that.  The core of this movie that is as simple minded as the title character; the facile speciousness of the movie's reactionary attacks on matters I agreed with made me realize just how shallow the movie's entire argument is.But beyond that, the movie is very well made; Hanks's performance could have been annoying in other hands but works well here.  Sinise was excellent as well.  Robin Wright's performance was adequate - I try not to blame her for the movie's implied argument that the social movements of the 60's and 70's were a working out of childhood neuroses - but never really stuck to me. The technical aspects of the film are outstanding, and the movie has a lot of laughs and tears despite its empty headed core.If it helps anyone, this is my wife's favorite movie.

The role of innocence in positive thinking and thus success ...,"... seems to be the theme of this film. Forrest Gump has an IQ of 70, is being raised by a single mom, lives in a remote part of the Deep South where there are few opportunities, and has legs that require that he wear braces as a child. Sounds like the recipe for a sad tale or at least a slow death from mediocrity right? No, instead, because Forrest isn't really bright enough to realize the situation he is in, he simply does what he's told to do or what occurs to him to be the right thing at the time and succeeds due to a lack of self doubt. He's told to run and he becomes the star of the Crimson Tide and an All American. When recovering from a war wound, he's taught ping-pong and winds up competing at the global level in China itself. He promises his dying friend Bubba that he'll go ahead with their plans and become a shrimp boat captain and his brand of seafood products becomes a household name.All along the way he never learns the lessons in life that tend to make the rest of us cynical.Gump's childhood sweetheart Jenny starts out with high aspirations - she wants to be like Joan Baez and fight for world peace - and instead she winds up disillusioned, drug addicted, and a near suicide before age 30. She doesn't have Forrest's childlike innocence and this leads her to self-doubt and ultimately failure. Also, fate or ""destiny"" as the film calls it, is not on her side in one big way - her own father molested her as a child, which couldn't help but play a role in the decisions she made.Now Gump does have a bunch of coincidences on his side - call it destiny if you will - the storm that beaches every shrimping vessel in the Gulf of Mexico but his, for example - but in most cases this is just the story of a man going through life without self doubt and that little voice that tells the rest of us ""You can't do that! What are the odds! You'll fail! Make the safe choice!"" To me, this is what this film is about. I think everyone sees something different in it. I highly recommend it as it is truly one of a kind. I remember when it came out it absolutely made professional reviewers crazy that people liked this film, probably because they didn't understand it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Quite possibly the best movie ever made.,"I've seen most of the top-voted 30 or 40 movies here at IMDb, and Forrest Gump probably wins my vote for the single best movie ever made.This is not a conclusion I came to the first time I saw this film, or the second. The more you understand about this movie, the more you like it. And in terms of understanding it, my wife and I both were still gaining new understanding the 5th or 6th time we watched it. (For example: Why does Jenny behave exactly as she does throughout the movie? It'll take a lot of thinking to =fully= understand her.)Just the fact that we've seen it at least half a dozen times says a lot. There are few movies that I ever even give a second viewing.Like many of the truly good movies, there are people out there who see it once and consider it to be a waste of time. Such people are usually just looking for the most ""action,"" gore and sex they can find, and haven't a clue about films that actually involve thought, ideas, and life.Did I mention the script is absolutely brilliant? There are a lot of =truly= funny moments. And the music rocks. But those are only specific aspects of a movie that has just about everything else right about it as well.See it, enjoy it, think about it, see it again. Think about it some more.

Mama said ...,"Take this with a grain of salt and don't be mad about certain things. Like one of the first flashbacks to the very beginning that does not come over preachy when it talks about the Klan (Ku Klux Klan that is, just in case you think I'm talking about any other Klan). Maybe sometime in the near future there will be a disclaimer and someone giving this context. But until then, you have to be educated enough yourself to understand and comprehend certain things. And you have to have a certain sense of humor to dig all the coincidences that Gump comes across at. It's alike a marathon through many landmarks of the short US history we have behind us. Like the Watergate scandal, Vietnam War, Black Panthers and so much more.If you can dig all that and go with the flow, than the chocolate box this opens up for you, will taste quite delicious.

Good if you're looking for something to set your teeth on edge,"The other nominees for Best Picture of 1994 were `Pulp Fiction', `Four Weddings and a Funeral', `The Shawshank Redemption' and `Quiz Show'.  ANY ONE of these would have been a deserving winner (my personal favourite was probably `Quiz Show').  Yet, of course, the award went to `Forrest Gump'.  I took this as a deep personal affront.  I took every undeserved success and wreath of flowers laid at the door of this miserable film as a personal affront.  It was a standing insult to my belief that `Forrest Gump' was just too stupid to succeed for very long.  Ah, well.  Life imitates art.Make no mistake: `Forrest Gump' is not just stupid but a hymn to stupidity, an extended celebration of stupidity as a virtue.  Gump is as innocent as they come and we're clearly meant to think that this is a good thing.  The trouble is that Gump has purchased his sainthood too cheaply.  He does not, for instance, display any real courage in the Vietnam War: he gives the appearance of courage only because he's too dumb to work out what's going on.  (If only a bomb had landed on his foot.  It would have knocked some of that insufferable self-assurance out of him, at the very least.)The film is just one big, long appeal to the Pope to have Forrest Gump canonised, and is about as bearable as any such appeal - and, as is so often the case, the subject of this appeal is someone you wouldn't want to spend five minutes with.`Forrest Gump' is one hundred and forty-two minutes long.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Hand Of An Unseen Providence,"When Tom Hanks won his first Oscar for Philadelphia in 1993 the film received a total of five nominations. His second Oscar for Forrest Gump came in a film that received more than double that in nominations and awards. If Forrest Gump did nothing else it solidified Hanks's credentials as a serious actor. He would never be doing imitations of his Bosom Buddies character in films again.It also among other awards also won for Best Picture and Best director for Robert Zemeckis, richly deserved. The film is Huckleberry Finn like in its canny observations coming from the man who had an IQ we are told of 75. But as Forrest also tells us, ""stupid is as stupid does"". And Forrest with the hand of an unseen providence comes out a lot better than some of the clever people he meets in life.Watching the film once again it occurred to me that Mark Twain if he couldn't have written this himself would have loved the way Zemeckis handled the character of Forrest Gump. The beauty of Huckleberry Finn and the secret of its success is that Twain got into the mind of a child who recorded all the events around him, a child without too much education. What Zemeckis did was get Hanks into a child like mind who sees things with amazing clarity stripped of any veneer of pretense. Which Hanks observes in the people around him and in the events that shape America and himself from Eisenhower to Reagan.There are two prominent female parts in Forrest Gump. One is for Robin Wright who plays the abused child Julie as an adult. She is Forrest's love and best friend and she takes a different path of life one she chose with more deliberation than Hanks. Their fates though eventually entwined are radically different.The second major female role is for another two time Oscar winner Sally Field who now is playing matronly parts, a far cry from Gidget and the Flying Nun. She gives Forrest the maxims he lives by and in a crisis they turn out to be more than sound bite clichés.Another award that Forrest Gump won is for Special Effects and an award it didn't win was for Gary Sinise in the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, Forrest's commanding officer in Vietnam. That's something that does not compute because the special effects were to show Gary Sinise as a double amputee with both legs lost in Vietnam.It's some amazing bit of work no doubt about it, but to honor it without Sinise whose performance really brings it off is ridiculous. Sinise is the educated one who curses the fate that happened to him, but in the end by just going with the flow he does prosper in the end. Sinise lost that year in Best Supporting Actor category to Martin Landau for Ed Wood, but I think Sinise's performance has had a more lasting impact.To those Americans who serve our country it certainly has. Gary Sinise has devoted a great deal of his life and earned treasure to bring entertainment to our overseas troops in Iraq, Afghanistan, wherever, becoming a successor to Bob Hope in that regard. He's gone further than that though, setting up foundations to help civilians in both countries and contributing to numerous charities dealing with war and its aftermath. Doing that in my humble opinion Gary Sinise has become one of the great Americans of our brand new millenia, a lot more than just an actor. He's forever now known as Lieutenant Dan.In the end though the film belongs to Tom Hanks who joined with Spencer Tracy as the only two male actors to win back to back Oscars for Best Actor. Hanks fascinates us and guides us through this film and when we're done we've seen something very special.If you don't believe me about how good Forrest Gump is, then watch it for a few minutes and see if you're not sucked in. Like Forrest's mama says, the film's like life which is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you'll get until you open it.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"After 20 years, I still love Forrest Gump!","When I originally watched this with my mom 20 years ago, we both were pretty touched by the events of Forrest Gump's life and the way he handled things. So now, watching this in IMAX with my movie theatre-working friend, it's the same feelings all over again but now having some additional life experiences, one notices things one hadn't thought of before. Like how the first person who sits with Forrest on the park bench is so uninterested in his story she takes the wrong bus and admits it to him while the last one who sits with him doesn't take her scheduled one because she's so immersed in hearing about his life! Or how Jenny realizes how much she truly loves him despite the way she sometimes treated him. Robert Zemeckis truly made a very compelling picture. And Tom Hanks delivered a wonderful performance worthy of a second Oscar win. Nice humorous stuff involving Hanks mixed in real news footage of the various presidents. And great music soundtrack to mark the times they lived in. Oh, and I loved the supporting cast of Mykelti Williamson, Sally Field, Gary Sinise, and Robin Wright as Jenny.

"Forrest has ""gumption""!","Gumption: noun; common sense, horse sense, initiative, enterprise (Merriam-Webster). Chop off the back half of that word and you have Forrest Gump, a towering fountain of stand-alone common sense in a nonsensical world gone crazy.In a recent letter, a friend told me that she had just watched ""Forrest Gump"" and that she ""loved that movie."" Although it had been some seven years since I had seen it, her comment to me reminded me that I, too, had once ""loved that movie."" When it suddenly showed up on TV last night, I felt the urge, the need, for a refresher course on what it is like to be a Forrest Gump in a world of schlumps, myself included. Moreover, I needed the sanity and serenity of Forrest Gump the man to assuage the insanity and unserenity that has been the month of September of 2001. I have been assuaged.By now, almost anyone who watches movies has seen ""Forrest Gump."" At least once. Thus, we all know that it cannot be classified as a comedy. Nor as a drama. Nor an adventure. Nor a charmer. Nor a tearjerker. And yet, it is all of those things, all in one movie. ""Forrest Gump,"" when and as you are watching it, reminds you constantly that there IS good in the world. Even as you are watching bad events transpire in the movie, you seem to know that somehow, good will eventually result. That is because Forrest Gump is nearby -- around -- somewhere -- and wherever Forrest goes, goodness follows.My favorite movie actor is, was and always will be Jimmy Stewart. With Jimmy gone and no longer with us, Tom Hanks has taken his place. In my heart. Just as Jimmy was in so very many of his famous and fabulous roles, Tom has become the American Everyman. He's the guy for whom you always root. You want him to triumph. You want him to get the girl. He HAS to get the girl! Even if the worth of the girl to be gotten is open to question, you STILL want him to get her, if only because he has always loved her and will always love her so unfailingly and so unconditionally. And when, at last, his unrequited love for his beloved Jenny (Robin Wright) is finally so deservedly rewarded, you feel as if you want to jump up and shout ... ""HALLELUJAH!!!"" Then, when Jenny tenderly tells Forrest that he is the father of her sweet little Forrest Jr., you think to yourself and you say to yourself, ""Yes, Self! That is right! That is as it should be!""And that is right and that is as it should be about this entire movie. Even Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), Forrest's self-loathing and loathable army buddy, is unable to avoid Forrest's goodness wearing off on him. Forrest ""touches"" everyone. And he doesn't even know it! He's just a guy living his life. He just ... is ... Forrest Gump, a guy with gumption in a gumptionless world.I am so very glad and happy that my friend told me she saw ""Forrest Gump"" and that she ""loved that movie."" She spurred me to watch it once again. Having now done so, I feel that Forrest has restored both peace and love to my troubled mind and heart over the awful events of September of 2001. He is a reminder to us all that no matter how many Hitlers, Stalins and bin Ladens may rise and fall, we will always have a Forrest Gump to help pull us thru the evils that these evil men do.

"Forrest, Forrest Gump.. The greatest.","There is an unfortunate time when you watch this film, its not the film thats the problem its my highly evident fear of the next few films I watch just seeming so bad. For simply not being this. Its everything. Its a romantic-comedy-tragedy-life-story-historical-personal- uplifting-war story. Every time I watch it I go on an emotional journey with the characters that are quickly built up in the world around Forrest. There is not much more I can say about this film that will say how much i like it, apart from award it the accolade that is; My favourite film. Over time the film stands up, the performances seem to get better knowing how Hanks has gone on to be a great actor. His supporting cast do a great job of making the world of the film feel believable.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"I liked it, but I did not love it","I get why so many people gush over this movie, I really do. I have watched it quite a few times myself. It is good to kill a few hours and be entertained. It ain't great though. The overwhelming emotion I feel for Forrest is pity, as he is strung along and used by the object of his affections. This is a decent movie, perhaps one of the best from Mr. Hanks, but I do not feel it deserves as much hype as it gets.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
How is Gump ageing?,"I recently saw this film again and was interested to see whether it had improved with time or I had mellowed in my opinion of it. Not a chance! The film looks even more tritely prelapsarian than ever. Basically the film is an unashamedly reactionary piece of brain candy floss, sickly and insubstantial.In this films universe Simplicity = Good Social change = Bad. Agents of social change = very bad and therefore they must contract AIDS. If it wasn't so nauseating it would be funny.Unfortunately, the Academy took it seriously and it picked up Oscars, when they should have booed it off the screen. Cynically sickly and morally bankrupt its a disgrace.Incidentally Jamie Russell in his book ""Vietnam War Movies"" wrote; ""Forrest Gump is Hollywood at its most horrendous...Whats most worrying is that the British Board of Film Classification saw fit to give this evil little film a U certificate.

The Ultimate Fad Movie,"""Forrest Gump"" is the ultimate fad movie. It came out big in 1994 and created a cultural sensation. It was easy to get swept up in its panorama of American cultural history, and all of the iconic imagery in the film made it seem like it was saying something important. But all these years later, this treacly piece of rubbish is nearly intolerable.The film is full of easy sentiment and false emotion. It depicts one thing after another (the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, Watergate, the AIDS crisis) that trigger automatic emotional responses in the audience, so that the filmmakers don't have to do any work of their own to make the material effective. But underneath the lesson in American history and the admittedly terrific soundtrack, I can't help but wonder what point the movie tries to make. Are we to applaud Forrest for his pluck and resiliency when the only reason for them is the fact that he's too simple minded to understand the things that happen to him? Are we supposed to emulate him? Is the message that we all make life too complicated, and that we all need to buckle down to the only things that really matter, like love of country, God and our dear ol' mama? If so, gag.Tom Hanks is a winning presence in the film, and if anyone was going to be able to carry this story along, I imagine he did just as good a job as anyone else would have. But the only character worth watching as far as I'm concerned is poor little Jenny, played valiantly by Robin Wright Penn, who comes closer than anyone to playing an actual human being, despite the film's tendency to chew her character up and spit her out.This movie is like a box of chocolates...too much of it and you'll be sick.Grade: C-",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Forrest Gump: Simply a Masterpiece!,"If there's one movie that's both ridiculously funny and heartbreakingly emotional at the same time, it's Forrest Gump. It's the kind of film that makes you feel like you've lived an entire life by the time the credits roll.Tom Hanks absolutely nails it as Forrest, this sweet, simple guy who somehow ends up at the center of all these huge historical events without even trying. He's not a genius, but his pure heart and honest outlook on life make him way more relatable than most heroes in movies. You can't help but love him.The story is wild but in the best way. Forrest just goes from one crazy adventure to another-meeting presidents, starting a shrimp business, and even inspiring Elvis! Somehow, it all works. The way they blend real historical footage into the scenes is super clever, and it keeps the movie feeling fresh even now.What really sticks, though, is the heart of the movie. It's about love, loss, and figuring out how to keep going when life throws curveballs your way. The way Forrest talks about Jenny, his mom, and even his friend Bubba? It's just... pure. No fluff, no overcomplicated drama-just genuine love.And let's not forget the music. The soundtrack is chef's kiss. Every song just fits so perfectly, pulling you right into the time periods Forrest's living through.If you're looking for a movie that's funny, touching, and just plain unforgettable, this is it. Forrest Gump isn't just a movie-it's an experience. Trust me, you'll walk away with a smile (and maybe a few tears).",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Numersous Secrets to Success are Shown in ""Forrest Gump""","YEAR OF RELEASE: 1994 WRITERS: Winston Groom (novel) and Eric Roth (screenplay) DIRECTOR: Robert Zemeckis RUNTIME: 2 hours 22 minutesI haven't seen this film for about 7 years or so. Seeing it again I was reminded why this is one of my all-time favorite pictures.THE PLOT: Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump, a mildly retarded Alabaman who brushes shoulders with the key figures and events of the 50s through the early 80s. Due to hard work, focus and uncommon wisdom he is hugely successful at whatever he does (running, war hero, ping pong, shrimp fishing). Meanwhile, the one woman he loves in all the world, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), flounders through life hopelessly trying to find fulfillment in the drug culture with all the wrong people.""Forrest Gump"" is hugely entertaining on every level. It's a drama that skillfully includes both lighter, comedic moments and serious, tragic elements. If you've never seen it, don't think for a second that this is some average romantic comedy or goofball comedy. Far from it. I don't watch the Acadamy Awards or give any credence to their judgment (""American Beauty,"" best picture? Please) but ""Forrest Gump"" is one instance where they were absolutely right in regard to the Best Picture award.Some have criticized the film as an imbecilic fantasy, arguing that a simpleton like Gump would never become successful. It's true that the picture exaggerates Forrest's successes and experiences, and in that sense it's not realistic, but the film plainly reveals WHY he experienced continued success throughout his life. We can all learn from these little gems of wisdom:-- Whatever your I.Q., zero in on the areas for which you have a real talent.-- Focus on those gifts and master them. In other words, don't be a jack of all trades. This is in line with the Russian proverb: ""If you chase 8 rabbits you'll catch none.""-- Mastering your talents will take HARD WORK (which explains why lazy people are never wealthy, unless they inherit it).-- Whatever you do, do it WITH ALL YOUR HEART.-- Love deeply and cultivate deep loyalties (e.g. Jenny, Bubba & Lt. Dan). Loyalty is underrated.-- Be patient and slow to judge (unless someone abuses another person).-- Allow others the freedom to choose and make mistakes, even if it seems like it takes forever for them to learn from them.-- If something or someone STINKS, reject it and stay away from it (remember the prostitute?).-- Keep your word.-- Pray and have FAITH.-- Keep a humble spirit no matter how successful or great you become.We can also learn lessons from Jenny: Trying to attain fulfillment through loose sex and foreign substances is a LOST cause. Recognize and embrace those who have your best interests in mind (i.e. those who truly love you and are loyal to you); stay away from people who use and abuse you.From Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise) we learn a potent lesson about struggling with God to find true peace, success and reconciliation. Dan's all-out fight with God on the shrimp boat in the storm is potent and REAL. The great men and women of the bible experienced intense struggles with God: Most of the book of Job shows Job arguing with the Almighty and wanting to put Him on trial for crimes against humanity (!!); When God finally answers him Job falls to his face in humility and reverence. Jacob fought with God all night; the next day the Lord changed his name to Israel, which means ""struggles with God"" (Genesis 32:22-30). Also, remember Jesus' struggle with God and His will in the Garden of Gethsemane?Another thing we can learn from Lt. Dan is that he was able to recognize a ""golden connection"" in Forrest. No one makes it alone, no one. They had help. Despite Forrest's lack of academic smarts, Dan recognized his wisdom and greatness; it attracted him and he respected it. Because of his link to Gump he became hugely successful. Remember: ""One day of favor is worth a lifetime of labor.""Late in the film you'll see Lt. Dan and his Asian fiancé at Gump's wedding. Note how Dan LOOKS at Forrest when they greet each other. Dan shows the utmost love and respect for Gump and is in utter awe of his simple-minded greatness. (This is great acting on Sinise's part).""Forrest Gump"" is a film gem to be RELISHED on many levels. Not only will you be incredibly entertained, you may learn a thing or two.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A Heartwarming Rendition Of Love, Loss, Redemption & Stupidity.","Winner of 6 Academy Awards including Best Picture in the year that had heavyweights such as Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Frank Darabont's The Shawshank Redemption & Disney's The Lion King, Forrest Gump isn't as impressive as the above-mentioned classics but its optimistic take on the unpredictability of life, stability between its genre elements, and a charismatic performance from Tom Hanks turns it into a cinema that's as heartwarming as it is amusing.Based on the novel of the same name, Forrest Gump tells the story of its titular character, a simple-minded, kind-hearted & good-natured guy from Alabama whose life turns out to be a wicked blend of luck & destiny as he steers through as well as influences some of the historic moments of the second half of 20th century America. However, despite accomplishing great things in life, what he covets most is the love of the woman he grew up with, who never reciprocates his feelings.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, Forrest Gump is a series of brief episodes stitched into one wonderfully layered tapestry and is expertly narrated from start to finish. There are a few hiccups in between but it is a smooth adventurous ride for the most part. Eric Roth's screenplay takes liberty with the source material but what's admirable about it is its relentless focus on the central character. It does allow its supporting characters to breathe but none of them have an arc that's compelling enough.Production design team does a stellar job in recreating the time-specific surroundings. Visual effects is extensively applied throughout the story plus its tinkering with the archival footages of some of United States' most significant events of the later half of the 20th century was a VFX feat of its time. There aren't any glaring issues with its camera-work. Editing fails to give it a tightly- knitted structure, while the background score & incorporated songs are in sync with the unfolding events & depicted timeline.Coming to the performances, Forrest Gump features a dependable cast in Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson & Sally Field, and although everyone does well in their given roles, the film is powered by Hanks' outstanding performance. Fresh off his Oscar-winning role in Philadelphia, Hanks chips in with another smashing work and is the soul of this tale. And he's well supported by Sinise & Field who play Forrest's platoon leader & mother respectively while Wright ably portrays the self-destructive life of his love interest, Jenny.On an overall scale, Forrest Gump often gets a lot of flak for stripping both Pulp Fiction & The Shawshank Redemption off their deserving accolades but it does have a heart & identity of its own. I wasn't very impressed by it during my first viewing but it has managed to grow on me over the years and now I do admire its positive outlook on life & the numerous mysteries it has in store. A delightful comedy, an emotionally resonant drama & nicely covering the themes of love, loss, redemption & stupidity, Forrest Gump is one of the best films of its year. Definitely recommended.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
I used to love this movie.,"*** Momma used to say if you haven't seen this movie, skip the second paragraph, 'cause it's got some of 'dem magic spoilers ***Maybe my inner cynic finally got to me. I've seen ""Forrest Gump"" about seven or eight times altogether, and these last few viewing experiences left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.A few years ago I praised this film for being delightful, warm, inspiring, epic, etc. It was one of my top-ten favorite films. I loved it.I watched it again last night and was struck by how smug, contrived and self-conscious it is. It's almost sickeningly sweet - it's a fantasy (as I've always said) and all the characters live their lives to suit the story. I loved the poetic justice before - now it's kind of insulting.The character of Jenny is, story-wise, a nice addition because all fairy tales have the hero and his girl. The setup is firm because it presents her as the only girl of Forrest's life, the one person who accepts him for who he is - as she grows up and changes he's always there for her. The ending is a nice full circle. But the fact that the film kills her off is too righteous. It's like, ""Hey, she did the sex, she did the drugs - SHE DIES! Who cares if she had a change of heart? She's a filthy skank!"" Forrest's ""Momma"" is a right-wing Christian fanatical who has an obsessive hold over Forrest. She's a bit like the mother in ""Bubble Boy,"" except in this films she's presented as a hero.And finally we come to Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump. Last year I thought it was one of the all-time best performances in any film. Now, I can barely stand listening to him.It's all so smug and annoyingly sweet. ""Would you like a choc'-uh-lut?"" You feel like slapping the guy. Then taking his darn ""walkin' shoes"" and throwing them in a pool of gasoline and lighting them on fire. Along with his box of chocolates.Forrest's smug attitude is a bit too self-knowing for my tastes. It's like he's saying a big screw-you to all the people who disagree. He's Uncle Sam's Favorite American - the dumb guy who was too stoo-pid to say no to the government, and in return was awarded with millions of dollars and a happy, content life. All the Vietnam protesters were pigs, praise America.As far as ""retard"" characters go, Dustin Hoffman is still my favorite. Leonardo DiCaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" is really good, too. But Hanks' performance is just a bit too self-confident and mugging - it's too damn innocent and naive.As I said, this used to be one of my very favorite movies. I loved it. It used to move me to tears at times. (Well, almost, anyway.) But I guess I've given my inner cynic too much room to grow - now I see it as a smug, annoying little journey through America's pop culture - with a message at its core that says, ""Don't mess with America - or you'll get the Gump."" America has enough blind love going already.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Mention must be made of the two actors who portray Young Forrest and Young Jenny who also put in a good performance (although Hanna R.

Tale worthy of Frank Capra,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a simple man with a sweet heart. It's his journey through American history. His childhood friend Jenny (Robin Wright) would travel the underbelly flipside of the same world. His journey is heavily influenced by his mama (Sally Field), Lieutenant Dan (Gary Sinise), and Bubba Blue (Mykelti Williamson).Director Robert Zemeckis has added another chapter to the American mythos. It is a magical tale where the good guys win out. That you can rise to the top no matter what handicap you have. That a good heart will enlighten all it touches. It is a tale worthy of Frank Capra.If I could have a wish, it is a deeper meaning to Gump's journey. For example, he's given a chance to comment on the Vietnam war but the sound goes out of his mike.

"Like the chocolate in a box, my feelings are mixed....","(r#79)I would lie if I said that Forrest Gump isn't an extremely well made movie. From the acting, to the feel-good story, to the pacing, comic timing, and fantastic soundtrack, it is one of the best movies ever made. Tom Hanks is good as the titular character, and Gary Sinise and Robin Wright Penn make for a strong supporting cast. Robert Zemeckis' direction hits all the right notes. The movie is also visually beautiful. So why did I only give it a 7 out of 10? Well, as well produced, directed and acted as the film is, there is an underlying cynicism that doesn't work well with the movie's innocent and good-hearted nature. The ""heart-breaking"" scenes become more and more obvious and deliberate with each viewing. Don't get me wrong, this is a great feel-good story and I did love it when I was younger. Maybe I am just growing more desensitized to this kind of warm-hearted, mushy stuff. The problem probably lies more with me than with the film itself, but I still can't help but feel that Zemeckis was a bit too elaborate. There are scenes that, when you're re-watching the film, seem written specifically to make the audience crack up in tears. It borders on being manipulative, rather than letting the audience think for itself.The movie could have worked as a serious drama. I'm a sucker for movies about mentally challenged men and I loved both ""Sling Blade"" and the more obscure ""Den Enfaldige Mördaren"". In the former, Billy Bob Thornton delivered a total class act. He embodied his character, Karl, to the point where you couldn't possibly compare him to his role in, say, Bad Santa. In ""Den Enfaldige Mördaren"", Stellan Skarsgård was also utterly believable. But I just can't buy Hanks in this role, even if it's probably the one he'll be remembered for. Thornton and Skarsgård, in their respective roles, *were* their characters. They were as human and real as you and me. Hanks' performance is a pure live-action cartoon, a caricature of a mentally challenged man. He's just too goody-goody. Too pure of heart. Too goofy and lovable. He's a man with no dark sides, and as such he's completely unbelievable. I did laugh at Gump's cute lines and catchphrases. I did feel for him when he got bullied around and when he finally got the girl in the end. But I wonder if anyone actually bought Gump as a character rather than just ""Tom Hanks playing a mentally challenged guy"".Another problem is that the movie refuses to take any real risks. There is nothing controversial about the subject matter and nothing really inventive about the movie-making (although it is quite an achievement to fit an entire lifetime into a single film!) 'Gump' is not a movie that pushes the envelope in any way.This is still a very enjoyable movie and first-timers will probably love it. It took a lot of viewings for me before my strong feelings for it started to falter. On the surface, ""Gump"" is one of the best feel-good movies ever made. But if you read between the lines, it is a cynical and very elaborate movie, nearly manipulative, and specifically designed to make you laugh, cry and pay for repeated cinema viewings. At least Hanks and Sinise do their best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A thoroughly nasty piece of work,"This film clearly falls into the Love/Hate category. I think it's one where either you like the principle idea of optimism or you detest the idea that life is simply handed to you and all you have to do is throw it away.I for one hated this film. Not for the acting, which I didn't rate very highly, although Sinise put in a good performance in my view, I'm even a fan of Hanks other work but didn't particularly enjoy his performance here. No, I hated this film for its message which I found to be so central and pervasive that I couldn't enjoy any of the rest of the film's supposed qualities. The message I got from this film was that it makes no difference what you do in life, no matter how hard you work, how talented you are or how much you believe, if you just let life go past you, obey and be good then you will be a huge success. It's a belief I see more and more and one which I find abhorrent.Strangely enough it seems that this belief is becoming true. Make an average film with average acting and you too can have a huge box office success and win multiple Oscars.Perhaps this is then a truly brilliant and ironic piece of work.

"""Bye Bye Jenny. They sendin' me to Vietnam. It's this whole other country.""","I loved this movie. I don't care what people say. either you loved this movie or hated it. I loved it. I thought it was the second best film of 1994, and in the top ten best films of the 90's. It's one of my favorite movies. Tom Hanks gave a great, if not his best performance in Forrest Gump (it's either this, 'Saving Private Ryan', or 'Big').Robin Wright and Sally Field gave outstanding to Tam Hanks, but I thought that the performance to match with Tom Hanks' was Gary Sinise. This is his best performance (next to 'Of Mice and Men'). His character, Lieutenant Dan, is the most tragic as he goes from being a proud platoon leader in Vietnam to a faithless, surly man who is confined to a wheelchair, who blames Forrest for his legs. One of the most moving scenes is when he is on the shrimp boat with Forrest, thanks him for saving his life, and swims into the sunlight, where he makes his peace with God.Many people didn't like this movie because of the hype, or the lewdness (I've heard people complain of it before), or the story itself, but on any account, I loved this movie. It is very sad, funny, exciting, and heart warming. Robert Zemeckis did a great job with the direction. I think my favorite part was either the running scenes or the shrimp boat scenes.

One of the best of the 90's,"I have seen Forrest Gump about 15 times, and every time it drives me to tears. It shows how a man who is not exactly ""right"" can be very successful and lead a full life. I hear people all the time criticize this movie, but why? How can't you love this movie? Forrest is so likeable and the filmmakers even succeed in making some humorous parts which is not normal in most dramas.

Uplifting & Wondrous Fable.,"Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump in Robert Zemekis's Academy Award winning(Best picture, director, & actor) fable about a simple and honest man who finds himself floating through life like(the ever-present) feather in the wind. He is often bullied growing up, but finds solace in his best friend Jenny, whom he comes to love dearly as they get older. She tells him to ""run Forrest, run"" and he does, and one day runs into a football game, inspiring the coach to put him on the team, which makes him more popular, though at graduation he joins the military, where he fits right in, much to the bewilderment of his superior officer, Lt. Dan(played by Gary Sinise) whose life he saves, giving him a medal and inspiring him to be a Ping-Pong champion, where he meets three different U.S. Presidents, and later becomes a multi-millionaire by investing in ""a fruit company"" that takes off in a big way. He loves his mother(played by Sally Field) and takes her departure quite hard, running a marathon across the country for years, until he meets up with the elusive Jenny once again...Epic-scale character study is supremely well crafted and acted, remaining a funny, moving, and inspired drama about how one good man can affect the world around him, and still not know it, and remain uncorrupted by it. A truly marvelous achievement by all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The reason IMDb needs to introduce the zero rating,"Not being Tom Hanks' greatest fan, I avoided watching this film for several months after its release. This also gave me time for the hype to die down a little - but on the back of all the press and several positive comments I was still expecting to sit down to enjoy a good movie.I was mistaken. My reward? Two hours of praying for the credits to roll to take away the pain.To me this movie takes pleasure in displaying everything that is wrong with the Hollywood film industry - America's need to rewrite history to suit its own needs, its desire to peddle the ""American dream"" myth and the rewards given blindly to any movie that does the above (in the form of several Oscars - could anyone please explain to me the exceptional qualities of the movie that put it above anything else released that year?If only Forrest had kept running... into the sea",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A magical and powerful celebration of life. A true classic.,"Every so often there are movies that seemingly get released right at the right time and subsequently become cultural phenomenons beyond their creators' wildest dreams. These movies often largely retain that success and esteem over the years (Gone with the Wind, Star Wars and Jaws among others) or age poorly and get viewed as undeserving of their huge success at the time (for instance, Independence Day). Although no movie appeals to absolutely everyone's taste, Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump certainly can be said to belong more in the former category. Released in 1994 it raked in nearly seven hundred million dollars worldwide, becoming the second biggest box office hit of '94 (after The Lion King) and mopped the floor at that year's Academy Awards, winning six trophies including Best Picture (although I prefer Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption by the tiniest of margins, but this isn't about those two), Director and Actor. It's a classic that, after first seeing it in 1997 when I was 9, has stayed with me to this day. I'm about to explain why.I don't think there's any need for me to talk about the story, so let me begin with the cast ensemble Zemeckis assembled for this film. Sally Field will always be Mrs. Gump to me, and she turns in a beautiful performance as a strong woman with integrity who vehemently refuses to think of her son as a retard and does her best to make sure he never sees himself as one. An Oscar-nominated Gary Sinise is riveting as the hard-bitten but scarred military man Lt. Dan who comes to learn from Forrest the values of redemption and selflessness. Robin Wright Penn is heartbreaking as Forrest's free-spirited but deeply troubled true love whose life takes a very different route to Forrest's, and Mykelti Williamson also gives a very touching turn as Bubba, the African-American young man with a heart of gold who becomes Forrest's best friend in Vietnam.But at the risk of sounding like a hyperbolic and dangerously obsessed fanboy, I daresay the acting masterclass Tom Hanks puts forth here is the finest display of acting I have ever witnessed. No other actor before or since has made such a convincing transformation into the heart, body and soul of another person as Hanks does here. Every delayed or confused mannerism is spot-on, his Southern accent is flawless and his every emotion letter-perfect. In the whole film, particularly the grave scene towards the end, you look into his eyes and you don't see Tom Hanks, you see Forrest Gump. Utter perfection.Many will say the storyline is a contrived, manipulative and even conservative affair (and, admittedly, in some respects they may be right), but they're oblivious to the darker subtext in Eric Roth's screenplay and the many postmodern storytelling methods Zemeckis deploys here. While we watch Forrest encounter so many historic people and events, we see Jenny experience the negative side of '60s and '70s counterculture as she protests the Vietnam War, embraces alcohol, drugs and illicit sex and also for much of the film's duration Forrest's impairments are exploited for laughs. When we analyze this side of the story the film becomes much darker than it initially seems. The unconventional methods Zemeckis uses in telling Forrest's story enhance this – in his narration he discusses things that are yet to happen and the placing of Tom Hanks into old footage of the real-life events gives the movie a revisionist historical feel.Another huge plus is the soundtrack, containing most of the greatest artists from the '50s to the early '80s.Forrest Gump's charm and appeal is timeless, and its artistic craft is even better. It's a rollicking tapestry of American history from the '50s to the '80s (both good and bad), driven by a powerhouse ensemble cast and a brilliant crew working on a brilliantly constructed screenplay filled with dozens of lines that have entered the lexicon, all brought together by the love and passion of a genius director. Forrest Gump is a classic that will look handsome in any DVD collection, and is yet another movie that never leaves me feeling amazed no matter how much older I get. A true classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
That's one special man...,"I think that the best movies are those that you 'appreciate' or understand after seeing it more than once. However, with 'forrest gump', i fell in love with it after the first 15 minutes and knew it would be in my top 10 straight away.It is so unique because of the character Forrest Gump himself, who has a low IQ of only 75. Although he is 'mentally challenged', he finds himself in historic and troublesome situations and like that he manages to 'forrest gump' his way out of it and end up a hero or role model. but the real beauty in this movie to me was his ability to simplify the complexities of the world we live in and somehow do what some war movies fail to do. show the importance of world peace or what love movies can't deliver...the importance of love.I love that Forrest doesn't lose his innocence and purity throughout the movie, or maybe he just can't but either way, this shows you don't need to be evil or really intelligent to be recognised or successful. Then again it is just a movie (and a very good one too). So maybe it doesn't work like that in reality. what that simply means is that the acting and story of this film was incredibly touching on a real level. And in my definition that's what a good movie should be able to do.Every award the movie received was well deserved especially Tom Hanks. Now that's an actor for ya. I love this movie and don't hesitate to give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Heart Warming,"This movie was amazing. It reminds me of my rises and falls in my life and just seeing how resilient Forrest Gump became was really inspiring. He had so much to offer the world, even when no one saw his ability to contribute to society. He did everything from leading a football team to a championship, to being a war hero. Even through the tough times in high school to the frantic relationship with Jenny, Forrest still remained humble and resilient. Any anti-bullying campaign, in my opinion, should use Forrest Gump as a prime example. Maybe even go as far as showing the movie. The movie also shows what it truly means to keep a promise. The promises that Forrest made to his mother, Bubba, Jenny and Lieutenant Dan were all kept. His love, passion, drive and spiritual understanding were all unconditional. What an amazing movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Forrest Gump,"The movie Forrest Gump is about a boy who suffers from mental retardation. He also suffers with scoliosis and has to wear knee braces. The movie tells a story about his life and his accomplishments. He suffers bullying from the people in town and the kids in school. He grows up and proves a lot of people wrong. The story takes place in a small town called Greensboro, Alabama. Tom Hanks portrays the character Forrest Gump. This movie won eight Oscars, one of them being Best Actor in Leading Role. Tom Hanks won the award in 1995. He did a very good job of showing Forrest Gump without mocking his disability. We meet Forrest's character at bus stop talking to people on the bench about his life accomplishments. After that, the story starts with Forrest' first day on the bus. This is when Forrest first experiences the other kids bullying. Until he meets young Jenny, who lets him sit beside her on the bus. Young Jenny is played by Hanna Hall. Jenny becomes his best friend and doesn't look at his disability as a difference. Forrest and Jenny grow up together and spend all their time together. Jenny has an abusive and drunk father. Older Jenny is played by Robin Wright. Forrest gets many opportunities, he is asked to play football in college. You also see many history events and how innocent Forrest's eyes are to the world. The movie is told in the 1970s, a lot of movements happened in the seventies. The movie shows both Forrest's experiences and Jenny's life, vastly different. Jenny went through the hippie movement, with drugs and peace. Overall the film Forrest Gump is a great movie. It's definitely a movie you could re watch and still enjoy it as much as the first time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The only one who deserved the Oscar lost, Gary Sinise. Finally, use cgi to work the retard into all the key TV/pop culture moments, guaranteed to melt a boomer's heart. Have him influence the whole world with his simple homespun Gomer Pyle platitudes. If the director had another 10 minutes to fill, Gump would have redesigned the Apollo space ship program and got the astronauts to the Moon. Enough sugar here to rot our whole country's teeth.

No one does it better than Tom Hanks.,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is sat on a bench waiting for a bus. He's hardly the most intelligent person in the world, but he's definitely the most caring, heart-warming and relatable character to ever appear in film. Gump tells his story to other bus-waiters who come and go and only hear snippets of the whole tale. The path towards present day is packed full of events and achievements, some of which include the Vietnam war, meeting the President (twice), unveiling the Watergate Scandal and running non- stop for over four years. Sounds ludicrous. Above all else Gump has accomplished feats that would occur over many lifetimes. Tom Hanks though, fills Gump's story with tenacity. He has an eventful life, one full of ups and downs. Very sad, but very humorous. A great film controlled by its lead man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

American history book + fairy tale for adults,"Of course I heard about this famous 'Run, Forrest, run!', and how Forrest Gump is the best of Hanks' acting career. However, I'm telling you this was not my kind of movie according to basic information provided. It has one narrative which happens to be biographical. My first thought is that 'Forrest Gump' will be another linear story talking about one character throughout the whole movie. Linear story lacks dynamic and bores me. Second, it is very AMERICAN, the stuff only hollywood clique will enjoy. I keep myself away from the literatures that emphasize patriotism too much.However, this movie does not bore me a bit for 150 minutes. Even though Gump narrates his whole life from the childhood to fatherhood, it feels more segmented. By cutting each chunk of life story and getting back to Gump in the bus station back and forth, it feels like the movie is giving the audience break after each session. I get to refresh and sum up at every scene of Gump at the bus stop. Also, supporting characters are unique and powerful, making the movie more dynamic. Rather than having many insignificant supporting characters, the director chooses to select and concentrate on three. Then, the audience can hear about the full story of Jenny, Bubba, and Lt. Dan, sharing the story with Gump.Even though there were many American historical moments, they were just necessary to develop along with Gump's story. AND it was funny to see Presidents and Elvis alive again with visual effects. Life lessons given to the audience are not just for Americans. Many countries go through conflict, turmoil, and destruction, and 'Forrest Gump' concentrates on what choice an individual, Gump, makes during those historical chaos. I cried a lot watching this movie because every character was me, my parents, my grandparents, my neighbor, and my heroes. Gump's warm heart really console me at difficult times.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Gets Better Every Time I Watch It,"When it comes to the greatest dramatic films ever produced, ""Forrest Gump"" has to be near the top of that list. Put succinctly, it has everything a movie could possible hold: adventure, great characters, drama, emotion, and humor. There are very few films that combine all those things with such aplomb as director Robert Zemeckis does with ""Gump"".For a very basic summary, this movie tells the story of Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), a man who, on the ""scale of normal"", falls a wee bit short in the intelligence department. However, via the guidance of his beloved Mama (Sally Field), the constant wanting for childhood sweetheart- turned-wild child Jenny (Robin Wright), and friends like Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) and Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), viewers are shown a life that, despite coming from such a simple mind, touches so many others.First and foremost, this is a movie that perfectly captures the angst of the Baby Boomers generation. Throughout the course of the film, everyone takes a stand on something and refuses to budge. Jenny is a hippie, Lt. Dan has a death wish, and even Mama Gump is okay with her boy selling out for U.S. ping-pong. The ultimate point made, however, is that such behavior cannot last forever and eventually one has to find their true self. That's exactly where Forrest comes in, as he never loses himself to begin with. Despite his simple mind, he ""knows what love is"" and shows it to everyone around him, even when they are using him for various reasons. In a swirling, turbulent world, Forrest is a bastion of self-awareness (ironic, as his awareness in other life areas is so low!).In order for all those things to work, it takes the acting performance of a lifetime--exactly what Hanks is able to give. There may never be a more deserved Best Actor Oscar given to anyone, as he perfectly nails both ""goofy simpleton"" and ""emotionally self-aware adult"", often in the the same scene. As many juicy themes as there are for Zemeckis to work with, this is as much a Hanks masterpiece as anything elseOverall, ""Forrest Gump"" is no less than landmark cinematic effort. It captures the essence of Baby Boomer social struggles and does so in ways that make it timeless. Much like Zemeckis' earlier ""Back To The Future"", it is also a film in which not one scene is wasted. There is something interesting to either behold or ponder in quite literally every frame. Every time I watch this movie, I appreciate it a little bit more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"everyman,,,","Robert Zemeckis directed this movie, Forrest Gump, in 1994. It well maintained the theme from the original version of book, ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" and ""Stupid is as stupid does"" This movie contains a lot of great actors and actresses who could act their own characters very well and showed the theme or plot. The reason why this film became so popular is because this story isn't just for the certain period or certain people, but for everyone.The movie begins in the small fictional town in Alabama but soon; the setting of this movie goes on to the whole world. The setting also proves about the universal theme, ""Everyman"" All the important events happen between late 1950s to late1980s. This movie doesn't only affects about late 1950s to late1980s but the present time also. Such as white trash and people who have physical problems didn't live only between 1950s to 1980s but they still exist.There are several characters that strongly affect the theme or the plot of this movie. First of all, the surrealistic character, Forrest Gump who was acted by Tom Hanks well represented the theme and also well showed of physical problem of Forrest. His IQ was under 70 and he had a problem with his legs when he was young. When he became an adult, he was still prejudged by people based on his intelligence. However, later he becomes really famous and rich. This event doesn't really mean to show that Forrest Gump became a successful person, but the movie is trying to break a strong stereotype of people, by using Forrest Gump. Also, it is telling not to judge people's ability or characteristics by intelligence or physical abilities. Like his quote ""stupid is as stupid does."" Mrs. Gump, Sally Fields, the actress was actor playing the mother of Forrest shows the theme of strong determination of all mothers in the world. Even though only ten year older than the grown Forrest Gump, her acting was so realistic that the audience didn't realize her age. Jenny, who was acted by Robin Wright, showed the reality of dark side of Americans' life. In the movie Jenny was the ""white trash"" but she isn't the only who is showing the theme of American life but partly, but through L.T he is somehow showing it too. He's character was so realistic. A deep friendship is expressed through his characterization.Generally, there are six most interesting events that are happening in this movie. In my opinion, starting the movie by grown Forrest Gump talking about his childhood from the present time on the bench is a good idea. His first interesting event starts when he entered school. He had a hard time. On the school bus everyone seemed to avoid him or be as far away from him, only because of his physical appearance. But later, Jenny who didn't look about her appearance came to him and be friend. Other than this, there are three events that Forrest Gump becoming all famous and meeting the U.S president three times. With this event, the plot goes really high in audience interest and I'm sure that viewers loved these events. Lastly, there is one important event left, about Jenny and Forrest that went audience very pleased but not a real happy ending.I was very impressed with this movie, especially with the acting skills and the themes of this story. This is a film that everyone would like and feel empathy with all these characters. The plot also appeals to average and ordinary people. I recommend this movie to all people no matter how old they are.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Forrest Gump: A Story About Being Kind and Brave,"""Forrest Gump"" isn't just a movie about a guy running through history. It's a touching story that shows us how unexpected life can be and how simple kindness can change the world. Forrest, played by Tom Hanks, is a man who might not be the smartest by book standards, but his heart is bigger than most. He finds himself in the middle of big events from history, but it's his innocent view of life that really makes us think.This movie is special because it mixes real history with Forrest's personal adventures, making it feel like you're going on a journey with him. It's funny, sad, and heartwarming all at once. Forrest's way of seeing the world teaches us about love, friendship, and doing what's right, no matter how hard it gets.What's cool about ""Forrest Gump"" is that it's more than a history lesson. It's a reminder that being kind and true to yourself can lead to amazing things. It's a movie for anyone who's ever felt a little out of place, showing that it's okay to be different.

Sugar-coated Trojan horse,"This movie uses all the sappy, sentimental tricks in the book to sucker the audience into believing in poor, disadvantaged Forrest Gump: the sick mother, the bad legs, the innocence of incomplete mental capacity, the bullies, the girlfriend, etc.If that's as far as it went, however, I wouldn't be writing this. The dangerous thing about this movie is its sweeping generalizations and stereotypical portrayals of events, groups, and people in recent American history. Because the filmmakers have succeeded in getting the viewer to pull so strongly for Gump, they can then pass off their revisionist version of the past few decades with little objection from the viewer.Yes, it's just a movie, but images like these shape the way people think. The anti-war movement in the sixties and seventies and the Black Panthers, for example, were much more complex than portrayed in this movie. Using tiny, value-charged episodes to paint with such broad brush strokes, in settings that are designed to pull the viewer to Gump's side, is deceptive and manipulative.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I thought ""He is like me and I know how it is to be teased."" considering I have mild cerebral palsy this movie meant my life and how I can see others treat you different when you have ""special legs"". I learned from this movie just because you have special legs and you are not considered ""smart"" don't let that hold you back. It never did and I'am thankful for this movie.

Still a great classic 90s movie.,"Watched many times and although nearly 25 years later it might be look a bit dusty now and the 90s CGI not as advanced as it is now, but is one of the greatest movies and one of the finest performances of Tom Hanks. Loved the narration and the interactions with various famous people , although again some of the CGI is dated. Favorite period in the movie for me was the Vietnam section. Its a long haul movie at 2 hours 20 minutes. I never really got the message that although he had the low IQ he achieved so much in his life. Quite the contradiction. He even comes across as autistic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the best cinematic works of our time,"Have to add two cents to the pile, not anything new. The work is so stunning in character, depth of story, direction, camera, editing, acting, and whatever else that makes a movie, that there is hardly anything to say, except see it if you haven't, and see it again if you have.Having lived through much of the period so incredibly depicted in the work, and having had many similar experiences,(a bit less dramatic, but emotionally equal), the work is as real as memory. The emotional power created in the work is overwhelming and wonderful. The Gump character, as vehicle through those incredible years, is cinematic genius, hilarious, ridiculous, endearing, hideous and heartbreaking, in a perfect body of work. Just see the flik, and please believe in it's accuracy as historic work, parody, irony, and any other five cent words that describe poetic perfection in a movie. It is as true as it gets on any level. Apocalypse Now may be the most accurate depiction of the psychology of war victims(I.e.combatants) ever produced, and Gump is equally perfect describing the psychology of the rest of us, mirrored against the character Gump, unchanged, unaffected, pure, but intensely human, perhaps perfectly human. Our reaction to this film is a great way to measure ourselves as human beings. What more can you say about a flik?",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
entertaining but shallow,"Entertaining comedy/drama/fantasy has a lot to keep you busy (and excellent special effects), but doesn't measure up to its epic pretensions. It would've benefited from sticking to comedy and eschewing sentiment. Instead it pushes every button imaginable to jerk a reaction out of the viewer, and tries to dictate your emotions with a pushy music score. The movie lapses into silliness at times, and is self-indulgent for the last hour. Director Robert Zemeckis attempts to evoke each era by illustrating its clichés and by scoring it to a procession of over-familiar songs that serve as lazy, embarrassingly obvious signifiers of their times (Sweet Home Alabama, Hound Dog, Blowin' in the Wind, California Dreamin', For What it's Worth, On the Road Again, Mrs. Robinson, etc.). I love a lot of those songs, but they've become clichés themselves by now. Tom Hanks is funny and convincing in the title role, but Forrest is too much of an invincible saint to be very interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
One of the most over-rated American films of all time!!!,"How can you start talking about a movie like ""Forrest Gump"" without being bias on the whole hype that has been surrounding it since it came out. For someone who actually knows about films, it is a personal insult that the Academy Awards considered this movie to be in higher standards than...Pulp Fiction The Shawshank Redemption Quiz Show and even Four Weddings and a Funeraland how could Robert Zemeckis' (I hate that name) work be considered better than...Krzysztof Kieslowski for RED!!!!!!!!!!! Quentin Tarantino for PULP FICTION!!!!!! Woody Allen for BULLETS OVER BROADWAY!!!!!! Robert Redford for QUIZ SHOW!!!!!!! Not to mention that the Academy is such an airhead that Frank Darabont the director of The Shawshank Redemption wasn't even nominated!!!!!!Let's consider MANY important factors for this movie to be loved blindly, without a true sense of reflection and observation.Number 1: I have to much time on my hands,Number 2: It stars Tom Hanks who undoubtedly represents the white, flawless way of American Life. He is the Jimmy Stewart of today (that could not hurt). He is talented, but highly overrated. He has some excellent performances, but he always seems the same to me. He could never have the talent that actors like Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Sean Penn, Russell Crowe or Denzel Washington have to reinvent themselves every time in a different role. He is the typical American male sweetheart, regardless everybody loves him. His star power more than his ability as an actor helped this movie to get sold and appreciated.Number 3: Stories about characters with disabilities always, and I mean always sell in Hollywood (Rainman, I am Sam, Nell, My Left Foot, Awakenings, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest) not that I am saying that these great films compare to Forrest Gump, but the idea itself whether good or bad sells.Number 4: The history of the United States is taken rather lightly in this movie, all the events that take place around the character happen without his knowledge in the most unconvincing of methods. Racism, Vietnam, meeting a number of American Presidents, his unheard speech at Lincoln Memorial, the hippies, drugs, Bubba Gump shrimp, apple computers, amongst other historic events in which the character gets involved, but does not seem to grasp the magnitude of those very events. He is mentally handicaped as we are shown from the beginning, so because we are suppose to believe that he is emotionally handicap too. He never seems to get emotionally affected by anything, unless it involves Jenny, even then it does not appear to be convincing or moving in any way.Number 5: The story itself appears to me as manipulative, sappy, uncompromised and made in half measures. It touches certain issues, but never dwells on them with justice. The ingenuity of the character, his disability seems enough reason to feel that all the events are seen with a certain depth. Which they are not. It is unfair, because Hanks' charm and Gump's likeable stupidity work as a hook to entangle people's emotions. It never allows for anyone to make an effort to see beyond the  story and into the gut of what was attempted to be said.Number 6: Stupid moments, everybody loves them, Hollywood is an expert of what people like and what they want to spend their money on. Gump begins a ""marathon"" across the country for no real reason at all, half way decides he's had enough, by then the entire country was following him (as a metaphor for the movie itself). Elvis Presley the King or Rock ends up as a youngster, who knows how, in Gump's house as a visitor. Gump who has braces in his legs miraclously teaches him the dance moves that made him famous. Something that I personally cannot consider to be taken lightly is an issue like the Vietnam War, but Forrest somehow manages to run in and out the jungle in the middle war saving people left and right. Maybe Zemeckis never read a book or even watched a film (Apocalypse Now, Platoon, Full Metal Jacket, Casualties of War) to illustrate him on what really happened on that war. Young soldiers were getting killed by the dozen. Forrest Gump is a fairy tale based on unfounded grounds and hypocritical notions of ""reality"". Oliver Stone dedicated his film Platoon to the American soldiers in Vietnam, he went there for real and saw what happened. Zemeckis has decided to ignore all these factors and still believe that his adored character could even be immune to a experience like Vietnam (in every aspect possible).To conclude please do not let yourself be manipulated, not just because Forrest Gump won the oscar for Best Picture makes it one of the best films of the 90's. The ""sweetness"" of this movie is not even sweet, its only the a ploy, a sales pitch of the American Dream. In 20 years who will remember Forrest Gump, and more importantly who will remember that film when The Shawshank Redemption and Pulp Fiction are still in people's memories for real reasons. They are art films, Forrest Gump the oscar's favorite.And seriously folks if you haven't seen Kieslowski's RED run over to blockbuster and rent it. Its the end of the Color Trilogy. Then you'll know what we mean.thank you. VIVA EL CINE!!!!",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A Heartwarming Journey of Innocence and Resilience,"Tom Hanks delivers a remarkable performance in the role of Forrest Gump, perfectly capturing the character's unique blend of innocence, kindness, and unwavering optimism. Hanks' portrayal is nothing short of masterful, as he immerses himself in the character and brings him to life with sincerity and depth. Forrest's unwavering belief in the goodness of humanity serves as a poignant reminder of the power of compassion and resilience.The film's narrative unfolds through a series of flashbacks as Forrest recounts his life story to strangers he encounters while sitting on a park bench. This storytelling device allows the audience to witness the significant moments and relationships that shaped Forrest's life, from his childhood friendship with Jenny (Robin Wright) to his service in the Vietnam War and his unexpected success as a ping-pong champion.Forrest Gump seamlessly weaves together elements of drama, comedy, and romance, creating a tapestry of emotions that captivates and engages the viewer. The screenplay, based on Winston Groom's novel, is a brilliant blend of heartfelt moments, sharp wit, and thought-provoking social commentary. It explores themes of love, friendship, destiny, and the power of an individual to make a positive impact on the world, no matter their intellectual capacity.Robert Zemeckis' direction is both sensitive and visually stunning. The film skillfully integrates Forrest's interactions with real historical figures and events, creating a sense of authenticity and grounding the story in a tangible reality. The seamless special effects enhance the storytelling, allowing the audience to experience Forrest's journey through different time periods with a sense of wonder and believability.Forrest Gump boasts an outstanding supporting cast, with Robin Wright delivering a standout performance as Jenny, Forrest's lifelong love interest. Her portrayal adds depth and complexity to the film, exploring themes of personal growth, redemption, and the lasting impact of childhood traumas. Gary Sinise shines as Lieutenant Dan Taylor, providing a compelling portrayal of a wounded Vietnam War veteran grappling with his own demons.The film's iconic soundtrack, featuring a collection of popular songs from the 1950s to the 1980s, serves as a nostalgic backdrop to the story, evoking a sense of time and place. The music not only enhances the emotional resonance of the film but also serves as a reflection of the cultural and historical context in which Forrest's journey unfolds.In conclusion, Forrest Gump is a timeless masterpiece that combines exceptional performances, a heartfelt story, and a touch of magic to create an unforgettable cinematic experience. Tom Hanks' portrayal of the lovable and resilient Forrest Gump, coupled with Robert Zemeckis' direction and a well-crafted screenplay, make this film a triumph of storytelling. It reminds us of the power of kindness, the importance of embracing life's unpredictable moments, and the enduring impact of a pure heart. Forrest Gump is a must-watch for anyone seeking a heartfelt and uplifting cinematic experience.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The best film that's ever been made,I don't know how many times I've watched this film. It's probably 50 or 100. Once a year I rewatch it and become as emotional and as astonished as the very first time I saw it. There hasn't been a film since Forrest Gump and maybe there never will be. I will never forget how it felt to be touched by this story and the characters that hold it so perfectly together. This is unquestionably Tom Hank's greatest performance ever and the only film I am totally unable to criticise. Truly the definition of a masterpiece.....,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Superior Life-Guide Movie,"This movie is a classic of cinematography, beautifully filmed and edited with such an amazing, heartwarming story about an individual named Forrest Gump and his epic life journey featured with timeless themes such as love, friendship, and kindness.Robert Zemeckis did a great job making such an amazing movie, which can be shortly described as a Life Guide.And here's why:
Forrest Gump is a simple, generous guy with an estimated IQ of 75 and some autistic features. He doesn't care about what people think and say about him. He just does what he wants to. You won't expect something extraordinary from a guy like this. But his low intellect and independence from the opinions of other people are actually his secret powers, which give him the ability to do the same thing for a long period of time and allow him to be doubtless about new beginnings. Forrest is not afraid to do anything he wants, while other people doubt everything, sitting in the same place their whole life. Also, Forrest is very kind to everyone, even though people sometimes treat him meanly.Lots of people are dreaming about changing the world, but hardly any of them are thinking to start this change from themselves. Pursue your own path, do what you desire, and treat others as you would like to be treated yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Timeless classic,"An amazing film about all that surrounds us: about feelings, about people, about family and very special views on it. We often don't notice much.This seems to us to be a vision of Forrest Gump - an incredible character, a kind of 'big kid' who perceives everything more obvious in a completely different way.Throughout the film, we observe the life of Forrest. We will see his childhood, good and bad moments from there. University, football team, Vietnam War, successful business - it's all about Forrest's life.He lives in his own little, personal world.He is really kind.He is ready for extraordinary deeds, regardless of the framework that people come up with for themselves.Thats the kind of people that society lacks: those who are always able to help, even if this help seems completely ridiculous, but you know in your heart that it is needed.The actors are playing great. You no longer think that they are playing, it seems that you are just looking at someone's life, at the life of a person that might live somewhere nearby and sees everything in their own way.It's a sentimental and thought-provoking movie that's hard to write about, just watch.So just watch, empathize and feel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A great fantasy story with a lifetime of messages for all of us.,"Once again, I watched ""Forrest Gump"" for Christmas. While it isn't a ""Christmas Movie"", to me it contains a message that is better than most Christmas movies. I have seen it a number of times over the years, I own the DVD. Sometimes I hesitate, because it is so long, but once I am watching it the time passes quickly, there is never a dull moment.To me the story here embodies the main messages that any of us should carry through life. Don't dwell on your shortcomings, look towards your opportunities. Play on your strengths. Be diligent, treat others well, be willing to learn from others, always give it your best. And it does all this in an entertaining way, through the fictional escapades of Gump.This is told in a fantasy story, of a young boy with leg braces and an I.Q. of 75, whose mother refused to let that get Forrest down. She always encouraged him. He never sought fame, but by sheer luck found himself in situations where his latent talents could come forward and shine.Tom Hanks of course is super as grown-up Forrest, and I believe this movie is well on its way to becoming a classic the way ""A Wonderful Life"" has become a classic.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Surprisingly enjoyable,"There's something of a tradition in fiction of using the idiot savant to hold the mirror up to society and reflect its foibles. The figure of the Good Soldier Schweik was one I remember being introduced to in my early years at university. Forrest Gump is also a soldier for much of this picture's duration, but the satire is diluted to no more than a few bum and fart jokes in the presence of the great and the good.Maybe it's this evasiveness that caused this film to attract such a storm of criticism from the Left when it first appeared. Seven years on, it's hard to see the film's reluctance to take on biting social satire as something it deserved to be damned for. More likely, it's the film's unflattering portrayal of the counter culture of the sixties that made its baby boomer critics touchy. For the most part, it's a gentle and appealingly whimsical picture. Australian - and more particularly, Melbourne - viewers will recognize in it something of the spirit of Michael Leunig's cartoons. In keeping with this spirit is the one aspect of this film that could be regarded as controversial, which is its scepticism toward causes.Tom Hanks is excellent. It says something about the rest of the world's stereotypes about American culture that one of America's biggest movie stars can hold the screen for hour after hour while remaining the most self-effacing of actors. There is charm and real emotion in his performance. If the film sometimes veers into sentimentality (and it does) it is not Hanks' fault.The film isn't a masterpiece. As I say, it does sometimes lapse into sentimentality, and it annoys me that, like Rain Man, it can't acknowledge disability without conferring on its disabled characters superhuman talents of one kind or another. And, as I'm sure others have pointed out, the trick shots involving Gump's encounters with various historical personages had already been done - to much sharper comic effect - by Woody Allen in Zelig. However, for me the film's greatest specific failing is that it doesn't do more with the character of Gump's love, Jenny, who doesn't do much more in this film than turn up every half hour or so and look beautiful. I thought there was scope there to explore the nature of their mutual dependence more deeply, and to illuminate both characters in the process. To some extent this does happen with the character of Lieutenant Dan, a nicely drawn character who provides the right sort of counterweight to Gump.I don't expect that I will want to see this film again and again, the way I keep going back to Leunig's cartoons, which have a kind of natural wisdom-in-innocence that Zemeckis' film sometimes visibly strains to achieve. It's not a film that particularly goes anywhere, not that it really means to. But, a little to my surprise, I did enjoy watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

He survives in Vietnam, make a few millions, etc... although i was surprised that amongst nearly 100 comments i have read. I havent' seen anyone who would define a film storyline as a lovestory, not as american history at glance with offensive characters painted by stupid Forrest Gump and his black best friend, who is not so bright too and speak about his shrimp business all the time.

This movie is designed to sedate the viewer into feeling as if the world is fine and dandy just the way it is, and that they too, without doing anything at all to improve, educate or enlighten themselves, can be a ""success"" without trying.  A satisfied public is easy to control, for better or for worse . . .",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Forrest Gump,"A foolish Forrest Gump from South Alabama, his lifelong love for a woman is Jenny. From childhood to adulthood, Forrest Gump and Jenny have been good friends. They went to school together, grew up together, and even though they were far apart, Forrest Gump always loved Jenny. No matter what she did, no matter who she was, no matter how old or ugly she became, no matter where she was, Forrest Gump was always in his home in South Alabama, missing his girl day and night and waiting for Jenny's return day and night.This is Forrest Gump, this is his love, this is his Jenny.We recall the first scene, where Forrest Gump is in Jenny's dormitory. Jenny asks him what kind of person he wants to become in the future, and Forrest Gump is stunned for a moment, saying, ""Am I not being myself? Jenny said she wants to become a singer and become famous, but Forrest still doesn't understand and says he just wants to be himself.I was deeply moved by this scene because although Forrest Gump is a fool, he understands what he really needs. Becoming famous, earning money, and becoming a successful person are not important. What matters is that we should do our best. Why do we deserve respect from others? Is it because of our profession?

An Emotional Journey Through Decades of American History,"Robert Zemeckis's ""Forrest Gump"" is a heartfelt and epic tale that combines humor, drama, and historical events to create a uniquely compelling narrative. Tom Hanks delivers an unforgettable performance as Forrest Gump, a man of limited intelligence but boundless heart and spirit, whose life journey intersects with pivotal moments in 20th-century American history.Hanks's portrayal of Forrest is both charming and poignant, capturing the character's innocence and unwavering optimism. His performance earned him an Academy Award for Best Actor, solidifying his status as one of Hollywood's finest talents. The supporting cast, including Robin Wright as Jenny, Forrest's troubled childhood friend and love interest, and Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan, Forrest's embittered but ultimately redeemed commanding officer, provide strong, memorable performances that add depth to the story.Zemeckis's direction is skillful, blending emotional storytelling with innovative special effects that seamlessly insert Forrest into historical footage. The screenplay, adapted by Eric Roth from Winston Groom's novel, is rich with memorable lines and moments that balance humor and tragedy. The film's pacing ensures that each chapter of Forrest's life is engaging and impactful.Alan Silvestri's score, along with an iconic soundtrack featuring hits from the 1950s to the 1980s, enhances the film's nostalgic and emotional appeal. Cinematographer Don Burgess captures the diverse settings and eras beautifully, adding to the film's immersive quality.""Forrest Gump"" is more than a chronicle of one man's extraordinary life; it is a reflection on destiny, love, and the resilience of the human spirit.

It touches me even more. About friends(mostly). I've had a few friends that have lasted 20-30 years. The ones that are always there. Even if they're not always there, they are with you. I still talk to these friends regularly even though I have moved away and so have another of them.This movie hit me in that department in my recent age.This movie makes you laugh, there is action, and drama. Tom Hanks emotions in the end of the movie may bring tears to your eyes. This is why it was one of the greats. It moves at a good pace. Moves along Forrest Gumps life. Mostly people who grew up in the 50's would notice the cultural references. But as a person born in the 80's with a family that liked 60's music and culture, it worked well for me. This movie will still remind you, even if you were not born back then, that you will never forget your old friends. The ones that will always be with you. Those select few that are still there from childhood to adulthood. That is what I took out of this. That is why this movie hits hard. Forrest does have new(er) friends and that is still nice. At least he has somebody.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Revisionist history:- after only 30 years.,"The thing that really spoils my enjoyment of this film is the way history is re-written.Not ancient history, but history which I lived through. In real-life the anti-war protesters were venting their disapproval of what they earnestly felt was an immoral war. They took a lot of knocks from the powers that be for their troubles as well.This movie depicts them as shallow, selfish, manipulative, power-driven, and even violent people (there's irony for you!) who were ""Unamerican"" in every sense of the word.The odious message of this movie is that ignorance is bliss. Don't think about things and everything will work out nicely and you will be happy. Well at least you'll get rich - which in most American movies is close enough.It's enough to make a person gag.Oh, and the fact it beat Pulp Fiction and Shawshank Redemption to the best picture Oscar doesn't help either.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

What a movie!,"I lived in China and in 1995 when I was still a high school student, I watched this movie for its reputation  won several Oscar. Honestly I felt bored when I was watching the movie that time because I could hardly understand the meaning of the movie and could hardly feel its beauty. At that time, only ""The Terminator"" kind of movies was able to attract me. After I watched it for the second time now after 11 years, I felt quite moved by almost all the elements this movie carries, the story, quotes, special effect, Tom Hank's perfect portray of Forrest Gump and most importantly, Forrest's deepest innate world. It's not easy to conclude what kind of person Gump is and what are the meanings and inspiration this fictitious character conveys to all the viewers. But I do have the strongest inspiration from this movie, that is, people can really get somewhere to achieve something not only because they have a lot of good qualities, more importantly, from what we see on Forrest Gump, because of not having a lot of bad qualities, or innate weakness of human beings, or various interferences around everybody. You can see all those bad qualities, weaknesses and interferences from the lives of Lt. Dan and Jenny who are normal or seemingly smart persons. On the contrary, Forrest is a person with low IQ and was thought of by many people as moron. Yes, Forrest is not smart and he knows it quite well. But for me, exactly because of his being not so smart, he doesn't have those bad things that other normal persons have that prevent them from achieving what Forrest was able to achieve. Those people have too many thoughts sometimes, or too much expectation, or too much depression in face of setbacks and all those things are actually interferences to the normal people that prevent them from staying focused for a long time. Now I should be looking at myself and asking myself, what kind of interferences I should remove from myself to really get somewhere. Thanks, Forrest Gump, thanks, this fabulous movie that sheds so much light on me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

...And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump,"I think of Forrest Gump (1994) directed by Robert Zemeckis as a fantasy or a fairy tale set in the real world, and what a marvelous tale it is. It's been 15 years since I saw the film for the first time with my 13- years-old son. We were impressed, touched, and moved by it equally. We laughed, we could not contain tears, and we lived together with the hero, the childlike, naive, and innocent Forrest Gump, the most unusual lead character you can think of. FG was a big hit when it was released, and it went on to receive 6 Oscars including for The Best Picture, Director, Best Actor, Best Visual Effects, and Best Screen Play. The film's Oscar status has made it one of the controversial choices among the film viewers. Some completely agree that FG deserved all its awards and its love. The others, and quite few to that believe that the film is totally overrated, sickly sweet, and it is nothing more than the American propaganda of mediocrity. They believe that the film's main idea is, follow the orders, do what you are told, and even if your intellect is low or almost non-existent, with a little bit of luck, you would achieve the success in your life and even would change the history by simply being at the right place in the right time. How wrong I believe they are. You can't think of Forrest Gump as a real person. He is a fairy tale character, or rather the embodiment of a human with no cynicism whatsoever, the candid, pure, innocent man who is not quick or witty but who knows bad from good and right from wrong and through whose eyes we see the historical events in the live of this country for about thirty years of the last Century. Forrest may not be an intellectual prodigy but he was led through life's hardships, by the inner moral compass if you will and he knows the very simple truths that he never misses - love and loyalty to his mother, his friends, the girl he loves and his Country.The movie covers the look at America not only from Forrest's point of view. Another look at alternative, rebellious, counterculture America was very well presented through Jenny's life. Between them two, I believe the film's creators were able to show the changing times and changing face of this country. Technically and visually, the film is a marvel. The best songs of the time that were used in the film soundtrack are great and I don't mind them sound almost all the time -the more the better. Tom Hanks had achieved the very difficult task. His Forrest is simple but not laughable. He is a decent and very good man. It is not easy to create such idealistic character and to make him alive and sympathetic. There is not a single false note in Hanks' performance, and he absolutely deserves the Oscar.When I rewatched the film recently, it touched me as deeply now as it did 15 years ago, and this is for me the sign of not just good but a great movie. And that's all I have to say about Forrest Gump.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
WHERE'S JIMMY?,"'Forrest Gump' was an inoffensive and entertaining enough movie without being spectacular cinema. However, my comments concern one (possibly two) odd aspects of the moviePresident Jimmy Carter was NOT featured in the film. All the others except Ford (his omission is perhaps understandable) were featured. In fact, it turns out Forrest's actions were pivotal in the downfall of Nixon.There's another odd aspect about Jimmy Carter. Not long after Forrest is depicted watching American bi-centennial celebrations (July 4 1976, presumably) he starts running from sea to shining sea 'for no particular reason'. Furthermore, he stops running just prior to the depiction of the assassination attempt on Reagan, from memory. This means that Forrest was running (remember, 'for no particular reason') for just about exactly the duration of the Carter administration. I guess this explains why Forrest never met President Carter. Is this some sort of comment on the Carter administration (perhaps that America lost it's way under Carter - a dubious proposition at best) or simply co-incidence? I wonder!Also, the landscape at the spot where Forrest stops running is the same landscape featured on the Eagles Greatest Hits album. I don't think there's any sub text here, except that it's quite a remarkable landscape",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Great Film, Horrible Message","I have a difficult time watching (and reviewing) `Forrest Gump'.  Despite the brilliance of its actors, of director Robert Zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, I find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie.  On the surface, `Gump' is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character.  Under that sweetness, though is a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea.For the seven people who haven't seen `Forrest Gump', the film deals with the travels and troubles of one Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), an affable man with an IQ of 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in `Zelig'-like fashion.  Forrest inadvertently teaches Elvis to swivel his hips.  Forest accidentally becomes a football star.  Forest accidentally becomes a Vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman.  (See a pattern?)  Throughout all his travels and misadventures, Forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship  and he can never seem to fully capture the love of his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright-Penn)  but through sheer niceness and through blind faith in the goodness of others, Forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in life.Again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film.  Despite my own misgivings about the film, there's no doubt that Tom Hanks is simply awesome as Gump  he clearly deserved the Oscar he won for the role. He gives Forrest Gump a childlike innocence, but there's more to it that that; there's a certain confidence that he exudes at all the right times, as well as insecurities at his low moments.  Forrest Gump is certainly far more complex than the simple figure he appears to be at first glance, and I can't think of any actor who could've played it better than Hanks.  Robin Wright-Penn is perfect as Jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened cynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience.  I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for an Oscar as well.  Gary Sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to Gump in the Vietnam era as Lieutenant Dan, another person who can't seem to travel through life quite as smoothly as Forrest does.  Combine this with a superbly paced film, with moments both funny and sorrowful (often at the same time), as well as some of the best, subtle uses of CGI effects ever put to celluloid, and `Forrest Gump' should be one of the best films of all time.  Right?In my opinion, no.  `Gump' is a bitter, bitter movie.  Look at Jenny's dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually accomplishes.  Ditto the dreams of Lieutenant Dan, or Gump's friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson).  For them, their hopes never ultimately amount to anything, not without the `accidental' help of Forrest Gump, anyway.  Forrest, who has no ambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing.  In essence, those who dare to dream in `Forrest Gump' are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely rewarded.  Considering that some of Jenny's dreams (and Lieutenant Dan's) are particularly selfish  in fact, a few are downright noble  I found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing.  It bothered me enough to make me not like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain.`Forrest Gump' gets an overall grade of a C+ -- it starts out as an `A', but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level.  But hey, I could be wrong.  It's simply the Mad Reviewer's opinion.  Good or bad, there's some great performances, and it's also thought-provoking.  Watch it for yourself, and let me know what you think.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
More corn than Kelloggs,"This has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen.

Anyone who is a film buff has to see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Simply one of the Greatest American Films ...,"""Forrest Gump"" is one of the rare cases of cinema's magic working more than in any other artistic medium. Everything is a visual delight and a triumph in the field of storytelling, from the cinematography to the editing, from Zemeckis' sober direction to an extraordinary lesson of acting from Tom Hanks, the movie IS the Best Picture of 1994, which is saying a lot, and one of the best American films.Every film tells a story, but a few of them have this capability to penetrate your hearts and engage your emotions like ""Forrest Gump"". There are no villains in ""Forrest Gump"", no room for negativity, the only adversity consists on the many obstacles that life puts on your path, and the only form of heroism relies on the ability to overcome these obstacles, and whether you succeed or fail, the point is to keep your faith on life, and find your own Alchemy to transform coal in gold. And Forrest Gump is the first to have overcome the handicaps that would have deprived him from a 'normal' life.The flash-back introducing sight of little Forrest with his legs' braces, hand in hand with Mama Gump (remarkably played by Sally Field) would be too tragic if the script didn't rightfully choose to adopt a more lighthearted tone by making Forrest Gump the privileged witness of his time, of a cinematic journey in American History, with every piece of this epic puzzle connected in a way or another to him. I will never forget my first impression from the Elvis Presley part, the first indication of what would be the life of Gump. Something too promising to be eternally stuck in these handicapping braces, and the laughs work as the patient build up to a rewarding climactic moment, the miracle scene or an overwhelming celebration of the triumph of human spirit.And from this miracle, Forrest Gump becomes the fastest man in the world, and starts one of the most exhilarating chain of events that ever enriched a character. This is the power of Forrest Gump, a character defined by the way he is, the way he talks, the way he loves, defined by the events he lived, by those he underwent, and those he influenced, by the people that helped and loved him and people he helped and loved. Not one-dimensional or dim-witted, Gump is one of the most memorable and fascinating characters that even graced the silver screen. Who can ever forget ""My name is Forrest. Forrest Gump""? Through his silent moments, gestures, speech mannerisms and Tom Hanks' unique talent to transcend his everyday look, Gump conveys the profundity of a character affected and affecting a world in constant change, mirroring Mama Gump's unforgettable 'chocolate box' catchphrase.And what an epic life for an epic era, Gump's talent launches his football athlete career, which gives him a ticket to college, from college to the Army, where he'll become a Ping Pong player before converting to shrimp fishing. Every achievement of Forrest Gump is due to someone he loves, starting with his Mama who traded her dignity to provide her son the best education, Jenny, his best friend whose unforgettable ""Run, Forrest Run"" will drain the miraculous force that would change his life. And his friend Bubba who'll indirectly provide the basis of Gump's fortune thanks to a simple promise. And whatever Forrest took, he gave it back, to his mother, to Jenny, to his best friend's memory, and to Lieutenant Dan, who thought he had to die in the field of honor, and learned the value of life from Forrest's unshakable friendship.That's why I don't get the criticism toward the film, as if Forrest Gump was a kind of liberal incarnation of the passive state of mind that guarantees happiness. Why do people feel the need to appear so smart, to consider a movie where someone got shot in the face accidentally, superior, and it's a fan of ""Pulp Fiction"" speaking here. Maybe, I've missed a point, but ""Forrest Gump"" is perfectly aware of its comedic mood that almost flirts with parody sometimes. Eric Roth's Oscar-winning script is a kaleidoscope of all the incarnations of America in people's imagery through a glorious succession of anecdotes involving entertainment, music, politics, Presidents, scandals, Vietnam War, following one of the greatest cinematic soundtracks : the Doors, Dylan, Hendrix  ""Forrest Gump"" is a wonderful voyage to Pop-Culture America! And the intelligence of the script is subtly hinted in some little details like when Forrest evokes his perfect integration in the Army. This is pure comedy gold without any forced laughs.And as there's no better comedy than a comedy with a heart, on that level, ""Forrest Gump"" is so lighthearted it's almost blinding. I guess this comes from Forrest's heart, so pure, so white, like the cinematic allegory of Voltaire's Candid. How fitting that his last job is gardener, which mirrors Candid's motto that whatever happens, ""we need to cultivate our garden"". Gump does cultivate his garden as a sort of dream-like presence in a very familiar universe, a dream we'd loved to reach and touch, something that floats in our minds like this beautiful feather floating on the sky. Men like Forrest Gump are oddities only made believable through the magic of cinema with no other meaning than to inspire something pure in us.This is why any attempt to rationally analyze ""Forrest Gump"" and discredit its success is representative of that loss of common innocence, this cynicism people disguise in lucidity and realism, unknowing that they fall in the same trap than those who ran with Gump thinking it had a meaning while Forrest Gump only ""felt like running"". Gump didn't necessarily choose his path, but he always followed his heart, his idea of love and friendship. ""I'm not a smart man. But I know what love is"". On that level, Forrest Gump was simply a goddamn genius!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Best Picture Oscar winners are like a box of chocolates.....,"Forrest Gump, from a humble afflicted childhood, and with a low IQ, goes on to play a major part in the history of the second part of the 20th century.Forrest Gump is one of those movies that comes along every once in a while to light a fuse under the movie worlds bottom! The sort of film that has evident flaws yet packs in so much charm, wit, intelligence and sentiment to make it really difficult to dislike with any sort of conviction. Even those with an aversion to the talent of Tom Hanks would surely be kidding themselves if they honestly fail to see that Hanks, as Gump, gives anything less than an extraordinary performance.What made Forrest Gump such a well loved picture? Garnering 5 golden baldies at the Academy Awards {three of them the main ones} and earning a staggering $677,387,716 worldwide after being made for the now relatively paltry sum of $55 million? Personally I think it has a little of everything that a film watcher wants in a picture, it sure does have things many dislike {the romantic arc, the overdose of sugary sentiment}, but as Forrest lurches from each apparently none-plussed situation to another, the air of the underdog coming thru triumphant sticks in the craw, but, in a most appetising way. We are in the company of a perfectly honest, simple and innocent man, he may not know it, but Forrest Gump has become a champion of the people, both in the film and to us the movie loving public.If by some miracle you still haven't seen Forrest Gump, then I urge you to do so, it may not resonate with you as much as it did/does the majority {argue with the box office I say}, but for towering performances by Tom Hanks and Gary Sinise, and for being a clever movie with its finger on the pulse of Hollywood, Forrest Gump has few peers. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Right Wing Propaganda Disguised as Heartwarming Family Film,"FORREST GUMP may be the worst movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar. It is one of the most manipulative, insulting, patronizing, hateful, repugnant pieces of celluloid garbage I have ever had the displeasure of watching ooze across the screen.The message of FORREST GUMP? Always do what you're told and never think for yourself and you'll get rich. But be individualistic and live an anti-establishment life and you'll get AIDS and die. That's this whole sickening movie in a nutshell.Let's be fair, though. The performances are what got this movie it's acclaim, and nothing else. Tom Hanks is superb, as are Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. Robin Wright, as usual, appears to be reading from cue cards. The movie is well shot and there are some breathtaking moments, as when Forrest is running past the Rocky Mountains.On a technical note, I would love to castrate the SOB CGI artist who attempts to change people's lips to match new dialog written for them. And placing Hanks in newsreel footage over and over and over and over again. It's simply annoying, and serves no purpose other then to make us marvel at what they're capable of doing with special effects these days.According to this movie, Elvis couldn't come up with his own dance moves and John Lennon couldn't write ""Imagine"" without a little help from this brain dead moron. The only semi-positive aspect I can take from the movie's running joke of Gump creating many of our pop culture staples is that anyone who is amused by them must be as stupid as he is. There's a nice (and probably unintentional) satirical touch.FORREST GUMP is a right wing conservative propaganda film disguised as a heartwarming family film. It glorifies corporate greed, trivializes both Vietnam and the peace movement, and demonizes and lampoons anyone who tries to shake up the system. I despise this movie.

Narration overkill,"Forrest Gump is one of those movies where you can't really say you didn't like it without being criticized. Unless if you can back it up without some reasoning, excluding the term overrated. That just sounds like a lazy reason to most people, and even though I think it is overrated, I would still ask other people why they think it is overrated because I'm just a curious person. The response overrated is just disappointing for real but not professional movie critics like me.First off, Forrest's accent is over-exaggerated and obnoxious to hear for an 2 hour and a half movie. Imagine hearing it the theatres where the sound of his goofy and ridicules Alabama accent is pounding in my head. The only accent I liked in this movie was Bubba. In fact that will be my next point as to why I didn't like the movie too much:The movie moves off the characters too fast, as if they are all expendable characters in Family Guy and the character development is weak, narration explaining most of the characters choices instead of showing the choices that they make. This movie had mostly tell, not show. Hell, I could barely tell why he even liked Jenny in the first place. He just said I love you, I write to her all the time, i miss you jenny, marry me jenny. Then even worse, he tells us why he likes Jenny, instead her showing those personality traits herself.Granted, there was one instance in the movie where it Did actually show his love for her instead of telling it, which was when she got punched and he punched the guy back, and he told her that no one should hit her and that he would never hit her. That was my favorite part of the movie, but that's not even the most famous scene of the movie for some reason. That brings up another thingThe most famous and heard of scene is the scene when Jenny says ""Run, Forrest, Run"" Seriously? It was in the first 10 minutes of the movie, and they were still little kids when most of the movie was jumping from historical scene to the next one. The scene did not have emotional meaning to me, the phrase sounds more of a meme than anything else. Also, what made the scene even more overrated was when he started outrunning the bikes and all that crap. It just made the scene even more unbelievable and unrelatable. Now this whole running junk was redeemable when he went back to go save Bubba because he was my favorite character, but when I was watching the scene for the first time I was rolling my eyes.Still, I gave it a seven because even though the historical scenes were narrated and had no point to the plot at all except to show he's been everywhere, it was still mostly funny and showed his goofy personality and it was nice to see historical figures interact with an idiot and see their reactions.And the crippled guy who I will not bother looking up was a great redemption story character, although I thought his subplot story was more interesting than Forrest's love life, and I wish that they could have added more to it. Like, how did he score some hookers? I wish it would have explained that to me because I can't see why they would be interested in a cripple. Unless they were paid like a normal prostitute, but I don't remember the movie explaining them as prostitutes.Soundtrack was good, particularly ""Freebird."" Although the scene where it played it did not really match to what was going on and it was kind of confusing to me why they needed it then. Sweet Home Alabama is one of my most overrated and overplayed songs, and whenever I hear it I groan and complain. It's just so annoying!I wouldn't necessarily recommend this to somebody who wants to watch a famous movie, because I would recommend other movies like The Dark Knight or Requiem For A Dream or Donnie Darko or Silence of The Lambs but I can totally see other people recommending Forrest Gump. My advice would be, go check the movie out if you want to, and my opinion on this movie isn't as common as most people.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Technically Brilliant, Otherwise Barren","Yes, I watched in awe as Tom Hanks was digitally inserted into all the major events of the second half of the twentieth century, but my already opened jaw then went slack at the banality of the screenplay.Sorry, but ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" is not a philosophy for a grownup. Or even a retard.I loved the opening shot, and was really wanting to like this film, but Sally Field is embarrassing, ditto Tom Hanks. Gary Sinise is good, but Robin Wright's character makes no sense.There IS no moral or philosophical coherence to this film ... it just allows woolly thinkers around the world to project their own feel good mantras onto it.I give it a 5 for technical achievement(I stand by for the usual tirade of illiterate and obscene abuse I get when I dare to criticise a sacred cow.)",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"The film is like a box of chocolates, the further you get the sicker you feel","There's something really nasty at the heart of this movie which makes my skin crawl.

She leaves home for college and tries to make her own way in life, ending up with a violent partner, addicted to drugs and dying of AIDS. No amount of gloss could render such message palatable.

The dazzling American dream,"The first time I watched ""Forrest Gump"", I was confused by the feathers at the beginning and end of the film. What did the director mean by using this feather as the opening and closing ceremonies? After thinking about it, I felt that the feather seemed to be Forrest Gump's thoughts, so I didn't delve into it any further. After reading it today, I strongly felt that a feather floating to the ground is like a life coming to the world. This feather is flying in the vast sky, whether it is ""destined or drifting in the wind."" You have no way of knowing where it will land. The same is true in life, just like Forrest Gump's mother didn't know that she would become Forrest Gump's mother at the beginning, just like Forrest Gump didn't know at the beginning that God gave him an IQ of only 75, just like Captain Dan didn't know that he would become Forrest Gump's mother at the beginning It's the same pain as losing your legs.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"""Being an idiot is no box of chocolates"" (the original line from the novel)","A movie with this many comments obviously has great resonance. On the one hand, the movie is technically skillful, well-acted, and used then-advanced special effects to great advantage. As demonstrated by the comments here, it has charmed many viewers. On the other, the movie's values and message are clearly right wing: as many other reviewers point out, the plot rewards ignorance, unquestioning obedience, and laissez-faire corporatization (the marks of a good heart, apparently!), while it trivializes retardation to charm viewers with a saccharine vision of idiocy as goodness. It provides a right-wing allegory of recent US history by punishing the free-thinking Jenny and rewarding the mindless Forrest, named after Nathan Bedford Forrest, a founder of the Ku Klux Klan. Charming!I share the view of those who not entertained by the movie's right-wing allegory of Reagan-Bush era know-nothingism and historical blindness. As another commenter put it, ""this is a movie for people who voted for Reagan"" or for the Bushes. Overall, it's a remarkable document of Reagan-Bush era dominant thinking.So the basic situation with this movie is not too difficult to grasp: the movie is skillfully made and acted, and the wide success of its right-wing plot and message demonstrates that the American movie-going public largely shares these right-wing views.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

There are plenty of great movies but only one is on the top for me. Forrest Gump.

The plot covers like 40 something years of a man, history events included in such a way that you just have to love it. There is no other way. I think that everybody would like to be a Forrest Gump in some way he is something like a working class hero of the 90's.

Sincere and Sweet,"There aren't many movies that have penetrated the subconscious of the American zeitgeist as intensely as Gump, and it's not hard to see why. It's a film that deftly mixes nearly every genre into one epic tale, yet never shies away from the importance of small moments. But with this much love, cynicism and (some deserved) scorn aren't far behind: terms like ""on-the nose"" and ""syrupy sweet"" come to mind. But what's the advantage of this cynicism when it's so rewarding to just sit back and enjoy? At its core, Gump is pure Hollywood magic that deserves to be treasured. Essentially a biopic of a fictional character, Gump is first-person-perspective storytelling with a protagonist who sees much but perceives littleat least not in the same way we do. Swimming in historical fiction and even magical realism, he impacts American history: presidents are met, classic songs are heard, Vietnam wars are foughtyet Forrest's gaze is set on one thing: love. It's silly and whimsical, yet consistently surprising to see Forrest navigate through life with such sincerity and tenacity. Lest we neglect how technically impeccable the film is. The aesthetic is simplistic and gorgeous, and the effects (missing limbs, altered historical footage) are light years ahead of what they should be. But these things are rarely mentioned because they aren't the point. Zemeckis wants the movie to be the same as its hero: simple, random, sincere. Gump's unconditional love, overwhelming kindness, and naïve determination got him wherever he needed to be, and that journey leaves him and us in stitches, while never abandoning hope. Manipulative? Maybeor maybe it's just great filmmaking.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"The movie is a film adaptation of the book ""Forrest Gump""",When I first saw this movie I didn't appreciate it like I do now. I think it may have been because I was so young when I first saw it. Just recently I saw the movie again. What an amazing story and moving meaning. That movie teaches you so much about life and the meaning of it. That life isn't as bad as most people make it seem. That an innocent man can impact so many lives with his innocence. The meaning of the movie to me is that everyone needs to have a better outlook on life. That we need to appreciate more of the little things and not let the big things hold us back. That truly although life may throw us trials and tribulations like a box of chocolates but that we have to just bite into it and get through it even if we don't like it. That we all need to hold true to our values and not sink into a place that feels like there's no hope... I just love this movie.

A Tasty Box of Chocolates,"The movie Forrest Gump is a very unusual, but a great, film. Each of the four story elements of characterization, plot development setting, and themes are very effectively presented. It was very popular when it first came out, and people even now still discuss it, considering it as a modern classic. In the first eighteen days, it took $100 million in only American cinemas, more than any other film made by Paramount Pictures before. The movie was first written as a novel by an American author Winston Groom. The movie was made in 1994, directed by an American director Robert Zmeckis.The story has an odd setting. It is set in a small fictional town in Alabama, but also the whole world. The filmmaker used this to represent his theme of 'everyman'. It has a long time setting. The story covers several generations from 1950s to 1990s. By covering of the world's time of losing innocence, as at the same time presenting Forrest as a symbol of innocence, he shows how the world has changed during the time.The main character Forrest is an extraordinary person. He, played by Tom Hanks, is born with polio. He needed braces for his legs when he was young. He also has a low IQ of 70. He is unusual. He is different from other people in a lot of special ways. Forrest Gump represents all Humanity, as a kind of modern-day 'Everyman'. He is judged by his intelligence and appearance by other people. This leads to another theme of the story. Judging a person by one thing about them cannot explain the person. The filmmaker uses this astonishing character to show the viewers the surrealism. The events go under realism, but all the things that happen to him cannot happen to one person. This intentionally unrealistic characterization is used to give us the message that we are all human.Other characters are also very interesting. His mom Mrs. Gump, played amazingly by Sally Field, tries really hard for him to find the best of him. She is willing to do anything for Forrest, and she always stands up for him. She symbolizes good motherhood. Forrest's beautiful girlfriend named Jenny, also his first and the only friend in the school, later becomes his wife. She was the victim of physical and sexual abuse by her father when she was young. Her childhood was like living hell for her. In the film played fantastically by Robin Wright, Jenny plays one of the major roles in the movie, contributing to the plot development and the theme of acceptance and tolerance.The mood of the film changes as Jenny comes to find Forrest, and then just leaves him alone again. The film slowly develops its high points. The first day of school is one. It is important because it shows that even little kids judge him by his looks. Later he goes to Vietnam and gets involved in the war. When he runs the entire breadth of America, the plot reaches one of its highest points with some humor in it.There isn't only one theme in the film Forrest Gump. ""Life is like a box of chocolate,"" he says. You don't know what you're given, until you've opened your chocolate. Additionally, whatever you're given in life, you should always try to achieve your personal best. It also makes the viewers wonder about the idea of destiny and choices in life. The film has a universal theme of acceptance and tolerance. He says, ""Stupid is as stupid does."" He might not fully understand what he's really saying, but the filmmaker intends the viewers to understand. It really means that it is not stupid to be unintelligent, but it's stupid to judge people on actions, not reputation, and to name-call them. The film tells us what it's really like to be a human. It expresses another universal experience of how we're more alike than not alike.Overall, I would say this movie is terrific. It doesn't only tell us about its themes and meaning of life but make us think about them as well. Both the actors' incredible performances, and the stimulating script writing make this movie so magnificent. The movie has won 6 Academy Awards including best picture. I strongly recommend you watch this movie and or read the original novel. It is important to understand what it's like to be a human, what it's like to be different, what it means to accept and understand each other and I'm sure you'll really like the movie too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Might be the only movie that can make you cry and laugh out loud at the same time.There are many morals of the story, but one that seems universal is to make the most of life with what you got. Not everyone is privileged or handed things easily and people have different unique traits, strengths, and weaknesses, but you can at least make the most out of your life even if you have disadvantages. Forrest doesn't make excuses and does what he can.Wish they still made Oscar winners like this. Miss the good old days of pure filmmaking.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Ability,"Spoiler Warning!!!! Forrest Gump is in reality a movie that covers a plethora of issues for example racial issues with the KKK and Black Panthers, drugs, peace, war, and finally disability. For this review I would like to touch on the disability portion. I must first say that even though this movie is mostly comedic it can still be said that it is partially accurate. In the beginning Forrest breaks off his braces to help with his scoliosis but broke them off to run away from bullies. Yet even though he had this disability against him he still had the ability to do it. So in reality this movie begins by saying that it's more about ability. I can prove this point further by saying that he became a war veteran with a medal of honour and also managed to become a millionaire and then evidently a successful father, even though Forrest was put in the situation that was impossible, and even if it was for comedic purposes it is much deeper, yet he still managed to come out ahead. Mostly a duration of the movie it is asked if Forrest is stupid, now Forrest doesn't like it and even though he may have a low IQ he still manages to pull through in the long run. This is also the case for Lt. Dan, he is in Vietnam harmed in battle and winds up with his legs amputated, later in the movie he gets prothstetics and is able to walk again, he also ends up being a millionaire because of his success in the shrimp industry. It's not that he is in need because he is disabled but is able to help because he is able. So in reality Forrest Gump isn't necessarily a film about specifically disability or otherwise it is something that shows how much of an ability you have whether or not you have a disability from birth or war or some other thing. It takes a will to do something and this is why I would give this movie a 9/10 because of its uplifting story and some form of motivation to do something with your life.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I wish I had shoes like that. My feet hurt . Mama always said there's an awful lot you can tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going,where they've been. I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes.Mama said they'd take me anywhere . Gum She said they was my magic shoes. All right, Forrest, Open your eyes now Let's take a little walk around.How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gum,as strong as I've ever seen.But his back's as crooked as a politician.But we're going to straighten him right up, aren't we, Forrest? Forrest! Now, when I was a baby,Mama named me after the great Civil War hero.General Nathan Bed ford Forrest. General Nathan Bed ford Forrest. She said we was related to him in some way.What he did was,he tarted up this club called the Clue Clue Klan.They'd all dress up in their robes and their bed sheets and act like a bunch of ghosts or spooks or something.They'd even put bed sheets on their horses and ride around.And, anyway, that'show I got my name-- Forrest Gum.Mama said the Forrest part was to remind me that sometimes we all do things that, well,that just don't make no sense.This way. Hold on. Ugh! All right.What are y'all staring at? Haven't you ever seen a little boy with braces on his legs before ?

Going trough the motions,"The first time I saw Forrest Gump, I loved it. On the second time around, I saw how terrible it actually is. There is not as much a plot as an idea. It's like watching ""Look who's talking"", where the writers thought that simply having a baby talk was plot enough to fill a hour and a half.You all know the premise of this movie. The life of a retarded man in 20th century America. He does a lot of unusual things, which all turn out ok and trigger key historical events. This is funny. Then the writers see that two hours have passed, and have to conjure an ending. They kill off Forrest's wife and have Forrest give a tearjerking speech like only Tom Hanks can. This is uplifting. There. Now go home and feel good.Some of my friends saw the film as plain all-american propaganda. In my opinion however, the film doesn't really take itself seriously enough to just be a vehicle for the American dream. In fact, Forrest Gump could have been a biting satire. As the audience is clearly supposed to laugh at Forrest's improbable success, the film could be seen as a parody. Mostly all the humour comes from the fact that the audience knows that the events are the exact opposite of what would happen in reality. The filmmakers could even have argued that recent history is so insane, that the events could as well have been caused by someone like Mr. Gump. The movie, however, doesn't have the guts to have lean to the right or left. Forrest's pivotal role in history is treated as a mere light-hearted gimmick, omitting all the possibilities for actual commentary.The film tries to have it both ways in many other scenes as well. Apparently it´s not PC to bully Forrest, but on the other hand the audience is supposed to laugh at his antics. Forrest as both a war hero and a peace advocate exemplifies this problem. This isn't being ironic, impartial or open to interpretation. Especially concerning the Vietnam war, the writers have obviously not wanted to offend anyone, now matter how derivative it will look. In the end, it only comes off as having nothing to say.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump Film Rieview,"My suggestions to the film, Forrest Gump review are about the irony of this story, the setting, the characterization, the plot, and the theme. I thought this movie tells us about everyone's life and my opinion of this movie was that I liked it very much and it is very enjoyable to watch. You won't get bored and the plot of the movie always develops. In the movie Forrest Gump, the setting is rather weird because it is set in a small fictional town in Alabama. That is where Forrest starts. Later in the movie the story takes place in the whole world. This means that he represents every human being. The time setting is between the 1950s and 1980s. This time was important to the U.S. history because it was after the World War II and it was a new start for the people of the United Sates of America. Another example of everybody or universal is the character Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump. I think he is a very good actor and the role suits him. When Forrest Gump was a little child he had polio and a low level of IQ. His IQ was around 70. He lived with his mom in a big farm outside the town. They had no money so Forrest's mother used their big house as a hotel. On the first day of school, he met Jenny. Forrest thought she was a nice-looking young girl and fell in love. Another important point of him is that he had polio and everyone rejected him except for Jenny. He had polio as he was born and it is when the legs aren't strong enough to hold you and he had to wear braces. Sally Fields plays Mrs. Gump, she is Forrest's mother and cares a great deal about Forrest. After Forrest grows old she got a sickness and died with an old age after Forrest becomes popular. She was a very good mother to Forrest. Robin Wright as Jenny lives alone with her father in a very small house also outside of the town and her father abuses her very often so she tries to stay away from the house as long as possible. In the movie, Gary Sinise plays Lt. Dane. He was a super realistic character, meaning that he was almost too realistic for this movie. He plays his role really well and my opinion to him is that he is the best actor from this movie. Bubba, he is a fascinating unrealistic character. Myketti Williamson plays Bubba in the movie and was the best friend of Forrest in the movie. He is the meaning of true friendship. The one thing that is unrealistic is that Forrest Gump cannot meet all the presidents of America and all the celebrities that he saw in the movie and run around the world without any reason. It is rather a symbolic meaning. The plot of this movie is very interesting. As time passes the plot development raised always higher and higher. One of the themes of this movie is that the main character, Forrest Gump, represents everybody's life. One of the quotes that he said was ""life is like a box of chocolates."" It simply means that you will never know what will happen in life because you never know what piece of chocolate you will take out. Sometimes you take a good one out or sometimes you take one out you don't like that much. The other interesting quote was ""stupid is as stupid does."" This quote's significance means that you should not judge someone on their reputation but on their actions or it is stupid to call people stupid. This movie was a really good movie. I would rate it really high because the plot of this movie is really interesting and the director must have really thought about it. It would be a really hard movie to make. I think Forrest Gump is a movie that everyone has to watch because you will see how everyone's life is like. The plot is really interesting because it has a big increase all the time. I like that the plot development of this movie was like this. I really recommend this film to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump (1994) review,"Forrest Gump (1994) is an awesome and breathtaking film directed by Robert Zemeckis. This is an exceptionally touching film with a great cast, excellent choice of music and a thoroughly pleasing narrative. Some of the dialogue in this film is now commonly quoted in everyday life which is a great achievement. It was a teeny bit long though, otherwise this film would have probably got a perfect scored.Despite Forest Gump's low IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for numerous of the most notable events in the late 20th century. without trying hard just other might do, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley how to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years.Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest during a remarkable array of historical events and people.In fact, nothing is quite pursued to its logical conclusion, which makes the film more a triumph of style than content. Nevertheless this is certainly what it is. Gump is not so much a measure of its times, as a benign reflection upon them, nearly but not quite through the eyes of its lovable protagonist. The film goes through all the emotions but does not appeal on any of them long enough to trouble anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I would put him in just above them but just below the greats.Fourthly, how the film follows and depicts American culture through his life, and cleverly entwines his simple experiences within important historical context is captivating and endearing, sad and funny.

So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A Great Document of the Second Half of the Century,"This film is such a great document of many events that happened during my lifetime.  Forrest reminds me a little bit of the childlike innocence set against the backdrop of the turmoil and cynicism that permeated the country during the latter half of the 20th century.  He was a simple man that was thrown into extraordinary circumstances and faced them with an innocence that many people no longer have.  However, while Forrest represented the innocence of that era, Jenny represented the harsh reality.  Jenny's character was pretty much shaped by the sexual, physical and mental abuse she suffered as a child.  We see her move from relationship to relationship and become involved in drugs, all the time growing up a very lonely person. All this comes to a head as she contracts the black plague of the last 20 years, AIDS.

A Marvel at Human Relationships in the Modern Era,"The tale of Forrest Gump has always been awe-inspiring. In my youth, I would curl up on the couch with the family and watch it religiously. We would quote it, laugh, and reminisce of our favorite parts.Growing up, I have come to realize that the ambition that Tom Hanks portrays as Forrest is definitely something to be desired. I always connected with his character and never truly understood why. It wasn't the low IQ. I am quite intelligent. It wasn't what he accomplished. I have only done a handful of things, none of which are noteworthy. So reviewing this film as an adult, I realized I was watching it through a different pair of eyes. At first I thought the movie had changed. No... I had. The reason why I connected so much with Forrest are two-fold.First, his desire for strong relationships. There were so many people that shunned him and hated upon him, much of which I can relate to. However, throughout the film, we remember his relationships. The love he has for the character Jenny is so strong, it keeps him loyal throughout his entire life, despite always taking second to someone or something else. He knew what his heart wanted and waited patiently for his time. His relationship with his ""mama"" is definitely on to be desired. Sally Field brought a nurturing side to her son who already had shortcomings from childhood. Yet, she always used positive reinforcement to encourage him and build him up. His relationship with his Army buddy Bubba was something truly remarkable. In times of hardships, a man who he barely knew, he risked his life for. Granted, throughout training they did get to know some about each other, but the fact that Bubba treated Forrest like an equal is something so commendable and it makes me want to be a better person like that. Forrest's relation ship with Lt. Dan was, albeit, an unhealthy one from the start, but even though Dan was a loner, gave up on life, and despised Forrest for saving him in Vietnam, he ended up living a full life with his new wife, who could see past his disability and truly love him for who he was underneath.These days we don't see people behaving this way anymore. Almost like respect is beneath us. I will treat a custodian the same way I treat a President. People say respect is earned. No... respect is given. It doesn't matter who you are, what matters is who you are. Within. I know that last statement may sound redundant, but I'm sure some of you (hopefully all of you) can see the meaning for what it's worth.Secondly, Forrest's financial gains. Throughout his life, he accumulated a substantial amount of wealth. The greatest thing? He didn't let it change him. He was the same Forrest he was as a child as he was after his accomplishments throughout his amazing life. There was no greed. There was no revenge. There was no backstabbing. There was no hate. Just love. All he did throughout the film... was love.It is because of my thoughts on the film that truly make me reflect and want to be more like Forrest. Despite hardships, disabilities, and hate promoted everywhere he went, he rose above it all to maintain his self-respect and his dignity. He chose not to let outside forces change who he was within. I love him for that.To Tom Hanks, should he ever read this review: You did a splendid job. I wish words could express how much I truly enjoyed your portrayal of the great Forrest Gump, but all you need to know is that, as a child, it brought me joy and laughter. As an adult, it did it again, just in different ways. I commend you and I thank you.I guess it turns out that life is like a box of chocolates...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Sometimes American Movies Are Like a Box of Gooey Chocolates, and Gump is Pure Sap: One of the Silliest Movies to Win Best Picture","There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who dig Forrest Gump, and those who don't. I don't. If ""Forrest Gump"" is truly viewed as some kind of inspirational cinematic experience, then America is in a lot of trouble. Forrest Gump is no masterpiece of cinema, not even by a long-shot. It is largely a formulated overly sentimental contrivance that simply plays too well into American saccharine tastes, mostly pop melodrama for the sake of pop melodrama. This was obviously made for the same audience that likes ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Lucky You"".Certainly, I don't have a problem with the idea of a feeble-minded main character from which to tell a story. (""Rain Man"", a similar idea, is a far superior story to and much more real than the silliness of ""Gump"".) I will concede Hanks' portrayal of Forrest is no less than brilliant, and he was deserving of the Academy Award for Best Actor in 1994. But was this film really deserving of Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Writing? Is this film really in the same league as ""Schindler's List"", ""Ghandhi"", ""The Hurt Locker"", and ""Platoon""? I don't think so.A contrived stooge, a late 20th century throw-back to Lenny of ""Of Mice and Men"" (""Tell me about the rabbits, George""), enmeshed in a series of sentimentalized vignettes is nothing more than contrived farce. Does Gump represent the American ideal or fictionalized empty-headed-ness? Forrest Gump only mirrors American's insatiable appetite for the overly sentimental. Instead of telling a true human story, such as ""Rain Man"", about the struggles of a man verging on feeble-mindedness, the filmmakers decided to sentimentalize him and put him into the most ridiculous and unbelievable of situations. Because of the fantastical nature of the entire story, I think ""Gump"" does a disservice to those with intellectual disabilities, although I will admit it does so inadvertently. ""Rain Man"" I think achieves quite the opposite.So many of the scenes in this movie made no sense. In the opening sequence when young Forrest's legs are in braces and, inspired by the ""girl next door"", he begins running down a Midwest dirt road, and his braces magically come off. Oh brother. Only Hollywood could imagine something that rings of a bad ""Saturday Evening Post"" illustration from the 1950's. Not even Norman Rockwell would have painted something quite so contrived. Of course the ""running theme"" will recur toward the end of the the film. Later, despite his feeble-mindedness, he's drafted into the army where he puts his rifle together faster and better than anyone in training. He's a feeble-minded genius. Maybe an idiot-savant?During the course of much of the film, Gump ends up involved in the most unlikely of situations. He plays football under a legendary college coach, goes to Vietnam, wins a congressional medal, meets John F Kennedy, becomes a ping-pong champion, meets John Lennon, informs on the Watergate burglars, and ends up investing his ping-pong winnings into the Apple Computer company. And then goes on a pointless ""run"" where all these people run after him. Or maybe this last part is realistic. Not about Forrest running but that people would follow. Obviously everybody followed Gump to the box office. And then to the Academy Awards. It's a wonder the filmmakers didn't have him take the next logical step and have him run for president. Raymond Babbitt (the autistic character from ""Rain Man"" played by Dustin Hoffman) could be his running mate.The only saving grace of the film is some of the Vietnam sequences, and his relationship with Lut. Dan played by Gary Sinese, who is the other standout talent of the film. Gump's tour of duty and his relationship with Dan were far more substantive than all the rest of the movie put together. I think it would have been far more interesting and insightful if the story was about a feeble-minded man forced to fight in Vietnam rather than adding all the other asinine episodes that made me say to myself, ""Oh come on..."" And I liked aspects of Gump's relationship with Dan, and I wished that had been more developed rather than Gump popping up in high spots of American history. When Gump reports the Watergate burglary, I just about lost my popcorn.The recurring theme of ""Gump"" is ""life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."". As I have never liked most of the candies in those boxes (I always end up with the slimy gooey ones), I guess I am not the right viewer to appreciate the wonders of ""Forrest Gump"". I typically avoid those boxes of candies just for that reason. I want something that has a little more meat to it, a little more realism, and a little more honesty. Not just gooey caramel.

An incredible film,"'Forrest Gump' is one of those movies that will blow you away from your living room, and into the world of the title character. Tom Hanks does a superb job in acting as the simple-minded man Forrest Gump whose positive look on life and whose kind friendliness will grasp your emotion. Jenny, Lieutenant Dan, and even Bubba are all characters that are well-done enough to blow you away. This movie is truly a classic, and I would personally recommend it to anyone. 'Forrest Gump' is not in the least bit like any other movie I have seen, and though some parts are very sad, happiness amounts in the end. 'Forrest Gump' is a true cinematic masterpiece.Rating: PG-13 for drug content, some sensuality, and war violence",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"A man named Forrest Gump tells his life story while sitting on a bench. You see him on amazing adventures, each one different from the last.","Awesome movie! This is my favorite movie. The story, the soundtrack and the actors (Tom Hanks is excellent in this role)is very well composed. Although Forrest Gump is considered ""dumb"", he manages to do great thing with his life. A classic, definitely watch it! 10 out of 10. A lot of laughs, serious moments, sad parts, and interesting scenes combined into a jumble of greatness. Forrest does overcome many obstacles, which makes this movie even greater. A classic in my opinion. If you have ever considered watching the movie, pop it in, sit down and prepared to be mesmerized by this spectacular movie.

Forrest Gump is one of the most delightful movies of the 1990's!!!,Forrest Gump is one of the most delightful movies of the 1990's. This movie has it all and delivers it all in a manor that will captivate your imagination and will pull the strings of every sense you have. Tom Hanks delivers one of the best performances of his life and brings Forrest Gump to life in so many ways. If you are a big fan of Being There with Peter Sellers then you know the direct link between the two movies. Anything is possible and that is exactly what is delivered in one of my favorite movies of all time. The cast is great and everyone plays their part in this epic movie. I saw this in the box-office eight times and cried every single time and I still do. Great movie and amazing cast! If you have never seen this movie do so today.

An amazing sweet story of a stupid man....,"Watched Forrest Gump .... It's beautiful. It's just amazing. A concept very few movies have successfully stood up to....It's the story of a stupid person named Forrest Gump. But its not just a stupid comedy to be laughed at and forgotten. It makes you see the world through the eyes of the stupid completely innocent Forrest. You see death, the evils of war, corruption, jealousy, self righteousness, greed, wealth, frustration, success and the world. But you see all of it almost without reaction. Cause you see all of these through Gump's eyes, through the eyes of a stupid man child and his brain doesn't work like me and you, he is different.... That's what makes the movie so special....Ã°Å¸ËÅ  Talking about other stuff, they keep everything simple, no special effects nothing. Just plain old good music at the right time....

"This movie deserves a nice comment, but not a summary.","The moment I saw that Tom Hanks made a movie called Forrest Gump, I knew it was about some person's life, as all movies whose names are the name of a person.But there was something different about Forrest Gump... This shocked me a lot, it was just different than other movies, and I could not figure out why.There is no doubt about this: Tom Hanks best performance. (In my opinion..) I think nobody could have done a better job than Hanks, because he was simply spectacular.This movie was so good, because while watching it, you get to like Forrest, and you don't want anything bad to happen to him, and you feel good when he does something right, or when he gets good things, even by luck.It also had a bit of comedy, which I think it was nice... (As a matter of fact, I think the little comedy parts of this movie were funnier than the whole Austin Powers movie).Forrest Gump really got into me.. It's a feeling that is a little hard to explain.. But if you watch it carefully and paying a lot of attention you'll probably find out how good this movie is, and how real things are.. This movie could have been a true story.. After all, nobody knows if there is someone out there just like Forrest Gump.When I finished watching this movie, I knew it would definitely win both the best Actor and best Movie awards.This movie deserves a 10/10 score.. more than a lot of other movies that are rated higher than this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The simplicity of a man is take to a whole new level. I just think this is one of the best movies ever.The Script is flawless, incredible, the way it takes U.S.A history and adapt it to a simple mentally retarded man of the south it's just overwhelming. The story is great, and it's so powerful it can take you to a whole new level of identifying with the character.Tom Hanks make one of the best if not the bes performance I've ever seen. and Liuetenant Dan it's another great actor. Incredible strong acting, I love also the photography. Probably one of the most flawless movies ever.Forrest Gump is definitively one of my (if not my) favorite movie of all time, it is emotionally very powerful.

He changed their life,"Before I came to this site, this movie was my all-time favorite movie. But since then I saw many movies that changed my whole perspective of movie making, and truly many changed my life (in the way I should live and think) - so I grow apart from Forrest.Before a month or so I was in class and we had a discussion about a man's will's and boundaries. It came to me in a surprise to see on the TV screen an example of the discussed subject - I saw Forst run. Why did he ran? He doesn't know, he's just running - but people found meaning to his acts and ran with him - and he changed their life's.I felt like crying. I feel like crying.""Forrest Gump"" as a truly great, deep and emotional look of life. It tells us a story of a great life but accidentally breaks our hearts.

The Good & The Bad Of Forrest Gump,"Wow, I found a number of ""good"" and ""bad"" in this movie, too much to go into detail here without writing what looks like a novel, so I'll condense my thoughts with notes here. I don't expect many to agree with me but overall I found this good very good storytelling and a film that stays with you.The GOOD: 1 - a totally unique story back when it was released and still that way, unlike anything else I've seen; 2 - an involving story. You really care about the lead character ""Forrest Gump,"" who is magnificently played by Tom Hanks; 3 - the story has a good combination of drama, action and humor; 4 - numerous memorable scenes that you'll never forget, especially if you've seen this more than once; 5 - an excellent 1960s soundtrack; 6 - very interesting characters throughout, with solid performances from Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Myketti Williamson and Sally Field; 7 - a realistic look at some of the unflattering people of the 1960s who were not all ""peace and love;"" 8 - a sweet, tear-jerking ending.The BAD: 1 - The Liberal attitude that having children out of wedlock is just fine is not a good message. (""You didn't do anything wrong, Forrest,"" says Wright, after he discovered he fathered her child out-of-wedlock); 2 - a blatant anti-gun agenda in which every political shooting is duly noted, along with yet another cheap shot made against Richard Nixon, Hollywood's favorite villain; 3 - The Lord's name in vain used 21 times within a 49-minute period, mostly GDs by Sinise.Overall, the ""good"" far outweighs the ""bad,"" making this a truly memorable movie and one that is fairly unfairly blasted by a lot of ""critics."" Maybe they didn't like the '60s radicals portrayed in a negative light. That's too bad. I owned this DVD and got rid of it. I'm sorry I did because I'd watch it again and I've seen it three times.

So, after I've done watching it, it was such an excellent movie. Forrest Gump, an idiot from Alabama, has witness many historical things. And he even met those presidents. And he even had his own shrimping company. And Tom Hanks did such a great performance, he has never done such a great performance in any other movie. And Robin Wright, played Jenny, which was Forrest's girlfriend, did a great job too. This movie is meaningful, it can give you a special message after you done watching it.

One of the best films of the 90's.,"""Mama always said that dyin' was a part of life. I sure wish it wasn't.""No matter what Tom Hanks does for the rest of his career, to me, he'll always be Forrest Gump. I mean that as a compliment. His role here was one of the best and most memorable that I've ever seen in a movie. I can't imagine another actor who could have played this character, and played him so well.Forrest's story will take you all across America, and beyond. You get to see a large part of recent American history through his eyes. It's extremely clever the way that Forrest's presence is weaved throughout so many iconic events and places. The man meets Presidents, inspires kings (of music), and lives the kind of life that most people would never even dream of. And he takes everyone watching along with him.Forrest Gump is so beloved, because it's so charming and heartbreaking and genuine. Even when it's at its most sentimental or sugary sweet, it's grounded in the kind of genuine human emotion that makes great movie experiences. You'll laugh and fight back tears, but you'll also think. This is one of the few movies that everyone should see, and that almost everyone will like.

He moves through life, pure by impulse, driven by love and everything just comes to him.

watch it to enjoy it,"hm I'm a little shocked at the level of hatred for this film.

Clever Yet Missing It's Purpose,"The clever yet disappointing thing about Forrest Gump, is that it's an obvious fantasy story. A story in which characters and the situations they're put in cannot possibly be real. Yet the story is told and acted as if it's an actual biography of a socially inept individual's life, who is successful with below average thinking faculties. Never revealing it's pure fantasy!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Overrated And Unbelievable,"The fact that a movie of this caliber is given such an overall high rating reflects the disintegrating state of our civilization. Tom Hanks, as always, is obnoxious and unlikeable. How this guy garners such critical acclaim is totally baffling. It's almost like he didn't cut his acting teeth on the immortal ""Bosom Buddies."" Oh, wait, he has become a brash public believer in the impossible Oswald-acted-alone fairy tale. That always helps careers....To anyone that has a loved one with development difficulties, or has worked with handicapped people, Forest Gump is a pathetic and unrealistic caricature. Hanks's voice for the character is grating and unlike any I've ever heard, in the south or from any developmentally delayed individual. What kind of ridiculous accent is that? Even Rosie O'Donnell's laughable performance as a mentally challenged person was more believable than Hanks.The plot is beyond preposterous. All those famous people, all the crucial events of the times (at least by Hollywood historical standards), and this one very challenged guy just happens to be in the right place at the right time, over and over again. I love fantasy and far fletched plots, but this is not remotely possible under any circumstances.Again, those with personal life experiences in this area, know all too well just how horribly the handicapped and developmentally delayed are treated by all too many ""good"" and ""upright"" citizens. Gump seemed to avoid most of that, when he wasn't altering history. This film makes a mockery of those whose real disabilities make every day a real challenge. It's typical Hollywood, but even worse than usual. Maybe with another actor in the lead, who could give even a somewhat acceptable performance, this film might have been better.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The problem with trying to fit a movie into a type-slot,"I know many people who have gone to see movies and fail to grasp what is certainly the underlying subtleties the writers, producers and actors are trying to convey. I read the derisive comments on this movie and realize the impossibility of helping these people see what they are blind to. They look at 'Forrest Gump' and think ""a movie about a guy who was not too bright and stumbled through life with great luck"", they watch 'A Field of Dreams' and think it is a movie about baseball..... <<SIGH>> Some of us just have to be smacked in the head with it I guess. And please, don't think I subscribe to the new-age physco-babble sensitivity training induced brain-damaged politically-corrected point of view. Gump, and movies such as it, are not meant to be pulled apart scene-by-scene. They are works in full and as such can only be truly understood when viewed as that. Works that try to show lifes experiences and the journey that is life are often hard to tolerate, much less understand if we become so hardened and cynical the we see only the entertainment value in them. It is like going to the La Boheme and seeing only a sad story about poor people, or going to see a Ballet and remembering only that you saw some people dancing about. I you get it, nobody need explain it to you, if you do not get it, no amount of explanation will ever make it clear.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Overrated,"Forrest Gump is a bad, bad movie.  It is an idiot going around falling backwards into heroism, fortune, and friendship in a very unrealistic fashion.  It has no importance to society whatsoever. It adds nothing to one's personal enlightenment and does not make you think in the least.  I suppose it is supposed to be a ""feel good"" film but it is too long and boring to be that.  The fact that it has gotten so much praise notwithstanding  winning Best Picture just makes me hate this film even more.  If it is a feel good movie, let it be a feel good movie, but don't try to pass it off as some monument of film making and give it the same award as Schindler's List received and Saving Private Ryan got screwed out of.

He is the All-American guy. It made you feel you were there in 60s when we landed on the moon, when Richard Nixon robbed the Watergate, and when African-American were making the mark on America. However despite it's emotional and innocent events it had some moments like whe Jenny (god bless her soul even though she had done wrong) was a prostitute, when JFK, George Wallace, Lennon, and more were shot, and even when Forrest's mom had to sleep with a school principal so Forrest could make it in life brang out the dark and dirty points of our nation and leaves feeling a little guilty for how society is.

Not my favorite but the Best I've watched so far,"This is the only film for which I can use the word ""Beautiful"" without any hesitation. 6 Academy Awards, $677,387,716 in box office & 8.8 rating in IMDb combined don't say it all.Tom Hanks portrayed the role of Forest Gump more than perfectly. Other supporting actor and actresses weren't that memorable. But that's for the sake of the story. Robert Zemeckis probably taught us how to direct. Hanks & Zemeckis did the best job of their career.Film editing was flawless. They shot the film in different locations and every single one of them added a new level of greatness to the film. The musics weren't much noticeable. Also weren't the visual effects. Which is actually a big success, because I thought they didn't use any visual effect.The story is simple, plain and for some mysterious reason also sad. Forest Gump will teach you how to live life. Miracles and shits both happen for a definite reason. You'll find out what's your destiny is, but not before you fulfill it. Just float around like a feather and you'll be OK.

Epic Top 5 Film,"I have seen this movie at least a dozen times - likely even more. For me, it is a top 5, and could easily be tied for #1 with the other 4!The beauty of the film is found in Forrest Gump's innocence and purity and the way he deals with adversities and others, especially being raised in a conservative, white-powered, pre-60s Alabama culture. He does not see color, race, intelligence or gender - partially thanks to the way his mother raised him and painted a simple picture of life analogies for him to understand everything. He somehow manages to retain that innocence through some very difficult times. As he is picked on as a child, as a Vietnam soldier then veteran, as a college graduate of the late Sixties, and as an adult struggling through friendships, love, death, money and life challenges. Anyone watching should be able to personally relate to some of the various periods and parts of Forrest's life.I would not be doing this review justice if I did not mention the skillful and seamless blending of music, action, and detailed costumes that lent itself to making this film epic.

I haven't yet gone in to a discussion like this, but should the moment arise, I will definitely defend it, as it is one of my all time favorites. The thing that always gets me is the innocence in which Forrest sees the world. He doesn't really know what he is doing or saying, yet to us he makes a huge difference in the world. On the other side of the coin, Jenny makes her own choices. Choices that lead to a complicated life and an ultimately predictable demise. Unlike other characters that seem to have a positive impact on Forrest's life, Jenny always seems to be the light in his life, despite being a completely dislikeable person at one point of the movie. Once again the naive Gump doesn't judge Jenny's bad decisions, as he still sees that lovely, but damaged young girl he met when he was a child.As far as the movie making goes, FG presents us with a career defining performance from Tom Hanks, as he handles the emotional conflicts very well in the movie. In a midst of strong supporting performances, for me Gary Sinise steals the show as Lieutanent Dan Taylor, a man whose changes in life end up being an inspiration. Zemeckis's directing is precise, and Roth's script is very involving: In the end though, I think Alan Silvestri's delicate score is what accounts for at least 50% of the movie's dramatic effect.1994 will always be a year I will fondly remember as a great cinematic year. It features 3 Jim Carrey comedies that cemented his place in movie history, one of the greatest animated movies of all time, and 3 best picture nominees that would become worshiped movies. Whether it's with Pulp Fiction's violent world, or Shawshank Redemption's gritty prison vision, or even the endearing drama story that is Forrest Gump, this is top notch cinema.Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Maybe you have to be American...,"I really don't rate Tom Hanks as an actor, I think he's highly inconsistent, and often his acting style is off-putting to me. Now put Tom Hanks doing a stupid voice, playing a ridiculous character, taking up all the screen time, in a really long film. It's like torture. I was willing this film towards the end. I didn't feel any genuine drama, the Vietnam scenes especially leaving me cold.What I liked was the Zemeckis stylistic touches. It's got a nice whimsical feel, and just enough lighthearted humour to keep it afloat. For this film to work on any real level though, you would have to connect with the central character, which I just can't do. It's a very average story really focusing on one character who has very little personality. In terms of film making, it's just OK.Six out of Ten.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
This will break hearts,"First off let me be fair about the movie...nice special effects. Now with that said sit back and let me rip the hell out of this horrible movie. I personally think Paramount and Robert Zemekis were handing out their own batch of Jim Jones Kool Aid at every theater in America when this was out.From start to finish I dont think I have ever seen a movie (I say movie, because this is not a film) that is more predictable, melo-dramatic, or sterotypicable. How in the world this dreck won best picture is beyond me. I personally believe the Academy was doing Speilberg a favor and awarded his buddy Zemekis for making an overblown bad film. Lets face it if this movie only grossed 60 million it would have been cosidered a failure and would have won best special effects and thats IT!!! In my opinion this is Ishtar part 2, without Isabelle Adjani. This movie was a forshadow of things to come from Zemekis. Contact, Cast Away, What lies Beneath; although better films than Forrest Gump just proves Zemekis has sold his soul to the BIG HOLLYWOOD garbage machine.

A men can do everything in which believes,"I was long ago planing to watch this movie and when my lecturer from university told us in a lecture about him I finally decided to watch it. It's a great movie. Really touchable and inspiring story.Forrest Gump is nothing special, they don't even believe he is able to graduate school like normal kids, but his mother does. She never gives up on him and support him. She is the exact parent which a child like Forrest needs to grown up right. Without any expectations of big results Forrest gets beyond his possibilities and started running though his life really fast. Even though he is not with a special intellect potential he achieves everything that he wants. He is doing what he wants in the moments, when he is enjoying it and he succeed. Nothing stops him to get what he want, people's opinion is not important for him.This movie is example for that there are no limits or restrictions for what a person can or can't do. When you want to do something you just start doing it, because life is short and we may loose our chance while we are wondering when is the right time to begin. There is no more right time than the exact moment - now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Tom Hanks at his very best,"Forrest Gump is Tom Hanks best performance, This is NOT up for debate. It's the most Unbelievable believable film i think i ever did see, I watch Tom Hanks and i don't see him the 'Actor' in this role i just see the character that is Forrest Gump and to me this is a testament to Mr Hanks greatness. Forrest Gump makes my top 5 list of the greatest films i have seen and i have seen a million or so. This is just one of them films of only a few they i can watch over and over and it be as great as it always was. Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks are great duo but this is there very best to date. Perhaps Forrest Gump may not be Hanks best film because i believe that title is The Green Mile, Tom Hanks as an actor was a generation best and still continues to be great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
In the eyes of a 16 year old girl,"Forrest Gump Film Review by Ivy SmithIn the movie Forrest Gump, Tom Hanks portrays the main character Forrest, a simple man that is not very intelligent but has good intentions toward his mother (Sally Field) and best friend Jenny (Robin Wright). Throughout the movie Forrest tells the story of his life but since he doesn't know any better he was put into the middle of some major historical events that have happened from the 1950s - 1980s. This movie is like no other of the time of its release in 1994, still now in 2015 this movie is a favorite of many.We first see Hanks' character Forrest on a bus bench in Savannah, Georgia telling his story to a stranger that sat next to him. He begins his story at the beginning, him as a boy having to get braces for his legs. His story goes on and he meets Jenny on the bus when no one else would let him sit down. From that moment on Jenny and Forrest are the best of friends. One day bullies were chasing Forrest and Jenny said ""Run Forrest! Run!"" and then he started running and his leg braces broke off and he is a very fast child. After a while Forrest finds himself running away from bullies again and he runs straight across a football field and he gets a free ride into college.He goes to tell that he goes through many big historical events and some of those were school integration, he gets to meet President John F. Kennedy, The Vietnam War, he was on a TV show and met John Lennon a few months or so before he died, he inadvertently helps expose the Watergate scandal and many more events. He tells them through his mind and it seems all too innocent because of his low IQ. His relationship with Jenny continues and he keeps trying to save her but she keeps running away. Through Jenny's eyes you see the hippie movement, drug and alcohol abuse, her sleeping around, and a failed suicide attempt. Jenny cleans up and decided to go back to Forrest and stays with him and soon after she runs away again.Forrest Gump is based off of a book called Forrest Gump by Winston Groom in 1986. The book was more harsh than the movie so the film writers took off some of the edge and made it into a more lovable movie. They took out some of the adventures Forrest had because they were a little ridiculous. The movie took great special effects in how they put the actor Tom Hanks into different scenarios in time, such as being put into a video with John F. Kennedy and using special effects to take off Lt. Dan's (Gary Sinise) legs after the Vietnam war scenes.The movie won six Academy awards for Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role, Best Director, Best Visual Effects, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing. The movie was nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards. The film won three of them Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama, Best Director - Motion Picture, and Best Motion Picture - Drama. Forrest Gump was also nominated for six Saturn Awards and won two of them, Best Fantasy Film, and Best Supporting Actor. The movie is also on many lists and it mad #240 on the Greatest Movies of All Time list.I find the movie deserving of all the awards it got and being on all the lists it's on. The acting was great and i could really tell the actors were into the roles they were cast for. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job of playing a disabled man and getting the voice and actions right. I give this movie an 8 out of 10 stars only because it does jump around a tad bit but it works well in the terms how fast you have to go through his whole life. The movie is wonderful and i have watched it so many times with my family and friends. I always find something new when i watch it over again, just those little things you don't notice when you first watch it. I have always found that fascinating.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The best film in history,"Tom Hanks, hands down, gives one of the best performances by any actor. Ever. Forrest Gump is such a compelling, historically based, dramatic and even light hearted film that I believe is the greatest film of all time. Gary Sinise, or Lt. Dan, definitely should have won for Best Supporting Actor. He plays a man with no legs for more than half of the movie and he is such a harrowing character at large. Moreover, Forrest Gump, undoubtedly, has some of the best lines in movie history (Run Forrest Run, Life is like a box of chocolates, etc), but the morality behind the film is incredible. Forrest Gump, when he runs across the country for literally no reason, is such an inspirational moment in the film. What I enjoy most about Forrest Gump is that he unwittingly gets caught up in some of the most key moments in the 20th century. Watergate, Kennedy, Civil Rights, Vietnam, Alabama Football - he's there. And because Forrest is such a simple man, these scenes are that much more captivating. An absolute 10/10, Forrest Gump, driven by the once-in-a-lifetime performance by Tom Hanks, followed by a forceful performance by Gary Sinise, is the greatest film in history in my opinion. If you haven't watched it, you are missing out big time. Myself, it is one of those few movies that never gets old. Fantastic every time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Reactionary horse manure,"Politically, 'Forrest Gump' is the ultimate wolf in sheep's clothing, a deeply reactionary film that valorizes stupidity as akin to some sort of transcendental innocence. As embodied in the figure of the good-hearted simpleton, Forrest Gump (played by the ever-smarmy Tom Hanks), this movie encourages its audience to embrace quietism and noninvolvement as the best means to cope with modernity's horrors. Everyone involved with this monster should be ashamed of themselves. Ditto for the geniuses who showered this piece of dreck with honors. Worst irony of all: this awful film beat out the superb 'Shawshank Redemption' for Best Picture! Yikes!",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

That's where the paradox of Jenny comes into mind, where she seems to always want to find herself in a messed up world, she always comes back to the only man who never saw her for anything else than his best friend and the woman he loves... That is to me the essence of this movie, the power of Forrest Gump is that attraction, the feeling that you're watching an epic adventure trough the life of a simple man who never intended to be a great man but he became one without even knowing it... He lived for the one he loved, his mother, Jenny, Bubba and Lt. Dan... And Tom Hanks captured this essence... I truly believe this is one of the greatest movie of all time...

"""You said it all, man""","This is one of my favorite movies that I've ever seen. It's heartwarming, beautiful, charming, funny, and just overall great. The acting is superb, the story is excellent, and music is probably the best I've ever heard. Mostly because of the genius song selection for this movie. Every single song in this movie that you will hear(not including the original score)will perfectly some up the 50's - 90's era.A great thing about this movie is that the story centers around historic events like Vietnam, Watergate, and even includes famous people like JFK, LBJ, Elvis, and John Lennon. The movie perfectly captures these famous moments and people through the eyes Forrest Gump who simply was at the right place at the right time.Forrest Gump is an innocent tale about an innocent, loving man who gets sucked into America's history from the 1950's - 1990's. While going through these important moments of America's history, he is also trying to be with the woman he loves, Jenny. Jenny is an interesting character because her actions and her life are the exact opposite of Forrest's. Forrest is a person who wouldn't hurt a fly. He manages his life well, works hard, and has family values which make him a great person and therefore,the audience can easily fall in love with him. Jenny on other hand, is a person who can't seem to live her life. As a child she was abused by her father, she got kicked of college for appearing in a Playboy magazine, and her dream of becoming a country singer is pretty much destroyed because in the 70's she started taking drugs and the entire time she's being used or abused by every man that she meets, except Forrest.Thats the beauty of the film. You want these two to get together. You're rooting for the characters. And that's something hard to find in movies.Forrest Gump still stands the test of time even though it's already 15 years old. It's a classic movie that I enjoy watching whenever it's on TV. It offers a great story complete with great acting. If you haven't seen this movie yet, then what the hell are you doing?

"Not overrated, just people have no heart","After my father did a course during the which there was quite some talk about autism, how it works and such I finally got to see again this movie that I had seen only once at a very young age. There are several things (E.G. /MILD SPOILER/ the fact that Forrest is very good at Ping pong because he's able to focus on the ball) that suggest that Forrest is not stupid and retarded, more autistic. Which basically destroys all the accusations of the movie being a ""Sentimentalistic ode to stupidity and ignorance"".There are various things with which you can explain why ""Forrest Gump"" is truly one of the best movies ever. 1st is the acting, not only of Tom Hanks, but also of several other cast members, highlighting Gary Sinise. Another thing to praise is the music. Alan Silvestri truly was able to touch with this movie's music.Some consistent criticism is driven towards the story. The fact here is the problem with understanding that this is what they call ""Modern fable"", a story set nowadays that is meant to be touching and talks about what happened in that time, similarly to ""The legend of 1900"" or ""the curious case of benjamin button"". This genre seems to not be understood by a pretty consistent number of viewers, therefore receives a limited amount, but present amount of hatred.Then, when I understood that some haters of this movie are angry because it seems to have stolen the accademy award away from other movies such as the shawshank redemption and pulp fiction I understand that it's just unreasoned hatred.

Don't waste your time with this stupid movie.,"Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has an IQ of 75 and plays a role in many aspects of American history, everything from Elvis to Watergate to the smiley face to the integration of the University of Alabama.  The message of the movie is that if you are stupid and you always do as you are told, then great things will just fall into your lap.  The movie is beyond farfetched.  The movie is absolutely ridiculous and unbelievable.  The basic premise of the movie is ludicrous.  There is no way to make it work.  This movie is a real insult to the intelligence of the viewer.  Tom Hanks is totally obnoxious in this movie.  I never liked him anyway.The movie glorifies stupidity and treats us, the viewers, like we are stupid too.  When Forrest's mother says Forrest is named after General Nathan Bedford Forrest, we see a flashback of General Forrest.  When Forrest talks about Lieutenant Dan's (Gary Sinise) family, we see flashbacks of Lieutenant Dan's relatives.  I understand!  You don't have to show me!  The movie begins and ends with a feather drifting around, as if we are too stupid to get the message that Forrest drifts through his life aimlessly.  I get the point!  I don't need to see an actual feather!The soundtrack is irritating.  The songs keep breaking into the movie in a very annoying manner.  And they are so literal-minded!  When Forrest is running, we get `Running on Empty.'  When Forrest goes home, we get `Sweet Home Alabama.'  When Jenny (Robin Wright) walks out a door, we get `Don't You Love Her As She's Walking Out the Door.'Forrest's mother (Sally Field) does something absolutely despicable to keep Forrest in a school for which he is clearly not qualified.  Are we supposed to admire Mrs. Gump for her devotion to her son?  I do NOT admire her!The movie never even tries to explain how a person with an IQ of 75 somehow manages to graduate from high school and college and join the military. The movie expects us to simply accept this fact without question.  And what happened to Jenny's sisters?  The movie mentions them once and then conveniently forgets all about them.The only good thing about this movie is Gary Sinise.

These are the films the soceity needs,"I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and was moved. Wanted to watch few more movies of his type and tried ""Forrest Gump"". Now, these two are one of the few greatest movies in my list.
When I started watching this movie. I thought it will be a motivatinal movie and not much entertaining. But, in few minutes, the outlook changes to a romance genre. And then, in no time, it will be a comedy movie. It changes to action, war, a bit of sports and what not. Then, it was just oscillating between all genres and finally creates it own outstanding genre.
Story writing for such movie and direction needs a distinguished talent. This movie tells us about so many values in life.
Gump's mom beleiving and also making sacrifices to get her son to mainstream even when everyone is writing him off as stupid, making him believe that he is equally capable are so meaningful. It establishes Gump's character. He learns to ignore distractors and abusers and just concentrates on his work. Excels in what he is strong at and also remains grounded at the same time.

Greatest movie ever..,"I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.I can't think of anyone else as Gump, after seeing how Hanks makes him into a person so dignified, so straight-ahead. The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths.Forrest is born to an Alabama boardinghouse owner (Sally Field) who tries to correct his posture by making him wear braces, but who never criticizes his mind. When Forrest is called ""stupid,"" his mother tells him, ""Stupid is as stupid does,"" and Forrest turns out to be incapable of doing anything less than profound. Also, when the braces finally fall from his legs, it turns out he can run like the wind.That's how he gets a college football scholarship, in a life story that eventually becomes a running gag about his good luck. Gump the football hero becomes Gump the Medal of Honor winner in Vietnam, and then Gump the Ping-Pong champion, Gump the shrimp boat captain, Gump the millionaire stockholder (he gets shares in a new ""fruit company"" named Apple Computer), and Gump the man who runs across America and then retraces his steps.It could be argued that with his IQ of 75 Forrest does not quite understand everything that happens to him. Not so. He understands everything he needs to know, and the rest, the movie suggests, is just surplus. He even understands everything that's important about love, although Jenny, the girl he falls in love with in grade school and never falls out of love with, tells him, ""Forrest, you don't know what love is."" She is a stripper by that time.The movie is ingenious in taking Forrest on his tour of recent American history. The director, Robert Zemeckis, is experienced with the magic that special effects can do (his credits include the ""Back To The Future"" movies and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""), and here he uses computerized visual legerdemain to place Gump in historic situations with actual people.Forrest stands next to the schoolhouse door with George Wallace, he teaches Elvis how to swivel his hips, he visits the White House three times, he's on the Dick Cavett show with John Lennon, and in a sequence that will have you rubbing your eyes with its realism, he addresses a Vietnam-era peace rally on the Mall in Washington. Special effects are also used in creating the character of Forrest's Vietnam friend Lt. Dan (Gary Sinise), a Ron Kovic type who quite convincingly loses his legs.Using carefully selected TV clips and dubbed voices, Zemeckis is able to create some hilarious moments, as when LBJ examines the wound in what Forrest describes as ""my butt-ox."" And the biggest laugh in the movie comes after Nixon inquires where Forrest is staying in Washington, and then recommends the Watergate. (That's not the laugh, just the setup.) As Forrest's life becomes a guided tour of straight-arrow America, Jenny (played by Robin Wright) goes on a parallel tour of the counterculture. She goes to California, of course, and drops out, tunes in, and turns on. She's into psychedelics and flower power, antiwar rallies and love- ins, drugs and needles. Eventually it becomes clear that between them Forrest and Jenny have covered all of the landmarks of our recent cultural history, and the accommodation they arrive at in the end is like a dream of reconciliation for our society. What a magical movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

One of the greatest movies of all time...,"I'm not one to cry that easily while watching movies. Tearing up, sure but not full on crying. Two movies that had me bawling my eyes out were La La Land, and Forrest Gump.What a beautiful story. Forrest will always have a special place in my heart. He will always be one of my most favorite characters ever. This film moves you in ways you don't expect. It hits parts of your heart that you didn't even know were there. It shows you the beauty in the simplicity of life... How we don't have to overthink everything... How innocence is hard to come by, and how precious it is. Forrest's kindness is somehow new and surprising to see and experience, since such innocent kindness is rare... but his own perspective of how kindness could be so simple and easy makes you really reflect on yourself.Tom Hanks was THE actor for this role, I don't think anyone else could have performed as he did. All of the other actors especially Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan and Mykelti Williamson as Bubba give outstanding, touching performances.

"One of my favorite films, an experience you'll never forget. Long Live Forrest Gump.","One of the most entertaining, enjoyable, happy, sad, heartwarming experiences in the entire world. Forrest Gump is EASILY one of my favorite films of all time and (in my opinion) one of the best. It's clever in its storytelling, its humor, and its depiction of the time period is just amazing. This movie will never fail to make me feel the highest of emotions. All of life's lessons in one movie. This also has the best soundtrack of all time, and the score is incredible as well. I don't understand how you could not like this film just a little bit. I've seen some recent hate for this film, and I can't see where these people are coming from.Many have stated that this film is ""propaganda"" and that the theme is ""do what you're told and you'll end up fine"". Screw EVERYONE who says this about this film. People like this look with the eyes of someone with no optimism whatsoever, with a poor, grumpy attitude who constantly thinks everyone is out to get them. They see with eyes that the world is a crappy place with no hope. And I can't lie, it is sometimes. So many things to worry about, so many things that go wrong. Climate change, world hunger, racism, all these terrible things in this world. Most people in the world are pessimistic about the future, but wouldn't it be nice to not worry? Wouldn't it be nice to always be optimistic and live your life to the fullest? This is how Forrest Gump lives. This is the perfect encapsulation of ""ignorance is bliss"". And it's beautiful.Forrest Gump is one of my all time favorite characters. He is not smart at all, and at times is one of the luckiest people in existence, but he's kind, hopeful, a great friend, and never gives up. If only all people could be like Forrest. The ""do as you're told"" argument is stupid af, because all Forrest does the whole film is disobey the things people tell him. When they say he can't walk well, he runs. When they called him stupid, he went to college. When Lieutenant Dan tells him to leave him, he disobeys his orders and saves him. Meanwhile Jenny (who apparently doesn't do as she's told) runs from all her problems and spirals down into the awful world of drugs because of her own choices. And the idea that this is ""propaganda"" is nothing short of ludicrous. This film is very critical of America as a country, and people say it's a ""conservative fantasy of the American dream"". Are you kidding me? I'm a DEMOCRAT myself and I find this statement ignorant as can be.This movie is such a joy to see bro. I can't believe rotten tomatoes has this below 75%. There's a reason it's top 15 on IMDb and one of the most beloved films of the 90s. It's too low rated on Letterboxd. Tom Hanks delivers one of the greatest performances of all time, glad he won best actor. Nobody else could've played Forrest Gump this perfectly. There's so much to take away from this film with its themes of friendship, love, persistence, loss, destiny, hope, god, and optimism. To see the world through the eyes of Forrest Gump is a privilege to behold. I rewatched this in school with all my friends in my history class, and the people who'd never experienced this joy before absolutely loved it. Can't wait to show this movie to my children and/or friends/family who haven't seen it. This will stay in my top 10 for a long time.It's also kind of ironic how my favorite best picture winner didn't even deserve it over The Shawshank Redemption. My god 1994 was STACKED.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump: A Tale of Unexpected Triumphs and Life Lessons,"Here's a rewritten version of your review:Review of Forrest GumpIn many ways, Forrest Gump seems to represent America itself. The film portrays the country as an innocent, somewhat naive figure who stumbles into remarkable achievements, becoming famous, wealthy, and even a hero. It also reflects how people, often feeling lost or empty, seek inspiration and hope from any prominent figure. The movie highlights how the media and news outlets create narratives and perceptions about individuals-sometimes ones that even the individuals themselves aren't aware of or never intended to create.On the other hand, Forrest Gump as a character is truly captivating. He is incredibly genuine, with no understanding of the social masks, hierarchies, or pretense that most people navigate. He sees things and people as they are, without judgment or preconceived notions. He focuses on excelling at whatever is in front of him, and as a result, becomes famous and even wealthy.The film left me with a valuable lesson-or perhaps more of an example to follow: simply give your all to whatever excites you in the moment. Don't worry about the outcome or let it weigh on you, and everything will fall into place. I'm inspired to apply this mindset to my own life.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Could've Been,"This movie has several elements for success in the right place, and could have been a true classic.  Ultimately, however, it is undermined by its own thinly-veiled moralizing and its whitewashing of social institutions and history.

warm and powerful,"Forrest Gump almost finished a whole movie, his life went through life and death, but also ran through a lot of places, every time he stayed at a node, life will have a small turn, this turn will prompt him to continue to run, as if life can no longer stop. Every time he starts his long run, he must be wearing a blue and white plaid shirt and a pair of khaki trousers, followed by a cap and running shoes, which had a close-up shot for several seconds in the movie and have become a fashion trendsetter and loved by many friends.
In fact, it is very rare for a mother to have such a consciousness of life, and everything she bears in her life is also relatively heavy. As a single mother, she raised her son alone, and the obstacles her son suffered because of intellectual reasons need to be ruled out by her.-personally, she bears the expenses of her child's growth and takes good care of a child, all of which is on her one person, but she is still optimistic and upward, and at the same time she teaches her son to be optimistic and upward. It is believed that a fool has such a thing, so the mother is actually a good example of a firm belief in a willing heart all the way, and Jenny is a key to the lock of his bondage.
Forrest Gump's biggest characteristic is his persistence and seriousness. In fact, insisting on itself is a very difficult thing to complete, but someone will still do it, just like Forrest Gump. He has been running, his life is to run, from the beginning of being chased, to run on his own, he has no other distractions in his heart, he has no interest in the purpose, he was asked by Jenny who wants to be a person, he did not understand, he said he is not to be himself.
Forrest Gump also took everything he insisted on with a serious attitude, and it could even be said that he had done both persistence and seriousness in his life, because these two things had led him to make many unexpected achievements by mistake, and he did not feel any difference at all, because in his consciousness, he was himself, not others, and his purpose was to be himself, even if he did not understand how to do himself well. But he actually understood, after he ran through so many corners.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Touching- Zemeckis offers another serving of movie magic,"Kids these days don't see the right movies. While teens flock to the latest Transformers or Saw, they neglect the past- even the not-so- far gone 90's. But there's a strange anomaly in that trend... it seems everybody has seen Forrest Gump at one time or another. And after finally grabbing it on Blu Ray, I can say I've joined that rank. Forrest Gump is a fantastic film, and certainly a good one for the masses to see.There's a better chance than not that if you're reading this, you've already seen the film. You probably won't find anything here that you've already heard before. But if you haven't, read on! There are better films than Forrest Gump, but not many, and it is certainly an excellent film to see, arguably mandatory.Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low IQ, born in the 40's. The film follows his life, showing this impossibly innocent man experience some of the most important events of the mid-to-late 20th century. But he doesn't care for any of that: he just wants to be with his girl, Jenny. At its heart, Forrest Gump is a love story set against a historical backdrop.There's a reason the Blu Ray box says ""Tom Hanks is FORREST GUMP"". His performance is mesmerizing, a one-of-a-kind portrayal of a one-of-a-kind role. A southern man with a low IQ, the embodiment of innocence, who describes things in the most innocent way, like ""the loving father who liked to touch her"", ""the men who dressed up like ghosts"" and other such things the audience understands. And the voice he uses is so iconic and often imitated.But Hanks isn't the only great: the film is host to a group of great characters. There's Jenny, Forrest's childhood friend and love interest. Bubba, Forrest's war buddy and fellow misfit, who knows everything about the shrimpin' business. Lieutenant Dan, as the tragic CO who has quite a journey. And lastly Momma Gump, with her motherly advice and willingness to do anything for her son's education.There's a great feeling to the film. Forrest is such a hero: he does no wrong, he is the underdog from birth. It's not cute or charming, but a heartwarming story of beating the odds. Forrest goes from great scene to great scene, with such greats as football, 'Nam, the hurricane, and the Anti-War rally. With the exception of the Vietnam scene, which is very well handled for such a foreign scene in an otherwise talking-filled movie, the screenplay has wonderful dialogue and a quirky rhythm.A note to those who saw Zumeckis' first great film, Back to the Future. Do not expect more of that. 'Future' was a comedy with drama added, Forrest Gump is a drama with humour added. It's a more mature film,and can take some dark turns, like the 'ice cream' scene.I will draw a parallel to Goodfellas (a good thing). Where Goodfellas shows what the powerful did from the 50's to the 80's, Forrest shows what the everyman (and woman) did during that time. Also, like Goodfellas, Forrest Gump has a fantastic period soundtrack with lots of 'Nam and hippie tunes. Not quite as expansive as the mob film, but excellent nonetheless. Forrest Gump is also more specific: such events as the University of Alabama conflict, Watergate (hilarious) and buying stocks in ""that fruit company"" make for some historically accurate humour, one of Gump's greatest strengths.One relationship in particular is fascinating, the main relation between Forrest and Jenny. They start off the same, but go down wildly different paths, one constructive, the other destructive. They are such opposite people, but only Jenny realizes that. It makes the ending much more interesting, and so much more touching to see Forrest question ""if he's smart"". This is one of the most fascinating aspects of the film.This won the Oscar for visual effects, but I didn't see it at first. The effects are very subtle. Like the ping pong ball, the feather, or- WHAT how is he having a conversation with freakin' President JFK? The effects aren't revolutionary, but very effective. I still don't know how they made the conversations with the dead happen.On the back of the Blu Ray is a quote, claiming the film to be a ""tonic of the weary in spirit"". That's the perfect description. Forrest Gump is an uplifting tale of what a single man, even a fictional one, can do with the hand he is dealt. In a decade remembered for its cultural violence (Silence of the Lambs, Seven, Pulp Fiction) Forrest Gump is a beacon of good nature, and good nature is something everyone needs. 9.1/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

This movie will cause you to open your heart and your mind, following Gump on his journey of determination to prove he could be a real man for Jenny.

Overrated melodrama,"Most opinions have already seen the light of day here, so I'll be brief.As a middle-aged Brit who has had a relatively positive life, I positively loathed the premise on which this film was based - if you are good-hearted then you will triumph against adversity no matter what obstacles life throws into your path (with the subtext ""In America""). Sorry, it just ain't true, even in America. I'm afraid to say that I loathed the way that America took this message to its heart even more than I loathed the message.And I have always disliked the way the Academy often favours ""disease of the week"" performances (I always rated Ernie Hudson's performance as a similarly afflicted character in ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle"" - why did that get overlooked?).But let me be fair. There is a short sequence where Gump tries to ask Jenny if his son is normal - maybe 20 seconds in total. Hanks' performance in this sequence is nothing short of phenomenal and, on its own, justifies his Oscar in this film, even if the rest of it is nothing special.",4.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forest Gump: the best movie ever,"The movie Forest Gump Was the best movie that Tom Hanks ever stared in. Tom Hanks has stared in hundreds of movies that were instant hits but Forest Gump was by far his top performance. There are also many aspects that make this movie the top movie of its time. One scene particularly of the movie really describes what kind of man the main character is and, gives a big glimpse of who he is.Tom hanks has stared in many hit movies; like, The Green Mile, Saving Private Ryan, And The Da Vinci Code. This movie is different that other because it really suits the personality of Tom Hanks and, in the making of this movie it is obvious that he had a lot of fun portraying the role of Forest Gump. The character Forest Gump is portrayed as a man who as a child was bullied a lot as a child because of his leg brace and lack of intelligence. He never new the importance of his life. As a child he met Elvis Presley and gave him the inspiration to do his dance moves that were considered atrocious in that day in age. Also had a great talent for running as he discovered as he was running from Bullies who were on bicycles and a truck chasing him through the fields. As he grew up he didn't gain much more brain power but gained the power of care, empathy, and love. This screen play is sure to make you cry but laugh just as much. That is exactly what the directer Winston Groom was trying to achieve with this film.Furthermore, this film is considered by me and thousands of other people across the globe. This movie won 26 awards and nominated for countless others. Critics have made this a easy 8.7 but, I would give it a ten. Sure to make laugh cry and all of the in between. This was the best movie made its century because of the selfless acts that the main character, Forest Gump had done for his country and those around him. His lack of knowledge on curtain subjects he makes up in his empathy for others and the selfless acts for his friends and family.Although, Forest talks funny and some may consider this annoying. This is a long movie that jumps from scene to scene and one has to be deeply involved in the story line to understand it. People may also question the authenticity of all acts that Forest Gump did. People may also get confused with all of the character that are introduced and later plays a important role.Nevertheless, Forest is a small town man who listens to what he is told and always remembered the quote that everyone has hear one time or another, "" Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates you open it up and you never know what your going to get."" That really meant a lot to Forest because he keeps a open mind to all options and everyone has a place in his heart. For example he just joined the military, and met someone named, Bubu. Bubu and Forest soon became good friends and when Bubu got injured in the battle field, Forest ran back into the dense jungle riddled with gun shots and explosions in search of his friend Bubu with out thinking. This really gave a big inside view on the character of Forest Gump.However, the choice is up to you. Do you think this is a movie that you would thoroughly enjoy? Or just another movie that goes down in your list of movies that you wish to see. It just depends on the kind of movie you enjoy and connect to. If you like comedy, romance, war all in one movie, then I would bump it right up to the top of your list of things to watch.Forest Gump",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It's not brain-burning, science-fiction like the blockbuster Christopher Nolan movies, but it's real and it hits the soul. Forrest Gump will tell you one simple truth: Work hard and love life. If you can't understand Forrest Gump and think it's boring, you're not experienced enough, because it expresses the most straightforward human feelings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
When Movies were fun...,"I remember seeing Forest Gump in the movie theater twice. A movie that you'd actually want to see a second time in the theater is rare these days. I really liked this movie and to this day still will watch it when it's on TV. The acting was great, and characters were fun and enjoyable. Tom Hanks is still one of my favorite actors and along with Robert Zemikis directing you can't go wrong with that combo. The special effects are a bit dated but at the time was pioneering getting Hanks in with all those old historical clips. Still a fun watch.

A story that has become a classic,"An amazing story, deep meaning, great acting, catch phrases, warm memories of the film - all this is ""Forrest Gump"". Full of events and drama, the film has collected an excellent collection of various awards: Oscars, Golden Globes and the British Academy Award for Best Visual Effects.The film looks easy, but at the same time makes you plunge into history. The hero of Tom Hanks is interesting and extraordinary, he is kind and naive. This is what captivates the viewer. He wants to help or even prompt, but as you can see, he copes very well himself. I liked the visual solutions. The creators of special effects masterfully inscribed Forrest in historical moments, ""introduced"" influential people. I remember when I first watched it as a child, I was very surprised that some historical figures were being filmed in the film. It's only later that you realize that all this is a matter of masters of effects.Forrest Gump, despite his problems with development, is very purposeful, diligent. He is a strong-willed person. Despite the fact that it was always hard for him - he was bullied in childhood and in adulthood, the young man did not give up, but showed himself to be the true creator of his destiny. Let him be incredibly lucky in many places, but Gump teaches us all to be strong and go to our goal, do good and love people. In our life, it's not easy to follow this.Actor Gary Sinise showed himself well. A little cheeky, loving to tell the whole truth, he is a great friend to the main character, becomes a victim of war, but does not lose faith in life, although he often swears at her.I like the love line in the movie. Forrest falls endlessly in love, has been helping his chosen one for many years, but she constantly leaves him. Gump, on the other hand, believes in the best, does not demand anything in return from her. He is sincere, kind and honest.Forrest shows the viewer the basics of the basics - treat people the way you want them to treat you. And this works quite well in his particular case. He finds real friends, adherents and even admirers. It's not just that the people of America start running back and forth across the country after him. And he seems to find in this a solution to live on. ""Run, Forrest, run!"" These words have sunk into his soul, and into our memory for many decades.The duration of the film is high, but it does not spoil the impression in any way, because the story is interesting to watch, to empathize with the hero. The film is beautiful, kind and sensual. After watching the view of the world changes, you feel some kind of warmth that this hero gave you. Even if you understand that this is still a film with a lot of fantastic things in it, but its main message has been heard.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump,"""Forrest"" (Tom Hanks) isn't the sharpest tool in the box, but he has an heart of gold and an unparalleled sense of human decency. These laudable characteristics are the result of an upbringing by his mother (Sally Field) which has seen him grow from the bullied young boy from Alabama who discovers that he can run a little faster than your average bear, to a sort of national hero. We learn all this from him as he sits at a bus stop chatting to an initially disinterested nurse, and then to a collection of fellow travellers who learn of his drafting to Vietnam. That's where he meets ""Lt. Dan"" (Gary Sinese) and his new best friend ""Bubba"" (Mykelti Williamson) and where his innate sense of what's right saves lives and earns him the plaudits of a grateful nation (and gets his butt-ox on television too!). His army days taught him much, but nothing so useful as a skill at table tennis. Soon on the American ping-pong squad in China, he manages to get an endorsement that allows him to reunite with the hippified, now paraplegic and disillusioned ""Lt. Dan"" and make a mint shrimp fishing, before returning home to face some fairly predicable family trauma. All of this has been happening against a story of a longing for his one true love. ""Jenny"" (Robin Wright). They've been friends since childhood, but she has a wandering spirit and though his love was requited, it wasn't what he needed. Might there be a future for them, ever? Robert Zemeckis uses a chronology of events in the USA, starting in the 1950s, to create a template for the story of a man who lived through racial tension, war, bullying and emerged the stronger; the more honourable and despite his low IQ was quite capable of putting those more intellectual around him to shame. The photography that cleverly superimposes him into television broadcasts works entertainingly as he gazes bemusedly out onto a audience that is increasingly warming to him. I will admit, I struggled a bit with the running segment towards the end, but Hanks epitomises determination and integrity with Eric Roth's adaptation of the Groom novel allowing plenty of philosophical food for thought whilst having a laugh at scenarios both serious and ridiculous.

The movie has a realistic feel even thought it's fictional but this is because of how it goes though real time events, the main reasons why I love this movie so much is because it's like reading a book the story line takes you to another time and other place and the only bad thing is when it ends and you bounce back to reality.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Wanderer,"Winston Groom published his novel ""Forrest Gump"" in 1986. The book portrays a young autistic man, bumbling through modern American history. On his way, he meets various historical figures. Elvis Presley, President Kennedy and Chairman Mao (whose life he saves) whizzed by. Hollywood showed an early interest in the piece, and Groom was offered $500,000 for the movie rights. But when ""Rain Man"" hit theaters, Tinseltown backed off. Nobody believed the public was interested in another story with a halfwit at its center.So, the project spent almost ten years in development hell. When Paramount Pictures finally green-lit the idea, they demanded that director Robert Zemeckis cut the budget by over $10 million. The big studio even began supervising filming to ensure that the new financial plan was followed. When the money then started to run out, Zemeckis and his male lead, Tom Hanks, agreed to cover what was missing. For a share of the movie's eventual profit, that is.By using the newly developed CGI technology, Robert Zemeckis could show Forrest Gump's meetings with many famous long-gone people. First, the director shot Tom Hanks against a blue screen. He then used existing archival footage that he integrated the actor into with the help of image warping and screen morphing. Finally, George Lucas' company ""Industrial Light & Magic"" distressed the new footage digitally, making it resemble the historical source.Robert Zemeckis has often said that he thought the film would only appeal to those over thirty-five. And certainly, only to Americans. But he was wrong. ""Forrest Gump"" instead became a massive, international success. However, all hopes of getting a sequel were dashed after Tom Hanks declared that he absolutely didn't want to participate in one. And a continuation of ""Forrest Gump"" without Tom Hanks in the lead role would (of course) be impossible.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump,"The movie Forrest Gump has become a well known movie all around the world. Tom Hanks, a very popular and well known actor, portrays the role of Forrest. Forrest Gump is a mentally handicapped man whose disability is not specified in the film. People try to degrade Forrest by calling him names. Whenever someone calls him stupid, his mother, who is played by Sally Field, tells him ""stupid is as stupid does"" which is something he continuously repeats during the film. Although he has a disability and is told by multiple people that he can't accomplish things, he ends up doing things that no one ever imagined that he could do. Graduating high school, going to college on a football scholarship, fighting in the Vietnam War, owning a very successful shrimp business, and meeting several different presidents are just a few of the things that Forrest accomplishes over the course of the movie. Jenny Curran, played by Robin Wright, first meets Forrest on the school bus when she allows him to sit with her. Jenny becomes Forrest's best friend and they then become inseparable, going everywhere and doing everything together. After they finish school, Jenny and Forrest eventually start to drift apart. Forrest serves in the Vietnam War and does countless other things with his life. Jenny's life seemingly goes in the opposite direction, she becomes apart of the ""hippie movement"" and gets involved in some things that she should not be involved in. Throughout the film Jenny makes occasional appearances in Forrest's life. Some of the things she says to Forrest when she sees him is enough to make anyone wonder ""what the heck is she thinking?"". Although there are plenty of other films in the world, this one is by far one of my favorites. With the story line and the different cinematic elements of it, including the feather falling and landing right beside him, this movie proves it is well put together and deserved to win the 6 Academy Awards it was nominated for, including Best Picture and Actor in a Leading Role.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Also Known as The World According to Gump,"30 years ago, a strangely unique comedy drama from then renowned filmmaker Robert Zemeckis known as Forrest Gump was released to the general public. Based on the book of the same name by Winston Groom, the film known for starring Tom Hanks in the lead role became a phenomenal success with critics and audiences and even won Best Picture at the 1995 Academy Awards. Often known as one of Hanks highest regarded performances of all time, the film has endured a strong cultural status in the years since its summer 1994 release. But how well does it hold up in today's current era?The film tells the story about the life of an intellectually disabled Alabama man named Forrest Gump (Hanks) and his experiences in the 20th-century United States. With Gump being established as ""different"" than other people in the world, both during his childhood and adulthood, it makes his numerous life experiences all the more fascinating. From being able to run really fast at a young age and becoming a pro college football athlete as a result, to enlisting in the U. S. Army during the Vietnam War, to becoming wealthy through shrimping and computer sales, the film truly is carried by a number of different events throughout Gump's life. That being said, a lot of these incredible events throughout Forrest's life are in lieu of reuniting with his only real friend from childhood Jenny Curran, the latter of whom ends up on a different albeit dangerous path from Forrest's. By keeping the two characters' fluctuating relationships the core heart of the feature, Forrest Gump is as much of a tale of true love triumphing over hardship as it is a life changing experience from a below average man.But with that said, a life as shockingly extraordinary as Gump's isn't complete without a memorable cast of characters, including that of his mother played by the wonderful Sally Field. Anyone who has had to raise a child in a world that is against them for being different will find solitude in Mrs. Gump's bold yet unconditional love and kindness, and that in turn led to her own son showing the same form of devotion to others. Some of those people include Forrest's soldier comrade ""Bubba"" Blue, whose simple dream of shrimp fishing would be passed on in good hands, and their platoon leader Lieutenant Dan Taylor, the latter of whom is arguably the most fascinating character in the whole feature due to his complicated familial history and later life as a disabled man making & breaking him simultaneously. Many of the other characters outside of historical figures are mainly fodder to emphasize how much Forrest and Jenny care for each other throughout their lives, but the small primary supporting cast are still worthwhile to make this story touching and harrowing at the same time.As for other notable qualities, it is shocking how well the feature holds up for its remarkable effects and editing work that replicate the multiple time periods shown throughout it. Although only shown here and there to heighten Forrest's life changing throughout the years, seeing Tom Hanks in 1993 being incorporated into archival footage of presidential figures like JFK and Richard Nixon looks so seamless that you hardly notice any flaws. Thanks in large part to veteran visual effects artist Ken Ralston and ILM, as well as the accompanying editing work by Arthur Schmidt, the film comes off as a successful tribute to the numerous political eras in the United States both in style and substance. Of course Forrest himself isn't particularly political himself, but the numerous decades he spent throughout his life reflect on him inflicting positive change throughout his life in lieu of the tragedies going on in the world. These are often carried through an incredible soundtrack that carries the ongoing years with banger hits that we can bang our heads at both in unison and harmony.It's really hard to explain exactly why Forrest Gump works as well as it does; it just does somehow. Not only is the film carried through Tom Hanks' demandingly wholesome performance, but the culturally enthralling story beats, splendid supporting cast and innovative filmmaking techniques have allowed this film to age like a fine bottle of wine. Now that this film is enduring its 30th anniversary, now couldn't be a better time to look back at it. It's hard to say if this will win over everyone in the long run, but you neer know what you're gonna get out of it unless you try it, kinda like a box of chocolates.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The GOAT,"There are many great movies but to me, if I had to pick the all time best movie, it would be very difficult not to say Forrest Gump. It's basically a flawless movie between the screenplay, acting, mix of drama and comedy, and is the role Tom Hanks was born to play. It's hard to believe that John Travolta was who the producers originally wanted but he had chosen Pulp Fiction. I'm pretty sure that worked out for everyone because Travolta was perfect for Vega as well.What's great about this movie is its a feel good story of a man who wasn't born with the best abilities but went on to live a remarkable life. It's an example of the old adage ""It's not the size of the dog in the fight but the size of the fight in the dog.""When people say that Citizen Cain is the best movie of all time, it's an absolute slap in the face to movies like Forrest Gump.

Great movie!!!,"The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.I feel that much of Gumps' appeal is his downright sense of doing the right thing regardless of the people and situations around him and we see that in this film. That being the case maybe we all wish we could be just a little more like that, trying to maintain innate goodness and not the trade-offs we often make as we go down lifes highways.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way.

The Greatest Movie of All Time.,"I get into an argument with a friend in New Orleans in 2011. He claims that Forrest Gump is the greatest movie of all time. I am bothered by this and ask him to state his case. He replied that they are parodies, restaurants, everyone quotes it (18 years later), 6 Oscars in a year where the academy saw outstanding movies (shawshank, pulp fiction, lion king!), and goes on and on and on. I argue back saying it only won 6 Oscars (compared to others that won more), that the academy just loves Tom Hanks and Robert Zemekis, and how they are better movies than Forrest Gump. We have to put the argument on hold due to the fact that we were walking to a wedding and had arrived. While sitting in the church at the ceremony, the priest's first words in his sermon are, and i kid you not, ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know which one you are gonna get"". At this point in time, I slowly look to my right, and my friend seating a few seats away, slowly returns a look at me with a cheesy smile and nods his head.

one of the master piece I have ever watched,"*Forrest Gump*, directed by Robert Zemeckis and released in 1994, is a film that resonates with audiences through its heartwarming narrative, memorable performances, and unique blend of drama, comedy, and history. Adapted from Winston Groom's 1986 novel of the same name, the film tells the story of a simple yet kind-hearted man named Forrest Gump, whose life is a series of extraordinary events. Despite his limited intellectual abilities, Forrest becomes a part of significant historical moments, displaying the impact of a pure heart and unyielding optimism.At the center of the film is Tom Hanks' iconic performance as Forrest Gump. Hanks embodies the character with an innocence and sincerity that makes Forrest one of cinema's most beloved figures. His portrayal is not merely about playing a man with a low IQ but about capturing the essence of a character whose worldview is untainted by cynicism or doubt. Hanks' performance won him an Academy Award for Best Actor, solidifying his place in Hollywood as one of the greats.The narrative structure of *Forrest Gump* is one of its most intriguing aspects. The film covers several decades of American history, from the 1950s to the early 1980s, through Forrest's perspective. This journey through time is achieved through seamless special effects, which allow Forrest to appear alongside historical figures like John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. These moments are not just clever visual tricks but serve to highlight the randomness and unpredictability of Forrest's life. The film cleverly juxtaposes Forrest's simplicity with the complexity of the times he lives in, often showing how his straightforward nature allows him to navigate through life's challenges better than those around him.Another standout feature of the film is its soundtrack. The music of *Forrest Gump* is a journey in itself, capturing the spirit of each era portrayed in the film. From Elvis Presley's rock 'n' roll to the protest songs of the 1960s, the soundtrack is both a nostalgic trip and a critical commentary on the times. The music helps to ground the film in its historical setting, making the audience feel the passage of time as they follow Forrest's life.Thematically, *Forrest Gump* explores the idea of destiny versus free will. Forrest's mother, played by Sally Field, often tells him, ""Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get."" This line encapsulates the film's exploration of life's unpredictability and the notion that individuals have little control over the events that shape their lives. Forrest seems to stumble into significant historical moments by chance rather than choice, yet his life is a testament to the power of perseverance and kindness. The film suggests that while we may not have control over what life throws our way, how we respond to those events is what truly defines us.The supporting characters in *Forrest Gump* also add depth and complexity to the film. Robin Wright's portrayal of Jenny, Forrest's lifelong love, is particularly noteworthy. Jenny's life is a stark contrast to Forrest's; where he finds success and happiness, she struggles with her past and her choices. Jenny represents the countercultural movement of the 1960s and the lost innocence of that era. Her relationship with Forrest is tragic yet touching, showing the unrequited love and the pain of unfulfilled dreams.Gary Sinise's performance as Lieutenant Dan Taylor, a Vietnam War veteran who struggles with his post-war life, adds another layer to the film's exploration of fate and redemption. Lieutenant Dan's journey from bitterness to acceptance is one of the film's most powerful subplots, emphasizing the idea that life, no matter how difficult, always offers a chance for redemption.In conclusion, *Forrest Gump* is a film that transcends its era, offering a timeless story about the human condition. Its blend of humor, heart, and history makes it a unique cinematic experience that continues to resonate with audiences. The film's message that life is unpredictable, yet beautiful, is delivered with such sincerity and charm that it remains a beloved classic. Through its memorable characters, evocative soundtrack, and profound themes, *Forrest Gump* is not just a film; it is a celebration of life in all its complexity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Amazing movie!,"This movie is one of my all-time favorites! Tom Hanks' acting was absolutely incredible in this movie and he became a legend. This movie has its funny moments involving Tom and it has its romantic and sad movies that made me cry. When sad scenes were happening in this film, I feel like Tom was actually hurt and when there were situations that I would normally come across in life, I would feel like I could actually jump inside of my television and relive it.Honestly, I didn't even find anything wrong with this movie. I definitely had my moments where I actually felt sorry for some of the characters even though I know it was just acting. But that's how good their actings were. I really like the soundtrack in this movie as well, especially the soft piano music in the introduction.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Best Movie of 1994,"One of best made movies of all times (in my eyes). Inspiring and cool as well as funny. The story is told in way that can make ""special"" people be smart and understanding.

Jon Monsarrat review:  an overly sappy soap opera,"I'm an action movie guy. Primarily, I like it when things blow up. So to begin with, ""Forrest Gump"" was not going to be my kind of movie. But I like an intelligent film that has something to say, and I think I ""get it"" about this film. It's a journey through modern American history, showing a window into mainstream culture from the plight of the main character.Unfortunately, the film is incredibly sappy. Everybody who can possibly get hurt gets hurt. If it's a sunny day, it will start raining in this film. Then we get to linger on this melancholy in endless melodramatic scenes. Meanwhile Forrest, who is stupid as a stump (unlike brilliant actor Tom Hanks who plays him) is an anti-hero who lets others push him around. There's no deep theme, and the movie is sub-intellectual.These things built up into what is essentially an amateur script surrounded by a blockbuster hype and star cast. ""Forrest Gump"" is basically a soap opera, and I do mean to conjure images of daytime TV at its worst.Who should see this film:-- Soap opera fans-- Everybody else, run for the hills -- even if you do havean artistic film school depthI'll give ""Forrest Gump"" a 2 out of 10, because it at least maintained a consistent tone throughout. If you don't like the first ten minutes, stop watching.",2.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump,"The kindness and warmth shown in the film touch the most beautiful things in the hearts of the audience and show the beautiful emotions such as honesty, trustworthiness, earnestness, courage and affection. Forrest Gump is portrayed as the embodiment of virtue in the film. He is honest, trustworthy, serious, brave and attaches great importance to emotions. He does not expect anything in return for people's efforts and never mind others' rejection. He concentrated what little wisdom, faith, and courage he had, and he did not care, except to follow his instincts and run along the road.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Destiny or coincidence?  Forrest Gump's relevance will transcend time.,"Do we have a predetermined destiny or is it all just a coincidence? Forrest Gump, played by Tom Hanks, is not quite sure but, he is going to take us on a journey throughout his life and try to figure it out. Mama or Mrs. Gump, (Sally Fields) serves as his moral compass and tries to direct her son through life's lessons. She encourages her son to be himself and he is not different than anyone else, even if he has a low IQ of 75. His school age love, Jenny (Robin Wright), whom he will always love, takes on a role to protect him and his innocence. She even tries to protect him from her life choices.Hank's outstanding and convincing performance takes us through life and American history through the eyes of incorruptibility and taking each interaction at face value without the cynical perspective of the outside world. When faced with life's diversity, Gump equivocally responds with one of Mrs. Gump's famous life lessons such as, ""Stupid is, as stupid does!"" Forrest achieves a lot in his life like, becoming an All- American football player, being awarded the Medal of Honor, and last but not least becoming a millionaire. He even meets three different Presidents. Unintentionally proving that he is capable of more than what the outside world had imagined and became more successful in the process. As with anything in life, his great fortune is also accompanied with loss. He struggles to understand why it has to be a part of life.Alan Silvestri's magical composition carries us through the emotional ups and downs of love, loss, and life while smoothly transitioning us through time. Each piece of the soundtrack corresponds appropriately to the time period, convincing us even more that that is where we are.In ""The Notebook"" we are taken on a similar journey through love and life lessons that spans over a period of history. Throughout the film you are left to wonder if the two main characters have a predetermined destiny to be together, much like Gump and Jenny.Robert Zemeckis brilliantly utilizes the floating feather at the beginning and end of the film as a metaphor for human life. Gump decides at the end ""I don't know if we each have a destiny or if we are just floatin around accidental like on a breezemaybe it's both happening at the same time.""If you have not watched Forrest Gump, I highly recommend it. You will not be disappointed!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

ONE OF THE BEST DRAMA FILMS,"Forrest Gump, one of the best films in the world, starring Tom Hanks, offers the viewer a good movie experience throughout his life. Tom Hanks gives life to Forrest Gump, the movie's owner. It is still one of the best drama movies, even after many years since the film was released. Forrest Gump has a 75 IQ rating, a bit behind normal people, but it's actually a character that does what most people can't. While watching Forrest's story, I am sure that most viewers have a smile on their face. Although the movie is a drama movie, it can make people laugh. He also makes an effort to get the girl he loves. The movie contains both action, comedy and drama. A movie that everyone should watch. While some parts are absurd, everyone should watch. To me the best part was the end. It has a very dramatic end. My score for the movie is 100/82",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Great film,"I believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However, from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the filmmaker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Young dolt is showered with unmerited and unachieved blessings demonstrating that ""ignorance is bliss""—Not","""Forrest Gump"" professes to be all about innocence, but is certainly the most pernicious highly popular movie of my lifetime, whose subtext is the message that there is something virtuous about invincible ignorance, which will be rewarded in all sorts of improbable and arbitrary ways. An exercise from beginning to end in magical thinking, the movie undermines the manifest fact that achievements in life should and must be earned, and that understanding proceeds from knowledge, which must, in turn, be gained through education, the broader the better. ""Forrest Gump"" was the perfect vehicle for the reactionary Reagan era, with its ""what me worry"", feel-good-about-America message, regardless of what we were (and are) doing, and however much suffering we may countenance or cause (whether in Vietnam, Chile, Guatemala, El Salvador, Angola, or Iraq, then or now). The movie was also a major piece of propaganda in the then new revisionism regarding the Vietnam War that began under Reagan, depicting anti-war activists as the perfect fit for that most tenacious of ""urban legends"", the spat upon veteran (the only people who spat upon the veterans were the Johnson and Nixon regimes that put them in harm's way, and then dumped them on the streets without providing any transitional or sustained support before PTSD was fully acknowledged as a consequence of trauma in combat). This movie is also a perfect fit for the kind of know-nothing nativism expressed by the likes of Sarah Palin and the ""Tea Party"" movement, and thus a sad commentary on the present condition of life in America as well. It is not a ""Candide"" for our time.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
sickly Sweet and sad(but i love it),"The first time I watched Forrest gump, I thought to myself ""golly what a bad film"" then i watched it a second time, just yesterday. and thought ""hrmm, this film is better than I remembered""the film centres around the titular Forrest gump, a possible mentally disabled man who touches the hearts of many, and influences many historical events in his life, from Vietnam to football.my main grievance of this film is the way that everything in Forrest's world exists to make you feel sad. everything that happens to him is supposed to make you cry or feel bad for him. whenever something nice happens to him, there's a big ol' SCREW YOU FORREST right behind it. sure, it is supposed to be a sad tale, but it gets to a point where you just want to give the poor guy a break for once. HOWEVER, this is also the best part about the film, Forrest's unawareness of his hardships and how friendly he is really makes you root for him, its a real success story. I felt like some of the ""cameos"" Forrest made in historical events were a bit silly. but that's just me i suppose.I liked it. great film with a few little hiccups.8/10 for sure at least.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

One of the best movies I've seen,"As much as I love superhero and action movies, Forrest Gump is so far, the best movie I've seen. I loved how Tom Hanks played the role as Forrest. It was very moving. Forrest Gump's life can somehow be similar to every people's life. There will always be challenges and it could be hard but you can always go through it and succeed in life. That's what the movie is all about.Another thing is, there will be people that will help or make your life uneasy but all those people actually have a purpose, in reality and in the movie. Forrest Gump tells us that ""Life is like a box of chocolates, you'll never what you'll get."" Which in reality is also true. This movie has a lot of life lessons that you'll appreciate.In conclusion, Forrest Gump is such a great film. It has a great story and lovable characters.

Run Forest!,"Ah, so many references to this movie, either from comedy shows or in real life. Forrest Gump is a great movie, I love it when you get introduced to this one person's life from inside out and are allowed to see all of its futileness. At that one moment you realize how the smallest of things are the most important and how life can be lived like a feather, floating up in the air.Forrest Gump lives through war, joy, suffering, but he stays human, he loves and hates, but more loves, till the end of the film. Making the protagonist disabled makes him even more vulnerable a character that more of us can relate to. Because even though most of us aren't disabled physically, we all suffer from time to time.I love one sequence that really stuck with me here. That is when Forrest runs, everyone comes, asks for a cause and joins him. Forrest does not have a reason to run - life just goes on, and he simply has to do something to live, and to feel alive - Forrest runs, as he used to in the childhood.

Dima,"""Forrest Gump"" is a timeless cinematic masterpiece that transcends genres and captures the essence of the American experience. Released in 1994 and directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film follows the life of Forrest Gump, a simple-minded yet kind-hearted man whose journey takes him through some of the most pivotal moments in American history.At its core, ""Forrest Gump"" is a story about the power of perseverance, love, and the triumph of the human spirit. Through the eyes of Forrest, played brilliantly by Tom Hanks, we witness a life filled with both joy and sorrow, triumphs and challenges. From his childhood struggles with leg braces to his time serving in the Vietnam War, Forrest's unwavering optimism and resilience inspire us to never give up, no matter the obstacles we face.One of the film's most poignant themes is the idea of destiny and how our choices shape our lives. Throughout the movie, we see how Forrest's seemingly random encounters and decisions lead him on a path that intersects with key historical events and influential figures, from meeting Elvis Presley to inspiring John Lennon's iconic song ""Imagine."" These moments not only highlight Forrest's unwitting role in shaping history but also underscore the idea that every action we take has consequences, both big and small.The relationship between Forrest and his childhood friend and love interest, Jenny, played by Robin Wright, is central to the film's emotional core. Their bond, which spans decades and is marked by love, heartbreak, and redemption, is a testament to the enduring power of friendship and the impact of unconditional love. Jenny's struggles with her own demons and inner turmoil mirror the societal upheavals of the time, adding depth and complexity to her character and highlighting the film's exploration of personal growth and redemption.""Forrest Gump"" is also a visual marvel, thanks to Zemeckis' masterful direction and groundbreaking special effects. The seamless integration of Forrest into historical footage and events, such as his meeting with President Kennedy or running across the country multiple times, creates a sense of wonder and magic that enhances the film's storytelling. The use of visual motifs, such as the feather that symbolizes destiny and freedom, adds layers of meaning and symbolism to the narrative, inviting viewers to reflect on the deeper themes at play.The film's soundtrack, featuring iconic songs from the 1950s to the 1980s, serves as a powerful emotional backdrop to Forrest's journey. From the uplifting melodies of ""Sweet Home Alabama"" to the haunting strains of ""Forrest Gump Suite,"" each song enhances the mood and atmosphere of the scenes, evoking nostalgia and emotion in equal measure.In conclusion, ""Forrest Gump"" is a cinematic tour de force that continues to resonate with audiences around the world. Its timeless themes of love, destiny, and perseverance, combined with stellar performances and innovative storytelling techniques, have cemented its status as a classic in the annals of film history. Through Forrest Gump's unforgettable journey, we are reminded of the enduring power of hope, resilience, and the human capacity for greatness in the face of adversity.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump,"1994's Oscar winning Forrest Gump may be one of the best movies to date. Tom Hanks plays a young man by the name of Forrest Gump, a man who isn't too bright but lives a plentiful and, what some may say, 'rollercoaster' life. Unaware of the world Forrest sets off, feet first and faces many obstacles that he overcomes. As we are taken through Forrest Gump's life, the viewer is filled with a rush of emotions: excitement, fear, hope and most importantly love. The story between Forrest and his childhood sweetheart, Jenny is definitely one of the most hearts breaking, and inspiring love stories of any romantic movie ever. The viewer is able to relate to Forrest's tremendously rough life as we have all been through difficult times. Forrest Gump is a life-changing movie that changes the way one views life. The confidence Forrest Gump has and exerts throughout his life is truly admirable. Forrest courageous pursuance of success and happiness is one for the book. Many movies that focus on one than more genres tend to focus on primarily one genre. Forrest Gump is a comedy, a drama, and a romantic film and director Robert Zemeckis does a great job at portraying each genre cohesively. Forrest Gump is a great movie for all ages. If you are looking for a movie that is profound and an all time classic, you are looking at the right place. As one of the top 30 grossing movies of all time you are sure to enjoy the captivating story of one of the most heroic and dynamic fictional characters, Forrest Gump.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Epic, Emotional and stunning!",One of The most Emotional movie i have ever Seen.The whole part where Hanks Acts as Innocent was the best part. It depicts the real modern life .

My Opinion,"I have watched this movie in Spanish class when I was in high school. At first I didn't like it , but towards the end I did. The way he portrayed his character was really good. I didn't expect for him to do that. I love how he got his accent down. It was really a nice movie to watch. It was entertaining but then again boring for me to watch because I didn't really understand it. I would recommend it to anyone else though if they like movies like that. Even if they just want to see him play someone else for a change. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite actors. This is one of his best films, the one I like best I think is the one where he was on the beach. Cast away",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A major disappointment,"After all the hype and promotion, I was disappointed at the lack of content. The scenes of nudity and sexuality were unnecessary and made a film which could have been great an embarrassment for those of us who prefer to stay out of other folks' bedrooms.  The acting by Mr. Hanks, however, was superb. (The only reason I gave it a ""3"" instead of a ""1"")  He made me empathize with, and love, Forrest.  His portrayal of this gentle man was the bright spot in this fatally flawed movie.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Lovable. Adorable. Inspiring. Wonderful!,"This movie... I don't know.In general, I don't like Tom Hanks. It's not that he's a bad actor - he's clearly not. I just don't like him - I don't adequately perceive the facial expressions he makes when he introduces his characters, I don't like the sound of his voice, etc. I also had my doubts about this movie for exactly the reasons listed above. One of my best friends had been pushing me to watch Forrest Gump (1994) for a long time and I finally decided to give it a chance. I'm grateful for that.It's close to a 10/10 and maybe if I watch it again I'd increase my rating.The film doesn't shine on gorgeous cinematography /although it's very good/, nor does it shine in almost any other technical aspect. It's just that the story itself is so inspiring and compelling, and Forrest Gump /the main character/ is so charismatic and likeable, that one can't help but fall in love with him and the journey and interesting adventures he goes through.The love story is murderously cruel and wonderful.The character Forrest Gump himself is a feast for the eyes and our perception of the world.Why 9/10? I don't know. Name something. Maybe the side-plot? Is there one? I'm on the verge of giving it a 10.Final score: 10/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Movie heart-breaker!,"Forrest Gump is a movie heart-breaker of oddball wit and startling grace. There's talk of another Oscar for Tom Hanks, who is unforgettable as the sweet-natured, shabbily treated simpleton of the title. The Academy is a sucker for honoring afflicted heroes. In Hollywood, it's always raining rain men. Credit Hanks for not overplaying his hand. He brings a touching gravity to the role of an idiot savant from the South who finds strength in God, country, his childhood pal, Jenny (Robin Wright), and his good mama (Sally Field). When Forrest falls a few IQ points shy of minimal school requirements, Mama knows who to sleep with to bend the rules. Her son has a gift. As Forrest makes his pilgrim's progress from the '50s to the '80s, he becomes a college football star, a Vietnam war hero, a shrimp tycoon and even a father.Taking a cue from Zelig, director Robert Zemeckis places Forrest in a vivid historical context — he talks with JFK, LBJ and Nixon, among other luminaries. The effects dazzle, though never at the expense of the story. Winston Groom, who wrote the 1986 novel, saw Forrest as a modern Candide, an optimist in the face of strong opposing evidence. But Groom is no Voltaire, and neither is screenwriter Eric Roth (Mr. Jones, Memories of Me), who blunts his satire with choking sentiment. It's Hanks who brings humor and unforced humanity to the literary conceit of Forrest, though the slim actor scarcely resembles the 6-foot-6-inch, 240-pound bruiser of the book.In a college dorm with Jenny, who lets him touch her breast, the virginal Forrest ejaculates instantly, losing her interest and his self-respect. In the Army, Forrest saves his captain (Gary Sinise), whose legs are later amputated, and the captain resents him. Forrest is everything we admire in the American character — honest, brave, loyal — and the film's fierce irony is that nobody can stay around him for long.Zemeckis doesn't fall into the trap of using Forrest as an ad for arrested development. He knows the limits of a holy fool who can't understand the hypocrisy of postwar America that this picaresque epic so powerfully reveals. The peace-love pretensions of the '60s are skewered as neatly as the greed decades that follow. But there is something of Forrest that Zemeckis would like to see rub off on us: his capacity for hope. It's an ambitious goal in this age of rampant cynicism. Godspeed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

A Classic,Forrest Gump will forever be a classic film for the ages. There is something about a film where you watch a character start from childhood and watch as they engage in wonderful adventures as they age. Great acting in this film. The casting is spot on.

Great cinematography in here as well. Just a great overall film.,10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Tom Hanks,"I've never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I've never seen a movie quite like ""Forrest Gump."" Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It's a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream.The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction, not the formulas of modern movies. Its hero, played by Tom Hanks, is a thoroughly decent man with an IQ of 75, who manages between the 1950s and the 1980s to become involved in every major event in American history. And he survives them all with only honesty and niceness as his shields.And yet this is not a heartwarming story about a mentally retarded man. That cubbyhole is much too small and limiting for Forrest Gump. The movie is more of a meditation on our times, as seen through the eyes of a man who lacks cynicism and takes things for exactly what they are. Watch him carefully and you will understand why some people are criticized for being ""too clever by half."" Forrest is clever by just exactly enough.Tom Hanks may be the only actor who could have played the role.<3 TOM HANKS <3",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Best Movie I Have Seen,"Forrest Gump is the best movie ever made. When I first saw it I only sat through the first minute of it and turned it off. After growing with my age and watching a lot of other movies, Forrest Gump was the one that I couldn't take my eyes off of. Forrest Gump is the first movie since Titanic that has made me cry because of Tom Hanks and Gary Sinises outstanding performances. Almost never in my life have I been captivated by a movie and how it played out. Forrest Gump is neither too long or too short, for me it never dragged along and made me bored. Out of the six Oscars that Forrest Gump won, this movie rightfully deserved all of it. Pretty much everything made sense to me which made this movie really great for me. All in all I give Forrest Gump a 10 and think that this is a movie that should be watched for the rest of time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"One of the best movies ever made,and will stay a favorite of mine....","I saw this movie, years ago, when it was first released, and amcommenting on it now, years later, as it is and always will be oneof my favorite films.  Everyone has a little, or a lot of Forrest inthem. Though not all share his IQ, or his talents, I think all peopleshare some of his heart. Forrest is the ultimate everyman.  Hispositive outlook on life, no matter the instance, and enjoyment ofthe small things,  is something that inspires. Also Lt. Dan isrelatable for the rest of us, who have a more pessimistic outlookon things, but even in the end, he sees how to be grateful for hislife, and live it, which is what most people want, I think.  The lovestory between Forrest and Jenny, is also one of the most beautifulin film history I feel, entirely pure to the core, yet not a perfectjourney, or ending.

Run!,"The life and times of changing America through the eyes of simple man. A lovely and warming film with Tom Hanks as the lead character telling the story of his life and how things have changed around him. Gump leads an extremely full life but despite everything he does; going to war, going for a long run, inventing crazes, playing sports, meeting presidents, catching shrimp - despite everything, all he wants to do is be reunited with his childhood sweetheart Jenny. It's fair to say that when life throws a problem, he just gets on with it and does his best, showing the audience that it's not worth being down about big things, not when life is so wonderful and varied. Hanks shines and is somehow hypnotic as Gump, grabbing the audience and taking them for a ride. Robin Wright (it's only ""The Princess Bride"" folks!!) is brilliant as Jenny, making you love her and hate her in equal amounts. I also must mention how good Gary Sinise was as Lieutenant Dan - like Jenny I hated him and loved him in equal amounts. His character development is brilliant and goes to highlight that anyone can change. Furthermore, one of the messages of the film (amongst all the others), a small interaction with somebody could have a lasting effect on them - that's how Dan turns out after having known Forrest Gump.This is a pure and inspiration emotional rollercoaster of dramatic film. There are some tongue in cheek moments where factual history is manipulated a little bit, but it's easy to look past these and see a true classic of cinema. If you have not seen this, it is worth rectifying that and watching a true gem as soon as possible - perhaps bring some tissues though.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
...a masterpiece...,"...Robert Zemeckis' Forrest Gump is a cinematic achievement.  Tom Hanks plays Forrest, a mentally handicapped man living through the turbulent times of American history.  Hanks gives an awe-inspiring performance; you can literally see the naive innocence within Hanks' eyes while he plays a man who only wants to do what's right and be the one that he loves. Technically, the movie is a marvel to behold.  You see Forrest in these situations with famous American icons, and for a moment you almost believe that it really happened.  It'll have you laughing and crying almost at the same time.  For anyone that loves movies, Forrest Gump is definitely something to buy and keep for your own...",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Epic movie,"Epic in scope and triumphant in spirit, Forrest Gump is a larger- than-life piece of film-making, that scored home an impressive 6 Oscars in 1995, including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor in a Leading Role. It revolves around the eventful and remarkable life of a mentally, and for some time physically challenged man, who looks at the world through very unique and innocent eyes, as he becomes part of some of the key events that shaped America as a nation. Famous historical figures like Elvis, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon and John Lennon, are just some of the people that he encounters on his grand and amazing journey. Director Robert Zemeckis is a magician behind the camera, delivering world-class visual story-telling that truly captures the heart and mind in really spell-binding ways. So much love and passion have gone into its making, and it's one of those rare cinematic miracles, where all parties involved have dedicated themselves fully to create the best experience possible. Ascended by a beautifully orchestrated music score (together with some great classics from the eras it portrays), it hits all the right notes at all the right moments. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll maybe even feel inspired. For there's nothing in this tour-de-force of a film that isn't absolutely stirring. It's been almost 20 years since its release now, yet the special effects still hold and look as fantastic as ever. They way they've integrated Forrest into real historical footage, is incredibly well- done and nearly seamless in its crafting. Some things even look more convincing than the wizardry of modern features. However visually compelling it may be though, it's in the acting where it truly dazzles. Tom Hanks' sensational, award-winning performance, is definitely one of the best, if not the greatest of feat his entire career. I would say it stands between this and his heart-gripping turn as an AIDS victim in Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia. You certainly can't complain about the supporting cast either. Sally Field, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise and Mykelti Williamson, evoke tremendous pathos and sympathy, with their exceptionally written and terrifically acted characters. Michael Conner Humphreys is really wonderful as well, as Forrest in his younger years. Cynics may have issues with how far-fetched the story is, but I don't think it matters much in the larger perspective. I'm more than willing to suspend all disbelief, for such a majestically conceived and viscerally powerful piece of drama. And I'm sure that goes for a lot of us. A movie about love, loss, war and human behavior. About discovering your inner potential and overcoming your limitations, even when everything seems against you and absent of hope. For within Forrest Gump dwells a ray of pure inspiration, with the message that life is what you make of it. We may not all come to shake hands with the President or amount to champions in ping-pong, but we all possess the power to make the best of what we have. Timeless, magical, moving and uplifting, this movie is a celebration of all that and more!",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Like it,"Forrest Gump is a timeless classic that weaves together humor, heart, and history in a way that few films can match. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the movie follows the life of Forrest Gump, a man with a kind heart and limited intelligence, played masterfully by Tom Hanks. Despite his challenges, Forrest finds himself at the center of key historical events in the 20th century, all while pursuing his love for Jenny, portrayed by Robin Wright.The film's charm lies in its ability to blend poignant moments with light-hearted humor, making it both uplifting and deeply moving. Hanks delivers a career-defining performance, bringing sincerity and warmth to Forrest's character. The movie also features an iconic soundtrack that perfectly complements the era-spanning narrative.Forrest Gump is not just a film; it's a journey through life's ups and downs, reminding us that, as Forrest says, ""Life is like a box of chocolates-you never know what you're gonna get.""

Magnificent,"To say it with a cliché: they don't make 'em like this anymore. ""Forrest Gump"" is pretty much everything that was great about 90s cinema and more.

The way the plot develops is truly beautiful, because Forrest Gump is one of the greatest underdogs I've ever seen in a movie. You can't help but feel happy whenever he accidentally writes world history, or just when he misunderstands things yet again and shows his butt to the president.

The cast are fabulous with Tom Hanks playing Forrest and Gary Sinise, Robin Wright, Sally Field and Mykelti Williamson ably supporting. The production values are amazing with each era being instantly recognisable from the costumes, music and sets. The direction by Robert Zemeckis is wonderful as all the production could have smothered the story but instead we are allowed to go on a magical journey through with life with Forrest.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Forrest Gump,A simple man in search of what most of us want in life. Validation as a person just as he is and not as others would have him. Understanding and peace within himself and life. To Love one woman and have her love him in return.Simply a great movie to watch not matter what year it may be. It's turned into a timeless classic.

"Obnoxiously politically correct, but...","In all fairness and all clichés and preachy political statements aside, Forest Gump is an extremely watchable film on a basic level.If you just see it as a straightforward biographical story, then director Robert Zemeckis really gets you involved in the main character throughout his life. It features comedy, a war story, portrayals of eras, issues of acceptance and tops it off with a romance story--all supported by mostly strong performances and a fantastic soundtrack.However, when you scratch the surface of some of these things--and sometimes you don't even have to--you see the many issues that the film attempts to tackle and they are so many and so stupidly treated that it really ends up a babble of political correctness. AIDS, prostitution, racism, war, drugs and conformity are all touched upon at various stages of Forest's life as he experiences them like the innocent child that he is.The treatment of some of these issues is offensively moralistic and perpetuates and facilitates the holier-than-thou moral high-ground that Zemeckis takes in the film.Example: Forest fights in Vietnam war. Forest denounces war. Forest makes best friends with an African American guy. Forest won't take drugs. Forest helps bitter handicapped guy. Forest has a sincere mind. The only remotely rebellious character in this film is killed off with AIDS.Or maybe I'm simply too cynical to truly enjoy Forest Gump and its preachy optimism and 'fine-and-dandy' attitude. Either way, this film is obnoxiously politically correct but still quite enjoyable.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Avoid this movie,"I almost walked out of the theater when I saw this movie. I usually love Tom Hanks, but his acting was wooden and his character was unbelievable. I was very disappointed when it received an academy award. The movie was supposed to be inspiring, but it's hard for me to be inspired when there's so little that's recognizable about a character. I think the reason the box of chocolates line was quoted so much was that that was all that was memorable about the movie. One ""effect"" that I especially disliked was the technique whereby Forrest Gump was included in old footage. In addition, I found myself worrying about Sally Field's career. There was a period in her career when she was in some excellent movies and this role as a pitiful mother definitely seemed like a step down.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The nature of the main character Forrest Gump can certainly be a good example for everyone.,"So what kind of traits can we imitate from Forrest Gump's character?1. Loving Parents
We can see how much Forrest Gump loves his mother. In the film he is willing to swim from the ocean and run through the city when he hears the news that his mother, Mrs. Gump is sick. Forrest Gump certainly realized that his mother's struggle could not be reciprocated with anything. The mother who always supports Forrest in the midst of his shortcomings makes Forrest realize that his mother is his hero
2. Always positive and optimistic
Although Forrest Gump is known as an idiot character in the film. But his stupidity is not a problem for a Forrest. He keeps going and always thinks positive. Don't complain and always try. In the film, Forrest Gump always shows his positive nature in any situation and in any crisis. Can you copy this
3. Never give up and be generous
Of course, if you have watched the Forrest Gump movie, you will realize how generous the character Forrest Gump is. After he managed to create a shrimp company with the initials of his friend Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation. He and Lieutenant Dan, a character frustrated by his disability during the Vietnam war, started a shrimp fishing business. After repeatedly failing to catch shrimp at the beginning of his search for shrimp. Forrest Gump didn't give up. He tried many times and of course failed many times. Until one day his shrimp catch was successful and together with Lieutenant Dan he managed to create the most successful shrimp fishing company in his city. Forrest Gump, who seemed to be a very successful businessman, didn't feel happy. Until finally he handed over his company to Lieutenant Dan and gave his income to the Bubba family, his best friend who had motivated him to start the shrimp fishing company.4. Good promise holder
Bubba is a black man whom Forrest met when he joined the military. Forrest and Bubba's relationship is quite unique. It's said that their friends don't seem too close. But this is the other side of the Forrest Gump movie. Bubba, who when he was with Forrest, always talked about the world of shrimp, of course, for many people who listened to him talk about shrimp, it was quite boring but not with Forrest, he always listened to Bubba talk about shrimp and Bubba's dream that when he finished his military duty he would set up a shrimp company with Forrest. But unlucky, Bubba died on the battlefield. Until it was left Forrest with his promise with Bubba to set up a shrimp fishing company. Instead of burying the promise. Forrest kept his promise to his best friend Bubba by successfully founding a very successful company, the Bubba Gump Shrimp Corporation. Forrest's promise and dream with Bubba finally came true.5. Don't forget friends and best friends in any situation
The next Forrest Gump trait that you can emulate is that he always helps anyone. U can see it in the film even in critical times when Forrest and his troops are attacked by the enemy. Had separated well with his best friend Bubba and Lieutenant Dan. Forrest did not want to stay silent, he finally returned to the battlefield and saved his friends who were still alive even though they were full of wounds. No exception for Lieutenant Dan who he saved even though he had to lose his leg in the end. Lieutenant Dan, who was frustrated with his disability, was angry with him.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Excellent!!,"This is a great family movie and will never get old, is an all-time classic. one of Tom Hanks best performances.The movie is set back in the early years, and seen through the eyes of Forrest (Tom Hanks) as a young boy with physical disabilities who grows up to become an inspiration to all people he encounters throughout his life.This movie kept me and my kids entertained the whole time.

Bittersweet yet Entertaining,"Forrest Gump really delves deep into the emotions of human beings and explains how emotional attachment leads to relationships, that, if toxic, can completely devastate a person. It also shows us how society's ruthless and mocking attitude really does leave scars on a person and why everyone deserves to be respected. On the other hand, Tom Hanks's mesmerizing performance as Forrest also makes one realize that people why honesty, sincerity, dedication and respect can go a long way towards making the world a better place. A 10/10 for a classic that is definitely both heartwarming and entertaining.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Good but not great,"I found this to be an entertaining film, certainly. However, I just don't see it as one of the top 250 films of all time. Tom Hanks does a great job playing Forrest Gump throughout the film. Sally Field as his mother is also quite good, so the problem isn't with the acting. The story is a shade weak, I think. It skips around a good bit and ends up slightly disjointed. Overall, the story is OK, but not 6 Academy Awards worth. It's trying to preach a sermon about ordinary (or less) people being able to make it, yet the message gets lost in the rambling story. I just don't think it was quite in the league that it currently finds itself in. All in all, a very good film, but not a great one. Looks like I'm in the minority, though!",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
The lines touching me most in the book is 'My momma always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you are goanna get.',"Yes, life is full of uncertainty & puzzle. For someone, they wish to have the power to forecast future. Because they can be well prepare for the opportunities and challenges and even know the lucky numbers of lottery beforehand. But for me, I don't want to have such 'ability' at all. Life is a mystery and everyone has his own way. I enjoy the surprise of receiving gift from my classmates on my birthday and running into an old friend on the street in another city, etc. There are so many amazing incidents in my life which can't be happen if I have the power to forecast the future.
To Forrest Gump, who was born with intellectual disturbance and muscle problem in his leg, he never imagined that he could become a famous American football player, a war hero and even a millionaire. Forrest won dignity and respect though his strive and perseverance.

His dedication to his roles, specifically this one stands out on a level which is highly noticeable.

This is a movie which will make you feel good about humanity and maybe make you into a better person.Tom Hanks delivers an exceptional performance as Forrest Gump. There is excellent character development shown. I think the best part of his character is that despite the various obstacles he faces, his good heart and mindset always lets him continuously improve his life. His sincerity and simplicity is touching and allows the viewer to connect on every level with Forrest Gump.I also appreciate this film for being able to weave the life of an individual with the historical and social background of the relevant time periods. There are some explicit historical scenes, such as the Vietnam War scenes, and they are filmed well. The social class subtleties embedded in such scenes are interesting as well. I am sure if I watch this film another time, I will notice even more noteworthy details pertaining to social issues.

"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna get","With this wisdom the movie takes off and Forrest Gump introduces himself. He tells his life story to anyone who wants to hear it. And what a story it is. Although simple-minded, following the advice of his mother and childhood friend Jenny, Forrest gets places. His mother tells him he's the same as everyone else, and no different at all. And she makes sure he goes to a regular school, no matter what it takes. And on the school bus he meets his one and only girlfriend, Jenny. Together they're like peas and carrots. She tells him that whenever he's in trouble, he should run away. And she cheers him shouting 'Run, Forrest, run!'. He can run like the wind blows. It literally takes him anywhere. During his travels, he also meets up with various interesting people and gets involved in American history in the making.Tom Hanks puts up a great performance and definitely pulls it off with flying colors.

Movies are like a box of chocolate: you never know what you're gonna get,"Forrest Gump,"" despite its immense popularity, is a film that falls short of its acclaim. While the movie's intention may have been to deliver a heartwarming story about an ordinary man's extraordinary journey, it ultimately suffers from a lack of depth and a reliance on sentimentalism. The character of Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks, is portrayed as a simple-minded individual who happens to stumble into numerous historic events, which is an implausible and contrived concept. Moreover, the film's portrayal of historical figures and events feels forced and superficial, reducing them to mere props in Forrest's story rather than exploring their significance in a meaningful way. Furthermore, the movie's attempts to tackle complex social and political issues, such as racism and war, feel shallow and oversimplified, reducing them to mere plot devices rather than engaging in a nuanced exploration. Overall, ""Forrest Gump"" may have its moments of charm, but it ultimately fails to deliver a thought-provoking and substantive cinematic experience.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"A brilliant, but misunderstood movie","I adore this movie. The casting was exceptional, especially Sally Field and Robin Wright Penn. The soundtrack fit perfectly. The only thing is, I don't believe many people actually understand what Forrest Gump is about. Many see it as a sentimental story among the backdrop of the late twentieth century, complete with events like the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the Disco Era, the AIDS scare, ect. Actually, this film is a spoof on reality. I came up with this theory the first time I watched it, and have since heard similar comments from the director, Robert Zemekis. It is absurd how a man from a small town in the deep south with an IQ of 75 can become so entangled in American history - becoming a war hero, meeting several presidents, playing ping-pong in China. It's really a comment on American life. In a way, Forrest Gump represents a skewed version of Everyman.

Stupid is this movie,"On the plus side, I think I saw this movie for free, or at the most paid $1 for admittance when I was in college and it was shown in the campus theater. On the negative side is everything else, most notably the movie's lack of empathy for any of its character.  Every character, not just Gump, is walking through this movie with no goal, no destination, and no clue, as to what the other characters are doing.  Someone off-screen must've just shouted ""move"" over and over again, and then filmed the result.  Gump goes here.  Gump goes there.  Sally Field says this.  Sally Field dies.  And so on.  The reasons behind the historical footage inserts is not to prove it can be done but to distract one from realizing how badly the rest of the film had come together up until the inserts.Anyone who cheers for this movie must also resemble a box of chocolates - flat, consisting of cardboard, and soon empty of their contents.",1.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The story depicts several decades in the life of Forrest Gump, a naive and slow-witted yet athletically prodigious native of Alabama who witnesses, and in some cases influences, some of the defining events of the latter half of the 20th century in the United States; more specifically, the period between Forrest's birth in 1944 and 1982.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A great film,"Forrest Gump is one of my favourite movies and has to be one of the most feelgood movies of our time. However I feel that people are unnecessarily harsh on the film due to the success it recieved at the academy awards. It beat Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption to the Best Picture Oscar and has been criticised since. All three films are superb movies in their own right, ( Shawshank just shading it as my favourite), and should be enjoyed on their own merits rather than on what they prevented others doing.I may be wrong but I feel a lot of the criticism of the film is due to the academy awards and that if Forrest Gump had won on a different year it would not suffer the criticism it does.Anyway on with the film. Hanks was brilliant as usual and the support players especially Sinise, and Williamson will live long in the memory. OK towards the end there are too manny references on how Forrest misses Jenny ( e.g naming the boat )but overall I think Robert Zemeckis balances out the emotional with the humorous and it is close to a perfect film.1994 was truly a great film and the arguments about who should have won will go on and on, just be grateful that 3 splendid films came out together.

An amazing life.  An amazing movie.,"Few, if any, characters in movie history have had an amazing a life as Forrest Gump. He's such a simple man. Stupid? Stupid is as stupid does. Forrest may be a little slow. But he gets life, he knows what's important. He remains true to himself, to his values. He is fiercely loyal to those he loves. And as Forrest himself says, though he is not a smart man he knows what love is. Just by doing what he knows in his heart to be right this simple man has the most incredible life. His journey is magical, inspiring, heartwarming. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's poignant, it's mesmerizing. Forrest Gump touches the lives of so many people around him. And along the way he changes the course of world events too. This is a life which has to be seen to be believed.So how does an Alabama boy with an IQ of 75 end up changing the world? Just by being himself. Life happens all around him and Forrest is often blissfully ignorant. He finds himself caught up in one extraordinary situation after another. In each situation, without fail, he just does the right thing, the good thing. He does what ""smarter"" people, given the opportunity to think about the situation, might not. He thinks not of the consequences, he just follows his heart. And that heart takes him to the most amazing places. He is a man driven by love. Love for his friends, for his mama, and above all for his beloved Jenny.The story of Forrest and Jenny is inspiring and tragic, heartwarming and heartbreaking all at the same time. From their first meeting as children the bond between these two is unbreakable. No matter how they may drift apart that connection is always there. And drift apart they do for while Forrest has his amazing life's journey Jenny has a journey all her own. She embraces life in her own way. In confronting her demons she makes some bad choices. No matter how far gone she may seem to be she knows, and we know, that Forrest will always be there for her. Forrest doesn't judge her as so many others would. He just loves her, always and forever, no matter how hard she makes it to love her at times. It really is one of the great relationships in movie history.The relationship between Forrest and Jenny is the real heart of the story but there's so much more. With everything Forrest experienced it's remarkable that director Robert Zemeckis managed to cram it all into less than two and a half hours of film. And give credit to Zemeckis too for creating the right tone for the film. In the wrong hands this could have been an overly sentimental mess of a film. But in Forrest Gump Zemeckis presents a film, and a character, which is good but not too good to be true. So many outrageous things happen to Forrest Gump but you believe in this story every step of the way. Zemeckis put all the pieces together perfectly. Everything fits, right down to the wonderful soundtrack with the perfect songs for each of the big moments in Forrest's decades-long journey. A great share of the credit for the film's success of course goes to Tom Hanks who played Forrest to perfection. An obviously challenging character to play. How far do you go in portraying Forrest's innate simplicity? Hanks got it just right. The rest of the cast is terrific as well. Robin Wright hits all the right emotional notes in playing the deeply troubled Jenny. Sally Field is everything you would want your mama to be. Mykelti Williamson brings great personality to the role of Forrest's wartime buddy Bubba. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna Hall are wonderfully endearing as the young Forrest and Jenny. And Gary Sinise is utterly brilliant in playing Lieutenant Dan, a character whose story arc is as dramatic and compelling as can be. Hanks of course won an Oscar for his performance, which was pretty much a given as soon as the film was released. That Sinise didn't pick up an Oscar as well for his supporting role seems borderline criminal. What a performance he gave in a supremely challenging role.Much was made upon the film's initial release about the effects used to insert Forrest Gump into history. The effects may seem quaint by now but they were truly revolutionary at the time. And they add a nice touch to the movie. It's cute seeing Forrest tell JFK he has to go pee or to see him chatting with John Lennon. All of Forrest's brushes with history give the movie a grander scale. They show the impact this very simple man had on the world. But for all the famous people he met, for all the wondrous things he did, Forrest would be the first to tell you that everything he ever needed was right there at home in Greenbow, Alabama. His friends, his mama, his Jenny. That's all Forrest Gump ever needed. And look at the impact he had on those closest to him, often without even trying. Look at where Lieutenant Dan is in life by the end of the film. Forrest got him there just by being himself, by doing what was right. And Forrest was of course always there for Jenny too. Such a simple man yet he touched so many lives. Not a smart man? Listen to what Forrest has to say about destiny in the incredibly poignant scene near the film's end. Maybe Forrest Gump had us all fooled. He may have been the smartest one of all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump is one of my top favorite movies,Forrest Gump is a childhood favorite for me watching growing up. I a fan of Tom Hanks. He did a great job.

Simply my favorite move.,"I have said in other reviews here that other movies are my favorite, but only a select few all share my top number one spot. Forrest Gump is one of them. I felt I had to write something about it, after just seeing the end again on TV; I was just flipping and came across the ending of the most compelling movie ever.Need I say anyway of Tom Hanks' brilliance in this role, I just love the character of Forrest Gump. And the story-- oh, the story, it's so heartbreaking at times, it's so hysterical at times, it's so everything but bad at one point or another-- it's perfect. The story is told so well, the characters are so good, the lines are unforgettable. Needles to say the way they blended the amazing story in with real history is above brilliant... there isn't a thing wrong with this movie. It's my favorite of all time.Concluding, Forrest Gump is cinematic perfection, to all the highest degress. Everyone and thing in it is brillaint, ten out of ten, no, infinite stars is what this movie deserves. Forrest Gump is my favorite all time movie, and that's all I got to say about that.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Schmaltzy and overly folksy, but works","Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) is a simple, slow-witted boy from the country. We see his life story, his simple home-spun sayings that get him through life and how he manages to nonchalantly participate in some of the most momentous events of the 1960s.Simple, but fun. Overly folksy and schmaltzy, but works. Not too profound but if you don't think too much, it's quite enjoyable. The weaving into the plot, and the footage, of actual historic events is wonderful to behold and adds a great comedic element to the movie too.Won the 1995 Best Picture Oscar, though certainly wasn't the best film of that year. The other nominees were fantastic: Pulp Fiction, Four Weddings and Funeral, The Shawshank Redemption and Quiz Show, yet the weakest of the five won the award. I guess the Academy wanted something sappy and simple, not something gritty or clever, to win.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Watchable, with the right expectations","What I mean by this is, if a group of friends really wanted to rent it, I wouldn't spend a 'veto' against the film with the group, but I wouldn't pick it either. It's tolerable if you don't expect too much from this 'box of chocolates'.I saw this when it came out, and I haven't seen it since.What struck me, was that when it was over, that people exiting the film were completely silent. I don't know why the other people in the theater were silent, but I was because the film really didn't deliver. I felt it took me on a long trip to nowhere. Those in my group felt the same way. But clearly, many other people feel otherwise.While somewhat watchable and pleasant enough to see unfold, and mildly funny at times, expectations of 'something profound' are instead met with a really shallow parade of clichés and stereotypes in a narcissistic baby-boomer nostalgia orgy, the kind of thing that was already wearing out it's welcome from 'the big chill' film & 'thirty-something' type TV shows.The viewer seems obligated to sit there and click on pop icons of the baby boomer past, to make them get off the screen and move on to the next. It's a very shallow parade through history.I'm not politically correct by any means, but it does seem like the worst stereotype was pushed of the Vietnam vet, along with other characters, I'm sure many people found some of these characters degrading. A 'slow person' was kind of made fun of, without any real purpose. Some parts of the movie, such as 'the run' was just spontaneous, stupid and pointless.If I had no real expectations, I might not have found it as offensive. But the presentation as though this was something culturally profound when it's not left me flat.",5.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Ahh, once in a while a great film like this comes along.","FORREST GUMP  was the best movie of 1994. Tom Hanks is completely endearing as Forrest, a simple guy shortchanged in the IQ department, who proves that brains aren't the only things needed to succeed in this world. The movie, beautifully directed by Robert Zemeckis, has a nostalgic sweep that will carry you away. The opening shot of a feather on its way to earth is enough to make you gasp aloud, and the movie is just barely underway. Forrest Gump is also a wonder of special effects, but the less said about them, the better. The trailer and promotional pieces gave away much too much of the story. Admittedly, this movie has more than its share of plot, as it covers the decades of the '50s through the '90s. It also makes numerous pit stops along the way to encompass the momentous events that molded the times.The Gump saga begins back in the 1950s under the cloud known as polio. Throughout the years that follow, Forrest must contend with his score of 75 on an IQ test, but the braces on his legs don't hold him back for long. Forrest, who sometimes brings to mind the innocent simpleton hero Charlie Babbit, manages to make quite a few surprising contributions to society without even trying. Sure, some of the movie is sappy, but it is served up with consummate skill and a loving heart. The supporting cast is cannily chosen. Sally (""You like me, you really like me"") Fields, who plays Forrest's mother, may hereafter be known as Sally (""Life is like a box of chocolates"") Fields. You never know what you're gonna get.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A good movie to show you don't need any extra ordinary skills to become a successful person.,"Run Forrest Run!!! If u didn't watch this movie, I seriously suggest you to watch this movie ASAP. It shows a person with no special abilities can also be a world class person (receiving awards from American Presidents).""A stupid is as stupid does"" one line that forrest recites every time remembering his mother. This has a lot of meaning in it. She insists her son not to agree with anyone who says "" I am better than you"". As a little boy forrest with a low IQ and problem in the spine faces a lot of problems with the society. But, his mother has a strong desire to get the best for his Son.In his childhood, he got to meet a little girl of his age who is the only friend of him in his entire childhood. They grew up together but takes two paths which are quite opposite. Forrest goes into the army and then into the VERY successful shrimp business and had become one of the richest persons.

Can't Get Enough of Jenny,"This is a title that never gets boring and always makes you want to come home by the bayou to settle down. It shows you the ups and downs of friendship, how to nurture a childhood romance through space and time, and the simplistic advantage of just doing something without overthinking it. This movie is great for those who may be experiencing a transition in life and working to regain their footing. The family values presented in this movie help you realize how important it is to have a open door communication policy to communicating with different types of people without judgment. I definitely recommend this classic movie for to re-watch time and time again throughout the seasons of one's life. Enjoy the lesson and live courageously.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Technological miracle,"What Forrest Gump tells about is a man, named Forrest Gump , who has intelligence as low as going through American past of 40 years. Forrest Gump is the most amazing film I have ever seen. The way the director directs is a miracle. The first scene, i.e., at the beginning of the film, one feather falling down to where Gump is sitting .It looks like a long and continuous moving scene. Even though you gaze at the feather (I ever did it), you could not tell whether it is true .The shade and reflection make it real. I am really confused the way to make the feather authentic. Beside of the technological miracle, the way the story tells is kind of self-reflection: Gump picks up the feather and puts it into a book. During the whole film, the feather has not been taken out any more until the end .So I am convinced easily that it is a comedy as leisurely as a feather. Definitely, the feather is one of highlights. Begin with the falling of the feather, Gump picks up the feather and begins to tell his experience to strangers. Afterward, he stands up and runs to find Jannie and his son. With the possession of the feather, something different from the former relation between Gump and Jannie: they ultimately marry each other and have the short happy time. Jannie dies of a serious disease. However, she leaves prosperity to Gump and his son, i.e., the prosperity for the next generation. The small family is kept after all (it seems to be prosperous). With the present of the feather, at the time when the old Gump sends his son to get on the school bus, the circle is made full and it is the end of the story. What¡¯s more, what I am thrilled is another revolution of directing: Gump is put into the historical events presenting with the historical big names, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, by switching the scenes of the old documentary with Forrest Gump, which is a milestone in film-making history.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Insidious, Offensive Claptrap","For those of us who do not subscribe to the conservative, Mom's Apple Pie, American Dream twaddle that this film propagates (i.e. Most of the World) then this film is patronising and annoying at best, insidious and offensive at worst. Lets look at the main messages in this film shall we:1) Even if you are a simpleton, don't worry. Tow the line, do as you're told, don't question  war, injustice, corruption, exploitation etc and America will reward you. Remember, if you do want to say anything of worth, make sure the microphone isn't working. 2) Question authority and you will die of AIDS (but lets not mention Homo***uality)All in all a propaganda movie mourning the passing of the 1950's Anglo-White Middle Class America whose myth died with Eisenhower. ""Life is Like a Box of Chocolates""? No I don't think it is really is it?. And as for one reviewer comparing it to Schindler's List - you should be ashamed of yourself.

The best film that I have ever seen,"In my opinion Forrest Gump is the best film I have ever seen. It is incredible how they have managed to fit a man's whole life into one film, that lasts just under two and a half hours, and not compromise on quality. They spend just enough time on every point in the film, so that you get enough detail but still don't get bored.The character may not be considered clever but he still manages a lot in his life. The film sees him achieve a lot from going to war in Vietnam, to being a professional Ping-Pong player. However, The main aspect that keeps popping up in every section is how great he is at running.Tom Hanks portrays the Forrest brilliantly and makes him a unique character unlike any other. The fact that he does not understand the world around him makes the film only funnier, especially in his narrated parts.""They said it was a million dollar wound, but the army must keep that money cause i still ain't seen a nickel of that million Dollars.""Another clever thing about the film is that Forrest always seems to be there when famous events happen, and you see them from his perspective (normally him not understanding what's going on.This film is great spanning across many different genres including romance, drama, action and always comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

I question whether or not even a 13 year-old will fully get this movie as they may or may not know about some of the events that take place. Having said that, because Forrest is such an affable character and has such a true love for Jenny, even an 11 year-old will find this movie fun to watch.If there are any disturbing scenes in this movie, you can easily imagine as to what they are--the suggested abuse Jenny gets from her father , Forrest's encounter with the Black Panthers and former Alabama Governor Wallace and the violent war scenes from Vietnam.Forrest is a great friend and has the most pure and innocent love one can imagine.

A charming romp through modern American history.,"For the longest time, I had only seen pieces of Forrest Gump (1994). After watching it in fits and starts, I finally sat down and watched the whole thing in one go probably ten years ago. Upon re-watching this Best Picture-winner, I realized how it has maintained its cultural appeal for so long. After all, it's not necessarily a story about a slow southern boy; it's the story of history and the story of America. That's not to say it doesn't have its faults, but they're relatively minor compared to the impact of the rest of the film.What's perhaps the most impressive part of Forrest Gump is the visual effects. From digitally inserting the titular character into archival footage to removing a Vietnam War soldier's legs, even knowing these computer-aided elements are there doesn't hinder how real they look. Although, being able to match the visual tone and style of several decades was equally as impressive. It's almost laughable how one character could be a coincidental part of so many iconic events of the late 1900's, but I suppose that's a lot of the charm of this film.My one qualm with this movie also aligns with the spot in the plot where I generally used to stop watching. When the main character starts running across the country with no apparent supplies (water, food, etc.), my suspension of disbelief was broken. If anything, it was only meant as a chance to show off American geography (and move the timeline forward a few years), whereas the previous two hours was primarily American history. Some might also fault Jenny's (Robin Wright) poor life decisions as well, but I think it's merely indicative of what can happen to people who are sexually abused as children.A charming romp through modern American history, I give Forrest Gump 4.5 stars out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

This movie does live up to its standard, and I went in with very high expectations. You will laugh, you may shed a few tears - and you will definitely root for Forrest.

Precision-tuned to win hearts and awards,"Not having seen ""Forrest Gump"" for decades, the online cynicism really started to take hold with me; the American mythology, evil Jenny memes and the obedient simpleton messaging; it put me in a weird headspace for this particular rewatch. But here's the thing: it's just so well-made.No one in this move feels out of place and most of the humor lands as intended. It's not hard to see why this movie swept the Oscars and ticket sales; we're talking Hanks and Zemeckis here, it was a '90s dream team. I'll admit I kinda checked out during the cross-country running scenes, but I was right back in when Haley Joel Osment showed up (it's all heartstrings from there).If there's anything about the movie that doesn't work for me, it's the people around Forrest; most of them end up either sick, ruined or dead, and I had a real problem with that. Jenny fares the worst here, and she honestly deserved better. I hate her father with the power of a thousand suns.I get all of the criticism over the years, I guess I just don't agree.

"Preachy, Simplistic, and Sappy","Great CGI effects & a truly Oscar-worthy performance by Gary Sinise as Lt.

I found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive, Zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of Gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.Watch this film and ask yourself ""What is Robert Zemeckis saying about what makes a good American?""Forrest seems to have made the ""right"" choices and been at the ""right place at the right time"" for the last 45 years.

Waited 22 years to see this movie,"For some reason I always hesitated before watching Forrest Gump and I have no reason why. Finally after years and years being in my watchlist I watched it and indeed it is one of the greatest film of our era. Although I am happy to have watched at more mature age and be able to fully appreciate its meaning.The story telling is impeccable and is able to give you a life lesson on how to let ourself be knocked down and appreciate all the small & big things we have in our lives. The innocence of Forrest perfectly mixes the drama, humour, sadness and war. Furthermore with amazing shots, dialogues and acting
To the few people who have not seen it yet WATCH ASAP. I will definitely not wait as long to see this movie again !",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"When I'm in a bad mood, I will watch this movie","Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what the next one is. Therefore, all we have to do is learn how to taste, instead of complaining about ourselves and exile.
This is where A-Gump's impressiveness lies. He actually has faith. Faith in life, ""Life is like a box of all kinds of chocolates, you will never know what the next one is""; for your determination, when Jenny asked him what he wanted to become in the future, A-Gump only The answer is, ""I will still be myself in the future""; when judging the choice, when someone asks him, are you a fool? Forrest Gump's answer is still simple and profound, because ""only people who do stupid things are fools.""
In addition to the linguistic presentation of A-Gump's beliefs, there is also a moving presentation in the film, which is ""running"". From A-Gump's childhood, running has become A-Gump's life and part of his life. Running made A-Gump free from the foot support, ran across the rugby field, ran through the Vietnam War, and ran across the continent. Behind everything is obviously metaphorical. Running symbolizes the endless life, the firm direction, and the perseverance of the goal. Every step is contagious. Therefore, I think that running is not a kind of consumption, but acquisition, and you will feel that you are more powerful and will not fall into sinking, depravity and confusion. In particular, A-Gump started a three-year running journey after Jenny left.
However, faith always conflicts with certain things, such as fate. What this actually brings is the contradiction between consciousness and reality, the unity of inevitability and chance. In the film, the appearance of feathers almost expresses this kind of entanglement. Feather is drifting in the wind and is helpless, but it has its final destination and dependence. For A-Gump, the biggest joke that fate opened to him was that his best friends, loved ones and lovers all left him one after another. God let him taste the best emotions in the world and let him be lost by loved ones. pain. It's like A-Gump's confession in front of Jenny's grave: I don't know that when we have a destiny, it's not just accidents in life, like floating in the wind, or both.
When faith was hit by fate, A-Gump did not give up on it. This does not affect my judgment that Forrest Gump's life and life are happy. Because the essence of happiness is that you know what you have, no matter whether it is or now, you know that their position and value in your heart are irreplaceable. You know how to cherish, you will not forget them, nor will they. Because, when you have a certain faith, you will move towards your path, you will not be disturbed, you will have a free will, a beautiful heart and noble thoughts and firm actions. This is what A-Gump did, not only to understand but to do it. Since it is right, why not act immediately? Only doing stupid things is a fool! Therefore, A-Gump can reach the other side of happiness and have a paradise of true love.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
so memorable,"I first watched this when i was young, before I had experienced any adult life. So because I could not relate to it as much, since I had not lived it yet, it did not leave that much of an impression on me the first time I saw it. I enjoyed it the first time but that was all. I never thought about it anymore after first seeing.Re-watching now that I'm much older - it is a completely different movie. There are some moments where I just go ""wow"" and can't believe how well they were able to put feelings and emotions into scenes. And it is done so subtly at times if you are not careful you will miss it, such as the just one sentence ""Sometimes I guess there just aren't enough rocks"" Or ""he didn't say it but I think he made peace with his God that night""Although I don't have any learning disabilities like Forest I did end up going through similar problems as him. I've been misunderstood, and many times not even given a chance to be understood.Now that I'm older I too had my own ""Jenny""
Someone that you love almost from the start and they never love you back equally or even at all sometimes. And even when you realize this, you can't make yourself let go 100 percent - because if you could and it that was easy to do then how much did you really love them?The scene when Forrest talks about not remembering certain first things but he does remember the first time ever meeting Jenny that hits home hard.I am jealous of Forrest in many ways.

I wish I could see more of the good in the world like him, I instead notice more of the evil.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Intuitive,Very intuitive and touching story. The story line was incredible funny and intriguing. Forrest was someone away from our lives yet his honesty and love was way beyond his brain development. He was interesting and motivating enough to keep me think and laugh all the time. It's his dedication to everything and his steadfast love make him a person who kept making magic happen.

A coy Republican anthem,"It's an anthem to the American Dream and hymn the country's history in the mid to late 1900's. But it's also an ambitious movie with lots of iconic and funny moments. The main character is the simple ordinary Forrest who finds success in everything just by doing what he's told and following societal conventions without questioning them. Of course, it takes a heaping amount of luck to make it happen but it is satisfying to see the good guy win.The antagonist, of course, is Jenny, who does happen to question society, becomes a counterculture protester, and she ends up dying from AIDS. There's pretty binary system of morality at work in the film and a dearth of actually complex or interesting characters, but whatever it's a movie full of quotable dialogue. Definitely overrated, but good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Forrest Gump: The Overrated Movie of the Century,"In 1994, a mega hit movie came out. Millions of people went to see it in theaters, and adored the lovable main character; Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump later received six academy awards (including best picture and actor), and was even ranked as one of the hundred best American films of all time by the AFI. I pose a question to you, the reader; is something wrong with me? Because Forrest Gump, in my eyes, is, possibly, one of the hundred WORST movies that I've ever seen. Forrest Gump boasts a FAIR performance by Tom Hanks, starring as the title role. That, perhaps, is the best part of this movie, and it was only par. In terms of the story, which could be the worst part of this movie, it is completely pointless. It may be entertaining to watch, but, in the end, it is two and a half hours of a retard (75 I.Q.) prospering in life. This could be a really great movie, but there was no struggle involved. Forrest Gump simply had life and all of his achievements come rushing towards him. Forrest Gump advertises the idea that you can just slide through life effortlessly; that is not true. All in all, Forrest Gump is just a big, overrated disappointment.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

wonderful movie!,"I watched it 4 times and every time I love it even more. ""Forrest Gump"" is a masterpiece that continues to captivate audiences with its timeless story, exceptional performances, and profound emotional impact. Directed by Robert Zemeckis and released in 1994, the film remains a true classic, reminding us of the power of simplicity, love, and the extraordinary potential hidden within ordinary individuals.Tom Hanks delivers a career-defining performance as Forrest Gump, a slow-witted but kind-hearted man who unwittingly becomes an integral part of significant historical events. Hanks brings an incredible depth to his character, portraying Forrest with a childlike innocence and authenticity that is both endearing and remarkably moving. He effortlessly takes us on an emotional rollercoaster, from laughter to tears, and captures our hearts with every step of Forrest's extraordinary journey.""Forrest Gump"" stands out for its exceptional storytelling, weaving together the personal and historical aspects of Forrest's life in a seamless manner. The film skillfully integrates major events of the 20th century, such as the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights Movement, and the Watergate scandal, while cleverly positioning Forrest as an unwitting participant in these historical moments. It not only offers a unique perspective on these events but also highlights the impact one individual can have on the world, regardless of their perceived limitations.The supporting cast is equally outstanding. Robin Wright shines as Jenny Curran, Forrest's childhood friend and lifelong love interest. Her portrayal of a troubled yet resilient character adds depth to the narrative, providing a stark contrast to Forrest's unwavering innocence. Gary Sinise delivers a remarkable performance as Lieutenant Dan Taylor, a complex character who undergoes a transformative journey alongside Forrest. Their interactions are poignant and emotionally charged, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.The film's visual effects and cinematography deserve special mention, as they expertly transport us through time and space. From the bustling streets of Alabama to the horrors of the Vietnam War, each scene is beautifully captured, immersing us in Forrest's world and enhancing the emotional impact of his experiences.What truly sets ""Forrest Gump"" apart is its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions. It skillfully balances humor and wit with moments of heartbreak and introspection. The film explores themes of love, friendship, loyalty, and the pursuit of happiness, leaving audiences contemplating the deeper meaning of life long after the credits roll. It reminds us that success isn't measured by wealth or intelligence, but by the relationships we build and the lives we touch.""Forrest Gump"" is an extraordinary cinematic achievement that has stood the test of time. Its unforgettable characters, powerful storytelling, and profound messages make it a film that resonates with audiences of all generations. It remains a timeless masterpiece, deserving of every accolade it has received. If you haven't experienced the magic of ""Forrest Gump,"" it's time to sit back, relax, and embark on a journey that will leave an indelible mark on your heart.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Wow! I've heard so much criticism but this is a really moving piece,"'Forrest Gump' is a wonderful movie. Forrest grows up as a mentally and physically challenged kid who goes on to inspire others and represent what is good and bad in American life, essentially embodying the idea of 'The American Dream'. The wonderful and clever use of inserting Tom Hanks (as Forrest) into the famous clips of notable people (from JFK to John Lennon) is gimmicky but it works and makes for a marvellous film. The period feeling of he times that Forrest moves through from meeting Elvis to serving in the Vietnam War are so real.

"Great movie, but it has problems","""Forrest Gump"" is a great movie, although some people say it is ""the greatest ever made"" and Tom Hanks' performance is ""the best ever"", quite the contrary, though (actually, not THE contrary).Forrest Gump is a quite remarkable film, but unfortunately, its cheesier than an extra-cheese pizza, and I found that Hanks' performance was a bit overboard, and the film is a bit silly.""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""Pulp Fiction"" were far better films, that lost to Forrest Gump. I found that that was quite bad. Sure, Forrest Gump is good, and fun, but it is nothing compared to Shawshank and Fiction. And Morgan Freeman, John Travolta, Nigel Hawthorne and others who gave remarkable performaces, but lost to Hanks' overblown one.Anyway, that's my 2 cents, Forrest Gump's good, but has a lot of errors, while Shawshank and Fiction were better, and didn't have many errors.""We blew it"" - Easy Rider",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Oh, and to make people not feel guilty about it we'll make Forrest's life materially comfortable.  That this movie won oscars is an affront to the shreds of decency that the Oscars have.  That this movie was passed off as touching is wrong.  I loved Dumb and Dumber, and I see why I am not offended by it:  it does not feign depth or decency.

My opinion of the movie compared to the book.,"Forrest Gump is one of my favorite movies of all time; I even liked the movie more than the book. (Which is rare.) I saw the movie before I read the book; because the movie convinced me to read the book. Naturally, I thought the book would be outstanding because the movie was amazing and usually the books are better than the movie adaptations. The book was good, but had nothing on the movie. Sorry I'm not sorry. The book had a lot of profanity, which I didn't mind until it became overkill. The book does not have the ""run Forrest run"" scenes, nor did Forrest have a brace on his leg. Jenny and Forrest in the beginning of the book didn't even have a good relationship. Also, in my opinion, the book made Forrest have more of a rough personality, while in the movie, although tough, he was a sweetheart. I was so frustrated with the book that I didn't even finish it, it's sitting on my dresser; still containing a bookmark and all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The journey through the life of the dim-witted but ever lovable Forrest Gump is just so touching, funny, sad everything you know from life is represented here in some way.To be honest, there are times when the characterization of Gump as a person with less the average IQ points can be a little too much, but if you look at it through the interplay with the characters he meets, then it becomes an eye-opener.Especially when he is sharing the screen with either his love interest Jenny, the war time comrade Bubba or his stern but loyal lieutenant Dan Taylor. Those characters stay with you in some way, because they are som well written in the context of Forrest's story. The fact that you don't always get on well just because you're smart. Life is harsh, but when it is, look out for your loved ones.And how the technicians managed to mix Tom Hank's person into that footage of historical events is still baffling.

Appreciation of life,"""Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get""
This is one of the first lines spoken in the movie, in one of the first conversations with one of the many people Forrest talks to while he waits for the bus.

In my opinion it tells us that we shouldn't put our weight in the things we don't have, but instead appreciate what we already pocess.

Theme of choosing your own destiny,"Forrest Gump, a comedy and drama film that takes people through history seeing the world through Forrest Gump's (Tom Hanks) eyes. A simple, optimistic, man, with a low IQ score sits at a bus stop as he narrates his flashbacks. It all begins from a young age when his mother, Mrs. Gump (Sally Field) taught him to choose his own destiny. Throughout childhood, Forrest spends his days growing up, going to school and running around with the love of his life, Jenny Curan (Robin Wright). As time progresses, and strangers come and go from the bench and Forrest narrates his experiences from joining the army in Vietnam and making friends with his shrimp- crazed friend, Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) to developing a passion for ping pong and meeting several presidents.While getting to know Forrest's character, the theme of choosing your own destiny captivates viewers as they watch Forrest create his own history. The use of motifs and narration carry out the theme from the opening scene. The film opens up to a feather drifting aimlessly in the air, before landing on Forrest's foot. The feather, that appears again later in the film, is a motif that symbolizes Forrest as he aimlessly goes through life, creating his own destiny wherever the world takes him.Retelling his life events, as he narrates the flashback scenes allows viewers to quickly pick up on Forrest's personality. Although his IQ score is low, it is clear that he is in fact very intelligent and chooses to see the good in situations. While Forrest may be saying one thing, his flashbacks give the audience more depth and layers to the plot. Special effects position historical characters throughout the film to uniquely communicate the passage of time.As his life changes, he doesn't worry about a thing, other than his love for his long- time friend, Jenny.

I love it!,"Forrest Gump is a movie that tells the story of a man named Forrest who faces many challenges throughout his life, including disabilities, bullying, war, and the death of a loved one. Despite these hardships, Forrest approaches life with a positive attitude and a light-hearted spirit. The movie celebrates the importance of accepting oneself and one's limitations, while also recognizing that the most essential things in life come from the heart, not the mind.The film is directed by Robert Zemeckis, who uses advanced visual effects to bring the story to life. The script is well-written, and the soundtrack is rich and vibrant. Tom Hanks delivers a magnificent performance as Forrest, and his character's simple yet profound statement, ""I'm not a smart man, but I know what love is,"" sums up the movie's message perfectly.Forrest Gump takes the audience on a journey through thirty years of American history, all seen from Forrest's unique perspective. The movie teaches us to take life lightly, to glide over things without letting them weigh us down. Forrest's natural optimism and unique approach to life remind us that life is a precious gift, and we should cherish it every day.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"Entertaining and uplifting film with a great and charismatic character, Zemeckis greatest work.","Forrest Gump. Is simply impossible to dislike this film. While it don't has nothing groundbreaking or 'special' about it, is so...pleasant. Is a pleasure to watch this film, really. Is pleasant to the point of being almost a fault. If there is any film that deserves the title of 'greatest crowd-pleaser' , that one for sure is Forrest Gump.It's above all a story about happiness, overcoming, driven by a uplifting atmosphere and involving segments(the Vietnam, the famous ending, the president's meetings) and while it has a few dramatic moments, it never takes itself too seriously to the point of turning the moment in a 'manipulative mess, like some directors usually do. Forrest Gump, believe in it or not, is not a manipulative film. It flows naturally.Tom Hanks is spectacular here. He is brilliant as Forrest Gump, I honestly believed he was 'retarded'. All his child mannerisms were convincing. And the ending is so...great! He watching his kid entering in the bus, realizing that he would suffer the same troubles that himself passed through, is arguably the most heart-breaking scene in the entire film.Thiw film is not really...how can I say...well, Forrest Gump isn't really important for the filmmaking story, like Pulp Fiction is, for example , but still a very good film, regardless. You will not regret watching it. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump has mild nudity, with brief views of the front and the behind of females. Swearing is scattered all over the film, but it is nothing to worry about. A man touches a woman's breast, but nothing is shown. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

But overall this movie is great.Their is so many things about to talk of this movie.but everybody know how the movie is. So i don't thing that i have to say more about the movie.The movie has it all too,drama,comedy and it challenges societal norms as well. Then there are the almost endless quotes from the movie that have slipped into everyday speech. They are too numerous to say at this point.One of the toppers for me in the movie is when Forrest is in a quandary about life and wondering as Lt.Dan said we all have a destiny and his Mom says it is where we are all just floating around like a feather in the wind. Forrest's character terms it very well with this quote,""I think it is a little bit of both."" From my experiences in life it does appear to be that way.

The classic,As far as the film itself goes I think this is a great one. I've always liked how the film took a look at a simple person's life and a simple person who is always in very big situations yet never really understands it. There are countless bits of dialogue that are remembered by mans and they've entered the public IQ but the one dealing with knowing what love is is the one that always caught my attention as far as what this film is about. To me Gump goes through all these historic things yet it's always his love for Jenny that is the heart of the picture.,9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"HEARTWARMING, SURREAL","Forrest Gump is a truly iconic film that leaves the viewer with a melange of emotions and feelings. One can't help falling in love with the hero of this heartwarming story . Forrest Gump, who is the central character stays with us forever and one wishes that his vulnerability, his un-worldly curiosity, his effervescence, his simplicity and child-like spirit can be encapsulated in a vial and sprinkled around the world.The setting of the story is a small town nestled in picturesque Alabama, USA and moves around the life and growing years of young Forrest. He is grappling with several disorders amongst which are a stunted growth in his limbs that restricts his mobility and a learning disability that slows him down. His mother pushes him to accept all his setbacks and surge ahead. His friendship with a little forlorn girl is a turning point in his childhood that pushes him to forget his stunted legs and run like the wind. There is no looking back for him after this prophylactic experience cures him of his lameness and encourages him to run fearlessly.The story captures Forrest Gump's school and college years, and later his recruitment into the army during the Vietnam war. All through the various vicissitudes of his life, Forrest has a natural curiosity to learn and adapt and that quality secures for him some rare friendships, monetary and social success and later a life of comfort. His unrequited childhood romance is a part of his evolution and later in his life, he wins over the love of the woman he always worshipped.Forrest Gump is an eponymous saga, rendered astounding by Tim Hanks epic rendition of Forrest. His struggle thorough life, despite his shortcomings in every sphere, is the soul of the story. It is truly bittersweet, inspiring and uplifting and wins in all aspects of film making.Like Forrest philosophically reinforces through the film, "" Life is a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Excellent,Innocent","""Stupid is as stupid does,"" says Forrest Gump (played by Tom Hanks in an Oscar-winning performance) as he discusses his relative level of intelligence with a stranger while waiting for a bus. Despite his sub-normal IQ, Gump leads a truly charmed life, with a ringside seat for many of the most memorable events of the second half of the 20th century. Entirely without trying, Forrest teaches Elvis Presley to dance, becomes a football star, meets John F. Kennedy, serves with honor in Vietnam, meets Lyndon Johnson, speaks at an anti-war rally at the Washington Monument, hangs out with the Yippies, defeats the Chinese national team in table tennis, meets Richard Nixon, discovers the break-in at the Watergate, opens a profitable shrimping business, becomes an original investor in Apple Computers, and decides to run back and forth across the country for several years. Meanwhile, as the remarkable parade of his life goes by, Forrest never forgets Jenny (Robin Wright Penn), the girl he loved as a boy, who makes her own journey through the turbulence of the 1960s and 1970s that is far more troubled than the path Forrest happens upon. Featured alongside Tom Hanks are Sally Field as Forrest's mother; Gary Sinise as his commanding officer in Vietnam; Mykelti Williamson as his ill-fated Army buddy who is familiar with every recipe that involves shrimp; and the special effects artists whose digital magic place Forrest amidst a remarkable array of historical events and people. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

The Running Soul,"I have to say that Forrest Gump is the movie which serves as a milestone in my life because of its special and unbelievable inspirational power...
I watched the movie when I was during the winter holiday in Grades 11... Before that time...I was like most ordinary students who wasted time on playing computer games and unhealthy videos... I didn't have a dream at that time... I didn't have perseverance at that time... And I didn't have confidence and always be stirred by the others at that time... All in all...I was a loser who forgot he used to be competitive in his childhood...who forgot that his parents loved him a lot but didn't he hid into the room playing games...who despoiled his talent but was not conscious of anything...-That is the context of me at that time...
By accident... the Fortuna even favored me ...who was a pariah ...just when I need her most... My mom sent me to talk with a talented student who had matriculate with MIT... Originally...we were aimed at sharing math-learning experience and I would wait for his advice...however...he ... a brilliant and prospective one...expressed his aspiration for me and urged me to think more about the world outside...which sowed a special seed in my heart... After that talk ...I asked my parents to buy a English-learning book for me and decided to master English...
Though I did work hard at that time...my heart still suspended as I missed computer games and sensory appetite... I was so confused like Pierre Bezkhov when I had to choose only one from sensory satisfaction and my prospective future... Without urge and enough perseverance ...I trespassed my rule over and over again though every time I decided to"" overhaul myself... Though I had an ideal...I didn't own strong heart to defend it... -that is my second phase...
Accidentally...I watched Forrest Gump with my parents in a evening as a so-called recreation... We escorted ourselves in the sofa and waited for watching funny things...However...what I heard was not laugh in the prelude... what I heard was not hilarious actions in the prelude-what I heard was an euphonious and soft music which made me feel I was the feather drifting with wind without knowing the destiny and touched my heart-string powerfully...
...
That was the first time that I watched a movie till 1:00am... After the 142mins watching ... I turned off the TV seemingly silent but a special power rose in my heart meanwhile... That was the first time in my life that I was touched so completely by a movie... Laying on the bed...I thought Forrest has small dream but also trys his best to defend it ... Why can't I? He doesn't care anyone's scoff and doesn't be affected by others'perverse...Why can't I? He loved Jenny truly madly and deeply and deemed her his beacon faithfully...Why can't I own this faith towards my dream? It's time for me to have a run with Forrest in my heart...
I grasped this invaluable chance and discarded my old habits decisivly ... finished the English book at an amazing speed ... I liked reading English books in the corridor and on the way to my home ... I also run to my home after school so that I can save some time to learn Engish-I know this foreign language can take me anywhere ...
With the inspiration left by the movie ... I successfully passed more and more exams and is still on the way to my ideal university-Cornell ... Though it's hard to achieve my dream Forrest Gump is still my sword and shield which will make me stir clear off the obstacles and find the best way...
I am still running and Forrest ... I hope everyone can do...",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

It isn't just a story of a man, but of the generation he was apart of.

A unique film for the soft-hearted!,"Just watched again last Sunday.  I really didn't want to, because I find the film somewhat melancholy, but my girlfriend insisted.  Don't like movies that deal with death and loss all that much.I see a lot of differing opinions about this movie that it was about stupid people from the south, that it's a morality play, that it shows that anyone can succeed.I really don' think that the director wanted to have such a heavy handed obvious movie at all. This movie is like a painting, not a linear story. It was not about the South, Forest Gump, or Vietnam.  It was about life! There were parts of it that were silly, made me laugh, and yeah, tear up (when his mother was sick and dying).So, like every film ever made it has it's flaws and is imperfect.  It will work with some people and not with others.  But I found it to have moments, scenes of mesmerizing beauty that really got to a part of the human soul that a few movies try, but fail to reach.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

"That was great, thank you!","I've seen this one eleven times. No, it is not my record: I've seen Scooby-Doo fourteen times.

I also had a laugh and wondered at the images and the food for thought that is scattered through it. Some people say its message is very conservative, but I believe it manages to be a different movie to every viewer. It is more like a mirror: the way you see it is the way you see yourself. Maybe all films are like that in a way, but this here is a true fable about beliefs. Beyond the tears and laughter, you get to see how chance helps a lot, but mostly it is the way he sees the world that gets the guy the world he gets to live in. I do believe this movie says we should try to be true to our sense of what's good, and that's about all we can do in this crazy wonderful world.

Why the Hate?,"Forrest Gump is a feat in cinematic history. It has set a new (high) standard for movies. So, why the hate?

Forrest Gump has virtually anything you could want in a movie (besides crime). It has action (war violence), comedy, drama, romance... This list could go on and on. I'm simply saying this: this movie is fantastic, I love it, and it is a MUST-SEE for film fans (and anyone else). By the way, I cried, and I have never cried in a movie before.

A feel-good movie the way it's supposed to be made...,"...with class, wit, and genuine pathos, instead of the mawkish tripe of mercenary weepfests like Men of Honor, A Beautiful Mind and (gak) Pearl Harbor. While the creators of such movies meticulously contrive each scene to be a tear-jerking, heart-rending epiphany into the human spirit, the makers of Forrest Gump set out to tell what is simply a great story of one man's life, where all emotion is merely an honest by-product and nothing more. The movie's unique sense of humor makes it clear early on how it doesn't plan to take its subject matter too seriously, and when the occasional sentimental scene does crop up, it's executed in a way that is surprisingly not cloying or embarrassing. At all. Very un-Hollywood.Cliff notes version: Well written, well acted, well done. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

That's Freaks me out!!,"Forrest Gump is the kind of film that shouldn't work on any level. It's as manipulative as a film can ever be, pulling strings and begging the audience to cry, and the entire event is drowned in sticky-sweet syrup. And yet - incredibly - Forrest Gump truly works. It is not without flaw - in fact, it would be nearly impossible to count down all of its many problems - but this film succeeds in being an entertaining, whimsical, and - at times - quite beautiful portrayal of life, love, and 20th century America. And while one would be quick to point to director Robert Zemeckis in regards to the film's success, or perhaps Eric Roth's screenplay, or even Winston Groom's book upon which the film is based, I think the reason this film works, is because of Tom Hank's legendary performance as the title character.Forrest Gump is a slow-witted Alabama native. But indeed, he has extraordinary talent, and an intriguing life story to tell to whoever will sit next to him at the bus-stop.Despite being embraced by - seemingly - everyone, Forrest Gump actually fared less well than critics. It holds a 72% on Rotten Tomatoes, which is a good score, but not a great one. This is largely because Forrest Gump will not appeal to the cynical. And Lord knows that film critics get enough hate as it is, but there's simply no two ways about it: Film critics, generally speaking, are more cynical than the average movie-goer. Those willing to accept the occasionally preposterous nature of the film and the sometimes cloying sentimental tone will find a lot to enjoy. But if you've never quite cottoned to the sappier efforts of Steven Spielberg or renaissance Disney, you may find Forrest Gump to be an eternal 142 minutes.One of the problems with Forrest Gump is that the film goes to exceedingly great lengths to make Forrest as endearing and likable as possible. And honestly, it wasn't necessary; he's already a likable character. Additionally, Forrest Gump just seems to be an expert at everything. When we learn he's an incredibly fast runner, we buy that. But after we learn he's incredible at putting guns together, playing ping-pong, etc., things get a little stale.On top of that, Forrest Gump also has a running gag in which Forrest turns out to be the originator of several pop culture staples, from one of Elvis Presley's dance moves, to the creator of the ""smiley"" face, etc. Forrest Gump spends so much time winking at the audience, one begins to ponder the likelihood of contracting an eye-lid blister.In spite of the film's many problems, however, Forrest Gump is a good film, largely thanks to Tom Hanks. His performance adds an element of genuineness and sincerity to the picture, thus balancing the syrupy sap. On paper, the Forrest Gump character comes off as cloying, but when you see Tom Hanks portray this character, it not only works, it comes to life. This is not a case of a great performance making a decent film worth seeing. This is a great performance that elevates everything surrounding it. It gives the movie a classy nature that makes the sentiment feel earned.There are genuine moments of beauty and grace. In fact, some sequences are almost stunningly beautiful. When the film eases back a little on the sweetness, it has an old-fashioned appeal to it, and an unmistakable charm in the aesthetics of the picture.The visual effects are superb. Forrest Gump seamlessly blends with the archival footage in an effect that still holds up today. Even more impressive - to my eyes, anyway - is the effect used for a character who has lost his legs in the war, and must function without them.I've already praised Hanks' performance, but the rest of the cast is worth noting too. Robin Wright plays Forrest's love interest, Jenny, in a more serious role. She captures the depth of the character, and is never as annoying as she might have been in less capable hands. Gary Sinise as Dan Taylor delivers a performance that's absolutely marvelous, and even giving Hanks a bit of a run for his money. Sinise's performance is powerful and gripping. Sally Fields portrays the most charming of the cast, Forrest's mother, in a sweet but memorable supporting role. Michael Conner Humphreys and Hanna R. Hall portray young Forrest and young Jenny respectively in excellent child performances.Alan Silvestri's score is very pretty, but it receives an absurdly little amount of screen time. It gets two major appearances (other than the credits), and that is the very beginning, and the very end. You hardly hear it at all the rest of the film, which is largely populated with obnoxious, time-period- accurate, pop and rock songs. While they are interesting from a stylistic point of view, they are simply atrocious from a musical one. They end up stealing a lot of screen time that would have been better served by Silvestri's much more palatable musical score.Forrest Gump is heavily flawed, but it has some wonderful moments. Tom Hanks gives the performance of his life, and despite too much sweetness at times, the film is a real charmer. The acting is great, the screenplay is great, the score is great, and the characters are great. The over- sentimentality brings the film down a bit at times, but it's hard to imagine that too many people would leave Forrest Gump without feeling at least a little better about life.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump,"""Forrest Gump"" is a heartwarming film that combines elements of drama, comedy, and historical commentary. Its a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis, based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Winston Groom. The cast led by Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump, alongside Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field, and Mykelti Williamson. It is a story that celebrates the power of love, friendship, and perseverance, and it reminds us that even the simplest person can make a difference in the world. In the opening scene, Forrest introduces himself to the audience and tells us a little bit about his life. He explains that he is sitting at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia, waiting for a bus to take him to Memphis, Tennessee. He also tells us that he has a low IQ, but that his mother always told him that ""life was like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get."" which is one of the MOST iconic phrases I've heard and stayed with me since I was little. Forrest Gump's journey takes him from the American South in the 1950s to the Vietnam War to the halls of power in Washington, D. C. Along the way, he meets and interacts with some of the most iconic figures of the 20th century, including Elvis Presley, John F. Kennedy, and Richard Nixon.n Throughout his journey, Forrest remains true to himself, and he maintains his kind and optimistic outlook on life. He is a character who inspires us to be our best selves, even in the face of adversity. ""Forrest Gump"" is a truly special film and one of my favorites that has resonated with audiences for over two decades. The narration in the film ""Forrest Gump"" is one of its most distinctive and memorable elements. The story is told from Forrest's own perspective, and his unique voice and worldview are evident in every word. Forrest is a simple and straightforward storyteller, but his insights into life are profound. He speaks with a kind and optimistic tone, even when recounting difficult experiences. His narration is also full of humor, and he often finds the funny side of even the most serious situations. The film's director, Robert Zemeckis, has said that he wanted the narration to sound ""like Forrest was talking to you over a cup of coffee."" This approach creates a sense of intimacy between Forrest and the audience, and it allows us to connect with him on a personal level. The narration also plays an important role in the film's structure. Forrest's flashbacks are triggered by seemingly random events, such as a feather falling from a tree or a stranger's remark. This gives the film a sense of spontaneity and unpredictability, which mirrors Forrest's own life experiences. The narration is also used to highlight the film's themes of love, friendship, perseverance, and the randomness of life. Forrest's story shows us that even the simplest person can make a difference in the world, and that even the most difficult challenges can be overcome with love and determination.",,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Forrest Gump- timeless classic,"Directed by Robert Zemekis, Forrest Gump is an endearing story of the trials and victories of Forrest (played by Tom Hanks) from the time he was a boy through adulthood, and an all-time fantastic movie. We see the challenges of being bullied as a young boy for being ""different"" from his peers, and we see how Forrest's mom (Sally Field) is his biggest cheerleader. We watch as he gets his one and only friend Jenny (Robin Wright Penn) and see their relationship blossom over the years. Forrest and Jenny ""are best good friends"" and are there for each other through all phases and stages of life. The layering of visible and invisible sound allows the viewer to actually feel as if they are present in the film. The use of creative editing makes the appearance that Forrest Gump is present for many of history's meaningful moments including the Vietnam War, being in the presence of President Nixon, President Kennedy, among other events.

One of the best films of the 90's.,"Such a beautiful movie, i believe everyone has a right to their opinion about films or other topics. However from a lot of the comments I have read about this film, I do not think many got the gist of the message from the author and the film maker. This film is a great modern fable, a fable in the dictionary is defined as a brief fictitious story that teaches a moral. There are many morals defined in this film but foremost is integrity and a simple goodness.I have a half brother who grew up in the Southern U.S. and on one occasion we were discussing this film and he said he felt it portrayed Southerners as dimwitted. I disagreed with him and informed him that the author himself was a native Southerner. The setting is central to this story in that it lets the tale unfold tying in factual events with the fable before us.The film is wonderfully directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film is his opus and is acted by a great cast on all levels. From the children who were Forrest Gump and Gump Jr. by Haley Joel Osment. Say what you want but I feel Tom Hanks deserved the Oscar award. Gary Sinise is synonymous with Lt.Dan whenever you hear those words. Sally Fields is the loving dutiful mother in her challenging situation. Mykelti Williamson as Bubba gives you a real sense in the story that Gump had a genuine friend, he moves you with his character. Words don't grasp the full performance of Robin Wright Penn as Jenny. Jennys' tenderness and pain are palpable as exhibited by Wright.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
An Unforgettable Classic,"Forrest Gump sums up American pop culture from the 60s to the 90s. The impossible to dislike protagonist Forrest Gump takes the film on an unforgettable journey through some of America's most famous moments.

Every single aspect of the film falls together perfectly, the supporting cast, cinematography, and especially the soundtrack give this movie everything it needs. At times, it may seem cliché and unrealistic, but its really the heart of this movie that makes you fall in love with it. Forrest Gump is a must see for everyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A sensitive journey through a tumultuous America,"Arguably Tom Hanks' finest example of his acting range, Forrest Gump is about as challenging a role a modern actor could be charged with: trying to merge compassion and inadvertent humour alongside mental impairment is a recipe for disaster, but Hanks navigates it flawlessly. The incidents of Watergate, Vietnam and several presidencies are retold through the life of a boy-turned-man swept up by these current affairs, all whilst trying to get back to his childhood love Jenny (Robin Wright).By having several stories contained within one film, emotional ties are given more value, spanning years and experiences. In particular, Forrest's relationship with Lt. Dan (Gary Sinese) is enduring, lasting even after the events during their time in Vietnam. Several large historical events are (somewhat fictionally) retold, with Forrest managing to crop up in the most unlikely places - however, his naivety shines through, giving the film a lighthearted touch that can be lost when tackling issues as serious as war and racism.Forrest Gump's brilliance is through making a scene funny one second, before pulling on heartstrings the next. This seamless transition is a true feat in cinema, represented by Forrest Gump's overwhelming success (winning 6 Oscars in 1995). This film is also truly unique in its ability to be entertaining for almost any demographic - represented by its enduring success 25 years later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Ridiculous,"This is one of the most ridiculous and over-hyped movies of all time, and the sole reason I stopped liking Tom Hanks as an actor.

Beautiful film,"This is a powerful yet charming movie; fun for its special effects and profound in how it keeps you thinking long after it's over. Like others, I've seen this movie more than once. It's so damn funny when Jenny dies.Granted, he achieves this only because he doesn't have the brains to think otherwise and actually have expectations, but so many of our problems are because we do have higher intellect and desires, which ironically makes us unhappy because we know what we are missing. We love our cats and dogs for the same simplicity and always being in the moment. There's a line in the movie wondering if everything is predestined or happens randomly or it's a combination of both. It is something to mull over for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

Don't Eat Too Many Chocolate or You'll Get a Tummy Ache,"Forrest Gump, I first met you back in 1994 in the midst of the great American hype over you. I thought you were an OK guy but was let down and disappointed, I thought based on my unrealistic expectations.Almost 30 years later I decided to pay you another visit and see how you've aged. You know what, I still think you seem like a nice enough guy but this time I found the writing, and story all a bit lazy and pandering. All those American events and touchstones of the last 20th century, along with the soundtrack, it was all so 'on-target' that you didn't really have to both with the story and unique character development to touch the viewers emotions.

Only In America,"I remember the BBC coverage of the Oscars in 1995 . Barry Norman was asking the Brits in Hollywood - Among them Tracey Ullman and Alan Parker - what they thought of the years nominations and the British view was unanimous that FORREST GUMP was nothing more than an overated mediocre movie . After seeing the film for myself I`ve got to agree with the standard British view - This is an overated mediocre movieIt`s impossible to believe anyone outside America could love this movie . The overated ( Third time I`ve used that word in this review ! ) Tom Hanks plays Forrest the local town idiot who experiences many of the truimphs and torments of 1950s 60s and 70s America , and it`s all produced , played and written in a sickly sweet way , so sickly sweet you should watch this with a bucket in your hand so you don`t get any vomit on the carpet.Amazing fact .

As do his very talented co-stars, including, Gary Sinise as his vietnam commanding officer Sally Feild as his loving mother and Robin Write as his friend for life Jenny.We see many things happen to Forrest in his life, from wearing braces on his legs as a youngster, to him meeting Jenny, and through almost 30 years he sees some of the most unforgettable events in history.He touches many lives including Bubba (Mykelti Williamson) another mentally challenged man, Captain Dan (Sinise) who is crippled during the war.This is a film where you either love it or hate it.

Hollow,"Well, if you are in the mood for a hollow ""feel good movie"" this will fit the bill. But if you are looking for substance, or a film that makes you think, this film will leave you knowing you can never get the time back you just spent watching this movie. The soundtrack probably causes movie-goers to connect to the film more than the flimsy plot.At the time this film was released, Hanks was perhaps the most sought after leading man. In some ways, it is as though the studios were on a quest to turn him into his generation's Jimmy Stewart. Hanks is a solid actor, and has acted in many excellent roles, but this is not one of them. But this film certainly helped launch the ""Bubba Gump Shrimp Company Restaurant"" found at tourist traps all across the United States. In many ways, that is this film's legacy - made for theater tourist looking for a vacation for the mind.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
Inspirational,"I watched this movie yesterday and I am still feeling overwhelmed. Definitely a well-deserved academy award of best actor for Tom Hanks for his marvelous performance in this movie.We often value intelligence and look for it in people, but the other values; of just being good, pure, and kind, are just as important.I know this movie is fictitious but you don't necessarily have to have a high IQ to be successful. Sometimes it just takes courage, determination, and loyalty to be good at something. The protagonist condition made him less aware of the emotions of fear and worry, which usually plays a big role in creating obstacles for us.The force of love was very present in the movie.

"An entertaining film, but by far not the classic it's destined to become.","I found this an entertaining movie to watch, nothing more, nothing less. I have one major reason for being negative about this film: it portrays a man who is able to attain the 'American Dream' without any intelligence. However much we can admire him for that, I'm afraid that the message being sent out is that you don't need education or smarts and that everything will come to you as if laid by a golden goose. Surely this is not what the movie makers intended but that's the way it came across on me.Besides that I must say that Tom Hanks does an excellent acting job, and for that alone the film is actually worth watching...but not a classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
A dullard's Citizen Kane...,"Why do people love this movie?  This movie is not only completely unrealistic, it's also boring.  Almost everyone I know who saw this movie and wasn't middle aged said they liked the movie but it was too long and kind of or too boring.  Does that make sense?  When looking back at this movie, did it really give you anything back?  This movie is illogical, stupid, pointless, and umm... like before I get too redundant, annoying.  I was hoping that Forrest Gump would die in the war or like get hit by a car when he was running.  That would have been hilarious and then this movie could have been up there with Toxic Avenger and Braindead.  And the Academy Awards are a joke.  They don't recognize really good movies usually, and I'm stil in shock that American Beauty won since it actually deserved an Oscar. I seriously think that Demolition Man or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was a better movie.  At least Wesley Snipes had a cool hairstyle.  Go rent a classic like Vanilla Ice's Cool as Ice or C.H.U.D...  Forrest Gump sucks and isn't he more like an anti hero?

he knows best what love is,"Jenny always said, Gan, you don't know what love is.But I think he knows best what love is.Gump loves his mother.Of course, his mother was also a great mother. She loved her son with all her life, never being stingy with the love he deserved because of Gump's intellectual disability. She made Gan grow up very happy, and because of this, Gan can have a pure and flawless heart.Mother is the most impressive word in the world, no matter how big the difference in language, the pronunciation of the two words will always be similar.Women are weak, but mothers are strong.In fact, I think Gump's mother is proud, she raised such a good son.Gump loves his friends.On the battlefield in Vietnam, he risked his life to save another comrades-in-arms, and in the most dangerous moments, he resolutely returned to the jungle about to be bombed out, in order to ""buford is my best friend, and I know that good friends are not so easy to find."" Remembering his engagement with Buford, he bought a shrimp boat, realized a friend's dream, and funded his family.Dan is the hero of Gan's heart, has always been, he so firmly believe, such a strong belief finally let Dan also muster up the courage to live. Dan said he hadn't thanked Gump, but the best thing he could do was live. Gump never felt like he'd done anything, everything seemed natural to him, something he should have done. We are too complicated to think that he has done things that mortals can't do, but in Agam's world, those are very common small things.Gump loves his girl.Jenny was unhappy, and her life had been miserable, wandering around without warmth. But she was lucky again, because she met Gump and the best love in the world. Maybe Jenny wouldn't have thought that her words had changed Agam's life's waiting, but also a happy ending. Her life was full of misery, but in the end, she finally fell asleep forever under the only tree that brought her warmth.Jenny is Gump's only one, because it's only one and eternal.What impressed me the most was that Agam said in front of Jenny's grave, ""Call me whatever you want, I won't go too far,"" and indeed, in Agam's heart, Jenny will always be alive. He loves her, so he doesn't care if she loves him. His life will always remember that angelic little girl on the school bus, she smiled at him, she looked at the stars with him, she told him to run all the time don't look back... Although Jenny did not always accompany him, there are traces of Jenny in Agam's life.So, in fact, all the dead have not disappeared, and Agam has the memory of all the people, as long as he is alive, they are there.Gump loves his children.He sent his children a school bus, just as his mother had sent herself a school bus when he was a child. Everything was the same as it had been many years ago, except this time, there would not be a little angel like Jenny in the car.In Agan's eyes, his mother, his friends, his girl, his children... He was an angel, but he didn't know that he was an angel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"
"Excellent film, somewhat disappointing ending","This here is just as good as you may've heard, it's one of those films that develop legendary status as the years and decades pile on, and it delivers on the quality expected from all the hype. The story is based on a novel, which explains the excellent structure of the plot but the directing was very competent in making this a moving, genuinely thought-provoking and interesting piece of art. It belongs in the category of long, drama films, but it never gets 'long' and the 'drama' never gets over-dramatic. The tension is excellently managed, the acting is very good, and in spite of its said long run-time the films is filled with events, meaningful characters and very good dialog, and it never concedes to self-complacency - objectively this is strong cinema through and through. True quality. The Gary Sinise character who represents the human ego, and Gump as a symbol that intelligence of the heart is infinitely superior and more valuable than intelligence of the mind. The only true concern for an easy-going, indulgent movie viewer is that the film builds such tremendous momentum, is so flawlessly told and crafted, that one would certainly expect an adequately superb finish, an emphatic ultimate exclamation point; not something extraordinarily life-changing but something rich in the same emotion and genuinely interesting/profound quality the whole film as a platform had built seamlessly for two hours plus. Such great classic stories end with a beautiful and fulfilling sense of utter satisfaction, and this does seem to fall slightly short of that, so it may not merit a full grade.8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

With his below average IQ, and low wit, he had been present in numerous occasions of historical importance, he reveals his life story, and how he had been in each and every one of the events, and how he tried to pursue the love of his life, Jenny.Tom Hanks at his finest, great performance by everyone in the cast, and overall made it one epic movie to watch.

Best Picture? Not really.,"I find it interesting that this picture won an Oscar over Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption, BOTH of which were better movies, in my opinion.I also find it interesting that Robin Wright as Jenny wasn't nominated, when I thought her performance was one of the GOOD things about the movie. She seemed to be the only person involved with the film the Academy ignored that year.The movie wasn't terrible, but it was too long, overly sentimental and not especially memorable.

Either the director missed the point or I did,"After becoming increasingly disenchanted throughout this seemingly endless film, I began to wonder what the message, if any, was. It appeared to me that the theme was that it didn't matter if you were an idiot, things would work out fine so long as you are American and your hearts is pure. Some time after seeing the movie I read extracts from the original book which was clearly of more satirical intent. Forrest Gump is a modern day Candide living out a pseudo-panglossian idyll where everything works out for the best (in this best of all possible worlds.) While the book clearly highlights the absurdity of this, the movie takes a superficial view that illustrates the situations without any apparent understanding of irony.",3.0,Anonymous,"Drama, Romance"

10,"At first glance, it seems a bit dimwitted Forrest, silly boy, but his kindness and simple outlook on life to persuade the audience throughout the film.

He just does what he likes. And for those who doubt if they were, then they evaporate when Forrest is not just a father.The whole life of Forrest -neobyknovenny kaleidoscope of situations in which it is directly or indirectly affect the course of American history, and does it unconsciously, and sometimes a child himself. He taught Elvis to dance and made him famous, he was three times at a reception at the president, he founded the «Apple Computers, Inc» and came up with the famous shirt with smiles and popular slogan «Shit happens».The Life and Strange Surprising Adventures of Forrest for me is the story of an amazing and extraordinary man. A real person. Forrest Gamp- is the quintessence of the whole person.

I feel sorry for them, as they just don't get the simple message that shines throughout the movie.For others (I hope we are a majority), we see Forrest as a gateway to our own soul.

Tom Hanks is one of the best actors that I have ever seen and his portrayal of the slightly dim but warm hearted Forrest Gump is just one of the many examples of this. The plot is very cleverly interwoven with very memorable historical events making us relate and love the character Gump even more. To say that this film is over-rated is to be blind to the pure genius that is the whole story. If it is such a bad film then why would it have been nominated for so many awards? Why did Tom Hanks win an oscar for it? Finally, why is it repeated on TV all the time with thousands upon millions of viewers tuning in to watch Forest's trials and tribulations, slowly but surely falling in love with his character and watching with disgust at Jenny as she fails to notice this sweet, kind and caring man infront of her and chooses the guys who will only let her down time and time again. When I see that film, I always cry, and call me sentimental if you want I can't help but relate to this poor boy who just wants the simple life without having all these people entwined with him, many presidents, Elvis, Chinese world ping-pong champions and the first ever black people to be allowed in white schools!
