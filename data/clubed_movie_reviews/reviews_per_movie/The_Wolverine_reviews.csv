What Might Have Been,"This is basically a tale of two movies. I know Hugh Jackman wanted this movie to be an adaptation of the classic Chris Claremont/Frank Miller comic book mini-series. You can see bits of that story here. But then you have this other stuff, far removed from that story, that seems to be studio-imposed and ultimately hurts what could have been one of the best comic book movies to date. The good stuff, the stuff worth watching this for, are the slower, quieter parts of the story. The Wolverine and Mariko parts, basically. But all of the special effects-heavy parts and the loud, flashy action sequences suck and take away from the impact the movie would have otherwise had. There's probably no better example than the different climactic battle scenes. Wolverine vs Shingen is a much more powerful, emotional scene than the shallow, garish stuff with Viper and a guy in robot armor.I don't really blame James Mangold. No doubt it was Fox's interference that caused the problems and also caused Darren Aronofsky to bail before filming. You can see a better movie underneath this one. But Fox didn't have the guts to make that movie. Probably felt it wasn't commercial enough. Needed more robots and CGI fights on top of a speeding train. Still, it's good enough to watch and enjoy most of it. It's certainly miles better than the last Wolverine movie. But I can't help but feel sad thinking about what might have been. They very well could have given Wolverine his own 'Batman Begins' but instead we get just another watchable popcorn movie with hints at something more substantial.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
biased review of Wolverine fan,"I've been a fair fan of the series of the whole. Even the weaker installments I thoroughly enjoyed, so my review is already weighed in favor of this film. I will say even from a critics point of view I thought it was really well done. It's not the standard comic book fairy tale, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than previous installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found interesting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who provided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests. I found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after all the time we've get to see him in all his cinematic installments.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worthy successor,"I didn't much care for X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Hugh Jackman still was, and always will be, a brilliant Wolverine, but the other characters felt lackluster, the villain was weak and the storyline didn't fit well with the other X-Men movies. It didn't have the same feel.For some time it seemed that the poor critical performances of both that and X-Men 3 would mean there would be no more movies with Wolverine in them, at least in a leading role. Luckily, the film makers decided to do one more and if this particular movie is going to be the last one, I for one can move on happy with what I got.The Wolverine is a movie that works both as a continuation of the X-Men storyline, as well as a standalone movie. The focus is kept heavily on Hugh Jackman, which works for the movie's advantage. There are some callbacks to the events of the trilogy, but as a whole I think this film could have worked just as well without them, if not better, as they are a bit distracting from time to time. But most of the time the focus is on where it should be. In this movie Logan travels to Japan in order to meet an old acquaintance, who wants to settle old scores before his demise. In Japan we get some gorgeous scenery, nice atmosphere, intriguing settings, believable characters, all that good stuff.I especially liked Tao Okamoto's character Mariko, the granddaughter of Wolverine's old friend. Jackman and Okamoto have brilliant chemistry together and when the movie slows down during the second act to give them time to simply interact with one another, it feels justified. Usually that kind of slowing down in an action movie feels boring and unneeded, even sappy, but here it works because the actors have the skills to pull it off. Which is a great thing, because it gives the movie more depth and we get a chance to know Wolverine in a new way that the Origins movie tried to reach, but never could because of its lack of emotional maturity.Unfortunately this film has one major flaw and that is the unbelievably weak villain, known as Viper. Her actress, Svetlana Khodchenkova, just doesn't have the screen presence or acting skills to give the character any memorable attributes. She merely stands there, struts around in her skintight suit and spouts the dialogue. That's it. Sure part of that is poor writing, but it's still rather jarring because the two main protagonists are so damn good. If only the villain had been as good, this could easily have been one of the best Marvel movies yet made.As it is, it's still fine. The two main characters are very good, most of the side characters do a good job as well, the action works wonderfully, the Japanese setting gives the film a nice coating of majesty and even the story, while nothing that extraordinary, functions well enough for us to enjoy it. The villain is weak, very weak in fact, which keeps the film from being great, but you can overlook it and focus on the good stuff.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine,Wolverine plus Samurai makes a pretty good combination for me. A great film that is based on the X-Men comic books and movie series.,,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This could be the Wolverine movie fans always wanted.,"2009's X-men Origins: Wolverine was received negatively by both critics and the majority of the fans of the character. Now the character has a chance to redeem himself with this year's the Wolverine and for the most part he does. This film has really tried to please the fans as it was loosely based on the beloved Japan story line from the comics and it is clear that the film has tried to fix the problems that were complained about in the previous solo Wolverine film. Despite taking place after the events of X-men: The Last Stand this film attempts to distance itself from the rest of the X-men characters and story and focuses solely on the Wolverine character and as a result this film feels very different to all previous X-men films. This allows for the best portrayal of Wolverine's character that we have seen so far and Hugh Jackman also delivers his best performance of the character to date. I really enjoyed the pacing of the film as well because although it was a face paced action film it wasn't afraid to slow things down and develop the characters and the relationships between them. However it never slows down for too long before it picks up the pace with another action scene. The action in this film is also very well done because every sequence is creative and has a purpose so it never feels like the mindless action we've come to expect in big budget summer films. Humour is also used effectively in this film as the writers take advantage of Wolverine's IDGAF attitude. However the film isn't perfect as there is one other mutant character that occasionally seems slightly out of place and some people might find her character a bit too over the top. Also from time to time it does feel like they are playing it too safe to insure that they don't make any of the same mistakes as the last Wolverine film. Overall The Wolverine, although not perfect, is a fun superhero film that gets a lot of things right about what makes the Wolverine character so popular.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Back to Basics!,"Wolverine is one of the iconic characters in both the Marvel Universe as well as the 20th Century Fox's movies; so is his Adamantium claws and healing factor. An immortal and living through ages he does have a lot of stories ready to be told through movies/comics. We did get an Origin movie, X-Men Origins Wolverine which was panned by critics and audiences alike. But I felt it was trashed more than it deserved to be. It had loads of action and bits from the original Wolverine Origin story arc but it did trash the character for the sake of being an action-heavy summer blockbuster. A weak script, irrelevant characters and a stupid take on 'the merc with a mouth' underwhelmed the audiences. Anyways The Wolverine salvages some of its lost prestige putting a lot of focus on the core character.Rumors that Darren Aronofsky'd be helming the new Wolverine had me excited but the director's chair was handed over to James Mangold in the end. I am not skeptic at all regarding Mangold's directing prowess, as evident from gems like 3:10 to Yuma, Walk the line and Identity. But I was wondering how he'd handle a superhero flick. After watching it, its safe to say Mangold's direction is far better than what I'd expected it to be.The Wolverine is undoubtedly based on Frank Miller's take on the superhero and I was already familiar with the names Mariko, Shingen and Yukio. It all came like a whiff of fresh air. The Wolverine is sort of a reboot for the series and a brilliant stepping stone for a new franchise which could tell a parallel story to the X-Men movies. Although it has its roots attached to the previous flicks, we are dropped into the midst of Wolverine's story. There ain't no origin, there ain't no 'Previously'; instead we are just dropped into a narrative which ploughs forward to the thick of Japan. The Wolverine could be compared to treatment our superheros been getting recently. He's been stripped off his healing factors and he is left like so almost the entire movie and it does bring out some tension. I mean when he had the healing power, we knew he wouldn't just die even if she's split into two (admit it!)The Wolverine is directed well and so was it well written and the action sequences well choreographed but its not without its flaws though. As mentioned above The Wolverine still has the debris it's carried on from X-Men The Last Stand and I wasn't pleased with it. Wolverine has flashbacks of his lost love? Seriously? Isn't it time his healing factor took care of that already? I mean its the god-damn Wolvie we're talking about here. Jean Grey's flashbacks (more like boring nightmares and more than once) kept crawling into the plot disrupting the pace and I just didn't like it. Of course Wolverine is tormented from what he'd done in the past but that doesn't mean, we the audience need to be tormented from start to end. The Japan setting was a bit distracting as well and maybe thats a personal thing. I am not a big fan of Martial arts movies and there was an excess of martial arts settings and jargon here in the movie though it all did look good. Props were fantastic and the action sequences thick, especially the Bullet Train sequence is something to gape at.Hugh Jackman effortlessly steps into his Wolverine shoes for the 6th time and having worked with Mangold in Kate & Leopold did wonders for The Wolverine. This is the Logan we've all praised and been used to and Hugh easily slides into the role and storyline straight from X-Men The Last Stand albeit forgetting X-Men Origins Wolverine. But then again playing Wolverine would have become second instinct for Hugh by now. Supporting cast couldn't be praised for the same, most of them being just bait for the plot. Especially Wolverine love interest in the movies, I felt they had absolutely no chemistry. Rila Fukushima did an absolutely splendid job playing Yukio. I had huge expectations for Svetlana Khodchenkova who played the only other mutant in the movie, Viper but she just served for some eyecandy and wasn't even fleshed up to be a proper antagonist.For what its worth, The Wolverine is a splendid action movie which concentrates more on the character and the plot than heavy heavy action sequences. If you are an X-Men/Wolverine fan you are gonna love it and please do stay back after the credits coz there is a monumental end- credit to be seen there.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Incredible spin-off,"Despite the third act being drastically different in tone to the previous two acts (but it's still fun and enjoyable), The Wolverine is an incredible spin-off that's thrilling and emotional, showing the effects of the events of X-Men 3 on Wolverine/Logan. Hugh Jackman gives a reliably incredible performance as Wolverine once again. Hiroyuki Sanada and Rila Fukushima both give great supporting performances. James Mangold's direction is great and the action sequences are fantastic. The music by Marco Beltrami is really good.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A middling sequel,"This film is like a prototype of Logan (2017), trying to achieve a weary, violent film revolving around Wolverine, but not quite hitting the same mark. Compared to its predecessor X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), it's better in some ways but actually is worse in others. On the plus side, the plot is far more comprehensible and the action is not very silly until the end. The small scale of the film was quite a departure for the X-Men franchise and only the fleeting inclusion of another mutant makes it relevant. While some might appreciate this realistic setting, I didn't find the Japanese corporate conspiracy plot very engaging. The film slowed down too much at times as the action scenes got repetitive (other than an interesting sequence on top of a train). While the film is not as silly as its predecessor, it's unfortunately not as interesting either.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyment will depend on familiarity.,"First and foremost I must say that I absolutely loved this movie. But as I will cover in my review it may largely be due to the fact that I have always held the source material of this film in very high regard. Having said that, I do recognize that their may be a sliding scale of enjoyability for this film. If you are a fan of the 1983 Claremont/Miller miniseries of Wolverine then this is the movie you have been waiting for. If you are fond of the character Wolverine and interested into delving deeper into his chronology and exploring his inner conflicts, you will certainly enjoy this movie. If however, you have no familiarity, or no desire to familiarize with the character of Wolverine, you may find yourself not caring about many of the slower moments and longing for a more evenly paced action film.Fans of Claremont's Wolverine rejoice, this Wolverine does it right. The film does its best keeping characters intact while deviating from the comics in the sake of a self contained story and grander character development. There are several of the shots in this film that are near recreations of the comic's original panels, and although story lines have been shifted and shuffled in some places, its all there. Mariko, Yukio, Harada, Shingen and Viper may develop differently than in the comic series, but their relation to each other and contextual significance is intact. As a Wolverine fan it was also nice to see a meaningful relationship blossom between Wolverine and Mariko, unlike the comics where it really is love at first sight. Instead here Wolverine falls in love not entirely with the character of Mariko, but rather with the idea of being a protector, a take that is a welcome addition to the Claremont storyline. The characters of Silver Samurai and Viper undergo the largest facelift in this film, but it isn't entirely out of place. Let us not forget they were involved in the X Men issues directly connecting to the Wolverine miniseries. Although their characters have undertaken slight adjustments in order to incorporate ideas from the Fatal Attractions storyline, the plot does well to take from Wolverine's side of this storyline because it was one of the few times in the series where Logan did feel vulnerable. Many fans will recognize that the plot device and character of Master Yashida cannot be found in any of the original comics, but one must keep in mind it serves as a useful device to connect all the developments of Logan's journey. All in all I think its the best character study of Wolverine that any fan could ask for. Wolverine struggles with his animalistic urges and his commitment to reform, he grapples to find meaning in his endless immortality, and he ultimately finds purpose and resolution that he had not before. None of these developments are significantly or profoundly discovered, rather they are slowly revealed, which may turn casual movie goers off from enjoying this film. As a thoughtful exploration of Wolverine's character and a grand homage to incredible source material though, how can any Wolverine fan say no to this movie? It is the best X-Men movie and one of the best comic based movies.For those who would not consider themselves fans, but are rather moviegoers intent on enjoying a superhero epic, be warned. This film is a character study, it does not grapple with any conflicts outside of Wolverine's internal struggles. The world is not being threatened, and not many lives outside of Logan's are even being threatened, so the storyline does not crescendo in epic suspense like the Avengers or the Dark Knight. So for those not invested in Wolverine's personal self discovery, some of the action can seem unmotivated and the pacing an obstacle to satisfaction. The film does its job in providing action sequences, but it intersperses several moments of symbolic soul searching, cryptic metaphors and relationship building that serve as pavement for Wolverine's self discovery. This movie can still be enjoyable without interest in Wolverine's inner conflicts however. With an outstanding supporting cast, a beautiful setting, and gripping and intense action sequences, it plays a lot like a token Bond film for those unfamiliar with Wolverine.Whether you are familiar with the original comics or not, this movie will certainly provide entertaining thrills and intriguing themes. If, however, you are a fan of the original comic books, this film is a wonderful achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Tremendously Smart and Engaging. A Joy To Watch!,"If there's one major element that truly sets this picture apart from any other standard ""solid"" comic book movie is the way through which the director communicates the experience of being Wolverine. His healing factor and the idea of out-living everyone you know is daunting and depressing. Finding purpose after facing true vulnerability adds so much to the character and FAR more than we've seen before. Tremendous visual and emotional imagery is presented throughout the movie and provides the viewer with greater insight into the hero and even the villains. This one screams quality from the opening through the amazing final act. I've seen it mentioned that the resolution deviates from the comic books but I honestly couldn't care less. What hits the screen more then works in movie form.For those going into this flick expecting simple fun, prepare to enjoy but prepare to be surprised. Fun is not the only piece of this pie. In fact, I think movie fans of all kind will be stunned at how many levels this movie delivers upon. This is an action packed but surprisingly deep film that, for me, really delivers. The Wolverine will leave your movie-going senses on high and I honestly can't wait to see it again.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining with some great action scenes but far from perfect,"Decent enough movie although far from perfect showcasing (an often) shirtless Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine in an X-Men spin off. This opens with Logan living as an Alaskan bush man (bearded, drinking lots, camping in the open woods) as he's still mourning the death of Jean Grey. He then travels to Japan to visit a dying old friend and learns that there's a way he can remove his immortality, but soon gets caught up in a conspiracy involving his friends devious family and the Yakuza.This was a bit all over the place as parts of it were very good and others were long, drawn out (even a bit dull at times) It is filled with some great action scenes though (the train sequence was cool, the funeral/Yakuza kidnapping, the final battle with the Samari 'Real Steel' robot -exciting) and Hugh Jackman looks amazing, wow he must have spent some hours in the gym.I liked the flashback sequences to WWll in Nagasaki. I didn't really understand the propose of the Jean Grey dream (fantasies?) especially when Logan is sleeping with other women. I liked that this took place almost exclusively in Japan -refreshing. There were some things that didn't make sense (like Logan's claws) and just assorted other plot holes I chose to ignore. The motivation from the bad guys was also a bit vague but whatever.As a whole, an entertaining movie though, make sure to watch past the closing credits for a bonus scene. 9/19/15",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Logan finally gets a stand-alone film to do him justice,"Logan's latest adventure is undeniably a step-up from X-Men Origins: Wolverine but it falls short of the standard set by X-Men: First Class.It was great to see Logan out of his usual environment, and it was a fresh location for superhero films in general from their usual US base but for the most part, especially the action scenes, they could have been anywhere. The Japanese location felt underutilised in setting this film apart from others in its genre. The action scenes are good, even if they do raise a few continuity questions, and the last third of the film is certainly filled with action, twists and turns. James Mangold managed to succeed where Origins did not, he managed to introduce a whole cast of characters but they generally all felt developed and not just crammed in for the sake of it.The film's biggest disappointment though was that it felt like it slipped back into the comfort of it's western formula, taking it from achieving the potential the story had, especially when Darren Aronofsky was attached to direct. The source material presented an opportunity for Logan's darkest and edgiest movie yet, but what we gets feels familiar but in a new location. Where it does set itself apart from previous entries with its dream sequences, which vary from good to distracting, but at least they tried something new.Make sure you don't leave the cinema when the credits hit though, if you've not learnt the Marvel formula yet then you might want to consider doing so.Overall, The Wolverine is a fun film but one that falls short of its potential. Hugh Jackman is still a perfect fit for Logan, and it was a nice change to see the character in a new environment and in his own story (Origins was not really a solo outing).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Character-focused 'The Wolverine' gives Wolvie the story he needed, not the dazzling blockbuster","Throughout the course of the modern superhero era, one thing has stayed true: Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. After being a successful piece of the ""X-Men"" franchise for three films, Wolverine got his own solo gig in 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"" which turned out to be a chaotic smear of superhero film with a cliché-ridden script. Jackman, who has become synonymous with the part in a way that would make even Robert Downey Jr. jealous, deserved better.Thankfully, ""The Wolverine"" is better. In fact, it bounces back from the very worst failings of ""Origins,"" telling a character-oriented story that borrows from the Chris Claremont-Frank Miller comic featuring Wolverine's Japanese saga.The story takes place post-""X-Men: The Last Stand,"" as Logan is haunted in his dreams by Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), whom he killed in that film in order to essentially save the world. Hiding out and looking like an imprisoned Jean Valjean somewhere in Alaska (he tends to do that), a Japanese woman named Yukio (Rila Fukushima) finds him and convinces him to travel back with her to Japan to meet her master, Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), whom Wolverine saved during the bombing of Nagasaki in World War II. Yashida is one of Japan's wealthiest men, a technology entrepreneur, and he wants to offer Wolverine the one thing he's never had – mortality. For someone who feels as though their gift has been a curse lately, it's an appealing offer.Of course there has to be a catch, and Wolverine soon finds himself dealing with the venomous Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and going on the run and protecting Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto), who is being sought after by the Yakuza (Japanese mob).The film almost never leaves Wolverine's side, and provides more than adequate motivational fuel for us to become invested in the story. Wolverine's consideration of his own inner pain and immortality finally gives Jackman something to work with, despite how good he is with all the more exterior elements of the character.Director James Mangold (""Walk the Line"" and the underrated remake of ""3:10 to Yuma"") excels at finding these character moments, while also taking the opportunity to make a Marvel samurai movie. The film's fight sequences take a visceral yet artistic approach reminiscent of a samurai film: violent, but stylized. An R-rated version, however, would've made this an exceptional film, but such is Hollywood.In summer after summer of large-scale blockbusters with immense action sequences, ""The Wolverine"" will be a tad underwhelming for anyone impartial to the character that is just looking for the ""next big movie."" Again, this movie is as much about Wolverine's internal struggle as what's happening on screen. It is exciting in small ways, not in big ways (outside of a sequence on top a bullet train). Mangold also does some cool things with a chase sequence through Tokyo in which the archer Harada (Will Yun Lee) snipes Yakuza thugs as Wolverine runs with Mariko.A lot of props go to the script team of Mark Bomback (""Unstoppable,"" ""Total Recall"") and Scott Frank (""Minority Report""), who revised the initial draft by Oscar winner Christopher McQuarrie (""The Usual Suspects""). Obviously the character element of the story works well, but the pacing is strong and surprises wait at every turn, even if the plot trajectory follows a pretty traditional superhero movie structure.To put ""The Wolverine"" in the context of the ever-growing rolodex of superhero movies, it's a rock-solid, entertaining, better-than-most entry, but years from now, will probably get overlooked among the genre's best thanks to the visually ground-breaking event films now and soon to be even more prevalent. It does little to stand out, but the Wolverine character didn't need something to make him stand out; it needed something more personal. Why else would you isolate a character from the X-Men if not to tell his personal story? ""The Wolverine"" is a superb film that should've come out four years ago, when it would've been a great film. If it were an origin story and not the fifth time Jackman put the claws on (not counting his ""X-Men: First Class"" cameo), I would put it on par with ""Iron Man"" minus some of the flashy CGI and a decent percentage of humor. There's no question Wolverine's lack of novelty will play a factor for those who find it unimpressive, but getting down to what it means to make a good superhero film, you can't go wrong with the model used in ""The Wolverine."" And fans will genuinely be excited about what Wolverine does next, with or without the X-Men.~Steven C Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com for more",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best Wolverine to date,Saw The Wolverine. Masterfully choreographed action and best train fight scene ever. The best Wolverine yet and Hugh Jackman delivers. Thoughtfully paced with a perfect blend of action and story. You don't need to know anything about the previous movies since this one can stand alone. The story may get in the way at times for those who only enjoy mindless action. I will go see it again without the 3D effect to see if that made any difference. The only drawback for me was the glare from theater stair's runner lights on my 3D glasses but that had nothing to do with the movie.

A Solitary Hero's Journey,"*The Wolverine* offers a refreshing departure from the typical superhero fare. It's a character study wrapped in a visually stunning action film. Hugh Jackman delivers a career-defining performance as a solitary and haunted Logan, stripped of his signature abilities.Set in a contemporary Japan, the film boasts a striking visual aesthetic that complements the story's introspective tone. The action sequences, particularly the bullet train fight, are adrenaline-pumping and meticulously choreographed. However, the film truly shines in its quieter moments, exploring Wolverine's internal struggles and his complex relationship with mortality.The supporting cast, including Rinko Kikuchi and Hiroyuki Sanada, add depth to the narrative. The film's exploration of Japanese culture and mythology is respectful and adds a unique flavor to the story.While *The Wolverine* is a standalone film that doesn't heavily rely on the X-Men universe, it does lay the groundwork for future storylines.

It had potential,"The Wolverine brings a lot of interesting new concepts and ideas to the world of X-men and the character of Wolverine, but rarely capitalizes on them, instead devolving into an incredibly generic popcorn flick that can't decide what it wants to be.

It's an improvement on X-Men Origins: Wolverine but it could still be better,"X-Men Origins: Wolverine was such a horrible movie that I was a bit suspicious going into this. Now, luckily it's a lot better than that in that it's actually watchable and I enjoyed it at times. I watched it in 2D (I hate 3D) so I can't say whether the 3D effects were done well or not.Hugh Jackman is most definitely the Wolverine. He nails the role and he's really never at fault with these movies. The problems are in other areas of the movie. Rila Fukushima does a pretty good job as Yukio for a first performance. Other performances weren't anything special but not bad either.There were some quite funny bits in the movie. Loved the hotel part especially and the bar scene in the beginning. Wolverine's grumpiness worked really well in these scenes. Japan was a cool setting for the movie and offered some good possibilities for misunderstandings and so on. The bullet train action scene was also quite intense. It was maybe the highlight of the movie which was surprising as it looked a bit goofy in the trailer.The pacing of the movie was a bit off as I was wondering a couple of times about how much there was still to go in the movie. Cinematography was so-so. There was some really annoying shaky cam in the action sequences that almost made me ill. Look to the Bourne movies if you want a model on how to use shaky cam in your movie. The use of shaky cam was especially puzzling because Wolverine was fighting ninjas a lot of the time. Why wouldn't you want us to have a clearer look of that? Shouldn't it be nicely choreographed and so on?The theme of the movie was immortality and how you can have meaning despite of that. I think it's an interesting theme and I hoped they would've explored that a bit more. Then again this movie was PG-13 so maybe they couldn't do that because they didn't want to alienate the younger viewers. You could really see that they tried to keep the age rating as low as possible in the amount of blood that's in the movie. Never have so many died with so little blood being spilled. A bit of an exaggeration maybe but you get the point.The plot was only serviceable but the movie really focused more on the characters anyway. The whole world isn't at stake here and the movie takes a more intimate approach. Wolverine's arc during the movie was quite interesting as he tried to deal with his past and find new meaning for his life. The ending was a bit too cartoonish and predictable for my taste. It also deviated too much from the tone of the rest of the movie.The Wolverine is definitely in the right direction but there's still much that could be improved. The movie needs more focus and it needs to do a better job at creating an emotional connection with the characters. A higher than PG-13 rating would also be nice to see to really allow for a more interesting movie. Still, I wouldn't say I wasted two hours watching this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Quite good superhero fare, but never great","THE WOLVERINE is a second spin off from the X-MEN franchise centred around Hugh Jackman's titular character. The first, X-MEN ORIGINS: WOLVERINE was a distinctly average viewing experience, although this one's a little better. It's not the stuff of greatness, but it has novelty value which makes it more entertaining than others I've seen.The story in a nutshell is Wolverine in Japan. The good news is that this allows a cast of Japanese supporting actors to shine, although most of them have very thin characters that seem based on cliché rather than experience. There's the damsel-in-distress, the evil black sheep family member, the old man obsessed with immortality. However, I was delighted to see Hiroyuki Sanada in a Hollywood film again (even though he's once more given a one-dimensional role, just like in RUSH HOUR 3) and surprised to notice Hal Yamanouchi (star of ENDGAME and a dozen other trashy Italian sci-fi flicks of the 1980s) in a pivotal role.The film's execution is fine, although the story is never quite as thrilling or expertly-made as I'd been led to believe. It's Jackman and his love interest against various competing bad guys. Jackman is bulked up but his acting is on autopilot. There's a ton of bloodless action scenes, and they do feel a little grittier than in the usual superhero outing, although the train set-piece has the same about of cheesy CGI as in the Thai flick VENGEANCE OF AN ASSASSIN. THE WOLVERINE does the job, and if you're a huge X-Men fan you might like it more. Me, I lightly enjoyed it, but it's not something I'd be in a hurry to watch again.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wolverine's True Comeback,"Wolverine is finally back, and this new installment in the ""X-Men"" franchise is extremely slick, exhilarating, and top-notch. Forget the disappointing ""Origins"" 4 years ago, this is the real Wolverine movie. It's action-packed, dark, occasionally humorous, and surprisingly has depth. It may not be the best ""X-Men"" film but ""The Wolverine"" is a solid entry that will help the ""X-Men"" franchise recover from the disappointing ""Last Stand"" and ""Origins"".In this installment, Wolverine is struggling with his immortality. His lover, Jean Grey died way back in ""The Last Stand"" and he's been suffering from an endless period of nightmares. It feels as if he has nothing to do on this Earth and he's longing to re-join his lover in the other side. But when an old acquaintance Yashida (a man who Wolverine saved during the 1945 bombing of Nagasaki) invites him to Japan and offers to remove his immortality, Wolverine is delved into new territory.There are two women who work alongside Wolverine here. First, there's Mariko Yashida, the granddaughter of Yashida and the chosen heiress to the throne. When she takes her grandfather's role, she will become the most powerful person in Japan and will need protection from the endless hordes of the Yakuza. The other person is the pink-haired Yukio who is an excellent fighter and form a great team with Wolverine.""The Wolverine"" is set in an environment new to the ""X-Men"" franchise, Japan. The vibrant colors, tall buildings, beautiful scenery are used in a maximizing manner. The action scenes look really well in this new setting.What made ""The Wolverine"" more engaging was that we finally get to see Logan mortal. He literally will get hurt if he gets shot or cut. For the first time ever, he is no longer invincible and this escalates the tension every time he's in a fight against an adversary. We see Wolverine lingering in the boundary between life and death. Wounded.Then we have the action sequences which are extremely intense. The climax was gripping but I also expressed extreme fondness for the action scene where Wolverine battled against several Yakuza members on top of a lightning-fast moving bullet train. That scene was extremely suspenseful and was one of the highlights, at least for me. Don't get me wrong, the other action sequences were fun too but that bullet train scene was just amazing.Hugh Jackman returns once again as the ageless Logan aka Wolverine. As usual, his performance is strong, gritty, and excellent. The only difference between his performance here and ""Origins"" is that his performance here is not burdened by an awful script as it was in ""Origins"". The other performances were powerful too. Tao Okamoto was perfect as the heiress Mariko Yashida and Rila Fukushima was bad-ass as Yukio. Everyone of the cast was good.All in all, ""The Wolverine"" is solid, action-packed and a satisfying addition to the ""X-Men"" franchise. It has incredible action scenes, solid acting, and a great script. However, I did find something nit-picking (no spoilers here but it concerns Logan's ability to recall a certain memory). Nonetheless, ""The Wolverine"" is successfully in continuing the revival of the ""X-Men"" franchise and only gets me more hyped about next year's ""Days of Future Past"". And watch out for the post-credits scene in the end.Rating: 8/10Final Verdict: Forget ""Origins"", ""The Wolverine"" is a terrific new entry in the ""X-Men"" franchise that serves as the Wolverine movie we all wanted.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine - a more deep side of Logan(much better than the last one),"The Wolverine - a more deep side of Logan(much better than the last one)So this was actually the sequel to X-Men: The Last Stand which continued the story of Logan in Japan.. This one was much better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine as there was much of script and soul about Logan than just an action flick. There were not much of 3D scenes but the action sequences were clean and natural and fast paced..specially the ""BULLET TRAIN"" sequence was mind blowing..........well acc. to me this movie was just as lovable as all other X-Men movies.Although there was too much Japanese, other than that it was a great film.

Could have been better,"I'm not really good with reviews so I'll just share my thoughts.I loved the way the movie started and that was about it. Die hard Wolverine fans will probably like it more, but I think X-men movies are much more interesting. Hugh Jackman plays the role great and I can't imagine another actor replacing him. The fight scenes were also very entertaining and well choreographed, but there was something missing (more mutants?) and I don't know what. There were a bit too much cliché's both plot and character - wise too.That said - I would gladly watch another Wolverine movie and hope it turns out better than this one. I would recommend the movie, but don't expect ""A man of steel"" awesome effects and dramatic storyline. Just grab some popcorn and enjoy, BUB!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rent it,"I saw this on a whim and wasn't really looking forward to it, if anything I thought it be terrible, that being said thought it was much better than the Origins movie that came out a while back. The opening doesn't even feel like a big budget blockbuster flick, it's slow paced, well shot; it's a very different feel from the usual approach with these movies.Now I don't mean to say that it's a boring, drawn out, art house flick, but there is a level of care put to detail in this movie that goes over looked in most superhero summer movies at the expense of fast paced action and high stakes.Then right around the last act of the movie it takes a sharp left turn to the outlandlishly absurd. It really feels like two different movies, and I might even entertain the idea that the studio execs were responsible for that, seems like they got their dirty hands on it from that point on. The Silver Samurai scene is every bit as ridiculous as you'd expect it be, and the finale is totally anticlimactic.I wouldn't pay top dollar for it but I'd definitely watch it on a slow evening when the only thing on TV is a Lifetime movie. I wonder what Darren Aronofsky would've done with it had he not left it to work on Noah.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dares to go small... and loses,"Epic scale, wide scope and large scale destruction have become par for the course in the genre of big budget Summer comic book movies, with each new film seemingly trying to top the previous one. But this Summer we've seen two of these so-called popcorn movies take a very non-traditional approach to blockbuster entertainment.The first was 'Iron Man 3'. Yes the final act had its share of 'Things go boom!' carnage, but for most of its running time it was a smaller and more personal story than its predecessors (It also wasn't very good). And now we can add 'The Wolverine', another character-centric comic book movie where its not the entire world in the balance, but instead one man's world. That man—or mutant—is Logan, AKA Wolverine. Hugh Jackman returns to the role for the sixth time (if you count his memorable cameo in 'X-Men: First Class'), and he's in fine form. By now he has this character down cold, and his barely contained rage and intensity help to carry this film just above the slog that it otherwise is.It's beautifully shot and often very thoughtful, but neither the action nor the half-baked story are propulsive enough to make us care. The Wolverine is yet another dud in the ""Summer of disappointment"".",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Expectations went downhill with not so engaging movie. Hugh Jackman was the only saving grace,"Starting with X-men series ( directed by Bryan Singer) , Wolverine is the sixth outing featuring Hugh Jackman which has certain improvement over others in terms of story and performance but falls flat with not-so convincing plot, action sequences , CGI and screenplay.Running away from the world , Logan ( played by Hugh Jackman) , leads a nomadic wild life until he is found by red-head Yukio who leads Logan to Yashida. Yashida must re-pay his debts ( he was saved by Logan during nuclear attack in World War 2) by trading Logan for the immortality he is craving for and giving death opportunity which Logan wants.From the director of 3:10 to Yuma, Identity and Walk the Line , James Mangold disappoints this time. One would expect Wolverine to excel more than its predecessor with a superhero touch but not just the story , even highly anticipated movie gives a thumbs down to tamed CGI and not-s- engaging action scenes which is an integral part of a superhero movie but just turns into a bland love story. The movie running time is 126 mins and there is not a single scene which would be remembered after leaving the theater. Background score is ineffective. Editing is loose. Cinematography is just about OK. Screenplay is uninteresting. The only silver lining is power packed performance by Hugh Jackman who gets into character of Wolverine with well-chiseled physique and emotes extensively with appropriate scenes.Overall , I did not like Wolverine and my expectation went downhill with not so engaging movie. Give it a miss. Average 2.5/5",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Jackman is forceful and charismatic, only if he had something more interesting to do here.","Choosing the artful director James Mangold ""Walk the Line"" (2005) and ""Knight and Day"" (2010), certainly enjoys a much smoother journey to the big screen than its predecessor, ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009). The movie adopts a new, visually appealing setting encouraging a change in tone for the heroic comic book character, with a script written by Scott Frank and Mark Bomback that contains themes of mortality, family, honor, and forgiveness. In ""The Wolverine,"" Mangold, Frank, and Bomback introduce new layers to the popular, charismatic mutant with a tortured soul who is making his sixth ""X-Men"" franchise appearance.It's a character driven plot that takes the Wolverine into new territory, both figuratively and literally. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is a wolf without a pack, in a self- imposed exile after the ruinous losses of 2006's ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" The movie takes place mostly in modern-day Japan, where Logan reconnects with a former soldier he shielded from the atom bomb dropped on Nagasaki in 1945.Decades later, the immortal mutant is summoned to the side of the man he saved by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), an electric redhead with superior knife skills, and an ability to foresee the future. The dying Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), now a billionaire, offers his savior the chance to lose his immortality, and to live a normal life span without his super-healing powers and incredible strength. Logan finds himself mixed up in the succession between Yashida and the Japanese mob, the Yakuza. The Yakuza is trying to assassinate his beautiful granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto), and Logan chases her down cross-country to protect her from harm.Drawing on the influence of Samurai films, the action is refreshingly tactile, with well- choreographed fight scenes and some genuinely impressive blockbuster set-pieces. The high point of the movie is the Tokyo bullet train sequence around the halfway mark, which provides some sorely needed thrills -- something which the final showdown fails to provide entirely. The third act is overloaded with CGI driven combat scenes which feels overly artificial given its character driven storyline. By the end of the movie however, nothing has really changed, and Wolverine is more or less the same superhero from two hours earlier. This is Jackman's show entirely, and he is as forceful and charismatic as ever. If only he had something more interesting to do here.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awful,The worst of the series. Continual bs during the entire film. Terrible ending and plot,2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
not much entertainment value,"Some time after the events of The Last Stand, this sequel of sorts focuses on Logan/Wolverine as a tortured soul living in isolation and haunted by vivid memories of his lost love. Now, having reached an emotional impasse, he travels to Japan to visit an old comrade. Once there, he quickly gets caught up in a complex political power struggle that, for the first time in his life, makes him truly vulnerable. Jackman, not unexpectedly, is formidable in the lead, and there are lots of visceral action scenes, but that does little to compensate for the faults; film's tone is grim, its characters—sans Jackman—are unappealing, plotting is convoluted, subject matter turns ugly, and the pace lags heavily after a strong start. Jackman effectively spits, scowls, snarls, and flexes his muscles in what has become his go-to role, but he has almost no support; too long, too dark, and too serious to really be fun. **",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Quite enjoyable, better than Origins","The Wolverine is not as good as the first two X-Men films, which were very good and great respectively. But it does improve on Last Stand and Origins by quite a fair bit, neither are as bad as they're reputed to be but had a lot of glaring shortcomings. That is not to say that The Wolverine had no shortcomings either. There is some illogical scripting, the romance is a bit forced and the extended scenes that has it bogs the film down, the ending is a bit too rushed, some scenes dragged and were a touch repetitive and the Japanese characters were very under-written and not at all interesting. What The Wolverine does do that improves on Origins and Last Stand is that it isn't anywhere near as bad as trying to incorporate too many subplots and too many characters and then develop hardly any of them. The film looks great, the special effects improved over those from Origins, it's slickly edited, it's shot cohesively and it has a beautifully dark look that gives it both a grit and audaciousness. The music is suitably dynamic and while not completely action-enhancing it at least fits. The story is not perfect, but there was a dark intensity there, some unexpected twists and turns and I didn't have too much trouble following it, while the action is smartly handled especially the Throne of Blood-like ninja fight and the one on the superfast train. The funeral one was reasonably fun too but was over too quickly. James Mangold does valiantly and unlike Brett Ratner and Gavin Hood he is actually comfortable throughout instead of being good in one aspect(the action) and not in the other. The performances are fine, although Tao Okamoto's beauty is nowhere near enough to salvage her bland acting. Rila Yukushima's acrobatics dazzle and of the femme fatales Svetlana Khodchenkova is even better, slinky and formidable. But Hugh Jackman gives the best performance, a very powerful performance while being subdued, it was nice to see some depth to him this time when in Last Stand and Origins he was moody for the sake of it seemingly and not much else. The Japanese culture was very nicely done and gave the film some diversity. To conclude, a decent and quite enjoyable film that serves as a better but still not perfect origins story. 6.5/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Improvement over X-Men Origins: Wolverine,"During WWII, prisoner Logan (Hugh Jackman) saved the life of Yashida when the bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Now Yashida, on his deathbed, proposes to return the favor. Logan is haunted by the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) promising never to inflict violence. Yukio (Rila Fukushima) retrieves Logan from America. She's a great warrior with the ability to see people's future deaths. Yashida tells him that he could transfer his immortality to another. Then he's attacked by Dr. Green/Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova). Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is in danger and Logan steps in to save her.As often is the case with Wolverine, he starts off living in isolation. Going to Japan is a very interesting move for his character. His loner mentality is perfect there. I really like the first half. It has great action and some fitting humor. It also has good intrigue. The second half does take a break. I'm not impressed with Tao Okamoto's acting. She has one tone and her character lacks energy. On the other hand, I really like Rila Fukushima. She exudes energy and has more fun in her character. She's a good sidekick to Wolverine. The final battle do drag on a little too long. Overall, this has a good look, some good action, and a little bit of humor. Director James Mangold does a good job pulling it all together.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A return to form for The Wolverine,"Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's 1982 Japanese story arc is one of the most famous and celebrated in comic book history. It has finally been the cinematic treatment, amidst a loose adaptation and watches out the taste of Wolverine's first solo outing.After the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, Logan (Hugh Jackman) has living alone in the Canadian wilderness and suffering from recurring dreams about Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and guilt about her death. As Logan challenges a group of illegal hunters in a bar, he is found by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a woman recruited to bring The Wolverine to Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), a dying Japanese industrialist he saved when he was a Prisoner of War outside Nagasaki.In Japan, Yashida gives Logan an offer to take his healing factor and make Wolverine mortal. But even though Wolverine refuses his powers are taken from him anyway and he is thrown into a family industrial struggle involving the Yakuza, a clan of ninjas, a corrupt Japanese government minister and a mysterious biochemist mutant known as The Viper (Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova who performs with a flawless American accent). As Wolverine protects Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), from all these factions, he also begins to see what it can be like to live a normal life.X-Men Origins: Wolverine had many problems, misjudged humour, awful special effects, subpar action, awful writing and introducing characters just for the sake of fan service. The Wolverine does rectify many of these problems and director James Mangold had much more free reign then Gavin Hood had.Mangold knew what made the best X-Men films work, so he focuses on character development and more brooding drama and it is complemented by an excellent performance from Jackman. Jackman gives us the Wolverine of old, a character who is haunted, suffering from nightmares and guilt, looking for a reason to give his life meaning as well as giving us the gruff wit we know and love from Wolverine. The Wolverine is a much darker film, more akin to X-Men and X2 which it needed to be. Yet the film still has a massive injection of fun which you would expect from a film featuring mutants, samurais and ninjas.While The Wolverine has an expected PG-13 rating, Mangold does push it to the limit. We see Wolverine sliding his way through Yakuza thugs, having his flesh scorched off by the nuclear blast and our hero having to operate on himself. There is solid action throughout the film and the more cheesy elements has been removed in The Wolverine, with the only misjudged sequence being the Bullet Train fight sequence, as it comes off a little goofy. Comedy has also been cut, with The Wolverine having two overtly comic sequences and Wolverine having a few comic remarks, but they are actually inkeeping with the character.As an adaptation of the Japanese miniseries, The Wolverine had to take liberties to make it work with the film series' continuity (though continuity is now very screwed up in the X-Men series). Yukio is no longer the ambiguous assassin with a danger complex and her colour are nailed on the mast, Mariko and Logan having no prior relationship, Mariko's father (Hiroyuki Sanada) is a combination of her father and husband in the comic and the Viper has no role in the original comic are just some of the changes that were made. But these are changes that are easy to look past, even though on a personal standpoint it would have been nice to see more of the parallels between Wolverine and Yukio. The changes to the Silver Samurai will be a bit harder to swallow for comic book fans and it is when the film loses it way a little with its action climax.The Wolverine had a number of villains and it does result in problems. The first one is the film does not know who to make the main villain before settling on Viper, who does have a commanding presence on screen. The other is due to the number of factions in play, which makes many of the characters a bit underdeveloped. One character that suffered this was Will Yun Lee's Harada, the head of the ninja who did have an interesting character who was loyal to Mariko.The Wolverine does have some script problems and the final act is a more generic affair, but its clear that Mangold and Jackman do have a good understanding of the character and they put the cinematic version of Wolverine in good standing.And on a final note, the post credit scene is a must see: it is one of best and most tantalising in a long time.Please visit www.entertainmentfuse.com",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good not Great,"As the title says i thought this was good but not great. I didn't mind the fact the film felt a bit slow in parts, I didn't even mind that most of the action scenes were already shown in the trailers it's just i felt there was something missing from this.I felt the Viper was a bit weak and the way the ending came about with the Silver Samurai was a bit predictable. I will say i thought Yukio was excellent and Jackman as Wolverine was excellent as well. I understand why Jean Grey was in his dreams, To show the anguish and pain Logan goes through but i did think the film could have done without it.I love the whole Samurai thing, The Eastern culture fascinates me but i can't seem to put my finger on what stops this being anything above a 7/10 for me. It may be that i will enjoy it more on the second watch but there is still no doubt that it is better than Wolverine: Origins while possibly on a par with the best X-Men film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
vast improvement.,"A vast improvement over the crapfest X-Men Origins Wolverine the film pretty much ignores the fact that the film even really happened which is a good thing. Picking it up after the finale of X3 we find our title character loning it up when he is found by a bad ass Japanese woman in search of him because he saved her boss some fifty odd years ago. After some discussion he decides to say his goodbyes and discovers a conspiracy involving the Yakuza trying to assassinate his granddaughter who Wolvie takes a liking too. The film is a little underdeveloped but engaging enough to merit some solid entertainment. Tightly choreographed fight scenes and some strong female characters as well as Jackman's lovable character and trademark biceps and Abs enhance the films viewing pleasure. A downfall is the character of Viper and the actress who plays her who are pretty cheesetastic and seem out of place in the films more reality based setting. I also wish they had spent a bit more time developing the films core relationship. Still what stands is a fun, somewhat ferocious and much improved installment of Jackman's lovable take on the iconic character.Stay a little after the credits for anintriguing cliffhanger.

The best X-Men related film yet.,"I went into this movie with high expectations, and hoping to see the Wolverine unleash his fury on his enemies,and I was not disappointed. The action in this movie is unbelievable. Without giving too much away, I would say that the fighting in this movie was extremely well choreographed, and had some amazing weapon fights in it.Another thing that I have loved about this movie from the very beginning is that it is set in mostly modern Japan. To me Japan really is a beautiful country, that is rarely seen in comic book films, and made for very interesting fight scenes and theme to the story arc overall.The story was also well done in part as I mentioned before to the unique setting, as well as some of the characters like the mutant Reptile.It also plays around with the very core of Wolverine's mutant powers, and takes it in a very interesting direction that keeps fans on the edge of their seat throughout the movie.My only very minor disappointment was in a part of the ending which was slightly predictable. Besides that however this was easily one of the best movies to come out this year, and it is a must see for Wolverine, and X-Men fans alike.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Too long, unexciting.","Several people criticized the last Wolverine movie as simplistic and shallow. We were made to believe that the latest movie would strike the right balance between depth and adrenaline. Guess what, it has managed neither. In India there is a saying- ""Dhobi ka kutta na ghar ka na ghat ka"". It basically signifies that sorry state that results when you try to be two things at once and end up being neither. An identity confusion ensues. The moment this movie ended, the above saying just popped into my mind. There's a new wave sweeping in Hollywood. A fad has developed to try and make superheroes more 'real' with shades of grey. Christopher Nolan epitomizes this, rather successfully, with his Batman series. His Batman movies are dark, have depth, keep you thinking and have top notch action. Not that Batman series of movies has no flaws, it's just that he's somehow managed to strike a balance. Several other superhero movies- our latest Wolverine movie- for example, seem like pitiable caricatures, misdirected endeavors. The balance between psychological depth and adrenaline has been mismanaged. The depth seems contrived, and action- unconvincing and unexciting.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Jackman is The Wolverine,"Hugh Jackman is awesome in ""The Wolverine"". As hero Logan he commands the screen. He is absolutely shredded, and fights with fierce samurai skills. Jackman authentically explores Logan's despair in his immortal fate with the Director James Mangold's envisioning of Wolverine's search for purpose. Jackman is deftly droll as Logan, hiding a well of emotion. ""The Wolverine"" ebbs on the verge of great with resonant values of mortality, purpose, and honor.The movie opens with an amazing news reel-like sequence of Nagasaki in World War II. Logan selflessly saves his captor Japanese officer Yashida (young Ken Yamanouchi) from the atomic bomb explosion. In present day Logan (Jackman) returns to the site with Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (stunning and beautiful Tao Okamoto). She recalls her grandfather's stories. She tells Logan, ""Everything finds peace eventually."" This gets lost in the last 20 minutes of the movie when it implodes into standard action mayhem.The screenplay by Mark Bomback and Scott Frank is based on classic storyline by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller as Logan travels back to Japan. Though familiar, but not having read it, some of the appealing back story is displaced. ""The Wolverine"" misses the profound opportunity to show Logan become samurai. Battling vicious Yakuza at the Shinto ceremony is elegantly spectacular. The martial arts are exquisite. Hiroyuki Sanada (of ""The Last Samurai"") is world class. As Shingen his katana duel with the Wolverine is signature precision. Rila Fukushima as Logan's ""protector"" Yukio is so cool with thrusting staff and kicks.Jackman as Logan fights in deadly martial arts style. It is weird that Logan's samurai skills are not really explained, though he is rogue samurai—Ronin without master or purpose. He comments on Shingen's kendo mastery display, ""He's good."" A clue? Too bad samurai themes of mortality and fatalism are not more fleshed out. Jackman and Mangold hint with Logan's seeming restraint. Wolverine's ""beserker"" rage has element of focus. I was expecting ""The Last Samurai"" meets the Wolverine, but unfortunately not. The sword fight on top of the Bullet Train is breathtaking, and the Ninja archers in the snowy village are high drama. Given the tantalizing set up, we really don't get eloquent resolution of Mariko's deserved peace or the discovery of one's purpose in mortality .To that end we find Logan having nightmares about his beloved Jean Grey. Famke Jassen is beautiful and strangely haunting. Logan poignantly wishes for death. However, his regenerative powers make him virtually immortal. Since Jean's death, he lives alone in the icy woods of Alaska. About to exact revenge on reckless grizzly bear hunters, Logan is saved from himself by J-pop warrior Yukio (strong and spirited Rila Fukushima). She has been looking for him for over a year. Yashida is dying of cancer and would like to see Logan. Yashida (solid Harahiko Yamanouchi) is now the richest man in the World. He offers to repay Logan with is mortality—""Eternity can be a curse."" Logan says. ""You don't want what I got."" Logan becomes immersed in the Family drama. Shingen (Sanada) and his daughter Mariko clash over who will be heir to the Yashida Empire. Mariko is in a beneficial, but loveless engagement to Noburo (good snakelike Brian Tee). Mariko has a protector in Harada (brave Will Yun Lee), former lover. The mysterious Viper (enigmatic and evil Svetlana Khodchenkova) may have secretly weakened Logan.Twists ensue and Logan becomes Mariko's savior and defender. I actually think their love story is inspired. Jackman and Okamoto have a touching chemistry. Again like much of narrative, we miss a gratifying payoff. ""The Wolverine"" is an awesome action movie, and Mangold generates beauty with Japanese locals and distinct culture. Through all this Hugh Jackman commands ""The Wolverine"" and makes it worth watching. Jackman is powerful. He genuinely enrolls us in Logan's vulnerability tempered with his great courage. He is amazing. He makes us pull for the poetic samurai conclusion. ""The Wolverine"" and Hugh Jackman are amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Slightly disappointed,"This film is set following the events of The Last Stand and it shows Wolverine attempting to deal with the aftermath. In the beginning he is almost unrecognisable and he has distanced himself from his former life. However this is Wolverine and he could never stay away from trouble so it's not too long before the action starts kicking in.Certain aspects of the story line felt rushed and though it wasn't hard to follow, it didn't seem like enough thought had been put in. In particular I found the love interest extremely forced and unnecessary especially because so much of the story evolved around it. However I still enjoyed this film and there were plenty of brilliant action scenes as should be expected when the main character is Wolverine. Despite the questionable story line this film is still definitely worth a watch, for Hugh Jackman's continued brilliant portrayal of Wolverine if nothing else.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Hugh Jackman and Tao Okamoto were awesome,...but the movie was boring","Exploring a more mature subject matter in Logan's existential crisis, is great in theory. In reality though, it requiered an insane amount of boring exposition to connect a huge bunch of characters and their stories, only so they could justifiy a bunch of explosive action sequences, almost like if the genre of the movie dictated them more than the history itself.And because of all that work, the movie felt disjointed and forced, with a bunch of ultimately really superfluous characters talking way too minutes on screen, and really bad villains that took away plenty of the potential excitment in the third act.It wasn't a waste of time, and the story when you think about it is good, but the execution was lackluster and boring.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great entertainment, made for adults","This is not another light and fluffy comic book super hero movie. This movie actually has depth and substance to it, and there are not fight scenes taking place every few minutes like in most comic book movies lately. It is more of a deep character study of the Wolverine. I thought it was unexpectedly good, with Jackman doing a superb job in the lead role, as a tortured hero, who seems as if he no longer wants to go on living his near immortal existence because of deep regrets and guilt he is feeling about things that happened in the past.But it is not all doom and gloom, there are indeed fight scenes, and they are what you would expect of a summer blockbuster type movie. The last fight scene involving a giant robot-like Samurai is especially spectacular. Just don't expect the fight scenes to be the main focus of the movie, this is more about the Wolverine and his inner struggles of conscience. I liked it very much.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An Improvement so Average,"With the X-Men seemingly disbanded and living in isolation, The Wolverine picks up a few years after the events of The Last Stand with Logan living in the woods dealing with the grief that still haunts him. However, when someone from his past calls upon Logan to say his farewell, our hero finds himself in Japan and involved in a tumultuous family drama. Directed by James Mangold and starring Hugh Jackman once again as the titular character, The Wolverine was released during the summer of 2013 to moderate success.It goes without saying at this point but The Wolverine is a vast improvement of Origins, displaying genuine heart and emotion for the character that really allows the audience to get invested. The Wolverine has a very solid opening and sets a different tone than what we have seen in any of the other films apart of the X-Men series. It's a little more mature and violent, and while The Wolverine offers a version of Logan that is darker, fans would still have to wait a few more years to see the true version of the character, although it is certainly a step in the right direction.The choice to set the movie in Japan was interesting, I understand it is a storyline in the comics but to translate it to film was an intriguing decision that I believe worked. Part of the reason it worked so well is the filmmakers used the setting to their advantage creating really wonderful shots that feel ripped straight from a comic panel - at points, The Wolverine felt like the best looking film in the X-Men franchise so far. Likewise, this is probably the best Hugh Jackman had been as Wolverine/Logan up to that point, his performance is riveting and the film does a good job capturing the grief the character has for decisions he has made in his life and the people he has lost.Now where the film has its faults is within its story and pacing; as I mentioned The Wolverine has an excellent introduction but in its second and third act it can feel like a drag and gets pretty ridiculous. I found Yashida's desire to take Logan's power to be an interesting premise and the assassination plot-line was also pretty fun - it features this fight scene on a bullet train that is a huge standout. Other than though The Wolverine sort of falls in line with any other superhero film, while the second act can drag a little, the climax and final battle of the film was a tad cartoony given the tone set by the film earlier. I realize this may have been a plot-line that has been featured in the comics, I just don't know how well it worked for a movie - it felt a little ridiculous at points.The Wolverine still remains a step in the right for the character and franchise as a whole when it was released in 2013 and although the movie had its moments I don't know if it will be something I revisit. Hugh Jackman and the cinematography are clear standouts but given what we got in 2018 with Logan and the film falling into the trap of other superhero movies I think it is vastly inferior to the true standouts within the X-Men franchise. The Wolverine is the perfect film to flip on during a Saturday afternoon, it has its moment and it can certainly be an enjoyable film however it doesn't do enough interesting things to set itself apart, outside of finally telling a darker Logan tale. While I do appreciate some factors about the film, it is one that is perfectly average and for that reason, I am giving The Wolverine a 5.5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Clawing up Japan...,"The refreshing part about ""The Wolverine"" was that it was lacking all the superheroes and their powers, which was a nice turn of events, as I personally am not overly much a fan of the whole superhero genre.Storywise, then there were some interesting aspects to the movie, but there were moments that lingered and took a rather long time to get anywhere.It should be said that the acting in the movie was quite good, and Hugh Jackman does really portray the Wolverine character quite nicely and he does bring a lot to the character. Svetlana Khodchenkova was also an interesting choice for playing Viper. And while we are on the Viper character, then that was an interesting character, and it was a shame that she wasn't really given more on-screen time.Effects-wise then ""The Wolverine"" does it quite nice. It uses enough effects and CGI to keep the movie fresh and interesting, without overdoing it and turning it into a CGI special effects galore and putting the actual story in the background.Whereas the previous movies set in the X-Men universe have been rather stereotypical in terms of superhero movies go, then ""The Wolverine"" takes a turn for a more mature approach and appeals to an audience that are actually well out of their teenage years.""The Wolverine"" provides good entertainment, regardless of whether or not you are familiar with the main character.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Simple but good,"I like the fact that this movie feels like an anthology story, separated from the X-Men canon to show a standalone story with its own ups and downs.The film manages to eschew superhero clichés to some extent, staying for the most part in its first two acts as a pure action film, though finally falling into its rightful niche in the last act.Regarding the characters, Viper is a cartoonish villain who feels unnecessary and out of place in the story. If we took her out of the movie, we would have a better final product.Despite having flaws, it has good decisions in the direction. Also, it shows that there is a good budget behind it, because many technical aspects are of good quality.I don't know how faithful the movie is to the comics, but I was quite entertained.

Wolverine: A revival note for the franchise...,"James Mangold, director of 3:10 to Yuma, presented wolverine as a revival for the long dead x-men franchise. After the devastating display in X-men: Last stand, which was crucified by both fans and critics, for it's blind treatment that even killed it's principle characters, X-men series was struggling to hold on the screen. Two prequels were released, one as an origin story for wolverine and the other depicted the revelry between professor x and magneto. The new wolverine works as a sequel to x3, and tries to lead a path for the series in future. Taking place in Japan, Wolverine deals with the inner struggle of Logan, who grieves about the death of Jean Grey. He questions his eternity as a curse, and wanders around alone. A man, who Logan saved before a long time ago offers him a cure, which will make him mortal. Logan's decisions, and subsequent incidents makes the movie. Hugh Jackman, as usual with his signature role, shines. Supporting cast, including Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima and Will Yun Lee, does justice to their roles. Mangold, with his character-oriented approach, helped the movie to fall out from comic treatment. What lacks in Wolverine is it's explosive nature. The movie emphasize only on Logan. His grieve and his attempts to overcome it. No other characters, except Viper, is mutant here. That made the movie to look like a unique one in the franchise. Also, Wolverine leaves a number of loose ends, like what happened to the other mutants like Storm and Colossus. Let's see next year's X-men days future past answers them all.....",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An outstanding introduction to a larger universe that does the character justice,"The Wolverine is the SECOND solo installment for the character and the SIXTH X-Men installment from Fox. The story itself is definitely an improvement to it's predecessors (Except First Class) and teases a larger universe Fox is preparing in order to compete with Marvel Studios.From a filmmaker's perspective, the movie's cinematography was okay. The funeral scene could have been much better in terms of directing and blocking. The acting was impressive but felt a little cheesy in some parts. Hugh Jackman rocks this role and I have to give Rila Fukushima props considering this is her performance in a feature film. Bravo.The twist was predictable towards the beginning but James Magnold has done a great job distracting the audience from it....only for a while.The movie is filled with beautiful Japanese culture and scenery.

Felt more like a nice little additional Wolverine TV movie,"My first impression was, that it is mostly not worthy for Hugh Jackman and Wolverine.The change of scenery is quite pleasing, also the plot and Logan's situation add up with the happenings after 'The Last Stand'.But it felt more like a little additional TV movie of Wolverine and if I would've seen it in 2013 in a cinema, I would've been pissed since it doesn't feel like it's reached the standard of what's possible.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A Fresh, Self-Contained Superhero Movie That Falls Down in the Last Third","While not without its flaws, The Wolverine is a vast improvement over 2009's abysmal X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Right from the opening sequence, which takes place in Hiroshima during the dropping of the atomic bomb, the upgrade in quality is so noticeable, from the cinematography to the editing, to the special effects. A lot of credit must go to director James Mangold, who does a great job with the material.After an opening scene in Japan during World War II, The Wolverine takes place in the present day. Following the death of Jean Grey, Logan has been living alone in the wilderness, haunted by the past. When an old friend reaches out to him, Logan travels to Japan, where he is offered mortality. From here, he gets embroiled in a conspiracy involving Yakuza and mutants.Tens years after its release, most comic book superhero movies spend much of their runtime setting up potential sequels, team-ups and spin-offs. What's so refreshing about this film is that besides an unnecessary after-credits scene, this movie is almost entirely self-contained. While Logan is haunted by events that have happened in X-Men: The Last Stand, this certainly isn't a follow-up to that story. It is a film focused on Wolverine, with a new setting and a new cast of characters.The Japanese setting adds a freshness to affairs, often lacking in comic book movies. It utilises this setting brilliantly, incorporating iconic Japanese elements such as Yakuza, Bullet Trains, Samurai and Ninjas.The film moves at a steady pace, taking its time to tell the story, focused more on character than simply the individual action sequences, although there is plenty of action too. The standout sequence involves Logan fighting a bunch of Yakuza thugs on top of a bullet train. The set piece is silly but quite fun and inventive.The film falls down in its third act, however, in which the plot becomes much more generic than it had been up to this point. It features Logan fighting a giant CGI robot. Up until this point, the action felt much more visceral and grounded. It also suffers in its tone, particularly with Svetlana Khodchenkova, who plays Viper. Compared to the quite serious, sombre mood of the film. Her character and performance feel so out of place. It would have worked much better in one of the earlier X-Men films, but not here.I think the film would have benefitted from an R-Rating. While it does push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating, it still feels slightly constrained. The extended edition adds more swearing and violence, and this version feels more in line with the tone Mangold and Jackman were going for. Both Mangold and Jackson would follow up this film with the R-Rated Logan, which I feel is the type of film they were going for here but couldn't make due to creative constraints.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great reaction to the aftermath,"Set after ""X-Men: The Last Stand"", the movie follows Logan struggling to cope with the aftermath of that movie's final events. It features great action, a new setting to be explored in this world and a compelling story keeping it all together.Performances all around were really good, with no surprise from Hugh Jackman and a pleasing experience with the new characters in the broadening of the 'X-Men' universe, with a personal highlight being Yukio. The Japan setting was a cool new direction able to make the story feel more fresh. Furthermore, the action was great, with some amazing close-combat fight choreography.On the other hand, the character Viper tonally felt like she belonged in an earlier X-Men movie, coming off as a bit too comic accurate in an otherwise relatively grounded film, with the same going for the main villain introduced near the end of the film. The romance felt a bit suddenly forced and although it was kind of built up, it didn't feel entirely necessary. The scene at the end of the credits felt like it was taking a hit for the team with revealing something seemingly impossible just so 'Days Of Future Past' wouldn't have to explain it, making that movie a little bit more understandable.Overall, this film was a compelling superhero movie with great action and performances. For fans of the X-Men franchise and more specifically the character of Logan, The Wolverine is entertaining as much as it is captivating.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine,"This second solo outing for the eponymous ""X-Man"" sees him rescue a Japanese soldier from the Nagasaki bomb. Many years later, that solider - ""Yashida"" (Hal Yamanouchi) - has become a wealthy and successful industrialist determined to leave his fortune to his strong-willed and capable granddaughter ""Mariko"" (Tao Okamoto). It's soon clear, though, that that succession plan is going to face it's problems - not least from her own father ""Shingen"" (Hiroyuki Sabada) and the Yakuza replete with their own group of combat-ready mutants. When an attempt is made to kidnap the woman at the old man's funeral, ""Logan"" (Hugh Jackman) gets more than he bargained for - and is now faced with a dilemma the like of which he had hitherto thought impossible. Moreover, this development actually puts both him and his charge at considerable risk. The plot takes a further twist when they both discover that there may yet be an even more dangerous foe awaiting them. Though this looks good, the story is weak and the characterisations all largely undercooked as the emotional undercurrents for ""Logan"" - still reeling from his loss of ""Jean Grey"" - drags the story into a mire of sentiment that makes this actually quite heavy going at times. As with the ""Origins"" film (2009) the nature of his battle skills require much too much close quarter and repetitive combat scenes that, after a while - and after he has, for the umpteenth time, emerged from a battle against overwhelming odds without breaking a nail - become jaded and dull to watch. The denouement scenes here seem to go on interminably, but without any sense of jeopardy - we all know what is going to happen and no amount of acrobatics and pyrotechnics makes that inevitability any more exciting to watch. Jackman himself is nowhere near his best here, either - it is almost as if he is as tired of this role as I am now. The supporting cast do little more than make up the numbers and though it's watchable enough, I did struggle and seriously hope we will see no more of these en-seul efforts.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
As Solid As Adamantium Claws,"It has been some time since the events of X-Men: The Last Stand. Logan (Hugh Jackman), the honorable yet brutal warrior of the mutant super team, has grown disenchanted with life and is living in the wilderness of Canada. Haunted by memories of his lost love Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), the loner is a victim of his own immortality. He has all the time in the world, but nothing left to live for.That is until Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a messenger from a man he once saved many years before named Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi) , tracks him down with a luring proposition. Yashida , now a technology mogul, is nearing the end of his life. He claims that before he passes, he wishes to grant Logan the gift of mortality in exchange for saving his life so many years ago.Of course, everything is not as it seems. And it is not long before Logan is caught up in family politics involving Yashida's heirs: fiery son Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada) and captivating granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamato). After Yakuza goons make an attempt to kidnap Mariko, Logan rescues her and finds new purpose in keeping her protected. As they camp out in hiding, the two fall for each other and he is able to find relief in confessing his past to her. But peace does not last for long as Mariko is eventually snatched away from him, leading the Wolverine to give chase and track her down by any means necessary.The thing that makes The Wolverine work on so many levels is its maturity. Christopher Nolan showed with his Batman trilogy that superhero movies could be loyal to the sometimes serious tone of comics but still be accessible to the masses. Movies based on Marvel characters for the most part have not followed suit. While entertaining, the Marvel movies (the Punishers being the exception) have been light hearted affairs that focus more on action and laughs than story or character development. Logan, however, is a serious character with grown up problems who deserves a script to reflect that. Director James Mangold and Jackman have a done a solid job in bringing that angst to the screen. The Frank Miller and Chris Claremont penned story arc that Mangold and his crew of writers have borrowed from for this movie is considered to be one of the best in Wolverine canon. In fact, the first two-thirds of The Wolverine are so good at developing the mutant's character, that viewers do not even notice the lack of constant action scenes that are so prevalent in superhero films today. It is a testament to Jackman's now effortless portrayal of the troubled protagonist and also to Mangold's ability to match the atmosphere of the dark content of early Wolverine comics.This is not to say that The Wolverine lacks explosiveness. There is just enough fighting and chases throughout those aforementioned first two-thirds, and a little too much of it in the final act. It is in the final act where Mangold slips a little, digressing back into a standard Marvel piece heavy on smoke and mirrors instead of genuine substance. But Marvel's smoke and mirrors still outdazzle most of its competition on any given movie night and audiences will not be let down here.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Japanese Neo-Noir character piece,"Unleashed Extended EditionA deceptively small-scale neo-noir Japanese crime thriller with a propulsive B-movie sensibility and a mournful Spaghetti Western-inspired sincerity, The Wolverine's accomplishment is sneakily profound in its influence having aged surprisingly well even if the third act nearly derails the whole experience. Thanks to James Mangold's breathtakingly suspenseful direction, tense action sequences and exquisite production, offering a surprisingly existential digression from the usual X-Men exploits. The film's tight focus during the first two acts sadly doesn't come full circle, with Mangold being forced to include a climax which feels tonally at odds and completely out of place with the rest of the film, but one that still manages to maintain a lot of winning dialogue. With its grounded and introspective look into its titular character, the film digs deep into the mind of Wolverine, giving Jackman the chance to put his investment in the character on full display. He's a commanding presence throughout, world-weary and battle-worn taking the opportunity to test the character's physical and emotional extremes. The rest of the cast is all extremely well realised even if I feel the overt focus on Svetlana Khodchenkova's Viper feels misplaced in a film like this, especially given the presence of the incredible Hiroyuki Sanada, but Famke Janssen is a welcomed return as a manifestation of Jean personifying Logan's waning instincts. Marco Beltrami offers up a relatively gorgeous oriental-inspired score, befitting the film's sumptuous locations. A philosophical divide, maybe, but one to ponder, signifying a stepping stone towards their later triumph... in Logan, Wolverine accepts death; in The Wolverine, Logan learns to live again.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hugh Jackman is the PERFECT Wolverine. GREAT film!,"The Wolverine is a movie that manages to carve a smarter, fresher niche in the genre that Fox has had trouble reaching before now. It's a wonderful character study first and a great adventure film second. I applaud this smarter approach.In this film we finally get to see the depth of character that makes Logan one of Marvel's best all-around anti-heroes. I'm not one of those crybabies that hated the Origins movie but I always felt they could have done better with the character. Wolverine deserves better than any ""7/10 not bad"" movie. Well, Logan FINALLY gets a high caliber pay off with this film.A true movie first, Wolverine is the most entertaining film of the summer season because it plays it just right. It didn't try to jump on the dark film bandwagon just for the sake of playing with grim emotions. The balance and depth it finds makes it a special film and what results was a true joy to watch on its own. Honestly, other releases this summer have disappointed because they couldn't deliver intelligence or heart with their characters. Wolverine should have patrons intrigued and enthused as they savor a movie done right. It's a perfect balance of intensity, pathos and action. It's the story that only Logan in Japan could deliver and it's as close as we've seen to getting the Logan from the books.I don't expect any movie version to become the literary version because you really can't compete with 40 years of character development and you also can't make any movie figure an unstoppable killing machine. Yet, they come very close. As a fan, I did have a problem with the character's power level in the movie franchise. He seemed to get KO'd so easily in the trilogy. Sabretooth KO'd him (for hours?) with one swing from a tree branch. Magneto KO'd him on the train by slamming him in to the back wall. Also, a single regular (non-adamantium) bullet to the forehead sends him down in X2. They make Logan tougher and formidable in this film yet they flip it all and make him vulnerable. This adds texture and ups the stakes. Thus, it makes the film so much more intense and enjoyable. Hugh Jackman is the PERFECT Wolverine and now maybe certain fanboys will be forced to acknowledge just that fact. For those of us that already enjoyed his work, this film is a special treat because it's the best the character has ever looked and been portrayed in live action.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rating for Directors edition; editing ruined theater release into silly Marvel flick,"Without seeing the Director's Edition, this film makes little sense & sadly deserves low ratings.THIS rating is after viewing the well written ""director's edition""'on blue ray yrs ago. The snippets of vital character development throughout this film for all Japanese leads & Hugh were thoughtlessly gutted, causing loss of any emotional connection viewer would have developed or at least plot understanding.Theatrical release & streamed film is a disconnected bare bones action flick without sense, without why, without relationships; lots of puzzling nonsensical plot holes.Sadly, the removed scenes were not long, maybe totaling 12 minutes, but were CRUCIAL to understanding plot, twists, & characters, & Wolverine exposed to a different culture. Some stereotypes, but nothing insulting; costumes, sets,& ppl were shown as different, not inferior.When I 1st saw the main theatre release, I was bored & lost, having NO clue of any characters identity nor their motives, incl Wolverine. The plot shown was hollow.After seeing Director's cut on DVD, I understood the interconnected interesting relationships among the characters, plot twists, esp Wolverine's role in the film with lead actors.Sadly, the screen writers must've been heartbroken that a well crafted story was ruined by apathetic editing. All the Japanese actors speak English well, so subtitles are NOT inIf one is fortunate to see ""director's version,"" viewer will enjoy this film instead of dismissing it as poorly made Marvel film like ""Dark Phoenix"" & ""Days of Future Past""; both ""X men"" films that were zero plot time wasters, just $$ makers.Why the Director's cut is never streamed is puzzling, as it would be viewed by more ppl & gain rep for being at minimum an interesting film with HJ still in his prime.

Kinda....meh,"I liked X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Yeh, sure it's despised by a lot of the X-Men movie fan community and the comic book purists, but I quite enjoyed it the first time I saw it and while recent viewings of it didn't leave the same impact, it's still a movie I wouldn't mind watching every couple of eons. Of course, it's only my perspective, so I have to be quite honest when expressing my thoughts on a motion picture or picture show. That being said, the semi-sequel to X-Men Origins, simply titled The Wolverine is, well, kind of mediocre in my eyes. I didn't really have all that high of expectations for this film and it wasn't atop my MUST SEE list of 2013. But, after seeing the film twice now, I think the film is okay, but not a personal favorite.I was never a big fan of the storyline where Wolverine travels to Japan, fights Silver Samarai and all that jazz to begin with, so I didn't really know what they were doing with this one, not what to expect.There were good action scenes and great character development for our main player, once again played by Hugh Jackman, but part of me was constantly saying ""I've seen this stuff a million times"". A million and one wouldn't have hurt, but I really wanted to see something unique, something fresh and innovative, something that was never done in an X-Men movie before. Of course Wolverine gets his claws covered in blood for the first time on film and the whole plot about Yashida taking his healing powers was very interesting, but most of the time, it felt like Wolverine just going around, stabbing people with his claws and smooching with the ladies.A million times.Sure, it's cool to see Wolverine being haunted by the ghost of Jean Grey, who he had to skewer in The Last Stand and the main female character, Yukio is beautiful, but at some parts, I wanted to drift off to slumberville. Some parts, I wanted to walk away and make my own assumptions on how the movie would end. The movie just didn't seem all that appealing to me. Now remember, it's just my opinion and if you like this movie, that's perfectly fine. Everyone has a different taste. But I really wouldn't want to watch this one that often. It was bland at some parts, mediocre in others and my overall verdict of the film is.....mehI liked some of the effects and the whole Japan environment is nice to look at, but I really don't have that much to say about this one. I really couldn't give a fist full of adamantium claws. It's just okay.Hopefully, X-Men: Days of Future Past will be a zillion times better.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Great comic book adaptation! 7/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this epic movie which had a great storyline and some brilliant action. It was good to see that they done something great with the Wolverine character and that Hugh Jackman done a great job portraying the comic book hero. I don't really have that much bad to say about the movie, but it was a bit long and, for some unknown reason, not very remember-able. When you see the movie for the first time, you will be impressed, but it's not the type of movie that you can see time and time again like Star Wars or some of the Batman's. I'm still yet to see the really moody side to Wolverine, which I have heard about in the comics, and the character does lack some wit and cockiness, but he does kick butt well. In all, a very watchable movie which I found quite entertaining. Enjoyable!Round-Up: I wasn't that impressed with the first Wolverine movie, because it didn't really live up to the hype, but I did find this one much better. The ending does make me want to see what they are going to do with the next X-Men movie, if they actually introduce Wolverine into the franchise properly, and I hope that the next Wolverine brings in some other superheroes. As for Hugh Jackman, it's a bit hard watching some who sang and danced at the Oscars and sang his way through Les Miserables, play such a deep character such as Wolverine, but he does play the part well. With the amount of money that it made, the audiences must have been happy with this adaptation so I'm sure that were going to see Hugh Jackman playing this role again.Budget: $120million Worldwide Gross: $415millionI recommend this movie to people who are into the Wolverine and X-Men franchise and who like there action comic book hero movies. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It then becomes a Japanese crime thriller before turning back into a full-blown sci-fi battle to the death.The plot works well to make us feel for Wolverine and his loss. He goes from burnt-out soldier to full-on warrior again during the story.The Jean Grey parts work OK but they tie this movie to the blah that was X-Men: The Last Stand.

One of the Best X-Men Movies to Date,"The Wolverine is Fox's 2012 superhero attempt to bring in success, much like 2011's X-Men: First Class. Unlike every other X-Men film to date, The Wolverine takes place entirely out of the U.S. with parts in Canada and the rest in Tokyo, Japan. Also unlike every other X-Men film to date, Wolverine is the only X-Man in this one as he battles a evil Tokyo family, Viper, and The Silver Samurai. This film definitely takes risks, but unlike Wolverine's last solo film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the risks pay off big time. The script and story are both very believable and realistic apart from a few instances of predictability and some corny dialogue. Also, The acting is very good. This, in my opinion, is Hugh Jackman's finest outing playing the lone wolf Wolverine. Also, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, and Svetlana Khodchenkova give very good performances. Other good performances come from Famke Janssen, Will Yun Lee, and Hal Yamanouchi. The story is filled with depth and darkness, and the action in this film never fails to amaze, especially the train fight. The cinematography is very good apart from some shaky camp, the production design is incredible as everything is gorgeous, the costume designs are very good as well, and the musical score by Marco Beltrami is very intense and epic, much like Hans Zimmer's for this year's Man of Steel. The direction by James Mangold was spot-on as he takes a deeper, darker, and more intense look into the lore of Wolverine as it is believable that he might actually die in the end. All in all, this is a very, VERY good movie and take on the Wolverine in a darker, grittier manner with very good acting from Hugh Jackman and the crew and impressive action.My Grade = A (8.7/10)Also, stick around for the credits as you will be pleased with one of the best after-the-credits scenes in a long while.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"EXPECTATIONS were High, Outcome was Bad, Super disappointing.","Because of all the hype created around the film the expectations became high for the film but sorry to say movie was bad, not like SUPER BAD but was bad. After X-men: First class i thought some good work would be implemented on this film but the scenario remains same as ORIGINS. I call this movie bad because of the Boring pace of the film. The romance between Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) and Mariko(Tao Okamoto) was so not required but still it was present and to test the patience, was also given a large importance. We like Wolverine Cut through but not make love to. And the fight sequences were so exaggerated pre-release but they fall flat. Without giving out much i'll sum it up. Watch it if your a fan of X-men series and Wolverine else AVOID. Expecting something big from DAYS OF FUTURE PAST.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One of the best this summer,"""Eternity can be a curse . . . a man can run out of things to live for."" Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi)Mythology and poetry are rife with stories about gods who envy men, their emotions and even their deaths. The Wolverine admirably mixes this motif with some very fancy camera and foot work in one of the best sci-fi hero films of the summer.Points should be given to director James Mangold and his writers for relocating the long-nailed hero, Logan (Hugh Jackman), to Japan, where samurai stories glorify lonely heroes with super battle powers. The contrast between his states-side forest home, where he strolls alongside a big bear that pees at will, and the glittering Tokyo with its perfectly appointed, exotic interiors, stresses the ambivalent world of a hero who wants to retire but is drawn back into civilization by his mission to be a soldier seeking justice.Because it's an action film, The Wolverine is practically required by law to have memorable set pieces, Mangold doesn't disappoint. The mano a mano fight atop a 200 MPH bullet train is as good as any Bond battle. While the struggle with a giant Iron-Man/Transformers type mechanical enemy (why don't they see how awkward these metal monsters are?) is also a traditional contemporary sci-fi trope, Logan has drawn us so much into this sympathy that there's an extra anxiety in the suspense.Unusual for a summer super hero film, Logan is surrounded by strong, intelligent women such as his tough ""body guard,"" Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who has a wildly scarlet wig; and femme fatale Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova and an appropriate stand-in for Uma Thurman), whose serpentine tongue should make most sane men slither away. Come to think of it, she does characterize herself rather humorously: ""A chemist, a nihilist, a capitalist . . . a viper.""Actually I miss the constant joking of a Bond film—there just isn't enough wisecracking as when Logan fights Viper and says, ""I can do this all day, you twisted mutant bitch!"" As effective as these mutants are, when Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen arrive on the scene, I am exultant. Nothing like seasoned actors exuding wisdom to make a critic cry in happiness.I'm satisfied to have a thoughtful and fun actioner toward the end of summer while feeling comfortable that Logan will return: ""A lot of people have tried to kill me... and I'm still here.""",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Time-Pass Entertainer!,"The sixth installment in the X-Men Film Series, 'The Wolverine' is a decent watch, that works until it lasts.

The Wolverine is A Good Movie!,"The film takes as reference the graphic novel by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller where Wolverine goes to Japan despite the film having caught this plot which is held at HQ I, Wolverine, the film is not 100% the same as the comics have many differences, however the film brings their own qualities. The film follows as a direct continuation of the third film of the Trilogy X-Men 3 The Last Stand, the course of the film it is possible to note how Logan is upset because of what happened to Jean Grey, at various times he has dreams about her and this serves as a settling into the fabric to form a unique personality of the character. Soon the beginning of the film is very exciting, however in the course of the movie experience becomes different, Wolverine loses his healing factor and leaves the film tiring for an extended period and really gives up sleep, it's boring. In the final moments of the film, the experience improves again as the film becomes exciting. During the film is shown a considerable amount and characters each with their personalities, the action is also very good both the Primary and Secondary Characters, Mariko (Tao Okamoto) has a key role in the plot, but on occasion lose direction and is all unbalanced, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) Encorporou the character very well. The fight scenes though few are excellent, nothing too much blood and be headings as many would like to see, but are exciting. there is a good amount of times that portrays the Japanese culture during the entire movie dialogs with locals are entirely in Japanese which demonstrates a tone of originality. the soundtrack is OK, we have some very exciting music, and special effects also OK, we also villains like the Viper and the Silver Samurai, both are compelling. And by the end, be sitting in the chair until the end because we have a post credits scene, it is Incredible! one of the most exciting scenes ever made into a movie, which is directly linked to the next movie Mutants: X-Men Days of Future Past. In order Wolverine: Immortal is a good movie despite some flaws in the film as the wearing parts and even the very fabric of the plot and the film does not fail to be good, and no doubt is a film that represents the character pretty well. although not what many would like to see, the film has its qualities.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine is Deep and Ferocious!,"Remember that Wolverine movie that was suppose to be a character origin story and had Will.i.am in it and the iconic ""Deadpole"" character dying? That horrible movie that left people crying and was called ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine""? Forget it. This is the stand-alone Wolverine movie Wolvy deserved! Beginning with a flashback taking place in Japan during World War II, Nagasaki is about to be bombed and Wolverine is a prisoner (great scene). With Japanese troops committing ritual suicide, Wolverine saves a soldier that decides to set him free. Decades later to present time, Logan is a disturbed, shaken Wolverine, still dealing with the downsides to immortality and Jean Gray's death and being haunted by Jean's spirit. After paying visit to the soldier, now one of the richest men in Japan, Wolverine is given a choice to have his immortality taken from him and live a normal life. After loosing his ability to heal and being vulnerable for the first time, Wolverine must face dangerous samurai, acid-spitter ""Viper"" (who wears a lot of goofy green dresses), and a robotic silver samurai! Hugh Jackman has never been better in this role! Jackman is Wolverine. Even in the slow parts of the film, Jackman reals you back into it. The Wolverine is a character film with a lot of pros and few cons that ultimately end up as a fun summer super-hero movie.

"Not a good action movie, but...","...at least I could enjoy Japan, the cute and the beautiful girl, a really fantastic train fight scene, the play of Hugh Jackman* and partly the background story.Unluckily director Mangold is not the right guy for that kind of movie. He seems to be more the character guy, not the action one. Although there is quite a lot potential for amazing fight scenes, what he makes out of it is more like a storm in a bathtub, than a hurricane. But as already mentioned except the train scene! Usually I just need the right amount of action (for example Transformers is too much for me), but this movie is lacking too much. Even an unsure and insecure, broken and lost Wolverine Jackman can't make up for this.In the beginning you see a depressed Wolverine/Logan, that gives some new insight. If you like Japan, you can find a lot of truth in the second part, shortcut, but somehow realistic. The climatic fighting scene in the last act on the other hand has the usual sci-fi/fantasy touch and is just silly and boring.To sum it up: This movie has good intentions, some good scenes, but is like the Japanese Alps: Up and down, up and down. If you don't watch it, you have nothing missed.*compared to other superhero actors, but he looses to ""Iron Man"" Robert Downey Jr.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
All the rubbish from Origins sprinkled with a bit more action,"Murder....Fox should be charged with the Murder of Logan, they destroyed his character in Origins and they did it again in The Wolverine..The action was good but the story was dreadful.its hard to make a film good when the hero is unkillable, im mean sure the whole venom thing was a nice touch but after taking 40 bullets around the body, 15 shotgun shells to the chest and 15 knife stabs he was still standing and was fine without his ability to heal. the funny this is his claws come out numerous times when poisoned but his hands didn't bleed or show signs of injury...its just a really poor thought out film.it was like watching someone stomp in flies no matter who he was against they had no chance to win and it made the film dull and boring to watch.the rights need to be converted back to Marvel with an entire xmen re- boot done right IMO ;/ we'll never the comic book movie the characters deserved with Fox's ""we'll keep sending out the same nonsense crap"" attitude.7.4 rating at the moment this is why film of this calibre keep getting made because people are happy with mediocre films and it will never change...good on you..good on you :)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I Dream of Jeannie.,"Strangely it took me all of nine years to get to this bland Wolvie side quest which takes a veiny Jackman to Japan for basically little to no reason. He keeps dreaming fitfully of a Jean Grey in her nightie and seems tired - everyone else is either angry or sad. Criminally, this seemed a little worse than the risible Origins to me because it spent so much time being melodramatic or just dull. Nice effects though but when the best thing in a film is its mid-credits sequence you know you've done something wrong.

A Movie With So Much Angst,"""The Wolverine"" begins with a scene at the end of World War II with the bombing of Nagasaki. Under such harsh circumstances, Logan (Hugh Jackman) strikes a friendship with a Japanese soldier, Yashida (Ken Yamamura).Fast forward to the present time, Yashida (now played by Haruhito Yamanouchi), now the taipan of a big business enterprise (on his amazing futuristic deathbed), summons Logan to Japan to say his parting words before he dies. When he gets there though, Logan got more than what he bargained for, as his very immortality lay on the line.Hugh Jackman is the perfect Wolverine. By now, we all know looks the part and acts the part from previous X-Men films, and this film is no different. Logan will experience something new from this film that challenges him like never before, and Jackman was more than able to project that challenge. We will feel his pain. He carried this heavy film like no other actor could.Logan will have two Japanese ladies behind him. First is Mariko (the beautiful Tao Okamoto), the statuesque granddaughter and future heir of the Yashida fortune. Second is Yukio (the anime-cute Rila Fukushima), a quirky red-haired ward of Yashida who was also a very able fighter. Both ladies performed very well in their respective roles.This film is a very heavy drama with occasional bursts of exciting action. Some fans looking forward to nonstop slash fights may be disappointed. The best fight scene was that one on the roof of the bullet train, and that happens in the first hour. I also enjoyed all the well-orchestrated Japanese-style sword fights and archery scenes, but these were fewer than I expected.Save for a brief scene about a bath near the start, there was absolutely no relief from the overwhelming angst that pervades this movie. Everybody was frowning or angry almost the whole time. And this film lasts for more than two hours. Some viewers may find all this rage too much to bear.I found this a very well-made film by Director James Mangold. I liked the intense Wolverine it painted. I liked the Japanese setting and cultural references. I liked the artsy scenes featuring Famke Janssen as Jean Grey. I really like the extra scene during the final credits, now that is really exciting.However, as a whole the tone may have been too turgid or intense to be considered entertaining. Fans should go watch it as it is a very good film, but do not expect it to be as commercial as the other X-Men films for the average moviegoers. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An action hero with struggles,"The superhero that struggles with himself.Many years after a nuclear incident where he saved the life of a soldier, this soldier ask to see Wolverine before he passes away. This invitation however has a hidden agenda and sets the motion for the film's plot.Just when he convinced himself that his invincibility is a curse, Wolverine realises he needs it more than ever in order to save someone he has come to care for deeply. However at the time of his need and due to the trap set by the so called old friend, he has lost some and therefore the struggle is twice as intense and so are the action scenes.It has become a bit of trend in Hollywood recently for the superhero to face struggles and it was with joy that in this film, the effort of making it more character driven did not come at the expense of the cinematic enjoyment. Ultimately, this is a science-fiction/action film and that ought not be ignored.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Proof that Marvel movies are getting better,"(67%) A refreshing change of pace and tone from all the other superhero movies that are relentlessly made these days that focuses as much attention on character as it does action. This is a well made leap forward over the last Skip Woods written Wolverine picture, with a lot more depth, ideas, and purpose, with Jackman fitting into the role perfectly as he always has from the beginning. The story is pretty simple, yet there are complexities in there dealing with loss of loved ones and human mortality which is handled well in a movie that could have simply not bothered. Overall a good, solid superhero entry to go alongside the best of the bunch.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Logan trips on acid, fights the Yakuza & Ninjas, catches yellow fever","I love the X-Men movies. The first three were endearing and fun movies with spectacular set- pieces, fun character interaction, and classic stories. I even liked Wolverine's Origin movie for what it was, though I understand why it let down so many fans.But mostly, I love Logan the immortal Wolverine, the hopeless romantic, the loner, the leader, and the unstoppable hero.I had such unwarranted, high expectations for this movie that I was bound to be let down, and I hold literally nothing against the rest of the series, but this one felt like a cop-out.A safe little one-off campaign to whet our appetites, to reverse the damage from ""Origins"".The characters are bland and boring. There are only maybe 5 main characters, being generous, and that's a Japanese family and Logan. I don't remember any mutant powers besides the archer.Half the movie was zoom-in shots of each character's face, pointless and awkwardly paced- It didn't even feel like an X-Men movie. And a carnal sin of comic-book movies, it was frequently boring and slow!Half of the movie is Logan having dreams of Jean Grey, again and again, very boring.Wolverine takes down literally EVERY opponent in the movie in one swing of his claws. One! Every time! The whole, ""make you mortal"" plot line didn't go Anywhere!!! Nothing Effing Happened!There were two decent fight scenes. The train scene, which honestly was kinda stupid, and the final battle which was a let-down in too many ways.I haven't read this story, but it was a great idea and instead it feels like a one-off Japanese Wolverine movie. It's like Fox out-sourced the movie to some Japanese production company who just had no idea what to do with the material.Dialogue blows, fighting is boring, characters are weak the only mutant powers on display are Logan's ""slower"" regeneration and a guy with perfect aim and a crossbow. And the scene where that girl cuts the barstool and the glass with the sword are the ONLY times sword-play is used effectively.Days of Future Past, I'm counting on you",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Wolverine Review,"Wolverine has been through so much. In spite of that, he remains one of the biggest superheroes of comic-book legend, and thanks to Hugh Jackman's performance in four previous X-Men movies, he became one of the biggest cinematic icons of modern times. Even though the character received his stand-alone film in 2009, filmmakers wanted to go farther and deeper with the character. Taking after Chris Claremont's and Frank Miller's comic, The Wolverine would test the character's limits in Japan.This film is nowhere near as overblown as other X-Men films: the action is confined to just a few fights. Some of the highlights include a fight on top of a high-speed bullet-train, confrontations with a small army of ninjas, and a final showdown with a giant armored samurai suit. These are fairly cool fights that show off quality choreography and a few cool weapons, but there's very little wow factor. The film does satisfy in the same way thrillers like The Man From Nowhere or Crying Freeman do, but it feels far less like a superhero movie, or even an X-Men movie. Those searching for big, explosive action might be let down, but there is still merit in this moody, slow-burning drama.The Wolverine takes its time to breathe, giving a steady focus on the title character. It is a much-needed character study; as a sequel to X-Men: The Last Stand, Wolverine is a broken man, tormented by guilt and deprived of purpose. As he travels to Japan and becomes caught up in a major conspiracy, he is revealed to be a figurative ronin: a master-less samurai struggling to regain his honor, perhaps even through death. Due to these issues, and with the threat of taking away his healing powers, this is Wolverine at his most vulnerable, and it makes for a very intense struggle. The conflict runs good and hard throughout the story, and the plot is well-structured. The story has a dense layer of conspiracy that's not exactly easy to comprehend, especially with so many side characters, but other parts are predictable. At the film's core, however, strong parallels are drawn between Wolverine and the Bushido code, and it makes for a rather compelling show.This film uses pretty straightforward photography and editing, and it's refreshing that way. Acting is good: Hugh Jackman is still perfect as Wolverine, and the rest of the cast is decent and feels authentic. Writing is good. This production uses good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Locales in particular look authentic, and it helps, since the setting plays a major role in this story. Music is not bad either.The Wolverine is the film the character deserves, with emphasis on ""THE"" to indicate that this is not just another plain ol' superhero flick, but an exploration on the character and his quest for absolution. Viewers might find this dull, but it exceeded my expectations in spite of the dramatic aspects. In the end, I enjoyed watching the character, both for the action and for the melodrama. It is a worthwhile experience overall.This film has an extended cut available on specific home video editions. It is an evenly-paced cut that boasts some longer dialogue and longer action scenes (primarily with the ninja fight toward the end), including a little more R-rated cursing and a bit more bloodshed. For mature audiences, it's not a bad cut of the movie.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Too much hype. Disappointed,"After a wait of more than four years following what many considered to be a average movie at best we get The Wolverine. X-Men Origins: Wolverine was attacked by most people and caused a big backlash that was probably the cause of this film being pushed back for four years. I'll admit I was not one who hated or tore apart Origins. I enjoyed that film. This film however not so much.The biggest complaint I have is with the story. Mark Bomback and Scott Frank both wrote this film. The same people who brought us Total Recall(remake) and Live Free or Die Hard. So the story being a bit overly boring shouldn't have surprised me but it did. Often times films fail to keep your interest for a run time such as this film has which is just about two hours. The Wolverine starts out nicely with a good story and it seems like it will go in a good direction. Sadly this film often slows for a good period of time and takes awhile to pick back up. The action scenes were amazing however but the lack of interesting story diminishes that aspect since after each amazing action scene we are stuck with boring and overly long dialogue.Director James Mangold is truly one of my favorite directors. He has brought us such films such as Cop Land, Identity, Walk the Line, and 3:10 to Yuma. The directing in this film is actually very good. Mangold knows how to direct a high flying action scene as he has been doing that for so many years now. No worries about a shaky cam here during the big action scenes which adds a lot to the film. There are some problems with this film however the directing from James Mangold is not one of them.The acting comprised with mostly foreign actors throughout the film is actually very good. Supporting actors and actress like Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, Brain Tee, and Hal Yamanouchi all work together very well as a family in this film. The chemistry is there and you can tell. Then there is Svetlana Khodchenkova who plays the role of Viper. She comes off as completely out of place and doesn't fit in the role of all. Yet another downside to the film. Hugh Jackman however puts in another great performance as The Wolverine. From the start Jackman has dominated this role and after fourteen years he still plays the role with the same force and same energy.Overall this film is just above average. There is one lone item that truly saves this film and that scene comes about a minute into the credits. I'm not going to spoil it however make sure you stick around to see it. The scene is amazing and sadly for this film it is the best scene of the movie. Overall I would give this movie a 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's one heck of an entertaining and smart movie.,"There is not one wasted line, visual, camera angle or wasted development in this entire movie. Everything serves to either advance the plot or flesh out and develop a character. It was smart, tight and lean and superbly done. I truly think that this is the best movie of the summer. How could you not like it? It doesn't payoff prior installments or set up future ones, it's a great film all by itself. It seems to exist almost out of time, for the simple purpose of pitting its iconic mutant anti-hero against the perfect threats. Who doesn't like samurais, ninjas, and vicious yakuza thugs? You can still see the attempt to tie this film to events from the trilogy but it all works neatly and tightly and you really need not have seen those other films. The Wolverine is certainly a movie that I want to see again. It's one heck of an entertaining and smart movie.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Immortality and Healing Power,"Logan (Hugh Jackman) has become a hermit, living in the woods alone and haunted by nightmares with Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). One day, the Japanese girl Yukio (Rila Fukushima) that is skilled with a samurai sword visits Logan and tells that her grandfather, the powerful businessman Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), is dying and wants to see him for the last time before dying. Yashida was a Japanese soldier that Logan saved the life in Nagasaki in the World War II.Logan travels Japan with Yukio and the moribund Yashida offers mortality to Logan, transferring his gift to him, but Logan does not accept the offer. While sleeping, Logan has a weird dream with Yashida's doctor Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) and soon Yashida dies. Logan stays for the funeral and the Yakuza tries to abduct Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) during the ceremony. Logan saves and flees with Mariko, but he is shot and does not heel the wounds. Logan protects Mariko and tries to find what has happened to him.""The Wolverine"" is a great action movie, with Logan facing the lost of his immortality and healing power. The story has many holes, but maybe the worst are the complicated plan of Yashida to steal Logan's powers since Logan could have been killed while protecting Mariko (wouldn't be much easier to drug him in Yashida's house and bring him to the fortress to get his powers?), and Viper's motivation since it is not clear whether she is plotting the scheme for herself or for Yashida. But the movie entertains and does not disappoint at all. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Wolverine Immortal"" (""Immortal Wolverine"")",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This is definitely underrated and what I call a slow burner. The worst of the bunch imo is Origins, X3 and Apocalypse.

Solidly enjoyable even if it is not as memorable as it should have been,"I'm not sure if this film counts as sequel or a reboot or what but it certainly feels like another run at making a Wolverine film rather than a sequel to the first attempt at it. From the very start the tone is noticeably darker which I guess is to try and placate fans who don't like the family friendly version of the character that was more or less served up before. Although this dark edge isn't really present in more than the mood, it is a more satisfying tone to the film and it engaged me more as a result. The second thing it did well was to set the vast majority of the film in Japan and to blend the reality of the country (tradition, bullet trains, pachinko arcades) with the version that will appeal to the target audience comic book fans (beautiful women, samurai, ninjas etc).This setting gives the film an sense of cool that matches that of its central character and of course of its main star. This cool factor helps it a lot because the plotting is not particularly strong; good enough to frame the film but nothing special. Unfortunately the same can be said about the action. It is perfectly fine for what it is but in terms of action sequences there was only really one scene that I felt was pushing me and showed ambition and this was the action spreading out across Tokyo in the daytime. Outside of this there are some good martial arts scenes and then lots of CGI nonsense – all of which was fine but no more than this. I enjoyed the film but I never got away from the sense that this was a very careful film; the reaction to the previous had not been great and it felt like it was really making effort to not mess things up. This lack of real flair or risk taking was apparent and, while not enough to really hurt the film, certainly didn't see it excel.The cast are as reliable as the film as a whole. Jackman is as good as Wolverine as he has ever been and he makes the most of his haunted and violent character; it really is a character that he was born to fit. Looking like she came right out of a graphic novel, Fukushima is a cool presence as ""bodyguard"" Yukio while Okamotois suitably fragile. Outside of this Will Yun Lee is cool in a rather obvious character but is underused. Khodchenkova does feel a little like someone who wouldn't have made the cut into the main X-Men movies and she didn't have the sexual presence that the film needed, even if she had the looks. The supporting cast of Japanese standard characters are fine and do what is asked of them.The Wolverine is a solid, safe film which is enjoyable for what it does even if I would have liked more from it. It plays things safe for the most part, giving the viewer more or less what they expect but not pushing things beyond that. It'll do the job but it never has the style, flair, imagination or cruelty that I had hoped it would bring.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely NOT what the fans want !,"How many times have we seen that one cliché movie ? Well, actually too many to remember, and this particular movie will go down as another one of those movies which will ultimately be forgotten. You expect more from not only Jackman but also from the brand Wolverine. And it pains me to say that the movie which starts of a little slower than its predecessor, although in a semblance more serious than ever before, makes you believe that you're in for a royal treat, turns into a very similar cat and mouse chase story in a matter of 20 minutes! Believe me when I say, you can predict everything that is going to happen after a certain point in the movie(And that point comes really early too but perhaps the most shocking part was that my predictions were absolutely spot on). If you just want to see Jackman act as wolverine like he usually does, raging on like wild, killing people etc, and you're not bored with this regiment then you can go watch it, but if you're looking for something more, something like a good intriguing story that captures your thought process and provides you with thrills (not just visual but mental as well) you were looking for in the very first place then you'd better avoid it, watch it on TV or something when you've got a lot of time to kill.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Worthy X-Men film,"The previous film 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' left everyone very disappointed (including me) and almost ruined the franchise so they had to make an effort with this one to get the fans back on-board. 'The Wolverine' is certainly a much better film where they put the story more than the action and VFX in front. It's a sequel to X3 (where the X-Men disbanded) in which Logan struggles with is immortality and ends up getting involved with a Japanse company promising him to relieve him of this burden. The story and character centric approach does mean that the pace is much slower and sometimes they spend just too much time on the characters without really adding much depth. Cutting 15 to 20 mins out of this 138 min movie would certainly have helped. The action sequences we do get are well done with excellent VFX and they do try to be inventive and show some stuff we haven't seen before. Altogether a worthy X-Men film but not the best in series. BTW at the end of the film there is a short scene with Xavier and Magneto which sets us up for 'X-Men: Days of Future Past', a film of which expect allot more and which hopefully will be the best in the series, the trailers look interesting to say the least :)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"another pointless standalone sequel with an all too familiar, straightforward and predictable plot","The Wolverine is another pointless standalone sequel with an all too familiar, straightforward and predictable plot.The Wolverine is slightly better compared to X-Men Origins: Wolverine in terms of plot but suffers by a series of unrealistic plot contrivances.Most of the supporting characters are given little or no character development throughout the film, they're just simply there for the sake of story progression.There's nothing wrong with Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine, he showed his dedication ('Wolverine gym workout') and delivered his best portrayal of the character throughout the X-Men series. The problems lies on the script and the character himself. Although the film is loosely based on the 1982 Wolverine comic set in Japan, but is he a compelling character enough to earn 2 spin-offs in the franchise? The film never takes time to explore the temporary physical vulnerability experienced by Logan...how he feels and deals with the sudden change of his immortality. There's no solid motive or reason why Logan need to stay or remain in Japan. He can choose to leave anytime he wants during the earlier stages of the film, instead he chose to stay to protect someone he barely even know or care about. Furthermore, the relationship between Mariko and Logan feels forced and doesn't seem credible or real, they just barely know each other and the lack of on-screen chemistry between the lead actors makes it even worst.The film briefly mentioned about family honour, respect and love, but one would question about Mariko's action near the end of the 3rd act of the film.The action scenes didn't offer anything new (most of them done before by previous X-Men movies) and I'm probably one of the few who doesn't find the 300mph bullet train fight scene exhilarating or cool at all.The highlight of the film seems to be the mid-credit scene that might excite a lot of X-Men fans, foreshadowing what is going to happen for the next X-Men movie - Days of Future Past.A lot of questions raised as to why and how it happened, a good scene to pique the audience interest about what to come next year.Recent superhero movies of the decade such as The Avengers and The Dark Knight Trilogy have showed us that superhero films can be something more...and what The Wolverine delivers simply isn't enough anymore. In my opinion, X-Men: First Class is still the best (in terms of character development, story flow, acting, plot) in the X-Men film series.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Waking the animal inside,"And putting him to sleep too, if you will. You've probably seen the trailer, but even if not, the movie itself is very predictable. You don't have to think too much to come up with what is going to happen. But the movie is still a lot of fun to watch. Has character moments and seems to be detached from the other Wolverine movie. Which means you don't have to have seen that.It actually does tell a sort of stand alone story. And since I'm not very familiar with the comic books I can't tell you, how close this is to them. Or if this is something that spans more than one story in the books or is made up. What I can tell you, is that it looks amazing and our hero does find himself in a predicament, that he himself created. Hugh Jackman is amazing once again",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More story and character than expected,"To my surprise this film is quite good. Largely because it focuses on story and character with humour thrown in for good measure. Action sequences and the superpowers support this film instead which makes this a far better film than just another superhero movie.The story could be called predictable. Logan is tormented over killing Jean Grey and shes her when awake and sleeping. Her presence and inherent craziness forces him to live as a homeless man in the wild. A chance to say goodbye to an old friend gives him a chance for redemption. Those of us who have seen this story before could predict the outcome however it is still interesting because Japan is an interesting setting, we want Logan to get the peace he deserves, and poignant action scenes give us a chance to see Logan vent his anger.Much better than I expected it to be.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

And yes - don't leave to movie theater during the end titles because there comes one scene more for a coming movie.Its a movie based on a comic, its fantasy...

Mutant Alone,"James Mangold directed this sixth ""X-Men"" entry, though the second to focus primarily on Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) which is set after the events of 'The Last Stand', as Wolverine, now living a nomadic existence in the wilderness, is located by a Japanese woman who tells him that a (now) wealthy Japanese man whose life he had saved in WWII(when the two atom bombs were dropped) is now dying, and wants to repay his life debt by offering him a chance to relinquish his immortality by transferring it to him through a new process. Wolverine respectfully refuses, but events spiral out-of-control as someone wants the man's daughter and heir dead, and also wants Wolverine's healing power, which threatens his indestructibility...

An Exceptional Film On Every Level!,"I just loved The Wolverine. I thought it was very well written and the impressive cast really delivered! Hugh Jackman finally gets a full film to bring the character to the next level. It's been delivered in flashes before but this entire movie is the Wolverine that I wanted to see. This is the character that I grew up with and have enjoyed since youth. Mangold should be commended for giving the film a subdued yet intense flavor. I think they captured the vibe of the classic Japanese story from the books wonderfully. They delivered an intelligent plot that featured the fantastic grounded in a believable reality. One of the difficulties with the character is placing him in situations where he is in true danger. That wasn't an issue here as they managed to intelligently do this on numerous occasions in a smart fashion. I was very impressed with the many great moments and fine character arcs in this one. The action is dark, perfectly suiting the character and the PG-13 rating was pushed right to the edge if not beyond it.I disagree with those that say the villains are poorly utilized. Viper may have been one dimensional but I consider her a throw away tool when the entire plot is taken in to consideration. Yashida was perfectly utilized and his actions not only drive the film but flesh out everyone's motivations perfectly. Shingen was everything the character needed to be.The true strength in the supporting cast is both Mariko and Yukio. Amazing renditions both.That bullet train scene DID live up to the hype. Short but oh so sweet! The best adventure film of the year. Yes, BETTER than Iron Man 3.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An attempt to keep the real fans happy,"Most are still waiting for that ""great"" x-men movie, and saw this as the chance to redeem a series that has disappointed so many. Who can blame them? ""The Wolverine"" is based on one of the more popular story lines from the comic books, so it really is an attempt to keep the real fans happy, in a way the last couple of movies have not. Which was already a good thing, before even having seen it.Aye this flick will no doubt wet the appetites of Wolverine fans, as he arrives in a scenic Japan. The movie is not without its flaws, but being set in Japan makes for a nice change (Much like the 60's setting did for ""X-men – first class""). This Movie has learnt from its predicesors mistakes, and isn't crammed with to many ideas or other mutant's, and there's plenty of action and character stuff, as well as lots of Hugh Jackman topless, to cater to the women dragged along by their boyfriends.Folk are still complaining however (and I'm about to join them). I'm not sure why others are winching, but I thought the final twist of ""Wolverines"" plot really ruined the whole darn thing. I love a twist when it makes sense. But this flicks final big reveal during the big finale is one of those questionable ones that pretty much ruins the whole plot of the movie.

Slightly Tarnishes the Legacy of the Brilliantly Received X-Men Franchise,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3/5 starsNot as good as any of the previous X-Men films, including the under- appreciated ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". Some actions scenes are very well done, but the rest fall pretty flat, including the anti-climatic finale. The plot does resemble one of our clawed superhero's fable comic books, but it isn't executed to perfection or anywhere near it. Plus, some necessary back-story's and character arcs weren't properly developed we are left feeling a bit cheated.In hindsight, if it wasn't for the charismatic Hugh Jackman, ""The Wolverine"" mightn't have even turned out to be half decent as it is. Here's hoping that Wolverine's next solo effort surpasses or is at least as good as the character's first cinematic installment.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

He fights on top of a bullet train with some yakuza thugs for several minutes, slashing long gaping holes in the top of the train, but no one in the train notices anything. Much of the story is dependant upon Wolverine actually sticking around in Japan. You know what, I said I wasn't going to do this, so yeah, the story sucks.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine is back!,"PLOT Logan (Hugh Jackman) lives as loner while he's still devastated and haunted by events that happened with Jean Grey in the third film of X- Men. He is found by a Japanese woman Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who delivers him a message from a man he rescued in 1945, called Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada). He is dying of cancer an would like to met Logan for the last time. Wolverine travels to Japan, meets Yashida's son Shingen (Hiroyuki Sanada) and granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) but soon realise that a county of samurai, ninjas and yakuza are very much real.REVIEW First of all, I'm a huge X-Men and Wolverine fan so let me get that straight. This film is really focused on Logan's character so consequently the movie is a character study first. If you expect mindless action you will be disappointed.Many fans were quite stroppy after the first Wolverine's film years back so this one is in a way a redemption. The reason lies in staying true to the comic's original panels although the story lines have been shifted and shuffled. Some fans are saying this superhero film is one of the best comic based movies but it's clear that you can never satisfy everyone.As I said before, Wolverine explores his inner conflicts, tries to distance himself from the rest of the X-Men, while facing immortality and soul searching. Hugh Jackman again delivers reprising Logan. His performance is strong and most supporting cast does a wonderful job as well. Setting is beautiful and it was so refreshing to see the traditional Japanese culture and non-Hollywood cast. Many films take place in some country but then we only see Americans in it.Action. To be honest, I expected more action-fighting scenes that would make more sense. Some of them felt a bit forced to me (for example when Yukio and Shingen fight). I understand that they wanted to include scenes because of film's dynamics but still.Sadly the writing is very two-dimensional for everyone other than Logan. I get that main focus is on Wolvie but other characters are underdeveloped yet there is so much potential for characters like Yukio, Kenuichio and Viper. Story could interlace in a more sophisticated way yet I can imagine how hard it is to adapt a story like this. I love the fact that women in the film are portrayed as strong but I wish there would be more to their stories. I also enjoyed a bit darker mood of the film, Jean Grey's appearances and occasionally humorous scenes.Main three thoughts that I got from watching The Wolverine: 1. he's freakin awesome (hands down to Hugh!); 2. I would like to see Logan and Yukio travel and kick some ass together; 3. aaaaaaaaa, can't wait for next year's X-Men: Days of Future Past!P.S.

A bit disappointing,"This film tells the story of Wolverine combating bad guys who targets the family of the man whom he saved in Japan during the Second World War.This is the second Wolverine spin off already in recent years, and hence this Wolverine has certain expectations to live up to. I find ""The Wolverine"" to be all talk and no action. There is so little action scene, and even the ending fight isn't that spectacular. Maybe Hollywood has spoilt viewers so much by the amazing visual effects, that ""The Wolverine"" looks rather underwhelming. The story is far too contrived too, especially the love story between Wolverine and Mariko. I find it very hard to believe that they would fall in love under the circumstances.As a big budget blockbuster, I think ""The Wolverine"" leaves much to be desired.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Western genre meets Eastern setting for a fresh take on a familiar hero.,"Hugh Jackman and Walk The Line director James Mangold make a modest... ahem... stab at rescuing The Wolverine from bloated too-many-mutants boredom with this stand-alone adventure that owes more to Clint Eastwood's man with no name than it does to the Stan Lee back-catalogue.Logan, once again alone and wandering the wilderness, is summoned to Japan by a man from his distant past and becomes caught up in a power struggle between the dynastic family of a powerful corporation, Yakuza gangsters, and some shadowy ninjas (are there any other type?).On the plus side, for at least two thirds of the movie this keeps The Wolverine grounded amongst real people; vulnerable, disorientated, and in grimly emotional turmoil. Hugh Jackman doesn't have to work very hard to pull this off, his powerful presence and comfortable familiarity with the role playing to the strengths of a tale that commendably cuts free of mutant hi-jinks for most of its running time, and indulges in some fairly obvious, but pleasingly underplayed culture-clash elements inherent in this setting.It's kind of a shame then that the film takes a jarring turn into the third act, feeling duty bound to deliver some big FX silliness. The tonal wrench feels deeply uncomfortable and also leaves great gaping holes in the arcs of previously intriguing characters.Not the disaster of his previous solo outing. There is good work in the brooding western-influenced tale and for the most part things coast along nicely on Jackman's effortless charisma. If only they could have held their storytelling nerve through to the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Like Shaking a Soda and Popping the Cap,"It starts off exciting enough but by midway through it fizzes out and ends up just making a mess everywhere. Jackman is great as Wolverine and his dedication to the role is admirable. I would have liked to seen the story grounded a little more as the world this movie exists in is definitely not a real one. Fight scenes are abundant and well done but a little too numerous and non-consequential. Plot annoyances arrive in the form of an unnecessary love interest and a giant ninja robot. Also, everyone in this film is a ninja because, you know, everyone from Japan is. If you like ridiculous action and overly staged fight scenes, then this will appeal. It feels like something a 15yr old would like, and I suppose that is where the target audience would be. Not a bad flick and worth the view if you are a fan of the Wolverine.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Logan, who continues to look for a place for himself","After the excellent film about People X ""First Class"", it was difficult to roll into this work. It still seemed good to me only after the third viewing. The film clearly lacks the scale that the previous film about mutants was endowed with, but over time I decided for myself that films about Wolverine and about X-Men should be divided. That's when the story feels much better.""Wolverine: The Immortal"" decides to explore Logan's life after the events of the ""Last Battle"", which ended on a seemingly positive note, but still left an indelible wound in the heart of the adamantium hero. The 2009 film told about the formation of Wolverine as we met him in the first film. ""Immortal"" goes further, telling about the aimless wanderings of a man who suffers from the fact that he basically exists in this world. In fact, this is quite a sad and even dangerous condition for a human or a mutant, which is Logan. It doesn't matter. For anyone. You can't live without a goal. It's toxic. And the picture perfectly demonstrates this line, where Wolverine constantly meets with his visions. Beloved Jean Gray continues to appear, comforting the man, but at the same time poisoning his mind more and more when he returns to the real world. This part of the film perfectly conveys the oppressive atmosphere.However, there are new adventures ahead, without which the film would not be the film that the audience is waiting for. The project opens Japan to us, where the main events await Wolverine. Logan will have to rethink his existence and his goals right here, when the hero suddenly realizes that his life is not over yet, there are those whom he can and should help.The screenwriters introduce the audience to several new characters from the mutant universe, among which I personally remember the Viper performed by Svetlana Khodchenkova. She turned out to be a worthy villain: dangerous, unattractive. And indeed, the girl seems to exude poison, the character was very unpleasant to me. And this is an absolute merit of the actress. Other actors are also good: Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, Tao Okamoto, Hal Yamanouchi and others. They are all in their places, organically fit into the narrative.The visual component is at a height. The film has a lot of combat scenes, stunts, chases, as befits such a project. However, from the point of view of drama, I would not say that the project creates a powerful effect. We could finish this aspect in the final, but in the end we have what we have.I would like to note that with all the pros and cons of the project, its main decoration is without a doubt Wolverine himself. Hugh Jackman is good in his role again. He gives his all 200 percent, fused with the hero, feels him, perfectly conveys the soul of the character. Hugh had already been in office for the second decade. You need to understand that he has studied this complex character perfectly, which is why he is so good.The picture is sure to please fans. As a result, this is still an entertaining movie, where some drama awaits in the first half because of Logan's inner demons. However, all of them will fade into the background when the narrative vector turns to events here and now. Then Wolverine will show himself to be a real beast, once again delighting fans of the franchise.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Watch the Extended Edition Way better than theatrical version !,"I was waiting so long to see this film. The only reason I disagreed with the negative reviewers is because some of them don't have much knowledge about the character Wolverine. For example, their confused of why doesn't he age because they clearly discuss this in the first X-men film when they find Logan. I'm a huge fan of X-men and I loved X-men First class. Anyways The Wolverine film that was shown in cinemas wasn't that great it was missing some explanations. Then I watched the Extended version which had an additional 14 mins and they've added blood to the fights. If you know the character Wolverine from the comics then you will fall in love with this movie. The extended version was the best superhero movie I've seen this year. Lastly without spoiling anything this version has something special after the credits showing a scene that takes place two years after the film. I give this movie a 10/10 because it is pure badass .

The Wolverine focuses more on character than spectacle.,"After the event of Last Stand, Logan has become a loner. He lives in the wilderness with his demons. Until a young woman enters his life with news that the man Logan once saved back in WWII when the US dropped the bomb on Nagaski, has asked to see him once more. He's dying and wants to offer Logan something no one ever thought could be true. His mortality.I still, to this day, wonder what this film would have been like had Aronofsky been behind the camera. Without a doubt it would have been a hard R rated spectacle with blood and violence. This Wolverine is the PG-13 version of what an R rated comic book film could be. It's violent, has harsh language and isn't set an wowing the audience, it instead has a story it wants to tell. Which is a step above what Wolverine had to go through with his origins tale and the atrocity that was Ratner's entry.The Wolverine sets itself apart from the other X-Men films by focusing mainly on the setting of this tale. Logan is now in Japan, something that the comic book readers will be familiar with as Japan plays a pretty big part of Logan's history. The change in local was a welcome addition as it gives the film a breath of fresh air about it. It stands out from the crowd, this is both a blessing and a curse. Why a curse? Well, I can't help but shake the feeling that this entry was ho-hum. I love that it tells a smaller story, a more focused story, but in the grand scheme of things is kind of feels pointless. It's like a side stop to sight see while we wait to continue on with bigger things.This film has a lot of issues, but nothing major that made me hate it. In fact, I liked it. This is probably one of the better entries in the series where Jackman has played this character a whopping 6 times. Here he looks leaner, meaner and more at ease with the character. Logan is haunted by his demons, mainly Jean Grey. Jackman plays the character with an emotional detachment, but also the need to belong. This character is a loner, he doesn't play well with others, but all he really wants is acceptance. Even if he says he doesn't.There are only three mutants in this film. Our titled hero, a one dimensional venomous vixen by the name of Viper and a redheaded martial arts expert who can see people's deaths in the future, Yukio. Rila Fukushima who plays Yukio, does well for herself against Jackman. She was impressive considering this is her first major role. Tao Okamoto plays Mariko, sister to Yukio and the target of the Yakuza. Logan takes it upon himself to protect her...maybe even fall for her in a forced there needs to be a love story kind of way.There are some twists in the film, that a child can see coming a mile away. Nothing too confusing in the plot that features assassination attempts, kidnapping, betrayal, family issues, etc. The most interesting aspect of this film is the fact that Logan has his healing power taken away from him. Now we have a guy who was once immortal (or close to) getting tired from simply chopping some wood. His healing powers are significantly slower, he bleeds, needs to see doctors and finally feels the pain. This raises the stakes for a once unstoppable character. One issues I had right away was that even with his healing powers gone, he shows no signs of pain or slowing down with his metallic claws rip through his hands. No sign of damage there. Big oversight from the filmmakers on that one.The Wolverine is an interesting character study. It has one showy fight sequence on a train, that walks the line of cartoonish. It's more concerned with the fact that this guy is an animal, a loner who goes by his own rules being thrown into a society that has honour, rules and obedience at the forefront. He is out of his element and the audience is unaware they are too for the first time in this characters life. Shoddy storytelling near the end involving Logan's power makes the film end with me scratching my head. Throw onto that a ballsy move the filmmakers decide to do with Logan and you've got my interest in the next film.Does it reflect badly on the film that I thought the best part of it was the after the credit sequence?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Met and then exceeded all expectations! Great film.,"The Wolverine is exceptional in every way. It's an awesome action flick that totally surpasses its predecessors. It ultimately stays true to its comic-book roots while finding a unique and believable pivot point for an outstanding film all on its own. Take out all the action and you'd still have an entertaining character drama. That says a ton.It's not just that this movie is more character driven yet still delivers thrilling action sequences, though that's true. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. The Wolverine starts with the perfect pace and springboards in to aspects of the classic Miller/Claremont Marvel Comics mini-series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with films in this genre. Too much of 2013 has given us good reason to equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. But the writers here are as interested in the subtext as they are in the high quality action. There's no denying that mutant powers are a tool but it's the character depth that really drives this film. They use state-of-the-art special effects to deliver a live-action version of the comic books. What fans already know, however, is that vintage Marvel books are classics because of intelligent writing as much as comic book flare and fantasy. The movie delivers tremendous story and skillfully weaves together character, plot and action. It's just plain spectacular on any level that you judge it.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Better than Man of Steel,"So, after 'X-Men' and 'X2', the X-Men series was doing very well. Then, they came out with 'X-Men: The Last Stand', which the general audiences did not care for. After that, there was 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine', which audiences didn't care for, either. In 2011, the X-Men series was brought back to life with 'X-Men: First Class'. That was movie was reviewed well by general audiences. Now, after the two X-Men prequels, we have a sequel to 'X-Men: The Last Stand'.'The Wolverine' stars Hugh Jackman, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Svetlana Khodchenkova. Hugh Jackman is of course great in this film, like he always has been as wolverine. The wolverine is Hugh Jackman. He nails the role in every way. The rest of the cast and the supporting cast also do very well. I had no doubt that any of them were who they portrayed in their role. Svetlana Kohchenkova did really well as the main antagonist in the film. She had that ""bad guy"" feeling that went along with her the whole time. The only problem I have with the acting is that some of the actors overacted their role. They brought the acting too far and it was over the top.The story was also good. It had a clear conflict, adventure, and task at hand for most of the time. When it got to then, it wasn't like that, but the end was only a little part of the film. For most of the film there are certain reasons characters fight, and what they fight for. They have their motivations and their weaknesses. The characters were all very rich. They didn't need to do much character development on wolverine because we know who he is, but they let us know what he is like now. It also developed the other characters well and gave them back stories. 'The Wolverine' was not all about wolverine. It was about the situation at hand and many of the characters. It was still focused, but it didn't stay on one thing the whole time.The writing for the movie made it seem more realistic, and gave the characters more depth. It helped us know them better and care about them more. Sometimes it got a little unrealistic and illogical to the characters, but at the beginning of the film it made the characters what they were. Sometimes the dialog was clichéd, like when characters had situations and were in trouble, but for the mood of the movie, it would be hard not to cliché the dialog. There was one thing in this action film that really separated it from most acting movies. In most action films, the antagonist always loses because they talk to the protagonist and tell them their plan. In this film, there's not very much of that. The antagonist doesn't talk too much. I liked how an action film pulled that off.The action sequences in 'The Wolverine' were excellent. They mixed the right amount of emotion and intensity into the action scenes that balance out into very big fighting scenes that seem like they should mean something big to the film. There was one sequence that I thought got old and didn't really make sense at some points, but it was still good.The slow scenes after a big action sequences were done well. They were there to show the change in the characters, so they weren't that boring. Yes, they weren't incredibly entertaining, but they were still good. This film captures the emotions of you and puts them into the prolonging intensity of the situations at hand. This film has done this better than any other action film I've ever seen. There was also a very big twist at the end that I would've never guessed. It did get the smallest bit over the top, but it still worked very well.My only other problem with the film is that it seems like it ends several times.So, amazing battle scenes, great acting, very well done, very rich characters, good writing, it captures your emotions, and has good slow scenes, but has some unrealistic things, sometimes the acting and events of the movie get a bit over the top, and it seems like it ends several times. 'The Wolverine' is not perfect, but is excellent. I will definitely buy this movie on Blu-Ray and DVD when it comes out and highly recommend it to anything who is thinking about going to see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Well-Choreographed Martial Arts Film That Also Happens To Be About Wolverine...,"Hugh Jackman worked his *ss off for the role of Wolverine - most actors wouldn't change their lifestyle in a way that allowed them to have the body of a superhero. Rila Fukushima shines as a supporting actress - she looks plenty sexy in her fight scenes with that dyed red hair, wearing that skirt. Also, the location shooting in Japan (and primarily Australia) was a good decision. The movie is a little long - a little too long... but, I couldn't bring myself to deduct points for the excessive length. All around, The Wolverine (2013) is a solid installment of a superhero franchise that can stand alone as a well-choreographed action/martial arts film.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

"The characters, effects, and story were all beyond outstanding","The Wolverine continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. Welcome back Logan, now hand him back to Bryan Singer for the next X-Men film! The characters, effects, and story were all beyond outstanding in this movie. Like back in X2, we are taken for a ride and can relate to Logan once again. The acting is superb and the dialogue is perfect for the level of each character. Every single character feels believable. You follow the story through Logan's eyes and what a ride it turns out to be. It's better then everything not X2 (including First Class) in every single way that matters yet it's unique and is as far away from anything X-Men we've seen before. In this case, that's a very good thing. The FX and pace are superb. I honestly could see the FX being Oscar nominated here whereas the FX in Origins was TV show bad. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that was absent from Origins and every non-Marvel genre film of the past few years.This movie is sophisticated and delivers a grand story. The action fits in nice but serves the story first. Unlike other films that I've seen this summer, the supporting characters are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner. I loved Mariko! The other newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. Silver Samuari and the twist with him is remarkable. The cast selection is still perfect and I hope this spawns more Wolverine solo films but they left it as if this was the perfect end to Hugh's run.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Dark, gritty and better than the predecessor.","The most popular and favorite mutant, Wolverine comes back with his second solo film, The Wolverine. Played by Hugh Jackman again, it's his sixth time playing Logan. (which includes his five second badass cameo in X-Men: First Class)The movie is loosely based on the limited series Wolverine (1982) comic by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. The story begins after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand. Now, an unshaven and an unkempt Logan living in a forest away from the world, battles with himself after Jean Grey's (Famke Janssen) death. Troubled by her nightmares, he faces even more danger when he journey's to Tokyo to meet an old acquaintance, Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), the owner of a multi-million technology company with Yukio (Rila Fukushima), an expert swordsmen and who can foretell a person's death. As the story proceeds we find him for the first time vulnerable surrounded in a different city by the Yakuza and ninjas.In the first fifteen minutes, the unkempt Logan looks unfamiliar, but after a brief funny scene before his meeting with the dying Yashida, we find the Logan we know of. Compared to his last solo film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine which was average, The Wolverine comes out fresh and improved. It is now darker and brutal. Don't expect a light film like the previous X-Men movies. What makes the movie darker is Logan himself with his own haunted story to be mortal again and thereby wanting to join Jean in the afterlife. The fighting sequences are more brutal. And that's the best part of the movie. Watch out for the adrenaline rushing bullet train fighting sequence which is one of the best scenes in this two hour film. The makers have converted the 'typical train fighting sequence' into something completely new, thrilling and very fast paced like a bullet.There are far less mutants, only Wolverine and Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova). But that is what makes the movie what it is. Concentrating only on Logan's character, the soldier's efforts to save Mariko, the grand-daughter of Yashida (Tao Okamoto) the film proves to be dark, sometimes silent, and entertaining with a few laughs here and there. Viper is a good addition to the film with her slithering powers threatening the very existence of Logan.Overall, The Wolverine comes out as a good second solo movie. Although the movie does feel empty, fans will appreciate it and non-fans will be happy by Hugh Jackman's performance as a gritty and vulnerable mutant who is no more immortal. Don't forget to miss the exciting after credit scene which will make fans go gaga.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"He is Jacked, Man!","I liked this movie a lot. It was slick, intense, good action, good acting all around, well directed and one has to respect the decorum of Mr. Jackman. He was in amazing shape for this movie, his chest and abs were insane, and one has to respect that transformation. That's a lot of work physically, mentally and spiritually all around. I liked where the story went, I thought it was the best one out of the X-men series and the last Wolverine movie.You can never go wrong with Samurai's and pretty Asian women either who can kick some butt. James Mangold is a fantastic director and I can just imagine he was fighting the producers to keep that ending out of the movie, I won't say the ending, but it was an ending that took away from the movie and I can imagine Mr. Mangold was furious for having to keep it in there. Good movie all around though.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lukewarm and forgettable,"The first Wolverine film (2009) was much better than this one. It was simply more entertaining and ""cool"". This one is, quite frankly, boring and forgettable. The story-line leaves something to be desired. I was not satisfied with the script. That being said, the film wasn't horrible either. Personally, I just cannot find any concrete reasons for watching this, since the entertainment factor is just not there. Hugh Jackman is a good casting choice for the role of Wolverine and his acting is what saves this film from being a total bore. That and the female eye-candy, if you're into that sort of thing. All in all, I wouldn't recommend this flick to people who are not fans of the X-men universe. Those 2 hours it takes to watch this are better spent watching something else.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Light Years Ahead of its Predecessor,"I'd like to start this review by saying that I am not an X-men fan. I haven't seen the trilogy of X-men movies, nor have I seen any other X- men film except for X-Men Origins: Wolverine. I also haven't read any graphic novels associated with the X-men franchise. Having only seen Origins, I really had no desire to delve any deeper into the X-men franchise, but after seeing this film, that all changed.To put it simply, this film is so much better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine that it makes the movies almost incomparable. The Wolverine has a palatable story, engaging characters, and original and thoughtful action sequences, all of which were lacking in Origins.Everything that is good about The Wolverine can be traced back to one source; Hugh Jackman. He completely embodies the Wolverine character, conveying a man so tortured by his past that he is tormented by his very existence. A role like that needed to be aced, and Jackman does just that. As the film progresses towards its conclusion, his performance becomes ever-more impressive, and by the end of the film, it's completely impossible to see anyone else playing the role.In addition to Hugh Jackman, this film has some magnificently crafted action sequences to keep the entertainment level high. One scene in particular, which takes place on top of a speeding bullet train is a real thrill. This served as one of the film's more pleasant surprises, as all the summer's previous superhero movies suffered from repetitive and uninteresting fighting scenes (see Man of Steel and Iron Man 3).Beyond Jackman and some thoughtful action sequences, this film has its fair share of flaws. While initially the story is pretty good, with enough slow scenes to balance the action, some incredibly engaging expository scenes with the lead actors, and some real human emotion, there is certainly a big drop in quality towards the end. I don't want to spoil anything so that's all I'll say about that. As far as the supporting cast, I honestly had a real tough time believing some of them. In particular, Rila Fukushima stood out in a negative way; her introductory scene is so ridiculous that I was laughing out loud. She does get (much) better as the movie goes on, but she never reaches the level of the cast that surrounds her. In addition to Fukushima, Svetlana Khodchenkova is rather annoying as the lead villain. I suspect this is partially due to my lack of background knowledge concerning her character, but still, she really doesn't do anything to set her aside from the legions of boring generic comic book villains. The rest of the supporting cast didn't stand out in any way, with the exception of Tao Okamoto, who was quite good as Mariko.One thing I should add is that there is a scene after the credits that is well worth the wait. Having not seen previous X-men movies, I failed to grasp its meaning, but the gasps and general sounds of awe around the theater seemed to suggest it was pretty enjoyable.All in all, this film is a good movie. Like every movie, it has its flaws, and some of them are difficult to ignore, but there are enough fresh ideas here infused with Hugh Jackman's brand of raw energy to keep you more than entertained.RATING: 6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good personal tale,"I've been a fair fan of the series of the whole. Even the weaker installments I thoroughly enjoyed, so my review is already weighed in favor of this film. I will say even from a critics point of view I thought it was really well done. It's not the standard comic book faire, but more of an intrinsic study of the Wolverine character. He shows a lot of depth and vulnerability in this outing, far more than previous installments. It's a risky but necessary move to see him operate on a balance challenge where he really is prone to death at any moment. The humor is matched well with the drama for an interesting viewing all the way through. All the supporting roles I found interesting as well. I really enjoyed the presence of Yukio who provided invaluable aide despite Wolverine's incessant protests. I found it nice to see his character finally develop some closure after all the time we've get to see him in all his cinematic installments.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underwhelming Results,"Many people weren't impressed with X-Men Origins: Wolverine, mostly because comic book fans wanted Wolverine to get a grittier and less ridiculous take. The Wolverine tries to get all of that right. It builds a potential theme in the story and gives the hero a serious challenge. The problem is, it's not really compelling and instead of being actually ""dark"", it's once again relies on being extremely serious with little substance. The Wolverine has some bold choices of becoming a ""more than just an action blockbuster"" film, but it fails to justify what it should have been.The film puts some interesting choices for its story; what is it like to be mortal after living the rest of your life being indestructible? It's an interesting idea to transcend the material. There could be an intriguing look back, showing more humanity in this mutant. This isn't the first movie to have a hero losing his powers(well, healing powers). It has become a trend in superhero movies in a while, though this is actually one of the best things that has happened in the genre, but The Wolverine misses one important thing. Although this is supposed to be about Logan fighting his demons, the film didn't develop enough about the significance of his weakness other than trying to overcome his weird obsession for Jean Grey by having interests with another girl. Seems like the whole point of him being weak is to avoid lending his special power to the wrong hands, but through it all, we rarely see the character change in his heroic test.Apart from the thematic stuff, the film sends Wolverine in a new environment. We only see few mutants around and more ninjas and other ricier proportions. It can be gripping, otherwise less inspired. The action scenes aren't too inventive except the bullet train fight which is the only absurdity you'll see. At least the use of violence here is more than just an action fan pleasure, portraying the horrors of violence even in an interminable flesh. The performances are good enough. Hugh Jackman is still the Wolverine that we always loved.It's good that the franchise has become conscious about itself. The last Wolverine movie was nothing more than an extreme blockbuster pleasure without anything much inside. The Wolverine would have been powerful. It has a potentially good story that may top all the crazy action. Instead, it spends most of the runtime brooding at the less interesting life problems of Logan, but that's how his last journey ends, by the way. It's just would have been better if it's centrally about obsession of power or why some men seeks for immortality, and improving the hero's view on things after the challenge he faced. That's the opposite result of the film, leading to an emptier experience. No one's blaming the dark/gritty turn since it's a good idea coming from the fans, but the execution ends up underwhelming.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""This isn't going to end well!""","Says Jean Grey during one of her visits in Wolverine's nightmares and yet she is right. The Wolverine might have started in a good fashion but it is not a good movie by any means.First of all I have to say that I didn't want to see this movie in the cinema but I did because my friends wanted to go. I knew right form the first trailer that this won't be a good movie. This is one of the things when I'm not glad I'm right. I enjoyed all the previous X-men movies but the paradox is I loved most the X-men Movie which featured none of the cast from the previous movies and had a completely different director: X-Men: First Class.The Wolverine is the exact opposite of what the fans desired and the creators of this film promised. The fans were promised a take on the character that would be more faithful to the comics and and above all more violent. I guess we never get an R rated Wolverine or X-men movie which is a huge pity. I mean this is a character who has claws in his hands but actually never see any blood. We just hear the sound of his claws ripping through someone and the look of pain on his opponent. So we have to let the imagination roll. Wolverine is a brutal killing machine but with his heart in the right place. That's not the case in the movies. Here his portrayal seems to me as quite wimpy, and he gets wimpier and wimpier in every movie.Hugh Jackman is perfect fit for the role of Wolverine, which makes more sad that we probably never get a proper X-men or Wolverine movie with this actor. This movie doesn't move Wolverine's character arc anywhere. This is just a bridge between 2006's The Last Stand and next year's Days of the Future Past, which you also get teased in the mid credits scene, which might be one of the best scenes in the movie. The movie doesn't have a villain. I mean there is many figures who are the bad guys but it lacks a main villain. You know what they say, that the hero is just as good as the villain.The movie takes place in Japan however director James Mangold makes no use of the Japanese element. In fact it seems to me that is film is quite disgraceful to Japan and its culture when almost all the Japanese characters are portrayed as evil, greedy and hungry for wealth and power. The music is as generic as it can get with a summer blockbuster. No sign on of Japanese element in the music, which could have been very helpful.Don't waste your many on this piece of garbage and wait for the next year's Days of the Future Past which will once again an ensemble X-men movie. Looks like solo movies about one character from the X-men universe don't work.P.S. X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the previous solo X-men movie which got a lot of hate is much better and more fun film than this.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Superb In Every Way,"I've used this colloquialism before but ""X marks the spot"" and there are plenty of big action scenes throughout this amazing movie that it has to be called spectacular. Wolverine goes ballistic train in a good way and rivals the train sequence from Spider-Man 2. It's action with a nice mix of smarts and fun. I don't understand how anyone can complain about that awesome ending. After delivering adventure and a superb set up, they deliver action in just the right amount for the third act. For example, one of the few complaints about the first two Iron Man movies was that the pay off and third acts were lacking in action. No one can credibly say that with this film. What hits here is the best film of the summer in my mind.For the task of making a great stand alone film that could still be considered a sequel on some level that offered more then the first and was able to expand on the X-Men trilogy - it exceeds all expectations. The pace is better, the effects are better, the writing is superb, the additional characters were nicely patched in, Wolverine kicked backside, and overall this is one fine action film.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Solid, ferocious fun, ""The Wolverine"" is a well-made and exciting adventure for the titular hero, that runs laps around the underwhelming prior solo-film.","It's fairly interesting going back and watching the thus-far six entries in 20th Century Fox's ""X-Men"" film franchise. From a solid start with Bryan Singer's excellent first two films, through the plunge into mediocrity with Brett Ratner's shockingly underwhelming third entry and the subsequent (and almost equally as underwhelming) fourth entry, which also focused on a solo-adventure of ""Wolverine."" Then there was a glimmer of hope with the extremely strong and very well-made ""X-Men: First Class"", which redeemed the series in a big, bad way. It lived up to Singer's first two installments (which isn't surprising, as Singer was a producer and co-writer after his 2-film absence), and gave new hope for the series.And it is nice to see that this revitalization of the series continues in this newest entry, a solo-film for everyone's favorite clawed antihero- ""The Wolverine."" While it may not quite live up to ""First Classes"" first-class storytelling and direction, this entry in the franchise is still another step in the right direction, giving us a solid storyline, great visual direction, and a stronger depiction of the character than in his prior solo-effort.Hugh Jackman returns as Logan/Wolverine, some time after the death of his beloved Jean (Famke Janssen, who returns in several dream-like sequences) in ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" He now lives as a hermit in the Yukon, living off of the land and away from civilization as much as he can. However, he is soon located by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), and taken to Tokyo, Japan to meet with Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), whom he had saved from the Nagasaki nuclear blast in WWII. However, after a deadly series of events occurs, Yashida dies and Logan is forced to protect his granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto) from various forces, all while discovering that something, or someone, has somehow been able to suppress his healing capabilities, making him mortal and weak for the first time.The cast is great. Jackman is as (for lack of a better description) awesome as ever as good-old Wolverine, but he is also able to pull off some great dramatic moments as well. It's a great, compelling performance. Janssen is very decent in her small role, as a figment of Logan's imagination, reminding him of all he's lost. Rila Fukushima is a lot of fun as the mutant Yukio, as is Tao Okamoto as Mariko, whom Logan is sworn to protect. And Haruhiko Yamanouchi is very interesting in his limited role as Yashida. And all of the actors portraying secondary characters are equally solid as the lead cast.James Mangold's direction is top notch. I'm only familiar with some of his prior work (mainly in the excellent ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""Identity""), but here, he is able to adapt to the almost Sci-Fi tone and the rampant action with ease, conveying just the right tone and style to tell this story correctly. I also highly admired his fantastic visual choices, and choice in shot and composition. The direction was top-notch, for sure.Scott Frank and Mark Bomback's script is also a lot of fun. It's tightly paced, well-constructed, and gives just the right balance between action, development and even a little dark humor here and there. Although I will admit it is far from a perfect script. Some scenes are pure cheese (including, sadly, many of Janssen's scenes as Jean Gray), and the storyline itself is unfortunately nothing to write home about. It's a bit basic and cliché. And it really is what holds this film back from getting a higher score. It's not a bad script. But it's just not quite as good as it could have been.The rest of the production is very admirable, though. Costume and set design is fantastic. The visual effects are awe-inspiring and put the cheap-looking crap from Wolverine's last solo-film to shame. And the music by Marco Beltrami, while not one of his finest scores, is still a lot of fun, and it compliments the words and images on screen very well.This is thankfully another step forward for the ""X-Men"" film series. And it is thankfully (and finally) a film the likes of which Wolverine deserves. It may not be perfect, but it's fast, ferocious fun, and I think fans of the character will dig it.""The Wolverine"" gets a good 7 out of 10 from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I would like to say it lived up to my expectations,but i'm not sure that it did. There are a few massive plot holes but i don't worry about that too much when watching a movie based on a comic book.There are less memorable bits in this than origins, but the action sequences are big and bold and very well done. The touch of violence and humor goes well with the setting in Japan being serious and organised. The villains are a bit one dimensional but really, who cares?

Wolverine does not practice safe sex.,"Think about it. He suffers from chronic nightmares, awakens in a panic attack, and then gets all stabbity-stabbity towards whichever woman happens to be closest to his bed. We saw this in ""The X-Men"" (2000), but thankfully Rogue's plot convenient powers saved her. No mention is made of this to Mariko in ""The Wolverine"" (2013). Should he be  kinda sorta responsible for informing any women he spends the night with about his sleep disorder?Anyway,I didn't despise this movie the way so many others did, but my response was somewhat tepid for a lifelong fan of the character.I understand what the filmmakers were trying to do with ""The Wolverine"" – I really do. They were trying to make an X-Men movie with less flash and more substance. And it was a good plan – taking a ""gritty"" and clichéd dark character and humanizing him with a lot of introspective character study. Which should have been the ingredients for a great movie.This was an average film, though – I'd give it a 7 out of 10. For one, it was a bit slow and chatty at times for an ""X Men"" movie. For another, some of the action sequences and villains were just too cheesy. Silver Samurai reminded me constantly of the 1980's ""Voltron"" cartoon, and Viper was really just a poor man's Poison Ivy with unimpressive powers.This movie does do a really nice job in upgrading an old action movie trope – fighting on the roof of a moving train. That was fun.Can anyone explain to me how Wolverine got his claws back? How the hell did that happen?!Also  is he mortal now?

Ridiculously boring,"If you read the critics you would think that this Wolverine movie was better than the last; well they're wrong. I had high hopes after reading mostly positive reviews but after actually watching the movie I have to say that it was ridiculously boring. I am so tired of superhero movies that go from one fight scene to the next without any explanation, character or plot development. This movie suffered greatly from overkill with fighting. Also this movie suffers from confusing female characters. Mariko who we are suppose to like comes off as annoying. The Viper comes off as creepy. The only good female character is Yukio who steals the movie from wolverine every time they appear together. The plot was thin and any ending surprises projected themselves almost from the beginning of the movie. Poor Hugh Jackman, poor wolverine.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
GREAT FILM! This really is the Wolverine film we should have seen long ago.,"The Wolverine is a well-written film with superb performances all around. The script is admirable and develops the character in interesting ways, continuing and exploring themes from the X-Men films. Yet, you need not have seen even one of those films to enjoy this experience. And, this movie truly is an experience. It's thrilling and so very well constructed. Also, when it's time for action...Look out!The Wolverine deepens, darkens and expands upon the character beautifully. Logan is an outsider, has this tendency towards berserker rage, frequently regrets lashing out and is not able to find much peace in the world and now we know why. Being immortal hurts. The character journey and Japanese subtext is simply wonderful.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mixed bag,"The Wolverine was quite good until the final act. In that final act, it took on the characteristics of a Roger Moore variety Bond film. After a very suspenseful build-up, the climax got a little silly. Despite the silliness, the movie wasn't destroyed, just diminished.Advice to people who haven't been following X Men or Wolverine, familiarize yourself through some internet searching with the Wolverine's back story. It will help you figure things out in the movie's flashback scenes.Speaking of flashes, the atomic explosion (I won't say when or where) was a little underwhelming. It looked more like a hydrocarbon explosion that a nuclear pop. Its effects seemed muted and slow motion also.There was a dandy battle on top of a bullet train. Very exciting and well done. There were a lot of fight sequences that were well choreographed.The cast was good at their jobs. The dialog seemed muffled, but that may have been the theater in which I saw it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"W'hat they did to me, what I am, can't be undone.'","By now even non-Marvel comics devotees know the persona of The Wolverine, primarily because he has been recreated by actor Hugh Jackman six times (and if you pay attention to the film's ending it seems there will be more). Writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank have elected to place the action of this version in Japan – both in the time of the Atomic Bombing of Nagasaki and the present. Much of the reason this version works well is due to the fact that the action is all in the beauty of Japan of today – not only the scenery but also the symbols and traditions. Director James Mangold gives this version of Wolverine adventure a hefty dose of compassion and human feeling and that adds significantly.According to the short synopsis form 20th Century Fox, 'In modern day Japan, Wolverine is out of his depth in an unknown world as he faces his ultimate nemesis in a life-or-death battle that will leave him forever changed. Vulnerable for the first time and pushed to his physical and emotional limits, he confronts not only lethal samurai steel but also his inner struggle against his own immortality, emerging more powerful than we have ever seen him before.' That states it well. Add to that description the many fights and magic that occur before our eyes and the content is complete.Hugh Jackman is in buff form as a very tender Wolverine (Logan) this time around (flashbacks to his loss of his love, Famke Janssen, add spice). Others who make solid appearances include Tao Okamoto as the important Mariko, Rila Fukushima as Logan's sidekick, Svetlana Khochenkova as the evil Viper, Hiroyuki Sanada as a credible Shingen, and Ken Yamamura and Haruhiko Yamanouchi sharing the role of Yashida.A bit on the long side, the film provides the expected visual entertainment, and this time there is a bit more humanity infused as well.

Much better effort than Origins,"The Wolverine serves as a sequel to the critically panned X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Following the events of X-Men: The Last Stand, a distraught Wolverine retreats to the Canadian wilderness and leads an abject life of a wanderer. However, circumstances cause a drastic shift which places him in Tokyo, Japan. The story recounts Wolverine in unfamiliar territory, faced with precarious trials and tribulations.The aforementioned premise is based loosely on Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's iconic 1982 comic book run, which finally gets the cinematic treatment. James Mangold (Walk the Line) takes the helm as director and delivers a distinctive character study of the ruthless killing machine.In his sixth enactment of the fan favorite character, Hugh Jackman represents a fascinating embodiment of Wolverine. Mangold and Jackman exhibit a mutual comprehension of proceedings, excelling as a pair in delineating the vulnerable side of Wolverine. While all previous X-Men installments were ensemble driven, The Wolverine offers an alternate dynamic: a more methodical version, with character development aplenty. Once Wolverine is pushed to his physical and emotional threshold, he is compelled to confront his internal conflict. This gives viewers a chance to actually associate with the character on a more intimate level. Moreover, the isolation and agony felt by Wolverine is portrayed expertly as well.While Jackman is able to carry the movie entirely on his own, he is supported adequately and admirably by Tao Okamoto, who plays his love interest Mariko and Rila Fukushima as Yukio, who is Wolverine's aide. Both actresses share a good chemistry with Jackman. The interaction between Wolverine and Yukio leads to a few humorous moments, which are a welcome addition.The Wolverine represents a marked improvement compared to its predecessor. However, it is not without its own failings. First and foremost, the action sequences, which are the USP of such movies, are uninspiring. Apart from a sensational set piece atop a Japanese bullet train, the movies other altercations are monotonous and bland.Since the movie is shot primarily in Australia, with some studio sets serving as substitutes for the densely populated streets of Tokyo, the cinematographer is bound by such limitations. Therefore, the illuminated sights of Japan are rarely shown. Better comic book adaptations are known as much for their villains as the heroes and in this regard The Wolverine is bereft of an imperative element. The movie contains multiple threats for the protagonist, none of whom are a memorable adversary.Last but not least, the movie is prone to predictability and offers no suspense. The background score adds nothing while lackluster editing fails to do justice, especially to the action scenes as well. Also, the 3D presentation, perhaps merely a marketing gimmick by studios to earn extra revenue, does not have the desired effect. Lastly, The Wolverine also suffers from a generic and underwhelming climax.Despite the extent of errors, The Wolverine has the benefit of adjusted expectations, since it follows a widely derided prequel. The depiction of a more personal tale with lower stakes works in its favor. Nonetheless, the movie lacks the cutting edge and is tantamount to nothing more than acceptable fare.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Does the job,"Okay, so everyone likes Wolverine best out of the X-men, so it was no surprise that he got his own movie out of it. However, 'Origins' (as it was titled) wasn't as popular at the box office as the studio would have liked. Yet, due to the fact that it's Wolverine, who cares? So... let's give him another movie anyway.This time out steel-boned (or Adamantium, or whatever it's called) is in Japan, so expect plenty of fights with samurai. Next adventure he'll probably be in Norway, followed by a film set in Brazil, before finally ending up in Wales. Anyway, it doesn't really matter where he is... Hugh Jackman continues to do a decent enough portrayal as the titular character to make the movie worth sitting through. He fights, he growls, he fights a bit more. It's all good. However, this time the whole 'mutant aspect' which was so familiar in the X-men and Origins has been toned down a bit more.In this story (and I'm not 'spoiling' it for you as it's in the trailer) Wolverine loses his powers of rejuvenation and so needs to be a little more careful when taking on his enemies. Therefore you don't need to be a mutant (or have their 'mutant powers') to defeat him).So, if you like the X-Men, or just gritty action, you'll probably like this one. It's a solid entry into the franchise, but doesn't cover too much new ground.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sucked so horribly badly its not even funny,"After the first hour I wanted to walk out and every 5 min that past felt like an eternity, it was a snore fest. Zero action, horrible story, made no sense, no explanation of characters, no reason to care for them or about them or anything in the movie really, just a horrid disappoint all around. I have lost all faith in any future Wolverine movies.The story was predictable, easily. Wolverine was an idiot in the movie being taken down easily at times, with zero fight. There were so many stupid moments, so little explanation for what was happening, why it happened, why we should care, who was who. I wasn't expecting the best story, etc. I figured it would be worth watching for the action alone, but there was practically none, and nothing good that's for sure. No wonder they didn't show it in IMAX, it's not worth it. I would have rather watched Man of Steel again, or Pacific Rim again.I will never watch this movie again. I recommend you save the 2 hours of your life, because you will hate it. Anyone who says its good, is retarded.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Back to the basics,"James Mangold's The Wolverine finally gets the Marvel movies back to dork fandom level 11, which is good since they aren't taking DC's path of realism (besides that terrible Green Lantern) and trying to remain more in tune to the comics themselves. And if you're going to appeal to the real comic fans, you have to bring in some real obscure story lines. I'm not saying that The Wolverine plot is as classic as bringing Carnage to Manhattan, but just by getting Logan to Japan has to pump up any fat slob who still has all his comics in those terrible plastic sleeves and no clue when the first NFL game is this year. Simply put, if you don't get jazzed up hearing the words Silver Samurai, then this film is not for you.The basic story starts with Logan living in a cave and befriending bears, mostly from feeling guilty due to the loss of Jean Grey (stunning Famke Janseen), whom became The Phoenix in X-men 3 which was terrible, even though having the best storyline in comic book history since Batman kicked the hell out of the Predator twice (ed. note: that's up for debate). Soon the past catches up with Wolvie, as often does, and he's thrust in a mix of Japanese Yakuza and robotic monstrosities, all of which are after his magical healing power. There is so much more involved, but I've already caught hell from spoiling, so I really don't want to tell you that Logan dies and Cyclops is really Cable's father.As a movie, it's pretty elevated on the comic level, particularly compared to the latest Marvel blasphemy Iron Man 3, which had the greatest villain Iron Man ever faced becoming little more than a hackney actor (ironically played by one the greatest actors Ben Kingsley). The Wolverine does some alteration to the main characters involved, but leaves opportunity for a correction in breaking with the canon. However these are all characters that need to be brought into Logan's life, since around 400 issues of Wolverine involve Logan turning Japanese Vapor-style.Hugh Jackman, of course, does a fantastic job portraying our favorite Canucklehead. As much as I want to bash him due to everything he's done that doesn't involve claws, he really carries Logan's internal issues perfectly. Furthermore he looks like I imagine myself, if I didn't solely eat KFC double downs and consider urination to be exercise. As an added bonus there's a hint to Logan's claws actually being (spoiler), though I couldn't confirm that because some dork's cosplay was blocking my view for half the movie.I'm not going to go into the plot, but it's easy to follow and a lot of fun. Some great characters pop up, including Logan's love Mariko (the beautiful Tao Okamoto), assassin Yukio (the perfectly last name Rila Fukushima), and the vicious Viper (difficultly named Svetlana Khodchenkova), the latter of which was mainly tied to the enemy organization Hydra than a Japanese organization, though I could be wrong as I bailed halfway through reading her Marvel profile. There are more characters involved in the Wolverine canon but since none of them are associated with a team that starts with an X, who cares. Plus the Silver Samurai appears, though his storyline in the movie is different than that of the comic. That one aspect slightly sucked, but who knows where the character could morph into in the upcoming twenty follow-up films of the franchise.Overall The Wolverine was a fun film, and will satisfy some of the fandom that have been waiting for a director to somewhat read the comic before filming. It's not one hundred percent, but at least it's better than having Johnny Blaze and Nicholas Cage anywhere in the same sentence. Go see The Wolverine, and maybe they'll bring back more of the Weapon X that we all got teased on earlier.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Wolverine weak, old, and slow???","OK, so this Wolverine was better than the previous one, but that's not much of a compliment since the other one was just completely terrible.Rather than rehashing all of the reviews written, I only want to add the following: To me, in addition to what's already been said, they screwed up 2 very important things in both Wolverine movies...1. They don't make him bad ass enough. He's always getting his butt kicked left and right in both movies, and the Wolverine I know from the comics is unbeatable. I mean in the first Wolverine movie Sabretooth just completely manhandles him (wouldn't play out that way in the comics). In this second film, Logan keeps getting his butt handed to him by random dudes with guns that sneak up on him. The reason he has such a following is because he's a total ""bad ass"" and nobody ever gets the drop on him. The directors NEED TO SHOW WOLVERINE KICKING ASS MORE!!!! Sorry for yelling.2. His enhanced senses and reflexes are not emphasized at all. One of the things that makes him so hard to beat aside from his healing, and adamantium are his animal senses and reflexes. So he should be shown being more agile and alert than anyone else on screen.If you agree please sound off so studio types can hear about this for any future incarnations. We know someday there will be a reboot of the X-men franchise and therefore Wolverine as well. Let's make sure they do it right when they go back to the drawing board.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"I said, OK","It was fun to read how may people react to this movie. I could sat all day and read all of reviews and smile back. Some people really emotional, some others seem objective, others keep it decent. Well, ti's okay, as well as the movie, still okay.""The Wolverine"", not bad but also not really memorable. Like the classic movie, there are always the good, the bad, and the ugly.THE GOOD Well, I guess this is the first (I don't really count but I guess this is the biggest yet) box office superhero movie with mostly main location outside US. This is really some kind of refreshment. I mean, I live in Asia and when I was a child I though superhero only exist in US. But, this Wolverine beautifully choose Japan and tradition attached as main location and character which is bring new window that superhero can have a great action outside America.THE BAD I don't think that Logan sexual relationship with Mariko was important. Even feeling to her for me like forbidden fruit. He loved Jane and always will but she already gone, but it doesn't men that he must have to falling in love and made love with his former ""friend"" life-in-danger grand daughter. To keep her safe doesn't mean sex involved. That's a really lame connection.THE UGLY Absolutely the script. I know the screen writer had already taken much effort to balance this superhero movie to Japan tradition, but the worst part actually on it. There are some character's motive didn't really run well. For example, ""Viper"", there is no truly motive for her to help old man getting immortal life. Even character ""Yukio"" was completely garbage, and also Minister of Justice was dead character.The script also predictable. I guess everybody have been guessing about Shingen motive called him back to Japan after his lustful obsession to get immortal life. Well, faking death it's not really wise choice.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"James Logan, PI","It's like The Wolverine signed a contract with a network station for a prime time spin off, and then we got a preview of the first two episodes of James Logan, PI going around town solving mysteries. The first is called ""Wolverine and the Case of the Dead Bear,"" followed by ""Wolverine and the Case of the Silver Samurai."" Spoiler alert: he solves them both. And finally we can go home.Sitting through the movie, my unstimulated mind couldn't help but wander to another analogy. Think of this installment as a movement in a concerto, where the tempo is andante, moving so much more slowly than the rest of the pieces. As part of the X-franchise as a whole, it needed more action, less bland dialog, and honestly, just the thrill that we expected of watching a mass of superheroes and supervillains go at it with their superpowers.I get the attempt in a trend of making superheroes more grounded, but The Dark Night this film is not. Perhaps the only salvation is the bonus scene after the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Here's what went wrong.,"I've seen this movie because I love the cinematographic saga of X-Men, I've loved basically every chapter has ever been made. But this movie went against my usual taste for several reasons.I won't focus on the plot holes that have been widely pointed out (in almost every bad review) but I'm afraid they all have a point. This part is with no doubt one of the responsible for the bad achievements of the movie. Moreover, I think that one of the most interesting aspects of the X-Men saga was the orchestra of characters, which was the perfect expedient for plot-developing, personality building and even for the comic line. With the lack of every known X-Men here except for the Wolverine, it seems to me that we have lost the occasion for an interesting plot, for any analysis of Logan's character and for any comic line which is not lame.An error rather than a lost occasion.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brilliant movie!,"I think this Wolverine meets all the expectations of a Hollywood action packed movie. Stunning visuals and great fight scenes all throughout, coupled with a gripping story.Director James Mangold really managed to bring this comic book character and story to life, and Hugh Jackman was absolutely brilliant.In this film the Wolverine is verging on becoming mortal (as the trailer suggests, so this is NOT a spoiler) so Jackman is not the usual invincible superhero we're used to seeing.

Good action light on plot and just OK on filming quality (lots of shaky camera),"This is more of an action film than a in depth story film. I felt this was a weaker movie than I expected but still enjoyed it but maybe should have waited for the DVD.The movie had a amateurish shaky cam during fight scenes and scene cuts that will make you loose perspective of distance, time and some of the action. I believe if you are going to do a fight scene then you should film it and not ""fake it"" but shaking the camera and making lots of fast cuts, that is taking the easy way out and best left to home movies.The good of this movie is there is some more history of Wolverine past that helps build the Wolverine character for the next movie. Lots of action keeps the movie from getting boring.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So unnecessary and so disappointing ... yawn.,"Oh, yet another completely unnecessary sequel just for the sake of cashing in...There really is nothing more to tell about Logan. 'The Wolverine' follows the events of 'X-Men 3: The Last Stand', with Logan blaming himself for Jean Grey's death and trying to live with the guilt. Famke Janssen gladly accepted a paycheck to appear as visions only in this installment.So, the story starts in 1945 with the bombing of Nagasaki, and Logan saving a soldier, Yashida,'s life. Years later on his death bed, Yashida - now the owner of a successful business enterprise - summons Logan to Japan to ""say goodbye"". However, arriving there Logan realizes Yashida wants his power in order to stay immortal.The actual villain here, is Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) - or Viper Woman as they keep referring to her. I didn't find this character believable and she wasn't a nearly as good a villain as in the previous 'X-Men' films. Yashida's will states his granddaughter Mariko is to inherit his empire, thus people are after her to eliminate her, and - off course - Logan is there to protect her. Only problem is, he is losing his powers no thanks to Viper.This is a very slow moving film with little to none of the exciting visual effects we've become accustomed to in the franchise. There's more drama than action, and the action only comes in the form of kung fu fighting - and I'm so not a fan of kung fu! Hence I found the action sequences tedious and annoying to watch. By the way, that fighting sequence on top of the bullet train was absurd! That was pushing believability to the limit - even for a fantasy film. Oh, and how many near death moments must Logan have in one movie?? I mean, jeez, enough already!!Quite frankly, I became bored. At least beefy Hugh Jackman is still a feast for the eyes - and he is indeed looking mighty fine! Thankfully they find every excuse in the film to have him take his shirt off.

"GREAT FILM that delivers an austere, intense vibe!","Mangold has nailed the character and the action, and Hugh Jackman brought the character to the next level like he deserved to do. He is finally part of a Wolverine movie that truly showcases the true character and the true coolness of that character. The Wolverine has a more subdued tone than any of Logan's past screen appearances. They did reflect on the books as Logan is grim and silent throughout the entire first half of Act One. The austere, intense vibe of the piece is reminiscent of the solemnity of the 1980s Chris Claremont/Frank Miller comic book storyline upon which the film is based. It's not a direct adaptation of course but it's very true to that classic storyline and tone.What is it with great comic book movies and train scenes? Spider-Man 2 delivered an all-time comic book movie highlight and now The Wolverine may have done it one better! The entire movie is awesome but the train sequence may be the highlight of the year. Logan takes on a number of Yakuza inside a Japanese train car and, because of a plot turn, he's VERY vulnerable. With his life on the line, It's full on berserker rage that we all wanted to see! This is a perfectly realistic and wonderfully choreographed fight and the best gritty action in any X-realted film to date by far. They play with the claustrophobic space of the train car and that adds another unique element. When the action shifts to on top of the train car, it's as good if not better than what we saw in Spider-Man 2. I say better because the entire fight demands Logan use some thought in how he'll attack; it's not just slash, hack, slash. At super high speeds, it becomes a game of chess with the deadly Yakuza. As with the rest of the film, here the film delivers some excellent and fitting humor that never breaks the tension but is perfect and adds to the enjoyment. This is a terrific action scene and one terrific movie.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Couldn't be worse than X-Men Origins: Wolverine...right?,"The X-Men movies have been a roller coaster for fans of the source material. 2000's X-Men was a delight to see on the big screen, seeing our favorite band of heroes actually come together on screen for the first time. X-Men 2 topped that, becoming one of the finest comic related movies still to this day. Unfortunately, that's when X-Men: Last Stand came out.Helmed by a new director (Brett Ratner, infamous in Hollywood for his mediocrity), Last Stand basically flushed the X-Men legacy down the toilet. Armed with memes and the audacity to murder off prominent members of the X- Men lineup, the X-Men movies came to a halt.In '09, Wolverine had his first solo outing, X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It was, in a word, terrible.After seeing those two duds, I was not excited for X-Men: First Class, but went to see it anyway. It was surprisingly good, and brought life back to the X-crew. Finally, the series had a pulse. Now, in 2013, in anticipation of X-Men: Days of Future Past, comes The Wolverine.First, the cast. Hugh Jackman has never looked better as Logan. He worked hard to get in shape for this role (even employing help from The Rock), and it really showed. The rest of the supporting cast is sufficient, but does not stand out.The direction was sufficient by James Mangold. I can only dream about what may have been with Darren Arronofsky at the helm. He had worked on the film and script for 6 months, but wanted a much darker, rated R film, which the studio did not want. Shame. Could have been amazing, and much closer to the comics.Overall, I liked this movie, but I liked it to the point that I probably wouldn't watch it again. There was one scene that really stood out as being amazing - a fight along a bullet train that happens near the beginning of the story. It was simply breathtaking, and one of those scenes that will stand out for years to come. It's a shame it wasn't topped later on in the movie.I think that the problem with The Wolverine is that there was no great villain. The villains in the film, including one female mutant, are very one-dimensional and very, very uninteresting. From the trailers, you can see that we get the Silver Samurai, although he's nothing like he is in the comics. I hope that the next Wolverine outing comes with a dose of Omega Red, as I think a one on one Omega/Wolverine movie would be outstanding. If you look at the great comic book movies, they all have iconic, menacing, charismatic villains. The Dark Knight had Joker, the king of villains. Spider-Man 2 had Doc Oc. The Dark Knight Rises had Bane. This movie...had a few unmemorable villains. Shame, really.There were a few good scenes here and Jackman did a great job as Logan/Wolverine, but as an overall product, I didn't think it was great. It was better than Origins, however.PS: Be sure to stay after the credits, as (if you watched and remember the abomination known as X-Men: The Last Stand), there's quite a shocker that leads us into 2014's X-Men: Days of Future Past.Final Score: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not quite a home run, but still a good time with a great character.","Wolverine had a lot to make up for since Origins, but they chose a great part of the Wolverine's lineage to focus on for this movie.-Pros-The Wolverine follows one of the most popular story-arcs in Wolverine's history, and it holds up well. Logan lives in seclusion, and tries to deal with his demons after the death of Jean Grey, as well as the curse of immortality. He's tracked down and brought to Japan at the request of an old friend, which starts a chain of events that forces Logan to actually put his life on the line. The story is gripping, and the pace shifts from action-paced to deliberately slow very smoothly.Solid acting all around, but a special nod goes to Hugh Jackman. No one else will ever be able to play Logan...he's got that character locked up.The scenery, especially in Japan, is beautiful. And if you're a fan of Japanese culture, you'll find a lot to like in the settings.The action/fight scenes are very well done. Marvel flare mixed with some Samurai styling.-Cons-This movie is available in 3D just for the hell of it. Stick with 2D, you won't miss a thing.Comic readers, be warned...they make some creative changes to the story, especially with one character in particular. (One of my favorite characters in the Marvel universe too...ugh...)Although it's rated PG-13, Wolverine's pretty foul-mouthed...not really a con, as that's his character, but if you're a parent taking younger kids to this, take this as a heads-up.Overall, this movie is solid, and if you're a fan of Wolverine, you'll enjoy yourself. However, if you're a pure action movie fan, with no bias towards Marvel, and you HAVEN'T yet seen Pacific Rim...then your money is better spent on that.The Wolverine scores a 3.75 out of 5 on The BDBOS....I shouldn't have to say it, but remember that this is a Marvel movie...STAY FOR THE CREDITS!!!

The Wolverine adaptation that fans deserve,"The Wolverine gives us more reason to take X-Men films more seriously. First Class restored our faith while this one solidifies it as a serious force of filmmaking brilliance. Under the direction of James Mangold, this marks the best X-Men film since X2 and vastly superior to the terrible X-Men Origins. The Wolverine pits our anti-hero against 21st century samurai in Japan while discovering the limitations of his mutant curse. This film is an absolute blast from start to finish. Mangold takes what Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughn laid out and turns it into his own, thus creating a whole other level to be reached for the next X-Men film. The film is paced awesomely and the story is very engaging, something that has somewhat plagued X-Men films from X2 on. This film fixes the wrongs and despite some plot holes here and there, this film is wildly entertaining. The action sequences are brutal, how Wolverine was meant to be seen. One thing Mangold does here is push the envelope. For a PG-13 film, this as close to an R rating as you can get. Wolverine was always meant to be seen as a savage character and as far as an on screen savage is concerned, this film does it right and isn't afraid to shy away from a bit of blood. The tone here is a lot darker than the originals, it is not meant to glorify anything here. We view Wolverine's world as he does, bleak, cold and brutal. Overall, The Wolverine is a fun, smart, action packed thriller that doesn't let up until the end credits roll. If you liked the other X-Men films, you'll absolutely LOVE this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
OK now this was way better than Origins,"I was not very confident in this movie since X-men Origins sucked. But I was willing to give this movie a chance. And you know what, this is a very good well written character driven story.

There are a few character moments in this that really help understand Wolverine's character even more. which is what I thought origins would have done, but whatever.bottom line the story is great, the scenery in Japan is beautiful, there are some really top notch shots in this flick I really like how they captured everything. some of the action can be a bit cheesy, but its forgivable as the most of the movie is great.my only problems with it is that Poison Ivy...I mean Viper is so distractingly cartoonish, she didn't belong in this really dark story.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine's superb caliber makes up for its lack of witty dialogs and excellent script.,"Just like any other film I am a big fan of, I would have watched The Wolverine in its first opening day but due to conflicting schedule, I went on to watch it three days after it premiered in local cinemas.The Wolverine, also known as Wolverine 2, has no solid story arc to boast. I can't say the story is great: it is actually quite overused I felt like I have seen it in other movies. The conversations are very trivial, unlike its predecessors X-Men Origins and the X-Men films. Yet these aspects didn't prevent me from sitting until the end of the credits, because first of all, I am a big fan of Wolverine and the X- Men, which are among the few superhero characters I haven't outgrown yet and probably, will not. Second, the movie proved to be very entertaining in every manner. The visual effects, the fight scenes, and the cinematography are outstanding. The Wolverine's superb caliber makes up for its lack of witty dialogs and excellent script.Hugh Jackman demonstrated once more that he is indeed the only man who possesses the right to be Wolverine. The supporting Japanese characters added humor, drama, and thrill to the movie. Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova spiced up the movie with her maleficent character. Famke Janssen's small but pivotal role as Jean Grey added vulnerability to the Wolverine character and to the movie itself.

Fun Movie,"Wolverine is the 6th installment of X-men series with Hugh Jackman reviving his role as the title character. Loosely adapted from the famous Japanese arc by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, characters are more or less different from the original comics particularly Silver Samurai and Viper.Synopsis: Wolverine is shown living a secluded life, somewhere in northern America, over the guilt of killing Jean Grey (in The Last Stand). He is approached by a mysterious Japanese girl, Yukio, who wants to take him with her to Japan. As the plot unfolds, it's Yukio's boss Yashida who wants to meet Wolverine. Half a century back, Wolverine saved Yashida's life during Nagasaki nuclear tragedy. As a token of appreciation, Yashida wants to give Wolverine back his ""Mortality"" - a thing Wolverine craves most. However, Yashida dies unexpectedly and this sets into motion a chain of unexpected events involving her Grand-daughter Mariko (also his company's heir).Overall, the movie is darker than previous X-Men movies and appears more mature. GIven the original story-line was too big to be scaled down in a single movie, the script is quite decent. But it lacks the action we want from a X-men movie. Hugh Jackman as the central character gives an excellent performance. However,some parts of the movie needed more character development.Gorgeous Svetlana, as Viper, is shown as the main antagonist for most part of the movie. However, her lack of screen time leaves us unsatisfied. Changing the original comic story by making Viper a mutant is useless, if you don't want her to fight like one. Wolverine and Viper are not seen dueling much on screen and that's a bone of contention for me. Also, if Wolverine and Mariko were given more time together, their bond could have been explained better. Finally, I didn't like the finale as it wasn't as exciting as the Bullet Train fight sequence, or the funeral massacre.The Wolverine is a good installment for the X-men series raising the bar of X-men standard/theme. But it doesn't quite make it to the top of my list. X2 still remains my favorite, followed by First Class.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Serious, subdued and lacking in fun.","Taking place after the events of X-Men 3: The Last Stand, the regenerative beast's second solo outing (set in Japan, but largely shot in Sydney) deals almost exclusively in grief, guilt and seeking a means to an end. If that sounds a bit sombre and unblockbuster-y, then that's because it is. More of a samurai drama than a fantasy action pic, those seeking the usual X- Men tropes – such as huge, CGI-driven set pieces and colourful, mutated characters going at it hammer and tongs – will be very, very disappointed. The action is subdued and rather repetitive, with even the martial arts being somewhat lacklustre and uninventive despite arguably being the centrepiece of the film, whilst, in the movie's biggest flaw, the only other mutant to keep Wolvie company is an underwhelming hench(wo)man played by Russian model Svetlana Khodchenkova. The lack of other ""freaks"" on screen allows for a deep study into Wolverine's psyche through a patient, meditative story of redemption – which is a noble intention – but regrettably, it also saps the fun right out of proceedings, potentially alienating mainstream X-Men fans along the way. In his seventh appearance as the tormented soul with metal claws, Hugh Jackman has now reached a point where he simply is Wolverine and again attacks the role with the passion we've come to expect, although employing the superb Hiroyuki Sanada (Sunshine, The Last Samurai) in such a short and thankless part goes down as a missed opportunity. Not a bad film if you can shake off expectations based on previous entries into the franchise, but not one I can recommend either.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Solid movie, and Rila Fukushima is the best thing about it","This is a pretty solid adaptation of the classic 1982 Chris Claremont/Frank Miller comic miniseries that told Wolverine's first solo adventure outside of the X-Men books. At times James Mangold's direction feels uneven, and even drags in certain places. But overall it's an enjoyable ride.The best thing about the film, aside from Hugh Jackman's usual solid turn, is newcomer Rila Fukushima as the swordswoman Yukio. From what I've read, this is her first movie after a career as a fashion model. She's definitely got great screen presence, and she also has a really unique look. Look for her to give Rinko Kikuchi a run for her money as Hollywood's go-to ""Japanese female"" actress.The worst thing about the film is that it follows in the Hollywood tradition of all the pretty Asian ladies being threatened and oppressed by all the evil Asian men around them...until the brave, noble, handsome white guy comes to save the day while making all those pretty Asian ladies swoon. *Sigh* It's 2013!!! Yeah, I know. I myself pointed out that the movie is an adaptation of a story from the early 80's. It wouldn't be so bad if pretty much EVERY Hollywood film set in Asia didn't follow that same tired supremacist formula. And this movie doesn't exist in a vacuum.Still, for what it's worth, ""The Wolverine"" is an entertaining film. Compared to all the other summer movie offerings this year (2013), it's worth your money. If anything, see it for Rila Fukushima. She's great, and she's going to be a star.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Edge-of-your-seat metal-clangin' epic,"A standalone comic film adaptation is supposed to bring astonishing development to a superhero to establish a deeper understanding of its existence in its own universe.

Unlike the 2009 film ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", the new Wolverine film helmed by director James Mangold (3:10 To Yuma, Walk The Line) grabs the opportunity to deliver an even anarchistic Wolverine and a fitting to the X-Men universe.The narrative is entirely focused on the Frank Miller and Chris Clairmont comic issues, which is set in Japan. Logan as the Wolverine, embarks on his way to Tokyo accompanied by Yukio (Rila Fukushima) to bid adieu to a Japanese WW II veteran back in 1945 during the Nagasaki Bombing, Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi). The dying Yashida, who presently owns a tech company, wants to pay Logan a price for saving him from the atomic bombing. Yashida wants him to be mortal by transferring his own healing factor, but Logan refuses.The film takes off after Yashida's death and a sinister event involving one of the mutant physicians who turned out to be the Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) who plants an anti-Adamantium substance-like to Logan reducing his healing ability. A group of Yakuzas captures Mariko (Tao Okamoto), the granddaughter of Yashida. Logan must see to it that Mariko is not in the wrong hands.""The Wolverine"" is a slam-bang CGI-induced movie unlike the passable ""Man of Steel"" which is packed with bloated CGI wallop and less humor. With Japan as the setting, the Wolverine character's given an anarchic feel and out-of-this-world dire ramification of being out of his powers and learning of his own as an outsider. The action packs a punch, especially if we arrive at the bullet train scene at the speed of light. And of course, one of the rivalries of mutants, the ninjas gives helping in providing real clash for Wolverine.The only thing I'm disappointed would be the overuse of CGI in some obvious fragments of the film. If you've seen the trailer, you know whom am I referring to.Among the superhero films of 2013, ""The Wolverine"" is one of the best. At least the Wolverine this time knows how to make a difference and proves that he's one of the badass superheroes of this generation. ""The Wolverine"" is an edge-of-your-seat metal-clanging new offering which never fails.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is the Wolverine we all love.,"Okay let's get it out of the way. X-Men Origins: Wolverine was a train wreck. It took one of Marvel's biggest and best heroes and turned his face value down a few notches. This is not the case with The Wolverine. This was the movie that the character deserved from day one.Has any actor ever fit their respective superhero role better than Hugh Jackman as Wolverine? Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man maybe, but even more than him, Jackman has been solidified as the only actor that could ever play the mutant bad ass. This movie finally shows off Jackman in full, giving him nearly 100 percent of the screen time and letting Jackman let loose in arguably his best performance as Logan/Wolverine yet. I wish Hugh Jackman could stay young forever to play Wolverine for eternity, and this movie shows why he will forever be the greatest Wolverine.The story is, to say the least, a major upgrade from Origins. Wolverine is shown as a man who's gone rouge and is requested to travel to Japan to visit an old friend. Eventually, Logan becomes engaged in a mission to protect Mariko Yashida, the grand daughter of Logan's old friend. Logan runs into some awesome action scenes where the total brute force of Wolverine is unleashed. The story also sees Logan battling with his inner demons, and the occasional cameo from his deceased love interest Jean Grey shows that Logan is contemplating death to reunite with his lost love. It is a different side of Wolverine that we haven't seen before and the movie benefits from it. The Viper ends up making an appearance as a side villain, and eventually the movie concludes with a satisfying final battle scene. The story of the movie was engaging and exciting, giving Wolverine the story he needed 4 years ago.The Wolverine wouldn't be anything without action, and there is lots of it. Hugh Jackman's ageless body comes out swinging hard, right from the first time he pops his claws out and you get that awesome sensation that it's about to go down. The action scenes are fun and varied, the highlight being a battle on a super-speed train that sees Wolverine use his smarts, as well as revealing something different from the hero. Without going into to deep of spoilers, Logan is eventually faced with his healing ability being stripped from him, making for a much deeper character than just a bash and claw guy. However, this doesn't stop Logan from doing what he does best, kicking total ass. All in all, the action is splendid. Even a few major clichéd one liners are delivered that in probably any other movie would be criticized, but for Wolverine, they were awesome.This is what I wanted from my Wolverine movie 4 years ago. A movie solely focused on the title character, that showed him mowing baddies down while providing me with an interesting story that kept me interested the whole time. Some of Wolverine's best stories have come from his adventures in Japan, and I'm glad that writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank, along with director James Mangold, used Japan as the setting for this movie.Hugh Jackman is the Wolverine. No other actor could fit the role better, and for all of the films and the 13 years Jackman as put into the character, it's extremely rewarding to see him in the movie that everyone wants. The Wolverine is a total blast, and stick around for an after-credits scene that had me jumping out of my seat for joy as it sets the stage for the next X-Men movie.8.5/10 (added my own 0.5)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A fine entry for X-Men series,"'The Wolverine' has improved a lot better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' but there is still something missing from it. Undeniably X-Men franchise couldn't stand for spin-off film, this would make it more like an ordinary superhero movie and not X-Men franchise, just 2 mutants appear in this movie: Wolverine and Viper, also the peak action scene isn't special. Fortunately, all of the actor here acts acceptably although most of them are Japanese and not well known at Hollywood industry. Some action sequences are still stunning though especially the scene when Wolverine fights on fast train. Overall 'The Wolverine' is still fun as summer entertainment. James Mangold as director has been brave to shot and bring Wolverine story at Japan which rarely happens in blockbuster movie. But it's too shame this movie lost in slow plot, repeatable and overlong storyline that sometimes make audience feels bored. And don't leave theater early because it has additional scene after end credit.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not the Best but Watchable,"This was not as good as I thought it could be. The story was way too slow for your typical comic movie. I feel that the movie will not appeal to younger audiences as they will loose interest early in the movie. I biggest problem with the movie in my opinion was the lack of adventure compared to other movies involving Wolverine. There also wasn't very much comic relief that is usually in these movies. I felt it was more of a love story than an action movie. There are not very many mutants in the movie. A real downer, in my opinion. Many of the big stuff that were in this story I felt were not good for the storyline. There aren't very many mutants, and the ones there are weren't very important to the story. If you do go see the movie stay around for the credits there is stuff to see during the credits. I just felt the writing did not live up to other movies with Wolverine. This story had a good idea poorly executed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wolverine / Logan goes solo for the 2nd time,"The man with the adamantium skeleton is back. No ""X-Men"" word in the title, just his name, Wolverine AKA Logan goes solo for the second time after X-Men Origins: Wolverine (Hood, 2009). The comic story arc of Wolverine in Japan is well known among X-Men-philes. So expect to see Katana wielding samurai and ninjas.The prologue shows Logan being held captive by the Japanese troops in Nagasaki during WW2. The American B-52 bomber was coming to drop the A-Bomb, he saved Yashida's life, a Japanese soldier. Switching back to current time, we see Logan had nightmares about his former lover Jean Grey (Famkee Janssen returned, remind me of the creepy Leonardo Di Caprio character's wife in Nolan's Inception). The remorse Logan is haunted by his past, the guilt consumes him in many ways. He went for secluded life in the wild, this is where the plot picks up after the event in X-Men: The Last Stand (Ratner, 2006).This fish-out-of-water plot shows how Logan is called upon to bid farewell to his long time friend, a dying old man Yashida, who he saved half a century ago. Yashida is grateful for Logan's deed and wants to repay him by offering something that everyone has, except him: Mortality. The so called mortality curse possessed by Logan has already been made clear in the previous X-Men Origins movie. The idea of wiping off the Wolverine's memory is essentially the same as ending his life. Things get knotty when Yashida's grand daughter, Mariko is hunted by Yakuza gangs, this is where Wolverine cross swords (or cross swords with claws for that matter) with his opponents.If there is one movie the bankable star Hugh Jackman guarantee to carry a movie on his own, it is the portrayal of the resentful feral mutant which makes him always watchable. From the three X-men movies, to the spin-off X-Men Origins: Wolverine, down to the eye catching cameo appearance in prequel X-Men: First Class. Having said that, in this latest chapter, the lack of memorable supporting casts and the decent script let him down big time. Logan's supposedly love interest, Mariko, besides he saves her from suicide and escape with her during the funeral scene, where is their sudden mutual affection coming from? Pure bad writing, period. Then there is the red-haired Yukio, bodyguard (do not ask me why) of Logan, who serves little purpose in the movie.I will not be the minority who think Logan fighting with the gun-trotting Yakuza members is not as exciting as fighting with another equally matched mutants, is it? The lack of worthy villains soften the intensity factor. The blonde who played the forked tongue mutant, who I reckon her special ability is ..... spreading disease (?) and superhuman strength (?), hardly a third tier X-Men character in special power hierarchy. Are we suppose to believe she can challenge Wolverine's superiority? Then there is this finale's villain (the name I should remain a secret) disinterested me by the time the plot got to there.The funeral set piece is one of the highlights and the prologue is the best scene in the entire movie, it just went down hill afterwards. The plot does not bring anything new to the table, aside from he is in a culturally different territory and temporary loses the self-healing power. I yawned as much as Wolverine's adamantium claws pop out from his fists throughout the movie. As far as a X-Men theme movie goes, I am surprise by the bland effort.My movie review at www.sowyau.blogspot.com/",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine is one of the most thrilling movies of this summer!,"Just watched this latest Wolverine movie with my movie theatre-working friend. How awesome was this! Logan (Hugh Jackman, as always) is in Japan, supposedly to say goodbye to an old friend he saved in Nagasaki during the atomic blast, but he once again ends up helping some of his family members like his granddaughter. There's also another who is sort of his guardian. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a thrilling trip in the Land of the Rising Sun especially when it takes us to the top of a moving train. There's also some nice quiet scenes between the granddaughter and Logan. This was quite a thrill to watch especially in 3-D. So on that note, I highly recommend The Wolverine!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Definite Improvement Over Its Predecessor But Still No Match To The Finest X-Men Films,"Although a definite improvement over the repugnant spin-off that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine, James Mangold's The Wolverine does work as a standalone sequel but it is still no match to the finest entries of the original & rebooted X-Men series. While it does try to paint a different portrait of Logan, focusing more on the man than his indestructible abilities, it ultimately lacks the x-factor that turns a good story great.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine has more substance just as Hugh Jackman has more muscles here,"¨What they did to me, what I am, can't be undone.¨It seems that adding the ¨The¨to the title nowadays makes every movie look a bit cooler and it actually works for this film because The Wolverine is much better than its predecessor, X-Men Origins - Wolverine. Logan was one of my favorite characters in the X-Men trilogy and it was a shame the origin story didn't work too well because he is such an interesting character and there are so many places you could go with it. Director James Mangold (who has a favorable track record with me: Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma) succeeds here by taking Logan to Japan, which many fans of the comics may agree is one of their personal favorite moments (Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's 1982 run). Having the events of this film take place after The Last Stand also allowed Mangold to have more space to work with and focus on Logan's inner demons as he deals with the loss of Jean Grey. Fans won't be disappointed because the character is carefully developed here and unlike its predecessor the action scenes work to build the story and not the other way around where you have the typical superhero movie that jumps from one action scene to the next without any apparent purpose. The action scenes are also beautifully choreographed here (I am specially thinking of that train sequence). Another thing that worked for me is that you don't have Logan trying to save the world; the entire plot takes place almost entirely in Japan. It is a small scale film unlike recent superhero films where everything takes place around the globe while entire cities are being blown to pieces. And finally the film has a great scene after the credits that connect things nicely to the next X-Men film coming out next year. The Wolverine is a solid film and one of the better superhero films of the year.The film takes place around two years after the events of The Last Stand. Logan (Hugh Jackman) is living on his own in the Yukon constantly having nightmares about Jean (Famke Janssen). He has been living as a nomad in the woods conflicted with the fact that he has lost so many dear loved ones. One day while having a small dispute with some hunters at a near town he encounters Yukio (Rila Fukushima) a Japanese red haired woman who has come to persuade him to come to Japan to say goodbye to her master, Yashida (Ken Yamamura), who is dying from cancer. Logan saved Yashida's life 70 years ago during WWII in Nagasaki and now he wants to say goodbye to him. Logan decides to travel to Japan to say his farewell, but once he is there Yashida presents him with a unique opportunity: he claims his company has the technological advances to make him mortal again. He knows eternity has been a curse for him, and offers him the opportunity of becoming mortal, but Logan refuses the offer. He then asks Logan to stay for a couple of days and protect his granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), who he believes is in danger. That night Logan awakens to find that Yashida has passed away. During the funeral some yakuza try to attack Mariko, but Logan saves her. For the first time in his life Logan doesn't seem to recover from his injuries, but that doesn't prevent him from protecting Mariko from the people that are after her. The Wolverine now must learn how to face an unknown enemy while at the same time deal with his immortality.Hugh Jackman looked better than ever as Wolverine (this is the fifth time he repeats the role). He owns the character in probably the same way that Robert Downey Jr. owns Iron Man and is physically in better shape than in his previous films. The film also seems to have more depth and substance as the character is better developed here. It also has what a superhero film must have which are thrilling action scenes, but there is much more to this film. The story is dark and isn't as fast paced, but it is satisfying. My only complaint has to do with the final act which is a little too cartoonish and generic, but it doesn't hurt the overall effectiveness of the film. I really had a fun time with this film and it has me hooked with how they are going to tie things up with the next film of the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could have been thoughtful but the genre demands silliness.,"Much of the film is an interesting take on Logan as a character. The first third of it especially is a character driven drama of a man of undying regrets. Unfortunately, the expectation of the genre-larger than life characters, mumbo-jumbo fantasia-force the film into silly scenarios repeatedly. The final reveal is laugh out loud funny and the actions scenes are too operatic. The final film is engaging but it could have been so much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A good Marvel adaptation, though","Well, it's a good movie - if You're up for a two-hour sci-fi/action Marvel adaptation that is full with ninjas, katanas, a robot samurai, some X-Man mutants with their bad-ass quotes. It is also a good Wolverine sequel and don't falls behind it's predecessors. Not that good as Iron man or Avengers, but You got to watch excellent computer generated effects, a lot of action and nice Japanese scenery. Like all Marvel comic adaptations, the scenes have originality and are more creative than most of the today's Hollywood action movies (that I am mostly disappointed with).

I Laughed. Unfortunately They Were Not At The Intended Humor. ♦ 43%,"The plot is dumb, all right. Bringing up a made-up story just so you could make another Wolverine movie to generate triple the amount you spend is the latest trend in Hollywood. But, if you are an X-Men follower there are two things you may wanna watch out, once it comes out in rentals: the thing they do with Logan & the post-credit scene.Starting off with a bearded Hugh Jackman, the plot takes you back to the Nagasaki bombing. We know he is immortal; lands up in Japan and gets entangled in a series of ridiculous action sequences, I suspect, which were voluntarily. Then, we have few Japanese women he befriends and manages to go beyond, which makes no sense at all for a character so harsh & bold. The climax is a cheap attempt at a twist which hardly works for the movie. Other characters were poorly directed and the scene they acted in gave me an impression of unfathomable continuity. The villainy lacks vindictiveness. Trust me, the 2 hours of monotony just leads to you-know-what!And there is not much of the visual effects to write about. Action sequences are very good, but come on, now we require something inventive and spine-chilling. Probably the worst installment.BOTTOM LINE: Not recommended if you are conscious about your wallet. Wait for the DVD if you are a collector. 4.3/10!Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Best Adventure Film Of The Year,"This is a wonderful film on every level. I honestly prefer my summer films to have substance and be more than just ""mindless popcorn entertainment"". To me, a movie achieves excellence when judging them by these things: If the film was able to capture the heart of the story while fleshing out complete characters that are challenged by meaningful obstacles. If the use of CGI and effects were wisely chosen and used to further the plot itself. If the movie used its own ideas and is well structured. If an adventure film truly thrills and delivers intrigue. And finally, if the actors, cinematographers, and producers were able to flow with the director's vision and deliver using their own particular craft.That being said, The Wolverine works on all those levels.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good action but lots of plot-holes...,"There's so many plot-holes in this movie, it's just silly... I can't go into it without spoiling the story, but I'll just say that I counted 5+ plot-holes, and even one that goes directly against the film ""Logan (2017)"".In films like these (superhero films), canon is extremely important. You can spoil the canon of an entire franchise with a single poorly made film and then all future films are ruined.They also gave Yukio non-canonical superpowers in the film, which is the equivalent of giving The Hulk the ability to turn into a butterfly... it just makes no sense. It goes to show that the writers/director of the film don't care about the subject matter or canon of the film.It's also quite shocking that they spent $130million to make this film... the movie has remarkably little CGI, and yet it cost an insane amount to make... how the movie cost that much to make, and yet have so little to show for it, we'll never know.Overall, it's a poor showing, especially when compared to fantastic Marvel movies like Deadpool or Thor Ragnarok.

"Decent, unexceptional, kind of falls apart at the end","The Wolverine is a generally competent comic book movie. In the comic-book movie landscape overall, that's not a bad thing, but as an offshoot of the X-Men series, which is arguably the best of the comic-book movie series, it's rather disappointing.The movie begins pretty well, with Logan, traumatized by the events of The Last Stand, hiding out in the forest having dreams about Jean and his time at Nagasaki, he gets into a fight, meets a young, hot woman with a way with a sword, and winds up in Japan fighting the Yakuza and meeting more young hot women.The fight scenes are fairly entertaining, overall (there's a pretty good one on top of a bullet train), and Logan is given a handicap that makes things tougher for him, which is a nice touch.The writing tends to laziness, particularly at the end, which includes non-sequiturs like one character changing her appearance for no apparent reason other than someone decided it would look cool (eh) and a twist that probably surprised no one.The acting is mixed, although Jackman is good as always.It's all perfectly watchable and completely forgettable.

The hero. The fugitive. The warrior. The survivor. The legend.,"The last stand-alone Wolverine film we got was X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and that film was not that good, which lots of X-Men fans can agree on, so I am still looking forward to there being a good Wolverine film because Hugh Jackman is great in the role and I want his character done right; the only thing I knew about this 2013 film was that it takes place after the film X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), which was another reason why I was interested in seeing this. The film The Wolverine (2013) was great with good performances, fun action, not that much CGI, an investing story, a cool serious tone, skillful use of Japan related mythology, and the setting in Tokyo with the uses of Yakuza and Samurai is cool seeing; this whole movie is a great personal journey about Logan becoming Wolverine again, which made the film investing to watch, but also there were some minor issues I found that involves the antagonists and a tone change near the end.Once again Hugh Jackman is excellent in the role of Logan, with him having nightmares whenever he sleeps and him trying to get over being the cause of Jean Grey's death, but also, I did love his journey to become Wolverine again because he is just called Logan at the start of the film; having him get hurt for real added takes and suspense to certain scenes, and I like how he wants to become mortal but is thinking if he does want that or not, along with protecting this girl who has the potential in being a powerful person. At first, I was not sure about the character Yukio played well by Rila Fukushima, but as the film went on, I started to like her more and she became a cool character with her being cool in certain fight scenes; I also liked the dynamic between her and Logan when they are working together to protect this girl Mariko and fight back against these Yakuza. Lastly, the girl named Mariko played well by Tao Okamoto was not bad of a character, at first you might think she is just a love interest, but she has potential to be a powerful person in her family and she does do quite a bit to show she can handle herself from time to time depending on the situation.The twist of sorts that involves the reveal of the main villain was a bit obvious once certain clues start going around, but I will just say that you could see it coming by the third act climax, along with there being another villain named Viper who did not work that well with the serious tone of the film that much because of how she would act and use her abilities which made her look silly; also, I will just say that I liked the film until the last twenty minutes, though it was still well directed and was entertaining, it did get a bit silly because of certain things that are revealed and portrayed. The action sequences were fun and cool to watch, with them being bloody enough for a PG-13 rating making it great seeing Logan slash through people, along with there not being that many uses of CGI except for the nice looking adamantium claws and the third act climax; the personal journey Logan takes to become Wolverine was awesome to see with having lots of cool moments proving why Hugh Jackman is perfect in the role and is just like the character in comics.The film The Wolverine (2013) was great with good performances, fun action, not that much CGI, an investing story, a cool serious tone, skillful use of Japan related mythology, and the setting in Tokyo with the uses of Yakuza and Samurai is cool seeing; this whole movie is a great personal journey about Logan becoming Wolverine again, which made the film investing to watch, but also there were some minor issues I found that involves the antagonists and a tone change near the end, but other than that the film gave me what I wanted from a stand-alone Wolverine film. Wolverine fans, X-Men fans, and casual moviegoers will have a fun time with this movie because it gives comic book fans what they want to see from this character, and they will give normal moviegoers an entertaining and fun film to watch; this was better than the last stand-alone film, and I recommend giving this a watch if you have not already.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Enjoyed this movie.  Don't understand it's poor reviews.,"Really enjoyed this movie. It is what it is and anyone who thinks they want to watch it because they are a fan of Wolverine or other Marvel Comics characters are going to be sated.What I don't get are the poorly rated reviews. This thing delivered everything I had hoped for in this movie. And more. I'm not a big Marvel comic book fan. I'm more of a DC fan myself, but I've grown to love the Marvel Comics movies and they always... or almost always, deliver what I'm hoping for. Excitement, and all manor of drama without getting into the intimate sex lives of the characters but still delivering some of the angst of these characters past.Like I said, I don't get the poor reviews.

I place a lot of my leverage toward my viewing decisions based on these reviews.Possible spoiler... I'll offer real fans this... Wolverine is faced with challenges he's never faced... including his mortality. That alone intrigued me. But the complex character interaction pleased me.

And then movie starts to tumble, where the yakuza,the Ninjas, Samurais and what not are thrown in like a garnishing on a typical Indian Masala movie.

The Wolverine is a great return to the older X-Men films we fell in love with (X-Men and X-Men 2) and begins connecting the dots for X-Men: Days of Future Past.,"I had very low expectations walking into the theater with my daughter to watch The Wolverine. After X-Men The Last Stand and X-Men Origins: Wolverine I was expecting an action film that left me longing for a great X-Men film. My reservations toward the Wolverine are completely valid after they killed my dreams of Deadpool on film. I'm happy to say, the Wolverine didn't let me down.The action within the film is good and you see Wolverine moving how you expect him to move and acting like the character we love from the Marvel comics and the story was really good and made sense within the X-Men universe. The characters felt worked out and believable throughout most of the film.The only character I wasn't very happy with was Svetlana Khodchenkova acting ability as Viper. Every line she spoke felt fake and forced. The sense you get from her in the film is simply ""I'm pretty, I'm sexy, I can say words and you'll love me."" That attempt in acting didn't connect her to the rest of the cast or with the audience.Luckily, Hugh Jackson saves the film from Svetlana's bad acting. He displayed a very complex and intense side of the Wolverine that we have seen glimpses of within in the other X-Men films but really came out within the full length of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Wolverine, a Clawed Samurai in a Kimono","Right from the start, you think Wolverine landing in Japan is going to be all about slicing up yakuza with his claws in a samurai vibe.

Japanese culture is front and center, from the scenery to the katanas slicing through the air - visually, it's impressive.From the get-go, you settle into your seat, ready to watch Logan tear everything apart. The opening is super stylish with a fight scene on a train that takes you from munching popcorn to almost having a heart attack. But then, all of a sudden, the movie starts to drag, like you're watching an episode of Naruto with too many flashbacks and not enough shurikens. The pace vanishes, and you start to get bored. A real shame, because you can feel like it's about to get awesome any moment.What's cool about this one is we finally see Logan struggling, like, really weakened. Usually, the guy takes bullets and blade strikes like they're candy, but here he's having a hard time, sweating it out, and it's refreshing. You almost want to hand him a Tylenol to help him out. But then he gets back on track, and boom, the beast is back. We see his wild side again, even though he's not in peak claw-slashing form. Too bad it's not a tad more violent!Now, the villains... they're not exactly Japan's finest. Between a samurai who looks like a knockoff Iron Man and a viper who makes you want to change the channel, you quickly realize Wolverine deserves better. We're far from iconic villains here. The threat is present, but it's bland, like sushi without soy sauce.Thankfully, the movie picks up in the final act. The climactic fight is pretty solid, though you'd want more blood and claws flying around. This is when Wolverine shows he's still the boss, but it's a case of too little, too late. You leave the movie thinking it could've been so much more intense.The Wolverine is fun, it gets the job done, but it could've been a lot more punchy. Hugh Jackman remains excellent, staying true to the character with his humor and ripped muscles, but the story lacks bite, and the pacing is all over the place. In short, it's a good watch for Logan fans, but we're still waiting for him to truly unleash hell.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""This isn't going to end well. Everyone you love dies.""","FILM: 7.5
Rewatching The Wolverine, I find myself appreciating it more than ever. Director James Mangold takes the helm and steers Wolverine towards more serious and competent territory, making for a gripping experience. The film focuses on a loose adaptation of the fan-favourite Japan storyline from the standalone Wolverine comic book, which I find refreshing and engaging.The film successfully shrugs off the lows of the 2009 installment, allowing Hugh Jackman to deliver his most nuanced and ferocious performance yet. Jackman truly embodies the character, bringing a depth and intensity that keeps me thoroughly invested in his journey. Mangold's pacing is superb, balancing quieter, character-driven moments with bursts of creative action that keep the narrative flowing smoothly.The action sequences in The Wolverine are particularly inventive and well-executed. From the exhilarating train fight to the intimate hand-to-hand combat scenes, I am constantly impressed by the variety and creativity on display. The film's exploration of Logan's vulnerability and struggle with his immortality adds new layers to the character.However, the film can't help itself and succumbs somewhat to a ""big bad"" showdown that feels a little out of place. This climax, while entertaining, slightly undermines the more grounded and personal tone established earlier. Despite this, the ship has been righted, and The Wolverine manages to find its footing, delivering a satisfying and substantial entry in the X-Men saga.The film's setting in Japan adds a unique cultural backdrop that distinguishes it from other superhero films. The Japanese cast, including standout performances by Rila Fukushima, Tao Okamoto and the perpetually rock solid Hiroyuki Sanada, enrich the story and provide a fresh dynamic. The film's visual style and atmosphere also benefit from this setting, creating a captivating and visually appealing experience.Overall, The Wolverine is a solid and engaging film that successfully revitalises the character. While not without its flaws, it's a marked improvement over its predecessor and offers a compelling and well-crafted story. For me, it's a testament to the enduring appeal of Wolverine.FORMAT: Blu-ray 3DVIDEO: 9.0

The Wolverine 2013 Review,"Whoever decided we need a modern-day japan setting for a Wolverine movie deserves a raise.
Hugh Jackman, as always, is amazing as Wolverine, and his performance in this film in particular is really really good. But that's nothing new.
Stunts, choreography, and fight scenes are really impressive here, I especially loved the fight with Shingen.
Shingen, along with all the other supporting actors / actresses are all pretty good and actually made me care about them in the end unlike First Class and The Last Stand. But where that falls off is The Viper, who in the end just annoyed me every time she appeared on screen. And I don't think the (no spoilers) robot really bothered me as much as most people, but it still ruined the vibe of the film a little.
Overall pretty damn solid. Definitely my favorite Wolverine movie thus far, but we'll see if that changes with Logan.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The best at doing what Wolverine is - and that *is* very nice,"With the X-Men disbanded(no, this doesn't retcon The Last Stand or Origins) and Jean gone(albeit she does appear in this - I won't give away how, but it's perfect for dealing with this part of the aftermath of the previous entries; and Janssen does brilliantly), Logan(Jackman, nailing the role again, hard-drinking and brooding without making it dull - and in the best shape yet) is about to give up. He won't use violence(except for how brutal and bloody this is for being PG-13...), and he's facing inner demons, and the curse of immortality. What good is it to live forever, when those you love die horribly? Yashida(Yamanouchi/Yamamura, given a major arc, and bringing up the further themes of integrity and honor), the dying leader of a huge corporation who he saved at Nagasaki(...!), offers him a chance to die naturally. His granddaughter, Mariko(Okamoto, arguably the lesser of the all-strong female-dominated supporting, all Japanese, cast, who still holds her own) is targeted, and Wolverine protects her.When you add her mysterious, acrobatic childhood friend Harada(Yun Lee), her abusive father Shingen(Sanada) who both do well in their performances, the pixie-like short badass Yukio(Fukushima, who steals the whole movie - I demand a trilogy devoted to her) who recruits our hero, and the cold doctor Viper(Khodchenkova, who gives the sole poor performance - given that this is about the only English title on her filmography, maybe it's a language barrier thing?) who there may just be something more to, it might sound like this makes the usual mistake of far too many people. I am happy to report that nothing could be further from the truth. The character relationships in this are compelling, dialog well-written, and everything holds up to scrutiny(in fact, this does a tremendous job with subtle setup and payoff) until the third act where all of that and the plot implodes, as we patiently sit through a tedious climax-in-placement-only of a fight.As this might tell you, this is a stand-alone. While not ignoring continuity, it is far more about giving us a gripping portrayal of our protagonist. Every so often, a standard Summer blockbuster comic book flick will claw its way to the surface. Yes, this does lead to a feeling of genre schizophrenia, and this certainly isn't without its flaws - some of them substantial - still, the inspired elements make it well worth your attention, even if they don't all gel. That is, if you're already a fan. If the berserker rage and Adamantium doesn't already get you going, this one will not change anything. This is a great place to start, if you haven't checked these out so far - it's self-contained and explains everything you need to know well, without spoiling anything it doesn't need to about the others. The action is well-choreographed, and at its best, gets the mano-a-mano, high physicality and intensity that Mangold went for - at its worst, the go-to of shaky-cam makes it hard to follow. There is an appropriate amount of it and none of it goes on for too long.As an adaptation of the beloved Claremont/Miller mini, this doesn't stray excessively, or stay chokingly close(*cough*Watchmen*cough*). The 3D is barely noticeable - not only a post-conversion. I'd go for 2D; as long as you do go. FX are convincing, save for one early thing, and this doesn't disappear into a heap of CGI - the martial arts are clearly real, stunts and practical work heightening the credibility in a thoroughly realistic world - that does have some superpowers. This makes it fit with the Singer two-logy - further enabling this to wash out the bad taste the earlier attempt at a solo outing. The 115 minute running time before the credits that you should stay through(at least to the midway point) passes by smoothly. I wasn't always at the edge of my seat, but I was nearly always engaged.There is a lot of disturbing content and a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of these - graphic novels and motion pictures alike. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine Title Everyone Was Waiting For?,"The X Men series has always been an OK one for me. They weren't bad movies, but there were so many better outlets out there. However, I am kind of excited for what they're going to do for Days of the Future Past, and apparently this is a setup to it? It's not, it's a story on its own and for the most part it has some strong moments to it. Hugh Jackman gives a great performance as always, and it has a decent supporting cast. This takes place after the awful X 3 the Last Stand, so it's best to read up on this or major spoilers! For a PG-13 movie it's shockingly violent. It does make for some great action, but still the amount is pretty severe for an X Men movie. It goes all out at the very end, but that's when it goes all cartoonish on us. It is such a change in tone from the gritty first two acts. I actually liked the grit, he was going through some horrible emotional stuff and they do not sugar coat it. However, Hugh Jackman's performance is worth the watch and the action is excellent, go if you feel like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
No Bueno,The visuals were good. I saw this in 3D. I read the comics but the main problem of this movie was the was the characters just flipped flopped back and forth from good to bad. The story was not well thought out and there were slow parts in the movie that let you think about the problems of the story. Wolverine is suppose to be a bad ass but for what ever reason he keeps getting his butt kicked all the way through. I recommend you wait until it comes out on TV. This looks like another attempt by Marvel to do a half fast job with story telling. One last thing they keep putting in Jean Grey to talk to Logan. I know Logan has been through a lot but when you start having conversations with dead people you may need to check yourself into a psych ward.,5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mortality,"Re-watching all of Hugh Jackman's performances as Wolverine has reminded me of a few things. The most notable being that no matter the quality of the film he's in, Jackman has always given it his all. He's put his body through vigorous training and eating routines so that the fans of the franchise have the Wolverine they've always wanted.The Wolverine isn't a perfect solo outing for the clawed mutant. But it's 100% better than X-Men Origins Wolverine from quite a few years back. This adventure takes Logan/Wolverine to Japan to say goodbye to a dying old friend, Yashida, he saved from the atomic bomb in Nagasaki during World War II. Only, that friend has a little bit more planned than initially lead on. Yashida would like to transfer Logan's healing ability to his own body in order to stay alive and in turn, give Logan the ""mortality he's always wanted"".This idea of mortality as it relates to Logan is a fascinating one, but it's not explored enough to justify an entire plot built around it. Even with his hallucinations of lying in bed with the deceased Jean Grey or walking around like a caveman don't necessarily sell me on his death wish. It feels more like the idea of mortality is forced into his subconscious rather than brought on naturally. Hopefully, 'Logan' tackles this theme in a more interesting way.The other problem with this story is that it ventures deep into a family drama with the centerpiece being Yashida's apparent death. With the exception of a few scenes, it has the tendency to not feel like Logan's story at all. Instead, it's more like a modern-day western where Logan is forced to protect strangers for the greater good, ala Clint Eastwood in 'Pale Rider'. The Wolverine is like Iron Man 3 in that, the movie is fine by itself but it doesn't succeed entirely in being a comic-book adaptation. I understand that this was inspired by a specific run of comics, but the final product sure didn't feel all that worthy.But there are plenty of positives. Jackman's performance goes without saying. It's impeccable. The action, and particularly hand to hand claw/sword battles are tremendous. Dare I say some of the best action the X-Men franchise has seen to date. The sequence on the bullet train is exceptional. But overall, the action and performances only even out the glaring weaknesses. The ending is a letdown and the inclusion of Viper feels completely out of place. Hopefully 'Logan' gives the titular character a bit more of his own story.+Action+Jackman gets bigger and better every time-Viper-Not really Logan's story-Ending7.1/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"not bad, the legit Japanese actors are a plus","Of course, better than wolverine origins but not quite at the level of singer x-men, the film was entertaining, brooding, and surprisingly just a little haunting. Scenes with the wolverine taking on yakuza on a bullet train as well as ninjas on a snowy night are fun but the film shines the most when logan is emotionally vulnerable...and when it plays out the person of yukio (rila fukushima), a supporting role but probably one of the most interesting characters in the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine,"This second stand alone Wolverine film is a lot better than the first, in my opinion, and with Marvel Studios going full pelt into their universe, what with the recent 'Iron Man 3', 'Avengers, and the upcoming 'Thor 2: The Dark World' and recently announced 'Avengers 2', Fox have had to up their game a bit with their 'X-Men' movies to compete with the similar properties, and it does show, if a little rough around the edges.The story is better too and tells of Logan's struggle with his immortality, as well as the love story between him and Mariko (Tao Okamoto). I did think that the villains in 'The Wolverine' were a bit meh, throwaway type villains if you will. Not really fleshed out enough, although that was maybe mainly due to the plot being about more of the suits behind corporations than say an evil force to subdue. That said, if you add in the few decent fight sequences; the funeral, on top of a speeding bullet train and of course the climactic fight at the end, plus the deep Japanese culture and lush scenery throughout, it's a decent enough effort into the X-Men mythos. Entertaining, but maybe not quite on par with the Marvel/Disney efforts, but almost there.And a word of warning, you've just GOT to stay after the end credits, as it seems to set up things to come. It's worth it, believe me!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The best Wolverine film,"I rented this movie from my local library and while I was a little skeptical (considering X-Men Origins: Wolverine, which I hadn't seen but I heard was bad), it didn't disappoint. We get more Wolverine action while he travels through Japan, plus lots of Yakuza fighting and beautiful scenery in the land of the rising sun. We even got the Silver Samurai. The nearly all-Japanese cast didn't hurt either. And considering I'm interested in Japanese culture, especially their pop culture, this really delivered. It sure outdid X3 and gave Wolverine his own movie in an exotic land. I don't remember a lot but I did enjoy this. It's probably good for a single viewing. Maybe two if you're big on Wolverine. But I was satisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine delivers,"The last movie staring Wolverine was awful. So imagine my surprise when I heard they were making a sequel. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to not only be a great film, but the best superhero film of the summer. Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine in this sequel to the member of the X- Men's first solo outing. Mark Bomback and The Usual Suspects' Christopher McQuarrie penned the script, which takes its inspiration from the Chris Claremont/Frank Miller Marvel miniseries from the 1980s dealing with the character's adventures in Japan as he fights ninjas in the ceremonial garb of the samurai. Knight and Day's James Mangold directs. (Jeremy Wheeler, Rovi) The Story here is overall pretty good, despite a few plot holes it is well told, and it is delivered in a stylish and cool way. It is more than just a straightforward action film, The Wolverine is the study of Logan. The study of a man who has lived for over a century, who hasn't aged at all while he has watched those he has loved wither away and die, and a man who has killed the one person he loves most. The script is really well done, a surprise considering the biggest problem with X-Men Origins was indeed the script. The dialogue is quirky, funny, and natural. The acting here is top notch. Everyone here gives good performances, but the star of the movie is Hugh Jackman, who proves he is still THE WOLVERINE, he gives what is easily the best performance of his career. The action, despite some shaky cam that annoyed me, is great. There is a fight scene on a moving bullet train that is easily the best action sequence in the X-Men film series' history. The Wolverine is a great surprise. It is well acted, well directed, beautifully shot, and is easily the best superhero movie of the summer. And take my advice: STAY AFTER THE CREDITS. There is something there that easily made me give the movie points, and while I won't spoil what it is, I can say this: X-Men Days Of Future Past can't come soon enough.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
We've been there before,"This is Hollywood's second attempt to create a movie solely based on the character of Wolverine. (If you don't count the 3 X-Men movies).Jokes aside, this movie came of pretty disappointing. We've related to Wolverine before. We tried to follow his story, We felt his fears, tasted his determination, and felt his rage. It was my opinion that the X-Men movies and origins accomplished this pretty well.Now why did they make another one of those? You could just say Hollywood milking of a franchise or a concept, but it seems to be further than that. We do not need to explore this character any further. Been there, done that. We need a real X-Men story, with more characters, different mutants and more complicated plots.The character was portrayed pretty well, but it went as far as it could go.Oh and if you haven't seen this movie yet, it does get entertaining for a while, but it turns into real schlock in the end. Be warned.Overall, well made movie, but poorly written, un-reletable, dull and uninventive. If you want some decent action, go see it. For anything more, I wouldn't bother. But hey, I'm just some guy on the internet...",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretend Origins was never made!,"I want to start off by saying that read my title and trust me look at origins as never having been made. The Wolverine is a Xmen movie i can feel good about again because quite frankly ever since X2 and ""maybe"" Last Stand (yes i like last stand) all xmen movies were very shall i say slow and boring. Origins was by far worse then First Class but First Class i still felt was rather slow paced and kinda bland acting for the most part. Now that we have Wolverine i feel like the films can get back on track with what made Xmen and X2 so much fun to begin with.Of course there are some points in the movie i found somewhat ""cliche"" but still Wolverine is definitely Marvel's answer to the Dark Knight where its a movie about dark times and superb acting not just blowing stuff up.So even if your not an Xmen fan you still should look at this movie as pure summer fun with a brain not dumb summer fun with bad acting and no plot",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
They are all so old!,"I liked the movie, even after being spoiled by the trailer which revealed way too much of the plot. A rather typical hero saves girl story instead of a true superhero movie. OK, Logan is invincible and there are some other mutants involved, but most of all it is an action movie about a guy protecting a chick. I also understood where the character came from. What I would call reckless idiocy in any other movie is a typical Wolverine behavior. I also liked the Japanese angle, although too little of their culture was shown and it was too stereotyped.What I noticed most in the film, however, is how old everybody is. Famke Janssen appears as a memory of Jean Grey, you know her - really beautiful - but she got old. Hugh Jackman is full of muscle and manly frowns, but when he needs to run he also needs camera tricks to hide the clumsiness of an old guy running around. And at the end (you have to wait until after the first credits) you get a little scene with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan hinting that the third Wolverine (or X-Men, or whatever) will be about Sentinels. Both those guys looked ancient. Of course, in order to compensate the oldies, sexy young women were used. And as usual, when in need of a stunningly beautiful female villain, always use a Russian girl. Svetlana Khodchenkova's Viper was a pretty nasty villain; I would have wanted to see more of her.All in all, a fun film, without being overly sci-fi or X-Men related. It seemed a little bit low budget for a movie of this genre, though. Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece and you'll probably enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Waste of money!,"Two is probably one star too many, but that's for the effort Hugh Jackman put into a weak, disjointed, ludicrous plot. The camera work on the fight scenes were obviously an effort by the director to promote the efforts of a normal 3-year-old...although either of my girls were better at that age than whomever they let do the filming. Be nice if film makers would stop having their idiot camera men run down the street, jump over objects and crawl over broken glass when they were filming action scenes. They totally suck. As for the plot, everyone is trying to kill the girl Wolverine decides to protect. However, any one could have killed her at any time during the drug out, unbelievable fights...which Wolverine seems unable to win. Good thing they didn't use X-Men in the title. They would certainly be facing a lawsuit by every other respectable X-Man.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Painfully Pointless,"Painfully pointless, this film fails to add anything to the story of the Wolverine. While X:Men Origins was average, The Wolverine is ridiculously dumb. The plot was predictable, the romance was mindless and the motivations were shallow. Looking back at the X-Men franchise, this is probably the film that I am least likely to re-watch. There are few redeemable qualities, mostly in the action department. While I love seeing Hugh Jackman's Wolverine on the big screen, some times it is better to end on top.There were a few memorable moments but unfortunately, this film is a disappointment compared to the others.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Cliché princess in a castle plot, awkward acting, horrible plot and lines","Cliché princess in a castle (literally, except it's a Japanese one), and awkward acting by the two female Japanese actors.The princess in a castle plot was so blatantly obvious that it would have been better to just rub it in the viewer's face. I mean, really. They could have done better than just the lone knight moving determinedly towards the castle; not to mention that the Wolverine calls Mariko ""princess"".The movie is also a stereotypical picture of Japan and its men and women. We get it that the Japanese have their sword-in-your-own-gut suicides and the women are all stereotypical obedient housewives who actually can turn into screaming ninjas and kill you with a sword. WE GET IT. Enough of these people obsessing over their historical culture and ENOUGH WITH THE NINJAS. ENOUGH WITH THE NINJAS PLEASE. Every country in the world had professional assassins that covered themselves in black to sneak in and kill people. EVERY COUNTRY HAD ASSASSINS DRESSED IN BLACK. Why can't we just call them assassins? or spies? Great Britain has the MI6, with their spies dressed in black suits. Are we gonna start calling them ninjas too? The Japanese government is trying to claim that anything and everything came from their island. They claim that their neighboring countries' land is theirs as well the sea and stuff from other countries. They could very well claim that the British got their ideas of James Bond from them. They did it to China and Korea's islands and archaeological finds. Please do not let them copyright men wearing black tights as ""ninjas"". I prefer not to create any more words than necessary. We already have the word ""assassin"".I thought the so-called ""love hotels"" were a bit exaggerated, but it turns out it wasn't so. Japan has tons of them in cities - and YES, with those hilarious themed rooms. It was funny until I found out it was real; then it just became weird. I mean sex and making out is already perfect on its own without having to do it in a room with fake moon- rocks and a space shuttle theme. We get that Japan has its own thing going on, and it's nothing special; we all have that weird kid in class who like to guzzle ketchup or sniff glue. THEY are that kid. We just have to wait until they grow out of it - which they are starting to - and turn into sensible global citizens. I just don't need it to be shoved in my face, like how I don't like it when people guzzle ketchup in front of me.Moving on to the acting. I thought the male Japanese actors did well, some of the antagonists acted brilliantly! The female Japanese actors, on the other hand, were HORRIBLE. They acted natural when they spoke Japanese, but when they did their lines in English, it was REALLY AWKWARD. I had to squirm in my seat to avoid looking at the screen because their awkward lines made ME awkward. Can't they have used Japanese-American actors? Maybe the director was aiming for authenticity in their accents, but what he hit was failure. After seeing the Japanese female actor in ""Pacific Rim"", I thought I would never see more awkward acting than her - but they did it. Congratulations.Overall, I would give the movie a 3/10. The only reason I give the three stars is because the male actors in the movie did good acting; the awkward lines and acting from the female Japanese acting was what took out three stars, the cliché plot took out the four.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A fun to watch movie, nothing more","I really like the wolverine as a character and Hugh Jackman once again plays his role perfectly. The problem was that he was the only interesting character in this movie.Unlike the first wolverine movie where there were many interesting characters like his brother, Victor Creed, this movie had none except for the wolverine himself. Moreover, no other character really had a big role or had true influence on the movie which made it a bit dull unlike the first movie where there were Victor and Stryker, each with a lot of influence. Another problem in this movie is that it is supposed to be a ""Mutant"" based movie but there weren't really enough mutants, only Logan, Viper and Yukio. This fact also made the movie dull because it turned more into a ""One special person"" (Wolverine) against a lot of normal people who act more like ""Iron Man 2"" super villains than X-Men Villains.On the other hand, there were a lot of action scenes that were very fun to watch and very well edited and the movie had a lot of funny ""Wolverine personality"" moments reminding me of his scene in ""X-Men: First Class"".All in all, it was a fun to watch movie but not a lot more than that and one can only hope that another one will be made in the hopes of getting more out of the mutants and wolverine in particular.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"If it bleeds, we can kill it","This is better than the last go around, but not without a truck load of missed opportunities to do something much better than this.The Wolverine took me to a nice return trip to Japan without the bad airline food and turbulence sitting in coach for 14 hours, but I wished they would have had more for me to do when I got there. Rila Fukushima was a master stroke in casting but damn near wasted with lots of useless dialog and Tao Okamoto doesn't really have much to do. But along with Pacific Rim's Rinko Kikuchi, I'm glad these great actresses from Nihon are getting the play they deserve. It would be nice if they had more to do than pull upright chop sticks from the soba. Like the actors, rich Japanese references were all tossed as background noise and not put to much use in what is essentially a chase movie.Even with the Jean Grey angle, there was a better story in here someplace. Essentially, the filmmakers hinted at it but never pursued better ideas in any seriousness. The themes in The Wolverine lead to many interesting questions which would have made a more powerful movie. ""How does one kill one who cannot die?"" or ""Is immortality actually another form of death?""It would have been nice to see a Marvel movie actually try and develop a character for once instead of two more hours of Hulk-Smash scenes. Oh yeah and the Viper villain was just trash. She fell out of Power Rangers or something. Totally out of tone with the rest of the movie.Yes, it could have all been better.

Okay but not groundbreaking,"This film has a mixture of good/cool but there were some boring dips. Several scenes appeared very costly (like the train scene) and this was actually done well, a lot of cool angles and shots happen. I thought the train scene was one of the most memorable parts of the movie and the trailer. I felt as though there could have been more of an exciting plot and maybe even more Wolverine action going on - it was almost like the interesting parts of the film were scattered and I felt as though some scenes could have been removed to make way for a much better flow of what was working.The ending was well worth watching after the credits. This evidently leads on from the X-Men Trilogy - and very unexpected. After seeing this scene you can't help but feel like it is a money/marketing strategy more than, therefore the film has no final closure as such and typically intrigues the viewer to seeing the sequels.It's not a bad movie, but not the best release this year.

Great Adaptation,"For those wondering why this movie has such a low rating, it could be due to the fact that tons of reviews are a 3 out of 10 based on facts the reviewers missed when watching the movie. Tons and tons of reviews complain about plot holes, when said plot holes were addressed in the movie themselves and weren't really holes at all. So don't take the low rating to heart.This movie has some amazing action and acting. You get to see the character of Logan lost and adrift, start to learn about what it means to exist in a world where all those around him are mortal and will die. The scenery is great, the acting is great and the story follows pretty well the comic to the screen. Are their differences, yes, quite a few. So if you are one of those types that can't appreciate the two mediums for being different and having to portray stories differently, then don't watch this movie.Overall this movie has a great story that keeps you engrossed in the movie. You quite often can feel the anguish and loneliness that Logan feels. You also get to see The Wolverine as the lead, as the loner and as the bad ass he really is. You see him fight with who he really is and what he wishes he could be. For a comic movie, the story is much deeper than usual and makes for a great watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

They belong in the Marvel universe.This would have been a great Wolverine movie but PG-13 rating kills lot of it. All the fights just become meaningless and too clean. Come on, here is an beast of a fighter with huge claws ripping people apart. Yes, Wolverine is a very violent character but this movie doesn't show it. Shame really. If they make a 3rd Wolvie solo movie, please please, add blood. You won't lose money.Things I liked about the film:1. Hugh Jackman owns Wolverines character physically. 2. Mariko looks amazing 3. Film has funny moments and humor but not over the top. Kinda like the comics. 4. Ninjas! Ninjas make anything better.*SNIKT*",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good start but messy ending,"This really did start off promisingly. The WW2 beginning followed by Logan's time I. The wilderness was engaging. His trip to Tokyo was cool, especially if you know your Wolverine comic history. I genuinely thought the funeral scene was a really good action set piece. One of the best I have seen in any superhero movie. Wolvie running through the streets of Tokyo being chased by Yakuza was great. Some of the ninja stuff was cool as were a few of the new characters especially Yuriko. I just thought the whole Silver Samurai ness at the end ruined it. Anyone who reads the comics knows what I mean. The movie made him out to be some giant clunky robot... definitely not cool. It just really ruined a decent movie and turned into a CGI mess.

"For those unread in the source material, stay away...","Oh my, where to begin...Okay so first I am aware that prior experience with the source material is conducive to increased enjoyment of this movie. I have only seen the X-men movies and have not read the comics, so this review will be given from a purely objective perspective of the movie.The movie is not smart, but rather the exact opposite. You can't even try to figure out the goings-ons because they literally chuck it at you like a baseball at every plot turn. But that's expected for a 'standard' superhero action flick, right? So I won't go on about that. As for the action, I found it to be rather unfulfilling. There weren't an excessive amount of fight scenes as I had hoped, and virtually no gore other than in the scenes where it shows Wolverine's injuries. The fights were not imaginative when Wolverine was involved as he just hacked and slashed, but I have to give props for some of the Katana choreography which was very well done in my opinion. The action was not realistic, of course, but it was literally just not believable; the 'goons' with semi-automatic pistols only fired 1 bullet at close range, and just decided to stand there while they got cut down by an already slow and weakened Wolverine. With a bit more creative effort, fight choreography could easily make the fight scenes more believable.And if you just intended to give this a look-see for the action, boy I wish you good luck when you go through all the filler 'romance' that happens in the middle and the cringe-worthy banter between Logan and the red haired bodyguard. The dialog is abhorrent. I wouldn't be at all surprised if a fanfic writer in the 11th grade spent 5 minutes writing whatever came to his mind for the dialog between Jackman and most of the other characters. It's somewhere along the lines of the awkward small talk you have when you bump into someone you're barely familiar with at the grocery store. I did not find any of the banter even somewhat humorous, minus maybe 2 parts in the whole film; it did not meet the standards of the most basic Hollywood humor. Mangold also tried to develop a romance in the middle of the movie which takes about 30 minutes to pass. It's appallingly trite, made worse by the fabricated Asian bad-English accent of Mariko.Jackman's acting was... on point. He made it work with the script he had, and so did the other characters. The father of Mariko in my opinion delivered his lines the best - he really sounded convincing whenever he spoke. Ms. Khodchenkova on the other hand did try to give a candid performance, but to no avail due to the pedestrian dialog she was given.The movie gets some points for cinematography and camera-work, which was done moderately well. All the shots were clear, well paced, and presented the action well especially during faster scenes such as the katana fights.Overall, I did not have a good experience with this movie. I did not enjoy it, but my father and my little sister apparently did. You may or may not enjoy the action, but just keep in mind that there is not enough to overshadow the unbearable altercations and silly plot directions that take up more than half of the screen time.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine: The Trailer That Said it All,"http://filmthroughmyeyes.blogspot.com/INTRO:Another movie from the storied Marvel franchise staring their most iconic X-Men member James ""Logan"" Howlett a.k.a. Wolverine. This time around the directorship of the film was passed to James Mangold who was the director of one of my favorite movies 3:10 to Yuma. Hugh Jackman stars as Wolverine as usual. These three factors (Marvel's Wolverine, Hugh Jackman, and James Mangold) should constitute a fantastic movie. This particular film is an adaptation from the 1982 comic book series of the same name. The film originally began in 2009 with Darren Aronofsky (director of Black Swan and The Wrestler) as the director, but was delayed due to a variety of things including the earthquake and tsunamis in Japan. In 2011, James Mangold took over for Aronofsky.PLOT: If you watched the trailer for this movie, you could have guessed the entirety of the plot. Nothing in this movie would have surprised you at all except for the mars themed room that Logan and Mariko rent at a sex hotel on their way to Nagasaki. The trailer showed wolverine meeting Yashida, not being able to heal as fast, fighting Viper, fighting a giant silver samurai, and talking with Yashida about removing Logan's immortality. That is the entirety of the movie. The fight scene on the train was even shown in the freaking trailer.ACTING:Hugh Jackman is his typical Wolverine character. His muscles are big, his beard full, and his Australian accent nonexistent. He plays Wolverine well as he has in all of the X-Men movies, so I won't belabor any analysis of his performance.The leading ladies of the film, Markio and Yukio, are played by actresses with very limited previous movie experience. Both of them deliver adequate performances and fill their characters well.Overall, the acting was fine in the movie. Viper's actress Svetlana Khodchenkova (Russian much?) plays the over the top psychotic villain. Her character very much reminded me of Poison Ivy from the Batman world and the 1997 movie Batman & Robin which had one of the most star studded casts of any super hero movie.TAKEAWAYS:Save yourself two hours and watch the 2 minute trailer to understand the entirety of this movie. The character's actions have zero motivation behind them. How this movie moved through the script is beyond me. How hard can it possibly be to make a good Wolverine movie? His character is so solid. He has mental issues that as a director you could dive into and make Batman-like. There are also a lot of really cool villains in the X-Men universe to play opposite the Wolverine. Bottom line: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.RATING:The film gets 0/5 Chuck Norris thumbs ups.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Impressive action scenes in the latest X-Men series offering,"WHEN a South African makes it big in Hollywood, I'm often extremely proud of their achievement. From Arnold Vosloo playing the ""badie"" in almost everything that he stars in, to a farm girl from Benoni winning an Oscar, and more recently Sharlto Copley and Neil Blomkamp being a part of one the best science fictions to date — South Africans have made their mark in Tinsel Town. However, when Johannesburg-born director Gavin Hood took the helm of X- Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009, it was less impressive, and that is an understatement. Fan boys were eager to see something better than Brett Ratner's piece of rubbish X-Men: The Last Stand in 2006, but Hood didn't deliver the goods. But thankfully in 2011 Matthew Vaughn brought back the series standards when X-Men: First Class stunned audiences around the globe. Now James Mangold — the director who brought us Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma (2007) — gets into the driver's seat to try to keep up the pace Vaughn brought to the X-Men series. The story take place after the events of The Last Stand, with a flashback to the atomic bombing of Nagasaki during World War 2, and, not giving anything away, this scene really gets your attention with a mix of emotion, good acting and a pinch of digital computer wizardry. Fast-forward to present day and we see Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) living in the wilderness and being comforted by the ghost of his last love. He then finds himself on his way to Japan where the dying owner of the country's biggest technology company wants to repay the favour — by giving Wolverine an ""honourable death"". Wolverine gets caught up in a family dispute, and ultimately has to protect the tech-giant's granddaughter — and all the while he has to deal with not having the healing powers that he has been using his whole life. In a ""summer film"" aimed at teenagers and young adults, the action scenes are very important. This is where the director gets the job done, as the first major action scene is pretty far into the movie. The build- up with regards development is far more important, especially with a character-driven film like The Wolverine. Stand-out scenes include a fight on top of a bullet train, and a ninja assault on the family's home. However, in the third act this film becomes very predictable and then turns into the standard-issue formula of any superhero film. It is a nice change to have a film set in Japan, where the modern city- scape as well as the beautiful countryside with its traditional and cultural aspects, are showcased. There are a few jokes not suitable for children but it's nice that the film caters for older viewers, with Wolverine slicing and dicing his enemies with his adamantium claws.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I have mixed feeling about this one,"I will open review with this sentence,I won't lie I expected much more from this movie.When I looked at its budget,i knew it will be much more about CG nonsense than story driven and i was right.I only wished they did it properly,but sad truth they messed up badly.This movie is so awful when you watch it on big screen in 3D,that i wanted to throw at end of the film my phone at the stupid screen.Plot of film is not creative at all and what's even worse it isn't done well.From the beginning to the end,they are trying to wrap one mystery in another,doing it really bad.You end up completely lost in nonsense and confusion they create that you find your self having trouble to recall how this all started.This movie is suppose to take of from the X-men Last Standing and people who didn't watch it were even more confused and lost than i am.And why wouldn't they... I won't spoil you have to watch to see why.Its needles to say that beginning and end are like whole two new different plots and oh man its so bad.But on the other hand not all things are bad,there are some touchy scenes that can surprise you,Hugh Jackman (Logan)gave his best and save this movie in my opinion.Because of few rare events in the movie that are done surprisingly well,Hugh Jackman and because Wolverine is one of my favourite heroes in Marvel universe i will give it 6.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Solid,"For me the word to describe this film would probably be, solid. I feel it was definitely entertaining enough and delivered adequately in the action department, I particularly enjoyed to of the earlier action sequences(when Logan first arrives in Japan). The story was solid, and it was interesting to see this character in foreign territory. Also the idea as Wolverine as a kind of samurai is also interesting, although the lack of any real villain was a negative for me. I think any comic book film needs a strong villain.Overall, this film was good solid entertainment, without being overtly impressive or kicking on into a fourth or fifth gear. The performances are all good, and I left the cinema satisfied, although I still think the definitive ""Wolverine"" film is yet to be made.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good...,"In the future, mutants are mercilessly hunted by the Sentinels, gigantic robots created by Bolivar Trask. The few survivors need to live in hiding, otherwise they will also be killed.

The means found is to send Wolverine's consciousness on a journey through time, towards the 1970s. There it occupies the body of the Wolverine of the time, who seeks out the still young Xavier and Magneto so that, together, they can prevent this tragic future for mutants come true.It started very well, wonderfully impeccable photography, all of Logan's frustration and his partially insanity translated into thoughts and flashbacks, very good, however at a certain point it becomes a clichéd action movie, with many uninteresting martial arts, the high point of the film strong female characters and their fight scenes, too long, unattractive script, but a great visit to Tokyo, Nagasaki, bullet train, lovely, God willing, I'll be there this or the 24th, amen...",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Hugh Jackman at the helm has charisma, presence, and muscularity, but his vulnerability here adds more tension, and his restraint gives it extra power.

"Wolverine, Japan, samurai swords and lots of tiring action.","This film is a spin-off based on Logan, aka Wolverine, one of the X-Men, and seems to come more or less following ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"", giving this cartoon character a weight and charisma that other characters like Storm or Professor X himself seem to lack.In this film, Logan is taken on a trip to Tokyo to say goodbye to a friend, whom he saved when the atomic bomb exploded over Nagasaki, and who is now dying. He is a millionaire, has built a technological empire and will leave it to his granddaughter, who is threatened by the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia. Of course, Logan will have to protect her, and in the midst of all of this he will discover the truth about his presence in the country of the Rising Sun.Personally, I did not feel particularly involved by the film or the story, which seems like one of those films where they take advantage of a charismatic character and simply put him in a place or context where he has not yet appeared anywhere. The film is a little too long for the story told, it would have been interesting to cut it by thirty minutes in order to make it lighter, and the feeling it gets is that everything is just a pretext for the action scenes, where Wolverine slices things and shreds Japanese guys with the same ease with which I cut sausages for breakfast.The cast is led by the inevitable Hugh Jackman, back to the character who immortalized him to most people, and whom he plays without surprises. I haven't seen anything I haven't seen previously, in the extensive X-Men franchise, and the actor seems to be just earning money. Nothing against it, I also honestly earn my own, but it lacks talent and commitment here. Much more interesting was the performance of Rila Fukushima, impeccable in the action scenes and who was unstoppable with a katana in her hands. Tao Okamoto is beautiful and looked great in the film, as did Hiroyuki Sanada, who proved to have more talent than what he managed to reveal. Veteran Hal Yamanouchi was also a very good addition to the Japanese cast, and it was very enjoyable to hear Japanese in place of the ubiquitous US English we are used to. After all, if the story takes place in Japan with Japanese characters, what is the logic of speaking English all the time?Technically, I think it's an uninteresting film. Most of the action scenes take place on autopilot, with highly choreographed fights and without any blood dripping, as if it were a ballet. At one point, I felt sleepy with so much dancing. Cinematography does not bring us anything astounding. Sets and costumes, although they're basically what we could expect, with kimonos and traditional houses along with skyscrapers and fast trains, occasionally give us small pearls. I especially liked the robotic suit that appears at the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

None the less, the acting by Hugh is splendid, and Famke, as short as her role was in this movie, did a great job as well. The visual effects were great as well, no comments on that.

"Improvement over predecessor, but hasn't quite cracked formula","While it's not the best X-Men movie in the franchise, it's certainly better than X-Men Origins: Wolverine. There was one thing I didn't expect though, humor. I thought it was going to be a dark, gritty film. It is, but they still manage to mix humor. It's not enough, though. I thought the first half moved too slowly, and the second half was over too quickly.
There's one action scene in the first half. One! And it's incredibly fast, and hard to see. The second half had a predictable twist, and left you going ""Really, I knew this was going to happen 20 minutes in the film!""

An Above Average Comic Book Film,"So next on my list for the X-Men films is the 2nd solo Wolverine film, called The Wolverine and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Wolverine invited to Japan by a man he once saved, there he aims to survive a conspiracy involving his healing.Main Character
Hugh Jackman is once again back in the legendary role and he does a great job here. He really thrives in playing the loner Wolverine and it is really good to see him away from The X-Men in this really unique journey. He still has that gruff and amusing personality but you see how especially events in X-Men: The Last Stand really affect him as a person and how this whole experience really brings him to becoming The Wolverine.Supporting Characters
Rila Fukushima plays Yukio here and she does a good job here, her chemistry and banter with Wolverine is a highlight of the film and is probably the best character partnership in the film. There is also a small role for a member of the X-Men, I won't say who it is but it is pretty obvious and adds quite a bit to the story and the character of Wolverine. But the rest of the cast are really bland, the villains are generic and boring with some of the worst motivation you will see, there is also this romance for Wolverine and it is really weird and actually feels wrong due to the clear age difference between the two actors and characters, plus they have very little chemistry together.Story
The story is interesting, seeing Wolverine for the first time really feeling vulnerable in the franchise is interesting and it allows them to have different storytelling options. I just like seeing Wolverine in this world which is different for him and it makes him feel like a more unique and deep character. But this film also has some dull storytelling, the villain motivations just do not work and the twists in the movie are easy to predict and actually feel in contradiction to other things that happen in the movie.Script
The script is okay, there are some okay drama and some nice bit of humour that really fits the character of Wolverine. But the drama never hits the level that it could have done, plus it does feel a bit convoluted at times with certain aspects seeming unnecessary.Style
The style of the film has some great action scenes, especially one on top of a bullet train that is really thrilling and exciting. Seeing Wolverine go against ninjas is a fun experience and a nice change of pace from the other films. But this film's last act goes so badly it is unreal, the reveal is terrible and the last fight scene has way too much CGI and feels like it should be in a different much worse movie.Overall
Overall, this is an okay film. It does some things well but also does things poorly. If you are a fan of the character then it is a fun watch but it isn't one I would exactly rush to see it.Rating - 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nice Wolverine Spin-off. Much better than Origins,"At the beginning of the film we see how Wolverine processes the events from the last X-men film. Then he is asked to travel to Japan. An old rich businessman who saved Wolverine in the war, offers Wolverine to end his immortality so that he can just grow old and eventually die. Wolverine rejects the offer, but in one way or another he has lost his powerful powers.
Wolverine now has to save the granddaughter of the now deceased businessman because she inherited his business. Wolverine must protect her against a Japanese gang that appears to be under the leadership of the mysterious Viper.
The film can sometimes be a bit slow, but there is enough action and humor to keep you in the story. The story itself is beautiful, only sometimes predictable.
I was especially happy to see that Wolverine's claws really looked real, compared to Wolverine Origins. The biggest minus point I found to see the bone claws again. They seem less real and I am not a fan of them.
In retrospect, I liked the movie better than expected. Because of the trailer I had my doubts about Viper because she is not officially mutant, but in the film her mutation appeared to fit well and I found it an improvement compared to the comics. Just a shame that she can not now appear in the films at HYDRA, because the rights belong to different studios. Svetlana Khodchenkova plays the role of Viper perfectly.
Furthermore, I think this was Hugh Jackman's best performance of Wolverine of all X-men films. He has always been a fan of the Japanese story of Wolverine, which can be seen in the film about his acting work. The other actors also do well, but do not shine like Hugh Jackman and Svetlana Khodchenkova.
I do not understand that the film is 16+. There is only some violence in it, but nothing special. You also do not have to see the film in 3D. I only thought that the scene on the train was 3D worthy.
If you like superhero movies and especially an X-men fan, you should definitely see The Wolverine. He is much better than X-men Origins: Wolverine. Stay in front of the secret scene in the end.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Cool Spin-Off, Bland X-Men Movie","The Wolverine is a spin-off to the X-Men franchise that tells the story of what happens with Wolverine after the events of X-Men: The Last Stand. Basically he lives on his own with no goals or desires. One day, he meets a woman who tells him that he needs to go to Japan to say good-bye to an old dying friend. When Wolverine arrives, it is revealed that something else is going on entirely ... which I won't get into.I thought this movie was pretty solid. It had a great set-up and some really good characters. But compared to the other X-Men movies, this one is a little bit on the weaker side. The fun with the X-Men movies is to see all these different mutants with crazy abilities fight alongside and against each other. In this movie, there are only three mutants, Wolverine included. This is disappointing, especially since every X-Men movie has contained lots of cool and varied mutants. Even X-Men Origins: Wolverine did that.The villains are not that interesting. They're just bland Hollywood villains that we see in every generic action movie. Wolverine himself is a very cool character, and he does some bad-ass things. Some action scenes are really cool, like a scene involving a bullet train. But then we have more traditional fight scenes, which are boring because you can't see what the hell is going on.Now I'm gonna talk about the after-credits scene. And don't worry, I'm not gonna spoil what it is. Rather, I'm gonna spoil what it isn't. For those who think it means that Wolverine is joining The Avengers: Age of Ultron, he isn't. That's a little disappointing, 'cause I was almost certain it would be that. But it's still a really cool scene that will make a lot of X-Men fans happy.Overall, The Wolverine is a pretty cool movie. It has a couple really cool action scenes, a great protagonist and a cool setting. Though some parts are uninteresting (especially during the last part), it's still a fun ride.

wolverine perpetuates Asian stereotypes,"Yet another summer movie failure. Perhaps due to the change in writing and directing mid-production,the Wolverine is even worse than Origin.

Besides the completely nonsensical plot, I want to address the blatant racial issue with this film. At first I was excited that this was filmed with an Asian heavy cast, but it quickly turned into a disappointment. Asian women are depicted as submissive, weak, and easily fall for white men.

The 1982 Mini-Series finally on Film,"This film deserved much better than it got, I think this was one of the most true X-Men related films of them all. To the Boneheads who are spouting ""Who Wrote This?"" - Well, blame Chris Claremont and Frank Miller.I've got a copy of that first Wolverine Mini-Series, original printing.If you take this story and strip out the Mechanized Silver Samurai and Viper alterations, it's that exact story. The main characters are all there: Yukio,Mariko, Viper, Shingen, The Silver Samurai, and The Black Hand (Later referred to as ""The Hand"" in the books).There are also elements from early 90's Wolverine arcs, as Wolverine, when he had been stripped of Adamantium by Magneto in X-Men (Vol II) #25 and Wolverine #75, he wandered the world carrying the Sword of The Yashida Clan, which is shown in this film - A Sword made out of Metal from a Meteor, which Wolverine used to incapacitate the evil ""Bloodsport/Bloodscream"" later on in the series and later entrusted back to the Human Silver Samurai.There is even a nod to ""Cyber"" - An evil Mutant who was completely encased in Adamantium, who was the only enemy Wolverine really feared- Who was killed in Wolverine #100, his Adamantium leeched by Tyler Summers (Cyclop's Grandson from his son Cable) which he intended to put back into Logan but Logan refused to go through the bonding process and this reverted his genes and gave him an animal-like appearance.I don't remember the time-line much, it has after all been 30 years. Around that same time Professor X's son, Legion, went back in time to kill Magneto but kills Professor X instead, causing the ""M'kraan Crystal"" of the Shi'ar to crack, bending reality, thus causing the ""Age of Apocalypse"", an Alternate Timeline where it was all changed: And the Goal of that X-Men, led by Magneto, was to repair the M'kraan Crystal. This arc was done over 6 months worth of Alternate X-Men titles.Eventually all these arcs lead up to ""Days of Future Past"": And indeed, there is a huge reference to this at the end of the film.If anyone had followed the 1988 (Volume II) Wolverine, set in ""Madripoor"", they would remember two fellows, Roughhouse and Bloodsport who hounded Wolverine incognito as ""Master Patch"" - And so I initially thought that this rendition of ""Viper"" (Svetlana Khodchenkova) was a female version of Bloodsport, as Bloodsport was the only enemy that could suck out Wolverine's Healing factor. And, as Bloodsport/Scream's goal was to suck all of the life out of Logan, this is apt as the elder head of the Yashida Clan takes on this goal.But that was not the case, although Viper's Ability to weaken Logan's Mutant Healing factor was similar to Bloodsport/Scream, she was her own villain with her own agenda.As far as the film, this was the best X-Men related film since 2000, and as much as I liked ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" I like this one much more: Because none of the other films really got into who Logan really is, the fatalistic, tired of living Wolverine- Who although too tired to live, and not caring about much, because so much had been taken from him, he still fights as hard as he can.And THAT is why I loved the Comic Book Series, and why I like this installment of the films. Because, in their own way, Marvel is pulling all of the best story arcs and sticking them into these movies.And everything looks very good here, Hugh Jackman doesn't look much different than in the other films. This ""Weakened Wolverine"" was an interesting twist, allowed us to get to the dark aspects of the character.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine,"In the aftermath of Jean Grey's death, Logan has been living as a stray when his past invited him back to Japan to say goodbye to an old colleague and more.The Wolverine by James Mangold gives us hints of what Logan (the last film of Wolverine trilogy) will become. I praise the fight scenes and its cinematography which are best so far among the first ones. Hugh Jackman is again awesome in his portrayal. We have Japanese culture with yakuzas, samurais and kimonos. That is good.On the other hand, the plot and the generic music is its weakness wherein if better, the movie will pop more.

You don't have feelings for any of the characters they are hollow. After a while when I was trying to keep my eyes open the only taught I had was ""Plz end this please end this even if it kills Wolverine"".

Wolverine...,"""The Wolverine"" is the new story of Wolverine and how he is today. He lives a nomad life but when he summoned to Japan by an old acquaintance, he is embroiled in a conflict that forces him to confront his own demons. In this movie we watch a little bit from the history of Wolverine but with some differences and some new information come out.I really liked this movie but not as much as I liked the ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" which also had to do with Wolverine's history and past. I also liked this movie because of the interpretations of Hugh Jackman, Tao Okamoto who plays as Mariko and Svetlana Khodchenkova who plays as Viper and we watch this character of Marvel for first time.Finally I believe that everyone have to watch this movie because it shows us the after X-Men story and life of Wolverine and how the story continues.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than a Man of Steel,"For me this is the best Super heroes Movie for this year (until now). and Why I think it's better than Man of Steel is:1. Wolverine life is full with conflict, which is very Natural (don't ever expect a hero with a perfect life). 2. This Movie show that, although he is a superhero but he still have a weakness (Man of Steel almost not have a weakness except kryptonite, which is boring. Kal-el and general Zod punching each other, but with the same level of power they didn't ever bleeding). 3. The acting is so natural for me - Some people said that the Japanese actor language is very awkward, but the fact is that is the reality and perfect English for Japanese people may look this film is just like full American Film (examples with Kryptonian, is very weird to see an alien to use English, when did they learn English and why should they learn, they have they own language) 4. 60% Story and 40% Action, so what do you expect? Just an action movie without story?Punching and killing people without known the reason? A hurting heroesstill need to recovery and it's very Natural. 5. Jean Grey is Annoying,Yeah I'm agree it's very annoying, but then I'm realize, I have thesame problem with him, haunted by a past. and it's very annoying. andwe know what the reason is. 6. A hero doesn't always use a marvelous costume. Yes, is better than a superhero that used a costume from nowhere and the most awkward is the costume is perfectly fit on the user body sized, it seems like they know the hero body will be taller and mass, how about if it short or thin? 7. This is the hero without a mask or alter ego. just being himself.Some people said it's a messed movie, but for me this is the way a superhero movie has to be. Rate 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Adamantium, all over the place","What makes the Mutants so cool that it has spread into a franchise of six movies with the seventh one in the making? Some of the fans would say ""multiple superheroes at the price of one ticket"". Many others would agree to a different answer: The Wolverine.That perhaps is the only reason why Wolverine features in every X-men movie, an honor that no other mutant enjoys. Several reasons to this: retractable Adamantium claw, ripped off body & above all, Invincibility.""The Wolverine"" is a bold attempt in many ways. Unlike other X men movies where you get to see various mutants alongside Logan, this one is pretty much a one man show. This movie also brings out the emotional coefficient of Logan in almost every scene, something which become irritating at one point.Logan is almost convinced that ""Invincibility can indeed be a curse"". But if living across centuries, not aging one bit and getting the attention of every beauty on the planet can be a curse, then somebody please curse me.The action sequences do not disappoint but one must have the patience to sit through the lecture class between the action scenes.On the whole the movie seemed a bit slow, mainly because of the one man show and it was hard to even imagine ""pain"" and ""Wolverine"" in the same sentence.The only consolation in this movie was Hugh Jackman himself. Playing the same role in seven (including the one in making) different movies is not something that every actor can imagine of (Unless you are Harry potter & Co). However ironic it may sound, with that huge sideburns, we might as well start calling Jackman as ""Hairy Potter"".I hope the Wolverine trilogy ends on a high note.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A bore,"Hugh Jackman is fine in the role, as always, and some of the action sequences are good (though I hated the fight on top of the bullet train - it struck me as incredibly stupid), but the story is fairly cliché and there's just no flow. The story has Wolverine summoned to Japan to say goodbye to an old acquaintance whose life he saved in WWII (Hal Yamanouchi). There he gets pulled into a web of intrigue and ninjas. Rila Fukushima provides able support as a red haired martial artist with superior sword skills. Tao Okamoto is pretty but dull as the love interest. Svetlana Khodchenkova is embarrassingly bad as a prostitute, er, doctor who is also not very secretly an evil mutant. She feels way out of place. Marvel has done such a good job with their Avengers franchise, and the last X-Men movie was pretty good, but this is a dud. A lot of the critics who liked it liked it specifically because it separated this hero from his milieu, and I think that's partly why I didn't like it much at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good sequel to the Wolverine/X-Men franchise,"I'm not a Marvel super-fan so am not as clued up as some, but do enjoy the stories... especially Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). For obvious reasons. This appealed to me because of the Japanese/Samurai/Ronin connection, that I find interesting. The storyline was more convoluted, to my way of thinking, than the other Wolverine film, and even some of the X-Men. The film is shown through a series of fantasy/dream shots and also flashbacks as well as up to date action interspersed and shows Wolverine to be vulnerable and a deeper character.Hugh Jackman's performance was superb; physical, emotional and powerful, and I have come to really appreciate Hiroyuki Sanada (47 Ronin, The Railway Man), a superb actor who has just ""popped up"" in Western films recently. The other actors were a little laboured in their performances but I liked Tao Okamoto (Mariko) and Rila Fukushima (Yukio) despite this, and there was much in their performances that was impressive most spectacularly some of the fight scenes. The Samurai sword - Katana - was shown to good effect in the film in some amazing sword fights often katana vs adamantium blades. The two girls, especially Yukio were very good. There was some humour, but it was mainly drama and action, fairly predictable and I felt the film went on a bit too long. The SFX were mainly very good, but there were a few bits that were a bit less slick and a little silliness - a few goofs. It was however, an enjoyable hour or so and I wouldn't be averse to seeing it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fun and entertaining plot, beautiful Japanese landscapes and compelling character development.","This is a fun movie with a simple and yet entertaining plot. I like how the character of Logan is developed: the tragic loss that still hunts him down is painfully visible; Hugh Jackman gave one of the best Wolverine interpretations here. Dialogues are interesting and compelling, never too long or tedious and they always add more details by thickening the plot. Action sequences are well directed and I loved to see duels with swords and martial arts fights. I think that it was different than the usual X-Men film. There are some dynamic and unexpected moments. I loved the fact creators decided to let Japanese actors speak in their native language between each other, instead of just speaking in English, which would have been so unnatural. The final fight is one of the best ones of the entire saga, and the stunts are absolutely on point. The only small complaint that I have is the ending that I personally consider a bit generic.The photography is absolutely amazing, I loved the Japanese landscapes, which are naturally very photogenic. Locations and set designs seem authentic to the Oriental culture. The lighting is stunning and very polished. Visual effects are amazing, animations look fluid and natural. I think that a lot of VFX were actually practical and a few things made out in CGI, which was the right call. I personally did not feel the almost two and a half hour runtime, time flew. Wish that more superhero movies were made like this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Wolf (Six) Pack,"This film is mildly recommended.The Wolfman is back, all ripped abs and muscles bulging, with hirsute chest and hands of steel and a hot-blooded temper to match. Marvel's favorite mutant, Wolverine, takes center stage again in his second solo feature, aptly titled The Wolverine, an action adventure movie that is strong on action but not very adventurous in its story. The film clearly follows a tried and true formula and rarely breaks away from it, although there is a nice twist toward the end of the film.James Mangold directs this installment with mixed results, mostly positive. The director competently stages the set pieces with enough excitement and energy, although some of the filming and editing is far too close-up and, pardon the pun, choppy. Some of the CGI is highly effective, like a wonderful chase sequence aboard a fast-moving train (the film's best scene). But at times, the visual effects completely miss the mark, as in an earlier sequence involving the more noticeable appearance of an artificial looking bear that could give Yogi some competition. The director also tries to build some character development and complicated plotting in his film which is rare for this type of genre. Unfortunately, the screenplay and dialog by Mark Bombard and Scott Frank never really connects with the goings-on and chases.The plot goes something like this: Wolverine is all angst-ridden and is summoned to visit a Japanese ex-soldier whose life he once saved. It is there that Wolverine is asked to protect his granddaughter, Mariko, from harm as he fights the Yakuza and other sinister forces, even though our superhero is beginning to show signs of weakening power and mortality.Of course, without Hugh Jackman perfectly cast as its superhero, there could not be a viable franchise. The actor is such a valuable commodity and the main reason for viewing this film. (There are certainly plenty of opportunities to see Jackman shirtless or in the buff and the filmmakers have enough gratuitous shots to please his doting admirers, both male and female alike. There are also enough action sequences to satisfy comic book aficionados as well.) Jackman invests in this role and his commanding presence gives the film some plausibility.Yet it's the down time in between the action sequences that tend to slow down the film a bit. Characters are introduced without any real definition and their motives and actions seems suspect or they appear evil from the start with no credible explanation. (Any savvy moviegoer will know one of the villains is a walking stereotype, obviously bad from the onset due to her coiffure and stylish appearance.)The actors play their parts earnestly and it's refreshing to see that the movie was filmed on location in Japan and utilized native actors for the roles. Tao Okamoto is Mariko and Rila Fukushima plays Wolverine's martial arts sidekick. Both actresses efficiently deliver the necessary drama to the proceedings and have a fine chemistry with Jackman throughout the film.The Wolverine doesn't bite off more than it can chew. It's well-made, entertaining, yet nondescript. It is again just another one of the many comic book movies that we've seen countless times before. The movie left me wanting more. My expectations were higher and I was still...hungry...like a wolf, for a more satisfying movie-going experience that The Wolverine never accomplished for me. GRADE: B-NOTE: The PG-13 rating seems off the mark too with so much blood, violence, and profanity on display. Wolverine must have used his special powers to avoid the film's much deserved R- rating. Just another example of this archaic, subjective, and ineffective rating system of ours.ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not a bad film but could have been a lot better,"This film works well on many levels. The action sequences are solid, especially the scene on the bullet train. The score is excellent and the sets, costumes, etc. are well done. Acting is also good with a solid cast including of course Hugh Jackman reprising a role he is very familiar with. Okamoto does reasonably well, but she is just a bit too weak and waifish - almost skeletal - it would have been better if she had put on a few pounds of muscle for the role.There are several plot holes but these are also problems in the source material apparently. The most annoying one is the bombing of Nagasaki in the opening scene which shows Japanese soldiers performing seppuku as if they knew what the bomb would do. The reality is that the bombs were a surprise to everyone and the scene at Hiroshima after the first one was mass confusion - there is no way the soldiers could have known what was about to hit them. Also, it was a cloudy day, etc...But finally, the entire movie is just a tad bit anti-climactic. It's hard to say why, but there is never really a sense that Wolverine or his friends are truly in mortal danger. The action sequences feel just a bit too staged.This is still a decent movie but you will be left thinking it could have been so much more.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

wonderful,"The Wolverine, a razor-sharp journey into the heart of one of Marvel's most enigmatic characters. Hugh Jackman, in his signature role, delivers a performance that cuts deep, showcasing the internal struggle of Logan with a raw intensity. The film editing seamlessly blends brutal action sequences with moments of introspection, crafting a narrative that slices through the complexities of Wolverine's tortured soul. The strength of The Wolverine lies in its exploration of Logan's vulnerability and the price of immortality. While the pacing occasionally felt a bit uneven, the music echoed the film's emotional beats, adding a poignant layer to the visceral experience. Cinematography takes us from the neon-lit streets of Japan to the rugged wilderness, capturing the duality of Wolverine's existence. At 7/10, The Wolverine is a visceral and introspective chapter in Logan's saga, a film that digs deep beneath the adamantium claws to reveal the humanity within.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Turning Japanese. 72.5+%,"I have to confess that I haven't been following this series (of franchises) religiously but returned to it for this instalment (this might be my first movie in the Wolverine's franchise). Generally I might watch the first in a franchise but stop after that one or the sequel (because they're ""meh""). Fortunately this movie doesn't have anything as silly as a mutant with a gene which affects the weather (!!).Anyway, in this movie you get to see the title character's back story, as far as his pre-present-day existence...i.e. his time fighting in World War II (at least in the Wolverine's flashbacks or nightmares). An important relationship in this movie is shown in that back story which will lead the Wolverine to return to Japan (where he fought in World War 2) in order to meet the Japanese soldier he was imprisoned by back then.An interesting element of the plot concerns the offer to Wolverine to give up his invincibility in exchange for a mortal life.There are some good visuals in this movie (although the 3D option wasn't much of a positive...but I saw the movie on a smallish screen...but I doubt that by itself diminished the effect much) and the fight scene on the bullet train is one of the all time great action sequences, equivalent to the vehicle chases in ""Mad Max 2"" or the car chase in ""For your eyes only"" as far as exhilaration goes. The fight scene is visceral despite obviously being a computer generated effect.As for the cast, Tao Okamoto as the WWII Japanese soldier's granddaughter Mariko is elegant and beautiful in a Grace Kelly kind of way. Mariko's childhood friend Yukio (Rila Fukushima) puts a praying mantis to mind. Since the film is set in Japan, there are obviously a lot of Japanese names. Following or remembering who was who became an issue for me as a result (i.e. when names were dropped in conversation and that person wasn't there at the time).There are slow parts to the movie and I liked the incidental Japanese music which I sometimes noticed during these passages. There are also some good incidental jokes in this movie which I liked...e.g. the scene where the Wolverine is required to clean up for a meeting. Also liked the joke about the pool...although I'm sure I've heard the same joke in another movie...I just can't remember which!). Other times there are lots of fights between Wolverine and ninjas or Yakuza.I get the impression that I missed some back story provided in an earlier movie but it didn't detract too much...i.e. the topic which gives the Wolverine nightmares.Miscellaneous:The end credits have plenty of crew using Japanese script for their names.I get the impression that the entire film was shot in Australia, in which case...I didn't notice that it wasn't in Japan!As per usual(?) there are sequences from a forthcoming movie featuring at least Wolverine...another X-Men outing it looks like...and I haven't been following that franchise since very early on.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Wolverine,I actually quite enjoy this film. I like the darker tone and High Jackman gives a great performance.

Alright.,"The Wolverine had the task of rejuvenating the Wolverine franchise after the failed attempt of X- Men Origins. Did it succeed? Did it fail? I think it did pretty alright. This was mostly a character driven film with very little plot. It starts off strong with a very emotional and intense scene, but from there the film starts to lose path. The viper chick was a useless character that felt forced into the script in order to have more than two mutants. The Wolverine lacked a villain with strong presence, a plot, and an impactful score especially for a superhero movie. Hugh Jackman is at his best, and at this point it feels as if nobody else can play the legendary comic book character but him. The fight scenes had very good choreography, but the shaky camera made it hard to focus in what was going on. I especially like the train fight scene, even if it did make the eyebrows of every physicist rise. I appreciate this movie because they are at least on the right path to making wolverine movies, which origins failed to accomplish, but I cannot excuse The Wolverine of its empty plot driven solely on the development of one character surrounded by many seemingly empty characters.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ugh. What a boring movie.,"This is a potentially career-killing film.I don't know where to begin, except to say that the production quality of the film is evidently lacking. It feels like a bad TV movie of the week.The film is strangely quiet, and lacking a musical score. The dialogue which attempts to replace it, fails miserably. The film plods along, taking seemingly forever to get to the end.Another problem is that Wolverine has no charm. His lines are all wooden and emotionless. Honestly, while I like Hugh Jackman, I never thought he made a good Wolverine. The comic character was more heavy set physically, and less of a gentleman.No one can seriously claim that ""Wolverine"" is a good movie. Marvel should aim a lot higher.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"An unconventional, thoughtful superhero film - a fine addition to the franchise","Saw a preview of ""The Wolverine"" before it was released in 2013. Here's my review the next day.A true character-driven entry in the X-Men movie franchise, it refuses to follow the traditional Hollywood comic book movie conventions. What special effects there were ended up being pretty low-key except in the last 20 minutes. Hugh Jackman was terrific. Entirely convincing and powerfully physical in the many fight scenes that punctuated the movie. The story closely parallels original comic book lines about Wolverine's hermitlike withdrawal in the wilds of Canada (Yukon) and his introspection about his place in the world. The majority of the film takes place in Japan and takes care to highlight traditional cultural values there.To fully appreciate this entry, I'd suggest viewing the 2006 film, X-Men: The Last Stand beforehand. A hint: you'll want to stay for the end credits. There's an embedded sequence there you won't want to miss. P. S.- Saw the film in 3D, but the end credits indicated this effect was added afterward. My sense was that it added nothing to the experience. Save your money and see it in 2D. HIGHLY recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wolverine is back with a vengeance,"This movie really served one specific purpose. I think its goal was to give a true Wolverine movie for the fans, and scratch X-Men Origins: Wolverine from their minds. And it does exactly that.The movie's plot is based on a comic, so expect to see a lot of references to other Marvel things in the movie, some subtle, some obvious. The special effects are very well done in almost every instance, and the claws actually look real this time around. Of course, this movie isn't going to be like the Dark Knight trilogy (which it seems a lot of people relate superhero movies to these days). It has cheesy dialogue that one can only expect from Wolverine. But they make it work well.One thing I truly disliked about the movie was an unavoidable issue. Bone claws. I think it is safe to say that nobody likes the bone claws. I know they were necessary, but they aren't in any way ""cool""...Also, I feel like the ending was a little abrupt, and it didn't show how Wolverine recovered from the events of the film.As you probably know by now, make sure you stay past the credits. I practically started crying with excitement when I saw this hidden ending. If you are a true X-Men fan, you can probably form an idea of what/who is in the ending, but it was absolutely perfect for said fans nonetheless.I'd definitely recommend it to any superhero lovers.

"Boring, Yawn, Once was Enough","I am certainly not an expert on X-Men and the Wolverine. I only wished I had read some reviews before I went to see this. I like Hugh Jackman, but the plot and the pace of this film were too boring. It starts out interesting enough but it is downhill from there. 75% of the film IMHO is violent. The fight scenes could have been shortened for at least 30 minutes. The film is 126 minutes long. I could have tolerated it better if it was 96 minutes long. I left it feeling I had wasted my time, and I would definitely not recommend it to my friends. I am not a fan of violence coupled with a non-engaging plot. I found myself wanting it to be over long before it was. The action scene fight on the Bullet train made me think of Skyfall the James Bond movie which had a train scene fight as well. That movie was so much better than this. The PG-13 rating should be more of an R because of so much violence and adult topics. It's best for the over 17 audience, not the early teens.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"More or less based on the series, but almost completely changed including only good climax.","One of the hardest things about reviewing movies is being objective, especially if one is familiar with and fond of original source material. For example, I love the four-issue ""Wolverine"" comic book mini-series written by Chris Claremont, drawn by Frank Miller and published in 1982. This is one of my all-time favorite comics. James Mangold's new movie The Wolverine is more or less based on this series, but almost completely changed. Claremont doesn't even get a ""story by"" credit.Now my job is to decide whether The Wolverine is a good movie despite those changes, or even perhaps because of them. Considering the changes on their own, they start to sound pretty stupid, designed more for summer blockbuster purposes than to serve the story.First up is the inclusion of a supervillain, Viper (played by a slinky blonde Russian with a pert nose, Svetlana Khodchenkova). What she's actually doing in the story, who she's working for and what her agenda is, are all up for interpretation. Next we have a giant robot that fights Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) during the big climax, plus a ""surprise"" reveal when we find out who is inside it.Then there's a long sequence wherein Wolverine (also known as Logan) loses his super-healing ability and suffers mortal wounds, just like the rest of us. This idea was also attempted in Superman II, perhaps as a way to get the audience to ""identify"" with the superhero a bit more, but it really doesn't work. Plus the filmmakers seem to have forgotten that it's this healing ability that allows Wolverine to unsheathe his claws, which tear through his skin each time.Aside from these blunders, the rest of the characters just don't seem the same. In the original comic, Wolverine has already met and fallen in love with Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and goes to Japan to rescue her from an arranged marriage, but must navigate a complex web of honor and duty in his dealings with Mariko's father Shinghen.Now there's a whole plot about Wolverine going to Japan to meet up with Mariko's grandfather, whom he saved during the Nagasaki bombing. He doesn't even meet Mariko until he gets there. The grandfather's big plan is to steal Wolverine's healing power. When assassins try to kill Mariko during the old man's funeral (for no apparent reason), Wolvie rescues her and they go on the run together while falling in love.In the comic, a feisty assassin called Yukio falls for Wolverine, but betrays him. She's here, too, but pretty much as window dressing (played by Rila Fukushima). She more or less tags along with him now and fights the secondary bad guys. Also, Wolverine occasionally suffers from nightmares where he speaks to Jean Grey (Famke Janssen).The movie's opening follows the comic book's -- Wolverine stalking an injured bear -- but it, too is changed just a bit to fit Wolverine's ""crisis-of-conscience."" (He's not going to be violent anymore.) So whereas the comic book's opening was dramatic and suspenseful, here it becomes more of a coincidence.Mangold has become a pretty good craftsman, especially when it comes to low-stakes genre films. He was at his best on 3:10 to Yuma (2007), and both Identity (2003) and Knight and Day (2010) had their good points. However, on The Wolverine, he appears checked out. The action sequences feel obligatory (and shaky) and the needless 3D effects don't help much. It definitely starts to slog after about an hour.Jackman is probably the movie's high point. He was always a great casting choice for Wolverine, and he makes an appealingly tormented, tough character. It's just that he has no one remotely interesting to play off of, and a fairly uninteresting plot to wade through.Even so, fans will be relieved that The Wolverine is better than both X- Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) and Brett Ratner's X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), even if it's not as good as the other three films in this series (X-Men, X2: X-Men United, and X-Men: First Class). Not exactly glowing praise, but at least I can always go back and re-read the comic book",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A Bit Generic, but Amazing Logan","I actually really enjoyed this. I was very interested in just the fact that Wolverine was in Japan. I didn't think he could be this cool. This movie also made me really care for the Wolverine character. James Mangold really explores the side of Logan that's down on his luck. That's why I look forward to the movie Logan. It does start to kind of lose that touch when you get into the more generic side of things. Generic villain, and some generic action. I do however like the more complex relationship that he had with Logan. It adds more depth to his character. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the action we got in here.

Criminal waist,"Considering how much I liked 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' I was actually exited about this movie; especially when I heard it was going to be set in Japan and have a lot of elements of a Yakuza film. I love Japan, especially in Superheroes. And in my naivety I thought there was no way they could botch this. Oh how wrong I was. Following the events of 'X-Men: Last Stand' Wolverine is living by himself and rocking a hobo beard up in Alaska. He is found by another mutant named Yukio who has been sent to find Wolerine. As it turns out he had an old friend from Japan whose life he once saved. The friend is now the head of a powerful Yakuza family but is also dying. Wolverine goes to pay him his last respects but gets caught up in all kinds of family power struggles. This is the set up to an awesome movie and in the hands of a different creative team it might have worked but not here, not with this director, not with these writers, not with these producers, and certainly not with this cast. I know Wolverine is supposed to be a bad ass but if you take out the word bad you're just left with an ass and that's what he in this movie. He's not the hero anymore, he's this obnoxious hero stand-in who we're keeping around until a real hero can be found. The Yakuza angle in this movie is way underutilized, sure there are some cool action scenes but they're shot so poorly and use so much CGI that they end up being boring. I should never be able to say that about a man with claws fighting a pair of guys on top of a speeding train, with katanas and guns! With the exception of Yukio and Wolverine, but only because there's so much of him, the characters in this movie are bland especially the weak villains, the worst offender is Madam Hydra who is technically an Avengers villains but she's also a mutant so she's kinda stuck in the middle and they apparently had to cut back some of her aspects which may be why she is so one dimensional; Poison Ivy from 'Batman & Robin' was more interesting because at least she had a personality. Wolverine's character development in this is nonexistent; his main thing is that he losses his regenerative powers briefly which might have been interesting if it was actually used but instead it just serves to try and make the fight scenes more interesting. This movie's cardinal sin is its run time, two hours but not like 'Lord of the Rings' where every minute is important but because Superhero movies are supposed to be two hours and so we need to pad this film out. This movie takes a perfect concept and completely waists it.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Severely underrated,"After second viewing I can confidently say that The Wolverine is my favourite X-Men movie to date (yes, I like it better than Logan), also one of my favourite superhero movies.Hugh Jackman with his sarcasm and snarky one-liners is as good as Wolverine gets in any of the movies he's in. The Japanese cast also does a great job, and not only that but the actress playing Mariko (Tao Okamoto) is breathtakingly beautiful in the film.I like the fact that it is set in Japan which makes the look and the atmosphere of the film unique compared to most comic book flicks which usually take place in the U.S. (or Europe). Japan with its peculiar culture, traditions and architecture really feels like a whole different world, and the film conveys that very well.The action sequences are nicely choreographed and shot, two of them (the amazing train fight scene and the funeral sequence) are especially entertaining. The characters are well fleshed out, the writing and the acting gives you the chance to care for them, and makes the emotional moments work. The Wolverine is really about the characters more than anything else.It is true that the last act, with the two villains, almost feels like a different movie, the tone becomes inconsistent with the rest of the film. But the story, the characters and the action throughout most of the movie was so engaging and fun to watch that a weaker third act couldn't ruin the overall experience for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a mess!,"I have just seen this for the second time in the hope of it making more sense the second time around. It does not.I tried to view it like one of characters wasn't quite what he/she appeared to be, but it didn't help.The plot of this is drivel from about 20% into it. The first 20% was interesting where we just saw Logan coping with what happened and what he did in X-men 3. When he arrives in Japan the movie bogs down to drivel.It has action sequences that doesn't make sense with uninteresting people. There is one exception to this. One character is interesting, Yukio. She is the only one that displays any real sense of having a past, and being a real character with her own emotions and sense of self.The plot doesn't make any sense what so ever, even the second time watching it. So when the movie moves towards the climax of the story it so uninteresting that I was about to sleep. And by the time the main bad guy has the final showdown with Wolverine it is very predictable how this is going to end.Actually the most interesting scene in the entire movie is at the very end, after the main plot has been concluded, when we see a couple of familiar characters from previous X-men movies in an airport. This little scene has more fire and more character that it seems to be written and directed by other people than the movie proper.I would most definitely say that this is the worst of the X-men movies. Even Origins: Wolverine is better than this. With the other Marvel movies, like Avengers, Captain America and Iron Man, and DC's Dark Knight Trilogy we know by now that superhero movies can be really great.I would not recommend anyone watching this piece of nonsense.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Good character development, but nothing too spectacular","Stays mostly true to the comics and is a decent backstory on Wolverine/Logan, and so much better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine'! It's basically set after X-Men 3 and sees Wolverine head to Japan to find peace/reconcile his past.There's a few deviations from the comics - the Silver Samurai & Viper aren't quite done right, but are decent villains - but it's nice to see Mariko & Yukio, and have a less frantic pace for some of the film. The final third is good, but nothing too extraordinary.

Fuzzy Wolverine,"Like James Bond in You only live twice, Wolverine turns Japanese which adds some exotic Japanese locations and actions to the mix but the plot is so hackneyed and nonsensical as it makes no sense whatsoever and it really lets the film down.The X-Men universe is getting to be tiresome despite getting rejuvenated a few years earlier in X-men: First Class only then to make another stand alone Wolverine film which reverses the good work they did in the prequels and quickly sours the freshness.Hugh Jackman might have got comfortable with his hair and claws but he needs better material.

A C+ for the Australian Mutant,"Ever since Hugh Jackman's debut as the Wolverine in X-Men, back in 2002, it was clear he was not just good at the performance - he was made for it. Thus, movie director Gavin Hood was hired to anchor spin off 'X-Men Origins Wolverine'; it was rather bland with boring characters but Jackman's acting was impeccable and the action sequences pleased.Years later we have, 'The Wolverine.' A piece based on Frank Miller's graphic work, set after the events of the main X-Men trilogy. Jackman's Logan (alias to Wolverine) is a recluse, living on the edge as you may gather with his thick, bushy beard and scruffy general appearance. To his surprise a female ninja warrior (Rila Fukushima) whisks him away to Tokyo, Japan following her master's orders (Hal Yamanouchi). Her master is willing to reward Logan for originally saving his life - during a civil war in the past - by trading immortality for mortality. However, when Logan refuses, he then becomes protector to his grand daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) who is being sought by highly trained assassins.'The Wolverine' lasts 126 minutes in duration; for approximately 90-95 minutes it had me intrigued. Action takes a back seat for story and character development which is great and when the sequences of action do arise they are excellent. One scene in particular where Logan battles with numerous Japanese assassins on a bullet train looks and feels exhilarating. The cast all perform with solidity.By faults come in the final quarter or so of the film (90-95 minutes plus) when the story refracts off into a different direction in a pointless bid to extend the running time. It follows the villainous plots of Svetlana Khodchenkova's character Viper. Again she performs well in her role but is a pointless character which doesn't add anything to the main plot, just extends the running time.Entailed in that final quarter is a flurry of action sequences that feel as if they have been forced in. It quickly becomes tiresome and this long, ponderous final half an hour (or so) becomes a little ridiculous, particularly with a twist many will struggle to find the logic behind.Excellent for a larger portion than it is not, 'The Wolverine' can just about stand on its own two feet without Jackman carrying the entirety on his shoulders.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
no real plot but watchable and bad 3D,"I always had mixed feelings about flicks about superhero's and the X-men wasn't any exception. Still, you watch them and sometimes are left with a bitter feeling. The spin-off Wolverine gave us a new twist on the X- men story. It's naturally all about the Wolverine Logan but we do have other characters from X-men in it so you have to know a bit of the story and The Wolverine is no exception. It doesn't stand on it's own. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) do plays an important role even as she's in it for a few minutes. Nevertheless, if you don't know any of the history you can watch it but you will be left with some questions. Especially at the end, be aware that, a thing we do see often nowadays, not to turn the disc on stop, even as the end credits are running suddenly we move back to the flick and it's a really important part. Nothing to do with The Wolverine but with the whole X-men saga.The flick itself wasn't that bad at all but you have to understand the Japanese world to like this picture because it all take place in Japan and has a mixture of Samurai and Yakuza. I had two problems with this flick, but one I could get over, it doesn't has any blood or cruelty all over the flick, sure, The Wolverine gets hurt but heals himself but I mean, when swords are battling with Logan, we never see swords going into the flesh, or when the wolverine gets mad and smashes his claws into the flesh it's all done off-camera. But I knew that before, it was rated 12 years. But I did had a problem with the 3D. It just never worked out. here and there but I never had the 3D experience I had with other blockbusters. The effects on the other hand are good but not sublime. The train scene is excellent but their were other effects like the healing that I didn't like at all.Mixed emotions again with the X-men..., simple story line and of course an open ending..For many the best so far in the X-men franchise. It wasn't bad I admit but not a wowser.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A solid entry in the franchise, but definitely overshadowed by future installments.","The Wolverine is a great example of a movie that, at the time, felt very necessary and a step in the right direction, but in the context of the series as it developed, feels a bit redundant.Don't get me wrong; Wolverine-in-Japan is a great story arc and I love that this series continues to openly dig into the vast X-Men lore for inspiration. I think the movie itself has a lot of fun moments and some of the most competently directed and choreographed action sequences of the series.I see a lot of the criticisms being that the film is ""nearly derailed"" in the third act, yet again that bubbling criticism that we want to see Wolverine (and maybe, the X-Men in general) more ""grounded in reality."" No, put away the robotic super samurais and the poison spitting henchwoman! We want Wolverine vs the Yakuza! (Something we get)While yes, the BEST scene in this movie involves Wolverine facing off against normal humans on the top of a bullet train careening through Tokyo, I still don't fully understand where this sentiment comes from. It's a movie about an immortal mutant who has indestructible (kinda) metal claws coming out of his hands. Why do we need to strip it of all of its wacky elements again?I understand that tonally, it may feel a bit off, but honestly, the third act of this movie is completely fine to me. X-Men movies are about mutants. It's fine. In fact, if the film actually leaned into it more and just introduced Lady Deathstrike, as you know...the actual comics did, I don't think anyone would be complaining.I also can't deny the best aspect of this movie is its setting. Japan remains a fascinating place to Western audiences for a reason and I think the film does a great job at the ""fish-out-of-water"" aspect and introducing us to basic elements of Japanese culture. It's nice to see the X-verse expand outside of the United States too.Unfortunately, despite some amazing Japanese legends in this film and generally good performances, there really aren't any standout characters here. No one who you'd really desire to see again and I think that was a shame.It's also a movie ""about"" the character in a way that feels refreshing; we get to understand some of the ramifications of The Last Stand and the emotional impact it had on Wolverine. Hugh Jackman, once again, is amazing. To reiterate how perfectly cast he was feels like commenting on how blue the sky is on a summer day at this point.However, I think in a post-Logan world, where we've seen a gritty, dark, emotionally powerful, and R-rated version of this story, that leans even heavier into its spaghetti Western sensibilities and explores many of the same ideas...do we need this movie?I know there's an extended, ""more violent"" version of this, but it sort of feels like a dress rehearsal for Logan and only barely a bridge to Days of Future Past (both which I believe are much better movies). And while this may sound crazy, I actually kind of enjoyed the hokey fun of X-Men Origins: Wolverine a bit more. I'm not saying this movie didn't need to be made, and I enjoy it overall, but it's certainly not one that I feel a need to get back to.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
So Much Better Than X-MEN: ORIGINS,"After the utter disappointment of X-MEN ORIGINS, I was less than thrilled for a new solo adventure for Marvel's adamantium-clawed mutant. The shoddy plot, cable television level CG, and blatant abuse of Deadpool/Wade Wilson still leave a bad taste in my mouth five years after it was dumped into theaters. Fox hasn't got the greatest track record with its comic properties, with it's disappointments leaving a stronger impression than its successes. I never read the Chris Claremont/Frank Miller Japan story arc in the Wolverine comics, and the only James Mangold films I've ever seen were IDENTITY and WALK THE LINE (which were good, but didn't exactly imply he had the mindset for a comic book film). To simplify, I had no real draw to this film other than an ongoing hope that it just had to be better than the last Wolverine film. And, wow, it was. THE WOLVERINE is set a while after the events of THE LAST STAND. Logan is living off the grid, sleeping in the woods with only a radio and his nightmares to keep him company. He is found by a young Japanese woman, Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who insists he accompany her to Japan. There is a man from Logan's past on his deathbed and wishes to say goodbye to the mutant who once saved his life. The man, Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), offers Logan an opportunity for freedom from the pain of his immortal life. No longer would he have to live on as those he loves die around him. He turns him down, the old man dies, and that's when Logan's problems truly begin. He loses his healing abilities and is forced on the run to protect Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), while at the same time trying to discover who's behind it.I actually really enjoyed THE WOLVERINE. It's a lot better than I anticipated, especially if you catch the unrated version that was released on home video. It's your fix for all the brutal Wolverine action our lives have been missing in the PG-13 X-MEN film universe. Without the rest of the X-Men around to bother him with those pesky morals, Logan gets to cut loose (no pun intended). He's not going up against a bunch of mutants this time with super strength or high endurance. He's (mostly) going against regular humans who crumple under the assault of his adamantium claws and animalistic rage. The loss of his mutant healing abilities add a nice touch to the film too. The biggest problem with a character such as Wolverine is that he's never truly in danger. There's not much that anyone can do to him that he wouldn't recover from and soon proceed to eviscerate them. Without his healing abilities, he's finally at risk, and so is Mariko. Mariko's being hunted by the Yakuza following her grandfather's death and Logan makes it his mission to protect her. This leads to some nice character moments as Logan allows himself to get close to someone for the first real time since the death of Jean Grey, a death that continues to haunt him. THE WOLVERINE is just as much a character piece as it is a comic book/action film. We still get loads of Wolverine action but it's interspersed with chances to develop his character in regards to his budding romance with Mariko and his friendship with the beautiful Yukio. Rila Fukushima is probably my favorite part of the entire film. Her character Yukio is an exotic beauty and a masterful fighter in both hand-to-hand combat and katanas. Plus, she's a mutant because it was necessary for some interesting plot foreshadowing (and literally nothing else).THE WOLVERINE is not without it's flaws though. The movie drags on a little in the midsection when the bulk of the character development is placed. I didn't mind it too much but it was enough of a lull that my buddy actually fell asleep in the theater for a few minutes at that point. Honestly, it's not that bothersome. I was more turned off by the character of Viper. It just wouldn't be an X-Men film if there wasn't at least one character shoe-horned in to fill out the mutant quota. Oh yeah, she's a mutant in the movie too (while he character in the comics wasn't) and, as I understand it, she had nothing to do with the Japanese story arc. She's just here because they wanted a mid-level mutant villain. I don't care much for her inclusion in the movie and Svetlana Khodchenkova doesn't do much but chew scenery, giving no real depth other than being evil. Wasteful.I love that the majority of the movie is a more toned down, character-centric film that the other comic movies out there but it all devolves into the usual sci- fi/fantasy/action stuff. Big baddie, lot's of fighting, epic conclusionall that stuff. Also, I've got to say I saw all the major plot points coming a mile away. I knew who was behind most the evil-doings just from having seen the trailers. Still, it wasn't enough to taint the experience. I was pleasantly surprised by THE WOLVERINE and I forgive Fox for the mess that was X-MEN ORIGINS. While I wouldn't rank it up there with my favorite comic book movies, it was still a great entry in the X-Men cinematic universe and proof that Logan/Hugh Jackman are still going strong.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Atypical superhero movie,"""The Wolverine"" (2013) takes place after ""X-Men 3: The Last Stand"" (2006) and focuses on Logan in Japan. It's reminiscent of Chris Claremont & Frank Miller's original 1982 4-part Wolverine miniseries.Like that miniseries, the film is very atypical for comic book superheroes. It plays out more like a James Bond flick, sort of a modern version of ""You Only Live Twice"", than a conventional superhero flick. Logan (Hugh Jackman) never appears in an outlandish costume, nor do any other characters, except Viper, and hers isn't all that outlandish.The beginning is great -- the World War II prologue and the Yukon sequences. I also enjoyed the Japanese locations and culture, as well as the focus on drama mixed with stellar bouts of comic book action. Unfortunately, I found the story only moderately interesting, which is the main reason I rate the film as mediocre as I do. It just isn't all that captivating.I really liked the character of Yukio (Rila Fukushima), and Hiroyuki Sanada makes a quality antagonist, but I found Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) rather bland. The Silver Samurai also appears in an armored suit a la Iron Man or War Machine and comes across as typical for this type of fare.In addition, Famke Janssen appears as Jean Grey. She's fine in the role, but she never tripped my trigger. The best lookin' woman in the entire film, believe it or not, is the cashier who talks to Logan briefly in Yukon.I'll be honest with you, I thought 2009's ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" was better than this one. Despite the cartoony opening, it had more depth and was way more compelling. Still, ""The Wolverine"" is a solid depiction of Wolverine's adventures in Japan.The film runs 2 hours and 6 minutes.GRADE: C+ or B-",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good entertainment!,"I went into the movie banking on my prior liking for James Mangold's work (Knight & Day, Copland)and the Japanese setting. After watching the movie I was pretty pleased with the effort put in! i.e.the story besides some late twist was kinda old school but neatly handled. Furthermore, dialogs were good (much better than the first part!), acting kind-of ranged from fair to good, character development was fine and action sequences were also quite nicely done!That said there were hardly any moments where I got distracted and that is some feat since the movie features a runtime of more than 2 hours.It seems to be getting clearer with time why so many Wolverine fans had a fallout with this movie. Prior to its release the film was said to be based on the respected Wolverine comic to date, maybe those who read it found the movie to be seriously falling short of it; I never read it so I couldn't spot the differences i.e. if there were some. Secondly, almost all of the talk between Japanese characters (which amounts to more than 90%) in the movie is in Japanese which I believe is the right thing to do but may be this turned out to be a turn off!Nonetheless, The Wolverine is much better than its predecessor and with reviews being heavily polarized on this one, the viewer better check it out.

Spends too much time trying to be a drama,"How can a movie about Wolverine fighting ninjas and giant robots be boring? I don't know, but it is. The Wolverine spends so much time trying to be a drama that it forgets that it's an action film based on a comic book.

A little underrated; this is much better than the eponymous hero's first solo outing but nowhere near as good as his last.,"Though the final confrontation does get a little silly (no doubt caused by studio interference), this small-scale story features some of the best action in the series, by using less wire-work and keeping it mostly practical, as well as a more realistic tone. Jackman also turns in what was perhaps his best work as the character up until this point. The story is appropriately tragic and was, at the time of its release, arguably the closest the character came to being 'comic accurate' on the big-screen, sans yellow suit (aside from its deleted scene, of course.) You can really see what they were going for here and when it works, it really works. The 'Unleashed Extended Edition' on Blu-Ray adds a lot to the experience, with additional blood and violence bringing the violence closer to the original intent. It does feel like a lite version of 'Logan (2017)', but in no way reaches the quality of that, while still being tethered to the studio's idea of what a commercially viable 'X-men' film 'should' be. It's an entertaining and interesting film, all the way until it's rather clunky and disappointing finale, but it still remains leagues better than the eponymous hero's first solo outing and is, I think, a little underrated. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Pass the Popcorn review,"After the disappointing X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Hugh Jackman is back on the big screen reprising his famous Wolverine role. 'The Wolverine' was initially meant to be directed by Darren Aronofsky - he even re-wrote the screenplay and aimed for a R-rating. However, after his departure, we got James Mangold's PG-13 version of 'The Wolverine'. Which is really a shame, since a movie like this truly deserves a R-rating. 'The Wolverine' surely is better than the aforementioned movies, but that isn't saying much. The movie is still underwhelming and full of flaws, the PG-13 rating being one of them.'The Wolverine' continues where X-Men: The Last Stand ended. Logan aka Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who now looks like Jesus, feels guilty about killing Jean Grey aka Phoenix (Famke Janssen). He aimlessly lives his life and often has visions of Jean. One day he meets Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a somewhat strange Japanese girl who invites him to Japan to visit his old friend Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) because he is dying. There, because of some Sci-Fi mumbo jumbo, Logan is deprived of his superpowers. Weakened like that, he is forced to fight yakuza, samurai, ninjas and other Japanese stuff, while seeking a way to regain his superpowers and trying to solve the mystery surrounding the Yashida family.Due to the 2 hours length and poor editing, 'The Wolverine' is a quite boring movie. It is shot in intervals: first, there are pretty long intervals where nothing significant happens, and then this are compensated with intervals of too long action scenes. This kind of editing made the movie feel tiresome. Furthermore, 'The Wolverine' has a serious villain problem. There are just too many of them, and the majority are left completely undeveloped. The screenwriters should have left one or two of them out of the movie, and focus more on the rest. Also, the love story between Logan and Yashida's daughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) was completely uncalled for and made little sense in the movie's story. Logan had much more chemistry with Yukio than with Mariko and she should have been Logan's new love interest, in case he absolutely needed one. Besides, establishing Logan's guilt because of the murder of his love, Jean, is useless if during the course of the movie he bones the first sexy Asian chick he meets. And of course, like I said before, in the world of samurai, katanas and wolverine claws, a R-rating and some Tarantino-esque violence is a must.Still, all of this doesn't mean that 'The Wolverine' is an absolute failure. I liked how the movie has a more serious, darker tone, than the Origins movie. The mystery regarding the Yashida family was also plausible (in spite of some obvious twists) and some jokes in the movie weren't as bad as one might expect. I particularly enjoyed the first act of the movie, before it went dull. 'The Wolverine' surely isn't disastrous, it has its good moments from time to time. I think it will satisfy the majority of its audience, especially the ones who were utterly disappointed with the Origins movie. Actually, it was quite nice to see Logan have some limitations and still fight his enemies. it would have been even nicer if his enemies were somewhat better written.Rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Best Wolverine Movie Yet!,"I have no idea how to write a review for a superhero movie, but I thought that The Wolverine was a good enough film to warrant an attempt.The Wolverine keeps you on the edge of your seat for nearly every second of the film. After an atomic set of dream sequences where Logan witnesses the bombing of Nagasaki in World War Two, we find Logan living in the forest, in what is wrongly identified as ""present-day Alaska"" by New York Times critic A.O Scott. It is clearly the Yukon Canada, as identified by The Yukon Sportsman's Paradise sign in an early scene. Having abandoned his life as a crime fighter, it doesn't take long before the action starts, and Logan gets drawn back into his old kick-ass ways.Very early the film departs North America for Japan, and stays there for the rest of the time. The sets designs are spectacular, the photography obviously expensive and flawless. Shots of everything Japanese give the film an exotic flare, which then of course allows for every single character to be a martial arts expert. The fights scenes are visibly momentous, the special effects outstanding.There are some gut-wrenching flaws though that are hard to stomach amidst the film's greatness: Logan and his side-kick Yukio are both highlighted riding motorcycles through the snow in the middle of Japanese winter; the sexy Viper villain has no discernible point as a character, neither do her costumes; the scene from the trailer where Logan is standing smoking his trademark cigar disappointingly does not appear in the film.Yet the overarching theme dealing with Logan's angst causing immortality is interesting enough to easily redeem the film. Wolverine doesn't save the world here, but he fights to protect the life of one woman, and ends up fighting just to save his own.More reviews drumgodchris.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
MY REVIEW: The Wolverine Once Again,"The Wolverine. Our hunk Hugh Jackman starring as Logan in its 6th outing still carries his charm as he carries his claws. This time he is in Japan saving his new Japanese lady love from ninja warriors. Set in dark set pieces, first half has little to offer to excite the audience except for the fight cum survival sequence on a bullet train. But second half quickly joins the missing pieces giving the movie its purpose and Hugh Jackman some scenes where he can be punch the bad guys with charming arrogance. The twist in the end is good but doesn't hit you hard. Overall, it won't disappoint Wolverine fans but it lacks the fun that we have whenever Logan fights the bad guys with his fellow mutants. To keep the excitement alive, there is one post end credits sequence hinting about the new threat for X-MEN.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Good, summer-action flick with character introspection, and a few gaping holes","The Wolverine does not attempt to be too many things at once, but what you expect from it, or want, will dictate how distracting the plot holes are which will in the end determine your enjoyment level. Unless you are seeking fault, or seeking Oscar worthy attributes, all others should find redemption and enjoyment in the movie.Hugh Jackman once again reprises the title character and he conveys the angst, apathy, and attitude admirably at various points throughout the film. He suffers only slightly at how the character is written to be portrayed, to which I do not hold him accountable.Mariko, Yukio and even Harada are played well with Yukio earning the gold both acting-wise, and the most depth to the character. Harada seems to suffer with the direction of his character, but this can be attributed to a character flaw rather than storyline error if one wants. Mariko plays off the strength, individuality, and tempered vulnerability adeptly, but is surprisingly written fairly flat, impeding one aspect of the storyline.The villains are sadly underdeveloped making it hard to a)understand motivations, b)care about the endgame. It doesn't help that both of those two things are the largest storyline plot holes both in design and execution.In the end, buying into Logan's self-evaluation, growth, and emotions is done best by watching the main character in the moments between action, and not best served with the in your face 'dream' sequences. The action and the impact the storyline has on Wolverine physically is inconsistent, but the emotional depth within him rather than playing off others is the strength of the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I didn't LOVE it but I did LIKE it!,"Do you like the X-Men story from the movies? Are you hyped for the upcoming and long awaited X4? if the answer is yes to either then you have to go watch it. I think that too many people went into this film looking for a blood bath instead of looking for a movie that dealt with how Logan deals with Jean's death and how he picks himself up again and once again decides to go on.I really enjoyed the movie and I am an X-Men comic guy the company I went with also found it very enjoyable. The movie has some really good humour. Watch the usual extra scene at the end because it was EPIC!!! one of the guy who went with me said that scene alone was worth the 3D ticket price and he thought the movie was OK(he wanted more ragemode lol).Overall the best movie out there right now, I'm assuming that you have watched all the summer blockbusters to date.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Tribute to a Praiseworthy Culture,"After the delightful X-Men: First Class, a Wolverine spin-off movie, set in Japan was quite unexpected, bearing in mind the regrettable X-Men: Origins - Wolverine.As mentioned, the plot takes place (mostly) in Japan, keeping the prominence of the Japanese culture constantly emphasized. All well-known cliches appear, from the typical cherry blossom trees, to the remarkable katanas, and the famous doctrine of the samurai. Although the tradition of Japan is perfectly displayed, the notorious identity of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) seems to have lost on the way.As the story unfolds, Wolverine encounters many unknown people, and acts unusually friendly with them. It's really surprising (and sometimes unconvincing) to see the submissive, and accepting side of the character, especially if we remember his furious temper when he first met the X-Men.The other main characters are fairly solid, though not always comprehensible. The likable character of the princess, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), accompanied by the agreeable Yukio (Rila Fukushima) were grateful roles, nonetheless the actual treasure was the character of Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi/Ken Yamamura), who shakes up the otherwise tepid tale.The glamorous environment of Japan makes the moderately dull story acceptable, even so it can't help the film of being a non mandatory piece of the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Loved the twists and turns,"Honestly speaking I have followed almost all the superheroes from the MARVEL excluding XMEN series. I had no idea about the storyline of the movie nor do I knew about the characters and the cast. Hugh Jackman was the sole reason I went for the movie and there was no disappointment. The movie was full of action scenes and many twists and turns which made it extremely enjoyable. Even when wolverine is not as powerful as other superheroes , the kind of character that Hugh brought in the wolverine looked extremely powerful.This was my first XMEN series watch and I am definitely looking forward to watch the previous parts now. Totally worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not a bad film but not a great one either,"As the comic book cinematic universes continue to expand it is difficult to keep up. Whether a film is a sequel, prequel, reboot, parallel story or a hybrid of what has come before, is almost mind boggling.As the most successful character of the X-Men series, it always made financial sense for the man with the steel claws as ""Logan"" or ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman), to keep coming back for more.This time we are transported back to just before the atomic bomb is dropped in Nagasaki 1945. Japanese officer ""Yashida"" (Ken Yamamura) instead of committing ritual suicide (Sepukku) along with his colleagues, opens all of the American prisoners cell doors, giving them a doomed opportunity to escape.Deciding he is worth saving, Logan persuades his captor to dive into a pit and then shields him from the conflagration, using his indestructible body.Fast forward to the present day and we find a troubled Logan waking post nightmare in bed with ""Jean Grey"" (Famke Janssen), all is not what it seems and suddenly we find the bedraggled Logan in the Yukon. With echoes of ""Jean Valjean"" from ""Les Miz"" still haunting Jackman in this mode of dress, you will be pleased to hear singing is not on the menu.Logan is an angry man and soon finds an opportunity for a bar room fight, when local hunters treat their prey with no respect. Before he can do his thing, he meets ""Yukio"" (Rila Fukushima) a young red headed Japanese woman brandishing a Samuari sword known as the ""Seperator"" for obvious reasons.Before you can say, neatly choreographed fight scene in local ale house, we are whisked off to Japan. The man he saved many years ago, ""Yashida"" wants to say goodbye. Of course there is an ulterior motive involving robbing Wolverine of his regenerative powers to save the older man thus allowing Logan to finally become mortal.The plot thickens when the beautiful daughter ""Mariko"" (Tao Okamoto) appears on the scene and clearly needs Logans help, all is not well in the state of Denmark, or in this case, Tokyo.The film attempts to broaden and deepen the role but does overall feel like a nod to current movie demographics, setting itself in Asia. The story as it unfolds, is unnecessarily complicated and towards the conclusion, teeters dangerously towards ""Transformers"" type territory with unintentional comedic moments.The CGI especially towards the denouement is a bit ropey and what with Yakuza, lots of disposable henchmen dressed in black and sets that look, just like sets, the strive for realism takes a hit.Jackman is as solid as ever, muscles popping and rippling like Mr Universe with Swiss army knives for hands. The supporting cast are just that, supporting and add little to the story or characterisations. At least this time we get Wolverine centre stage throughout the film with only minimal extra mutants popping up.The prologue is perhaps the most interesting segment of the film but like X-Men before, some might question the use of this thematic element as a backdrop in a mainstream comic book film.SummaryNot a bad film but not a great one either. Wolverine is still searching for that one good solo film he surely deserves.Solid entertainment but overall aiming high yet falling somewhat short of director James Mangold's Japanese based vision for Wolverine.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not what I was hoping for,"The beginning and end were good, but the rest of the movie was horrible. Wolverine got his rear end kicked the whole movie. If I wanted to watch a drama, I would have rented one. W is supposed to be a tough super hero that dominates his enemies, not some drama queen with a broken nail. At least the end gave notion to a sequel, which better be on an action film or I am done with W. Waste of money and time. What where the creators thinking?Wolverine couldn't fight worth a darn, gets his blades cut off, he might as well been a mortal. Maybe that was the point, but it made me think worse of him not better. I was hoping that the final fight was going to make up for the lack of good action, but all it did was annoy me. This movie was a complete let down and I wouldn't waist any money to watch it. Wait until it airs on HBO you can get it for a Dollar on Red Box before you watch whatever comes after.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Warning for Parents,"As fun as this movie is, don't be misled by its PG-13 rating. The ""F-Bomb"" is dropped quite often in this film along with other words of the obscene variety. If you can duct tape your children's ears, they will love the visuals which fortunately are fairly bloodless. Otherwise, this is a comic book come to life with Hugh Jackman channeling Clint Eastwood and following the standard Marvel script of a mighty industrialist/genius either using his powers for Good or surrendering to the Dark Side. The ending, in which we are treated to some sort of Samurai-Voltran almost ruined the movie but not quite. Check your brain at the door, ogle at Jackman's ripped physique and enjoy the ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
positively surprised,"""The Wolverine"" has everything that one superhero movie should have. Good acting, plenty of action, effects, story, plot, imagination, super powers... It just spontaneously gets your attention while watching and the feeling is similar to the one when playing a good video game. It makes you get into the spirit so much. Hugh Jackman and beautiful Tao Okamoto in the main roles did their job the best that ones could've done.There's no movie to compare it with. E.g. New Batman movies are too realistic and serious for a superhero movies. ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" movie series looks promising and the first part was really good, but plot and story are a bit less complex. ""Avengers"" are too childish for my taste.Everything is done as it should be and you can really notice main members of the crew made this movie from the heart. Long story short, perfectly made! It just got my attention from the very begin and kept it until the black screen with list of crew members showed up. I have never enjoyed that much watching one superhero movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why bother?,"The Wolverine is a competent movie but not special in any way. The acting is okay. The special effects are okay. The story is okay.

The twists are somewhat predictable. At times you might think you're watching Pacific Rim, a Transformers movie or even The Matrix. Those comparisons aren't compliments but point out how this movie feels formulaic.If you like the X-Men, you might as well watch this movie too. Otherwise, you can safely ignore it.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best superhero movie of the summer,This is by far one of the best of the saga. I was on the edge of my seat enjoying ever scene and ill I g every second of this movie. I can't wait in the future of more films with Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine.It has a tight script focusing on Logan as The Wolverine and no so much the X Men. If people were looking for X Men 4 they are not going to see it here. Its better. Logan is his own story and thats what they focused on and thats why I liked it. The major villain in this film isn't the Ninja's or Silver Sam it's Logan himself. If you cant see that then watch it again as a stand alone film not as a film attached to the X Men franchise. Its a look into Logan and why he is who he is.What I really liked also is that this one stays true to the comics. The Japanese arc of the comics is easily Wolverine's best story and this movie delivers more than justice! Overall I would say best superhero movie of the summer.,9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pretty much disappointing compared to the other X-Men universe films.,"If you're looking for another X-Men movie, you will be disappointed. Simply because this isn't a X-Men movie. It's a Wolverine-Movie.But even then you might still get disappointed. Most of the movie is watching Wolverine get his bottom kicked by virtually everyone. The story didn't really convince me, it just seemed like the studio wanted to make quick money using the (over?)hyped iconic clawed mutant. Though there were some good plot-twists, I didn't have the feeling the story was rounded-up well and had any major point. Perhaps I'm missing something, but the lesson Logan seems to have learned during this movie could have been learned any other way and was in no correlation to the plot. Yes, I know Logan killed Jean in X-Men: Last Stand and sought solitude, but I still don't see why this movie was necessary.Especially the post-credit scene actually showed how much out of context this movie was. The other X-Men universe movies show stories and events relevant to the overall plot and general understanding of the X-Men universe. Well, this one doesn't. You literally can not watch it and there wouldn't be any piece of relevant info you'd miss.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Some of Logan's scars never heal...,"The X-men franchise is back on top form as we finally get the film that we wanted X-Men Origins: Wolverine to be. Whilst Origins stood as a film that repressed key characters like Wolverine and Deadpool (he's called the merc with a mouth for a reason) The Wolverine takes us to the animal, scarred and adamantium core of an amazing character, taking him to new levels unseen on screen before.This success is in great part due to Jackman's incredible return to the role as he once again brings his A game to make the comic book character come to life on screen. Within it, Jackman brings just the right level emotion to the character with the events of Last Stand still haunting him and unable to live life the way he once did. The films plot allows great range to Wolverine as we get to see him both at his weakest, being inches from death and at his strongest where he holds back the least.While elements of the screenplay does have it's downfalls such as lack of character depth for the leading villains, this is more than made up for through the sheer depth finally given to Wolverine to allow for a more detailed version of the character than seen before. Also part of me would have liked to see more mutants within the plot with only around 4- 5 mutants appearing on screen. But after Origins that may not necessarily be a bad thing...Another great part of the film is we once again see James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma, Walk the Line) take the directing wheel, which he does terrifically not holding back from the source material and showing Logan as the powerful beast that he can be through terrific fight scenes such as a funeral fight and a train scene. He demonstrates how he doesn't hold back after opening first scene where we witness Nagasaki and the sheer destruction of an atomic bomb showing to us the audience the films realistic tone and that they'll have a blast of a time! (Sorry, couldn't resist the pun.)This is definitely a different film from all other films in the X-men franchise, taking a darker turn to allow a better reflection to better display Wolverine. But despite differences, it serves as a strong addition to the franchise and despite some differences remains loyal to the original The Wolverine comics. Thus this is a must see for any Wolverine fans as it makes the best adaption of the character seen yet. But if you need any other I'll simply say after credits sequence, STAY FOR IT.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A huge improvement,"This is much better than the 2009 ""X Men Origins"". It has an onward momentum, involving characters and an exotic story set in Japan with a bit of WWII. Wolverine protects a Japanese friend's daughter.Liked the seaside setting in Nagasaki and the Tokyo villa. The mostly Asian cast is good from Korean American Will Yun Lee to the two different but attractive Japanese actresses: the lovely model like Tao Okamoto as Mariko and Rila Fukushima as a feisty sidekick. Hiroyuki Sanada from Revenge plays Marikos evil father.The action sequences aren't tedious. Liked the bullet train scene. The various martial arts sword fighting and arrow sequences are clearly done. If there had been any more fights it would have been repetitive. Only the last part was a bit too overblown. Unfortunately the Famke Jansen flashbacks are a bit annoying - she is getting a bit old for the flashbacks. Didn't really need to have the Japanese girl and gaijin hookup.Hugh Jackman still is fine in his tough role despite the passage of time and puts a lot of effort and intensity into it.Overall if you are thinking of giving this one a miss it would be a mistake. This is a worthwhile summer blockbuster to see on the big screen.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Showdown in Tokyo,"Although focusing on the titular character, this is a direct sequel to the original trilogy from the two thousands. The hero goes on a new adventure, one that is rooted deeply in his past and may help him change his life for the better. Unfortunately, the part of the movie that is between the prologue and the third act is problematic. Again, the movie focuses on one specific character and what he's going through, and there are no apocalyptic events coming yet, but there are some huge things at work, like the government or the crime world and so on, and the movie struggles to handle these things and the intricate intrigues that come from them, and even the action scenes do not really help here. It's like the movie wants to be more than just entertainment, it's like it wants to be something deeply serious, but doesn't really have what it takes. Fortunately, though, the hero's particular journey here works, and again, once things are clear enough and it's time for the big final showdowns, the movie works just fine.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Wolverine has Wolverine doing what he does best, slashing","I enjoyed this film, but then I enjoyed X-Men Origins: Wolverine as well. Though for different reasons obviously. That one was fun and I enjoyed seeing the different mutants they incorporated into the story, but at the end of the day it was a bit cheesy. This one is of a more serious tone, but this one seems more like a gateway film that was made to lead up to the super big X-men film coming out in 2014. Basically, putting the films on their course as it reestablishes the films are indeed all tied together with the exception of the origins one. So the first three films then First Class are connected. Though I do feel this film was made in part to set up next year's film, the darker tone and the setting made it a good film to me and better than Wolverine's last solo outing.The story has Logan still struggling with the fact he ended Jean Grey's life in The Last Stand. He is living an isolated existence in the wilderness of Canada; however, a young girl named Yukio finds him and asks that he comes to Japan as the person she works for is dying and one of his wishes is to see the man that rescued him during World War II. Logan reluctantly agrees and soon learns that the man did not wish to merely say his goodbyes to Logan, but to offer Logan the chance to live a normal life then die as he wants Logan's mutant ability to heal for himself. Well Logan refuses, but there are more things going on as the old man's granddaughter is targeted by the Japanese mafia, a strange mutant named Viper seems to have her own agenda and Logan's healing abilities disappear. Logan must protect the granddaughter and learn to once again become The Wolverine in order to survive the many perils that await him.The film is rated PG-13, but it probably only needs a couple of more things added to be an R. I find it strange that The Conjuring did get an R, but was not have as bad as this film as far as violence and language. The film has good action as I enjoy watching Hugh Jackman portray Wolverine; however, the story at times gets a bit to convoluted as this person is really working for that person or this man is the one that is trying to kill the other person. Thankfully, though the story is passable enough to lead to some great shots and scenes. The Silver Samurai was pretty cool at the end and also make sure to wait for an nice ending scene after a few of the credits pass. This scene does so much more than the one seen at the end of Iron Man 3 as it actually establishes something.So I enjoyed Wolverine's second solo outing, though at some point I wish they would spend a bit more time with some of the other X-Men (granted, they did that a bit with First Class). I enjoyed the setting of this one more as I enjoyed the overall feel of this film to Origins. I also liked that this film establishes that The Last Stand happened and this was not yet another quick reboot. I am very much looking forward to the next X-Men film, but it was nice to see everybody's favorite mutant slash and stab his way back into theaters.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not stupid, but a disappointment","At some point in this movie it becomes clear that it's just a concatenation of set pieces. It's not even the Wolverine character we've seen so far. He's kinda boring, never as much of a smart-ass as in the X-Men or even the Origin movie. Also The Wolverine is missing a real baddie. The mutants (Viper, actually a snake woman, here more of a Poison Ivy character) are not that present. The Japan setting never really shines. The film misses a lot of opportunities for great cinematography. There are little moment though! Hugh Jackman standing on top of a building while it's raining. Suddenly it feels like Blade Runner. That's cool but totally out of place here. Also the guest appearances by Famke Janssen as Jean Grey are stupid. Not that it doesn't fit in this story but you NEED to watch X-Men: The Last Stand before this ""Stand-Alone"" to understand why she's here. While X-Men: Origins - Wolverine was just stupid, this is a disappointment.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A well-deserved Japanese vacation for the Wolverine!,"'X-men Origins Wolverine' was an entertaining film, admittedly, but it was a deeply flawed movie that ultimately didn't do the character or his origin story enough justice. 'The Wolverine', Fox's (and Hugh Jackman's) second attempt to give the character a solo adventure, does rectify a lot of those flaws, and ends up as a good film (maybe even a very good one)...but it just falls short of 'great'.The movie undoubtedly has its strengths. It treats the character and the source material seriously, adopting a dark noir-ish tone befitting Wolverine and more specifically the 'Japanese saga' it is based on. Logan's inner struggle with his immortality, and his lack of purpose, are perfectly illustrated, and resolved. The supporting cast, including the members of the Yashida clan (Master Yashida, Shingen and Mariko), Harada, and of course, Yukio, are near-perfect. Viper proves to be a chilling antagonist (though nowhere near the level of Brian Cox's William Stryker, Ian McKellan's Magneto, or even Liev Schreiber's Victor Creed!) The cinematography is breath-taking-from the opening scenes in the Canadian wilderness to the alleyways of Tokyo.But where the movie disappoints, to a large extent, is in its plot structure. What could have been an pure atmospheric Japanese noir drama/action flick, ends up getting 'polluted' with clichéd superhero and thriller tropes such as lost superpowers, 'secret identities' and 'surprise' twists. Instead of being the definitive Wolverine story, this movie ends up being a darn good superhero story...but certainly nothing close to the likes of The Dark Knight or The Avengers.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""The Wolverine"" is a top 5 superhero flick","I found ""The Wolverine"" to be a refreshingly different superhero movie. Most of the time, superheros greatly lack any kind of theme other than the typical guy-saves-world plot, and they use huge budgets to create spectacles that, when held to higher movie standards, simply aren't spectacular. This movie keeps the budget, but focuses much more on the eponymous ""Wolverine"" as a human being dealing with the consequences of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" and on the consequences of his abilities: he can experience all the pain in the world but, unlike the rest of us, death is not a way out for him.This movie is a character study on ""The Wolverine,"" and the plot, the villain, and the characters all exist to frame Logan's unique circumstance, his history, and his state-of-mind. The very fact that this movie has an overarching theme, in this movie about living life and the meaning of having or lacking immortality, immediately put this movie head-and-shoulders above almost every superhero movie I have ever seen.Which isn't to say it doesn't have flaws. The ""villain"" of the movie, if you can call him/her that, is a non-character whose role or motivation is never established. Many seemingly important characters are incredibly one-dimensional and their decisions can seem arbitrary and lacking in depth. The story takes place in Japan, and some of the ""culture-shock"" parts of the story are stereotypical. Japanese culture is sometimes used to describe away legitimate plot-holes. The romantic interest is forced and didn't seem to be in keeping with Logan's character or the story itself.But I excuse all of these issues simply because the premise of story is interesting, the plot maintains the theme, and the conclusion is satisfying (if a little predictable). The action sequences are more sparse in this action film, but they are less about spectacle and more about combat-- expect to see acrobatics and hand-to-hand combat rather than big guns and huge explosions. It also has significantly fewer places where deus ex machina save the day; something movies like Thor 2 and Man of Steel had all over the place.So if you have an attention span and you appreciate a little complexity to the theme of a movie, you will enjoy this film as I did, and forgive its imperfections. If not, move along-- there's no lack of action- packed-but-lacking-any-point movies from which to choose from.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dumbest movie I've ever seen.,"And believe me, I'm not picky on action movie. And I love Hugh Jackman. But this movie is just NOT likable, at all. Stupid plot, dumb action, CGI-overloaded boring characters, bad acting, and very very very heavy Japanese accents. I don't think I need to point out any more flaws of this movie - just see through the previous comments. I just want to assure you that all the negative comments ARE true. The plot doesn't only have holes, it can leave you in an amazement that someone actually made a plot like that into a movie. The hero hardy did anything. The acting of two Japanese actresses in this movie is really bad, or I'd rather say ""overdone"", with a ""I'm a mysterious Asian girl"" feeling, hope you know what I mean. And all those Japanese things are forced into the movie. Seriously, as a Japan-lover, I even felt insulted at some points. The only good thing about this movie is Hugh Jackman's face, and while we're at it, let's say his abs too. Don't waste your money on this garbage.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pussy Wolverine vs Ninjas in Japan,There are decent scenes of action that save the movie and move it up to a five but there are some major flaws.First is who is the bad guy? It seems like the lizard woman was but there were hardly 3 scenes with her in it and maybe a couple more with her being there for 10-20 seconds.Then they spend what feels like an hour hour developing a love interest and the pay off is a kiss then she gets taken away.This is just a personal gripe but I go to wolverine movies to watch action and wolverine just be all around over powered compared to the humans he fights. This movie was different though in a what might have seemed as a good plot device got no explanation besides an image of a bug robot.,5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Steel vs Adamantium- scintillating clash,"There is a reason the X Men in the movies are best in a team- none of them are charismatic enough to pull a movie on their own. Except perhaps Wolverine. The very extension of this tortured loner's superpowers is cause for incomparable pain. And his immortality which means living forever with the choices that one makes, can be a curse too. While the 2009 wolverine origins movie was a cartoonish effort, this one though draws from one of the most inspirational arcs in the Wolverine comics lore- the 1983 Claremont/Miller miniseries.Japan's importance may be declining in the world, but Hollywood's fascination with Japan only seems to be rising. Couple of weeks back it was Pacific Rim, and this week it is Wolverine. The time-line is somewhere after the events of X Men Last Stand. Wracked with guilt over killing Jean Grey, Logan renounces his world saving days, he retreats into the Alaskan mountains, to befriend the occasional grizzly, take on errant hunters, stay away from hair and care products and chit chatting with Jean's ghost. His miserable existence takes an unexpected turn when he summoned to Japan by someone whose life he had saved during the Nagasaki bombing in the second world war. Yashida, a humble army commandant then, is now the most powerful man in Japan spearheading an industrial conglomerate. Yashida offers Logan the chance to let go of his superpowers so that he can lead a normal life. Logan refuses but anyways loses his regenerative powers, and quickly gets entangled into a web of blood and deception involving everything Japan- ninjas, yakuzas, katanas, martial arts, bullet trains and steel.This is Hugh Jackman's sixth turn at this character and he looks positively tired, but powers up whenever the action demands. The Japanese characters are stereotype Asian, while the only other mutant in the movie is slinky as a viper. Director James Mangold tries to stick close to the source, with a number of shots that are straight off the graphic comic book's panels. Logan needing a bodyguard takes some time to sink in, while the humor is mostly derived from his devil may care attitude. There is plenty of action though, with Logan slicing off yakuzas and ninjas an intermittent feature. The sequence on top of the bullet train particularly energetic, along with a climactic fight to the finish with the Silver Samurai.As a theme Wolverine eschews global annihilation and explosive set pieces in favor of an intimate take. Think of this as a samurai movie, with the hero wielding adamantium instead of steel. To put things into perspective, the only explosion in the entire movie is the one at the start at Nagasaki, and that too is pictured at a distance. Wolverine in a way is the picture the character always deserved- aptly showcasing his torment, inner struggles and his quest for the meaning of his life. This is more than just popcorn entertainment, it is a solid action thriller. Those seeking a world threatening tale need to wait for the post credits scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The character of Yukio was amazing.,"I went to see The Wolverine expecting to see some sword fighting and martial arts fighting by the women. I was not disappointed. I especially liked the character of Yukio who was played by Rila Fukushima. I think she was just as good in the film as the Wolverine or Logan. She is smart, witty, funny, and has a great personality. She also doesn't just use her sword, but can fight as well. She has martial arts ability. She seems to enjoy her human abilities and capabilities much more than her precognitive mutant abilities. I recommend this movie if you want to see a lot of strong female characters. I've liked the x men series because all the female characters have something to offer. They are all beautiful and have something to offer in each film, at least that I can remember. Whether they have some mutant capability or not. I would recommend purchasing this film to see the character of Yukio and I don't think you will feel disappointed in what I say. Especially if you like strong female supporting roles.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Dull plotting negates the movie's virtues,"Pity poor Logan, aka The Wolverine, that immortal lycanthropic mutant with retractable adamantine claws played by that Jack-of-all-trades entertainer Hugh Jackman. All Logan wants is to be left alone to live as a hermit, spending his boundless days working as a logger, brooding over his condition and occasionally talking to the dead wife he accidentally killed who shows up occasionally to convince him to do away with himself and join her on the other side (apparently, she doesn't quite get this whole ""immortality"" thing).But like Michael Corleone in ""Godfather III,"" every time Logan thinks he's out, someone pulls him back in. In ""The Wolverine,"" that person is a sword-wielding Japanese seer (Rila Fukushima) who convinces Logan to travel to Japan to say goodbye to the aged and dying Japanese prison guard whose life Logan saved during the bombing of Nagasaki. But things are never quite as simple as they seem in the movies, and soon Logan finds himself involved with the Yakuza, ninja warriors, the man's beautiful young granddaughter (Tao Okamoto) and some pretty messy intra-family politics.Though it features some impressive sword fighting and some cool mano-a-mano fisticuffs atop a Japanese bullet-train, ""The Wolverine"" ultimately feels empty and half-hearted, a soulless exercise done in by longwinded speechifying and mediocre plotting. Better luck next installment.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
3 interesting lessons from the movie,"Just watch the movie and it did give me 3 lessons 1. The Earth is a round, we can meet again at some point in the future. But the time is a line, so never expect your friend be the same person as he used to be 2. Beauty is always a perfect trap that can fool any man. 3. TRUST NO ONE!! The story is good and it did surprise me. In the beginning, i have thought that it was too simple, but in the end, it was not. There is some funny moments in the movie, you can laugh for sure. The open ending could mean that this series will continue. I expect to see more mutants in one movie. One thing that i am keep asking after watching this movie. At the end,how could they manage to get out the house with many skilled ninja in there?",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better than Origins, but still not good.","There's a fight on top of a train and it's pretty awesome. That said, most of everything else just doesn't add up to an exciting, riveting movie. It's better than Origins.For the record, my X-men knowledge is not spectacular. I have the gist, I own and have read a couple of the comics, I've seen all the movies and I've watched the animated series, most of them, except for the ""Wolverine and the X-men"" cartoon. I went into this movie with just a general idea of what it was supposed to be about. Wolverine in Japan.I assumed that any story about Wolverine in Japan featuring a woman with daddy/grandaddy issues would be about Yuriko.Ah... but they already did Yuriko in X2, right?This movie is not about Yuriko.I repeat, this movie is not about Yuriko.Even when you start to think about Yuriko, because that's inevitable, really, keep in mind that it's not about Yuriko. The girl does not end up with claws. Nor does she end up part cyborg. Her name is MAriko, not YUriko. Different people.Now focusing on what the movie actually is about...Well, honestly, it's not about anything really. What you see in the trailer is what you get mostly. There are ninjas, a giant samurai robot, a Japanese girl who's very Japanese, another Japanese girl who's the love interest, a lot of sword-fighting, some more ninjas, a man with a crossbow...There are two mutants aside from Wolverine, both have very lame powers. nothing to get excited about. Wolverine spends a lot of time getting shot, and there's a lot of sword-fighting. A whole lot of sword- fighting. And ninjas with arrows... Lots and lots of ninjas... And warning to the parents, it's not very kid friendly.If you're a fan of X-men, because you like that magical thrill of seeing people do awesome unbelievable stuff like bend metal with their minds, fly, freeze time, control the weather, shoot lasers from their eyes/arms, teleport in a puff of blue smoke, etc, then this movie isn't for you.If you're a die-hard Wolverine fan though, and you don't care about the plot as long as Hugh Jackman is on the screen growling, then yay this!And there's a fight in/on a train that almost makes the whole thing worthwhile.

Still not the perfectly ideal 'Wolverine' film but it's a damn good one!,"'THE WOLVERINE': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The sixth 'X-MEN' film and second revolving around the popular Marvel superhero Wolverine. Hugh Jackman launched his movie star career playing the character (and is now the third highest paid actor in Hollywood), here he plays the role for the sixth time (counting a cameo in 'X-MEN: FIRST CLASS'). The movie takes place multiple years after all the other 'X-MEN' films and revolves around Wolverine traveling to Japan to meet a former soldier he saved from a nuclear blast, during World War II, who's now on his deathbed. He finds his healing powers severely suppressed as he must battle well trained samurai and a sexy mutant femme fatale with an immunity to poisons. The film is not only vastly superior to the last 'WOLVERINE' film, 'X-MEN ORIGINS', but it's also an extremely impressive superhero action film given it's the sixth installment in it's franchise.The film begins in a flashback of 1945 when Wolverine (Jackman), also known as Logan, is being held in a Japanese POW camp near Nagasaki, as it suffers an atomic bombing. He rescues a Japanese officer named Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) who several decades later (during present day) calls on Wolverine for help (at his deathbed). Logan is living alone in the Yukon where he's haunted by nightmares of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen reprising her role), who he had to kill at the end of the film 'X-MEN: THE LAST STAND', when a mutant working for Yashida, named Yukio (Rila Fukushima), comes looking for him. She convinces him to come with her to Japan to say goodbye to Yashida before he passes on. Once there Yashida tries to convince Logan to give him his healing powers and live the normal life he always wanted to (as he explains he knows how to transfer his special abilities from one body to another). Logan refuses but finds his powers weakened the next day anyway. He then must battle ruthless samurai and a seductive poisonous mutant who spits poison, called Viper (played by the gorgeous Svetlana Khodchenkova), as he struggles to protect Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), from their attack.The film is based on the 1982 limited comic series 'Wolverine' by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller. It was scripted by Mark Bomback, Scott Frank and Christopher McQuarrie and directed by James Mangold. Mangold also directed the hit films 'WALK THE LINE', '3:10 TO YUMA' and 'KATE & LEOPOLD' (also starring Jackman). The movie is action packed, intense and always involving. Jackman is the perfect Wolverine once again and Khodchenkova makes the perfect seductive villain (she's one of my favorite parts of the movie). It's surprisingly dark and somewhat disturbing for a superhero comic book movie. Mangold did an excellent job with the atmosphere and the screenplay was definitely well written. From what I understand it's pretty faithful to the comics (with a few minor changes here and there) and ultimately lives up to what fans want to see for once. While it's not as good as the first two 'X-MEN' films (which are two of my all time favorite movies) or the last installment, 'FIRST CLASS', it is greatly superior to 'X-MEN ORIGINS' and 'THE LAST STAND'. It's still not the perfectly ideal 'Wolverine' film but it's a damn good one!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxMJBjPRxAc",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wolverine's Character Profile!,"Now when X-Men Origins: Wolverine came out in 2009, I was one of the handful who actually enjoyed it despite its flaws. Now flash forward four years later and we get another Wolverine standalone movie, but this time the film takes place after the events of 2006's The Last Stand, which I liked. I also liked how this film is purposely slow as the movie tries to explain the deep feelings of our protagonist and his desire to die. I liked the new direction of the film and while it takes it time, there are several great action scenes and one involving a fight on top of a bullet train.James Mangold's film starts off with The Wolverine saving a Japanese soldier's life during the dropping of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki. Flash forward many years later, Wolverine is living life as a mountain man feeling guilty of Jean Grey's death. When he gets the call to come to Japan, he meets the soldier again who is now an old man near death. The old man offers him a way out of his grief and his immortal being. Now can the Wolverine accept a mortal life?This film does not require a whole slew of A-list stars and we don't get them other than the iconic Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Hugh was fantastic as always and he plays the part well with even more scowls and brooding which we come to expect. Famke Janssen makes several appearances as Wolverine's now deceased love. Two Japanese actresses, Tao Okamoto and Rila Fukushima, are excellent as Wolverine's female companions. The villain of the film, played by Russian actress Svetlana Khodchenkova, was perhaps the weakest part of the film. Her portrayal as Viper was not that convincing.Overall, The Wolverine is an excellent character study of a flawed man full of guilt and is longing for being mortal. Some people complain about how the film is slow and boring. Unfortunately people don't like a personal character study these days. What little action there is, it's pretty impressive. Even if the final action scene is repetitive of films from the past, but it was well done. As a character study, this film excels. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
the most disappointing wolverine movie I have seen,"Unfortunately the very -considerably- good X-men series are culminating in a series of rather disappointing and uninspired wolverine tribute wannabes. This movie leaves so much to be desired, that at some point you cannot help but wonder: ""where are they going with this?"". The answer only reveals itself in the last 3 minutes of the movie, following the first end-credits. I wouldn't want to spoil it for everyone who has not seen the movie yet, so I have this to share: this is a watchable movie, entertaining as far as effects go, filled with plot-holes, leaving you with a taste of ""we-had-to-make-this-movie-as-stipulated-in-our-contract"" in the mouth.

Strong Story to Watch,"'The Wolverine' stars Hugh Jackman, Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Svetlana Khodchenkova. Hugh Jackman is of course great in this film, like he always has been as wolverine. The wolverine is Hugh Jackman. He nails the role in every way. The rest of the cast and the supporting cast also do very well. I had no doubt that any of them were who they portrayed in their role. Svetlana Kohchenkova did really well as the main antagonist in the film. She had that ""bad guy"" feeling that went along with her the whole time. The only problem I have with the acting is that some of the actors overacted their role. They brought the acting too far and it was over the top.The story was also good. It had a clear conflict, adventure, and task at hand for most of the time. When it got to then, it wasn't like that, but the end was only a little part of the film. For most of the film there are certain reasons characters fight, and what they fight for. They have their motivations and their weaknesses. The characters were all very rich. They didn't need to do much character development on wolverine because we know who he is, but they let us know what he is like now. It also developed the other characters well and gave them back stories. 'The Wolverine' was not all about wolverine. It was about the situation at hand and many of the characters. It was still focused, but it didn't stay on one thing the whole time.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

'Everyone You Love Will Die',"..these are the words James mangold wrote on the back of the scripts for 'the wolverine'. Lofty, heavy subject matter indeed. Did he deliver on this? I Think so.Before I review this I want to stress that before you go and watch the film, do not expect to see an x-men film, or an x-men origins: wolverine sequel. It has references to canon established no doubt but this is THE WOLVERINE, singular. Got it? right.I was quite surprised while I was watching this film, as a big fan of Asian cinema and the neo noir stuff they've been doing in Korean cinema for a little while, I found this settle into its aesthetic quite quickly and stands up there (cinematographically, is that a word?) with some of the best. Fair enough, mangold is trying to ape what has come before but he does it with some reverence and the tone is consistent throughout. That is until the final act, which I won't spoil.THE WOLVERINE is more a character drama, a fish out of water story but also one of healing and redemption. Logan (played by Hugh Jackman) really is the focus here and is far and away the best thing in this movie.In one scene that takes place in a Yukon bar, it is no more evident that james mangold has delivered on the 'simmering berserker rage' aspect of the character. There is so much intensity and nuance in Jackman's performance that you actually feel the stakes, that when pushed, wolverine is not a nice guy to be around. This permeated through the entire film and made it a fairly serious piece although it has its share of laughs but just enough levity to remind you of the wolverine we all know and love.The film seeks to answer the question of what makes an, for all intent and purposes 'immortal' want to keep going. Does that person want to keep on going? Is immortality a curse? While the exploration of this isn't as deep as you'd expect, it is handled admirable enough with Logan as the subject matter. The film also (for comic book fans) explores how wolverine is defined by the women in his life. We all know the beauty and the beast aspect to his sorry tale but what if beauty dies, must he continue to seek out more beauty to temper his soul?This films shows enormous restraint, but is also ballsy. Don't go into it expecting just wall to wall mindless CGI action, explosion, witty one liners or cities being destroyed. It's a gritty, deeply explored character drama and what some people will call boring, I would call cultural ignorance.While I agree Asian cinema and culture is not everyones cup of tea, you have to be able to appreciate or at least tolerate it to really understand the films finer points, the sober mood & aesthetic. A third of the film was entirely in Japanese, with a predominantly Japanese cast. In some parts they consciously did not subtitle the dialogue so that the audience were as lost in this culture as Logan was. Do the studio even want to make money from this as a summer tent-pole movie? FOX actually showed some balls taking on this flick and given their history, they can only be commended for taking this risk.Though not as good as batman begins, that feeling you got after you finished watching it and felt they nailed the 'essence' of batman from the comics, well that's the feeling I got after watching 'The Wolverine'.The only flaw in the film was its final act. It is jarring to say the least only because what came before was of such high quality. It is handled as well as it can be but you cant help but think the studio did not compromise completely and to appeal to the mainstream demanded a more formulaic and familiar end set piece.Supporting characters particularly the predominantly Japanese cast (with the exception of will yun lee who is of Chinese descent) were all handled well. Will yun lee's character 'Harada' seemed like there was a lot more to him and it would have been nice if he took a more prominent role but I can see how that would have taken away from Logan's spotlight. Many props to hiroyuki sanada, his nuance and intensity was also on show here I only wish there was more of him because it was refreshing to see him as an antagonist for a change. I really liked the character yukio (another character from the comics) in this film, beyond her performance her outfit is of note as it was very well thought out to fit with the aesthetic of the film without seemign ridiculous, she was very much an anime like punk character which I think was intentional look given to her, taking her savvy streetwise backstory into consideration.James Mangold was correct when he said this movie was a Japanese noir movie with summer tent-pole action. There was absolutely no lies told about this movie, the trailer was pretty damn honest. Well, except for the fact we have to wait for the DVD/blu ray to see extended action sequences that were alluded to in the trailers but not shown in the film (i'm looking at you ninja scene)!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Wolverine in an out-dated James Bond flick,"At the end of World War 2, Wolverine was held captive in a Japanese POW camp where he saved a young solider named Yashida. In the process, Yashida witnessed Wolverine's ability to withstand physical trauma and quickly heal from it. Flash forward to the present where Wolverine is hiding out in the far North and being haunted by the events that took place in X-Men 3. It is here that Yukio, a mutant with the ability to foresee people's deaths, tracks Wolverine down and convinces him to go back to Japan with her.X-Men was a solid, well-made super-hero film and set the standard for all future Marvel comic book adaptations to live-up to. X-Men 2 (aka X2 and X-Men United) took on a story with multiple plots that almost seemed too much for a single film to handle, yet somehow director Bryan Singer was able to pull it off. Thanks to Brett Ratner, one of the most hated directors in Hollywood, the X-Men film franchise almost lost all of it's credibility thanks to X-Men 3 (aka X-Men: The Last Stand). The third film was a complete mess that is best forgotten, and thankfully it's events will be erased next year with X-Men: Days Of Future Past. The next film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, took everyone's favorite on-screen mutant to new lows. Wolverine went from a real, gritty anti-hero to a cartoonish action star. While Wolverine's backstory had excellent potential to become it's own trilogy, screenwriters David Benioff and Skip Woods proved to be unworthy of adapting the source material. If the screenplay wasn't bad enough, director Gavin Hood's choices to bring the script to life were all wrong. Over-the-top, laughable action sequences with special effects that were a decade behind their time.Thankfully director Matthew Vaughn brought hope back to the X-Men films with X-Men: First Class. Vaughn's prequel not only gave new life to the series, with an excellent new cast, it surpassed the greatness of any of the previous X-Men films. When it was announced Darren Aronofsky was attached to direct The Wolverine, the hype became almost impossible for any film to live-up to. When Aronofsky dropped out, Twentieth Century Fox replaced the acclaimed director with James Mangold. Mangold may not have allure of Aronofsky but he does have some Oscar winning titles under his belt, such as Girl, Interrupted and Walk The Line. However his career took a turn for the worse with his last film, the Tom Cruise & Cameron Diaz disaster, Knight and Day, which tried to be an action-comedy but instead was annoyingly unbearable to sit through. Mangold had a chance to make-up for Knight and Day with The Wolverine but has failed miserably.The Wolverine sheds the cartoonish action of X-Men Origins and brings back the gritty anti-hero. Only now Wolverine is more depressed than angry. The film is darker and hints at becoming a character study but is interrupted by a plot from an out-dated James Bond film. Meanwhile Wolverine is being haunted by nightmares of Jean Grey, something that only becomes more and more irritating as the film moves forward. These dream sequences are also a constant reminder of the film we've all tried hard to forget, X-Men 3.There is more story than action but we find ourselves wanting to see Wolverine in-action instead of wandering around Tokyo sad and wounded. Too much is explained in areas of the story that we do not care about, or are not necessary, while the things we want explained never are. When we finally do get the action we've been waiting for it plays out more like an R-rated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.Aside from Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen, everyone in this film lacks the ability to act or speak understandable English. The special effects are as bad as X-Men Origins and the action/fight sequences lack any tension or excitement. What makes matters worse is that we already know X-Men: Days Of Future Past is going to erase the events of this film, so in the end, we have no reason to actually care what happens.The Wolverine, at it's best, is boring. It makes X-Men Origins look like the action epic it tried to be. The only redeemable thing about this entire production is that one day it will be a great film to throw on and make fun of with your friends at how horrible it truly is.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

An American Wolverine in Tokyo.,"The second of Wolverine's standalone movies, The Wolverine sees Logan (Hugh Jackman) travelling to Tokyo where dying businessman Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi) would like to say goodbye to the man who saved his life during WWII. While in Japan, Logan becomes embroiled in a battle for control of Yashida's empire, and must protect the life of the businessman's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto).The Wolverine is far from the best of the X-Men movies - the plot isn't strong enough to sustain the 126 minute runtime and is riddled with holes - but Jackman is always great, and any film with ninjas is cool in my book. The film also features one of the silliest action scenes of the franchise - a battle between Logan and the yakuza on the roof of a speeding Bullet train - which, despite its preposterousness, is still entertaining, AND it's got a fight against a giant adamantium samurai robot with a flaming sword, which must count for something.My advice: sit back, switch off your brain, and enjoy the spectacle, safe in the knowledge that the next Wolverine movie, Logan (2017), is reputedly much, much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""The Wolverine"" is a big improvement over the last Wolverine movie","After ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" came out five years ago, which it receive many mixed or negative reviews by critics and fans alike were not satisfied with the final results on how the movie did. I used to love it, but not anymore because ""The Wolverine"" is a big improvement over the last Wolverine movie. James Mangold is a much capable director to make the Wolverine movie as it should be. The last Wolverine movie tried to be a character study, but it was poorly executed; this movie did better. The story is well told and it does manage to be more faithful to the Wolverine comics because our main character does go to Japan, and fall in love with Mariko. Hugh Jackman gives an amazing performance, and should be more proud for this movie. Jackman admitted it that the last Wolverine movie didn't do well as he thought it would. The rest of the Japanese cast all did well for there parts. Famke Janssen returning as Jean Grey did fine, but nothing special I can say. I can say that for Wolverine's character does work for his downer side because he kill Jean on the third X-Men, and we do actually feel bad for him. The music by Marco Beltrami is actually really good, which it does differ from Harry Gregson- Williams's score. The special effects are much better than the last one, and thankfully, the claws went back from CG to practical. The movie did kept me interest for what is going on, and never I got bored from it. The third act is what most people complained about. To me, I don't think its that bad as what others say. I still think is on par with the first two acts of the movie, and never thought it was that campy. If it was, then maybe the first two acts would be campy, and it be like watching Joel Schumacher's Batman movies. I mean you got to least have some action in the third act, where we do go into a big climax like most other superhero movies. To be honest, I did not grew up with X-Men that much because I was more a Batman fan. I grew up with the show a bit, but not the comics; its just how I see it, and how I feel about it. If you don't like how the third act went that is fine, but I don't think its really that bad. My only problem is that I wish if this movie treats ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" like it never exist, but if its here to stay so be it. ""The Wolverine"" is by far my favorite X-Men because I was more intrigued to the Wolverine than any other X-Men characters. If ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" tops this movie, then it might be my favorite. I give ""The Wolverine"" a 10 out of 10.UPDATE: I originally give this movie a 9 out of 10, but now I am giving it a 10 out of 10 because I just saw ""X-Men Days of Future Past"" in theaters which made my problems go away.

"Jackson impresses, but I doubt The Wolverine will linger for long in people's minds","After one failed origin story with the dismal X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009), Hugh Jackman's short-tempered Logan AKA Wolverine is given another chance at a stand alone movie. With the X-Men movies generally hit-and-miss, mainly due to an over-abundance of mutants, director James Mangold has taken the story into unfamiliar territory. There's no army of mutants baddies for the mutton-chopped hero to slice apart, nor is he held back and forced into the background by his fellow X-Men. The Wolverine takes us and Wolverine to a different continent entirely, only to find he even has enemies in Japan.Tortured by the death of Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Logan (Hugh Jackman) is long-haired and bearded and hiding out in Yukon, Canada. After an incident in a local bar, he is befriended by the samurai sword-wielding Yukio (Rila Fukushima) who has been sent by an old friend to recruit Wolverine. The old friend is Yashida (Hal Yamanouchi), a Japanese soldier rescued by Logan during the bombing of Nagasaki in 1945. Yashida is on the verge of death, and in his search for elongating his life, wants to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his own body. When Logan refuses, Yashida passes the following day, only for the funeral to be attacked by yakuza gangsters looking to kidnap Yashida's granddaughter Mariko (Tao Okamoto) and heir to his billion-dollar company.It's a flimsy plot to say the least, and not one that successful, multi- million dollar blockbusters are founded on. And here lies the biggest problem for The Wolverine, as although a change of pace and setting is always welcome, there's not much happening on screen for Logan to sink his claws into. The decision to move the action to the neon-lit Japan is an interesting one, but doesn't seem to serve any other purpose than to allow for some admittedly gorgeous-looking set-pieces, and to introduce a giant samurai robot for Logan to bash around. Lightly comic scenes of cultural differences are amusing, but seem out of place considering that Logan is repeatedly told he is a ronin, a samurai without a master.With Logan seemingly invincible, The Wolverine does the thing that most superhero movies do nowadays which is to strip him of his powers. With Batman battered and imprisoned in The Dark Knight Rises (2012) and Tony Stark without his army of metallic suits in Iron Man 3 (2013), here Wolverine's healing abilities are drained by villain The Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova), who infects his body with a parasite. This is successful in making a more reluctant, damaged hero, and therefore adding dimensions to his character, but (as sexy as she is), Viper is a pretty thin and nonthreatening baddie, and resembles Uma Thurman's Posion Ivy from Joel Schumacher's Batman & Robin (1997) too much to be taken seriously.However, Jackman is as compelling as ever in the role, which is the sole reason that there is still life in Wolverine's stand-alone franchise. This is now his sixth film, in a role he has played for 13 years, and this is probably his most dynamic performance. The Wolverine is heavily flawed, but manages to be a minor success thanks to Jackman's ferocity and more concentration on the hero everyone came to see. There's also a nice little tie-in at the end to the upcoming X-Men: Days of Future Past, adding yet another weave into Marvel's ever-expanding universe. But, with a weak climax and a strangely thin storyline, I would be surprised if The Wolverine lingers for very long in many people's minds.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Much Better Wolverine Story Than The Original!,"Like me, if you saw the original Wolverine movie, you probably came away very disappointed with how they unraveled a little bit about his past as well as his origins. In every possible way, the original movie was underwhelming and felt much like an exercise in futility. The story was bland, the plot gave you a little bit to care about while at the same time leaving you wondering if there was really a point to everything and it all just felt nobody was interested in giving the fans the Wolverine movie/story they wanted.Enter the 2nd movie, The Wolverine, and many of the problems have been rectified. This time around we catch up to Logan(aka Wolverine) hiding out in the mountains and just trying to pass the time away in what's become a very meaningless and empty life. Logan's days are filled with futility and recurring nightmares of the death of Jean Grey which slowly cause him to question his own existence. Because the poor guy is basically immortal & has an incredible healing factor, the loss of his love in Jean Grey haunts him and leaves him pining for the cold embrace of death.This is where the story's gravity comes from, which is truly wonderful considering that the character cannot die easily if at all. If you are even a little bit familiar with the Wolverine character, you'll know that he's literally lived & survived through a great many events that would have finished any other man thousands of times over. Here however, this facet is used to drive a very heartwarming & gripping story of love and loss and how one man comes to terms with it.It all starts out in WWII with the Japanese soldiers in Hiroshima standing guard. As we all know, at this period of time Japan was at war with the US and was about to be decimated for the attack that occurred at Pearl Harbor. We enter this movie, shortly before the bombs are dropped and with Logan saving one Japanese soldier who eternally becomes grateful for this sacrificial act of bravery. The movie then continues on and shows us Logan living back in the US and laying low while experiencing recurring nightmares which drive him to the edge of insanity until one day he is tracked to a bar by a Japanese woman who has been sent to find him and bring him back to Japan.Once back in Japan, Logan discovers that the Japanese soldier whose life he saved in WWII is still alive but barely. It is here that we find out that the old man wanted Logan because of his healing abilities and supposed immortality, which is why he was brought to Japan in the first place. To make this review as spoiler-free as possible, it then continues on with Logan finding out the truth behind all of the circumstances that brought him to Japan and he ultimately finds meaning in his life once again and comes to appreciate the mutant gift that he has been born with.As was mentioned earlier, this movie elegantly handles the story of Logan/Wolverine coming to grips with his immortality and ability to outlive practically everyone in his life. The story unfolds very well and at a pace that seems appropriate, not being too slow or too quick at any point. Although the movie is just over 2 hours in length, it feels like the pace is just right and enough time is spent giving us an opportunity to relate & emote with Logan/Wolverine. The action isn't as spectacular as Marvel's other summer 2013 blockbuster, Iron Man 3, however it's still pretty intense and punctuates the story very well.All in all, this is definitively the best Wolverine/X-Men story that has been told to date aside from X-Men: First Class. It also does a good job of quasi-rebooting the X-Men franchise which builds up to the 2014 X-Men sequel - Days Of Future Past. I'm glad that they got this movie & story right with this, otherwise I would've said it's time to put the franchises on hiatus and focus on other Marvel franchises instead. This movie however proves that like Wolverine, the character and the X-Men franchise has a lot of life left in it!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Serviceable in some parts, and silly in others","The Wolverine is far from one of the worst superhero movies of all time, but it might be up there with the most disappointing in recent memory. It feels like a movie that could've and should've been better than it ended up being. The premise is sound, giving Logan/Wolverine an initially solid enough reason to visit Japan and clash with various antagonists there, but the narrative gets more muddled and less satisfying as the film goes on. It's a far cry from the movie that was Logan, which Hugh Jackman and director James Mangold made in 2017. I saw that one back when it came out, and watching this film makes me appreciate it even more; it's what a solo Wolverine (minus the other X-Men) movie should be.One of the lead villains here is very silly; the lady with the CGI tongue and the venom. She's the one part of the movie that never felt like it worked. Much of the rest of the movie kind of fell apart bit by bit as things went on. There's a decent amount of good here, especially early on, to make me think they had something here, but something else got in the way. The final action sequence I know gets a good deal of criticism, too, and I think it's largely deserved.The most memorable scene was schlocky, but maybe also good? There's a ridiculous fight on the top of a bullet train, and it's really dumb but also a good deal of fun. It's probably the only sequence that will stick with me. There's also a fight in some Japanese gardens/near a temple that looked familiar; very similar to a tourist attraction in Syndey called The Chinese Garden of Friendship, which I was at about a month ago. I looked up whether the scene was shot there, and it turns out that particular fight scene was! I read up on it, and it turned out they added some props and made sure to cover certain symbols so it could pass as Japan, but recognizing that location as somewhere I'd been recently was a nice bonus to a sort of serviceable - but also quite disappointing - superhero movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very entertaining.,"I've never cared much for the X-Men movies, though I like many of the actors in them. That said, I found The Wolverine compelling and exciting. A beautiful red haired girl with a samuraï sword cutting up a red neck to pieces, literally; a sweet Japanese grand daughter and lots of ninjas and action. Reminded me of Elektra, which I love and Kill Bill, which I also love. And of course, Hugh Jackman who rules the roost after a well deserved bath and some manicure. He really makes it sound believable. Like others, I found the silver samuraï part silly. Was there really a need to delve into an Iron Man kind of opponent. But what the hell. Show me a man who wouldn't want to be immortal and strong with shiny throat slicing metal spikes coming from his fists. Would do wonder for any weakling self esteem, as far as I'm concerned. But that's what this kind of movies are there for. It releases the brave and courageous inside of each of us. That's what we like about such films. However too many mutants in a movie dilutes the fantasy for me. One is enough, like Elektra, Kiddo in KB and Wolverine. Much easier to root for one do gooder than too many of them. So now I'm waiting for another Wolverine movie. Well done!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
