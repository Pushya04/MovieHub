Charming and fun,"Shortly after Dreamworks screwed up with the uninspired ""Shark Tale"", Pixar contains its remarkably success story with ""The Incredibles"". And while I have to say that I liked ""Finding Nemo"" a bit better, ""The Incredibles"" is still an amazing movie.First of all, this is because it's funny. It's not so funny that you're constantly laughing out loud, but there are more than enough good jokes in the movie to keep you entertained, and it's full of good observations about superhero movies (note all the ridiculous superhero and villain names) and references to other movies. It's also a brilliant James Bond spoof/homage, containing all the gadgets, secret island bases and crazy schemes that made early Bond movies so much fun.Secondly, this movie has heart and charm in droves. It's full of memorably and likable characters you can really identify with and care about. Characters like Edna are instant classics. The voice acting is universally excellent, but Holly Hunter steals the show as Elastigirl. This is a movie that doesn't need toilet humor, characters modeled like celebrities, or a ""hip"" soundtrack...it easily succeeds on charm and style alone.Also, I found it to be a surprisingly good action movie. The plentiful action sequences are full of energy, extremely fast-paced, and exciting, and put many a live-action movie to shame.Finally, I also liked the tone and message of the movie. ""The Incredibles"" basically makes a plea against mediocrity, breaking with the politically correct idea that ""everybody is special"" (and thus nobody really is), and encouraging people to use the talents they have been given. I think this couldn't be more true. Not all people are equally talented (just compare Pixar to Dreamworks), but this is no reason to keep the talented people from not reaching their full potential just because it makes the less talented ones feel bad.""The Incredibles"", while maybe not as hilarious as I had hoped (though it's still very funny), is nonetheless an extremely entertaining movie, that manages to charm you wit its combination of great characters, lots of style, tongue-in-cheek attitude and good message. Highly recommended.****1/2 of ***** stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Amazing! Brilliant! Fabulous! Wonderful! Astonishing! I'm not avoiding using a certain word!,"The Incredibles is a great film, and probably my favourite Pixar picture (Toy Story is the best, but that's different to favourite). It takes a while to properly get into the action, but when it does, it delivers it in spades.And that's exactly it. I would actually call The Incredibles an animated action film, because to be honest, I don't think there was enough comedy to call it an animated action comedy film. There are quite a few funny moments, but the gags don't come as fast as Finding Nemo or Toy Story.That being said, it does have truly amazing action set-pieces, brilliant voice acting, a fabulous script, wonderful characters and the animation is simply.....well....incredible.The music is definitely a stand-out. It actually made me smile, with it's jazzy tones and James Bond type scores.One of the greatest things about The Incredibles is that it's not a kiddies film; it's completely different to all the other Pixar films. They bring out tommy guns in the second scene, for crying out loud! If you want to see a more adult animated film, then go see The Incredibles, and enjoy every minute. But I wouldn't bring someone younger than 4 maybe, because it isn't really aimed at them, and they probably would find it quite scary.This is a great film, one of the best of 2004 in my opinion. If it just had a slightly higher gag rate, than this would be an absolutely perfect picture.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
One of the best films ever made,"17 years after incredibles was released, it continues to be a compelling, entertaining, funny, smart, ambitious, original, mature and just simply enjoyable movie. The dialogue is exceptional and the animation holds up surprisingly well. The characters are well written and very fleshed out. It is an animated film about superheroes and yet the chatacters and world feel so real.It is my favourite pixar film and probably always will be. If you haven't seen this masterpiece yet, stop reading this review and go watch it right now. Infact, even if you've seen it before, just watch it right now. It is that freaking good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Wonderful, beautiful to watch, all in all, incredible.","WOW! What a movie. I can honestly say this is in my top ten movies of all time, how do Pixar continue to out do themselves at every movie release?The Incredibles is a fantastic story, wonderfully scripted and with the most stunning animation you have ever seen, it provides a perfectly rounded story with plenty of action, laughs and (almost) tears.Basically, this is a story of a man encountering a mid life crisis and leaping headlong into it without a care or a thought for his family, proving exceedingly selfish and failing to see the good in his life. Meanwhile the wife is left to try and look after the family. Really, that's the story. Now, what Pixar have done is drop in the idea that the parents are Superheroes, banned from being Super many years previously by the Government and the people, trying to live a normal life. Add to the mix that some of their children have inherited their own powers and that the Super villains are planning a comeback, and you have this wonderful movie.I can't begin to convey how wonderful the animation is, it's perfect. I mean you'll always be looking at it knowing it's animation, but when the story takes you along you'll suddenly realize you're still watching animation. The subtle difference is that you forget, and there are parts (for instance when the father is cheering his son during the race) that you actually think it is real. The effects for water, fire (two of the hardest things to recreate in animation) and lava are wonderful to watch and caught me drawing a breath when I first saw them.The characters and acting are wonderful, and you will find yourself caring about them as real people. At some points I could feel a big swallow coming up and a wavering adams apple, obviously due to the food earlier, nothing to do with the movie.I often find that movies aren't paced well, that they either have too long or too short an introduction to the characters, or the events that lead up to the pivotal point of the movie are unbalanced against the climax, all sorts of combinations. Not here, this move is perfect and well balanced, the story takes you along just when you are ready, and there were no points where I wished we could move on, or something could happen quicker. My only frustration were at the kids, and this was only because they were behaving exactly as real kids would.It was interesting to see the comparisons and links to other famous Superheroes through comic-lore. Definitely with nods to The Fantastic Four, Silver Surfer and huge nods to The Watchmen. My only concern is that there is so much similarity to The Watchmen that those who haven't read the graphic novel will be saying ""That's the Incredibles movie"" when Watchmen finally comes to fruition.The short film showing before this was wonderful in itself, and had the audience laughing out loud loads. Excellent, and once again, outdoes every short that they've produced before. Boundin' was beautifully animated and wonderfully told. Guaranteed to bring a huge big smile to your face.All in all I think this movie is perfect and truly incredible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"A Truly, Pardon the Pun, Incredible Movie","This is one of the finest animated films I have ever seen. Not only is it a fine animated film, it is a great film period. The film obviously takes its cue from several real life super hero comic books, especially The Fantastic Four and the Justice Society of America. The Fantastic Four comparison is obvious due to the fact that Elatigirl and Violet were obviously inspired by Mr. Fantastic (aka. Reed Richards) and the Invisible Woman (aka. Sue Storm Richards) respectively. The J.S.A. influence is a little more obscure. Several years ago, DC Comics issued a mini-series that attempted to explain the demise of the Justice Society by claiming that the group was forced to disband after their loyalty to America was questioned during the 1950's. In this film, all the heroes were forced into hiding after the government refused to pay for wrongful legal claims brought against the super heroes of this film. Also, there are many in jokes that the casual viewer might not get, but that made it enjoyable for comic book fans. This the island scenes look as if they could have been inspired by many of the series produced by Gerry Anderson of the 1960's (eg. the Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet).Another thing that made this film unique was its look. If you notice, the city where the story takes place looks like a fairly modern metropolis. However, if you look at the cars in the film, most of them look as if they would have been more at home in the mid to late 1960's. Also, the way that many of the characters were dressed also could have put them in that time.However, the thing that I really loved about this film was the fact that even though it was geared primarily to children, it was dark enough in theme to appeal to adults. In fact, there are a couple of scenes that you wouldn't normally associate with a film geared towards children.This film is definitely a classic of animation and once again Pixar shows why they are the masters of computer animation.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
My favorite film from Pixar in over five years- Bird and company produce a triumph of a family film,"Writer-director Brad Bird here has something that I was caught off-guard by just a bit. I always expect Pixar films to be above-par, family entertainment, the kinds of films that can have an appeal to adults on a satirical, jab-in-the-side effect by having the characters reacting to each other as they would on a film with a higher rating, whilst giving the bright colors, action, and silliness that appeals to kids. Watching The Incredibles, their sixth feature-length offering, I wasn't so entertained and amused since their 98 film A Bug's Life, and it almost brought me back to the emotional impact I felt when in the theater for the first time getting Toy Story into my system.It's a film that takes on a type in society that we all know well (in the past they've done toys, bugs, monsters, undersea life, and now comic book archetypes) and transforms it superbly to the imaginative computer-animated landscape. This is also in credit due to Brad Bird, who proved five years ago with his sleeper The Iron Giant that he could transcend the genre and appeal with heart and vigor for almost every age bracket.So what little touches make The Incredibles so appealing? How it starts to deconstruct the idea of a superhero, perhaps, as well as how the family unit is shown in the usual conventions under unusual and funny circumstances. As an example, one of our heroes Mr. Incredible, a.k.a. Bob Parr (voiced wonderfully by Craig T. Nelson), goes to visit a woman who fixes and creates the uniforms of superheroes. In one scene she explains why a cape is not a good idea. This is the kind of scene that might not make it into most Hollywood movies, and would sometimes if not often be discredited as being too 'smart' for kids to get. But by appealing to a kind of level late teens and adults can relate to, it reaches a higher, far more intelligent plane. In fact, many of the best scenes in the film take on what we all know in films displaying the 'family unit' and morph it with the power and imagination of superheroes.I won't go too much into the plot as some may already have, except to say that what makes the story in and of itself appealing is how it is a fully formed story, and doesn't try and sell itself short like other animated films (i.e. Sharktale for example). It also uses it's PG-rating perimeter wisely, and Bird and company create action sequences that are as exciting, if not more so, than in the action films that have been released this year (in fact, some of the scenes in the climax, for my money, could rival a couple of those in Spider-Man 2). By setting up the right emotional bases with the characters- Bob, his wife Elasti-girl (Holly Hunter), their kids, and with supporting characters voiced finitely by the likes of Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee, by the time the high-charged, internally fantasy scenes take off, they take off with great conviction and excitement.Overall, The Incredibles is a film that is, in a way, what audiences wish they could get and rarely do- it's a film with wit and observance, a kind of video-game where the results are not as expectable as can be. Some kids may not get it as much as adults might, which is just as well, as it sometimes operates on a level like Antz did, only through the sphere of Disney. In other words, if you say the teaser trailer, which involved the out-of-shape Mr. Incredible trying with all his might to buckle his tights, you'll know what the film could bring. Personally, I can't wait to see it again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Dahling, dahling, dahling.... this movie is incredible","I hope that this movie does really well because this has to be one of the best animated movies I have ever seen. The story is really cool and it's obvious that there is a lot of respect here for the source of superheroes, whether it be comic books, serial flicks or Saturday morning cartoons.The movie has an undeniably cool retro feel to it and it shows not only in the design of the picture but also in the music, which definitely sounds like something out of a 60's 007 flick. It is also unusually dark, especially for a Pixar flick. I'm not saying it's dark where people are getting their heads delivered to someone in a box or family members are sleeping with each other or anything like that but there were moments where I found myself wondering if a little kid might be able to deal with the intensity of what was going on on screen. Maybe it was the fact that the heroes were in very real danger most of the time. The bad guys weren't out to catch them as much as they were out to kill them. When you discover who the film's villain is, you can literally feel his anger coming off the screen. I may be over-exaggerating a bit but then again, it really is to the film's credit that it deals with human emotions in the way that it does.Even though you are watching a film that is populated by CGI characters, the emotions they convey in what they say and do come across as purely believable. Whether watching Bob Parr interact with people at his job or just sitting at his desk was something that rang true to me, just in the feeling of it. Everything about this movie has a very concrete feel to it, even while looking like something you'd see in a comic book. The computer graphics in general were absolutely amazing and the voice acting is excellent across the board, so good in fact, that I really can't pick a favorite from the entire cast. I have to say that Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter were very good as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl respectively. They had a moment near the end of the film that actually touched me but you can see that for yourselves. Samuel L. Jackson was hilarious and thankfully, he wasn't overused. Dash and Violet were realized so well that every time they came up on screen, I loved every minute of it. Dash, in particular was one of the funniest characters in the movie. Jason Lee made for a formidable villain as Syndrome. I loved the fact that he was your typical antagonist but was also aware of the conventions surrounding such a role, like when he chides himself for 'monologuing'. He was also one ruthless bastard, I'll give him that. Even the bit part characters were hilarious. There was a kid on a tricycle in this movie who comes out twice and made me laugh out loud both times.In fact, this movie reminds me of why I like Finding Nemo over Monsters, Inc. In Finding Nemo, not only are the main characters great but every other character they run into makes some kind of impression on you. Remember all the characters that Marlin and Dory ran into on their adventures together? Of course you do. Whether it was that crazy pelican with the Australian accent, Willem Dafoe as Gill, leader of the fishtank crew, or Bruce the Shark, you remember them after all is said and done and it makes the viewing experience that much richer. That's exactly how The Incredibles is. Every character that appears will make you laugh or intrigue you in some way. I have to admit that I was laughing myself throughout the entire movie, especially with the character of Edna Mode who almost steals the movie. Man, even the end credits are awesome! I have to give the director Brad Bird a big thumbs up for this one. He pulled it off and hopefully this will attract attention to his other animated film, ""The Iron Giant"", which was sadly overlooked when it was released and is also a really great film.All in all, I can't recommend this movie enough. I left very satisfied and felt no need to compare this to the rest of Pixar's movies. This one is just as good if not better than any other animated movie released this year and rightfully deserves its place among the best animated movies of all time.RATING: ***** out of *****.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Serious original fun!  A family film in every sense of the word,"The Incredibles is a simple and slightly formulaic comic book-style animated Disney/Pixar feature with a great big heart. I just experienced this film for the second time, and though I didn't really catch anything new, or achieve a different perspective, I was certainly as entertained as I was in the theater the first time.The Incredibles are the family of Mr. Incredible and Elasti-girl, living in a nightmare future where superheroes have been sued and regulated to the point that they are either forced underground or into protection programs complete with assumed identities and mediocre jobs. Mr. Incredible himself is invincibly physically strong, but emotionally drained by the uselessness of his new life as an insurance claim examiner, and his depression is so complete that he feels as if he is detaching from all that he loves. The children are ""Dash"" - a miniature Flash clone, ""Violet"" - who has all of the basics of Sue Richards, The Fantastic Four's Invisible Girl, and infant Jack Jack - about whom little can be said. Eventually, the entire family gets swept up into a crisis of vast proportion as a forgotten piece of Mr. Incredible's past comes back to threaten the very world which has rejected them all.The film really does derive a lot of its archetypal character points from Marvel's classic Fantastic Four, but adds brilliant humor, a very positive message, and some voice work which really is nothing less than Incredible. I was especially impressed by Sarah Vowell's Violet. The voice talent in general, however, is exceptionally good, and the supporting cast doesn't slip a centimeter. Brad Bird's Edna is also a memorable stand-out.Visually, the film is as good as any of the recent animated features most movie fans have enjoyed, though perhaps slightly less inventive and a bit less pretentious. I guess I would have to say that it's also my favorite, with Finding Nemo running a close second.This would be a great film to see with your kids. It's clean, fun, and yet serious enough to engage even the most angst-ridden teenager. It also contains some very positive messages about the value and meaning of heroism, family, and 'sticking together' through the worst and the best of times.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"A GOOD MOVIE, BUT....","The story is great, but I do think that one more rewrite could've made it better. Why? There's not enough Elastigirl, Dash and Violet.

The Omnibot 7000's first screenplay,"People have been making fun of superhero clichés for more than ten years, since before The Tick, Tiny Toons and the like, and this itself has been a cliché: to observe, ""Bad guys have giant secret lairs! And they ""monologue"" before they kill you! LOL."" It's an easier formula than actually inventing a new superhero saga.Now this worn-out schtick has unfortunately become the basis for a Pixar movie. Not nearly as well-written as ""Toy Story,"" this thing feels like it was written on autopilot, with only the most obvious plot developments proceeding from the ""what if a suburban family were superheroes?"" premise with a clanking predictability (Writer: ""OMG, here's the part where they fight over a remote control! And they fight over traffic directions! And...what else do married couples do?"") that made me wonder whether Brad Bird was a screenwriter's pseudonym for Omnibot 7000.While the movie pretends like it's about breaking out of suburban conformity, it comes across like a celebration of it. I would rather have watched a movie about Samuel Jackson's character, Frozone, who provides some spark amid the numbing sitcom vibe.The pic further loses points for taking cheap shots at the French, public interest law, and human life. 'Cuz halfway through, the movie seems to get superheroes badly confused with James Bond, and this annoying family proceeds to spend quite a while killing off identical-looking bad guys, rather remorselessly: someone is blown to bits, and in the next shot everyone is hugging. The family that kills together...Real superheroes bring people to justice, rather than slaughtering them. Not that this is a violent movie in its slaying of faceless drones. No, what you get feels like you're stuck at the house of the dullest people you know, while they play PS2 in their living room. I liked it better when it was called ""Metal Gear.""And, yeah, would a memorable joke be too much to ask?",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Good Entertainemt For About Any Age,"This was somewhat of a surprise hit when it came out in 2004. Most of the attention was on a competing animated film but this is the one that turned out to be a huge box-office success. Word of mouth helped his immensely. It's what made me check it out, as several friends recommended it. I wound up agreeing with them: it's excellent entertainment.The visuals and sound are very impressive, but it's the story that carries this film: a solid combination of humor, drama, suspense, family ties and action. The action, as in many modern-day films, was overdone in the last half hour of the movie but overall....the DVD is a good investment since people 3 to 63 should enjoy this.As an adult, it's not always easy to keep my attention for two hours with animation but the fact this movie does, tells you how good the story is presented.

"Is it a bird, no it's a plane, no it's the Incredibles","Is it a bird, no it's a plane, no it's the IncrediblesImagine if one crazed scientist had a colossal sized blender and put the love and affection of The Modern Family in it, then sprinkled some dysfunctional madness of Malcolm in the Middle and then added superpowers to the mix, I guarantee that what comes out still won't be a match for the crazy, adorable, high octane and utter zaniness that are the Incredibles. The dad is supper strong, the mother can stretch like taffy, and the teenage girl can become invisible and throw up force fields and the 10 year old is lightening fast, which is quiet lucky when they must come up against the rich, genius of the villainous Syndrome, who seeks to destroy the hero he once worshipped in Mr. Incredible and an the whole city along with him. Despite the film being an animation featuring a story line that was extremely fantastical, not once did I remember it was a movie. The actions scenes were spell bounding and highly imaginative. But most importantly, I really believed in these characters that spat witty sharp dialogue at each other at a furious pace, not just because they were funny, but because the characters were so believable and relatable. Subsequently it should come as to no surprise that film was nominated for a best screenplay Oscar, which is a rarity for an animated film, but this ain't just your average animated film, it's an Incredible animated film",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Greatly bundled pack of entertainment,"Pixar has again proved that it's ethics and capabilities are inexterminable even for the tough-willed Dreamworks, which are gradually attempting to catch up on with standards. But with Pixar's new title, we once more experience a great gratifying animation which deeps you inside by it's humorous and enthralling plot and keeps you laughing out loudly until the very end. Dreamworks' titles compared to Pixars are not too peculiar, but they seem to rip all their titles from Pixar and create a fake illusion of originality. Now that Pixar has created another chef-d'oeuvre, no doubt Dreamworks will once more rip the idea and create a title relating to superheroes. 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The Incredibly Mediocre Movie..,"Don't get me wrong...it has its moments. But they are few and far between in this film.The decision to make the story more ""real"" by having the superheroes portrayed as an ordinary family with ordinary family problems went a long way to disappoint me, even though I had expected this from reviews. To me ""ordinary"" and ""super"" are two words that should never get mixed together. I appreciate the movie's thought that, if everyone had superpowers, then everyone would be ordinary, but come on. I want to be entertained, not run through an updated episode of The Flintstones.Another nail in the coffin for this one was the hype. Once again, the movie moguls hype up a film, raising our expectations to silly levels. How can we be anything but disappointed with the reality?If you compare this movie to the likes of Toy Story or Finding Nemo it doesn't even come close to being in the same league.Unlike those movies, where a bit of affectionate scene plagiarism was appreciated for what it was, The Incredibles just annoyed the Hell out of me with its ""Return of the Jedi"" jungle chase scene. A quick flit through the jungle with the hero being chased by the bad guys - just long enough for you to realize it for what it was - would have been fine. But no. They had to drag the scene out for minute after minute, adding in all the scenes from the RoTJ chase, such as the enemy drawing alongside, the swinging from the vines etc. until you were sick of it and praying it would end.There are some good ideas, but on the whole the film doesn't get my thumbs up of approval. Once again, partly the hype to blame, but also mostly because it's not that good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

There are some very reconizable voices in there that you know very well.Is this just a kid's movie? No, it does contain some adult humor.

Full speed ahead once it gets past a slow start...,"THE INCREDIBLES is an incredibly popular Pixar computer animated action cartoon that made millions at the box office because it's an entertaining and funny romp about a family of super-incredible heroes.Audiences can relate because the heads of the family (Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl--voiced by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter) really want to settle down and have normal lives in suburbia without having to resort to their superpowers to save the world.But boredom creeps into their lives and the message of the film seems to be, if you have a gift use it. After years of suppressing his gift, Mr. Incredible gets lured into active service again and then the film really gets going.Once the film shifts into action mode, there's an incredible amount of things to watch as the scenes go speeding by relentlessly in search of a new adventure at every turn. And when Mr. Incredible's family joins the search for his whereabouts when he's captured by his nemesis, the film lurches forward with even greater speed.Apparently, audiences reacted very enthusiastically to this sort of crime caper action cartoon, animated in great style by Pixar. If you enjoy watching comic book heroes do their thing, you won't be disappointed in ""The Incredibles.""Of course, it goes against the theory that the Disney studios kept in mind when making the first feature-length cartoon, afraid that too bright colors and too much fast action would give moviegoers a headache for a feature-length cartoon.

Good movie...TERRIBLE messages,"Movies don't just entertain -- they MEAN. They have messages. They instruct, influence, and evoke.So what is the meaning of _The_Incredibles_? Simple: You Don't Count.I am, perhaps, unusual in that I scrutinize every movie, TV show, newspaper story and advertisement for its deeper message -- but I think that practice is a lot more common when we consider media aimed at children, as this movie, with its toy tie-ins and McDonalds-driven marketing, most certainly is. So when friends suggested that Pixar had hit another one out of the park with _The_Incredibles_, I naturally screened it for my kid, thinking this would be a beauty.Imagine my shock and dismay to find that, underneath the comic-book overtones, this is not a movie for kids at all. Not only is the violence fast, furious, and rampant, it's deadly...as the characters themselves point out, Saturday Morning Cartoons offer kids an unrealistic belief that deadly violence is somehow fun. Well OK, I can get behind that message, but it's going to be tricky explaining to my six-year-old that when he sees a plane full of bad-guys blow up as it rips through a tree, that this isn't just metaphorical -- that guy is DEAD.But I got more and more disturbed when I saw that the majority of the violence in this movie wasn't being perpetrated by the bad guys at all -- it's mostly coming from our ""heroes,"" The Incredible family themselves. Mr. I. uproots trees, tosses bombs, knocks down buildings, and punches mere mortal villains with fists which we've seen lift train cars. And then, in a fit of pique, in an early establishing scene, Mr. Incredible punches his boss. Who is *NOT* a villain. He's an unarmed civilian, which Mr. Incredible outweighs by about 200 pounds. He punches this guy through several walls, and later views of this poor guy in the hospital make it clear that he's broken a lot of bones.This is our HERO???? And then there's the main message of the film: you don't count. You see you, me, all us non-super-heroes, we aren't ""special,"" like the Incredibles. And no, the idea that everyone has some special quality, that everyone has unique skills or traits, that's disdained by our hero as a ""celebration of mediocrity"" -- his normal job, like the one you and I have, you see that's not good enough for the special people. No, the special people should be given the opportunity to requisition government aircraft, to own supercars they haven't paid for, to throw civilians through walls without any consequence if they act annoying. In fact, the guy who suggests that everyone *could* be special or super, if given the chance, is the VILLAIN of the movie! So there goes about 2,000 years worth of morality, right down the drain. According to this movie, might makes right, and anyone who thinks otherwise deserves to be stomped into the pavement. Jesus wept.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Pixar's most ""epic"" animated film since ""Toy Story.""","Although ""The Incredibles"" is not the best film Pixar has released (via Disney) since 1995's ""Toy Story,"" I felt it is the most epic. When I went to go see ""Toy Story"" in 1995, the epic scale of the picture -- the non-stop frantic pace, the action sequences, etc. -- were all so breathtaking that it contained the same tour de force attitude as, believe it or not, a blockbuster such as ""Terminator 2"": a crowd-pleasing, overwhelming picture.""Monsters, Inc."" wasn't quite as epic. It was a great movie, just as good as ""Toy Story,"" but it didn't have the same style per se. ""Finding Nemo"" was very good as well but still didn't capture the same epic scale as ""Toy Story."" (I'm not saying that's a bad thing, just different.) ""The Incredibles"" seemed to. I saw it on DVD and from beginning to end the action is non-stop, the laughs aplenty, and the exotic locations and action-hero references continuous. For this reason, somehow, it reminded me very much of ""Toy Story."" It seemed like older Pixar, rather than some of their newer stuff (all of which is great as well). Pixar has yet to make a bad movie. Even their worst -- ""A Bug's Life"" -- was better than most animated films.""The Incredibles"" also returns to the spoof roots of ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Toy Story"" (something ""Finding Nemo"" did but not as often) -- it parodies cultural references. (Something hard to do in an underwater sea adventure.) Although this is a family film, it is NOT a ""children's film."" That is evident from the beginning when the fake news reel in ""The Incredibles"" features articles about a suicidal man suing superheroes because he ""didn't want to be saved."" This is clearly a tongue-in-cheek criticism of the shameless legal standards of the day. (Such as the woman who sued McDonald's because her coffee was too hot. A true story!) Another film might not be clever enough to integrate iconic cultural references into itself but ""The Incredibles"" does.Similarly, using superheroes, Pixar examines the at-home relationship of a family and spoofs our own rituals. (Such as eating at the dinner table -- the mom tries to stop the squabbling kids just like we do, only because she has superpowers, it's a bit... different.) All in all ""The Incredibles"" really is a great animated film. I enjoyed it more than ""Finding Nemo"" (which I didn't expect to as I loved ""Nemo"") and just as much as ""Toy Story"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" Pixar has solidified a new style of family film-making -- the cultural parody animated film -- and the evidence of this can be seen in such take-offs of the formula as ""Shrek"" and ""Shark Tale"" (which featured many cultural references as well).All in all ""The Incredibles"" is incredibly fun. And funny.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
A Movie That Really Deserves to Be Among the IMDb Top 100,"After many unfair lawsuits against superheroes, inflicted by persons saved by them, the government requests the superheroes to retire and hide their identity as if they were normal citizens. Mr. Incredible marries Elastigirl, has three children (Violet, Dash and Jack Jack) and has a boring job in an insurance company. When a chance is offered to Mr. Incredible to become a hero again, he becomes happy and in shape. However, when the identity of the mysterious contractor is revealed, the family has to fight together against the evil Syndrome to stay alive. ""The Incredible"" is an amazing movie, and has superseded my best expectation of an animation. The story is excellent, having action and humor in right doses, the characters are very charismatic and it is a movie recommended as an excellent family entertainment. Today there are 528 comments, most of them favorable, and the movie is in top 250: #91. Therefore, I believe it is not necessary to extend my review. Last but not the least, ""The Incredible"" is a movie that really deserves to be among the IMDb Top 100. Lets wait for the inevitable sequel My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Os Incríveis"" (""The Incredibles"")",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredible in every sense of it!,"""The Incredibles"" is by far and away the most mature and engaging Pixar film to date.This movie is nothing less than a display of sheer brilliance to an utmost prestigious level that proves the genius in director Brad Bird (""The Iron Giant""). From the perfectly created characters to the witty and humorous dialog involved, ""The Incredibles"" is the ideal film for true fans of the animation and/or comic book genre. It doesn't fail to provide viewers of with a fragment of every genre; incredible animation, action, and even a bit of drama.However, the aspect most evident in ""The Incredibles"" that was frequently credited for the success of its predecessors was the emotional aspect. The thesis on midlife crossroads on personal and professional dilemmas was well presented.Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) seems an average guy who works in an insurance agency, and lives a ""normal"" mediocre life with his wife Helen and three kids: Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack. But there's more to it, actually. Bob used to be Mr. Incredible, and Helen was Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), two of the world's greatest crime fighters until a series of lawsuits have forced superheroes to adopt civilian identities. But when Bob receives a mysterious call that has him for a top secret assignment, he sees this as an opportunity to be Mr. Incredible again. He accepts the mission but soon discovers that it is a trap of a nemesis from way back, and the whole family eventually has to to join him to fight evil and save the world.What we have here is something that unfortunately becoming quite a rare thing nowadays: an example of a truly brilliant animation. As I have said, not only does it have some of the most phenomenal computer graphics and action sequences ever committed to film, but like all the best movies it also has the heart to support the movie between the adrenaline-pumping moments.The main reason for this is the great characterization. ""The Incredibles"" may contain a little too much of violence that may be better suited for older children than the younger ones. Yet one cannot easily discount the family themes and comic episodes, with characters like superhero-costume designer Edna (voiced by Bird) and Bob's friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) providing ample support.Another is that the film, as is with previous Pixar films, is effective in the use of computer generated images (CGI) which is a major plus for moviegoers. The details in which the animators for the film present are awe-inspiring and breathtaking. The music also pasted itself impeccably with the atmosphere Bird has created for the film. Very retro.It is a demonstration of precision and excellence, created by the brilliance and meticulous mannerisms of the director. It goes beyond an animated movie and is without a doubt one of the best animations of all time. It is truly incredible to see a film like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Its popularity is well justified,"This is an animation film about lost heroes resuming their service again to stop evil plots being implemented.I think the runaway success of this film is that the film's lead heroes are very everyday. The family is portrayed to be heroes who have had their glorious days but got disgraced because of a series of negative incidents. They then choose to have a family life and stay away from the limelight. They are reluctant to use their supernatural powers, and only uses them when the situation gets out of hand. This key point is radically different to most superhero movies, where the heroes have always been glorious heroes and will forever be glorious heroes. In this movie, the heroes fall and then rise back up again, creating a positive message for kids.Apart from this fundamental difference from other superhero movies, it also has a great story. It also has cute and attractive animation. This film really deserves the attention and praise, and cannot simply be attributed to be popular because it is an animation.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Super, human.","This is a very enjoyable movie, with a lot of smart and interesting twists to the superhero genre. however it feels like two separate movies. The first half is more serious and is like a cross between a superhero spoof and the idea of a superhero taken as reality. The problem comes when the movie switches from being something that questioned the genre and made it more real to something that no longer takes its characters seriously. By the end this is just a ride movie, not an action movie with consistent character development and a point that people could walk away with. now, i'm not talking about a sound-byte ""Message"" that was missing, because something like that actually was there, it was just betrayed by the ending. The family of the incredibles became people with extraordinary powers rather than truly special or extraordinary people. *Spoiler* The lack of responsibility towards the villain that Mr. ""incredible"" showed disproves that he is anything other than a man with superhuman strength. He is not a hero. His ego had a part in creating the villain. syndrome had free will and choice to do what he did and it couldn't be called Mr incredible's fault, but Mr. incredible does kill him in a very cavalier manner with no attempt to capture or rehabilitate him, as a hero, incredible is supposed to be better in character than regular people. The film also treated the killing of syndrome as a joke, with that cape thing. on the one hand something like that can be considered funny in a cartoonish comic book setting but not in a world that is supposed to be taken seriously as the world of the incredibles had been set up to be. This movie had great potential and is still excellent in many respects, but it is not the great film that many critics and audiences seem to think it is.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
It really is incredible.,"'The Incredibles (2004)' is a masterclass in character, always putting its central family in front of its superb superhero action. That action is often somewhat counter-intuitively but cleverly conveyed using the tropes and language of the spy genre, giving the movie a decidedly 60s flavour in the process. The piece is a much more mature affair than you might expect, being a family film in every sense of the word - a movie suitable for kids as opposed to one made for them. It is nuanced, affecting and will actually pay off more for the older members of its audience. It plays like a live-action picture with the world's most convincing special effects, since they're rendered exactly like the rest of the flick, and some of the most convincing characters, too. What makes the film so fantastic is that it's genuinely entertaining all the way through. It's properly funny, intriguing, suspenseful, emotionally impactful and exciting. What's so impressive is that it easily rises to the top of its genre, standing amongst the best of its peers (and even, in itself, commenting on them), despite being released when that very same genre was still in its infancy. It stands tall as apparent 'kid' fare that's far more mature than most 'adult' - or, at least, 'teen' - stuff being produced even today (over ten years after its release). It's effortlessly enjoyable and wonderfully conceived. Really, it's just incredible. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Pretty good movie, but nothing incredible","This is a pretty good movie. The animation is nice. The jokes are pretty funny. The plot is very original and humorous. But better than Return of the Jedi or Terminator 2? I really don't think it's that great.I personally feel that this movie is somewhat over-hyped. Sure it was a funny family film (which is uncommon and quite a feat), but should that put it over classic films such as the ones I just mentioned? I really don't think so. It is a good film, but not a great film, and does not deserve to be ranked among great films.A good film, but overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Excellent Pixar film, not the best one, but still very good!","I wasn't expecting The Incredibles to be as good as it was, it was inventive, funny and original, all the things that I look for in an animated film. I don't think it is Pixar's best, that's Toy Story, but it's certainly not the weakest, that's Cars though that was a worthy film as well. The animation is spot on, and just adds to the inventive feel of the film, and is helped enormously by an innovative plot that is the source of the film's originality. The story is very fast-paced, if perhaps a little slow to begin with, and the script is filled with humour to satisfy even the fussiest child. The characters are very well-done, thanks to the excellent voice cast, standouts are Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, and My Name is Earl's Jason Lee is a big surprise as the villain Syndrome. Brad Bird's Edna was a hoot too. The film however, does have two flaws, it is overlong and sometimes drags consequently, and it is a little too violent at times, the last half-hour especially. Overall, an excellent family film, not perfect, but anybody who's seen some of the Disney direct to video sequels, save one or two exceptions will agree that the Incredibles does a much better job at entertaining than they did. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
A bewildering combination of brilliance and despondent  themes,"I want to congratulate director Brad Bird on one of the most original animated opening sequences I've seen. From the very start of the film, the viewer is all ready to submerge into a film that takes animation and ""children's entertainment"" to a whole new level, and this level isn't just pretentious gibber concocted to look revolutionary. This is the real thing. And it's almost a superb film. But I must take strong, even drastic conflict with the underlying themes that the film presents. What makes the ""The Incredibles"" both excellent and reprehensible is Bird's writing that unfortunately overlooks and neglects aspects in it's presentation. At least I hope so. The film leaps back and forth from a respectable animated film into something dark and ugly, and, amongst such, paints a gloss over it and claims accessibility to children. It is such a fact that I pray is never repeated.Bird's writing flounders in the very fact that it is trying to promote a message, and not a silly one. While doing so in the context of a superhero film, the film meanders back and forth from being real and fantastical. Essentially, the film can't decide what it wants to be. Does it want to pay homage to classic comics where elements of our reality are taken for granted or does it want to portray a strange new world where supers are taken out of context and applied a different role in the society? That is, the film begs to be taken as some kind or allegory, at the time maintaining, even emphasizing it's seriousness. The film contains fantastic voice work from the whole cast involved, and toward the middle of the film there are some impressively convincing moments of drama and suspense. What is further done with this is utterly disappointing. The film sporadically morphs back into a comic book where the lives of everyone except our heroes are meaningless, as is the physical and emotional pain of these characters. Some situations that involve very serious acts perpetuated by the protagonists are never resolved and are thusly deemed as acceptable. This is evident from the very start of the film when our hero, who's personality is much more like the appearances of the characters in ""Monster's Inc"", derides the talent of the soon-to be powerful villain as a youngster and never cares to say anything about it until years later, when the tables are turned. The film's message is to point out that ""no, we aren't all special"", and I can live with that to a certain degree because it's true for the most part. But one wonders if these certain facts are necessary for smaller children to digest? Perhaps this film isn't for them at all, and that's fine. What do I as an older person think? I think these themes scream some pretty reprehensible notions, and it killed any entertaining factor that ""The Incredibles"" had, as well as making me dislike the characters. Aside from our hero's treatment of Buddy and his hardly fairly matched boss in the beginning, when you view what occurred in terms of the film's overall theme it fails to mesh into anything we'd think as admirable if you're the average caring person. Buddy's child-like enthusiasm for his talent is not a bad thing, but it is treated as such. One talent is favored over the other, and I'm not sure why. Justifably, Buddy seeks out to be like his ex-hero and is killed for it. Wait, I'm completely aware of Buddy, who's later turned into Syndrome, is a serial killer. But what can we say about the depiction of a struggling person desperate to be labeled what is considered ""special"" as a vicious murderer? Something just isn't right here. It isn't helped by the very fact that virtually every non-super is either looney or negative in nature.There are further questionable sequences in the film, including the aforementioned violence occurring toward the end, that even while in self-defense, it is not believable when compared to the same intensity of other scenes involving the protagonists in mortal danger. I certainly do demand that films, despite the lowered standards for family entertainment, be further observed beyond their entertainment value or admittedly very good direction. Still, the film is also to be commended for it's artistic landscape, a somewhat 1950's universe laden with modernist design. A true rarity animation for adults is, and this so disappointingly has to offend in an unusual and problematic way.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredible Mediocrity,"Am I missing something here? When this movie came out last year everyone went on about it like it cured cancer. Well I just saw it on DVD. What is remotely new about this movie? Nothing. It's nice visually, but so what? I thought it was going to be a biting, snide and outrageous parody. Instead we get the same old family dynamics and boring ""be yourself"" speeches.A few minor jokes about expanding waistlines do not carry a movie. And frankly, too much action leaves me numb and animated action even more so. The whole idea of the stay-at-home (not to mention incredibly NAGGING) mother was a bit tired. And I thought the black character was really insulting. Was it necessary for him to be a jive-talking stereotype?

INCREDIBLY!!!! Creative!!,"This website has ranked this film to be one of the top 250 films ever made...You want to know something, I totally agree with this verdict!! This high definition surreal film by the master of animation...Walt Disney, evoked a successful culmination of cinematic brilliance on a myriad of artistic production levels!! An accomplishment like this epitomizes the term ""entertaining"" in it's most resounding form!! In evaluating the initial premise of this film, it compounds the dilemma of the proverbial glory days being a thing of the past!! A guy who was a football hero in his school days whereby it was routine to score four touchdowns in a game, and eventually, it fades due to a knee injury or being out of shape or something, this signifies that his best days are over!! When a former head cheerleader who was the starlight of every male's eye, who counted on her good looks, and she loses them, her best days are over as well!! So too is the case of a family of superheroes who leaped through buildings at a single bound in a vigilante crusade to capture nefarious criminals!! Ultimately, their vicarious damage to buildings and citizens meant that the municipality had to insulate itself from any further pecuniary culpability, and relocate them!! This would seemingly suggest that the Incredible's best days are behind them also!! As is the case with so many has beens, the end result winds up being a case of the breadwinner getting relegated to the monotonous plight of an inane job such as an insurance salesman. Such mediocrity reduces the Mr and Mrs to the state of being sedentary and overly mortgaged!! This movie depicts how even a family of manufactured stick people representing the world of fantasy, cannot hide from the afflictions of mid-life crises!!!! The ultimate undoing in these superhero's lives are the non-visceral elements of banality such as; indemnity forms, traffic jams and paranoid nightmares about deteriorating marital trust!! Just as someone wants to be a star football player,or a head cheerleader, all over again, these Incredibles wish to return to their exciting lives as the superheroes who took on capital crime!! Such a plot is very innovative, the writing in this dressed up doggerel of entertainment was remarkable!! This movie has a succinctly homogeneous blend of voices which induce an appropriately heinous cacophony of emotions which effectively illustrate exuberance and despair!! The sound effects were outstanding in this movie!! The cinematography in ""The Incredibles"" was superb!! Middle class hang-ups have been injected into teenage movies and television ever since ""The Simpsons"". This trademark of domestic rancor is for purposes of appealing to a broader audience range!! I found this film to be an ingenious use of satire, while mastering a digitalized analog of intelligent caricatures!! ""The Incredibles"" is not just a kid's film, or an overgrown adolescent's film, it is for everybody!! The family was called the Incredibles, the movie is called FANTASTIC!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Hulkingly Awesome Superhero Movie,"Shortest review ever: Incredible.You need more? Fine. Pixar continues an unheard streak of high-quality storytelling and captivating creativity with 2004's answer to the question, ""is there happiness in the world?"" The Incredibles takes place in a world where super-strength, super-speed, super-cool superpowers exist and heroes are adored by the masses they protect. Yet because of impending lawsuits and municipal damages, the government has stepped in to insure our heroes' secret identities are now their only identities. Bob Parr aka Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) is struggling with his new ""normal"" life married to fellow superhero Elastigirl aka Helen (Holly Hunter). His job sucks, the kids have superpowers of their own they're itching to explore and he desperately misses the thrill of crime fighting. In comes a mysterious benefactor who just might be his ticket to a better life.The Incredibles is Pixar's first real attempt at a completely human world populated by four limbed humanoids as opposed to toys or fishes or bugs. Instead of opting for close-to-human features, which most people find creepy, the characters are exaggerated and cartoony. But don't let that fool you into thinking the details of this marvelous film aren't spectacular. The settings range from Tropical Island to bustling metropolis and exhibit a unique feel and personality. The animators must have taken years out of their lives to complete a film of this caliber.Yet even if the film wasn't as technically brilliant as it is, it'd still have a great story populated by great characters. Each main character is a new spin on the typical nuclear family with Bob being the lovable but unrealized provider who needs help with his priorities. Helen is the overworked mother, wife and voice of reason yet unlike the valium-taking housewives of the 1950's she can kick all kinds of butt. In tow are three precocious, bickering children: Dash (Spencer Fox) who possesses super-speed, Violet (Sarah Vowell) who has the power of invisibility much like many young teenagers feel they do and Jack-Jack a toddler seemingly lacking superpowers. Also in the mix is the nefarious villain Syndrome (Jason Lee) who reeks of abandonment issues and riotous Edith Head parody Edna Mode (Director Brad Bird) who nearly steals the movie.I'm honestly surprised that a story like this hasn't been done before. There might be some serials back in the day that expounded on similar themes but I cannot recall any. Sure there are elements of superheroes turned unsanctioned vigilantes in Batman-lore and The Watchmen and The Fantastic Four does have familial ties. But mixing these two themes and adding in a cottage industry in superhero costumes; that's not just new to film but to superherodom.If on the off-chance you were trapped underneath something heavy for the last ten years and haven't seen The Incredibles, I recommend that you go and see what you've been missing. It's a brilliant original story, artfully crafted to perfection by the dream-makers of Pixar and voiced by smartly casted actors. Did I also mention it's a non-stop thrill ride unlike any other? Well believe me when I tell you that it truly is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Great Family Film,"Okay, by now, it's unanimous that Pixar's ""The Incredibles"" is a great family film. So why add another review? It's not because I think I'll say anything that a plethora of other reviewers hasn't already said, but because I feel the ~need~ to say that this is a great family film.Too many movies barely pass for family films these days. They oftentimes contain elements and themes to which we do not wish to have our children exposed. They even, more often than not, contain messages or morals with which we do not agree and find awkward or inappropriate to explain to our children. They even promote lifestyle choices, hereditary and/or cultural differences, or unfortunate wardrobe malfunctions and still pass for family films.This is not one of those movies. The Incredibles is wholesome, witty, and clever, while appealing to all ages. You can't say that about many movies, especially today.All in all? This is a great movie, anytime you want a movie you don't mind your grandparents or young children watching.

"Wonderful animation, mediocre storyline",After Pixar's previous efforts The Incredibles may suffer by comparison. Yes the animation is wonderful and detailed but the storylne and script leave a lot to be desired. One big disappointment was that there are very few genuinely funny moments and it felt more like an animated action movie. The storyline concerns itself with individuals being proud of their talents and that everyone should try to become the best at what they excel in. This is wrapped together with what is at best a hackneyed spy or action movie storyline that is not going to win any prizes for originality.This is not a bad film but by Pixar's standards is definitely not a great one.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Great family fun,"Disney Pixar animations have delivered once again. To be honest I often wonder how these animated movies can live up to the hype created during their years of production. Toy Story did it, Shrek did it and, oh yeah, Shrek 2 did it as well. The Incredibles was different to these films. This movie is yet another superhero film, yet in animation style, and hence not only had to compete with previous computer animation films but also the Supermans and Batmans that came before it.The story begins in a fictional city where superheroes are just that, heroes. Soon the town is unhappy with the heroes efforts, lawsuits are being filed against them, and so superheroes are forced to assume their secret identities. Mr. Incredible along with his wife Elastigirl are forced to live normal lives and bring up 3 children, Violet, Dash and JJ. Mr. Incredible, frustrated with his insurance job seeks to find a challenge, a way to utilize his super strength, and so the trouble begins I must say that I was impressed with the films adult wit and humor, once again in line with that of films such as Shrek, and this heightened my interest during some of the film's duller moments.In my opinion the movie went for half an hour longer than necessary, dwelling on the ""boring"" lives of the superheroes and frankly leaving the action until the end of the picture, by which time half of the audience had fallen asleep.Despite this one drawback (yet not a small one) the film was funny, graphically awesome and all-round entertaining, a fantastic family film that all can enjoy.Rating 7.5",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The greatest adventure of 2004!,"The Incredibles is further proof Pixar focuses more on story and characters rather than in-jokes and celebrity voices, as in Dreamworks'features (not that there's anything wrong with that, just look at Shrek 1 AND 2). Okay, there are quite a lot of pop-culture references in this film, because of the story, but that doesn't stop The Incredibles from being an... incredible movie.For the first time in a Pixar film, the main characters are human: Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) used to be a great superhero, Mr.Incredible, until such activities became illegal (fans of Alan Moore may find that concept familiar). Now he has to deal with a boring job and his family: wife Helen (Holly Hunter), aka Elastigirl, and three kids, Dash (who's called Flash in the Italian version, guess why), Violet(who's got the same powers as Marvel's Invisible Woman) and baby Jack-Jack, who so far seems to be ""normal"". He's desperate to return to the old glorious days, not realizing his family is the ""greatest adventure ever"". And their help will be needed when a new threat shows up...The film's best element is the script, which teaches a valuable lesson (family matters more than anything) while providing some jaw-dropping action scenes (no wonder the movie got a PG rating) and various references to the genre (almost every existing superhero is poked at, as well as James Bond and Indiana Jones). The other awesome thing is of course the characters: the titular family is basically the ""super"" version of the Simpsons (Bob getting home from work is pure Homer), and two supporting characters deserve a special mention. One is Frozone, Mr.Incredible's buddy, the only one in the movie who's voiced by a real star (Samuel L. Jackson, who's a gas as usual). The most important one, though, is Edna Mode, who makes the supers' outfits. Wonderful and hilarious, she's one of the best animated characters in years (ironically enough, she's voiced by a man, the movie's writer/director, Brad Bird).For those who really love movies, The Incredibles is a must-see in the animated feature category.

The most fun I've had at the movies all year,"I cannot say enough about the cleverness of the writing and the animation of this film. Even the animated acting was better than many live action films. The story, about what happens to a group of superheros when the public turns against them and they are forced to go underground and be normal, and then a tricked back into action, is so well thought out that hardly a moment or a shot passes in which there is not some small brilliant detail that catches you off guard and amuses. Even the music is funny. When Mr. Incredible is creeping around the island fortress of the evil Sundrome the music is strikingly suggestive of the kind of tense themes John Barry would write for James Bond's infiltration of the island fortress in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE and many others. The Incredibles is particularly striking, I think, for those of us who grew up reading comic books regularly because it gives answers to fun questions like, where does a superhero go when he needs a new costume? I cannot recommend it enough for both kids and adults.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The Unremarkables...,"Though well made, sometimes very funny and imaginative, in the end THE INCREDIBLES could just as well be called The Unremarkables. While certainly a nice job is done by all, THE INCREDIBLES has the poor fortune to follow Pixar's other masterpieces to the screen and can't rise out of the shadows of the TOY STORY films, MONSTERS, INC. and FINDING NEMO. THE INCREDIBLES sets it sites higher than those films, as far as its outlandish story goes, but while its save-the-world adventure seems more grand in comparison to the seemingly mundane antics of the other films' miniature characters, the story comes off as being really rather ordinary.THE INCREDIBLES has really nothing new to offer, just an odd juxtaposition of old ideas and clichés from the two genres it grafts together. In tying together the world of the typical family sitcom with the premise of a routine superhero adventure, the film seeks originality, but the most remarkable thing about the film is that it shows that superhero tales have become just as mundane as your typical family sitcom.I think the magic of Pixar's previous efforts comes from more than just the wonderful artwork. Those films took us to other worlds or forced us to look at our world from a different perspective. THE INCREDIBLES goes from everyday suburbia to the inner sanctum of a mad genius out to control the world and the sad reality is that we have already been to the latter as often, if not more so, than the former. Saving the world is just not what it used to be; on the heels of James Bond, Spider-Man, Superman and an endless list of others, what The Incredibles do is old hat. And let's face it, in the toon world what these characters do is not that big of a deal either; from Bugs Bunny and Wiley Coyote to Goofy and Roger Rabbit, being indestructible and defying the laws of physics are pretty common tricks.Everything THE INCREDIBLES offers -- strength, speed, flexibility, invisibility -- has a been-there-done-that quality. All the classic cartoon characters were, to one extent or another, already superhuman.As such, superheroism in the toon world is a given; it is when the gifts that defy physics and common sense are endowed on real actors that the genre still has a sense of awe. When Christopher Reeve flies, when Tobey Maguire swings, when James Bond whips out Q's gadgets or Indiana Jones cracks his whip, the images still carry a kick -- men doing what cartoon characters take for granted. We can live vicariously through Superman or James Bond, but how often do we fantasize being Donald Duck or even Underdog?To me, the Incredibles' derring-do pales in comparison to the toys in TOY STORY figuring out how to drive a car or the great aquarium escape in FINDING NEMO. Just as much imagination may have been expended in helping The Incredibles save New York City, but how many times have we seen New York saved in recent years? On the other hand, the trip through the closet to Monstropilis was a wonderful new experience.This is not to say that THE INCREDIBLES is a bad or unrewarding. Indeed, it was worth it just to hear Holly Hunter as Elastigirl -- with that voice she was born to do cartoon voiceovers.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
A Superhero movie with real Superheroes.,"I am on a superhero high. I've had so much of them that I have finally learnt to shoot laser from my eyes; really. Most of it has been bad. I felt that the superhero days were over. A certain desolateness was creeping into my hapless existence. Desperate times call for desperate measures. I stole my hot, blonde neighbour's Porsche, drove at jet speed to my nearest retail store, ran down two priests, a banshee and a flatulent Eskimo on my way and bought a DVD of The Incredibles. That digital versatile disk didn't work, so I sued the shopkeeper and did the stealing, running over and buying thing again. I plugged it in and blissfully slipped into an animated world of action, comedy and some real superheroes.The reel rolls with an expected action sequence. Mr. Incredible (voice by Craig T. Nelson) catches thieves, prevents a man from committing suicide, saves a cat and is about to defeat Bon Voyage when an intrusion by his 'biggest fan' results in large scale loss of public property and the escaping of the criminal. Suddenly, the public is angry at these virtuous vigilantes and they are forced underground.Fifteen years later Robert Parr is facing a midlife crisis. He has married Helena Parr, formerly Elastigirl (voice by Holly Hunter), has helped increase the world population by three and works in an insurance firm under an obnoxious boss, who soon fires him. On the same day he gets a message from a mysterious woman who provides him with another shot at long lost glory. It is a clandestine operation and hidden from the scrutinizing eye of his family, Mr. Incredible returns to business.In all fairness, animated movies have a definite advantage over non- animated ones. The former don't have to worry about testy actors, bad weather and other such misfortunes that plague the unfortunate latter. If The Incredibles was not an animated movie, it wouldn't have been as good a movie as it otherwise was. However, it IS an animated movie and that puts things in a whole new perspective.As many detractors would say, the concept isn't highly original per se and it is difficult to contradict them. However, undeniably, The Incredibles was a fresh watch. It was a surprise in 2004, releasing before Nolan's Batman, Ironman and other recent hits.The four protagonists are extremely well characterized and do not end up becoming tropes. They are affable, endearing and with a baby named Jack- Jack, make a good little superhero family. The side –cast too (Frozone, Edna, Mirage) too manage to carve their own identity, each of them being memorable. The antagonist, Syndrome, leaves more to be desired. He should have been more evil, more clever, more mysterious and more everything else Supervillians need to be.The film loses out slightly because of being predictable. At every point in the movie you can foretell how the events are going to unfold next. As a result of which nothing surprises you. Everything happens exactly how you had expected it to. What could have been an amazing entertainer becomes a clichéd entertainer. It lacks the ingenuity that other PIXAR films bring with them. It is a pity because an otherwise brilliant movie slips into mediocrity due to this error.The Incredibles scores well on other fronts. It does well to wring emotions out of you. Your kids, who are also the target audience, are going to love it. The kid in me did. They will be enthralled by the effects, action and superpowers, and in all likelihood won't begrudge the movie for the above mentioned reasons.And to top it all, like all PIXAR releases, this one too is subtly heart-warming. How does one complain against that?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Pixar's second best movie, but only just...","Nemo just slightly edges this out for me, but this movie is great just the same. It is filled with the kind of things that makes a life long superhero nerd smile and laugh. This is the story of a family of superheros that have adapted to civilian life. The reason for this? As the world became more litigious, people that were hurt collaterally by superheros started to sue for their injuries. This plot device is genius because it is so very believable. After years in retirement Bob Parr, AKA Mr. Incredible gets recruited for a mission by a mysterious person. Of course the person that recruits Bob has nefarious intentions, and unleashes a seemingly indestructible machine on the world. It is us the the Parrs, Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, Violet and Dash, along with the family friend Frozone to save the day. I love that they cast Sam Jackson in the role as Frozone, because his super power is making ice, and Sam Jackson is the coolest MF out there. This is a great movie, not just from an animation stand point, but in the whole realm of superhero films as well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Technically beautiful,"Wow.. This movie is technically breathtaking. The character animations, the scenery and the voices (Samuel Jackson is perfect in his role) are top notch. One can only imagine the thousands of hours that were necessary to create this technical masterpiece. This is another impressing performance from Pixar.The plot of the movie is also both original and entertaining. It manages to be enjoyable for both kids and adults.The pure humor part may not be as strong and consistent as in Finding Nemo but nevertheless Incredibles succeeds in making you smile on several occasions.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Fun action movie,"This movie was a lot of fun. Mr. Incredible and his family are forced to conceal their identities and their powers. Pretending to be something they're not makes everyone miserable and creates problems in the family, especially between Mr. Incredible and his wife. Dash gets in trouble at school, and Violet is painfully shy. But after getting an opportunity to act as supers again, they rediscover their powers and who they are. All of them become better people, and they also discover the strength of working together as a family. The movie is also packed with action. It's very fast paced, and there are ample explosions to please viewers looking for excitement. At the same time, it's still very family friendly. I'd watch this again in the future.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Pixar have done it yet again,"After the enormous success of 'Finding Nemo' and the two Toy Story films, we can probably count on a lot more CGI animated films to come from Pixar; but if they're all as good as The Incredibles, that's certainly no bad thing. The Incredibles works principally because it strikes a fine balance between the fun kids movie that it's facade suggests it is, and a movie of substance. That's why Pixar's animations work; there's something for everyone. Younger audiences will enjoy the high paced action and quick one-liners, while older audiences can delight in the themes of loss, family and doing what you're good at; while having a blast at the same time. The Incredibles is based on an absurdly funny idea, which sees superhero couple Mr Incredible and Elastigirl, along with the rest of the superhero world, having to take regular jobs after a series of law-suits are filed against superhero's after a number of their saves went wrong. However, Mr Incredible simply doesn't like his new life; so when an offer of a superhero assignment comes along; he just can't turn it down...The way that the film portrays the superhero's' family life is really well done and echoes serious American classics such as American Beauty. This, tied in with the quirky characters and their superpowers, makes for some very fun viewing. It's also refreshing to see an animated film tackle this sort of drama as many skip it in favour of more audience-pleasing aspects (not that this film lacks the latter, mind you). The animation is, of course, sublime and is at least as good, if not better, than the animation seen in Finding Nemo. The film also benefits from a talented range of actors providing the characters' voices. Unlike certain other studios, Pixar are more concerned with getting the right voice actor in for the job rather than having another name to add to the poster. Of course, Samuel L. Jackson and Holly Hunter stand out; but the rest of the cast is mostly made up of lesser-known actors, and all bring their characters to life brilliantly. On the whole, The Incredibles is a great piece of entertainment. Brad Bird has created his own cinematic world and it's one that isn't afraid to latch onto the clichés of the superhero tradition and make them it's own. Simply put; this is an incredible film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Why is this so popular?,"This film is from another from the much acclaimed Pixar company which have made other hits such as Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life and Monsters Inc, and F.N. and B.L. were pleasant enough (M.I. was pretty poor) so it was slightly unexpected to see Pixar deliver us this dull and unoriginal script for a superhero flick.The Incredibles lacks the intelligent humour which has made so many animated movies in the past decade appeal to all members of the family and it tries to make up for this with poor references to things parents might know and it works with the concept of superheroes who can't just use their powers and have the glory in the world we live in. This is a good concept for a movie to work from as it hasn't been tackled particularly successfully in the past but unfortunately, this doesn't do the job any better and we are left wondering how such a mundane and 'going by the numbers' movie has made so much money. But then we realise, any society which can enable rubbish such as Titanic, Harry Potter and Wedding Crashers to make money will give any movie a chance.I guess I'm in the minority with these views but I'm sure people will come round to my way of thinking and make the movie industry deliver us better comedy than this tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
One of the best.,"This is one of the best animated films of all time.Not only is it probably gonna end up being the best Pixar movie, but it is easily in my top 5 animated movies ever. Like Toy Story, you just cannot beat the vibe of this film. You are never not entertained during this. I watched this like 30 times as a kid, so on top of it being incredible, it was also nostalgic. It's really funny, a great story, great villain, great music, great everything. So far this is my favorite Pixar film, and I don't know if it's gonna change anytime soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Fun for the Whole Family,"This film for Pixar has to be one of their greatest achievements. Many of their movies revolve around animals who have feelings, but The Incredibles is a nice change of pace from that usual plot line.The Incredibles tells the story of the Parr family, a family of undercover superheroes, who try to fit in to suburban life after being told by the government they most go into hiding. Some of the superheroes wish the old days of crime fighting would return while some wish that they could be normal rather than just pretending to be.Stakes are raised as the film continues to show the stories of each character and how they react to the events that happen around them. The film has great characters that are more than two dimensional story conveyors. The writing is superb and will entertain adults just as much as it will kids.The Incredibles is a fresh breath of air brought to animated films by writer/director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant, Ratatouille). The story he made for the audience is one that is intricate and deep. It deserves to be remembered as one of the Pixar greats.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"The Incredibles: Pixar's Superhero Family Delivers Action, Heart, and Humor","""The Incredibles"" is a thrilling and engaging animated superhero film that showcases Pixar's impressive storytelling and animation skills. Director Brad Bird expertly blends humor, action, and heart to create a film that is both entertaining and meaningful.The film follows the Parr family, who must use their superpowers to stop a dangerous villain from destroying the city. The characters are well-developed and relatable, with each family member facing their own personal struggles in addition to the overarching conflict. The voice acting is also top-notch, with Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter delivering standout performances as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl.What sets ""The Incredibles"" apart from other superhero films is its focus on family dynamics and the challenges of balancing personal and professional responsibilities. The film explores themes of identity, self-worth, and the importance of teamwork, all while delivering exciting action sequences and laugh-out-loud humor.Visually, ""The Incredibles"" is a feast for the eyes. The animation is colorful, vibrant, and detailed, with intricate character designs and stunning action set pieces. The score by Michael Giacchino perfectly complements the film's tone and pacing.Overall, ""The Incredibles"" is a must-see for fans of animation and superhero films alike. With its compelling characters, thrilling action, and heartfelt message, it is a film that will appeal to audiences of all ages.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
One of Pixar's best,"The Incredibles was one of Pixar's best films. I didn't find it as good as Ratatouille, Wall-E and Up, but it wasn't as bad as Brave, or as pedestrian as Finding Nemo. It is a very long (for US standards) animated feature at 110 minutes and has much more complexity and character development than the usual animated fare made in the US: this is a family film that adults will like nearly as much as the children (though not 100% as much).It is full of action but nobody appear to die in the film besides the villain: in one scene Mr. Incredible throws a massive metal thing over some guards and they are only disabled. It is a James Bond and superhero spoof, a very well executed one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Semi-Fantastic Four.,"Superheroes have to go into hiding ala the witness protection program after civilians start to take advantage by suing the gifted ones in crazed lawsuits. Now all superheroes must live as their alter egos in a world where having special powers is frowned upon all of a sudden. The patriarch of the titled family though becomes the target of a deviant individual who was once his biggest fan. Thus it is up to his family to save him so the group can save the world once more. ""The Incredibles"" is strong with its animation, but honestly the story is hit-and-miss. Hanna and Barbara-styled ideas from the 1960s and 1970s mix with that dark comic book look that was so prevalent in the 1930s and 1940s to form a long (and I do mean long) cartoon that suffers an identity crisis with its tone and pace. The characters have their moments, but most are not as interesting as they look. Director Brad Bird has crafted a film that definitely has more upside than down because of its glossy look and hot visuals. However, I still think that a little more time could have been spent on the script and on the movie's potential uniqueness. Unfortunately, ""The Incredibles"" really pales to most recent computer generated productions. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Cute little adventure films, with a hint of elitism...","This is more of the good stuff we have come to expect from Pixar. It has memorable characters, funny dialog, and lots of action. In the movie, superheroes have all been forced to retire due to liability issues. Their super-battles did so much damage that society has decided to battle evil the old-fashioned way. Mr. Incredible and Elsatigirl try to make a go at ""normal"" family life and forget their super-ness. However, Mr. I cannot let go of the old days, and his longing is manipulated by an evil genius to perfect killer robots. Soon, the whole family must emerge from normal life and use their super powers to bring down the bad guy. Thrilling action sequences and witty dialog ensue.If you want to find something wrong with this film, the only obvious flaw is that it is formulaic in plot and the characters are recycled from some comic book or another (in fact, the three quarters of the family is very similar to Marvel's ""Fantastic Four"": a strong man, a stretchable person, a girl who can turn invisible and create force fields).An added bonus to this film are the philosophical nuggets it throws out. There is an obvious message that one should be true to one's self, instead of trying to conform to society. More subtle is the constant barbs against normal people the superheroes make. They bridle against the mediocrity that they are expected to imitate. The bad guy was not born with super powers, but made himself super through his hard work and inventive genius. The bad guy goes so far as to threaten to provide the world with inventions that will give all people super powers. Mr. Incredible opines that if all people are super powerful, than nobody is super.What does it mean? Do the Incredibles represent old inhertied wealth, despising the crassness of the nouveaux riches bad guy? Is it better to simply be born with advantages, or to create one's own opportunities?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Fun for children and adults,"Well done animation that seems fun. The animation offers a great way to perform 'special effects' magically. The challenge is the 'car chase' scenes seem to drag on, since they are so much easier to do with animation. It seems like there is a lot of 'we can do it so let us do it'This cartoon seems to drag, but has a great theme and fun focus on family superheros. There is a great amount of adult fun, to go with the child level of entertainment. This seems to have the standard trend of getting more morals and value oriented with each film coming out of Hollywood.The voices and players of this animation are wonderful and definitely bring the story to life.A fun way to enjoy some popcorn, and remember even superhero's grow away from their passions and dreams if we don't stay on track.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

"Feels overrated, especially when you consider what Pixar is capable of!","This must be a hot take, and I'm sure what about to say wouldn't sit well with the audience, but like I always say, I've got to stick to my feelings and state with utmost honesty that I found this film to be just above average, nothing unique!Yes, I can already sense all those frowning eyes on me. I must have your attention now, don't I?Look, before you throw a barrage of cuss words at me and get infuriated, let me clarify something; I did not find it bad, nor am I implying it was a forgettable experience; all I'm saying is that I don't get the hype and that has more to do with me and my developed taste and preference rather than the movie itself.I have seen it for the first time today, and perhaps it's because of the over-saturation of superhero content nowadays or the exhaustion that caught up to me; I was finding it very difficult to connect.

NO CAPES!(The voice nailed so perfectly by the director they were told not to replace it)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
One of my All-Time Favourites,"First of all, everything technically is more or less perfect. From the brilliantly stylised animation, character design, settings and background design and animation effects that were ground-breaking for the art form, to quite possibly my favourite score of all time from Michael Giacchino that I've been humming more or less constantly since I watched it, to the creative and extremely enjoyable action that uses all of the family's powers to their advantage, every technical aspect is just phenomenal. The voice acting is energetic, the characters are really iconic and their interactions are the main driving force of the film. I love the fact that, underneath the superhero aspect of their lives, this is just a normal family with normal interactions, which grounds the characters in a sense of reality and makes them a lot more enjoyable to watch, particularly in the final act. Brad Bird is pretty much a master at writing dialogue that appeals to both kids and adults, and the amount of layers that some of the dialogue has makes me shocked that a film like this was even made. There are a lot of darker undertones, such as Helen thinking that Bob is cheating on her, to Bob feeling like his life no longer has any meaning to it. It again makes the characters so much more enjoyable to watch and makes the story so much more layered. The pacing is pretty much pitch perfect, and Syndrome is one of the best villains of all time - he's charismatic, funny and just a blast to see on screen. Also, the film is just so funny. So many iconic lines (And when everyone's super no one will be) (Where is my supersuit?), (Edna Mode in general) and so many great jokes (Coincidence? I think NOT!), and it makes the film ridiculously fun from start to finish. It's hard to choose a favourite element, but I think I'll go for the fact that every main character has a well developed arc, with Bob learning to reconnect with his family, particularly Helen, and Helen becoming a more motherly figure over her kids. Violet becomes more confident and Dash becomes more mature and appreciates his family more by the end of the film.But more importantly, this has had a big impact on how I view animation. Even before I was really into film, my first big obsession was with animation. Not that I was any good at actually making animations, but I just found the way that animation was created really interesting, and my favourite animation studio was always and is still Pixar. I wouldn't say The Incredibles was one I fully appreciated until a bit after this phase, but it was one I always really enjoyed as a kid. It's grown on me gradually over the years to the point where it is now amongst my favourites of my favourites of all time. This film is one of the key reasons why I love animation so much, and in a way, it lead to my appreciation of superhero movies aswell. Overall, this is one of my favourites of all time for all of the reasons that I've listed above and more, and if you haven't already watched this, or if it's been a while since you've seen it, I implore that you check it out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Super(b)! Pixar Does It Again! One of the Year's Best!,"THE INCREDIBLES (2004) **** (VOICES of: Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee, Sarah Vowell, Spencer Fox, Elizabeth Pena, Brad Bird, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger) (Dir: Brad Bird) Pixar does it again! Wonderfully funny and fast-paced animated valentine to comic book heroes with a unique spin: the titular family of action heroes are part of a federal witness relocation program - after society has deemed them too 'special' resulting in far-too-many legal woes  that eventually find themselves back fighting the good fight when Mr. Incredible (Nelson in square-jawed jocularity) faces a new enemy in the form of Syndrome (Lee, having a snarky field day), a former fan of the superhero who has now made it his life's mission to off his one-time would-be mentor, while attempting to raise a family with Elastigirl (the ever feisty and able Hunter) with varied results.Excellently cast  especially NPR personality Vowell as the Incredible' eldest, painfully shy daughter (love the curtain of hair-one-eye look!) Violet and Fox as the middle, precocious tow-headed son (aptly named) Dash who both are becoming aware of their 'specialness' as adolescence beckons (metaphors aplenty!) Jackson lends able support as fellow hero Frozone, a (literally) cool dude bud of the family as well as the ever irrepressible Shawn as the pip-squeaked 'boss' of Mr. Incredible's alias Bob Parr, an insurance claims adjustor; and Pena as a femme fatale named Mirage who bares more than a striking resemblance to Gwyneth Paltrow morphed with a pipe cleaner. But it is director Bird who steals the show voicing the fashionista/costume designer Edna E. Mode  think Linda Hunt meets Edith Head  in a hilarious no-holds-barred slap of surreality to the reluctantly returning superheroes into the fray. Bird is also no slouch in keeping the breakneck pace and overall retro '50s/'60s look of the film (think those Rankin Bass holiday animated specials) while expertly sifting pop culture in-the-knowisms to the genre at hand. What is most surprising is the warmhearted emotion that is on display with the gut-busting comedy juggling act of breathless action. One of the year's best films.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredible Superhero Film,"The Incredibles is Brad Bird's movie about a family of superheroes that's produced by Pixar. It has very deep storytelling like typical Pixar films. After some legal issues, these heroes who were looked up to like gods were then looked like outcasts, kinda like them being the Avengers and then turned to like how mutants are in Marvel (outcasted due to their mutations that give them powers). After some time, Mr. Incredible (the father) wanted to relive the glory days and took an offer that'll allow it after losing his job. Doing that, it gives the deepness and some darkness to the story. It does have themes that would be continued in the second like standing up for what you believe in/what's right, trust, and technology.I find the Incredibles is one of my favorite Pixar movies, alongside Wall-E, Toy Story, Inside Out, Coco, and Soul. It definitely has the best villain in any Pixar film in Syndrome. He has brilliant setup/origins, goals, and plans and that makes him a top tier villain.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Valiant, but off the Pixar mark","Toy Story, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, A Bug's Life. Heard of them? Well you don't need to have kids to have a strong recollection of these computer-animated gems. The fact that all four of them are in the Top-100 grossing domestic films of all-time prove that there is both an audience and a lucrative back end for the studio's to keep pumping these out with some regularity.In fact, while the four earlier mentioned titles represent films from Pixar Studio's and Disney, other animation sects like Dreamworks (which has given us both Shrek films) and Fox Studio (Ice Age) have jumped on the bandwagon. No less than eight computer animated feature films are in the top 100-grossers of all-time. It's a statistic that can't be overlooked. And now with the new Disney/Pixar release of The Incredibles, it won't be long before The Sound of Music (1965) falls down a rung to number 101.The Incredibles is the sixth film to be produced through the rocky relationship between the Disney and Pixar studio's, and although this film has its moments, it can also be accredited as the weakest to date.A mixture of The Fantastic Four, Get Smart, James Bond and the X-Men franchise in animated form, writer/director Brad Bird (The Iron Giant) brings us the story of a superhero family that goes into the hero-protection program after a series of lawsuits cost the city too much money to enlist or endorse their services. Promising to keep their powers a secret and never again perform super heroic duties, they are given new identities, jobs and a suburban life that is made even more monotonous by the fact that they could be saving lives or flying the skies like the glory days of yesteryear.It is with their everyday lives that the movie has its sharpest moments. Seeing Mr. Incredible and his hulking size squeezed into an office cubicle and dealing with an interfering boss and needy customers was a subdued delight and much more interesting than when he dons the costume and begins again to fight crime. Watching the children try and contain their powers in the pressures of everyday school life was also an interesting premise that I had hoped the film would have spent more time.However, it is the action that puts bums in seats and although the story might not be as interesting, there is plenty of fast paced chaos to keep the average moviegoer from napping. After Mr. Incredible gets a taste of the heroic life he once lead its like a shark to blood or me to a buffet table. He just can't get enough. However, all this is done behind the back of his wife and family who only come to the revelation of his alter-life when he is captured by the evil Syndrome (voiced by Mallrats' Jason Lee). In an effort to find their father and ultimately rescue mankind, the family lead by Elasticgirl and including children who posses the powers of speed (Dash) and invisibility and force fields (Violet) set out to a remote island that would have Ian Fleming grinning from ear to ear to take on the bad guys.The action sequences on the island are quite clever and include razor cutting ships that chase the children through the forest and enough machine gun fire to earn Pixar their first ever PG rating. But for all the menace and action that ensues, the villain might be the major problem with this venture. As the evil Syndrome, the tyrant doesn't really have any character and comes off as boring and as plain as any enemy of James Bond during the Timothy Dalton years. As the focal point to the second half of the movie, this weak development holds the film down like an anchor in a canoe.But, for all its small issues, this is still a valued effort. Pixar is still a force to be reckoned with and the movie will made bags and bags of money. It's just that put side-by-side against its peers, it just doesn't have the same humor, originality and tempo. Too bad.www.gregsrants.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Ordinary Heroes ... Super Family ...,"For his directorial debut in the Pixar Studios, Brad Bird had an idea of genius.Indeed, ""The Incredibles"" is two things: a superhero movie genre with all the predictable archetypes and it's a commentary on the restraining uniformity of American suburban life. That ""super hero/ ordinary family"" contrast is the core of the film and the inspiration for its greatest moments. This achievement is even more remarkable given how familiar we are with these archetypes, yet they work in such a symbiosis that the set-ups are always predictable but not the outcomes, and the starting gimmick reveals itself a never-ending source of fun and entertainment.The identity of superheroes and their struggle to fit in the real life is an overused theme but because we're watching a family movie, the formula is totally reversed, ""The Incredibles"" is about a 'normal family' trying to keep their super-heroic background secret, the focus is on the normal identity, not the superheroes. The first scenes are misleading: Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) has an appointment yet finds the time to save a cat, stop a bank robber, and bag thief with the providential help of Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), he meets one of his friends, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), he prevents a man from suicide, he intercepts a French villain with the suave name of Bomb Voyage, and one of his fans, a wannabe sidekick named IncrediBoy (Jason Lee) to blew it with his intervention. What a night, but he finds the time to join the church and marry the woman of his life, Elastigirl  the tone is set, the whole super-heroic stunts were just the prelude to a beautiful family story.But these stunts weren't without consequences, two of them will be particularly dramatic. The suicidal man sues Incredible for having ruined his death rather than saved his life, starting a streak of successful lawsuits where heroes are condemned to pay indemnities for undesired interventions, hence becoming a liability to the Stage government. Finally, it's decided each of them to be relocated in a sort of witness protection-like program, with the order not to ever interfere, and live in anonymity. Superheroes all have weaknesses, Kryptonites, but no one can beat the bureaucracy. The enemy is normality. And this is a constant theme as the father Incredible, now Bob Parr, can't resuscitate the old past glory and is forced to work in a cubicle for a petty boss, Helen is a devoted housewife teaching her son not to run too fast, and fit in the crowd by not being special, not the super-heroic way. This contributes to one of the best quotes : ""everyone's special"" ""which means no one is"". I love how they twist the old cliché of the little boy who can't fit, but this time in the other way.The second consequence was that the rejected sidekick will finally fill his heart with enough anger and resentment to become a supra-villain, in a mix of Lex Luthor and Spectre, in fact, many elements from ""The Incredibles"" borrows from James Bond and the 60's secret service superheroes classics, and the vintage feeling is a delight for the eyes. Even the setting looks like a futuristic view of USA as it was envisioned in the 60's, on this level, Brad Bird and team did a terrific job. Sensual secretaries, tropical landscape, launched missiles, a scene-stealing little designer, voiced by Brad Bird, and who plays the Q role, the super-heroic element is responsible for the greatest thrills while the family is the heart. This combination is the secret of ""The Incredibles"". We know the little boy Dash, will have to run faster than ever for an extreme great chase, we know Violet, the shy teenager will sure be capable to use her power to create magnetic field and impregnable bubbles, but how refreshing to share their first frustration. The kid can't run, and she's so shy she makes herself invisible.It's great to see Mr Incredible reluctant to use his force although sometime he can help it, while he breaks the car window by closing the door too strongly or lifting it out of anger, or doing something we're all dreamed of like squashing the boss in the walls, he has to wait before fully using his powers. And Helen is reluctant to wear her new outfit and when she does, she can't help but notices her curves in the mirror. The script characterization keeps us with the sensation that we're watching real people, and the super powers become almost accessory, they do contribute to a variety of actions but it's all Bob, Helen, Dash, Violet  and yes, the baby Jack-Jack whose powers are unknown yet, but we can figure that they're letting it for the last act. It's a Family film in the real meaning of the word, it's for the family and about a family.Most of the plot relies on very common clichés, but the film is much aware for them, and never hesitates to show it, denouncing the infamous monologue cliché or the way capes can become a lethal target, not to mention Samuel L. Jackson's performance, so authentic, calling it self-parody would be insult.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Not the greatest film ever made, people","People, seriously, this film was far from incredible, and at best average, yet it's being rated higher than classics like Pulp Fiction and Dr. Strangelove. While it was very well animated and had many quick hitting jokes, the story was so contrived that it was like watching The Fantastic Four with the powers switched around. The whole ""we have to conceal our powers from the world, and only use them when we have no other option"" was so very X-Men. And the message as I understood it seemed callous. If everyone has powers it's the same as no one having powers. So not everyone is special in their own way? Harsh. Isn't that what we've been trying to teach our kids all this time? Tolerance of people different than ourselves? I'll take Monsters Inc. over this film any day.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredibly boring!,"This movie could have been so much more. Unless you're a fan of the technical aspects of animation this movie is a real letdown for all but the preteens. If you take your 8 year old to see this movie I'm sure they will enjoy it and want to see it a million more times, just look at the box office for Yûgiô. Unlike the feeling you get from the trailers and promos, that is the audience that will be attracted to this movie. I left the theater with my brain feeling numb, you know, that feeling you can get when you've spent a whole Saturday morning in front of the TV watching cartoons. The feel of the animation is better than Saturday morning cartoons but the plot is the same. The characters don't develop and the inconsistencies in the plot are horrible. It is very obvious that the creators have hopes for a long running series for these characters. I couldn't shake the thought that I was watching a pilot for a bad ""Simpsons"" instead of a feature length movie.For parents of young children this movie will be great as your children will be entertained. This is doomed though to be one of those movies you will buy for your children when it comes out on DVD and then have to watch with them thousands of times. It lacks the ""smart"" type of humor that can transcend between both child and adult so prepare to be bored.All in all, this is a good movie to entertain your small children but don't expect much on an adult level. 2 of 10 for the nice animation work.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
A Great Pixar Animation!,"The Incredibles is actually a film better than I thought. I feared to see this film because it sounded boring. I was able to like this film. The story is about a former superhero who went into hiding with his family because of legal lawsuits. Fifteen years later, he wants to return to his old glory days. Now he has to fight one evil superhero to save the world. The acting/voicing in this film is great. Craig T.Nelson and Samuel Jackson were great. The story was written well.

"As cliché as it sounds, this movie is Incredible.","It is often said that there are 2 things in this world that are guaranteed: death and taxes. I would like to argue that there is a third: Pixar movies will be an instant classic. Ever since the first Toy Story was released in 1995, I have eagerly awaited the release of each new movie. When The Incredibles was released in 2004, I could not get to the theater soon enough, and needless to say, I was not disappointed. In a time when generic superhero movies are released every few months, Pixar created a superhero movie with an engaging story that focuses more on the characters than watching the heroes save the world from total destruction.The story focuses primarily on Mr. Incredible and his struggle to find meaning in life after a series of lawsuits has caused superheroes to go into hiding. The once loved superhero spends his day working a monotonous desk job and his evenings listening to a radio scanner with his friend Frozone in hopes of reliving the glory days. The story connected with me because I believe we all have the desire to live for something greater than ourselves and to find purpose in life, yet we find ourselves sitting behind a desk and never reaching our full potential. The ""superhero"" story revolves around Mr. Incredible attempting to save the world from his one-time #1 fan, now turned villain, Syndrome. This challenge brings the Incredible family together and helps them realize the importance of working as a team and realizing that their abilities should not be hidden, but used to make a difference in the world.Another area where Pixar shines is in their character development. From the insecure adolescent with the ability to disappear to the super busy mom who can stretch herself to accomplish whatever task is needed, the characters powers were brilliantly chosen to fit what power one would expect someone in that stage of life would need. Even the villain was someone that I could relate to. I'm sure most people have had someone they looked up to let them down, and although most of us do not become that person's arch-nemesis, I could feel sympathy for the guy. If anything, Syndrome's back story shows how much of an impact we can have on people who may look up to us.All of this plus the stunning computer animation, intelligent humor, and wholesome fun helps continue the company's streak of top-notch movies. It challenges the viewer to find their purpose/meaning in life while also encouraging them to accept and use whatever gifts he or she may have. Six years after its release, this movie still remains at the top of my list of favorite Pixar movies and in the top 5 of my all-time favorite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The best of Pixar's films and that is truly Incredible,"When Pixar announced that they'd recruited Brad Bird to direct their new film it was treated with surprise. Sure Bird had been a major part of the Simpsons, he'd been instrumental in creating one of the best recent cartoon features (the Iron Giant) and sure he was a breath of fresh air to the Pixar formula. But why try and fix something that is not only not broken but is positively bursting at the seams with creative energy, commercial viability and critical acclaim? The naysayers, and there were a fair few of them, urged caution and sat back to see if Pixar would make their first misstep after a series of blindingly brilliant films that had knocked their competitor from a perch that had been regarded as impregnable.Disney's misfortune had been our, the viewing public's, great reward. From their childish cartoons we'd suddenly learnt to appreciate and even prefer other possibilities, most specifically computer generated films. Toy Story had come out of nowhere to deliver a killer blow to Disney's tired remakes and uninspired sequels. Ignoring realism in favour of a fun, flexible world where reality existed but didn't automatically infringe on the entertainment, the geniuses at Pixar created a film that didn't try and reinvent the wheel but gave it such an overhaul that the finished product really did look completely new.By realising that people don't like computer generated images, particularly of human beings, which always look and move too perfectly for us to ever accept them, Pixar instead showed us a world of cute toys and giant, fairly irrelevant humans. With the voices incredibly well cast and the images sharp enough to impress without trying to blitz us with colour, Toy Story demonstrated just how excellent CG could be, provided it was married to a good story aimed at kids and adults alike. From there Pixar went from strength to strength, both at the box office and in the reviews. So, again, we must ask: why did they seek the change? We may never know exactly what happened. My understanding is that Brad Bird approached Pixar with the story and they offered him the directing stint by way of reflecting how impressed they were. This rings slightly false in that you wouldn't entrust millions of dollars to a screen writer to make a live action film and the money and directorial duties are by no means reduced for 3D animation. Therefore I think that Bird was given the gig for other reasons, most specifically that the Pixar team were worried that their tried and tested formula was becoming too obvious - mismatched buddies must retrieve something/someone precious from a perilous situation. Regardless, employ him they did and The Incredibles was the result.The Incredibles represents Pixar's best, most adult film and was both a critical and commercial hit with adults and infants alike. It contained all the action and special effects one could wish for, but kept them based around a solid, emotional core of plot, characterisation and witty story telling. Like most, if not all, Pixar films, The Incredibles was designed by adults for adults who were looking to entertain children, rather than by adults looking to exploit children (Disney should take note here and, given that they've recently acquired Pixar, it looks like they've done exactly that). This meant that the film was just as interesting to parents (and uncles) as it was to children, doubling the audience size and making the later, night showings at cinemas just as popular as the daytime ones. In foreign countries, France for example, many of the adults actually ignored the dubbed, local language versions in favour of the original English, for fear of missing some of the brilliant, adult orientated jokes (Bomb Voyage can't possibly have been as amusing in French as he was in English for example).All this comes from Bird's screenplay and it is from there that The Incredibles bursts forth, ahead of the pack. Bird fused numerous, diverse elements to tell the story of a dysfunctional family of superheroes. Mr. Incredible, Bob Parr, is a former superhero forced into retirement, along with all other super heroes, through legal action , an idea I have long considered given how litigious modern society has become. Bob and his wife Helen, the former heroine Elastigirl, disappear to start a family in suburbia.After 15 years and three kids Bob is fast approaching a midlife crisis. Other than helping the occasional client dodge the pitfalls in the insurance company he works at the only fun he has is illegal hero work found by listening in on the police radio network with his friend Frozone, another former superhero voiced superbly by Samuel L Jackson. Bob is heading for emotional meltdown when, through an unfortunate series of events, he finds himself approached with an offer for true heroism...The first half of the film, Bob's emotional emancipation followed by his attempted breakout and its consequences, gives way to the action filled second, which I won't spoil by delving into, save to say that it incorporates more than Bob. There is brilliance a plenty, the jet fight was one of the most tense scenes I've ever experienced, while at no point do you end up seeing action purely for its own sake. Each action has a far more important reaction, not least in terms of emotional growth. Numerous issues are analysed and a very positive message of family, confidence without arrogance and just being there for other people are subtly advocated.All in all I can't recommend this movie enough, particularly as it may well be the last great Pixar film. With Disney's takeover of the company we now have the bringing together of bland, tasteless, star heavy, plot lite films such as Shrek 2, Shark Tale and the like with the genius of Pixar. We can only hope that the heart and minds of the latter win out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
An overpraised but credible pastiche,"Most Pixar films get good reviews from the critics, but they seem to be falling all over themselves for THE INCREDIBLES. I'm not sure why.First off, the film strikes me as a pastiche of the Saturday morning cartoons I grew up watching, like THE FANTASTIC FOUR and JONNY QUEST, with a little James Bond thrown in. As such, it seems designed to appeal most to 10- to 14-year-old boys, a group that may be reluctant to go to an animated movie; witness the anemic box office of TITAN A.E. or TREASURE PLANET for proof.By and large, the story is played straight. There are a few laughs scattered here and there, but the tone is nothing like the mixture of humor and pathos Pixar established for the medium with TOY STORY and Dreamworks exaggerated ad nauseam in SHREK 2.Perhaps that's what the critics find appealing. THE INCREDIBLES is certainly not like any other animated film I've seen; at times, it's easy to forget that it *is* animated. Some of that is due to the ever-growing artistry of the Pixar team, which often makes you feel like you're watching a comic book/video game come to life.But as solid as the movie is -- and except for a slow start, I was not bored -- for me, it's missing that little bit of magic to take it to the next level, where millions have found Shrek and Nemo.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Much Action, But Missing Something","Big Pixar fan here. Also a big CGI fan. I took my three kids today to the movie and left a little dazed by its pace and length.I had superhuman expectations for this movie and it came up just a bit short. The action was great. The CGI was fantastic. But after all that, it just seemed to be missing something. To me, the ""style"" of the movie wasn't terribly notable either. Unlike Nemo and even Toy Story or Bug's Life, there were few ""wow"" moments where the eye candy of the CGI spoiled the viewer. Perhaps it's because we've already been spoiled from past Pixar and Shrek level pictures. This picture takes the action to a whole new level but that aspect tended to blur too many times for my tastes.Viewers who loved the thoughtful moments of The Iron Giant may be a bit disappointed here. Some of my favorite moments of The Incredibles were the small, clever instances rather than the manic action. I laughed out loud at some of these instances and wanted more. The Samuel L. Jackson character seemed underdeveloped. Even the main characters seemed thin to me. Yeah, we learned about Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl's early career fame, but nothing prior.I think this movie will stand out in the Pixar collection for the action, but it's getting easier for these CGI movies to numb the senses. There's enough here to satisfy many types of viewers, but the pace will make a second viewing necessary to get everything. Having seen The Polar Express premier the same weekend, I may have been jaded. TPE is heads and shoulders above TI in my opinion, but the former's story was already a classic. The quality of its CGI was jaw dropping too, where as The Incredibles just seemed very good.I think we expect each new computer animated movie to set a higher standard than the previous, but they'll have to level out at some point. I think we may be near that point (i.e. Shark Tale). It's now possible with CGI to do ""anything"". But the story will continue to be most important. I noticed during several points of The Incredibles that I should be more impressed with what they were able to do on screen, but I felt it didn't matter. The story wasn't keeping my interest a well as I would have liked.Pixar has set a high standard and this movie will make them financially happy, but I don't think it's Oscar-worthy. They're mortal and may not please all of us all of the time. But it's hard to not expect instant classics from them, which may be our fault more than theirs.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Good but not THAT good,"The Incredibles, (another) Pixar film, big budget, big names, big special effects etc. This film is fun for all the family, enjoying the mix of childish and adult humour that Pixar do so well. However, due to the hype surrounding this film, and the obsessions which seem to go with it, I feel compelled to inject some reason - The Incredibles is good but not THAT good. It has reasonable scripting, a predictable storyline, does not really take computer animation to new limits, and, while funny does not compare with the likes of Shrek, Toy Story, Monsters Inc or Finding Nemo (let alone a host of other superior animated films commercially unrecognised). This film is one more Pixar film to add to a growing list of adequate, fun, family films which despite being enjoyable really do add little to ""film"" as a whole. I would recommend this film to all who want a bit of an escape and do not feel like watching anything intellectually or emotionally stimulating.In summary, fun for all the family but should NEVER be considered a true great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

"A Rich, Meaningful, Funny, And Visually Arresting Family Film","This refreshing cartoon is so much fun! And it's honest fun, built on character and story without relying, for a change, on pooh-pooh humor or juvenile idiocy.

gorgeous animated tale,"The animated hit ""The Incredibles"" is a parody of superhero and James Bond movies sprinkled with cynical helpings of ""Leave it to Beaver"" and ""Father Knows Best."" This seems an odd sort of hybrid until one realizes that The Incredibles are really a crime-busting family made up of a dad named Bob (actually Mr. Incredible), a mom named Helen (aka Elastigirl), a daughter named Violet, and a son named Dash, each of whom comes equipped with his or her own superhero specialty.As the movie opens, we see the family in full fighting regalia, battling criminals, rescuing the innocent, and earning accolades from the city's grateful citizenry. However, even a superhero isn't immune from the excesses of an overly-litigious society, and soon more and more of these superhero crime fighters begin to fall victim to law suits and out-of-court settlements. As a result, not only the Incredibles, but all the known superheroes are forced to withdraw from society, being sent to faraway corners to live out their lives in a sort of witness-protection-program-type anonymity. Safely ensconced in their suburban sanctuary, Helen wants the family to adopt a ""normal"" lifestyle, hidden away from the prying eyes of a judgmental society, but Bob is a superhero to the core and he cannot endure the stifling existence imposed on him by suburban domesticity. Thus, he spends most of his time sneaking around behind his wife's back, saving the world on his off-hours. When Paul finds himself in a spot from which even the great Mr. Incredible is not able to extricate himself, it's Helen and the kiddies to the rescue and the adventure really begins.Although the humor in ""The Incredibles"" isn't as free-ranging and eclectic as it is in, say, the ""Toy Story"" or ""Shrek"" movies, the film still manages to generate a goodly number of laughs, primarily through the clever domestication of its superhero figures. Amidst all their battles with evil forces, the family still finds time for marital squabbles and sibling rivalry. But, rest assured, the time-honored themes of family unity and being true to oneself get plenty of play as well.There's first rate voice-over work from Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter and Wallace Shawn et. al. But there's none better than Brad Bird (who also wrote and directed the film) as Edna 'E' Mode, a hilarious takeoff on elitist fashion designers who makes an indelible mark in the few scenes she's in. The film does suffer a bit from over length and the problem most action-oriented films have of loading on the special effects in the action scenes to the point where the characters and storyline tend to get lost in the shuffle. But that deficiency is more than made up for in the beautifully streamlined, high-tech look of the film which seems both state-of-the-art modern and a little bit retro at one and the same time.""The Incredibles"" is a little less ingenious than the ""Shrek"" movies, but it has a beauty and charm all its own.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Very disappointing,"I don't know what movie the other comments refer to, but it was not The Incredibles.To start with, the Internet short that has been around for a long time seemed to indicated that this was a comedy. Well, the Internet sequences WERE NOT EVEN INCLUDED IN THE MOVIE. So those who laughed over the making the belt fitting scene will be sorely disappointed not to see it.This movie is NOT a comedy. It is black on a number of fronts and is not good for a younger audience. Try an incredibly violent Spy Kids.The violence is on many fronts. There is a missile downing of an aeroplane with children on board. There are several violent deaths e.g. enemies flying into cliffs. This is culturally wrong because super heroes do not kill people. Secondly, billing this movie as an animation implies a level of non-violence.There is a marital dispute that runs sourly throughout the entire movie. This is never even resolved by the end of the movie. I went to be entertained, not reminded of the difficulties of balancing my marriage.Holly Hunter was a bad choice for the mother.There was appalling grammar throughout the movie, further advancing the entertainment industries intention to ruin the English language.From a technical perspective there were a number of advances in wet scenes, water in general and lighting. However, Pixar concentrated a lot on human faces and the lip synching was noticeably bad and was a distraction throughout the movie.I am not sure where Pixar is going now, but this is not a good direction. We went to a afternoon performance with a younger audience and the only laughter was at the end.Boring, violent, and very disappointing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredibly Fun,"Overall, clever, funny, very well animated, and a lotta fun.I saw this movie as the first public premiere followed by a Q&A session with the director. First of all, I was very impressed with the CG work ... especially the fine details of the characters' hair strands. The depth of the characters' personalities was also quite appealing, superheroes with real life issues. The story was pretty clever and not very cliché-laden with the usual superhero works (even though it might remind you of a coupla movies). There's also some humor that'll fly over the kiddies' heads which surprised me a little.You're probably wondering how it compares to other Pixar films ... well, I really do feel that each film they produce just keeps getting better but each one stands on its own.

The Incredibles,"In a world where superheroes and villains are common, life is good for two heroes named Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl who like their jobs of saving people and finally marry each other. Due to an unfortunate lawsuit against Mr. Incredible, the use of all superpowers is banned and the heroes are forced to lead ordinary, normal lives. The dull suburb life is hard especially for Mr. Incredible (civilian name Bob Parr) and his lively son Dash, while his shy daughter Violet would prefer to be a normal girl despite her skills. When Bob is offered a top secret chance to resume his heroic antics, he agrees enthusiastically, much to the chagrin of his wife Helen. Things are not what they look like though and soon the whole world is in grave danger, prompting Helen to get back to business too.Pixar Studios' strengths are in good use in the movie: the conventions of James Bond-style action movies are lampooned amusingly, particularly the colourful character designs of the superhero subgenre – actually the whole plot premise sounds similar to the Watchmen graphic novel that was made into a movie in 2009. There are also some enjoyable mature jokes, such as the legal battle over saving someone's life against their will and the urban anxiety caused by an uneventful office career. The training montage and the cape mishap collection are funny too, but mostly the comedy is very action oriented. This is also where the film's biggest problems lie, as the last act of the story is almost nothing but an endless action sequence. Perhaps kids are entertained by hordes of supervillain henchmen being beaten by the family or a giant robot destroying a city, but I was getting a bit bored by the hectic, noisy mayhem that leaves little time to examine the characters' personalities. I understand the movie is not supposed to be a deep character study, but I really feel the pacing gets stuck on full speed for too long at the end.I saw a dubbed version of the film, so I cannot comment on the original voice actors' performances, but if they are as enthusiastic as the Finnish actors, the constant yelling also adds to the numb feeling caused by the excessive action (which is also surprisingly violent for a family film, even if cartoonish). At the end of the day, I don't think The Incredibles reaches the quality of the best Pixar productions that I've seen (Toy Story 1 and 2, WALLE), but it is a decent piece of entertainment in any case. I enjoyed the first half more than the second, but I'm sure many people disagree with me, so give it a go if you have enjoyed Pixar's works so far. Any superhero fan should also get a kick out of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

BUUUTT only because I was so excited to see the movie that I was open to everything.. then when I saw it for the 2nd time I just left the place.PIXAR HAS DONNEE WAY BETTER FILMS!!!!! Don't see it seriously it is a waste of time!!!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Slick Flick  The Incredibles,"(Karthik Narayan) When I saw this movie rated quite high on the movie websites, I wondered why an animated picture could be given high preference as an all-time great movie. That inquisitiveness made me watch this movie more than anything else. But after watching it, I staunchly recommend it to everyone who likes classic comedy, super hero clashes and a down to earth storyline that anyone can associate themselves with.Action super hero movies have come in aplenty, mostly taken over from comics. This movie isn't the proverbial average Super-hero (oh boy, what an oxymoron). A superhero family who try to live a common man's life and suffer the consequences and the pang of not being able to save the world in time. Instead they are at home reading the newspapers, listening to the radio which alerts the world against danger which is bound to happen anyway.The family of Mr.Incredible is secluded away from the rest of the action simply because the Government wanted them to stay away from daily life; The Government poking its nose into the common man's world, so what's new about that, you might ask. Mr.Incredible isn't able to judge what is right  to save the city against the dangers or to save his family against the dangers of the city (read people). The moral of the story is trouble is always by the people and for the people. For without people, there is no trouble.In their quest to save themselves against the world, the Superheroes succumb to the temptation to save the world against the real lurking dangers that were carelessly ignored. This causes them to throw all caution to the wind and take on the dangers that were more impeding and important. Along the way, the family unites as a team and the children learn a valuable lesson in confidence and self defense mechanisms to take on the world.The villainous fan is outrageous, the practicality of a superhero living a human life is well said and the Super powers are quite staggering  especially that of the children.The theme is superb; the comic way in which the story is woven is marvelous and overall, incredible indeed! This movie is honey spread on a plate waiting to be tasted. Don't forget to take the toasted bread with you as you move on to relish it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The Coolest Movie Ever.,"This movie was exceptionally well done, and really makes me want to see Brad Bird's other film, The Iron Giant. The plot was well crafted and clever, and the entire theater was cracking up the entire time. The props has a retro flare, and the character development was really well done. All of the credits were at the end of the movie, and they held the entire crowd. The above-the-line credits were mostly shown over the pre-vis blocking, which was a really neat effect. The below-the-line credits were slowly scrolling vertical credits with a twist. Each block of credits was on a different plane and appeared next to a colorful design. This movie is anything but disappointing, and well done til the very end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
An excellent action-comedy film.,"Strong point: Excellent Action, surprisingly deep characters, hilarious comedyWeak Point: How in the name of all that is purple did this get a PG rating?This should be an action-comedy superhero film, not a family film. The producers should have gone the whole way and made this an action film. As it is, the film is stellar. When I finished watching it, I immediately felt invigorated and exhilarated. For the first half of the movie I could not stop laughing. For the second half, I was constantly on the edge of my seat.Its hard to decide which is more appealing, the characters, the comedy, or the action. Each of these is beautifully done, and excellently presented. The special effects and action are as thrilling as a trip with Peter Jackson. The characters emotionally deep and complex. For Director Brad Bird, this is familiar territory, and something he did very well in the Iron Giant. It defiantly carries over into this masterpiece. the film is also peppered with some of the best comedy you will ever see in a film.Bottom Line: What I've meant to say with all this yakking is: Watch this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Alas, the only word that comes to mind is ""incredible""","Wow! The cinematography, the camera angles, the action shots, the direction!!!!! This movie is ""incredible"". On top of that - its got a great story line and plot! It's even got good character development! And this is a kid's movie involving super heroes! Usually a setup for cookie cutter cardboard cut outs! I think Walt Disney would be proud of this movie. The digital technology in this not only rivaled the animation of his classics - but outdid it in some ways! Action, adventure? Try James Bond in 'Thunderball"" and Indiana Jones meets Superman! Kids will love this and so will grown ups, the true mark of an outstanding animated feature.Yes, it is a little more violent than Disney's classics. Unfortunetely, that age of innocence is gone forever. By today's standards, where car jackings don't make the news because they're so routine, this movie isn't bad. I would say 9 years old. On the other hand, I used to watch a kid's cartoon called ""Space Ghost"" whose sole attraction was that he blew up half the universe every Saturday morning.......and I was 7......So, on that score I guess parents will have to make their own call. That aside, there are no weak points in this movie: voice casting, script, cinematography, action, plot, set direction, everything is great. A really fun movie to watch. And, about as entertaining and wholesome a family movie as these things get, today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Credible in Increments but not Incredible,"""The Incredibles"" is not based on how the Bush-Cheney ticket won reelection. That film is called ""Fun with Dick & George"". ""The Incredibles"" is the latest computer animated pix (as in ""Pixar"") flick. I do not want to sound like I have ""Buddy Pine Syndrome"" and be ruthless, but I must admit that to me ""The Incredibles"" was not all that incredible as many critics & filmgoers thought it to be. I actually enjoyed more the old TV show ""That's Incredible"" than ""The Incredibles"". OK, so maybe that was an incredulous incredible statement. I did not mean to go that far. Don't get me wrong! I did think that Brad Bird's film did soar at times with its elucidating look at a superhero family trying to live a suburban lifestyle before they are forced to be ""superheroexpialadoso"" (oops! wrong movie) again. All in all, ""The Incredibles"" was credible but it was not incredible. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Great family entertainment,"I must say that I took the kids to see this because they nagged me about it. I didn't have any expectations or know much about it at all, as I generally ignore the hype surrounding films. But, wow, what a great movie. The plot is the standard good versus evil, with good prevailing. However, the storyline allowed great characters to develop, the animation was top notch, and the lines were very, very funny. The fact is that the movie was able to successfully appeal to young and old. That is the magic of it. BTW, I think the designer woman character was a spin off of the wedding planner in ""Father of the Bride"", with the accent, and the manner. Still, very funny.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
What a pleasant surprise!,"Pixar has quite a good record when it comes to producing quality animated features. From it's pioneering 'Toy Story' to the fabulous 'Monsters Inc.' and the very funny 'Finding Nemo'. Now comes The Incredibles. This film explores the life of superheroes that all of a sudden are forced into a premature retirement, much to their dismay. However soon they are forced back into an action to counter an unlikely enemy.Well because Pixar's last two efforts were comedies and based on the trailer of this one I was expecting this to also be a comedy. To my surprise their were only a few funny moments in the film. So guys don't expect to be laughing all through the movie. It was a little annoying at first but eventually I got used to it and was able to appreciate the movie more.As expected the production team did a great job in creating beautiful characters and a realistic world around them. Even up to now I still can't help but admire computer made animation. I guess it has something to do with growing up and getting used to seeing animation done by hand and this one seems so different and unique to what I am used to.My impression on the cast initially was not that positive. Seeing how past films would pack their rosters with A List actors to do the voicing, this one really didn't live up to that 'standard'. Plus the fact that I felt that Craig T. Nelson didn't really fit the role (as I had expected this to be a pure comedy). After the film I'm still not that convinced with Nelson but I thought Holly Hunter did a great job. You go just feel that Elasti-Girl's character fits Hunter's personality to a T.I really cannot comment much on the plot line. Normally I wouldn't like this type of story which seemed a little predictable but this is after all a movie intended for the younger set and perhaps this can be excused.In the final reckoning, it may not be as good as perhaps Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo but it was still a credible effort. Overall quite a solid movie which many will enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Incredible!!!!,"Wonderful movie. For a moment, I forgot that I am watching a comic. Emotions looked real. Characters just fitted very well. Story is really good and animation is world class. No noise, no deviations and narration was straight to the point. Everyone in the superhero's family is given a unique power and they are given a pie of their share fighting with the baddies. All characters are balanced really well which most of the superhero movies miss. suspense about the villain really stands out. I enjoyed watching this movie. I am curious about the second part of this movie. I haven't found anything to complain. This movie deserves a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Modern Design style of this well made film,"I would like to correct ""the unemployed critic"" with his small mistake calling the film's design as ""Art Deco"". Art Deco was a design movement of the Twenties to the early Forties, more or less.What makes this movie so much fun are the references to MODERN architecture and design of the Fifties and Sixties. Take a look at the Parr's house and you'll see influences by Richard Neutra, Pierre Koenig and the Case Study House project in California of the 1940's to 1960's. The flagstone walls, open rooms, kitchen miter windows and gorgeous interior design make it a thrill to explore. This movie has so many details you'll see new things with every viewing. Such refreshing and creative visuals.There are many references to the modern era in general. What a forward thinking time with excitingly new architecture and design. Something that seems to lack in our present day society.As a passing interest, Edna Mode is modeled after Hollywood costume maker par excellence Edith Head. How fitting that she be the costume designer for the Incredibles!Pick up the book ""The Art of the Incredibles"" to get the whole story of the meticulous design process that went in the well made film. It's well worth it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Perfect!,"Hello this is the first time that I comment a movie in here, and I'm glad this film had that ""privilege"".I just saw The Incredibles last night for the fifth time, and it thrilled me like the first time.It's amazing the quality of this film, Brad Bird created a masterpiece here,with reminiscences of many great trademarks like James Bond (the most obvious), but also of Indiana Jones, Star Wars, X Men, The Simpsons, and of course the golden age of comics.Visally stunning, the script doesn't' get better than this, the character development is extraordinary (notice how Violet and Dash have similar conversations than their parents, he he) God, this movie is just perfect.I consider myself pretty demanding when i rate films, and this is one of my few 10s.And what to say about Mr, Michael Giachinno, the next ""Maestro"" of film music, this guy's amazing.Brad Bird is one of the best directors in the industry, such a shame that animated films still are underrated, the job he did here (and in Ratatouille) was worth an Academy Award nod, let's see if he gets it with his next project, a ""live action]"" film.Mr. Brad Bird and Mt.

Pixar's greatest movie.,"4/4The Incredibles feels as if it goes out of it's way to go against every superhero movie stereotype in the books. It's a completely original world with great characters, dialogue, and animated action. It stands out against so many other family films because it is one of the few that actually appeals to the whole family. It won't leave little kids bored half-way through, but it's smart enough to keep the teens and adults satisfied.The movie centers around the Parr family. The common love or dismissal of superheroes is replaced with a society that hates their guts. After an attempted suicide was foiled by Mr. Incredible, superheroes were outlawed. Then it cuts to him as a family man. His kids and wife (former super ""Elasta-Girl) have superpowers, and after 15 years of leading a ""normal life"", he has a compulsive need to sneak out at night to preform heroics.Instead of studying only one superhero, it gives adequate screen time and attention to each member of the Parr family. Each member of the family has their own powers and balances each other out in the action. The chemistry between the characters alternates between trying to preform heroics, and well... typical family squabbling. The way The Incredibles depicts the ultimate family super-team side as well as the typical American family side is very clever.Pixar made a movie that will shake the foundations of its rival studios. Their keaner eye for quality and tried-and-true conflict style has carried them for more than 20 years. They have had their downs, and they have had their greats, but The Incredibles is one for the ages.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Slower than I expected,I never got around to watching this when it came out but had heard great things about it so had high expectations going into it 17 years later. I don't know if it's just because animated movies have gotten more ambitious in the intervening years but it just wasn't as good as I expected. It felt a little slow to get going and the story was pretty predictable and straightforward after the first 10 mins. It also wasn't much of a spectacle and although it was it was an enjoyable film in a laid back Sunday afternoon kind of way it wasn't special.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Greatest Animated Movie Ever,"This is without a doubt the best animated movie I have ever seen and has the distinction of being the only animated film in my top 25 movies of all time. The reason I like this movie because unlike other animated films of this current generation, it isn't preachy, there is no symbolism like in ""Finding Nemo"" where Nemo's underdeveloped fin makes the entire film about overcoming his handicap and proving to his father that he is just like everyone else. Kids and adults alike watch these types of movies as an escape. They want to have a good time without being bombarded with ""life lessons"". The Incredibles is exactly that, a good time. It's not a movie directed strictly at kids either. Adults can enjoy this just as much as any child. The animation is great, the story is amazing and the action is non stop. If you only see one animated movie in your lifetime, this is the one. I hope they make a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Very good but not Pixar's best.,"While never achieving the hight of some of their later works like Ratatouille and Wall-E this is nonetheless still a very entertaining film. Expect the same masterful Pixar animation, rendering, and character design. Plot wise this is a twist on your basic comic book super hero. In this case we have a family of super heroes living in a world that no longer appreciates them. Think super heroes meet mid life crisis and you have the basic idea. Much of the film obviously borrows heavily from the James Bond genre from the music to the over the top villain and his evil super villain lair. One half expects to see Dr. Evil pop up somewhere. The writers have done a good job crafting a believable and charming family that you will actually care for, good dialogue goes a long ways here. They have also done a good job of finding creative and comical ways of using each characters super powers both individually and in tandem as a family super hero team.My only complains with the film is that after watching the greatness of Ratatouille and Wall-E The Incredibles just sort of feels like Pixar was turning the crank with this one. It's still a very enjoyable film and heads and tails above most other animated works but it's not Pixar's best. It's a little too formulaic for that and the characters while charming never quite grab you they way some of Pixar's best creations do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Up, Up and Away.","The Incredibles (2004)Disney  Theatre  D: Brad Bird  3/4Truth be known there is only one reason I went to see the new Pixar flick and that is simply the Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith trailer. Well the trailer hit all the cords it should have and hopefully Lucas may just not be washed up as a filmmaker. But May 19th is still a ways off; I better secure my tome off now. Anywho back to the feature, Incredibles is a clever take on the superhero tale. Mr. Incredible is your typical superpowered do-good-er that is until an overzealous fan helps to bring him down and all the heroes must stop using their powers and get day jobs. The film looks awesome as the Pixar films always do. But as we know graphics and effects only go so far. The clever plot hits a snag every now and then but nothing major. A lot of action with an occasional slowdown, The Incredibles will be a hit with the kids and adults alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Flashy, but pretty ho-hum","When one walks into a Pixar film, one can usually expect the sort of quirky animated cleverness that the studio has become known for in such imaginative fare like ""Toy Story 2,"" ""A Bug's Life,"" and ""Finding Nemo."" In those films, Pixar re-imagines and reconfigures the established. Sharks undergoing therapy for cannibalism, or an ant committing suicide by walking into a drop of water, are creative re-workings of what we see and dismiss everyday. It takes creative minds to come up with such amusing alternatives to what would normally not elicit a second glance from all of us, and most importantly, it is possible and most plausible only in the world of animation where talking fishes and bugs do not seem totally ridiculous.Such imagination is absent with their newest feature, ""The Incredibles."" This movie's creative insight is that, well, superheroes really CAN have mundane lives. The film is visually gorgeous but thematically empty, a merely average film that has been raised to celestial levels for what many have labeled its animated ""realism,"" I'm guessing what most critics apocryphally mean when they notice shimmering wet hair or fluid body movements. Well, mimicking humans is not trailblazing Pixar's territory, but belongs first to the Squaresoft Pictures flop, ""Final Fantasy: Spirits Within."" The second one is a terrible film as most over-inflated, sci-fi anime can be, but ""The Incredibles"" has escaped such criticism largely due to critics falling in love with its pastel color scheme and its fidelity to cartoonish humans with real features (like said hair) amidst an environ of real water, fire, trees, etc. If making everything appear so ""real"" was the goal, why not just shoot a live-action film with CGI superimposed and save us all the time, money, and lavish plaudits?The fact is were it not for the CGI, this film's reportedly high-minded drama would not garner any year-end awards. As some other reviewers have pointed out, it's as cliché-ridden as can be, even falling upon the sitcom-like contrived plots such as a series of coincidences making a wife believe her husband is cheating on her, or the nerdy girl not fitting in with the cool crop at school, only to fit in and receive invitations from the future prom king at the end (the creators could have taken a lesson from this year's anti-conformity ""Napoleon Dynamite""). Most Pixar plots have been fairly simple with good messages, but what livens up nearly every story they have told are new takes on the humdrum. Turtles turned into stoner surfers in ""Finding Nemo,"" for example, while ""A Bug's Life"" is teeming with new versions of a collection of insects. The Incredible family's superpowers are supposed to substitute for this lack of creative imagination, but the abilities are not inventive themselves. Super strength, flexibility, speed, invisibility are all brilliantly conceived, but as wonders lack variety to the eye, and since the Incredibles' world is modeled on the human world, there is also no escape into the beautiful rendering of the ocean or of a blown-up microcosm like in other Pixar features. As hard as it may seem to imagine, this movie more than any other Pixar film could have been filmed in live-action, a cardinal no-no suggestion for any animated flick.The decision to make the film a drama devoid of humor is also not a wise one; scenes that would normally be infused by amusing side-characters are filled with sidekicks there only to advance the plot. Edna as a creation, for instance, is mildly amusing but is a simple caricature of Bond movies and fashion designers, supplying useful gadgets but lacking the imagination of a true creation (and not parody) of a Mr. Potato Head or Heimlich caterpillar. Jokes are not as edgy and wry as a result, and while its insistence on a conservative moral might be fresh in today's left-Hollywood climate (i.e. Manchurian Candidate, Spartan), its beaten to the ground ad-nauseum by every character who gets a turn at dictating it to the audience.""The Incredibles"" is not a terrible movie. Though uninspired, it's still technically marvelous animation. The story is initially amusing in points. The kitchen-sink drama is actually brutally honest, depicting family life (albeit superhero family life) at its most stultifying and completely routine, something very far from a traditionalist conservative message. There are even some good action scenes, especially when the speedy son discovers the true extent of his own superpowers. But maybe it's all that CGI, or a lack of original story, that made me consider ""The Incredibles"" more of a video game by its end rather than a feature film. The final boss battle could be straight from a platformer or role-playing game with one party of five unleashing attacks on one mechanical robot replete with attack points and weaknesses. By the final accounts, ""The Incredibles"" is really a very average movie, but has the potential to be an excellent video game. Take it from someone who plays them.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Five out of Five - 5/5,"Of the several Pixar films that I have seen and remembered, ""The Incredibles"" is probably the most sophisticated, not to mention that it has great storytelling, and satisfying entertainment value. Brad Bird (director/writer) and John Welker (producer) came up with lots of ideas for the entire script to keep families stimulated. One of the main themes of this film is having fond memories of the good old days, which really spoke out to me as a person. Also, there is something that sets this film apart from all of the other superhero movies from Marvel and DC: The superpowers that our heroes possess are their talents. Also, being proud at working alone can sometimes lead to potentially dangerous consequences. Our heroes in the Parr family are not just an ordinary superhero ensemble, they are a family working together by using their own talents. The plotline is a lot less straightforward compared to ""Finding Nemo."" Throughout the story, ""The Incredibles"" delivers inspiring messages about teamwork and showing one's talents for the greater good.Brad Bird's direction is first rate in all corners; he provided superbly-staged set pieces in spades. The sharp, witty humor succeeds due to the cadence that delivers an effective sense of timing, and it was resonated by the well-utilized tone, and slick visual gags. Speaking of tone, the tone is mature, bold, and dark, yet so sincere. As an action movie, it truly is an action-packed extravaganza of spectacular proportions with electrifying action sequences that are smartly-written, and has a lot of sprightly momentum, explosions, and destruction. Visually and aurally, the suspenseful elements are gripping, while the emotional elements feel tender and genuine. The intelligent dialogue is some of the best I have ever heard; the dialogue is full of surprises, making the characters quick-witted, offering interesting exposition, and some of the lines are thought-provoking with complexity. The music score by Michael Giacchino is a big orchestral/big band jazz hybrid that delivers dramatic excitement via rich compositions and rousing energy, as it offers a snazzy fusion of grand heroism, mesmerizing mystery, and threatening suspense. The sound effects are impressive, and some of them make the movie atmospheric in each environment.The animation is as sublime as ""Finding Nemo"" with photorealistic detail, dazzling colors, classy energy, different places that look creative and provides an immersive atmosphere. The animation has a slick sense of timing, and the character designs are charming. The impeccable voice cast makes their characters feel tangible. They also deliver the appropriate energy for the drama and humor. Craig T. Nelson is phenomenal as Bob/Mr. Incredible; he sounds grounded, manly, and tired with a touch of grief to it. Holly Hunter makes Helen/Elastigirl with realistic maternalism via sweet tenderness and serious authority. Sarah Vowell makes Violet sound like any moody teenager. Spencer Fox makes Dash an amusing, enthusiastic boy who loves nothing but speed. Jason Lee's voice makes Syndrome sound like an excitable and sadistic jerk with grim darkness to his voice. As a character, he is a complex antagonist with a sympathetic backstory and a thought-provoking goal.In conclusion: ""The Incredibles"" possesses high intelligence, an involving personality that is both grounded and fun, and a great story that contains universal messages that everyone will appreciate. Highly Recommended for the entire family (suitable for kids seven and up).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The Incredibles is Incredible On All Levels.,"After exploring the world of toys, bugs, monsters & ocean life in an extremely unusual yet intimately human manner, Pixar Animation Studios brings its sweeping cinematic vision to the world of superheroes, this time showing the highs n lows of life from their point of view. And just like their previous ventures, The Incredibles continues Pixar's dream run of all-round success & is one of the greatest films about superheroes.The Incredibles tells the story of a family of superheroes, with each member having unique set of superpowers. Forced into retirement to a civilian life due to the number of lawsuits resulting from the damages caused by their crime-fighting activities, Mr. Incredible's wish to relive the glory days is granted when he's asked for assistance on a secret mission but it ultimately thrusts his entire family into action to save the world from an imminent threat.Written & directed by Brad Bird, The Incredibles is his sophomore effort after The Iron Giant & also marks his first stint at Pixar. And while the script is superbly written plus wonderfully balances its moments of action, drama, comedy, adventure & spectacle, it's the computer animation here that breaks all barriers of its time to realise Bird's vision on the film canvas in a full-fledged manner, which also makes it Pixar's most challenging work until that point.Coming to the technical aspects, The Incredibles leaves its mark in all departments. The 3D rendering of every frame is polished to an extensive level of detail. Cinematography makes energetic use of camera, firm exhibition of colour palette plus also benefits from accurate lighting. Editing is at its absolute best during the action sequences, most of which are jaw- dropping to look at, but there are also a few moments where the pacing is a bit on a slower side.Add to that, characters inhabiting the picture are brilliantly envisioned, sketched & rendered plus the relentless refinement in screenplay nicely takes care of the character development part. Pixar again puts up a rich voice cast, all of whom ably fill in their respective roles. The themes of mid-life crisis, job dissatisfaction, marriage troubles etc are elegantly handled as well. And Michael Giacchino chips in with a fantastic score that beautifully intertwines with the events of this action-adventure.On an overall scale, The Incredibles is Pixar's most action-packed film to date that sets a new benchmark for computer animation by stretching it beyond its limitations. Full of creative energy, highly gripping plot, intriguing characters, spellbinding action, groundbreaking animation, vibrant photography, tight editing & sensational score, all pushed to extreme under Brad Bird's kinetic direction, this instant classic triumphs as one of the most enjoyable, entertaining & satisfying films to come out of Pixar's cannon. Living up to its name & working on all levels, The Incredibles is blockbuster filmmaking at its most incredible.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
'Incredibles' Wasn't What I Expected,"The Incredibles:Toy Story, Monster's Inc, and Finding Nemo all had one thing in common, they were great family films! They were funny without being crude, and once in a while had some comical violence. The Incredibles was nothing like its predecessors! I was surprised at how much non-comical violence it had! Many bad guys met explosive ends. It is somewhat expected though because it was PG and it was directed by Brad Bird (director of the Simpsons, and Iron Giant). It nevertheless wasn't very funny like the other Pixar films, and it just didn't have the feel of a Pixar film, it was more of a mix between Spy Kids, and X-Men.Bob Parr (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) was known to all as Mr. Incredible, but now the he has retired to a quiet life in the suburbs and a job as an insurance salesman. But after a mysterious person summons him to a remote island, he springs back into action, along with his superpower-endowed family; Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), Dash, and Violet Parr. Then the plot thickens (maybe too much for a kids movie) when a crazy little scientist tries to take over as the Ultimate Superhero.The movie is actually pretty good if you think of it more as an action film, then a comedy/kids movie. The effects once again have gotten even more realistic, every explosion actually looks real! The characters are also really funny at points! Especially Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), and a little man by the name of Gilbert Huph (Mr. Incredibles boss). There were parts where I laughed out loud, but they were few. One other upside is the previews before the movie! There is one incredibly awesome looking Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith trailer, due out in May of next year! Be sure to see that!All in all: 7 out of 10Rated PG for action violence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
An Ordinary Family,"Bob and Helen live a quiet life in the suburbs with their children. An ordinary family, by all accounts. But in fact, they're all superheroes with superhuman powers. And soon those powers will be in very high demand.Director Brad Bird presented this idea to Pixar Studios in the early 2000s. He had already done ""The Iron Giant"" for Warner Bros, but since that movie was a big disappointment at the box office, Bird wanted to try something else.And thankfully, the gamble paid off. Brad Bird brought his proven team to Pixar where a completely new technology was developed to animate their all-human cast.

8.6 ??  This movie was LAME.,"Right about now I'm thinking that there must be something wrong with *me.* After all, the world is saying that this is an 8.6 movie, and people are giving it 10s. And I thought it SUCKED.The pacing is horrible. The first hour is positively boring, unfunny, and the action scenes are so fast that you can hardly tell what's going on. There were a few great moments, but not enough to make me really care about any of the characters. I was actually going to *walk out* because it was simply dull. But then every once in a while, something interesting would happen and I'd want to keep giving it a chance.OK, so in the last 20 minutes or so, the story actually picks up. And by that I mean you can *follow* what's happening, because the pacing is better and not all crazy and frenetic. For a while the characters slow down and reflect on what's happening to them, and they seem to be real people. There's also some good (creative) action toward the end, and the villain's plot is the only truly well-crafted part of the story.It's annoying that the humor attempts are mostly just cheap things that they throw in on the side (kid on big wheel) that have nothing to do with the story, or repetitive sight gags like Mr. Incredible accidentally breaking some household object because he doesn't know his own strength. Meanwhile, there are HUGE tracts of dialogue that are absent of cleverness, or just too fast, mumbled, or obscured by FX sounds.I did not care for the design of this movie generally - often the characters' eyes were dark and flat. They did not have that shine in them, the living sparkle that would draw me in. While I sat there I thought about other animated films where the eyes seemed positively beaming with emotions, and here everyone seemed like a wind-up toy. Maybe I am just too ""old-school"" animation, but it seems like there is so much focus now on light and shading and detail of the surrounding scenes that the distinction and liveliness of the characters has been lost.I loved The Lion King and the Toy Story movies as much as anyone else. I saw Shrek 2 three times. I also disliked Home on the Range, Treasure Planet and Atlantis for the same reasons the critics did.But for some reason this movie just did NOT deliver for me. Bland script, uneven action, minimally sympathetic characters... Not to mention some rather annoying, obligatory add-in scenes like the goth daughter who is suddenly more popular at school and the cute guy asks her out, and Samuel Jackson's character who is totally undeveloped.I also found it really weird that the villain did not have *ONE, single* humorous or clever line.So apparently I'm in some 1% that disliked this movie. But be warned, people:I was once like you.One day you're going along enjoying all these movies, and then suddenly they all suck but no one agrees with you.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Meet the Supers!,"What's so admirable about Pixar Animation Studios is how they pay attention to the most important factor, story and the art of storytelling. The Incredibles continues the studios' long line of films that excel not only in animation, but in quality as well. Filling the screen with highly detailed and stylized images, the story introduces us to a family of superheroes. After they are forced to go undercover and live a normal suburban life, they must join and work together in order to defeat the maniacal Syndrome. The movie has a great plot that not only explores many common family issues but has lots of action and adventure that will please the young and old alike. The characters are a blast to watch because they are so well-drawn and full of life. Aside from our family of superheroes, there's fashion diva Edna Mode, ""oh-so-cool"" Frozone, and obnoxious boss Gilbert Huph (perfectly voiced by Wallace Shawn). Even the smallest of characters stand out (such as Bomb Voyage). Pixar made a great investment in hiring Brad Bird. He's a very talented man who has created a popcorn masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Nothing short of Incredible,"""The Incredibles"" is a clever play on the classic Super-Hero story that excels in appealling to the entire family. While the colorful animations and action-packed sequences will capture the eye of younger viewers, the multilayered storytelling and down-to-earth portrayal of the characters will easily welcome a mature audience as well. In a film that could have simply leaned toward established tropes or a base interpretation of the Hero's Journey for it's content, Pixar instead crafted a memorable and unique spin on the genre that still impresses to this day.Concerning the plot, the movie leans more toward a spy-thriller aesthetic than a traditional action-focused approach. The narrative follows Robert ""Bob"" Parr as the dynamic Mr. Incredible, a renowned ""Super"" forced to adapt to a more normalized life alongside his wife Helen and their kids after an act of heroism forced all ""Super's"" into giving up their roles by mandate of the government. Endeavoring to balance his yearning for the glory days with the genuine love he has for his family, Bob's impulses for justice eventually cost him his job and force him into leading a double life; ultimately landing him in the clutches of the vengeful mastermind, Syndrome, as the rest of his family sets out to find him. Aside from several contrivances in the final battle alongside a finale that wrapped up rather swiftly, the story's pacing is exceptional overall: especially for an animated feature totaling nearly two hours in length. There is also something to be said for the feeling of risk toward the main characters, as most enemy combatants target with the intent to kill; additionally making several of their on-screen deaths permissible.By extension, another striking feature of the film in regards to it's story is the prioritization of set-up and pay-off. Many of the early scenes and events, such as the day of Bob and Helen's marriage and the ""No Capes"" discussion Bob has with an old acquaintance, attribute to two or more foundational aspects that carry over into later material. Overall, this strengthens the movie as a whole, while lending a satisfying air of revisit value that can be difficult to achieve with more shallow and predictable writing.As for the characters, most of the key players are fleshed out to a surprisingly relatable degree which prevents them from falling into cookie-cutter stereotypes. For example, even though he is tempted, Bob is never too desperate to reclaim the mantel of ""Mr. Incredible"" that he would abandon his family. Likewise, though Helen adapts to a family life easier than her husband, she still has struggles in balancing her headstrong personality with the ability to listen to others. Though their older children, Violet and Dash, have significantly reduced arc's in the overall picture, they still overcome the hurdles set before them in a satisfying manner to earn their place in the film. Long-standing friends of the Parr's, Edna and Frozone, attributed much to the humor with their catchy dialogue. The mysterious Mirage plays an excellent femme fatale, and perhaps most iconically, there is Syndrome. Rather than touting a stereotypical world-domination approach toward his grand designs, he spearheads two juxtaposing goals that are equal parts understandable and sinister: fulfilling his childhood dream to become a Super Hero in his own eyes and dismantling the very ability of ""Super's"" by flattening the playing field via his high-end gadgets and tech. Concerning the latter of these two ambitions, much of his dialogue is on point and menacing, including his iconic quote, ""And when everyone is super, no one will be."" Though the film reveals enough of his past to promote some lingering traces of tragedy toward his motives, it also undercuts any sympathy that can be granted by showcasing the diabolical extent of his methods front and center; ultimately creating an intimidating archenemy and foil for Bob and his family.In terms of aesthetics, some points must be awarded for the memorable soundtrack that is equal parts low-key espionage and bombastic jazz. Almost twenty years later, it is still easily recognizable and attributable to this film.In conclusion, the combination of strong writing, clever humor, and smart implementation and balance of kid-friendly and mature topics make this movie an excellent experience for young and old. Though a degree of polish could have been applied to the latter half of the film in terms of avoiding contrivances, and a more fluid pacing at the climax would have ramped up the tension even further, most nitpicks and mild grievances are ultimately overshadowed by a presentation that is nothing short of incredible.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Some of the most fun I've had with a six year old ...,"Pixar has done it again! As the father of two young boys, I have the dubious honor of having seen every Pixar movie at least twice and this is certainly the best (though not by far). The CG studio has a knack for producing films that appeal to adults and kids, with stunning visuals, great story lines and outstanding casting. This is no exception. With a lineup that includes Hollywood stalwarts Samuel L. Jackson, Holly Hunter and (underrated) Craig T. Nelson, the film propels by at rocket launcher speed with just the right mix of comedy, action and pathos. Though a bit predictable in a couple spots, it has lightning pacing and a wonderful script. Brad Bird has invented a whole world, combining elements of early James Bond, the Jetsons and classic serial comic books. He even manages to work in references to latter day classics, such as Terminator 2. I can't wait till my kids buy me the DVD!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
It's a film you want to return to watch in the future - Recommended,"Let's be honest, almost all Pixar films are brilliant and The Incredibles is no exception. It's witting, brilliant and well worth watching.The good and the... bad(?), just the good then:The humour is fantastic throughout.The story keeps you grippedThe voices are well cast. In fact the story of how Brad Bird (the Director) struggled to find a voice actor for Edna ""E"" Mode before casting himself is great.It leads well into suggesting and indeed fulfilling a second movie,Incredibles 2 (2018)even though it took a good 14 YEARS LATER.The film is 16 years old at the time of writing this review and it's still a highly recommended watch, unlike many of the marvel films from around that time.Recommended for anyone looking for a relaxed, fun and light-hearted animation.

Very good but hardly great,"I am commenting on The Incredibles only because I appear to be in the minority. While I admired the witty writing, the amazing animation, and most of the voice work, I was not as impressed with The Incredibles as were most of the other reviewers.I had two main problems with this film: First, it is simply too long. There should be far more deleted scenes on the DVD. It must be heartbreaking to cut scenes into which the film makers have poured so much love and effort, both of which are evident here. Nevertheless, had it been, say, 20 minutes shorter, it would have been a better film.Second, this film does not find an effective balance between being funny and being moving. The silliness is great, but when they get into territory that ought to move us -- and they do appear to be trying to move us, the feeling is one of detachment.The other reviewers have done a wonderful job of hailing the film's many strengths.

"This gets a non-committal ""eh""","I was told by several friends to go buy this sight unseen. ""Don't bother renting it. Just buy it."" Boy, am I glad I didn't. This movie was average in the extreme.On the plus side, yes, the animation is excellent. The close up facial features and attention to detail is fantastic. Jason Lee's voice work was excellent, as well. However, the story never really took off. I wanted more time spent on the children, giving me more details about their problems so that when they came into their own later in the movie, it would mean more. I didn't get it. Worst of all there was very little humor. In the past, Pixar has been known to have a good dose of wit in their movies. This one had almost none. Had I gone in knowing this was 99% drama, I probably would have been much less disappointed.Don't get me wrong, this is still a pretty solid film.

Holds up,"Lawsuits shut down vigilantism. 15 years later, one of the heroes is called upon again. Can he achieve victory without losing the suburban life that makes his wife happy?This is not technically an actual film adaptation of The Fantastic Four, but it is easily the best of them. I mean not that the competition is particularly strong. It will be when we get an MCU version. Anyway. In addition to fun, creative use of superpowers, it's also about family dynamics. Despite all the tension that it gets out of that aspect, it doesn't feel like this was just made to vent frustration. Every major character is fully realised. They have good and bad parts. The 1960s early Bond spy aesthetic is appealing. This has some of the best and most visually compelling action I've ever seen. When something is moving incredibly fast, you can feel it.If I had to criticise something about this, I do think that it could have spent more time on the younger members, it's mostly focused on Bob, the father and husband. I do hear that they try to do that with the sequel, so I appreciate that. This is very funny and the characters are highly memorable, including their incredibly cartoony designs. This really feels like a comic book turned into a movie. There are a lot of details that it needs to communicate to the audience, and it largely accomplishes it without resorting to exposition dumps.I recommend this to any fan of graphic novels. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The Title Doesn't do it Justice,"The Incredibles is just one of the most incredible movie if you don't mind the stupid redundancy.I had good hopes for it, and after Finding Nemo, it was very hard for The Incredibles to follow a film that would ignite such expectations. But, this really was beyond me.The film is brilliant, it's a remarkable achievement, and I'm not talking about the animation or the technology, I'm talking about the extreme maturity and intelligence with which the film is narrated, as Nemo, Incredibles has above average character development, it surpasses many regular films, and within the genre, it surpasses Spider Man. Now, I'm probably going to get based, but Spider Man is no where near the brilliance of The Incredibles, it is an extremely entertaining film, with lot's of depth, in both story and character, the film is perfect, it fulfills all of it's aspirations and surpasses them.Now, some have bashed the movie on the basis that the film takes heavy cues off Fantastic Four and Spy Kids, the answer, yes the film does have strong foundations from those two, but, neither of them on their better moments amount to what Incredibles has achieved, and besides, the whole point of the movie is that works within that genre, what GREAT genre movies do is they take a overdone and weary genre, give it a fresh, innovative and clever spin and turn it into a new level(similar to what Scorsese did with GoodFellas, don't get me wrong, I'm not comparing GoodFellas with Incredibles, I'm comparing the look towards the individual genres each films takes.) The Incredibles as all Pixar films cover all demographics, Incredibles has something for everyone, and those who don't find it funny, and find it too slow, well, Pixar never set out to do Airplane funny, and making fun of other stuff like Shrek is way too easy, Incredibles has it's share of laughs. And it's not too slow, it only takes it's time to build the characters, so that when the film takes a fast pace, it's not juts for the kicks, important things are at stake, characters are important. It's stupid to bash a film because it takes it'ts time to build it's characters, which seems a forgotten art in Hollywood this days(particularly action/adventure). The film not only is concerned on being exiting, explosive and entertaining, but that it has a logical and interesting story, with clearly defined characters.To sum up, the film to my opinion raises the bar in not just animated cinema, but cinema all together.On an extra note, the film has a superb use of music, reminiscent to James Bond soundtracks, very catchy, and used with incredible skill.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The characters all have superpowers we've seen before, nothing new there. The villain was extremely annoying, I know its supposed to be a kids movie but in a superhero flick, the villain has to stand out. This has to be the most overrated movie, unless everyone who voted is less than 13 years old. I was thoroughly disappointed. Now that Pixar is ending its tenure with Disney, lets hope that they start making more contemporary movies with their animation skills.

No progress,"In my opinion this movie represents no progress in the history of modern animation movies in which computer technique replaced drawing technique. This story could be made and told with real actors instead of animated characters. In fact we don't see here any anthropomorphic animals, fairies or witches just only normal people living in a city of the present times though some of them endowed with supernatural powers whose origin is never revealed. No poetry or lyricism either just only adventure and violent fighting with the usual common special effects computers can produce even in movies performed by real players. But even these effects are not especially creative or more original than those we have seen in a lot of other recent animation movies. Do the people who made this movie think that animated characters can portray human emotions or feelings than human actors whatever the former's facial expressions and bodily movements may look human? When they are well done we like them just because they seem human and not because they are better expressed then by real actors and actresses. Of course the only advantage is that animated characters can be 100% shaped by his creator in a way that no movie director can make with human players who always have their own personalities. But this is precisely what we like to see: a human player putting in the acting something of his or her own personality and not acting like a created robot. Well for those who like this kind of movie they won't be disappointed after all since the movie has got enough action and enough thrilling scenes to make it fairly enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The Incredibles is the pinnacle of superhero animation.,"Not to mention this is my favourite Pixar animation, this is also my favourite superhero film. A genre that is ridiculously exhausted now, The Incredibles took superheroes and made them relatable, human...and damn likeable. They are just like us, with families and a desire to do good in the world. Sure they have powers that neither me, you or the pet cat have, but it was refreshing to watch the day-to-day lives of a super heroic family. The family we follow is the Parr family, in particular the focus is on Mr Incredible. Washed up, old and trying to earn a living, he desires to be the famed superhero that he once was. Where to begin with this? Outstanding animation, perfect voice casting, memorable characters, inventive plot and one of the most quotable scripts of all time. There is no way anyone can hate on this film, no way. Every character is superb, from the charming Parr family to the villainous Syndrome (who by the way, is your biggest fan...). But the champion is the one, the only...Edna Mode. Every scene with her, is comedic genius. Where her spinoff film? I would pay top dollar to see that! The script is phenomenally quotable and plagued with famous scenes. ""Where's my super suit!?"", ""No capes!!"", ""Go home buddy, I work alone."" and a personal favourite ""Coincidence? I think NOT!"". Consistently funny, witty and charming, you don't get scripts like these in every family film. The plot was engrossing with no pointless scenes, the pacing was rapid and builds up to the final battle sequence. The superpowers were creative, heck even the baby has some damn awesome superpowers. A baby!? When was the last time you saw that in a film? Oh and Samuel L Jackson was perfect voice casting for Frozone, without a doubt. In my opinion, drum roll please, Pixar haven't exceeded with an animation since The Incredibles. This being one of my favourite films of all time, this is a super duper ridiculously easy perfect rating. Where's my sequel? I need it now.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Even the better settings are a bit hard to look at at times. However, the movie makes up for this with some great editing, direction, and visual storytelling. Everything that requires good animation is animated well enough for the story to be told even if the backgrounds leave a lot to be desired.

Definietly the best Pixar movie,"Brad Bird is most definietly the best director Pixar has utilized in their entire history, at least in my opinion. Even though he's only made 3 movies so far, they all have this feeling attached to them that no other Pixar movies do. That is the feeling of maturity, Bird writes and directs his movies as if they were made for adults, and children were more of an after-thought. Nowhere is this clearer than in The Incredibles. The plotline draws you in very easily, and the pacing is extremely good. The dialogue in this movie feels very mature and sophisticated, and Bob and Helens relationsship is portrayed almost uncomfortably realistic, to the point that I didn't catch most of the subtleties as a kid. And that's the biggest strength of the movie, the characters. Each of the family members is portrayed so wonderfully realistic, their struggles feel real and their arguments don't feel obnoxious. The other characters are great as well. Frozone and Edna are both great, and Syndrome is a fantastic villain. He's pathetic and funny yet a genuine threat at the same time. The performances of course help bringing the characters to life, with basically everyone doing a great job with their voice acting. Another thing this movie does very good is the dark undertones. There are a lot of deaths and heartbreak, both to a degree you wouldn't see in a regular Pixar movie. The movie also has excellent score and sound design, and the action scenes are (for a lack of a better word) Incredible. The continuity within the film is great, the characters are fantastic and the visuals are gorgeous. This is one of my all time favorite movies, it's definietly the best Pixar movie and maybe even the best movie released by a Disney-owned company. I highly recommend this to anyone that appreciates deep, meaningful story-telling, and I have no problem giving it the highest score I can.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

A Nutshell Review: The Incredibles,"When I heard about the production, I wondered if it touched too close to Marvel's Fantastic Four, another superhero family of sorts - Mr Fantastic, with stretch powers, The Invisible Girl and Human Torch, self explanatory, and The Thing, with extraordinary strength. Even the villain at the end looked suspiciously like Fantastic Four's Moleman!And yes, though the powers are slightly different, the bickering, interaction and relationships amongst the members are retained in the storyline.Which works, wonders. Pixar has done it again, weaving strong characterization into their superhero storyline, with each family member having problems of their own, and tying it very nicely to their powers. Mr Incredible, being super strong, realizes his own vulnerability, Elastigirl using her powers to literally run and maintain the family, Violet with her powers of invisibility to hide her insecurity, and Dash, being young and eager to flaunt his powers of speed.And any show which ties in huge doses of humour effectively will definitely win the crowd over, not to mention the strong supporting cast of Frozone (long lost cousin of Iceman?) and Edna, the suit designer. (I rate the scene between Elastigirl and Edna one of the best in the show)Can't wait for the sequel (well, they did Toy Story II, didn't they?) to see if Jack Jack gets more screen time!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

And I don't mean this as one of the very best children's film or the very best animation films. I mean, simply put, it easily is among my all time top ten amongst films in terms of overall quality, which includes for me production values, direction, art direction, acting and, primarily, script.It is also a film you can easily see over and over again and catch new and interesting details and quality marks not as easily discerned in previous viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Good family flick----7/10,"While i usually steer clear of family movies, this one had a certain appeal. Not enough for me to pay to see it, but enough that i could watch it for free. And i had a good time. The Incredibles follows a family of superheroes who come out of retirement to save the world. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Samuel L. Jackson provide great voice work, and and some of the flick's funnier moments. I was also pleasantly surprised that the action scenes were entertaining, including a battle with a robot that was much better than the crappy idiotic fights from Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. The film has some amazing visuals, some of which i thought might have been real. The team behind it, Pixar, also made one of the only family movies i really love, Toy Story.As much fun as the movie is, it gets a little slow at some points if your not under 12 years old, and the story is almost non-existent. Still, it is a great movie to watch on a big-screen or with the little kiddies, but nothing to replace a nice R-rated gangster/action/porno/comedy/documentary. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Another Good Pixar Film, but not as Great as Others","It's hard not to like a Pixar movie. I have enjoyed them since I first saw ""Luxo, Jr."" and their other exceptional short films. The animation in Pixar films is extraordinary, but it is the characters that make the movies so enjoyable. Since they are family-oriented, they also have to find the magic that makes the movies entertaining to both adults and children.There are two distinct parts to this movie. In the first part, the Incredible family is trying to live as normal people in society, although they have extraordinary skills. In this part of the movie, the Pixar magic is in full swing. The characters are interesting and the humor is sometimes nuanced and sometimes right down the middle.The second part of the movie is oriented more toward the action and the Incredibles as action heroes. I think this movie is oriented much more toward the kids and I found it to be less interesting.It's still an entertaining movie, but I don't think it is quite up to some of the other Pixar movies such as ""Toy Story"". If you have young kids, it is a good bet. If your kids are grown, as mine are, and you are viewing this with adults, it's still entertaining, but not quite as much of an easy recommendation.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

"Fun movie, but not that original","I saw this movie a few days ago, and it was great. I went to the theater expecting an average movie, and I was far from disappointed.Mr. Incredible is one of the best superheroes in the world. His best friend is Frozone, and he's getting married to Elastigirl. However, when Mr. Incredible saves someone who doesn't want to be saved, he gets sued. And after that, pretty much every other superhero. As a result, all superheroes are forced to stop being superheroes. 15 years later, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl have 3 children (Violet, Dash & Jack Jack) and Mr. Incredible works at an insurance company. Frozone and Mr. Incredible still fight crime secretly in their civilian outfits, and one time Mr. Incredible is hired to return as Mr. Incredible.The Animation was great, although the characters look a little cartoony IMO compared to other Pixar animations like Finding Nemo. Not a big deal though. I specially liked the animation of Elastigirl, when she moves across the rooftops in the beginning and when she hitches a ride on the monorail cart halfway.One thing that was bothering me though, but it's not a big deal if you're not a superhero nut like me: There isn't a single original Superhero in the movie. I can understand that it's kinda the point to make a parody of existing superheroes, but the movie itself is great, they could have made their superheroes a little more original:-The Incredibles: The Fantastic Four. A family fighting crime, and even most of their powers and personalities are the same. -Mr. Incredible: His name is obviously based on Mr. Fantastic from the Fantastic Four. His powers and personality are based on the Thing (also FF) though. -Elastigirl: Mr. Fantastics Powers are stretching, like Elastigirls, even though she uses her powers more like Plasticman -Violet Parr: Invisiblity and Invisible forcefields are The invisible Woman's (Fantastic Four) specialty. -The Dash: His name and powers obviously come from the Flash, his personality is from the Human Torch (FF) -Jack Jack: Franklin Richards, Mr. Fantastic & The invisible Woman's son. No powers yet, but pretty powerful when he does get them. His powers are similar to the Human Torch's and The Demon. -Frozone: Iceman from the X-Men obviously, even the way he moves around (Ice skating on giant ice-roads he creates). -Syndrome: Dr. Doom, Mr. Fantastics former best friend and now the Fantastic Four's main enemy. Syndrome is Mr. Incredible's former fan and now main enemy. Doom and Syndrome both have no powers but a load of gadgets (made by themselves), and they both have a huge land (although there are actually living people in Doom's land). -The Underminer: he only has a small part at the end, but an ugly supervillain that lives underground is really similar to Mole Man, a Fantastic Four villain. -Gazerbeam: You only see his corpse, but a superhero that shoots beams out of his eyes is obviously a rip on Cyclops of the X-Men.Nothing original about the movie, except maybe the story (even though it was really familiar), but like I said if you're not a superhero nut like me probably won't even notice. But I'm gonna be pretty upset if everyone's gonna say that the Fantastic Four ripped of The Ultimates when the FF movie is gonna be released next year.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The Incredibles,"The Incredibles, written & directed by Brad Bird, was very close to flawless. Everything about this film, to the art direction, to the animations, to the script, and all things around it, was portrayed beautifully! The Incredibles won two Academy Awards for Best Animations & Best Sound Editing.The story was charming, focused, and well structured; you really felt like things were on the line every step of the way. Bird did a great job writing a witty and super fun script, while also creating these enjoyable characters, with great voice overs! In this rare occasion with three directors of photography, in Janet Lucroy, Patrick Lin, & Andrew Jimenez, everything seemed flawless, with great animated detail.The music & score by Michael Giacchino, was very up beat, entertaining, and enjoyable, that fit perfect with every scene. Other than My Brother The Pig, this was Giacchino first real big test, and he passed with flying colors.Overall, this was a very charming, family film, that packs a lot of weight, while setting up great for the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

My Favorite Animated Movie Ever,"10/10Guilty pleasure but ages amazingly. My mood movie. One of the best in Pixar and animation. Fantastic characters, action, world-building, script, screenplay, humor, etc. Always a pleasure to revisit from now and when it was released. Ratatouille might be more well-aged and distinct but this film is so flawless it deserves to be recognized. Brad Bird is a legend. Should see at least once in life. The animation my look a little bad a points and not everyone character is fully fleshed out or unique, but come on? It's The Incredibles! Like a bunch of famous writers say, true stories don't tell the whole truth. It hits as emotional as Everything Everywhere All At Once, and is as smart as Fight Club.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Not all that incredible,"Pixar's latest offering, The Incredibles, takes a stab at the superhero genre. Saying it's better than most superhero films isn't saying much; is it really a feat to produce a better film than Daredevil, Hellboy, or Catwoman? The Incredibles does have a nice twist working for it: what if, like some demented Alan Moore comic, the supers were no longer welcome to do their job and had to settle for being normal people? How would they respond to that? That's the basic gist of The Incredibles, and we focus mostly on Mr. Incredible, aka Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson), who is definitely having trouble fitting in. His wife Helen (aka Elasti-Girl, voiced by Holly Hunter) is having an easier time of it. But when an opportunity to go adventuring again knocks on Bob's door, he furtively accepts it, not thinking through the consequences or asking too many questions.By now Pixar has perfected their production abilities. Everything is flawlessly fashioned, and that other world they are able to create, while never before quite so close to our own, is still very convincing here. Though we see few other heroes (pretty much only Frozone, voiced by Samuel T. Jackson), we are given enough of the 'super' world to make everything believable. Pixar tends to excel at world-building, and since this film was handled by the talented Brad Bird, you'd expect nothing less.The problem is, there's a certain indefinable something missing from The Incredibles. It's fun, mostly, and enjoyable, and pretty well paced most of the time; it gets a bit talky in stretches, and the multiple attempts at an ending irritated me (just end the movie already, Brad!). The villain Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee but damned if he doesn't look and sound like Mark Hamill) was well-thought out, even if his major scheme is lifted lock, stock, and barrel from The Watchmen. But unlike other Pixar films, this one seems to lack a little heart. The family scenes with the Parrs are all nice, and the kids Dash and Violet are well-realized, mostly (Dash gets all the best action scenes, especially the one stolen from Return of the Jedi). But this movie lacks that special spark that say, Finding Nemo or especially Toy Story had. At the end of both of those films, I felt a wealth of emotion that actually moved me (Toy Story 2 especially); here, there was nothing, just a recognition that the story had come to a nice place to end. That's not bad, and there's nothing wrong with it, but it certainly doesn't live up to the other Pixar movies (except Bug's Life, which I never cared for).It doesn't help that it feels like you've seen so much of this before. Granted, there are so many superhero films, cartoons, and comic books that we've been inundated with variations on the idea. But while The Incredibles handles the genre reasonably well, there was a LOT of it that reminded me of other movies or stories, and thus at times it felt predictable (which you simply couldn't say about Nemo or either of the Toy Stories). Frozone is nothing more than a well-rendered Iceman; and while Elasti-Girl is pretty original, Mr. Incredible is simply the answer to the question, 'What if you had too much Clark Kent and not enough Superman?' and that's been explored a LOT, given that Clark's had two TV shows in the past decade.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the film. Dash's action scenes are all a great deal of fun, and the Brad-Bird-voice fashion designer, Edna Mode is hysterical  really the best character in the whole thing. But Syndrome the villain is hackneyed, even down to the underground lair and the pseudo femme-fatale henchwoman; if you were going to do a fresh twist on the super-hero genre, why rely on so many clichés? Ultimately The Incredibles is a fun diversion, but little more. A lot of movies would be happy just to achieve that, but given Pixar's track record honestly I was expecting a little more. Certainly it's worth going to see The Incredibles in the theater, you'll have fun, it's just not the keeper that Pixar's other films are and doesn't merit a place on your DVD shelf like their other movies. Or like Shark Tale.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
yeah yeah it's incredible,"okay, we all know how amazing this is, most breathtaking cgi you've ever seen, etc, etc. Yup, it's dazzling, a must-see. But that isn't what does it for me, not the stunning cinematography (if that's what you call it when it's computerised?). No, this film has what Bruce Lee calls ""emotional content"", and it packs a real punch, too.I laughed, I cried, both out loud, nearly shat myself, loads of times. But still, that's not what I'm talking about, I'm talking about the details. Not those sumptuously detailed backdrops, but the emotional details. As well as one big, rollicking story, there are four or five ""wee"" stories, each of the main characters growing individually (at one point Violet says says something like ""well, I think dad's made a lot of progress today, but really we should be going now""). I say ""five"", because really, it's a story about one family, albeit a very ""special"" one.There's that scene where Violet (who is gloriously flowering into womanhood throughout the whole film) puts on her mask for the very first time, and the camera pulls back as she shifts her position ever so slightly, stands upright and proudly *becomes* a super-hero. It's truly magnificent. She started the film looking like that girl from Ju-On, all hair and one big eye.Another, when Dash (who reminds me of Bart Simpson, except funnier, faster, and cuter) has just run his legs off to save the day, and Helen (Mum) tells him how proud she is, he can barely move for exhaustion, but that smile! It says it all. The mother is the pivotal character in the whole film, and keeps it all together, saves the day more than anyone else, too. The scene with the guided missiles, I screamed! Then bawled like a baby! Wow!And when Mr. Incredible tells Mrs. Incredible he's ""not strong enough"", and we realise he means ""strong enough to go on without you"", I literally burst into tears. Incredible stuff! The whole script is so tight, and delivered with such exceptional timing, you realise quickly that you've bought a ticket for one big dizzy emotional roller-coaster that's not gonna stop until the credits roll.By the time I get to the neck-breaking chase scenes at the end, I'm a complete wreck! So maybe I'm an emotional kinda guy, but I can't remember the last time a movie made me cry like this. What I'm saying is, these guys can ACT! What am I saying? It's a CARTOON! Incredible!I'd just finished watching that documentary trilogy ""The Corporation"" a few days before seeing this film, and I reckon this helped me to better understand the corporate satire in the middle. I loved the camera work in that section, all right-angular, particularly the part where Bob sits down and disarranges Mr. Huph's pencils, and again where he's using his hands to demonstrate how a ""team"" works. lovely stuff!Every time the camera moves, there's something new to enjoy, I particularly enjoyed Bob's ""corporate PC"" with the zillion+ wires coming out of the back. Remember who own Pixar?Yes, I could go on and on, the clever symbolism, the fine intellectual texturing, the deep and piercing satire (and I've said nothing about Edna 'E' Mode who just rocks, and steal all her scenes!) but I'm thinking, in the time I could take to really tell you how amazing this film is, I could watch it again! And man! am I looking forward to doing THAT!-fm",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
An instant classic,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. The story is fresh and unique, the characters are strongly written and they compliment each other well. There is even some adult themes to the movie which add depth. (Marriage, raising teenagers, jobs you don't like, deceit, infidelity etc.).Syndrome is a legendary villain. He hates Mr. Incredible and super heroes more than anything and he makes it his personal mission to destroy them one at a time until they're all gone and he can pretend to be the one true hero.I feel this movie is quite possibly Pixar's greatest work. Just can't say enough good things about this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Truly outstanding superhero homage from Pixar,"The Incredibles is another classic computer-animated film from Pixar. Riding high from past successes Pixar decided to do a film different to the norm by featuring all human characters for the first time and giving Brad Bird free reign over the whole project, and it pays off no end with one of their strongest efforts.The story starts off with superheroes Mr Incredible and Elastigirl keeping Metroville safe from crime and getting married. This all stops when people begin suing the 'Supers' as they are forced to quit and go into a relocation programme. Fifteen years pass and they try to live a normal life with their children, but Mr Incredible misses the glory days. He gets his chance via a mysterious call to a secret mission. However he quickly discovers his past is back to haunt him and a plot to kill off all Supers. The plot is excellent as it holds up in so many ways as an actioner and drama with comedic elements. The similarities to other Superhero media, especially Watchmen, are done perfectly too.The cast and characters are brilliant. Mr Incredible is everything a lead needs, he's charismatic and 'super' but he's humane and caring, it makes a very three dimensional character backed wonderfully by Craig T. Nelson's strong voice. Elastigirl is also great being a dominant and getting in on the action, the unique voice of Holly Hunter works a charm. Dash and Violet are also a lot of fun. They don't become annoying like many children do, they have good personalities and their powers are well worked in. Jason Lee was great as Syndrome, who's a superb villain being so unlikable and evil. Samuel L. Jackson is a lot of fun as the cool Frozone and Brad Bird is hilarious as obsessed Superhero costume designer Edna Mode.The Incredibles is almost perfect is every way you could imagine. The action is superb from the many battles on the island to the explosive climax. The pacing is excellently managed, it takes time to develop the characters and lets events pan out with care. The vast amount of homages to Superheroes is wonderful. The way the film builds an array of Supers and has fun with them is a joy to behold. The nods to The Fantastic Four and Watchmen were very impressive. The music from Michael Giacchino is just marvellous moving from heroic to Bond like, the main theme and 'Kronos Unveiled' are just magnificent. The animation is brilliant, all the Supers look unique and are all memorably designed, and everything looks fantastic wherever it takes place. It's also refreshing that The Incredibles is much more older children/adult oriented than anything Pixar has done before or since. It doesn't shy away from the violence and how much the entire family has their lives put on the line. Plus the film must be commended for being much more serious and intense, there are still some great jokes, but its great how it uses the subject matter in a thoughtful way.Overall The Incredibles is both really funny and really well made, it's certainly one of Pixar's best due to how good everything really is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

I certainly didn't think so, and after thinking a lot, honestly i didn't come out as satisfied as animated films like Shrek 1 and 2. I put 6 because its a good animation film, but its more targeted to adults which is nice as kids would obviously want to see it, dragging adults to it as well.

Shattered My Expectations!,"The Incredibles (2004)Review: When I heard that this was from Brad Bird, I was skeptical. Pixar has done some good. I was tempted. Here we go:The Incredibles is truly something else. We already see the great Pixar animation alone that is even better that Toy Story. This movie features a family with the mother and father two former superheroes living in suburbia. Father Incredible misses the days of the past and longs for them again. That's only part of the story.The Incredibles has it all. We have excellent voice acting. From Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, and Jason Lee. They are great here. We also have some truly fast and intense action that I did not expect at all. It will leave you wanting more. Not too violent and not light on it either. Good for the kids and adults alike. You will not be bored.This movie is also quite intelligent. With unique enemy robots to a rather sinister villain, we have a good thing going here. The ONLY thing preventing this getting a 10 is the setup of the story sending our heroes into retirement. I cannot identify with that at all. Sure, it's original, but far to hard to believe. That's the only drawback here.The Last Word: Humor, action, and intelligence. What is there to complain about? Almost the best. Brad Bird is a genius.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"One of my favs, but not a little kids movie!","Pixar did it again! The Incredibles taken primarily as a stretching out on the superhero genre, is first rate entertainment. It also is a very witty commentary on family life. And it is fun fun fun! It seems superfluous to say how good the technical side of Pixar films are, because they all are great! They plan out every detail and edit the scenes together practically flawlessly. Incredibles is no exception. And they keep abreast of inside jokes and pop culture references without sacrificing the story and characters. All technical and story elements are at the disposal of the characters and not the other way around. That is the way to make touching movie experiences!I grew up loving the superhero/James Bond genre, so this film has plenty of fun with that. ""Monolog-ing"" for example. But the Incredibles goes deeper by centering the film around the Parr family's relationships - especially between Bob and Ellen. This anchors the film in the audience's heart.The Incredibles is very violent (especially near the end) and so would be too intense for little kids. But it is a great film from Pixar, the king of computer animation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The Incredibles is not a bad movie. It's not a masterpiece either.,"Since many advised me to watch this movie, I decided not to be a hard head and give it a shot. I wished it was good, since Pixar is one of the most respected digital animation companies around. Sadly, I was greatly disappointed. I am aware I'm stepping on a lot of toes here of people who completely disagree, so I'll explain, or at least try to.Now to start with something positive. The style of the movie is based on the so called ""Kitsch"" art, a mid 50's pop culture style. Which is what gives the Incredibles the indistinguishable look of the 50's and class. Worked out greatly, since It's not an easy thing when you consider the movie is computer made, and the 50's didn't exactly have a lot of that at the time (read: nothing).The movie ridiculous movies of the same time period it style is, like James Bond. And also newer ones like star wars. Unlike Shrek however, it fails. It fails at making a point and it fails at making it funny.Now to the real downsides of the movie. However, simply getting the style and setting of the movie right does not make it a good movie.The movie was empty. Empty, caused by a lack of emotional feeling and an catching storyline. While watching it, I simply couldn't care less about what happened to the characters. It was like watching Pokemon. It's watchable, but hey, nothing happens to call the queen about, it's obvious from the beginning how the scene will end. Which brings me to the script, which ending was also obvious from the beginning. Now, I know that is the case with many many movies, but with the good movies, It's often worked out in such a way the ending is still a revelation. While in other cases, it makes you drop a tear and feel warm inside. None of this was in the Incredibles. The movie ended, and I was untouched. Not just by the ending, but by the whole movie. The best it did was give a little smile from a simple joke.This movie, sadly enough, could have been made by Dreamworks*. Except it did truly attempted, and at some points succeeded to make an animation movie different from all other ones. The Incredibles is not a bad movie. It's not a masterpiece either.*Dreamworks, in my opinion has merely copied everything Disney/Pixar made to make cheap money, ever since Shrek (Shrek II does not count since that is just a sequel of their own work).",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Wonderful.  Fun for kids, and even Funnier for Adults","Pixar has done it again! If you liked Toy Story, or any other computer animated movies, chances are The Incredibles will definitely ""float your boat"".

However, Mr. Incredible is seeked out by a mysterious faction to complete there assignments. The entire family seems to have there own unique power which is necessary to restore balance. There is also and Un-related super-hero who has the power of freeze. In summary, this is a WONDERFUL movie and if you have not yet viewed it I highly recommend it.

Refreshing movie!,"I saw this movie with my girlfriend in Japanese movie theater. I was surprised by the movie since I wasn't really into earlier Pixar things. The movie was spectacular, it had few nice thrill moments and had a nice voice cast. It is also very funny and entertaining. Visuals of the movie is very good and this movie demonstrates how CG has became natural part of animated movie production. In this movie you soon forget that everything is 3D - its like watching 2D animation movie. That's sign of good design. Soundtrack of the movie is very interesting as it combines something straight out of James Bond themes. I recommend! Certainly Pixar is improving movie by movie. But it isn't that I didn't like Nemo, I thought it's a great movie. I gave eight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Substance,"For the things it wants to achieve, I believe The Incredibles does a spectacular job. This movie is simply full of substance. Every character has substance, everyone has a goal, and that is reflected on every dialogue line. Even characters that stay on the screen for ten seconds have substance. They are not filler. They are part of the real world, simply parts of everyday life that get somehow affected by the actions of our protagonists, which in turn reveals their personalities.Dialogue in this movie is so full of charm, and accompanied by some nice humor. The interactions between the family are just on point. I just hoped it was a little slower, a little more paced, so I could process it thoroughly.It avoids extremes. It portrays a family that is both dysfunctional yet loving to each other, showing their progression as everyone comes to their own individual realizations. Likewise, it avoids one-sided villains. They have reasonable goals, but corrupt morals. And this movie is not afraid to show them in full effect.One thing I disliked are its visuals, ONLY occasionally. Otherwise, it has astonishing art direction, which can be seen in full bloom on certain designs, both in characters, structures, and various machines.It's an original work, full of substance. It has meaningful messages and meaningful characters. A case study for character dialogue, in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredible!,"Having started watching Disney films before I was a year old, I can honestly say that I've seen nearly every film Disney has ever released. The original animated Disney films, like ""Beauty and the Beast,"" will always have a special place in my heart, and can at this point not be surpassed by many of the new Disney/Pixar animated films. In fact, ""The Incredibles"" is the only one of these ""3-D"" animation films that has achieved classic status in my mind. It's absolutely incredible.""The Incredibles"" manages to do everything the other Disney/Pixar films have tried to do at once. It manages to pay homage to the golden age of superheroes, while at the same time poking fun at certain aspects of it and almost grounding the whole superhero concept in reality. It poses the question of what would truly happen if there were superheroes in society, and does so in an interesting and compelling ways. The story is also enormously compelling. It's a superhero plot that avoids every cliché that it wants to and includes the rest in purposeful and funny ways. Still, what sets the film aside other animated films is its characters, which are all enormously clever and creative.The ""Incredible"" family is a hilarious and fun superhero family, because they're just like us (except for the powers, which they actually come to loathe). We see a dysfunctional superhero family, which is certainly a first. We also get to see their family friend, Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson), who was very ""cool,"" if you know what I mean. The villain in the mix is Syndrome, an ambitious child-turned-superhero hater and terrorist. Disney does not handle the film with the normal child quality. Death is not avoided, but rather confronted when Mr. Incredible makes his inevitable strike on the ruthless villain. Syndrome is also perfectly rendered, from his fiery hair down to his maniacal voice. He's extraordinarily intimidating and though funny at times, often shows his purely evil self.The film is funny at times, while serious at others. It has great characters, a unique plot, fantastic animation, a great score, and a hilarious script. I'd recommend it to children above the age of 6 or 7 and even more so to teens and adults who were around during the golden age of superheroes. It's a perfect film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Something I got out of the film...,"It mirrors real life events. No, really. I'm not kidding.I scanned the user comments to see if anyone else noticed this, but stopped after the first two pages of comments (Boy! This created a response.)I should introduce myself as an avid comic book reader. And comic historian. So I paid attention to the timeline.As I recall, the opening sequence occurs in the last years of the 1940s. At this point, superheroes are incredibly popular, at an all-time high, swinging from rooftops, saving the day... and then they get sued. Public opinion turns against them. A book, ""Seduction of the Innocent"", is published. The supers are limited in what they are allowed to do. (And yes, in every word after ""1940s"" I'm referring to our world.) They were considered too sexual, or violent, or frightening for children. Those who survived the purge became more ""silly"" (Not saying the stories weren't good, just that they weren't serious.) Only five super-hero characters enjoy continuous publication: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Aquaman and Green Arrow (these last two due to ""Piggy-backing"" on the other heroes' titles) While every other superhero character disappears into the background... until 1960, when the ""Silver Age"" of superhero comics began. One of these breakthrough series was the Fantastic Four, featuring two characters from the Golden Age (Human Torch and the Thing), and consisting of a real ""family"" of superheroes. (Mr. Fantastic married Invisible Girl, Human Torch was her brother. The Thing was Mr. F's longtime best friend and basically brother-figure.)As far as I can see, it was out of these basic concepts that ""The Incredibles"" was born. A family of Supers emerging at the dawn of the 1960's. ""What would it be like if this had happened to real Superheroes? What if the world, in effect, told the Super-people to ""Go away?"" Well, this film fills in that period, devoid of believable heroes, and how they returned.And it tells a dang good mid-life crisis story in the midst of all this.And takes potshots at James Bond, to boot. (Also a 60's staple.)As for the commenter who mentioned that there weren't ""in-jokes"", (and liked that fact, so I'm not intentionally trying to burst your bubble, but...) well, there's a lot of them. It's just that they're fairly behind-the-scenes for the most part, but one of the most direct references was the appearance of (a version of) the MOLE MAN! at the end. (For those not familiar with Mole Man, he was the very first villain that the FF faced, in Fantastic Four #1.) Yep. Okay, I'm done now.All in all, an amazing movie, with a completely different view if you know your comics history.10/10.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
A mediocre celebration of... mediocrity,"Fifteen years ago Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl were at the top of their game, saving the world and being celebrated as heroes by the public. Today they lead ordinary lives under new identities in Suburbia: Bob and Helen Parr, with three kids. The family go to great lengths to hide their superhero powers but once a week Bob sneaks out with his friend to look for some action to provide stimuli in his mundane life. When one day he is offered a secret superhero job, he cannot resist the temptation...First, let me debunk the myth that this is a great animated movie as the outrageous 8.3 rating here boldly suggests. It undoubtedly lacks that sparkle in the eye and it never once reaches the level of hilarity that Blue Skye Studios or DreamWorks Studios offer. As it is a Disney production, expect family morals and heartfelt messages en masse to compensate for the lack of clever things to say. That said, the superhero genre was in dire need of spoofing  Spider-Man most of all  and The Incredibles does a fine job in this aspect. From the villain's mandatory monologue, the burning house to the mad scientists, nothing feels missing or incomplete in the genre.Considerably more things feel incomplete in terms of characters and humour, however. Because they are humans and most of them lack 'assigned quirks' (such as Scrat from Ice Age, or one of the Aquarium fish from Finding Nemo), the characters in the film are completely straight and realistic. Bob, for example, is a middle-aged insurance worker with an expanding waistline and a limited intellect  your average Joe in every sense of the word  it follows then that no amount of flashy superhero powers (which he lacks, even, he only possesses strength) manage to elevate him above generic formula. It is glaringly obvious that the filmmakers, for this reason, expected the audience to identity more with 'Suburbian Superheroes' which would be cool and all, had the audience been middle-aged family men. But it is primarily kids and kids do not typically seek realism.Yet it needs to be said that for all its failures in fun and interesting characters, 'The Incredibles' is a fine film that is perhaps even better sewn together than your average animated comedy. The plot unfolds like a James Bond movie and is appropriately accompanied by a Bond-like musical score. It is an amalgam of a spy-movie, a comic-book flick and a Hallmark family feature. All the ingredients are present for the aforementioned templates and it is mixed by a fully competent blender and sprinkled with impeccable animation and special effects. But ultimately, without any well-placed comedy or bouts of quirky absurdity, the film is a mediocre celebration of mediocrity.6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
For the Family.,A very good entertainer to watch with family and kids.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"""No capes!!""","Just after superheroes Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl tie the knot, a series of insane lawsuits by citizens affected by Incredibles' feats of bravery prompt the couple to go underground as suburbanites Bob and Helen Parr; 15 years and three kids later, Bob is recruited by a mysterious organization to fight a powered-crazed machine on a remote tropical island, but his association with this outfit may prove more dangerous than he's initially led to believe. Disney-Pixar animated adventure has flair and in-jokes--both verbal and visual--to spare, but only the canny opening moments are really engaging (with pseudo interviews and retro newsreel footage). By the second half, it has become another video-game-turned-movie; however, it never looks less than stunning and almost retains its fresh wit to the finish line. Writer-director Brad Bird doesn't seem to mind if the overload of action completely self-destructs, as long as he can get in a few more visual whammies (while mounting three continuous endings--two would have been sufficient). A sequence with Mr. Incredible bound and tortured doesn't work at all, and neither does the second ending with a surprise from baby Jack Jack. The voiceover work is very good (with perhaps too much of Holly Hunter), and the film has amusing and amazing detail throughout, but somewhere along the way the plot comes undone. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Pixar has done it again.,"Pixar has done it again. I was wondering when they would make a bad computer animated movie, but it hasn't happened yet. This movie is just amazing. It is both funny and sweet. I think all families will recognize the problems that this animated family are having. You have a family that all have super powers, you have a villain and a secret island somewhere in the world. How can you go wrong with this? Clearly you can't cause this movie, because although it is 115 minutes long, it is still entertaining and I didn't feel like I was watching a two hour movie. There are comic references to both the young audience and for the adult audience and it is mixed beautifully. As far as I know, this is the first time that there has been an animated movie about a family that are human. So that is pretty interesting. The other thing that really caught my attention was how they did the hair for the young daughter. It looked really lifelike. So will you enjoy this movie? Well if you like the other movies in this genre; Toy Story, Ice Age, Shrek and Finding Nemo, yes you will absolutely love this one. I rate this movie 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

BRAVO!,"First of all, no spoilers in this review. Well, one... watch for the kid on the tricycle. This was AWESOME, the best animation I have ever seen, except for Toy Story (which will always be my favorite Pixar film, unless something really amazing comes out). I LOVE the James Bond-style music, the sly asides to films and cartoons like Dr. No, Star Wars and The Simpsons, and everything else about this film. I have read other reviews here that chide the film for ""copying"" scenes from Return of the Jedi (for instance); what those reviewers somehow missed is that a large part of this film's reason for existence is HOMAGE. This IS all the childhood cartoons I watched on Saturday morning, and James Bond, and the comics, Star Wars, Johnny Quest, et cetera. It must reference those to succeed, and this it does very well. Great art takes what has gone before and presents it again, on a higher, sublime, synergistic level. That is what The Incredibles accomplishes. I think I reviewed this once already, in fact, and I've seen it twice now too! That shows my appreciation of this film as I rarely pay to see a film two times. It is a little long and not for 6-year-olds (there's some fairly serious violence). Still, five stars out of five!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Incredible!,"When you think of track records by companies that are entirely first class in the movie business, you'll be stumped but then consider Pixar. These are the guys behind Toy Story 1 and 2, A Bugs Life, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and now The Incredibles. That is a fantastic CV with nothing below very good. The weakest of the Pixar movies is A Bugs Life but that's only because it had its thunder stolen by Antz. Once again Pixar deliver a superb, exciting, funny, and all round entertaining family film. If anything this is their most adult because the first 40 minutes deals with Mr Incredibles suffering at his boring life, since he was fired as a superhero. The family of superheroes have to hide their powers and it plagues them. There is a surprising amount of everyday life, drama here and this was a brave move for a film primarily made to cater for youngsters. It has a similar thematic depth to it as another Superhero film by the name of Spiderman. They allow these characters to be real people in an extraordinary situation not just making it a simple and hollow superhero flick, all about their powers.The story follows Mr Incredible and his family. For some time they have been living as ordinary citizens after Mr Incredible rescued someone who was trying to commit suicide and the guy sues him. This starts a spate of liable cases against superheroes (a thinly veiled jab at Americas sue happy culture.) and they are forced to live like normal people. This is all very well and good but Incredible yearns to be a hero again rather than a pen pusher. He and his friend Frozone go out on nightly rogue missions to help people getting into trouble along the way. The story soon has the Incredibles back donning their suits to fight a new foe, called Syndrome, also known as Buddy Pine who was once Incredibles biggest fan. They must fight giant robots on secret islands and in Manhattan as well. Rest assured the film is funny and has great action but more than that it is a change of pace for Pixar. This film is not as heavily comedic as their other films. There aren't a whole host of quirky and eccentric side characters. It's not a laugh a minute film because they have some family drama in it and it plays out more like and action movie. It never resorts to spoofing the Hero genre too much which I felt it would probably do. The film is entirely light hearted but it isn't scattered with jokes throughout. Some people may like this change while some may prefer to have more humour but in any case the film is funny enough.Once again the film has the lush looking visuals and pushes the envelope even more than the last film but it works to its degree thanks to the excellent voice work. That has always been a Pixar strength, the fantastic vocal performances. You see some films where the vocal performance doesn't work, particularly in some recent Disney movies like Sinbad. Craig T Nelson is excellent as Mr Incredible and plays it very well, he makes the part his own and you must respect the fact that Pixar didn't just go for the biggest names on the block. The same is true of Jason Lee as Syndrome. The big names come in the form of Holly Hunter, as Elastigirl and Samuel L Jackson as Frozone. In one respect I can compare this excellent casting to Albert Brooks in Finding Nemo, Brooks not one of the biggest stars but he had the lead and did it well, with TV icon Ellen Degeneres superb at his side. These films could easily resort to brining in the Clooney's, Pitts, Farrell's, Blooms and giving them lead parts, without them really being suited to the parts, but they cast the best person for the job. Sure their first film might be accused of doing that by casting Tom Hanks in the lead, but he was perfect for the part of Woody.This is another example of good storytelling combined with cracking visuals and its fun for all the family. It was risky increasing in the serious side and losing some comedy, because it could have alienated the kids, but the pacing is perfect and the youngsters never lost interest when I saw it, they were transfixed. As was I! *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

"Great, but not quite Incredible.","The Incredibles is undoubtedly Pixar's most ""grown-up"" movie to date. It is also perhaps their most ""intellectual"" movie. By which I don't mean that previous Pixar movies were somehow stupid, but rather that The Incredibles, despite being more action oriented, is more a movie for the brain and less a movie for the heart - particularly compared to Monsters Inc, and Nemo.Opening with a quick sequence of interview cuts with the three main super heroes Elastigirl, Frozone, and of course Mr Incredible himself The Incredibles thankfully avoids any kind of origin story for these people. No nuclear powered spiders or murdered parents here. These people just are super heroes. This is the time of super heroes at the height of their power and popularity. Mr Incredible, otherwise known as Bob, saves kittens, foils robbers, and generally does good deeds - all at the same time, and all whilst on the way to his own wedding. Only an obsessed fan boy (literally) becomes a fly in the ointment. Mr Incredible is at his prime, and he works alone.Then everything in super herodom falls apart. People start suing the super heroes, the government picks up the tab, and the heroes are forced into an early retirement through a relocation scheme. Cut to some fifteen years later - no longer Mr Incredible, but now simply Bob, who works in insurance.The movie takes its more serious turn here as it delves into the life of an unhappy Bob in full mid-life crisis mode. Bob longs for the old life. Out of shape and in a dead end job he pines for action, for the adrenalin rush, for the glory days. Married now to Elastigirl - Helen - and with three kids, Bob seems set for a life of mediocrity and all around normality. Whilst his friend Frozone has settled into the quiet life without longing, Bob listens to police radio waiting for his chance to do some good.The super-children themselves are not deeply drawn. Violet is the shy young girl who lacks confidence and just wants to be normal, whilst Dash is the bored little boy who aches to show off all that he is capable of and resents being held back. Jak jak, the baby, takes a back seat - obviously. After all, how much character development can one do with a baby? Yet Jak jak gets his own scene stealing moments and emerges as something of a character in his own right.Bob's big break comes with the appearance of Mirage, a mysterious and beautiful young woman who offers him the chance of a return to the good old times. Bob seizes the opportunity with all he has, like a starving man grasping at a twinkie, and for a while all is well in Bob's world. Again he is the happy, powerful, virile Mr Incredible.Until he is captured by the movie's villain, Syndrome, on a Bond-esquire island full of gadgetry and henchmen.Helen, and the kids, set off to rescue their father. Along the way, of course, the usual stuff happens, the family overcome their respective character flaws and the world is saved.This is not to dismiss the movie at this point, but merely to avoid any further plot details. Even though The Incredibles works best before the island rescue it still works extremely well through the family heroics and the action packed climax. The imagery is wonderful, the action pieces well designed and thoroughly entertaining, and even the sly satire and occasional homage are subtle and clever.For something inevitably tagged ""a kid's movie"" there are dark times - such as the discovery of a hero's skeleton in the caves, - and there are adult quips - such as the drinking games of the henchmen. One scene in particular comes across on two unsettling levels. Bob's discovery of Syndrome's computer, and hence the villain's past actions, comes across as both horrifying and yet strangely Pokemon-like disconnected at the same time.Yet I'm left with the feeling there should be something just a little more. Perhaps it's the well-trodden path the children go through, or perhaps it's the feeling that although The Incredibles does everything technically extremely well it actually breaks little new ground in terms of story or character. The children especially ooze cliché, and the outcome of every single character's arc is never in doubt for a moment.Mostly, though not completely, The Incredibles is somewhat lacking of an emotional core. There are occasional break thoughts here, particularly Bob's interaction with Helen, yet the movie does not fully engage. This is not so much a criticism, after all this is a super hero cartoon not Lost in Translation, but where Pixar's films are invariably emotionally engaging to have one this slight is mildly disappointing.Overall, The Incredibles offers an extremely entertaining time for children and adults alike, with enough smart moments and social commentary for those who want to see them. What it fails to offer is the emotional experience that Pixar movies are renowned for. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

is this a joke?,"I saw this movie with my girlfriend a while ago. I thought it was pretty shocking. I can not believe such a crappy movie can get a better rating than beautiful movies such as Platoon and The Deer Hunter. Those movies actually have some meaning. This is just garbage.Apart from the animation which is, I have to admit fairly good, this movie is probably one of the worst I've seen. Not only is it incredibly boring (which is probably where it gets its name from) it glorifies violence. Killing people is seen as normal and to think little kids will be watching it, thats not a good thing for them. To make matters worse the plot is inconsistent. Also the film wasn't funny. I mean they made fun of Bob Parr's weight so many times that it just wasn't funny anymore. (Not that I personally thought anything in this film was funny). About 2 times in the entire movie, people actually laughed. So thats saying something about the humor content of this film. All in all it's an insult this made the IMDb top 250. Probably all the little kids came on here and gave it tens. Or the population enjoys being bored out of their mind watching a disjointed plot.In conclusion, if your a preteen thats been brainwashed by the media to love this, then I feel sorry for you but at least you have an excuse, you haven't been around very long and haven't had the opportunity to see many good films, yet.

Fantastically Witty Family Superhero Flm!,"The Incredibles presents a family with superpowers that must deal with living in a world where using super powers is illegal. Pixar yet again presents a fun, clever, and original idea to the big the screen for all ages to enjoy. And the execution of this concept is absolutly stellar! Brad Bird's pixar films truly are not made for children, they are made to satisfy adults while still making it something that kids can enjoy.
All four of the characters go through a self-changing arc that turns them into better people by the end of the film. Mr. Incredible learns that his family is more important than his desires, Elastigirl learns that her husband cares more about his family than she is willing to admit, Violet learns that opening up and embracing yourself is better than hiding in the shadows, and dash learns that slowing down every once in a while isn't the end of the world. All of this helps strengthen not only the characters, but also their relationships to one another.
Syndrome is one of the greatest cinematic villains in history. His character and plan is so logical and clever that is has been replicated multiple times in other superhero films (including twice in the MCU).
The film never seems to skip a beat. When our heros are not fighting crime, they are fighting at the dinner table with each other. Every scene has a purpose whether it is for the advancement of the plot or developing the family.

Get a Real Job,"I went on the first weekend to the posh Central London Cinema with my three youngest children to see this film. It was a packed house, full of children. An expectant buzz before the show.A warm up pixar film about a white sheep failed to dampen our mood.Fantastic imagery, amazing skill, technical excellence, but little else. The children became restless, pre-teens all over the cinema started whispering, by the end the film was drowned out by the conversations of parents and children.At the end, dissatisfied, I waited for the comic twist at the end-the titles-hoping for some quirky out takes-not a sausage.Just hundreds of names-I have never seen longer lists.

it is truly incredible,"This is my bankable companion for action, The Incredibles is an action packed and comedy filled computer animation superhero film, which juggles between the superhero life and the suburban life. The movie transcend beyond the natural computer animation that Pixar was used to, it contained an all human cast, that took the winds out of the Pixar animators, due to the intensity of work that had to be done to create these characters. The Incredibles is one movie that you can adapt to with ease, finding fun on every turn.After his disappointing movie The Iron Giant (1999) which has been said was due to marketing gone wrong, Brad Bird was down in the blues and he then focused more attention on developing a movie idea he had been working on for some time, it pitched the idea to Pixar's John Lasseter who liked it and brought Bird on board the Pixar team to make the movie. The idea was about a superhero family, with the father going through midlife crises. Bird's refusal to settle for less caused the movie to go through numerous delays, as the animators had to work out the kinks in creating human skin, human clothing, and hair animation in water, air, fire and smoke, to make the characters look real.The movie does pose some dark parts, with death all well assured and the non hesitant of any of the characters to pull the trigger on the opposing sides, even the children of Mr. Incredible and ElastiGirl were no different, they were not taken unawares or felt any remorse when the opposition died in explosions, while the opposition was trying to kill them, neither were they moved or objected to their parents use of deadly force which resulted into the death of the opposing characters. That is something about the movie that I feel kids should not be exposed to too much.The incredibles was a theatrical success, winning Two Academy Awards for Best Animated Feature and Best Sound Editing. It cleared the box office getting home over 630 million compared to its 92 million production cost. It also spawned out comics and numerous merchandises. At least till date 3 video games have been released based on the film characters and adventures.The Incredibles is fun all the way the kind of fun you get when watching a good action flick mixed with a wonderful sitcom. It is one of a kind and a sequel to this movie is one that I have been waiting for since its release, I just hope I don't have to wait too long.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Delivers on what it promises,"Had it been done as a live-action picture, I don't think ""The Incredibles"" would have been nearly as successful (in a worst-case scenario, it probably would have wound up a dumb parody, a la this year's ""Superhero Movie""); the interplay between live action and CG remains a tricky balance that few filmmakers can convincingly pull off. Thankfully, writer/director Brad Bird has taken his years of creativity (as a longtime contributor to ""The Simpsons"") and poured every drop into one of the best computer-animated films I've ever seen--while the title may sound pompous and hyperbolic, ""The Incredibles"" delivers high-quality thrills and laughs on an epic scale. Part of the fun lies in Bird's own lampooning of superhero clichés while developing a narrative that draws a very valid conclusion about the dangers of fanboy-love. The Incredibles themselves are a family defined by their super-powers: Bob Paar (aka Mr. Incredible, a Superman surrogate, voiced by Craig T. Nelson), his wife, Helen (aka Elastigirl; Holly Hunter), daughter Violet (able to turn herself invisible and put up force-fields), and sons Dash (named thus for his ability to run super-fast) and Jack-Jack (whose hidden talent is saved for the very end); when obsessive fan Buddy Pine (Jason Lee) takes his own superhero-fascination to extreme lengths, it is up to the quirky family (called out of exile after being blacklisted) to put a stop to his plans. The voice-actors fully inhabit their animated counterparts, nailing the human imperfections and weaknesses that eventually equate ""saving the fam"" as an act just as important as Saving the World. While I had considerably less love for Bird's ""Ratatouille,"" ""The Incredibles"" is still a beacon of promise for an extensive animation career to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The humour is not as sharp as other Pixar movies and there were times when I was actually bored. It was too much like a Bond film at times, far too derivative.

Comfortably one of the best superhero movies ever made,"The Incredibles wholeheartedly lives up to that adjective with an exciting animated movie revolving around a super powered family that cares about them as people more than their flashy superpowers. It's a self aware commentary on superheroes well before they reached their peak and the commentary on those tropes is a lot more subtle than the contemporary versions. It's also genuinely impressive how effectively this communicates the soul crushing nature of an office job too.Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are phenomenal together as a superpowered couple going through all the usual marital troubles on a much grander scale with their affection and arguments both feeling genuine. Jason Lee nails the fine line of making his villain feel pathetic without losing any menace when it's required. Brad Bird's own voicework creates a scene stealing character in Edna Mode and Samuel L. Jackson is playing one of his coolest ever characters.Brad Bird's direction excels throughout, especially in the action scenes that put everyone's powers to good use and it operates like a Bond film more than any other genre. His writing is superb as well by allowing the characters to have the sort of arguments that are uncomfortable to watch, making them feel realistic and the stakes are played completely seriously. The way they all grow as a family and become more confident in themselves is immensely rewarding.Michael Giacchino's score is perfect. It's clearly inspired by the classic Bond themes but he takes it a lot further so it becomes a constant highlight that is instantly and deservedly iconic. 3-D animation ages noticeably faster than its 2-D equivalent however, this still looks really good thanks to its grandiose main location and how it makes the superpowers live action films have struggled with the most work flawlessly.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

It's hard to find movies that we all get something out of so that is a win.There's a good mix of action, peril, humour and character. The plot (superheroes struggling to accept normal life) isn't all that original but it does the job.One thing that surprised me is that there are a lot of people that get blown up, crushed, sucked into plane turbines etc. Nothing particularly gruesome is shown but I was surprised at the sheer numbers of deaths shown in a movie aimed at families.I'd definitely recommend it as a family viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Charming,"Ready to become a superhero?Pixar brings to life a family with superpowers with 4 people try to cooperate.Voice talents by Holly Hunter,Samuel Jackson and Graig Nelson and here's the new jackpot",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
How about just The Okays?,"A superhero family, under duress from multiple lawsuits brought by otherwise-well-meaning citizens of the city they protect, goes into deep hiding, a Federal Witness Protection program for those with superpowers.But the patriarch of the family, Mr. Incredible, chafes under his now-mundane existence, complete with a job as a health-insurance claims manager. Poor Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson)! He pines so badly for the good IL' days that he and Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) secretly listen to police communications via a scanner, then rescue people and stop bad guys.On the other hand, Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) is very happy with her new suburban life as Helen Parr. She and Bob (nee' Incredible!) have three kids: Dashiell (who can run really really fast), Violet (who can turn invisible and create force fields), and baby Jack Jack, who appears to have no powers - yet. She's content, Elastigirl is, although she doesn't like it when the family has to move - again - because Bob got fired from another job, usually owing to the use of his superduper powers.So one day when Bob gets a message from a supersecret organization that wants him to thwart an evil robot that can learn from its own mistakes... well, Bob sees no reason to mention it to Helen. Or that he was just fired from his crappy job. Nope, he decides that the company is sending him out of town for a ""conference."" Will Mr. Incredible indeed save the day? Or will Elastigirl (and crew) have to save his sorry butt for him?This Pixar film was a little uneven for my tastes. The first half of the movie dragged noticeably; this half didn't seem very well paced at all. In fact, I even committed the cardinal sin of checking my watch a few times - that's how dull it was. But during the second half, things really picked up. The action was much more ubiquitous, with some of the most eye-popping scenes in animation. Scenes that made one forget that the movie was animated, which is basically the point of the Pixar animators.But because of the slow first half, this movie didn't charm me as much as previous Pixar films had effortlessly done. In fact, the difference between the two halves of the movie is so stark it almost seems as if two directors were responsible for the movie.There are also a few emotionally strong scenes that your youngest kidlets might not be too fond of, aside from the cartoon violence. There is a scene in which Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl argue loudly, a scene that might hit a little close to home for some children. And because animation is looking more and more realistic, it may be more difficult for kids to see this as a cartoon rather than a live-action movie, to a certain degree, so even scenes of typical cartoon-superhero violence might be a little intense. As it is, this is Pixar's first PG-rated movie, so be warned.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The most amazing scene from the movie is when Mr. Incredible attempts to catch Bomb voyage. The next scene I deeply loved was when he forgot to remove his mask at the wedding church. I also liked the side character which is the boy in the tricycle blowing a bubble of gum. His parts were alway funny to me. It was clever for Dash to get away with his teacher with his secret super powers. The best quote from the movie was, "" coincidence? I think not?!""

Incredibly boring and not up to Parr,"What would happen if Superman hung up his cape, gave up his superpowers, and settled down with Lois Lane (or his childhood sweetheart Lana Lang) on the outskirts of Metropolis? For that matter, what kind of life would Batman and Robin have as Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, a plain, ordinary gay couple living la vida loca in Gotham City?That's the kind of question ""The Incredibles"" sets out to answer -- and fails. This animated film could have been a truly funny satire of married, monogamous (monotonous?), suburban society. Instead, it aims for the lowest common denominator and settles for being a cartoon version of your average ""guy movie"" -- an action-packed adventure filled with chases and things blowing up all over the place, but no real heart and precious few brains.The only saving grace in ""The Incredibles"" is Holly Hunter's spirited voicing of Helen Parr (a.k.a. Elastigirl). Craig T. Nelson, as Bob Parr (alias Mr. Incredible), shows potential but is not allowed to develop it to the fullest. The super-children in this little family -- Dash, Violet and baby Jack -- simply fly under the radar. That's a real shame, because Violet starts out as a teenager faced with the universal adolescent task of fitting in and being liked, especially by a cute boy at school. But her character development is as flat and one-dimensional as a Marvel comic book.""The Incredibles"" should have burned as brightly as Krypton's twin suns. Instead, for me at least, the film simply turned out to be as deadly as a fragment of Kryptonite.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Funny animation about a family of superheroes,"Bob and Helen fight crime as superheroes and decide to get married, but they have to give up heroics to avoid legal problems. Their children also have powers, but they have to hide them to maintain the appearance of a normal family. But when the opportunity arises for Bob to return to action, things don't go so well and it's up to the rest of the family to rescue him and together fight the villains.The beginning of the film is a little slow, taking its time to establish the world, the characters and their motivations, but when the action arrives, it arrives in a big way and with an almost incessant rumble until the end. The characters are nice and the animation effects are good with some parts almost realistic. It has a certain retro vibe reminiscent of James Bond and Austin Powers movies. The story can even be said to be predictable, but what are we waiting for here? Shakespeare? Hitchcock? Of course not!

The scary scenes are tolerable for young kids and don't last overly long.

Another Pixar crowd pleaser,Pixar have always had a very adult feel to their movies. The balance has always been quite good between the parts of the film for the kids and the parts of the film for the grown ups. The balance for the incredibles is much more in favour of the adults and I can imagine many kids getting a bit restless especially in the first half of the film.As for the adults this is excellent fayre and slightly darker than what we are used to from Pixar. The super heroes are retired from duty after having a few bad days at the office and have to live through the problems that everybody copes with such as tedious jobs. One of the real oddities in modern cinema is how many of the best characterisations are animated. We really feel for the incredibles as they eventually get called back to duty.Whilst it's not a Toy Story it's still very watchable. 7/10,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Save The Day,"Mr. Incredible is a superhero; or he used to be, until a surge of lawsuits against superheroes submitted by the people they've saved forced the government to hide them in witness protection programs so they could lead normal, anonymous lives. Now known exclusively by his secret identity, Bob Parr, he lives with his wife Helen, formerly Elastigirl, and their three children Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack. He works as an insurance claims specialist, and he's fed up with his pushy boss and his immoral profession, but his wife's worked too hard to build a normal life for her family to abide his nostalgia for heroism.When Mr. Incredible's offered the chance to play the role of hero again by a mysterious informant, he jumps at the opportunity, but when it turns out to be a trap set by an old nemesis he had a hand in corrupting, the whole family must reveal themselves to save Mr. Incredible and countless innocents.I was expecting for this movie to be hilarious or very funny. Well, I was quite disappointed. Yeah, there were a few chuckles here and there, but nothing to make me laugh out loud. Maybe this wasn't a comedy. It's a superhero film, of course. So, I was quite surprise with the fantastic action sequences, filled with explosions here and there and some smart action!The animation is so fantastic (not to mention it's similar to Fantastic Four)! This film much darker than most Pixar films, and a lot more violent. There were even some tense scenes for me, but it was great because it's geared towards kids and adults who could enjoy the movie together instead of having a complaint to take your kids to see this!For a superhero movie, it's a really fantastic one. It's one of the best ever made! The characters are lovable and the story is great! I love Brad Bird's homage to many films and all of that jazz! This is just a great film for the family. The score is also great.Although not hilarious as I thought it would be, this is a great addition to the Pixar films. They always manage to make some of the greatest animation flicks ever made.

I have seen Ice Age, Toy Story I and II, a Bugs Life,Shrek I and II, Antz,and Monsters Inc. and the quality of all of these are getting better and better as the various companies get a good handle on using the computer generated characters.

Pixar Does It Again,"The Pixar team continues its winning streak with this sharp, snappy, surprisingly adult animated adventure film about a family of former superheroes who cannot fit into ""normal"" society no matter how hard they try. I'm actually surprised that kids stayed with this film long enough to enjoy the fast-paced non-stop action of its second half; the film's early scenes are a quite funny commentary on bland, middle-class suburban America and the insidiousness of mediocrity that it encourages, obviously aimed more at its adult audience than it is at the kiddy crowd.My only complaint is that Pixar animation always looks slightly creepy when applied to human characters. The actors and animators do as much as they can to infuse the characters with warmth and to make them engaging, but they can't completely get around the fact that there's a plastic, lifeless quality inherent in digital animation that doesn't exist in its hand-drawn counterpart. But that's not a huge detriment here and doesn't prevent this film from being a lot of fun.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Brilliant film,"Without giving anything away, there hasn't been a better film this year. Hands down the best superhero film yet made. Exceptionally well written, paced, acted, and designed. The voices work well, too. I cannot wait to see this film again, which is not what I can say about most recent films, especially superhero films. Hellboy was OK, but the script by Peter Briggs was obviously an amateur effort. Spiderman was fun, and the sequel was even MORE fun--but like Hellboy, for kids.

Exceptional fare for the entire family,"While I wasn't quite as fond of this C.G. film as I was of TOY STORY II , it was one of the better computer generated films I've seen. Much of this is because like all the better movies of this type, it is marketed and designed for both kids and adults. My brother and his wife have no kids and yet they called me to plead with me to see the film after they'd seen it--and that is why this is such an appealing film. The animation is lovely, the characters pretty exciting and interesting and the story is pretty good as well. Oddly, however, what I remember most was NOT the movie but one of the extras on the DVD called ""Jack-Jack Attack"". For those of you who have not seen the DVD or only watched the feature film, please go back NOW and see this extra as it greatly enhanced the film and provided a nice infusion of humor that the movie sometimes needed.

Mediocrity at its best,"Giving characters a plastic-like appearance might have worked for Pixar's previous Toy Story, but doesn't work in the context of superheroes trying to cope with real life. Mr. Incredible (aka Bob Parr) and family all look like action figures and don't mesh with the film's attempt to portray the hassles of real life.In media and press releases, Pixar writers and animators have expressed a desire to tell unique stories rather than repeat some of the same themes. But apparently, that goal was never given a high priority since old James Bond and Powerpuff Girl elements are not only included for clever parody, but serve as pillars of the plot.The Incredibles never draws audiences into the everyday life aspect, which any viewer can experience without the aid of a screen, nor does it draw the moviegoer into the comic book/superhero realm, which is more of a smash em' up, beat em' down stream of headache inducing action. Giving Pixar filmmakers credit that is due, it should be noted that the film, being filled with likable characters and voices actors, isn't a bad film, it simply promises more than it can deliver. The Incredibles manages to be a mediocre movie, while telling kids and adults to reach their full potential.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
I hate to sound cliché but this truly is an incredible movie.,"""The Incredibles"" is fun, entertaining, visual splendid and it has some great action sequences.The power of this movie is in its great timing and solid main characters. The voice cast consists, unlike many other animated movies out of actors that are not 'hot' at the moment. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are not exactly popular actors, that will draw lots of people to the theaters when you put their names on a poster. That's not why they were cast, they were just simply cast because they have great voices. I've always liked Holly Hunter's voice and accent and it was great to finally hear her in an animated movie. The rest of the cast mainly consists out of people that made their debut with this movie (Except for Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee of course.). Kudos to that, I'm sure they could had attached some big 'hot' names to this project but they went for quality and the best instead of for the most popular.OK the story ain't exactly anything special but the main characters and fun feeling of the movie compensates for this. Also the action sequences know to impress. The action sequences feel like you're right in the middle of playing a computer game.The movie is entertaining and fun, what more could you ask for?Quite probably the most entertaining movie of 2004.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
This movie is like it was made by God Himself!,"Yes, maybe my summary sounds exaggerated, but there's no other way to describe this movie. It should get a 10 in the movie score here at IMDb.Once in a while a truly perfect movie is produced, and in 2004 it was The Incredibles. Everything, from the characters to the smallest details is mind-blowing. Everything in the movie looks awesome, and the character designs are excellent. The level of CG used in the movie is one of the highest i have seen, everything looks realistic, with a little addition of cartoonish look which enhances the overall appearance of characters and environments. The clothes of the characters look so real, its amazing. Their hair, it really looks like if it was completely real.The characters' design are perfect, and they are so likable, no one of them is a waste. All of them have their very own personality traits and it adds to the storyline. And speaking of the storyline, it is very good, it's not some goofy kind of story for kids, it's well written, fast paced and just plain amazing. Also, it's great that it's not really a movie just for kids, it treats its audience as intelligent people and the action scenes are very realistic, it's more like a very violent action movie. There's no restrictions in what's depicted, there's bombs, explosions, bullets (not beams or lasers) and even killed people. The animation and facial expressions are incredibly life-like.The issues in the lives of the characters are also dealt with not in the traditional way, not hiding the more serious or ""adult"" themes from the kids, but depicting them life-like and in a nice non-vulgar or obscene way. The humor is also great, there's no absolutely forced or dumb jokes in the movie and the ones in it are very funny and creative.The sounds are fantastic and it adds a lot to the overall experience. The music is more like jazz, and fits the situations accordingly. I saw it dubbed so I am not sure how was the voice acting in English, though, I am sure it must have been pretty good for the first time, since American actors and actresses have never really been good at voice acting.This movie is a true example of how movies should be made. An excellent option, and i hope I can get the DVD when it comes out. The Incredibles is the closest that American movies can get to Anime and Manga, and it will always remain in my list of favorites.This movie gets a 10 out of 10. No, 100 out of 100!

Pretty much defines my childhood,"Pixar has made an animated movie on all the different aspects that we see and admire in our life - there's Coco on culture, Soul on life and death, Finding Nemo on marine life, Ratatouille on food and Cars on, well, cars. But the one Pixar movie that completely stands out for me is the one made on the superheroes. I have watched The Incredibles about like, twenty times as far as I can remember (almost always in Hindi), I think I have lost count. And yet it interests me the same way as it did the first time. It's clearly because of all the hard work that went into making this movie.The first time I had heard about The Incredibles, it was when it had a Happy Meal toy ad. I used to hate Violet and like Dash because of how that ad used to show her as someone who bosses him around. The reason why it did so was because it reminded me so much of my family, minus Jack Jack. The father, the mother, the elder sister and the younger brother. The entire theme of this movie is that this is supposed to be a family of superheroes. They are also people just like us, living their life in peace and quiet. It is also visible since they easily blended in with the normal people the moment they got outlawed. This clearly showed that the way we always treat them to be either gods or demons, they are more than just that.Another great aspect about this movie is the animation. It is the reason why I liked to watch this movie over and over again. Now of course all American animated movies have great animations, but this is something completely different. It looks and feels more like a videogame. As a kid I used to often play with my Wii remote when Bob broke into Syndrome's lab, pretending it's a game and I'm controlling him. The textures, the way Omnibot moves around, the fight scenes, everything gives a very videogame-like feel to it, something similar to the PS4 Spider-Man or Batman Arkham.And finally what makes this movie so great is the story and the character development. What made the Parrs so likeable? Because each of those characters are lousy, incompetant and just overall bored of their lives in the beginning of the movie. They have everything they need to make their lives fun, but they have no right to use them. So finally when they slowly get to use those powers, they are getting more excited about it and quickly adapt to the situations. In the aftermath of their fight they have made their lives better because now they are a lot more positive about their future.The Incredibles, in my opinion, is a timeless classic. Everyone should definitely see this once in their life. It's one of the movies that absolutely defines what Disney-Pixar is. I'm really glad this movie got all the fame it deserved, and probably a lot more is to come in the future (games, cameos, spinoffs, even more sequels) since I just can't have enough of this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The characters are a complete ripoff of the Fantastic Four. It's not even funny. Throw in an Iceman ripoff and you've got a real question about the originality of this movie.

Some parts were a little sinister... Like the cutest baby morphing into the hideous of beasts!I wonder what I would look like if I was a superhero... and what powers I would possess...

Not to mention fabulous the way the 'supers' (lingo in the film for one with super powers) abilities are employed. Never before has a super-hero movie been able to show how the 'supers' can use their powers in arange of ways and in coordination with other 'supers'. It makes the actions so much more engaging and meaningful - the X-men producers and script writers should be taking notes.I would recommend this film to anyone, simply, anyone.

Maybe it was a way of showing her difference from her family. There are already obvious differences between her and her family. She has black hair while her family had either red or blond hair.

"That's like ""Fantastic Four"", but it's animated","The plot of the movie was really interesting and I really liked it's concept, because not many animation movies are about superheroes. The storyline was kinda well-written, nothing wow. The characters were very interesting, well-developed and kinda likeable. Of course, the graphics and the effects of the movie were very well edited. It was a really intense movie (especially the battle scenes between ""The Incredibles"" and the robots) and there were too many fight scenes. Even though, it was a predictable movie, I really enjoyed it and I would definitely watch that movie again.

An excellent film in virtually every way,"Sitting in the theater, watching the previews for The Mask 2 and a couple of other regrettable films, it occurred to me once again just how mentally insulting most Hollywood films are. Luckily, movies like The Incredibles come along once in a while to renew one's faith in cinema. This is a really fun, smart film. A once-avid reader of comics myself, I loved the various ways in which this movie paid homage to superhero comics; my wife, who never read or collected comics, also thoroughly relished this movie. The CGI is great, but that's not enough to make a film good, let alone excellent. The story is cohesive, and doesn't feel like it's been written by committee. I didn't see any product placement. The acting is sharp. The interplay among the characters is believable. I can't think of any way in which this film could have been improved in any significant way. Even the end credits were cool - probably the best end credits I've seen (only Ferris Bueller's credits are on par with them, although in a very different way).Which reminds me - although the end credits are visually interesting, something like 90 percent of the audience decided to leave without watching them. Now, I'll grant that end credits are often pretty boring, but when they're so lovingly rendered, it just doesn't make sense for people to ignore them.My wife and I rarely buy dvds, but this is one we want to own.

Good For Mr. And Mrs. Incredible!,"There's no doubt animation-comedy is in good shape nowadays: Shrek series, Toy Story, Monsters, and this The Incredibles are good examples of it. Sometimes those comedies are much more good than the usual Hollywood ones.The story is as follows: the society has forbidden the ""work"" of the superheroes so Mr. and Mrs Incredible have to go on with a normal life (he works as an assurance agent, and she's a housewife). Did I mention that they got two children? Well, they do... Soon they'll be involved in serious troubles because of the menace usual bad-guy...Tons of references to the superheroes-genre, a lot of funny dialogs and situations. It's not Shrek, but it's quite a nice and entertaining comedy. For the youngest and for the oldest... Nobody will get disappointed.PS: Here in Spain we've had to ""suffer"" the horror of some poor dubbing (specially Ether Arroyo's work). Why don't they dub the movies with the same dubbing actors they use in the standard movies? Jesus, I hate when they do that.*My rate: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Edna Mode looks like Anna Wintour!!!,"The incredibles is definitely one of the most stunning animated movies I have ever seen. I was amused when I saw that Edna Mode (designer of the superhero suits) looks like Anna Wintour from Vogue. Exactly the same haircut, glasses and clothing and she is freaky!!! I was wondering if anyone else noticed this comparison. Moreover, it is a wonderful movie with really cool scenes and characters with a big heart. The music is stunning and the voive overs of all those great actors like Samuel L. Jackson (a.k.a. Frozone) is really amazing.Greetz,BT",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Carried by great animation and action,"The Incredibles describes a period in the life of two ex-super-heroes and their young family. When Mr. Incredible loses his ""normal life"" job, he discovers a suspicious job offer that requires his super abilities. This brings him out of retirement without him explaining it to his family. Eventually, the job develops into a large scale scheme. This is mostly done to set up a rivalry between Mr. Incredible and Syndrome, a troubled villain whose anger was spawned from Mr. Incredible's rejection of him as a sidekick.Syndrome is a stereotypical villain: a selfish and remorseless man that somehow has access to a lot of technology and employees to carry out damage onto society. He is flat and unlikable. The good guys (primarily the Incredibles family) are also very stereotyped, and do not really show any deep emotion. I guess it is supposed to reflect what we expect super-heroes to be like, but it leaves a little void when trying to understand them. Even so, the characters are used creatively in the action sequences, especially the ones that combine all the abilities together. The animation was top notch quality and flowed smoothly. The music was exactly what you expect super-hero music to be. It went good with the action sequences, but not much else, and got dry by the end.The Incredibles is a great kids/family movie, but does not have enough essence to make an impact on older viewers. There were some good parody moments and unique action sequences, as well as plenty of comedy (I loved it when Syndrome remarked ""You caught me monologuing""). Recommended for all viewers, but especially the younger ones.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Pixar can't do anything wrong, it seems.","They can't.From amazing story lines, to the most realistic animation available, to the funniest jokes, the best characters... to values, morals...They can't do anything wrong. Every movie they have released so far rates as high as they can in my opinion.

The Incredibles,"Well, what can I say about this movie? When I first heard about it, I thought it would be a major bust- but after seeing it my verdict is........ THE BEST ANIMATED MOVIE OF ALL TIME! Sorry about the outburst, but in my opinion- it is. The interview of the main 'supers' at the start of the film- I laughed my socks off! Honestly, you must see it.The characters that I love are- Edna and elastigirl. Edna is the fashion designer and is.......... i can find any other word to describe her apart from hilarious and elastigirl/Helen Parr is just the coolest mum you could ever have (apart from the fact she is a super hero).The plot isn't thin and the characters are totally lovable- especially Jack-Jack.I give it 10/10 and would like to end with a quote from the movie: ""that was totally wicked!""

This movie is incredibly good!,"Since I saw the first trailers, months before the movie came to theaters, I already knew this was a great movie. The way it is structured, the story, the intelligent humor, everything was done in such a smart way that this movie must become a classic by itself and possibly could redefine the animated genre and take it to a new level. I have not yet seen the previous Brad Bird's movie (The Iron Giant) but it was well received by the critics even if it was not a box office success, for whatever reasons. I believe that even if this movie was made to entertain, it also was made thinking of all kind of persons, not only children but adults as well, maybe some parts of the movie will not appeal to the little ones but at the end, it will be a great entertainment for children and adults as well. Each of the characters is well developed and most of them are smart in their own way and very fun to watch.

surprisingly delightful,"I praise Pixar for bringing animation films to a totally new level. It never ceases to amaze me how they roll out products that continue to amaze a wealth of generations and backgrounds, while somehow bringing them all back on the same page for a wonderful night out that is sure not to disappoint.The Incredibles is a film that is surprisingly multi-faceted, striking chords in ways that I didn't even expect. The plot is simple: Mr. Incredible, a superhero who is all about glamour and power back in the days when superheroes were normal in everyday society (there's an interesting thought for you...) is forced to retire when he gets sued because he injures a man trying to commit suicide by grabbing him by the neck when saving him. Sounds like such a modern day dilemma.As a result, not only is he forced to retire, but the government officially shut down the superhero business permanently. As a result, to save the numerous superheroes who basically lost their jobs, they're granted amnesty and forced to relocate and mesh in everyday life. After this 'tragedy,' we join Mr. Incredible who is now married to his superhero wife Elastigirl, and now has to live life with three kids, a dead-end job, and a mid-life crisis seemingly so depressing that makes me feel sorry for him as a young adult!But, that's all I will share with you. With it's recognizeable Pixar trademark action sequences, as well as its relation to humanity and the values we hold dear such as family and normality (this is the first Pixar film to portray humans), the Incredibles surprisingly delights for kids and adults. The kids may miss some of the deeper themes embedded in this film, but the adults should pick them up real easily, with the kids enjoying more of the action sequences especially out of the kids in the Incredible family.If you're looking for a great night out, give the Incredibles a try!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Great Movie!,"This was just fun for everyone. I saw kids as well as teenagers and older adults enjoying themselves in this movie.

I like how he goes from wannabe sidekick to archvillain. Very nice. I especially like how he can take on the Supers without any ""real"" powers. Too bad he's the bad guy.Anyways, good movie.

Simply Incredible,"A family of super heroes, enjoying the quite suburban life must once again fight the world of villainy and crime within there world, this time to not just save there world, but there family.In my opinion this is the best of the Pixar films and one of the best animated movies through Disney to be made in a very long time. Now I'm not an avid Disney or Pixar watcher but this film I did enjoy very much. Great blend of comedic action as well as a decent script that can appeal to adults as well as kids alike. With most animated films the actors can only do their job through a voice over and the principal actors in this film do an excellent job. Simple in its story and in its pacing anyone an follow this film, but what truly makes it stand above the rest is its scope and how easily it engrosses the viewer. By far this is one of the best Pixar films and one i can easily recommend to adults as there are several point brought up in this film that will easily engross and become relate able to its adult audiences.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Good fun, but not outstanding","You can't expect anything less than top quality from Pixar, and with The Incredibles, they certainly deliver.The main issue I had was the simplistic style. If you've seen Finding Nemo, you'll know that it's full of subtle jokes and references to popular culture, something that is almost entirely absent in The Incredibles. It's those subtle jokes that keep adults interested in a movie like this. Of course there are tons of references to comics and their superheroes, but these are inaccessible to the general viewer.The Incredibles is also lacking in verbal humor compared to Nemo. It's disappointing to watch The Incredibles and wonder where the jokes are, once you've seen what Pixar's capable of.Following a general trend in Pixar movies, the graphics are a step up from Finding Nemo, which showcased the Pixar team's skills at simulating water and its interaction with light. The Incredibles showcases their particle effects; i.e. explosions, dust, etc. There certainly are rather a lot of explosions. The Incredibles is eye candy all the way through, but primarily to someone who knows how to judge computer graphics (as I do). The graphics aren't stunningly beautiful like in Nemo, but they are very technologically advanced.The action sequences are outstanding, in particular the sequence on the island with all the family members. Their superpowers complement each other very well, to combine into a very satisfying and enjoyable sequence.All in all a good movie, worth seeing. Can be enjoyed by kids and adults alike (but be warned there are a LOT of explosions), just don't expect the high sophistication and sheer graphical beauty of Finding Nemo.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Fit for any Superhero,"Disney's imagination and Pizar's awesome animation techniques combine once again to produce another slice of fun for the whole family.The Incredibles is faithful to the superhero genre, albeit with a tongue in cheek humour that operates on several levels beneath the simplistic yet effective storyline. With plenty of laugh out loud moments and some more subtle humorous undertones, the incredibles has enough to entertain most of us.Although the Incredibles lacks the charm and sentiment of Finding Nemo, it makes up for it with action and excitement, and it's a different movie experience.

Unlike most Pixar movies, this one had some good action scenes, I was quite surprised and very impressed at how the fighting and action was choreographed and done in computer animation. I could talk about the movie, but that would be pointless. My only advice to you is to go see this movie and enjoy every single bit of it, like I did.

The soundtrack is totally original. Some cues are reminiscent of a Bond film, but sounds nothing like a Batman or Superman film. The music is all over the place. Buy the soundtrack and listen to Track 9: Kronos Unveiled. Very melodic, slowly increasing in intensity. The end titles kick ass and all the other tracks are excellent!

"""Oh, come on! You gotta admit this is cool!""","How worth it is ""The Incredibles""? Let's consider the evidence:1. Writer-director Brad Bird has ""The Iron Giant"" and ""The Simpsons"" on his CV, making him ideal to oversee an animated movie that's very funny and very thoughtful, while also delivering messages without ramming them down your throat or otherwise talking down to the audience.2. This disproves the theory that animated movies of two hours' duration are exclusively a Japanese thing (the secret: all killer, no filler).3. ""The Incredibles"" wears its influences well - the notion of superheroes having to hide their powers from a world that doesn't really appreciate them is very ""X-Men,"" but it never plays as a ripoff. ""The Return of Captain Invincible"" (also about a superhero coming out of retirement) also precedes this, but it doesn't handle its premise as well.4. The movie has a very 1960s look, but it's not interested in going the Austin Powers route and sending the whole thing up - the movie's got humour, but it plays its core situation and the character relationships very straight.5. As wonderful as ""Finding Nemo"" was, its title character was a bit nondescript; here all the main characters are fleshed-out humans, from Mr. Incredible to super-speedy son Dash, and even the villain.6. The movie has action to spare, but it's the little twists thrown in that make it work (it's heartbreaking when Violet tries to activate her forcefield at a crucial time and can't).7. ""Alias"" composer Michael Giacchino's excellent score deserves an Oscar nomination at the very least. (Walt Disney Feature Animation and DreamWorks please note the lack of songs.)8. The voice work.9. Elastigirl - the real leader of the family, and the most attractive animated crime fighter this side of Kim Possible.10. ""When everyone's super, no one will be,"" the arch villain pronounces. And ""The Incredibles"" proves that we need the ""Shark Tale""s and ""Home On The Range""s of this world - just as the movie itself shows that we need special people to stand out from the mass but also need people who AREN'T superheroes, we need the dross to truly appreciate the gems.This movie stands proud with the other Pixar movies, and also alongside recent non-animated superhero movies. It truly lives up to its name.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"An ""Incredible"" triumph in the genre of super hero movies.","I am not the biggest computer generated movie fan there is, but I have to hand it to Pixar, they made one of the best movies of 2004 with this hit ""The Incredibles"". In fact, of all the movies I saw last year the only one I rank ahead of it is another super hero movie ""Spider-man 2"". Of course, I enjoy super hero flicks so they had that going for them. This movie centers around a super hero forced to live an ordinary life after certain problems arise during a rescue of a person falling from a building and a train accident. The super hero (Mr. Incredible) isn't adjusting to life as an ordinary guy to well. He keeps helping those in need even at the risk of losing money for his company. I found this trait most endearing, because it showed he was not in the biz merely for the glory, but that he truly wants to help people. So much so that he goes out one night a week with his old super hero buddy ""Frozone"" and they stop some crimes. However, when Mr. Incredible gets an invitation to go to an island and do his super hero thing he leaps at the opportunity. Eventually, this leads to his capture and the rest of the family must come to the rescue. Every aspect of this film was great, I loved that this film was actually rather long as it is one of the rare animated movies that really has a chance to develop a good story. You aren't going to be to surprised by many things, but here you just do not need to be surprised. The voices are all great headlined terrifically by Craig T Nelson and Holly Hunter. Good laughs, good action, and an all around good movie are awaiting you in this little treasure. I especially liked Dash's sprint through the forest.

Most over-rated film of the year,"This really isn't a very good movie. It's just that simple. The story line is weak, character development all but non-existent (the most interesting character is the costume designer who is clearly based in part on Edith Head), and most important it just plain drags. This is not to say that the movie doesn't have its moments. It's in fact a perfectly OK ""flick"" but it is nothing special and it is a big disappointment coming from Pixar whose previous work has been so good.We aren't told why Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl were attracted to each other and we don't see much of their relationship. I guess we're just supposed to accept that all superheroes eventually get together, or something like that. Their children are introduced and then sort of float until the plot needs their help. The motivation of Buddy is too easy, not very interesting.The notion that Mr. Incredible is driven from crime-fighting by law suits is inventive and funny. That the government would pay the judgments is -- well, incredible. Comic book superheros do not work for the government or even accept pay from the government. They generally exist more or less in a netherworld between government power and the world of crime. But the Incredibles end up in the superhero equivalent of the witness protection program.

Not your ordinary CG-animated movie,"Animated movies are tricky to make. You have to write a great story that is compatible with animation. Then you need good animation. Lastly, you need the right kind of voice actors for your characters. As of late, the CG-animated movies have been flying into theaters and have been doing really well. This movie far above all the Shrek's, Ice Ages', and all of the other contenders. This movie is incredible.The Incredibles is Disney/Pixar's latest achievement in CG-animation. The story follows a family of real super heroes. Mr. Incredible or Bob Parr (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Elastigirl or Helen (Holly Hunter) have three children. There is Dash, Violet, and baby Jack-Jack. Jack-Jack is the only one without a super power at the moment. The others have some interesting talents to compensate. There is Mr. Incredible's astounding strength, Elastigirl's ability to stretch to mind boggling lengths, Dash's lightning quick speed, and Violet's cloaking ability and the power to create force fields. The problem with their powers is that they cannot use them due to a ban of all super powers back before the family was together. All super heroes were forced into retirement and kept secret with relocation and the government making sure they stay hidden. But all of this is about to change.When a menace in the jungle rises up, Mr. Incredible is contacted by a secret agency to remove the problem after being spotted on saving people with his buddy Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson). Mr. Incredible's feels that this is just the jump-start for superheroes to make a comeback. What he doesn't know is that his past is about to catch up with him.This isn't just an ordinary CG-animated film. This film was nominated for four Oscars, winning two for Best Animated Film and Best Achievement in Sound Editing. It was also nominated for Best Achievement in Sound and even Best Original Screenplay which is quite an honor. Obviously, this means that not only was the animation great and technical aspects good, but the story was good enough to contend with live-action movies like Eternal Sunshine or the Spotless Mind (won Oscar for Best Original Screenplay), The Aviator, Hotel Rwanda, and Vera Drake. This movie was a contender with the ""big boys"". This is a huge step for animated movies of all kinds.Along with the story and the awards, there is a great cast of vocal actors. Nelson is perfect as Mr. Incredible making him sound macho, tough, and also concerned about his family. Hunter is flawless as his wife who's worried that her family is slipping farther apart. Jackson is funny as Frozone and Jason Lee gives his voice to Syndrome and makes him quite convincing.The Incredibles is a must-see movie and should be in everybody's collection.

The Layman's Word: The Incredibles,"What a film! The Incredibles is simultaneously fancifully melodramatic and viscerally real. It is fun and smart in simple ways, but not without filmic savvy. Honestly, it's the best superhero movie I have ever seen.Pixar has broken the mold.It was good to see (or hear, as it were) Craig T. Nelson back in action again. Sarah Vowell, a funny and talented writer and radio commentator, proves herself in this - her first film role. All the VO work was top-notch, but I was most impressed by young Spencer Fox as Dash. His delivery is flawless. He really had his character nailed.From a cinematographic point of view, this movie is ingenious. Every shot is emotive. In a live-action movie, cinematography can only do so much. Most of the emotional energy needs to be generated by the actors; the best shots and angles and set dressing in the world won't make a bad performance any better. But in animated films, the actors' performances are designed down to the smallest nuance; this, I believe, can make an animated film's energy more reliable. The camera work in The Incredibles is a shining example of how competent film makers can make this advantage work.I was worried that the plot would be rife with pop-culture references. Thankfully, that was not the case. The movie's story is adequately fantastic, but it stays grounded all the way through. That is to say it is a human story. And it's interesting - which is something even many live-action movies fail to accomplish these days. All the characters, even gimmicky Edna Mode, were functional. There was no one in this movie whose sole purpose was to deliver chillingly bad topical zingers and catchphrases; and I find that quite refreshing. Every character had a purpose, and that makes the plot. When you pack a film with allegorical one-liners about society or politics, you de-emphasize the plot. But this movie, as I said, stays grounded. It has a good story to tell and it doesn't sell its soul to marketers (see: Shark Tail).All told, The Incredibles is probably the most entertaining movie I have seen in years. It is what a good movie should be, and it made me feel the way a good movie should make people feel - happy and excited and inspired. Watching it, I couldn't help grinning like a goofball.

I just didn't personally care that much about it. I can't really say why, it's just my preference. For me, the best part is Holly Hunter as Elastigirl. You would think that I might like the sequel since she's the star of that one, but I like #2 even less. Wish I could be more helpful, but I guess the fact that a movie is really good doesn't mean everyone will enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Increíble!,"Wow! ""The Incredibles"" packs quite a punch. Have you ever heard yourself say ""it's animated? psh, that's for kids."" This movies will change that forever. ""The Incredibles"" is filled with action and entertainment that will have you on the edge of your seat. The animation is absolutely breath-taking and the characters are creative and lovable. You'll find yourself lost in the world that Pixar has created and awe at the stunning visual effects that make ""eye candy"" seem like an insult. Bring the whole family! ""The Incredibles"", aside from the action, is clean wholesome fun. Every member of the family will find something for themselves in this film. (However, I would not suggest bringing toddlers because some scenes may be too intense.) Drama, comedy, and explosive action are all integrated into the film, creating possibly the greatest animated movie of all time. Even if you enter the theater with skepticism, you'll leave with the feeling that you've witnessed something incredible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Not impressed...at all,"Nearly every person who likes this movie mentions something about the art and CGI. Even though I'm not drastically in love with either Star Wars or LoTR, I'd much rather watch THAT kind of CGI and appreciate it rather than pretend I'm enamored by a cartoon. Granted, the graphic art was the best part of this film, but there is not much else that's even good.I enjoyed the film enough I suppose, to sit through it once that is. The story is adequate at best...anyone could write it. Yeah, there are some dispersed messages relating to life in general, but they feel preachy and forced to me. The film really never found an identity in regards to genre. Granted, this isn't always a problem, but it was here. I was confused the whole way through, waiting for a spot to laugh and trying to figure it if the drama was serious. The end effect was that it was not really ever funny and rarely had me waiting to see what developed.The voices were decent, but I felt Jason Lee was ripped off by the animation. I think he knew where to go with the voice, but it didn't pay off in the graphic rendering of the character. Some of the script really disappointed me, e.g., ""I'm not strong enough...to lose you again."" Please, spare me. Again, I didn't buy into the drama.To be fair, this is a kid's film (I'm definitely convinced this has no place among the ranks of non-kid films) and it passes nicely as one. Also, I tend to be unimpressed with most animated features, many for the same reasons as above. However, I knew this was below par when my wife, who loves so many Disney and Pixar films, looked at me at the end and just laughed (it was her second laugh in those two hours). It turns out that she was laughing about how mediocre the film was, which is quite the opposite of her reaction to most other Pixar productions.I still give it a 7 out of 10, for two reasons. First, the CGI was impressive. Second, it was a solid kid's film, which is what it was meant to be in the first place. Why everyone is raving over it though, I really cannot understand. If I actually believed (like many people are saying in reviews) that this was meant primarily for adults, I'd easily drop it to a 4 or a 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredibly INCREDIBLE!,"What a film!Brad Bird's movies hit you on so many levels, so unexpected for an animated movie.

It's American --- and it's ironic!,"The Incredibles is not just an impeccably crafted entertainment package, it is self-mocking and ironic, qualities that rarely inhabit the American soul. It is a scintillatingly gifted production, but as so often, being American, it wants to supply more than just enough, so it's a wee bit long, and a wee bit convoluted. But these are only quibbles: it's hard to imagine anything more compelling for the juvenile mind --- except experiencing it in three dimensions. The sound is super: in our home we have cinema surround-sound and some of the effects were highly dynamic, zapping your ears as well as your eyes. Highly recommended for wild distraction and some moments of hilarity. Definitely watch it beside your children.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Technically amazing and thats not even the good stuff.,"The core story, if I took the time to think about it is not that funny.Basically it is about a man who has lost his self-worth, sort of like a ex pro footballer trying to relive the glory days.Fortunately the way Pixar handled the story MAKES it very funny. It is light-hearted and in very good and amusing taste.The CGI is nothing short of amazing,and the face close ups on these cartoon characters almost look real.All the voice actors are perfect, all the gags set up and animated with great comedic timing.The story is fast enough moving to keep any kid from about 4 to 400 glued and laughing for its full length.The villain is , in my mind, not going to scare any children, so tho this is not as ""kid friendly"" as say ""Finding Nemo"" it is still perfectly acceptable.I laughed and was amazed all the way through this movie, I watched it with my whole family and they enjoyed it as well as I did.Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The incredibles,"A perfect movie.From the animation to the story everything in this film is just appealing for anyone. The contrast between the incredible super powers and the boring everyday lives really does reflect our real world, how people had the opportunity to make the world a brighter place but blew it, how some people are forced to wear masks and hide their true colours. This movie shows how films don't have to be complicated and confusing, it shows how simplicity is sometimes more complex and engaging than complexity and that's something movies lack these days. Directors think their film has to be deep, modern and complex but the truth is that life is better lived simple. One of my favourite animated films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The Incredibles,"Pixar's sixth feature-length film is a very different approach to what they are usually associated with  instead of going with the ""cute and funny buddy-movie"", they have instead gone for a more action orientated approach, resulting in an unfamiliar yet no less entertaining film.The story centres on the Parr family, consisting of Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl  who were forced to go into a superhero relocation programme when the weight of the American legal system crashed down on them after Mr. Incredible is sued for rescuing a man who didn't want to be saved from jumping off a building  and their three children. Fed up with working in a dead-end job as an insurance clerk, Mr. Incredible longs for the good old days of saving lives and stopping villains. When a message comes through asking for his help he finds himself unable to resist the call to duty, but finds himself and his family in more trouble than he thought.The inspiration for The Incredibles is obvious, as it takes off from just about every superhero film ever made, and sometimes it is even possible to guess exactly what film was the inspiration behind a particular scene. However, what the story lacks in originality is more than made up by its personality. The film is quite stunning to watch, raising the bar yet again for computer animation to follow (putting even Shrek 2 in second place), and the action scenes are all incredibly well put together. The script is also excellent, and although it is primarily an action film, the comedy that Pixar is so famous for has not been left out, with some truly laugh-out-loud moments dotted throughout the film (special mention must go to Edna, a 'Q' style character voiced expertly by the film's writer-director Brad Bird).The Incredibles does not, however, try to give too much to the audience by simply piling on action-scene after scene relentlessly; it's too clever for that. In fact, after the beginning sequence, the superhero powers and costumes are not really showcased again for most of the first half of the film, allowing a slower paced introduction to the Parr family's new life. This is probably where the adults in the audience will find the most memorable scenes  it is a clever satire on the American legal system and an amusing take on suburban life, playing more like a domestic sitcom than anything else.Both halves of the film, although made up of almost separate genres, mould together perfectly and result in a satisfying film to watch, which will certainly entertain all age-ranges. It may not be as classic or as funny as Pixar's other films like Toy Story, but it certainly proves that they are capable of more than just repeating their usual buddy-movie formula and provide some variation to their work. Pixar, it seems, are still going from strength to strength.Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Should you take your kids to this?,"You've landed here looking for what I was looking for and didn't find, a non-judgmental review by a conscientious parent that is detailed enough to contribute to your decision on whether or not you should bring your young child to see this film.Naturally, you're interested because this is the first PG film Pixar has released and so you don't have a gauge. Maybe like me, you love all Pixar films. Have you seen Iron Giant? It was written by the same guy who wrote and directed ""The Incredibles,"" Brad Bird. If you haven't seen it, it's also a great film and has a lot in common with this film, though the subject matter of this film is more mature than Iron Giant (Iron Giant was, ironically, about the issues around solving problems with violence. Incredibles is mostly about mid-life crisis).Here's my credentials: I have two kids ages 4 1/2 and 1. I am a strict disciplinarian but I don't have any set of religious morals I am trying to get my kid to espouse. I believe that violence begets more violence and is not a means to an end nor is it a way to solve problems. I also realize that kids are under social pressure to watch certain TV shows and movies in order to be considered cool and that sometimes I'm going to have to relax and just let my kid be a kid and satisfy his curiosity.Enough with the background: Incredibles is a movie with characters most kids would love. But it is laden with mature content: violence, domestic squabbling, office politics, and subtle humor that left my child repeating ""What are you guys laughing about?"" You won't be able to explain the complexities of the humor to your child in the movie house and by the time you're done with the movie, your child will have likely forgotten what he/she was asking about.The shooting and fighting abounds, though there is no death. There is more shooting and fighting per minute in this film than in Pokemon or Power Rangers. For some reason though, we parents seem to be more forgiving of comedies than of action/adventure, perhaps because the point of action/adventure is the fighting and comedies at least are about something else besides the fighting. Some young children might be scared, though my 2 (nearly 3) year old nephew saw this and had no problems and he's afraid of monsters hiding under his bed.I took my 4 year old to see this and I wish I had waited until this came out on DVD to show it to him so that I could explain whenever he got confused. He was very caught up in the tension of the movie and was often so concerned about the fate of the characters that he would ask ""What's going to happen to so-and-so?"" I'd simply whisper, ""I don't know. Be quiet and watch to find out."" But it didn't do any damage as far as I can tell and now whenever I want my son to do something quickly I pretend to be Mr Incredible and get him to pretend to be Dash, the young kid superhero in the movie who has superpowers akin to The Flash. It works like a charm. And now that he's seen it already, we're going again because it really is a great movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Very enjoyable family film,"This was a good film for all the family. Once again Pixar and those people at Disney have put in enough humour for the grown ups along with all of the good clean wholesome fun that you want your kids to see. There were no moaning kids during this film, even though the popcorn had run out well before the trailers started. It's quite long, 2 hours, which is long for younger children but they sat still throughout the entire film. In fact the kids were so impressed my older two took themselves off to the cinema with their pocket money to see it 3 days later.I wonder, did other adults notice how they'd modelled the older daughter on Sadako from Ringu? It was just something some adults might spot and would have one over on the kids when it came to one film fact.The story follows the lives of two superheroes who after getting married are forced to settle down in the wake of public opinion no longer wanting superheroes. The kids they have, also become super-powered and soon enough the world needs superheroes again. The film is great fun with good effects, a fun soundtrack and likable characters. There are plenty of laughs and kids will be comparing who is the most powerful or has the best powers after it's over.I'd have to rate this up there with or possibly above similar types of films such as Shrek and Toy Story. I'd say it was a better film than Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo.Definitely a good movie to see.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Yeah....... incredible,"I haven't seen too many of these computer animated films.... but this one really stood out for me. I think the animation is very well done, roughly in the style of 1960s ""speed racer"" type films.

I kinda hope they find new villains for the ""Incredibles"" sequels that are sure to follow.I didn't want to see this film because of all the hype around it, but if you can get past that and just take it for what it is, ""The Incredibles"" is a movie that will entertain everyone in the family.

The best film Pixar has made so far,"Without using the title adjective, it's hard to describe this movie and still capture all it represents. Just when we thought Pixar Studios simply couldn't top the genius of the Toy Stories, Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo, etc...they go and do it again. This time, however, Pixar elevates their game and content to a whole new level that makes this film a possible Oscar contender for not just Best Animated Film. Oh no. We're talking Best Picture of the Year. Why? Watch it and you'll understand.Meet the Incredibles: Bob Parr (aka Mr. Incredible)- a superman with amazing strength, speed, and heart who after a series of lawsuits and anti-super sentiment must give up his superhero days for suburban life. Helen Parr (aka Elastigirl)- a superwoman who can stretch and bend herself in crazy ways to fight off evil doers or stop the kids from fighting. The kids- Violet Parr, very shy teenager who can turn invisible and create forcefields, and Dash Parr, a hyperactive superfast kid who wants more than anything to be able to run as fast as he can. Jack Jack (the baby)- superpowers? maybeThe Plot: Bob Parr is bored to death at his insurance job, so when the offer comes to resume his superhero work undercover, he leaps for it without telling his family. In an attempt to find her husband who she suspects is having an affair, Helen Parr finds she is accompanied by their kids who have left Jack Jack in good hands. So that I don't spoil the fun, let's just say the Parrs/Incredibles run into a whole lot of trouble before uniting into an awesome crime fighting family.This summary is far from complete, but I'm telling you, give this movie a chance and you'll see what I mean (hopefully). I don't want to spoil the best parts, so I'm leaving a LOT out here, so watch a trailer to get an idea of what the animation looks like and other information.

One of the best satires I have seen lately,"Helen: ""Everyone's special Dash."" Dash: ""That's just another way of saying no-one is.""Polititcal correctness is one of the most detrimental things to cinematography. It says today that guns are bad, so the cannot be portrayed in kids movies, and that all kids movies must feature violence in a way which does not harm anyone. Thus, many kids movies make up the most creatively stupid ways of defeating ones foes. Another politically correct thing is to declare that all people are special.The Incredibles is by no means that sort of movie. Pixar, and my hat is off to them for doing this, decided that they needed to shake things up before they went they way of Disney and started making bad cliché movies. to do this, they brought in Brad Bird, a minor director to bring in something new, thus spawning the incredibles.The first time I saw this I didn't like it. The second time I saw it, it became one of my top five kids movies. What I have realized though is that this movie is not hilarious. This movie is satiric, and though it is funny, much of it is making points about the everybody's special philosophy. It demonstrates that America so wants everybody to be special, to the point that it disables the extraordinary. It makes this point very well, with a well written script, good characters, and good animated violence. For the first time since iron giant were guns actually used in a kids movie. It wasn't graphic, but it wasn't stupidly peaceful. It actually hinted at the fact that man is mortal, unlike spy kids.Samuel L Jackson was hilarious. I personally would not have seen it again if not for him, but I loved his character so much, even when I thought I hated the movie.

They've produced another movie that is so much more than mere animation.The animation itself is breathtaking. They somehow manage to make it look very cartoony but remarkably real at the same time - almost like a cross between CG graphics, claymation and real materials. The way they handle hair, fire and water in this is simply unbelievable.Setting the visuals aside, though, this film would be great if no animator had ever come near it. The script is genuinely funny and beautifully timed, the characters are good, the story is very simple but it works really nicely and the action sequences are magnificent, flowing displays of computer generated brilliance.

Truly Incredible,"Brad Bird struck gold when he dreamt this up.I will not spoil the story for the few who haven't seen it at this point, but let's just say that The Incredibles' story is more than just a slight kiddie version nod to Alan Moore's nightmarish landmark comic The Watchmen, and any fan of the Fantastic Four would be interested in the similarities in the story, accompanied by animation virtually flawless- especially in the action sequences,Pixar keep on surpassing themselves.What's also cool is that is has none of the typical Disney shoot-you-the-head way too PC moralistic sentimentality- an adult can happily sit through the film and laugh at the in jokes the kids will miss without feeling like you've been bashed over the head with a message.The story, characters, everything about it is truly incredible.The film is flawless.Go see it.Excuse the lousy pun, but it is incredible.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Nicely executed, but actually one of Pixar's less incredible films","I have to admit that I put off finishing this tale of superannuated superheroes for many years because of it's Randian overtones: Atlas involuntarily shrugged, if you like, with the vision of its evil villain a world where 'everyone is super, so no-one is'. The start of the movie is certainly fun, but it mocks a world recognise more in the 'polical correctness gone mad' stereotypes than the one I actually see around me. The message is thankfully tempered by the tendency of said heroes to actually cause disasters only marginally less severe than the ones they are saving people from, and the end of the film becomes more of a straightforward action movie, thankfully less solemn than the likes of Christopher Nolan's 'Batman' films but scarcely more absurd than a typical James Bond. There are good laughs (and typically stunning graphics) in this film, but overall, there's just a little less charm than in Pixar's finest offerings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The Incredibles left me in a foul mood.,"The Incredibles left me in a foul mood. I am a big Disney fan but this particular animated feature disappointed me at every department. I) The plot is very simple, predictable and, thus, completely unexcited. II) No humor. I mean it. I did not laugh, even once (OK it is very personal remark since senses of humor differ, you might have found it to be hysterically funny) III) The characters are primitive, not captivating.. I found nothing interesting about Bob, Helen and their kids. IV) Yes, lots and lots of special effects. But there is nothing behind them.

Yawn. Pixar does it again.,"As you probably know, ""The Incredibles"" is the latest effort from Pixar, the animation company that produced a few movies you might have heard of (""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"", etc.). Not a bad track record, and one that The Incredibles does nothing to damage.The plot itself doesn't contain anything extraordinarily unique, but it does combine familiar elements in a singular way. Take one part superhero movie, add in typical familial issues, shrink it to the level of ""Spy Kids"", animate, and you have The Incredibles. For this family with various super powers, the problems arise when they are forced to abandon their alter-egos for a normal life. Their difficulties adjusting to suburban life are juxtaposed with common family issues that are all humorously impacted by superhero problems. Despite the borrowed themes, the film still succeeds, due to the precise amount of seriousness written into the quality story and animation.Somewhat like the James Bond movies, ""The Incredibles"" smartly doesn't take itself too seriously. Often accompanied by a score of also Bond-esque wailing horns, the tone of the film is serious enough to make the events matter, yet loose enough to inform the viewer that the creators understand the clichés that pop up throughout. You can envision the writers winking when the characters use the word ""monologing"" to describe the speech a villain makes right before his imminent demise. In ways like this, the movie gently and self-referentially pokes fun without the not-as-kid-friendly acid tongue of Shrek 2.Unlike previous Pixar work, which dealt primarily, with worlds unseen (toys, bugs, monsters, fish), ""The Incredibles"" is a human story. Superhumans, yes, but still humans. This creates a greater challenge, as making animals and toys sympathetic is significantly easier than doing the same with humans, who need to be more rounded. But the movie uses numerous pieces from recognized types to accelerate audience connection with minimal introduction, diving directly into plot advancement.Rather than lazily using those stock characters as a crutch, the movie deftly churns the known types into unique combinations. For example, everyone knows about the practically impervious superhero (Mr. Incredible), but he isn't very often a married father of three. Everyone knows about the shy teenage girl (Violet), but how often can that girl literally be invisible? This mixture of types forms the foundation of the movie's superb humor, which is largely based on the colliding worlds. I.E., what does a superhero do when an emergency arises while en route to an important event? Simple, he checks his watch, sees that he has time, and saves the day.Because of the familiarity of the plot and characters, this is an important feature, as the film could easily have lapsed into superfluous clichés. Some will undoubtedly cite this triteness as a slight against ""The Incredibles"", but I would compare it to ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", in that both movies simultaneously pay homage and parody the genres they reference, while still providing an expressly entertaining two hours.As expected, the animation is once again stellar, not in an ultra-realistic way, but in the fully three-dimensional manner that Pixar has established. The character design is what stands out though. Since the story is set in a comic book world, the characters are all exaggerated in one way or another. Dash, a fourth-grader, is excessively short; his sister Violet is supremely slender; Mr. Incredible has a massive torso, etc. These physical features serve as personality traits of their own, and further acquaint the audience with the fictional cast. The rest of the world is similarly semi-real, which effectively matches the semi-real nature of the story and characters and completes the look for which Pixar is known.Again the voice talent excels without distracting. Too often (""Shark Tale""), animated movies try to make the vocal actors the stars in lieu of highlighting a quality story. By generally eschewing A-list names for less famous but equally talented actors like Craig T. Nelson (Coach) and Holly Hunter (Thirteen) whose voices ring a bell but don't stand out, ""The Incredibles"" presents the animated equivalent of an ensemble cast. Even Samuel L. Jackson, whose voice is probably the most recognizable, doesn't draw undue attention.This is the first Pixar film rated PG, and the rating is fully justified, due to plenty of action, explosions, and even a touch or two of innuendo (although it will likely go unnoticed by young children). If ""The Incredibles"" were live action instead of animation, a PG-13 would definitely have been the result. I wouldn't advise many against seeing it; just be forewarned that the movie is more mature than previous such films. The crises are a little more serious, the danger is more ""real,"" the humor is edgier. Not better or worse, just different.Following in the metaphorical footsteps of Looney Tunes, ""The Incredibles"" continues Pixar's tradition of animation excellence in entertaining both children and adults. While this film is a step in a more mature direction, it maintains the youthful exuberance and wry sense of humor that permeate all of Pixar's work.Bottom Line: One of the year's best. Call it a high 8 of 10, maybe a 9 as it grows on me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The film is very impressive and all the voices from the actors were phenomenal and my favorite character from the film was Samuel L. Jackson's Frozone. He was hilarious. Overall, an excellent movie that will entertain you very highly and Pixar will not fail in making a bad movie. I highly recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 9.5/10 **** A",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
... wow,"what are you doing here? sitting behind your computer, staring at the screen. GO SEE THIS FILM RRRRRRRRIGHT NOOOOOW !!!it's brilliant, fantastic ... even ... (dare I say it) ... INCREDIBLE!the story, the characters, the design (oooh my GOD, the design), the music. everything comes together in this film. the actors chosen to voice-in the Parr family and all the side characters, are all in the same league as Ellen Degeneres in Finding Nemo. You know what?! I lovvvved finding nemo but i have to say this ... director Brad Bird has just set a new standard to which all cgi animated movies will be compared. shark tale pales in comparison, even shrek or its superior sequel can't hold a candle to this one.a stunning piece of work. 9/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Shrek Meets A Lite Version of ""Kingdom Come""","Unlike DC's futuristic graphic novel series ""Kingdom Come"" which implied the children of heroes and villains unleashed Armageddon, or even Marvel's ""Earth X"" which had similar results by the heroes own doing, the premise of ""The Incredibles"" is that the very people they sought to help were ungrateful jerks - When a suicidal jumper sues for the right to die! This one act leads to an avalanche of suits against numerous heroes and eventually their forced integration into Society As We Know It...Thoreau spoke of men who lead lives of quiet desperation, little realising how apt it was for Bob Parr, the ex-Mr. Incredible (very well characterised by Craig T. Nelson, whose history as an ex-football jock turned coach as well as a Commissioner of Police groomed him well for this vocal role - BTW: Ironic that Michael Chiklis... also a former Commissioner... plays a superhero too, The Thing of the Fantastic Four from which this movie under review pays tribute to), now forced to be a Claims Adjuster for an insurance company with an appropriately blood-sucking little leech for a boss...However, Bob chose not to let the song die in his heart unsung and live to fight another day! At first, it was very quietly, using the company's own intricacies against it, and then finally he chose the Johnny Paycheck route, and boy - he did so in Spades! As Bob, not Mr. Incredible, he goes ""bowling"" on Wednesdays with his buddy the ex-Frozone (equally superb casting with Samuel L. Jackson - who gave the movie's best quote: ""Woman, where the hell is my Super Suit?""), but what they're really doing is listening to Police Scanners for minor crimes they can help ""solve"" with their ""incredulous"" abilities - an ultimate way of ""chilling"" with a buddy! Bob's son, Dash - short for Dashiell, like the man Hammett... an old private eye who was a real hero and and author - almost stole the show as the little Super who was not ashamed of his ability, and it's very obvious Bob is proud of his son. His sister Violet for most of the movie looked a bit like the Grudge...One question remains begging is if Syndrome would still exist if Bob took Buddy under his wing, or maybe Buddy would be so much hamburger due to severe grandstanding? Perhaps that can be explored in future instalments? Their powers were Fantastic Four-ish (especially the creature who was obviously a take-off on ""Mole Man"" at the end). But the music amazingly was like James Bond, and yet it fit in well with the film, I hope they stay that way! This movie is good... but for the sequel? I think there should be an origin of ElastiGirl, Bob and Frozone and hopefully an expansion of Jack-Jack's abilities! Also I want to see more of Bomb Voyage, the idea of a French Joker looks rather intriguing!! Pixar did well, I hope they successfully break away from Disney altogether and do their own thing, they seem to need little impetus to do well on their own! http://tinyurl.com/3464k/",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Pixar the action.,"Another film rewatched and reviewed in my quest to earn the 2006 Oscars badge.Outlawed and retired from his prime as a superhero, Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) is frustrated with his dull job and, though he loves them, his family, despite their powers, aren't providing him with the outlet he's looking for. He's provided with another opportunity for greatness when offered the chance to takedown an experimental robot that's loose on a tropical island.I never particularly loved ""The Incredibles"", I'm not sure why so I was hoping this repeat viewing might clear it up. Visually it's not aged particularly well. The faces of the characters are lacking definition and plasticy and though the ice, fire and explosion effects are decent, water and wetness is not as well done. Vocal performances are good throughout and the future/sixties vibe works pretty well.Storyline wise its ok, but it does take quite a while to get started. There aren't that many genuine laughs though but the action picks up once the whole family make it to the island.I do, in retrospect, prefer it to its sequel but in terms of both the superhero genre and the standards of animation now, its light years behind something like ""Into The Spider-verse"". Of course, without ""The Incredibles"" and its massive success, we probably don't get these subsequent films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
I saw it. Absolutely INCREDIBLE,"I got to go to the first public screening of this on Monday, and holy holy holy crap.This movie is absolutely incredible (har!). I'll even go out on a limb to say it's the best pixar movie yet. I got to talk to the director and got his autograph on a poster too, in an unrelated side note.Pixar movies always have some of everything and something for everyone, but this one had MORE of everything and MORE for everyone. On top of that, in many ways it could be a standalone action movie, whereas previous pixar movies had to support their action with sight gags and comedy - they've evolved to being able to keep the viewer on the edge of his or her seat with straight-up action.I'm trying not to say too much because Brad Bird asked us not to give anything away, but I'll say that the preview, as awesome as it is, really doesn't scratch the surface. Right from the opening scene I was laughing, and straight through I couldn't stop. Even the tense suspenseful parts, I found myself laughing at the sheer *goodness* of it, if that makes sense.I can't wait to see it again on Nov 5!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The Incredibles,"It's got a sort of ""Batman"" meets the ""Man from U. N. C. L. E."" feel about it as the ""Parr"" family try to get on with their lives after their brave and courageous superhero existence was kiboshed by some daft lawsuits and government cold feet. Thing is, there's no such thing as a well-earned retirement and just over a decade after they were consigned to obscurity, dad ""Bob"" is summoned to a top secret summit where he quickly discovers that it's going to take all of his - and his family's -considerable powers to stop the world from imminent destruction. No, the plot is hardly original - or incredible - but the script and characterisations here are really in kilter as the creatively animated adventure hots up. There's fun in the dialogue for the kids and grown-ups alike, and though maybe a bit on the long side, it's a lively tale of espionage and science with it's fair share of gadgets, gizmos, family strife and even an impenetrable, armoured, steel baddie. The pace becomes hectic and enjoyable and the action builds up nicely before a denouement that isn't the best - it just screams sequel at us. This needs a big screen to enjoy it at it's best and has some engaging, spy-themed, nostalgia for those of us north of forty too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Very Disturbing,"I really feel this animated, rated PG movie is way to violent and should have a higher rating. I watched an edited version from Clean Films, so it did have some things edited out, however there was no way they could edit the violence because then you would have been left with nothing to watch. Had this not been an animated show I really feel that it would have had at least an R rating because of the violence. Guns, bombs, shooting at kids, babies turning into devils, babies being dropped from the sky, robots trying to kill people, throwing people through walls, choking people, hitting people, and the list could go on. I'm sorry but this does not describe a PG movie and shouldn't be animated which catches our kids attention!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
An incredible movie,"The Incredibles was the first Pixar movie that my older brother ever saw, and these days, it's a favorite of both of ours to watch. He used to really hate it, but times change! And there are a number of things to love about this movie.Set in a retro-futuristic take on the 1960's, the movie centers around Bob (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) and Helen Parr (Holly Hunter), a married couple of superheroes, known as Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl, respectively, who, for the last 15 years, have been forced to live by their secret identities, after the government outlawed all hero work, due to a rise in both ignorance and ingratitude causing a downturn in public attitude toward superheroes. As much as Bob adores his wife and kids, he longs to relive his days of crime-fighting and helping people in need, and one day, just after losing his job as an insurance agent at the dishonestly-named Insuricare for assaulting his sleazeball boss, he gets his chance, when he is summoned to a remote island for a top-secret assignment. This draws the entire family into a confrontation with a vengeful obssessed-fanboy-turned-nemesis of Bob's, Buddy Pine (Jason Lee), now under the alias Syndrome (he originally went by IncrediBoy).The animation, as is to be expected from Pixar, is truly fantastic, even for the time the movie was released. All the characters are excellently and distinctly designed, and their movements are very expressive and fluid. Every set piece and texture, from the humans' skin, to the trees and bushes all over the island, to the buildings in the Parrs' home city, is beautifully rendered, to the point that it even holds up today, and that rather pesky ""plastic human"" look that plagued Pixar's oldest movies is just about gone. And the cinematography is fabulous, too, like a genuine superhero movie! That said, the only issue animation-wise is that the color scheme is a little gray and washed-out at times.And all the characters are extremely fleshed-out and well-written. Bob is very heroic indeed, and more than enthusiastic about helping others, not even afraid to face danger. Helen, meanwhile, acts as the voice of reason. She's no-nonsense, and unlike Bob, well-adjusted to giving up life as a hero, but she's still headstrong, witty and, well, flexible. Even their kids are great! Violet (Sarah Vowell) starts off shy and reserved, but not without a temper, but she gradually gains confidence as the movie progresses, and shows off more of a sarcastic streak. Dash (Spencer Fox) is very mischievous, cocky and competitive, but he's still just as heroic as his parents, and cares about his family. And baby Jack-Jack (Eli Fucile) is so adorable, though he doesn't really get much of anything to do (at least that we see. I won't spoil anything). And Syndrome is a truly sublime and memorable villain, and you would just love to hate him! Even the supporting characters are enjoyable, especially Bob's best friend and fellow superhero, Lucius Best (Samuel L. Jackson) aka Frozone. Though he's meant to be hated, Bob's aforementioned sleazy, nasty and callous boss, Gilbert Huph (Wallace Shawn) just doesn't fail to make me laugh. But of course, my personal favorite character in the movie is Bob's old friend, eccentric costume designer Edna Mode (Brad Bird, the writer/director himself!). I LOVE her, and really wish she was in the film more. She's nuts, she's quirky, and she has some of the best moments and lines (""DAHling!!!!!"").The voice-acting is tremendous! Craig T. Nelson is very proud, adventurous, heroic and fun as Bob. Holly Hunter is very sharp-witted and practical as Helen. Samuel L. Jackson is delightfully funny as Frozone, giving what may be his best PG-rated performance. Jason Lee is fabulously ruthless and sadistic as Syndrome. Even Brad Bird is deliciously comedic as Edna! He actually ended up voicing her himself after he couldn't find any woman who could do her weird, German-Japanese accent the way he wanted it, and he does a terrific job. And Wallace Shawn is downright hilarious as Huph. Everybody is perfectly cast!The writing is great, too! The movie has thrills and action galore, that always has you on the edge of your seat, and is even heartwarming at times. It also has a great message about allowing everybody to use their uniqueness to its advantage. Of course, the movie also has plenty of comedy that doesn't fail to make me laugh, for instance, the fight at the dinner table. But a lot of it is also supplied by Frozone, especially in the scene of him arguing with his wife (""Where! Is! My! SUPERSUIT?!?!?! WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE GREATER GOOD!!"" ""Greater good?! AH am yo' WIFE! I'm the greatest 'GOOD' you are EVER gonna get!!"" HAHAHAHA!!!). By the way, be on the lookout for a brief appearance by two elderly men, voiced by AND modeled after Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, the last two members of Disney's Nine Old Men to have passed away (""That's old-school."" ""Yep. No school like the old-school."").And, lastly, let's talk about the music! Michael Giacchino's score is majestic, bombastic, exciting, bold, dramatic and heroic, especially his main theme. It really helps to enhance the onscreen action, and sounds suspenseful and heroic exactly when it needs to. There may not be any songs, but the score compensates for that with strong themes and hooks. Just the way all good musical scores should do for movies!All in all, The Incredibles is exactly what its title and themes suggest; it's an incredible and super Pixar movie that holds up better then ever, 20 years later. It's got a fabulous script, great animation, and loveable characters. Everything you'd want from a good Pixar movie! All around, it's quite easily one of the best movies Pixar has ever made, and if you're a Pixar fan, it's a must-see!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Take THE SIMPONS and X-MEN , put them both in a blender, and five minutes later you get THE INCREDIBLES.","One of my favorite pixar films since Toy Story 2. The Story evolves around Mr.Incredible(Who is basically like Batman with the strength of The Incredible Hulk) a superhero at the top of his game. Who marries a superhero named Elastagirl.But after a series of lawsuits, Mr Incredible and every superhero are forced into retirement. Now It is 15 years later, they are now known has Robert and Helen Parr. He works for an insurance company, and she is a housewife. They have three children, Violet(who can turn invisible and make forcefields) Dash(who can run about the same speed has The Flash) and Baby Jack(powers not yet determined) and almost forgot Elastagirls power is she can flex farther then anybody.

Please don't quit making movies like this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Adult entertainment,"An animated film that's decidedly not just for kids. In fact, kids (or adults who just want to see fart jokes and explosions) will probably find this film to be pretty slow and boring. Which, of course, it isn't.The Incredibles is really a super hero/Bond tribute that deals with some rather grown up themes. There's still plenty of humour, not the laugh-out-loud kind, but more of a low key, intelligent one. It even seems wrong to call it a comedy - think of it as an action adventure, only animated.Seeing this film, it's surprising that no one has dared to do an animated version on something like the Superman, Batman, or the Hulk (after all, the latest live action versions of those franchises really sucked). There's no need for photo realism, if the source material is a comic book anyway, why not go for it and make something different? The Incredbiles' plot may be far from just that, but it's a set-up that works pretty good. The voice work is, as always, fantastic. The fact that the characters have to adapt to their voices, and not the other way around, makes it seem more ""real"". It's a pain having to listen to re-dubbed versions with each country's own ""acting talents"". Subtitles is always a better alternative (unless your entire target audience is made up of kids).What really makes the Incredibles so fun to watch is the amazing/incredible/fantastic/brilliant/superb animation. The movie has a style of its own, and the sets and action sequences are simply mind-blowing. This is a film that absolutely should get a sequel. [8/10]",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

This film makes Shrek look like a low budget film. This is a film you must own. Do not rent it. Own it on 2-DISC DVD COLLECTION SET. Trust me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Great movie tainted by subtle propaganda,"While I loved the humor and animation of the film, is it possible that I'm the only one who noted the hidden pro-America/war-on-terror messages within its plot?In the opening cartoon, the ""American Kangajack"" teaches all the other animalsa new, happy way of life (his way of life), and saves them from their despair.None of the other animals' nationalities were noted.Then we see ElastiGirl proclaim ""I'm not going to settle down. And leave savingthe world to men? Yeah right!"" And then shortly after we see her as thedomestic house wife, not only unemployed (unlike her husband), but evenopposed to the idea of employment (or reliving the glory days).The first villain that we see is a very stereotypical French man, complete with astriped shirt and beret.Then we are delivered such wonderful lines as ""Mom and Dad's lives could bein danger... Or worse, their marriage!"" Followed by the innocent child'squestion, ""Why do the evil people want to hurt our marriages?""The villains of the film are described as abnormal and beyond the caliber of anyevils the Supers have dealt with before. The mother even delivers thefrightening line, ""They won't hesitate to kill you"" to her children.At one point the villain even mentions ""selling [his] weapons to other countries."" And creating a world in which no Supers (superpowers, anyone?) exist, andthus everyone is super (the commie!).And according to the film's portrayal of what is obviously New York City, Samuel L. Jackson appears to be the only person of color who lives in Manhattan.Overall, the film is an entertaining, funny, and an enjoyable adventure. And though some would discredit my observations as conspiracy theory or liberalspin, it is impossible for a intellectual to ignore the (intentional or unintentional) pro-America, pro-war-on-terror, anti-French, anti-gay, pro-WASP-nuclear-family bias that is subtly injected into this film.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"a good movie, BUT ...","... not incredible. Perhaps I went in with expectations too high. For sure, Pixar comes through with another brilliant animation display. The neverending variety of scenes, many at high speed, are enjoyable to watch on the big screen. Character development is also good. Each Incredible is given a decent amount of screen time though Mr. Incredible is the featured hero throughout. I enjoyed Dash, the young boy flying around at incredible speeds. So, what is not to like? Well, as good as the movie is, it drags with a 2 hour running time. There is humor here and there but not enough to compensate for the lengthy dialogue sequences. ""The Incredibles"" carries itself like an adult drama too often, and the kidlets in the theatre I was in were getting restless. It is like an animated James Bond, with all the chase scenes to go with it, and talking too. Too much in fact. Though I enjoyed it, I did not leave feeling compelled to see it again. Neither did my 10 year old nephew. That makes ""The Incredibles"" good, but not great. 7/10 Note: wouldn't recommend it for younger children, too intense and scary for the young ones",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"""You know I'm retired from hero work.""","Oh how far we've come. Remember back in the 1980s when a computer generated cartoon character of a guy in sunglasses looked so ridiculous that some thought computers had no future. After the success of the Shrek movies and Finding Nemo in the early 2000s, the computer revolution reached a crescendo with Disney/Pixar Studio's movie The Incredibles. The richness and scope of the scenes in The Incredibles is what makes the movie so watchable. The story is pretty good too, a solid superhero story that appeals to both kids and adults, with a sly sense of humor that will entertain. The use of a newsreel montage takes older viewers back to the a day when all of the news came in grainy newsreel stories that had their distinctive narrators. But the punchline comes with the real modern concern presented in the newsreel: citizens suing anyone and everyone. The Incredibles tells the story of Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and his wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) and how they cope with life after superheroes were ""retired"" by the government over growing legal concerns. The couple have three children, two of which have special powers of their own. Mr. Incredible takes on the name Bob Parr, with wife Helen, and kids Dash (Spencer Fox), Violet (Sarah Vowell) and baby Jack Jack, as they live a normal, boring life where they can't exhibit their powers. When Bob is given a chance to return to his suit, he takes it, working for someone named ""Mirage"" (Elizabeth Peña) who ends up working for the dastardly Syndrome (Jason Lee), who was once a huge Mr. Incredible fan. Mr. Incredible gets into big time trouble, and it's up to his family to save the day. The family becomes liberated at the notion that they can partake in their magic powers, and the energy of the movie really picks up. This leads to some standard chase scenes, but they look great due to the wonderful computer animation techniques used by the film makers. The richness of the colors and details on the screen pack the punch needed to make the silly movie believable. Samuel L. Jackson also plays a superhero, Frozone, who is mainly a background character. At nearly 2 hours long, The Incredibles is lengthy, though never tedious, and is the longest completely computer generated movie to date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Great fun,"A great hero action family movie that lives to expectations. Great animation, great plot, (black) sense of humor, family trifles, and great characters.The script has themes and projections of other superheroes movies, like Spiderman, Batman, or Spy Kids, among others, but all the elements are well mixed up, creating an organic original story that stands to the genre. This is a bunch of superhero stereotypes or deja-vues superbly reinvented. That's a merit of the director and of the script. On the other hand, the dubbing is really good too and very engaging.I also loved the tones and retro look with golden colors, and a retro- ish clothing and hairdos, and the general atmosphere of the film.Despite being an animation movie, you soon will forget that and immerse yourself in the story.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The concept seems to be a mix of the Bond movies and a touch of True Lies. The characters have been clearly immersed in reality, even named after the stereotype mother that is in reality expected to be made of stretch material to maintain the obligations and demands of her family.

It allows time for each superhero to shine and show off their abilities. It gives us what we want to see. The parallelism between being heroes and a family was simply just outstanding, beautiful. It is so wonderful how these writers can mix in family theme with the ever-so-popular superhero theme. One sits there being able to relate to one's own family.

I found it to be surprisingly action-packed for a Pixar film, and perhaps a little heavy-handed on the ""we are all special"" note. Compared to the absurd charm of Antz, or the mocking humor of Shrek, this film is quite straight-forward: the humor was largely slapstick or just absurd. However, Holly Hunter puts in a shining performance as Elastigirl, and Brad Bird, the writer and director, did a splendid job on voicing Edna Mode, the aforementioned fashion designer.

Living in an ordinary world...,"There are elements of the animation in this film that are quite staggering. The hair and fabric especially look so lifelike that you begin to wonder where it's all going to end. I caught a bit of a Formula 1 race the other day; the camera was located in the driver's cab so that we could see what he saw and my first thought was how much it looked like a video game. Thankfully, the likes of Pixar aren't content to simply amaze its audience with its computer images but also devotes time and care to the storyline of superheroes trying to fit into an ordinary world.The film, although immersed in bright and saturated colours, has a dark undertone that will fly over the heads of the kids at which it is primarily aimed to hit the their adult companions square between the eyes. We're all super-heroes in our own eyes  or we'd all like to be  and our powers are constrained only by the mundane chains of job and mortgage with which we bind ourselves. Couple that with a yearning for the glory days and you have either a recipe for depression or a launch pad for wild fantasy. The film acknowledges the fact that we're all different, but doesn't patronise its audience by pretending we're all special. It's OK to try to be something more than we are, just stay within society's rules and values as you try.The film provides a few belly-laughs too.

"Pixar strikes out in an ""Incredible"" new direction","I've long been a fan of Pixar's work (MONSTERS INC. being my personal favorite), and I've long been awed by their insistence on strong storytelling at the heart of their technological masterpieces.While all of the Pixar films have been great family movies, THE INCREDIBLES moves into more sophisticated, more ""adult"" territory, with themes of mid-life crisis and marital discord. It is also somewhat more violent than previous Pixar efforts, with a darker overall tone.Far from being a bad thing, I like that the studio is striking out for new creative ground. For this particular outing, they had the capable guidance of Brad Bird. A veteran of Disney, ""The Simpsons"", and the similarly dark THE IRON GIANT, Bird has brought a remarkable vision to light.And ""vision"" is the key here. The best part of this movie is its look. The retro feel here is wonderful, and created by a variety of details. The cars in particular struck me; almost all of the cars in this film were custom designed, but carried an authentic retro look. The villain's island had a wonderful James Bond kind of feel to it, in a way that James Bond movies themselves quit feeling like way back in the sixties.The whole world, in fact, looked a lot ""realer"" here than it has in any previous CGI film, though human characters apparently still need a little work; rather than make them real here the animators elected for a kind of ""Thunderbirds"" marionette feel, with a few detailed features thrown into the mix for a little texture (see Bob's eyebrows or Syndrome's hair). The retro feel actually almost seems like a further development of the robot in THE IRON GIANT.In terms of narrative, Bird's script avoids the obvious pop-culture shots that have become a cliché in this genre. SHARK TALE proves that this kind of storytelling may very well be dead (or at least seriously stale), and it's wise that they've abandoned it here. There do seem to be some VERY subtle references here, and I look forward to buying the DVD to search them out, but the ones I did pick up were all pretty subdued (like baby ""Jack-Jack"" Parr... hmmmm...).The characters themselves were all pretty good. I found the story a little more engaging than FINDING NEMO, though perhaps not quite as good as MONSTERS INC. or THE IRON GIANT. Though the fabulous visuals make up a little ground; I frequently found myself grinning at the sheer visual invention of THE INCREDIBLES. Right down to the credits at the end.This is a fun movie, and a great addition to Pixar's already-considerable portfolio. It also shows an intriguing new direction for animation in general.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
An incredible film.,"I have very few words for a nice film. Everything is very good regarding this film. The story being the best. Every character had a proper role. There is no question regarding anything that can be bad in the film. The animation is one of the best. The family struggles, the frustration of the job everything is shown nicely. It involves all that is necessary for an entertaining film.The characters at some point of time felt so lively to me that i forgot it was an animation movie.

Stretched out but overall OK,"Overall a good movie. The only problem for me is that it seems stretched out a bit.

Surpassed all my expectations.,"After the rather disappointing Monsters Inc. and Finding Nemo, my hopes were definitely not high for this outing from Brad Bird. I was wrong to think that. Boy, was I wrong!First, The Incredibles is not a comedy like Monsters and Nemo. Sure, there are comedic elements, but mainly this movie is just an extremely entertaining action movie. Which is kind of hard to take in at first since we're talking about a Disney/Pixar animation. The film has a warm and familiar feeling, which is a mixture of three things.. X-Men, James Bond and well, animation (duh!). X-Men, because the superheroes, or ""supers"", all have unique powers which resembles the tone of the X-Men. James Bond, because stylistically, The Incredibles has taken many references from the series in case of the production design and music. For example, the capsules that travel on the track around Syndrome's island are almost identical of those seen inside SPECTRE's fake volcano in You Only Live Twice. And not only that, the period is in general very much taken from the sixties, which brings back memories from the early Bond-films with Connery.The voice talents are doing a great job (Jason Lee rocks!) and this film deserves an extra thumbs-up for containing some traditional emotional moments without being melodramatic or tasteless at any point.***** / *****",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
loved this animation,"The Incredibles, a Pixar classic, is a delightful family superhero film that strikes a perfect balance between thrilling action sequences and heartwarming character dynamics. The animation's innovative quality, especially in capturing the characters' superpowers, remains a strength, while the voice acting, led by Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter, adds depth and charm. The film's catchy score complements the action, although it may not be as iconic as some other Pixar soundtracks. While the visuals were groundbreaking in their time, a few moments now show their age. With its well-crafted storyline and memorable characters, The Incredibles earns its 7/10 rating, offering an enjoyable cinematic experience for both kids and adults alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

This movie is slow and boring and with little to no laughs. One person actually fell asleep a few rows in front of me!. Its sad to say but Pixar is loosing steam, after mega blockbuster hits like Toy story 1 and 2, A bugs life and Monsters Inc. This one just lacks that magic spark that the others had.

Why the incredibles is the perfect superhero movie,"The Incredibles is aptly named for several reasons, beautiful animation, dynamic characters, original plot, and many more, I grew up with this movie and I still love it to this day, Mr incredible is a great protagonist with a great arc, syndrome is the best Pixar villain, it's also a hilarious movie.

The Incredibles is one incredible movie. Coincidence? I think NOT!,"The Incredibles came out at a time when superhero films were less common than they are in 2018. Nobody is perfect, but anybody can write a perfect sequel like Shrek 2, a perfect prequel like Monsters U, or a perfect film like this: The Incredibles, Why is The Incredibles a perfect film? Well...(giggles) there are 5 different reasons for that.(0) The animation. It's great. It's 2004. The people will look better in 2018. What else is there to say? Good animation can not save bad writing or good writing, so it's not too important. I like the early 1960s touch of the film. Moving on.(1) The characters. Each character is given a superpower that fits their personality. Brad Bird really thought about this. Mr. Incredible is the strong man of his family, Elastigirl is the mom pulled 10 different ways who needs to hold her family together, Violet is the insecure teen who needs to hide herself from strangers, Dash is the kid with a lot of energy, and Frozone is the coolest friend around. I also love the last names that they have, because they also fit their characters and the story. Frozone is Lucius Best. The family's last name is Parr because they need to be up to par with society that outlaws super powers. When they don their superhero outfits, they are no longer the Parrs. They are...the Incredibles.(2) The story. The Incredibles has a great story about Robert Parr dealing with the fact that the glory days are over and he needs to adjust to a new world where superpowers are illegal because of all the damage supers can cause, but after he gets fired from his insurance job, he gets a much better job where he can be a superhero again. The rest of the family also has their own character arcs within the story that we see as they go to the island to find Mr. Incredible. Even Jack-Jack, the baby, gets his own side story, Jack-Jack Attack.(3) The villain. This film has one of the best-executed villains yet who is not only out for revenge against the hero from his glory days, but also ties into the problem of superheroes getting outlawed, so pay attention when you watch this film because this is a spoiler-free review.(4) The superhero action. Not only are all of the fight scenes kept short and concise with less than 5 minutes, they are also well-animated.(5) The memes! The best jokes in this film's moments of dialogue-based comedic relief are some of their funniest lines. ""Coincidence? I think NOT!"" ""No capes!"" ""Where is my super-suit? We are talking about the greater good!""The Incredibles was Brad Bird's greatest masterpiece. In this film and Ratatouille, he teaches us to accept different people for what is inside and not make fun of them for it. What we do not like about them because it is different, is something that might help us. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer also taught us that. You know The Incredibles was successful because it was the #1 most-viewed film in its first 2 weeks.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
A timeless masterpiece,"This movie, about a family of undercover superheroes who are forced into action to save the world, is a masterpiece!I love the atmosphere. The movie feels like a mix of adults' and children's audiences, which really makes it a great family movie. The story itself isn't unique, but like I said, it's something with the atmosphere that sets a fantastic foundation to the experience, which makes it very engaging from start to finish. The movie has a very mysterious and dark style at a certain level that makes it kind of complex, or at least feels like it, and it has such attention to detail. The characters are amazing while they also are quite relatable, especially the family dynamics of the Parrs. Each character has their own personality and struggles, which makes us easily drawn into their story. And it's not only the story. It's also the script that makes the story quite engaging. The movie is careful with not letting the dialogues drag the scenes while it also manages to get to the point of the scenes, even with its inclusion of excellent humor. It also has some of the best action scenes in an animation movie, and they make it such a ride. The cinematography doesn't only strengthen these action scenes, but almost every element in general, and the score makes the movie even more compelling with its classic, jazz-like, agent-styled and romantic melodies. I love every element of this movie. Such a Pixar classic.With its captivating blend of humor, action, and relatable family dynamics, this movie stands as a timeless masterpiece from Pixar. The movie's mysterious and dark undertones add a layer of complexity that elevates it beyond a mere superhero story, while its engaging script and exceptional animation make it a cinematic triumph. The Parr family's struggles and triumphs resonate with audiences of all ages, making the movie a true family classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Way over-hyped, and not very funny","Pixar has seemingly regressed in its computer animation technology with this film as it had a stiff, flat, washed out, pastel look reminiscent of Toy Story many years ago. Not at all the great and vibrant colors of Finding Nemo, nor those of a competitor, Shrek 2. Maybe it was an older film just now released? (""To heck with making it great, just rake in the big bucks from the boneheads now!!!"")Anyway, the film was Hollywood animation-film formula all the way so I fell asleep, which I do in boring movies. Everything was so predictable...storyline, jokes, action, rescue, insults, ending, etc. Been there, done that many times. It was also 20 minutes overlong and dragged badly in the middle, and needed some good story editing to sharpen it up all the way through. It was very Ho-hum to me all the way and a mediocre effort at best. I generously give it a C-.It's OK for kids and those others who think all animated films are just super great, but not much for one who thinks animation and its stories should stand up well against other film types, which this one doesn't do well.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

These are brilliant characters with true to life dialogues, that are so original that it is a breath of fresh air to watch.Not any bad?

Worth watching 100%,"I don't like this as much as most do, but 'The Incredibles' is definitely a fun watch.I enjoy how the film starts out, as it introduces the characters and tells some backstories. However, once the film becomes more serious it kinda loses its edge for me. When it's less so though, it's good. The animation is very nice, even if the humans look a tad iffy especially with their expressions.Another part I don't love is the villain, Syndrome. I feel like he's a bit tame, I never once felt fear/angst from the guy at all. A much more devilish, deceptive bad guy would've been far better. I didn't even realise it's Jason Lee who voices him either, it oddly doesn't sound like Lee to me.Talking of mishearing the voice cast, am I the only one who thought it was Jodie Foster voicing Elastigirl? Violet kinda sounds like Aubrey Plaza too. I think I may need my ears tested... Elsewhere, it's cool to hear (correctly, this time) Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone.Don't get me wrong, this is certainly a film worth watching 100%. I just would've loved a greater threat to the protagonists.

Definitely Not Incredible.,"All of you do realize these movies are made for little children whose imaginations fill in all the missing ingredients, like humor, drama, adventure. This one didn't have to much of anything, but tried everything, in case you didn't notice, thats a terrible mistake, like cold mountain, its tries to hard and does too little. I seem to recall a similar film this year that received terrible reviews for having too much action and not enough character, Van Helsing was incredibly much more enjoyable, it had action, humor, enough of a story to make it worth watching, and was entertaining, this one lacked all of that and is probably the longest cartoon ever. Although it is somewhat worthy of a look, its definitely overrated by everyone, even if you didn't like it, you probably still like it too much. For a few small laughs and some fancy computer action ill give it a 2 out of a 10, ign called it the best movie of the year, thats just goes to show they know about as much as Ebert, and i know that all you true movie fans out there hate him, open your minds next time you watch a film, remember there's more to a film then eye candy, which is all this is.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

"Why is it that the genre ""Family"" is always attached to ""Animation""?","""The Incredibles"" is the animated adventure about of Mr. Incredible, a former superhero who is trying to live life normally under his secret identity. This is all happening 15 years after a series of major lawsuits against superheroes by the people they saved. After much controversy the government had decided to offer the superheroes a relocation program. However, civilian life just isn't working out for Mr. Incredible, his wife Elastigirl, there 3 ""special"" children, and former superhero Frozone. Mr. Incredible, after losing his job in a fit of rage against his annoying boss (he is an insurance claim specialist; ironical since he likes to save people), is approached by a secret employer to once again don his suit and save the world. It soon turns out though that this secret employer is none other than a deranged stalker from Mr. Incredible's past, who now wants to kill all superheroes and sell his inventions (things that make people super, e.g. rocket boots) so no one will be super. It is now up to the Incredible family (kids too) to use their powers and save the world from this maniac.Pixar has come a long way and this movie only goes to show us the progress they've made in the field of animation. Another plus this movie has is the sheer awe that we feel towards the animated action on screen. What suffers from this is that the movies relies too much on a theater's big screen and surround sound. The whole plot and almost every action sequence can be traced back to the classics. It is as if you were watching ""Star Wars"", ""James Bond"", ""Superman"", etc. over again just animated and replaced with dialogue filled with poorly timed and over-used jokes. Where these movies were fresh and groundbreaking, ""The Incredibles"" is clichéd and predictable. This should be acceptable since ""The Incredibles"" is a comedy, but the movie doesn't make fun of the clichés like ""Austin Powers"" or ""Space Balls"" do, which is the only way a comedy relying on them can survive. When you throw in the mushy morals of a Pixar feature (which were acceptable in their earlier movies but not after so much re-use), this movie becomes unbearable. It is still possible to find refuge in the wonderful plot which can still be fun despite all the hang-ups.Why it that the genre ""Family"" is always attached to ""Animation""? 6/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

"Occasionally clever, sporadically funny and TOTALLY OVER PRODUCED!","The Incredibles is one of those loud, brash, totally over-produced, lowest common denominator, ""family films' that while not void of clever asides and mild charms, results in a desperately frantic, grating and ultimately tiresome event for those of us who are not 12 years old. While the computer animation is top notch and often remarkable, the premise full of possibilities, and the musical score delightfully manic, the narrative elements are just too predictable. The characters are curiously one dimensional, which seems odd as they all have secret identities which often seem to fill irritating clichés such as the ""sassy"" misunderstood daughter, the ""groovy"" jivin' black sidekick, the ""freaky"" decidedly gay fashionista/designer, and the ""tough love"" Mom to name a few. The narrative's nearly constant action screams along, raising the stakes and inflating its self assured importance with each passing minute.This multi-million dollar, bombastic side show feels unpleasantly pre-packaged and ready to sell millions of Happy Meals, plush toys and other tie in merchandise. You can't help but wonder how many ""power meetings"" this thing generated for all the synergistic tie-in companies that cling to such shining gloss like leeches. One thing is for sure, it's designed to hit kiddie radar at dead center and this Christmas will be an Incredibles one!Ultimately, The Incredibles isn't so much a movie experience but rather an endless commercial for Pixar and Disney as the film laboriously tries to top itself with each new sequence that usually ends with in flourish of animated bangs, if not an explosion. You can't help but feel you're being forced to submit to the film's brow-beating fury. Sadly, this will probably be the most popular box office hit of the year because a lot of commercial critics will pour accolades on it as a ""feel good"" movie of epic proportions.30 years ago parents would have dutifully dropped the kids off at the kiddie matinée and save themselves the headache. Now, in the post Spielberg and Lucas filmscape that made select children's narratives high art and the national obsession with computer generated 'art', many adults will feel obliged to see and love the latest ""wonder"" from the Walt Disney company. Worse if you are not particularly interested in this kind of cinema, numerous people think you are being too hard on such films.With the Incredibles or more fitting The Incredibles (TM) there's a distinct plasticity in what so many film goers refer to now as a 'fun movie'.

When the characters are in danger, you think they are in danger. At one point, the mother, elastagirl, tells her children, ""remember the bad guys from the Saturday morning cartoons? These bad guys are not like that. These bad guys are going to try to kill you, and unless you use your powers they will.""But the filmmakers go further to develop the comic book characters. Like Spiderman, Mr. Incredible is a flawed family man. He, after being force to retire as a super hero, is unhappy in his job as an insurance adjuster, ignores his kids, disagrees with is wife about how to run things, he is a little overweight, etc. He has the frustrations of your normal suburban husband. Adding to his frustrations is his grander image of himself. He wants to help people. He wants to be the hero he was. Mrs. Incredible has also fallen into the role of being a housewife. When she suspects her husband is having an affair she cries to a friend, ""what do I do?"" The friend, who is one of best characters in the movie, says, ""Do! You are elestagirl. You remind him who you are!""The movie beyond the fun of superheroes is about family and mid-life crisis, and it handles the issues as well as any drama. This probably the most adult of Pixar's movies, and the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
A little overrated but still good,"For the record, let me just say that I still like this movie a lot but I don't think it deserves to be in the top. Its just that its not top250 material.The movie is about superheroes and all the basic hero abilities are there like superstrenght, flexibility, superspeed, force field, invisibility and shooting ice. I hoped to see a fireshooter too but not this time. But all the others are there so I'm not complaining.Why it doesn't deserve a spot in the top250 is because.. it doesn't have that X factor that makes me like this movie. But since this is in the top, I think a lot of people still like it, so its a good movie. I rated it 8/10 so that means its above average(average would be 6/7 for me).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Wonderful movie for children,"I believe that a child's movie should be a child's movie. Which means there should not be any jokes or words that the children do not understand. If I go to watch a movie with my child, I enjoy it even more when I know that there is nothing in the movie that would make my child uncomfortable. I have a 12, 7, and 5 year. I love the way that regular people can be heroes also. I have actually walked out of a movie theater once because the movie was supposed to be for children and there was cuss words in the movie. Why???? Why do people do this? Do some parents actually like watching movies with children that have cuss words? I love the movie.

great start and finish... lags in the middle,"..far too much time is spent on boring island. what makes these characters funny is the interaction with their environment, so isolating them in the middle of nowhere for half of the movie was a poor decisionseeing the characters dealing with normal life is extremely funny. every once in awhile their super powers will sneak out to great comedic effect.. the household fight and the sections at work are brill. also mr incredible has let himself go a fair bit which makes for some great scenesits a pity that the larger storyline didn't mesh with their lives a lot better, taking place locally rather than on some far away islandthe incredibles family are brilliant, and their are some good supporting characters also. although i continue to question why they need big names for dialogue in animated movies, for me it's just a distraction. when i hear samuel l jackson, i see samuel l jackson and not the character i'm supposed to be seeing on the screensome of the sound effects in this movie are very impressive, especially the 'bendy' sounds for mrs incredible (formerly elastigirl). these must have been really tricky to create, and they did a tremendous job on themthe movie thankfully picks up again toward the end, with some very funny moments.... especially the part where baby incredible's power is revealed!!if they just could have linked A and B together with a more sophisticated storyline this film could have been incredible.. but the long bit in the middle seemed a lot like filler",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Great for the kids, but better for the kid in you...","Contrary to those who claim that, if you remember the 60's, you weren't really there, ""The Incredibles"" is a wild ride back to the future as it looked during the New Frontier. The plot recalls some of the better-known thought experiments of the modern comics era -- ""The Dark Knight Returns"" or even ""Watchmen,"" where caped superheroes are seen as the problem rather than a solution to evil, and are banished to anonymity.Set in a 60's-era ambiance, ""The Incredibles"" follows Mr. Incredible through his new government-ordered existence as another ordinary guy (albeit a massively strong, hugely-muscled ordinary guy). You can feel him longing for the good old days of costumed daring-do as he strains to fit into his tiny office cubicle and his even tinier car (modeled after the Nash Metropolitan, the smallest car ever produced by Detroit -- just one of many ingenious touches by the writers and animators).As other reviewers point out, this film has a deeply old-school, retro heart -- it extols the virtues of the nuclear family without being arch or ironic; it speaks to the importance of seeking excellence in all we do, despite the puny nay-sayers who surround us these days (like the ones who torment Mr. Incredible through most of the film).Most of all, it establishes who the REAL Bad Guys are -- the nebbishes who insist on conformity to mediocre standards, the ones who don't want little Junior to get his/her ego bruised at the soccer match, the proponents of giving trophies to everyone who participates. ""The Incredibles"" dances all over their ilk, and has audiences cheering in the process.There is enough fun here for kids to enjoy, but don't let ""The Incredibles"" fool you -- this is a movie for the kid inside all of us grown-ups.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

A superhero family adventure with heart,"""The Incredibles,"" directed by Brad Bird, is a delightful animated film that combines the thrill of superhero action with the warmth of family dynamics. Produced by Pixar, the movie introduces us to the Parr family, who must hide their superpowers in a world that has banned superheroes. The family consists of Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson), Elastigirl (voiced by Holly Hunter), and their three children, each with unique abilities.The film excels in blending humor, action, and emotional depth. The animation is top-notch, showcasing Pixar's signature quality with vibrant visuals and engaging character designs. The story explores themes of identity, teamwork, and the challenges of balancing personal aspirations with family responsibilities.While ""The Incredibles"" offers plenty of excitement and laughs, some might find the plot a bit predictable and the pacing uneven at times. However, the strong voice performances, particularly from Nelson and Hunter, along with a memorable score by Michael Giacchino, elevate the experience.Overall, ""The Incredibles"" is a fun and heartwarming adventure that appeals to both kids and adults, making it a solid entry in the superhero genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
It's got something for everyone,"Generally not being a fan of Pixar animation (or most American animated films for that matter) I admit that while I watched ""The Incredibles"" with some trepidation, I was optimistic because of a couple of factors: First of all, I'm a comic book/super hero geek from way back and will see most of the films that fall into this genre. (I even endured the horrid ""Hellboy"" because of this ugly fascination) Secondly, Sarah Vowell voices the character of the Violet, the daughter, and pretty much anything that Vowell touches turns to darkly humored intellectual gold. And finally, the writer and director was Brad Bird, one of the original guys behind ""The Simpsons"", one of the greatest television shows of all time. So I asked myself, what could possibly go wrong? Thankfully, not a whole lot. From the action-packed beginning of the film where we are introduced to the majority of the characters, it is clear that this is going to be film that is going to appeal primarily to adults, with enough sight gags and silliness to keep the kids entertained throughout. Chronicling the lives of a family of superheroes, ""The Incredibles"" manages to create a plausible family story (though the family is certainly different from most). After a series of perceived screw ups, the government has cracked down on super heroes and have placed them into the witness protection program. Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible (Nelson) is now an overweight claims processor for an insurance company who is unsatisfied with his humdrum life and longs to relive his former glory. Helen Parr/Elastigirl (Hunter) is his wife, and seems to have adjusted to her suburban life nicely and enjoys taking care of the home and being a mother to her children Dash, Violet and baby Jack Jack. Sometimes at night, however, Bob has been sneaking out with his friend Lucius Best/Frozone (Jackson) to listen to police scanners and, when a crime or emergency occurs, answer the call of duty before anyone else arrives. When Bob receives a mysterious package from someone asking him to become a ""contract super hero"" and do various tasks for them, he jumps at the chance, a decision that puts himself, his family, and the world in peril.Throughout my viewing of ""The Incredibles"", I frequently found myself forgetting that the film was technically a children's film, and also that it was even animated. The animation was nearly flawless and the presentation had many elements of a celluloid, live-action film such as various camera angles, etc. One thing that most impressed me was the voice talent; being a fan of some genres of anime, I find myself only watching the show/film in the original language because the English dubs are just mind-numbingly awful. So even though this was an American-produced film, I was still wary of that aspect. Early on it became clear that there was no reason to be concerned, because all of the voice talent (particularly that of Hunter and Nelson) were truly great. As I mentioned earlier, I was very excited about Sarah Vowell's involvement, because this is not something she normally participates in. She did a good job, but it turned out to be almost distractingly strange to hear her voice in this context; normally I'm hearing her reading one of her essays on PRI's, ""This American Life"". Obviously this isn't a criticism for the film itself, however. The story was remarkably compelling and clever, and there were a couple of good laughs, though not as many as I expected. Still, I would consider this film, rather than a comedy, more of an action film with some comedic elements thrown in, so I wasn't expecting a rip-roaring laugh fest.Overall, I enjoyed ""The Incredibles"", a critique that is all the more meaningful when one realizes how little I like or tolerate films that are aimed at kids (my disturbing obsession with Disney's ""The Little Mermaid"" notwithstanding). As to whether the film deserves its current slot in the IMDb Top 100? That I'm not so sure about, particularly when I look at some of the films that are edged out when new films enter the list. But generally, ""The Incredibles"" is a decent film that was very enjoyable. 6/10 Side note: I rarely mention DVD extras in my reviews, but I kind of have to in this case. ""The Incredibles"" is really heavy on the extras, but the two that I happened to watch were wonderful, and shouldn't be missed if possible. The first is the Sarah Vowell video essay (it was absolutely hilarious and really does a good job of showing who she is) and the second was the short film that showed a scene between Jack Jack and his babysitter that was not a part of the film. The person I watched the movie with and I both agreed that it contained some better laughs than even the movie itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Great kids film, otherwise...","...skip it. And I say great kids film _not_ because the humor is aimed exclusively at kids. Like most major family films these days, they aim the humor at ""all ages"". I say kids because you will find the film very entertaining if you haven't seen a ton of movies before.But if you HAVE seen a ton of movies before, there isn't a single surprise in the whole film, and its humor and entertainment relies heavily on the element of surprise. From beginning to end, there was not a scene I didn't see coming at least twenty minutes in advance. Before the film is halfway over, you pretty much know how the rest of the film will play out if you've seen many films.Now, if the overused formulas and obvious plot developments are new to you, The Incredibles does it very well. Unfortunately for those familiar with how plots develop and why certain elements are put into place, you'll pretty much just be waiting for it to be over.And by the way, they're working on a sequel. But Pixar and Disney have parted ways, so the sequel will be Disney ONLY. So what little innovation might have existed in The Incredibles will most likely be lost in the sequel. But as with the tired formulas in the film, this should not come as a surprise that a sequel won't stand up to the original.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Surprising delight,"This movie was a surprise from start to the finish. The scenery was beautiful. In particular I loved the bad guys' enemy lare. It was a web of neat visual structures. The animation of each character was top-notch, in particular the females' faces were extremely realistic. It was fun to learn what ""powers"" each family member had, and to see them use those powers. Having a dysfunctional family, with all the family problems made the movie more realistic. It also helped you connect with the character when you saw their struggles. There are many adult overtones that make this much more than a cartoon, yet it still holds the magic for the children.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Not perfect to me, but hey, I'm weird.","When I saw Spider-Man 2 this past summer, the first thing I thought was: ""The Incredibles has it's work cut out for it if it's going to be the best movie of the year!""So now it's out, is it better than the web slinging sequel? I'd have to say not quite, but it is great, just great.It's got great action, great characters, a great story and great animation. The only things I found wrong with it were that it wasn't as funny as I hoped it would be(most reviews I've read describe it as friggin hilarious), and there wasn't quite enough action. The action that it had was simply marvelous though, and I'm just an action freak so for me to want more action doesn't suggest much of a shortage at all. The same goes for the humor, I absolutely love to laugh. I hope I end up insane when I'm old, so I can just laugh until I die.I voted a 9 for this movie, but that was opinion oriented, I recognize this movie as a 10.

From Retirment to Going back into Action by Force,"The latest masterpiece from Walt Disney and Pixar was unquestionably to say the least ""SO INCREDIBLE!!""Robert ""Bob"" Parr (Craig T. Nelson)was once known as the world greatest superhero ""MR. INCREDIBLE"" fighting evil as well as crime on a daily basis. His wife Helen Parr (Holly Hunter)was also one of the world's greatest superheros as well: ""ELASTIGIRL"". Then you have Lucius Best alias ""FROZONE"" (Samuel L. Jackson) another great superhero considered to be cool and wild. But it's not long until a string full of lawsuits forces them to give up their costumes and enter the government's superhero relocation program where they're to live normal lives among today's citizens. Now Fifteen years later, Bob and Helen are now living in the suburban neighborhood raising a family of three children: Dash, Violet and Jack-Jack Parr. Bob wants nothing more than to relive the glory days as Mr. Incredible because whenever someone's in trouble, there's nothing he or anyone can do about it. Then one day he gets a mysterious communication from a secret agent to spring back into action which he reluctantly accepts and from there it's ""Showtime!"". But when he arrives, he is shocked to discover that the whole assignment was a trap set by a nemesis from his past: his ex-biggest fan Buddy Pine (Jason Lee) who calls himself Syndrome. After Helen discovers the truth, she has no choice but to return to her former superhero life as Elastigirl and rescue her husband. Along with the super speeding Dash and the invisible yet tricky Violet, the family must come together and save the world from Syndrome if they are to stop him from becoming a hero as he plans to fake to be one just by eliminating a high tech weapon only HE can defeat. In the end, the Parr family learn that when it comes to saving the world, they can never abandon their true selves no matter what.There are so many elements this movie represents such as family, loyalty, yearning for another chance to be who you once were. But in the end, you come to cope with being who you are and who you want to be. In short, the story was excellent, the 3-D computer animation was completely awesome and the movie itself was truly, accurately INCREDIBLE!! I highly recommend it to all those who have not yet seen it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Pixar Does It Again!,"Okay, I'll admit it. I'm in my 40s as of this writing, and I am still nuts about animation! When Pixar and Disney teamed up for ""Toy Story"" in 1995, my mind was sufficiently boggled. Then came ""A Bug's Life"", ""Toy Story 2"" and ""Monsters, Inc."", and then other studios chimed in with their CG features, including ""Shrek"" and ""Ice Age"".But this film is the one we're talking about, and ""The Incredibles"" shines as yet another feather in the Pixar/Disney cap. The movie begins with an event which leads to lawsuits and government intervention, forcing all the superheroes of the world into hiding. It asks ""What if a family of supers had to lead normal lives?"" and the answer seems clear: Dad hates his boring cubicle job, Daughter would much rather be invisible, Son lashes out too much, while Mom tries desperately to keep it all together.I won't get into the plot beyond this, but I will say there are references to some of sci-fi's best in this movie. I easily spotted gags representing ""Star Trek"", ""Star Wars"", ""The X-Men"" and Disney's own ""The Black Hole"". I'm sure there are more; I guess repeat viewings are in store in order to catch them.The voice cast is top-rate (Disney almost never fails on this front), with Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, and Jason Lee leading an excellent cast. Longtime Pixar fans will also notice Wallace Shawn as Bob Parr's overbearing boss, and John Ratzenberger maintains his tradition of contributing to every Pixar film to date.The animation quality is eye-popping, too. How Pixar seems to outdo themselves repeatedly is beyond me. I was particularly impressed with one shot involving a waterfall that parted so a vessel can pass through it.Though it isn't quite as magical (or as innocent) as the ""Toy Story"" movies, ""The Incredibles"" is still first-rate entertainment for the family.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Spidey, unfortunately was made for the middle of the road (aka 15 years old) viewers, so it has neither in great supply.Second, among T.I.'s other triumphs is it's soudtrack.Truly inspired and evocative of some of the greatest soundtracks of all time ( I won't name names cause that would give it away!) yet not cliché or bombastic, whereas Spider-man uses the same Tim Burtonesque slop we've been hearingsince Gremlins!

"Interesting, full of quality, but imperfect.","Pixar is undoubtedly one of the great animation studios. I have no doubt that this film is one of the most remarkable in the life of the studio so far. However, it was not particularly noticeable in my eyes.The film is based on a very simple script around a family with superpowers, in which both parents were superheroes until it became prohibited, under national law, to be a superhero. Unjustly condemned to live a normal life, they feel bad for having to hide their powers from normal people. That, however, may change when Bob, ""Mr. Incredible"", receives an invitation to use his powers.The film is quite good, but it didn't surprise or delight me like other films did. The use of excellent CGI and visual effects and an excellently done cinematography are essential elements to make the film visually pleasant, not to say appealing, however, the film seemed too long for the story told, which, in turn, it seemed too basic and predictable, good for a younger audience, but decidedly uninteresting for adults. However, the film makes up for it with good moments of humor. The cast of voices has important and big names like Holly Hunter, Craig Nelson, Samuel L. Jackson and Jason Lee, and there is no doubt that they were all excellent and contributed a lot to make the film a true work of art.Technically, it is a Disney film, and that says everything: careful cinematography and an appealing look, excellent drawings and lines in a film that never goes in search of graphic realism. In addition to this, we have a good soundtrack, which does not bet on songs but in a certain epic and heroic sense that matches quite well with the theme of the entire film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

The voice acting was superb if the character design was a little too stylized for my taste. Jason Lee's character really brought this home. He was the perfect choice for the character, but the dragonball z look did not translate well to cgi.

As others have said, this is easily one of the best movies, period, that I've seen all year, not just the best animated film. The story and the writing really appeal to an adult sensibility, especially a well-read comic geek such as myself, while the action sequences are plentiful and appeal to the younger crowd. If anything, there may be a bit too much of the family/work life scenes for younger kids--the movie is rather slow for long stretches. But I don't count that as a negative. The insights and the message which comes through is amazingly subversive--beware of a world in which there is nothing special, where mediocrity is celebrated. You don't expect that from a Disney film. The whole domestic take on superheroes and their secret identities could have come direct from an issue of Brian Michael Bendis' Powers or Alias, though not taken to those extremes.

Brilliant,"Like many others, I get tired of those who bash an excellent film or critique stupid points. Holly Hunter takes too long to 'lose herself in her character'? - What an idiot.I purposely went to see this when it opened and I hadn't heard much about it. It is now my favorite Pixar film. I lost myself in this film and when it was over, I wanted even more. The characters were brilliant and the action was riveting.I tell many of my friends how I think the Dreamworks films are way over-rated, and this drives my point home even further. While Shrek is aping the Macarena or some lame rap song, The Incredibles are making a classic. The jokes/humor in The Incredibles will still be funny in 5, 10, 20 years, while kids and adults both will be wondering what was ever funny about Shrek.Sure, some of the humor in The Incredibles may be over your children's heads and the action may be a bit too intense - but it is rated PG, use your head.I went without my kids.Animated feature for adults made by adults. It has too many points of comic book culture to be for kids.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Kind of perfect,"The characters and the themes presented about normal human problems (midlife crisis for the ""Family Dad"", losing his youth and/or masculinity; the ""mother"" that gave up her personal life to raise the kids; the socially awkward teenager with lack of confidence; the little kid learning responsibility) is awesome.After that amazing presentation of characters, it gets into the story, about Syndrome (villain) and the other overall theme: exceptionality. This movie reaffirms that some people are just better than others (which, true I guess?), and how every effort to try to make life similar for everybody with rules, is actually bad (individualism over collectivism).All of that is great too, but the problem surges towards the end, that throws out all the nuanced characterization and matured reaction of every human. Example: Mr. Incredible has the chance to do something to try to get the job done, but it is immoral. He doesn't do it, showing that he is in fact a hero that deserves the special treatment he asks (the movie asks) for. But then later on he commits that immoral act, and while justifiable, the movie acts like nothing happened, making the earlier scene totally irrelevant, because then, our hero is good because we say it's good, not because of his entire characterization. Hard to explain without spoilers.Whatever. It's a great movie regardless.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Pixar does it again!,"This movie is hilarious, it's beautifully animated and has a lot of references to other super hero series and movies like batman and superman and Xmen. Pixar, the creators of Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo etc, has done it again, great humor, great animation and tons of jokes. This movie really is a keeper. When the movie starts, Mr. Incredible does some showing off like getting a cat out of a tree, super hero style but after a few ""minor"" incidents all goes wrong and super heroism is forbidden. All super hero's needed to retire and lead a normal life. But of course, the hero inside stays awake, waiting to come out. This movie is fun from the very first minute to the very last one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Time has not been kind to this film,"When I saw this for the first time back in 2004 I thought it was a good film with a couple of big issues. Shockingly the first is the overall design of the film is poor. The characters, locales were clearly influenced by Golden age superhero comics-Marvels' Fantastic Four being the most obvious-and the mid 60's ABC action cartoons-i.e. Birdman, Johnny Quest. Those works are 2D, cell animation and the designs are structured for that form. This film never fully adjusted the designs to 3d computer animation and it makes everything slightly off. You can clearly see this in the credits as that 2d animation works better than most of the film. Second, the film's conceptualization of superheroes is dangerously close to the ubermensch for the tykes. Bird's script is sloppy-repeatedly-with the sociological implications of his characters; the script plays out like Watchmen (the comic) filtered through Disney with the critique cut out. I cringe hard when Helen tells Violet ""it's in your blood.""Those problems were still present when I re-watched the film the other day but it was also *boring.* What was once novel and inventive now seems trope-driven and basic. The MCU and the glut of superhero films released since 2004 has zapped most of the life out this film. Add in some films that genuinely try to undermine superheroes-i.e. Brightburn-and there's little to this film worth seeing. This lacks all of the Pixar magic. It's an action flick devoid of charm or whimsey.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
That's Incredible...Sure It Must Have Been Used...But I'm Feeling Lazy!,"What could I possibly add to any discussion of The Incredibles? Its popularity is worldwide, and its critical success sewed up with an Oscar. It is an incredible movie in many ways. It has some crazy, innovative animation that will leave your jaw dropping at times. It has some humorous looks at humanity that few films explore. It is in every sense a family film when so many pretend to be just that. But is it THAT incredible? Don't get me wrong. I loved the film. I thought how clever this was and all that, but I wasn't bowled over like I had been when I saw Finding Nemo...or Shrek...or even Shrek 2 or Shark Tale. It must be me. I thought the film was very good...even excellent...but not the best. The story was just not strong enough for me nor were the characters as to give them that kind of attention. The family members...and I am not going to give a general overview of plot when so many have done so...were interesting characters but when separated had little of the specialness of other animated characters when standing alone. I guess if you wanted Dora in Nemo or the Donkey in Shrek to do a film as the focal characters - they might be able to carry a film on their narrow shoulders (or fins) if possible. Would any of these characters be able to do that? Let's face it the most interesting character was the crazy, short costume designer(an obvious and funny homage to the late, great Edith Head). I thought the villain in particular was very weak. I'm not panning the film. It is a great animated film and is very funny and so on. I just don't know if it has earned all the praise lavished on it. Anyway, I want to recommend this film as a fun film and definitely as a fun FAMILY film. Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunetr, especially Samuel Jackson as Frozone, and all the rest do a great job suiting their voices to characters and breathing life into this animated classic.

Rip-off of X-men,"Um, this was suppose to be a kid's film? Not one iota of it was a kid's film in my book. This is a truly adult movie, so no wonder it has had record sales. You could pop this movie in, and the kids will be asleep faster than the plot line can move forward. Obviously Brad Bird dreamed the Incredibles after watching X-men a thousand times. Did anyone else notice the cunning similarities? Well, watch X-men and you will see what I mean. I was waiting for the movie to be over after the first thirty minutes! I can not believe all the raving reviews I have read! They all must be written by teenagers and older adults still in love with superheros and fantasy lands, where role playing leads their life. The Incredibles is in league of its own as far as computer animation goes! The characters and settings look incredibly real.

I had to see it more than once to actually see and hear all the tiny details that I missed from the previous viewing. It's cool to see how much improvement computer animation has come in such a short period. The details of the tiniest objects are mind blowing. The powers of the super heroes in this movie aren't anything new from other superhero movies, comic books or TV shows but it was the way this movie put the superheroes into normal-everyday life that was new and interesting to see. As a result, this normal, everyday things may have made the movie drag on a little bit but I think it was necessary. If everything was just exciting and fast paced, then the excitement of seeing the climax ending would have been lost. I liked the old-fashioned, classic feel to the movie too. Having it set in the 50s-60s (maybe 70s) was cool to see. Turn up the volume and enjoy the ride!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
a short review for parents,I though this was a great animated movie for teens.... it may be a little old for young children (5&under) regarding some intense scenes.

Humor was used frequently in this movie as well as some values.The film was not boring. It was nice to see a family setting without any major profanity or crude language.

What a cool movie!,"I thought the Incredibles was brilliant! There are few films that bring out your inner child. In fact, most irritate you! However, this film is like picking up your first superhero comic. What is truly awesome is when all the factors of a big budgeted film come together to make a truly great picture. Pixar cannot seem to make a wrong move. I have not seen any of their other pictures but they are meant to be very good. When effects, acting and story come together it is actually very impressive. George Lucas take note!The voice acting in this film is very good. Craig T Nelson makes a very funny, kind of deadpan Mr Incredible. Also, Jason Lee was an interesting choice to be the baddie, Syndrome. Holly Hunter is also good as Elastigirl. They give the characters a lot of life, which is a good thing considering how flat comic book characters can be. But Brad Bird steals the show as Edna Mode. The superhero fashion designer.What is refreshing about The Incredibles is that it takes a kind of Simpsonesque humour to Superhero movies. With so many 'serious' superhero movies coming out, it is a much needed change of pace. At the heart of this movie is a very well written and clever story. The Incredibles has a solid storyline, instead of being the usual one joke wonder that afflict superhero parodies.The film cuts into the heart of suburbia and takes a look at things like boredom, mediocrity and a stifling sameness. The protests against everyone being the same. The Incredibles are superhero's! Why should they just be like everybody else? All attempts to suburbanize the Incredibles end in failure because they represent the forces of difference and uniqueness. Are not superheroes the ultimate or the most individual of individuals? The film amusingly gives us a look into the everyday lives of superhero's. Mr and Mrs Incredible get married, have kids and get a bit overweight. A very funny example of everyday superhero life is when Mr Incredible works for an insurance company. Another funny bit is when he states that he feels like the maid! Can't the world stay saved for at least 10 minutes? In these moments, that is where the inherent charm lies in the film.There are many great moments in this film. When Frozone is trying to get his suit and his wife is yelling at him. The jokes about villains monologuing. The cape story of Isadora Duncan that not even I was aware of. The domestic over finding the way to the villain. The family squabbling. There are just heaps of funny bits and it does remind you of an episode of the Simpsons.The animation is also really cool and everything has this awesome 60's retro look about it. In fact, I thought this was going to be another overrated, geeky animated superhero film. I have been very pleasantly surprised!The Incredibles is a film that appeals to all ages. With themes like non-conformity, individuality and the strength of a family when it pulls together. How can you possibly go wrong? 10 out of 10. You would have to be a real spoil sport not to like this film. ALL HAIL BRAD BIRD!!! See! Superhero movies don't have to suck!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

"As far as Computer-animation movies have been going, this one is alright.","In an imaginary world, super-heroes are real and there are apparently a lot of them with numerous types of powers. They use them for good to defend people against those who support evil, lust for destruction and have an itch for monologuing on their evil plots. But, lots of people are still unhappy with them, claiming sometimes that they didn't wanna be saved, have suffered injuries during those rescues, and so on. Super-heroes nation-wide are being sued for everything they've got. So they're put into a special government protection where their pasts are erased, identities are protected and they can live normal lives on the condition they never use their powers again. This isn't so great for Mr. Incredible (a guy whose super-power is super-strength)who misses the action, protecting the innocent and the glory. Then he gets an offer by a mysterious secretary who calls herself Mirage (which is very convenient since he's just lost his job again), but it's not all kosher as he finds out. It ends up he has to be rescued by his wife, Elllastigirl and their children, Dash (the name tells you his super-power) and Violet, who has the ability to turn invisible and project force-fields.OK, I'd have to give it about five stars.One star is for the animation. Pixar is very good at doing these animations, and this movie is no exception. Between the backgrounds, the explosions, and the characters, the animation is some of the best I've seen around.The second star is for the funny moments. Unlike some other movies of this type, some of the humor isn't mind-numbing stupidity. There are some genuine humorous moments, such as when Frozone is looking for his super-suit and he's arguing his wife to find it.The third star is for the morals. The super-heroes risk their lives to protect innocent lives. Mr. Incredible is tempted to kill Mirage to get free of the trap, but opts not to. Family is placed on a high pedestal and Mr. Incredible realizes that he shouldn't place sought-after glory of being a super hero for spending time with his family.The fourth star is for the fact that they do a pretty decent job making fun of comic-book superheroes. From Marvel to DC, no super-power is safe from them. Flight, X-ray vision, the ability to freeze things, super-speed, the list goes on and they have a lot of fun poking fun at them all, even down to fashion (""Capes will be your downfall!""). As a superhero fan, I do like that.The fifth star is because, well, it's just plain old better then the last one, Finding Nemo. Oy, was that a mind-melter.If your kids enjoy superheroes, but you don't want to expose them to the life-action violence that X-men, Spider-man and Batman bring, then this is a pretty decent substitute.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

"Wonderful, fun, smart family entertainment","While not quite up with the greatest of the Pixar films (Up, Wall-e, Nemo, etc.) This is still smart, inventive and tremendous fun, with some humanity thrown in to boot.For my money, more entertaining than any of the James Bond or superhero films of recent vintage which it spoofs (and with more exciting action besides!).In an alternate universe, Superheroes are told to stop being, well, super, because of the risk of law suits and other problems. But some just can't get the urge to fight crime out of their blood. Like Mr. Incredible. He loves being a family man (a family who also all have super powers) but a 9-5 job in an ugly, greedy corporate world is more than he can take. So he quietly slips back into the super-hero biz, and eventually drags the whole family in as well.All done with terrific animation, clever wordplay, great voice acting, and a nice comment or two about the traps of trying to be 'normal'.

That was totally wicked!,"The Incredibles is nothing short of incredible. Even though it's animated, it's one of the greatest superhero movies of all time, and it's one of my favorite movies of all time, AND it's my favorite animated movie of all time! Jeez, this movie is a record-breaker when it comes to being among the best of its kind. And the movie CERTAINLY reflects that.What's the story? In this lauded Pixar animated film, married superheroes Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl are forced to assume mundane lives as Bob and Helen Parr after all super-powered activities have been banned by the government. While Mr. Incredible loves his wife and kids, he longs to return to a life of adventure, and he gets a chance when summoned to an island to battle an out-of-control robot. Soon, Mr. Incredible is in trouble, and it's up to his family to save him.No good superhero movie is without its action, and this movie definitely doesn't disappoint. The action scenes in this movie are phenomenal, especially the final battle where the Parr family have to destroy Syndrome's mega Omnidroid. Also, the animation, while looking a bit dated by today's standards, looked amazing for its time, and today it still looks very solid. Also, the performances are great. Craig T. Nelson does a great job at playing Mr. Incredible/Bob Parr, and you can tell Mr. Incredible's feelings with his voice, something all movies should do but unfortunately don't always succeed. This film, however, definitely succeeds in that category. Holly Hunter is also very good at playing Elastigirl/Helen Parr, even if she sounds like she's wearing braces. The characters are likable and very identifiable to a lot of families with major issues, and it is very realistic to those. Also, I like how the film focuses more on the family and not the action. It's a great twist on the superhero genre I think a lot of superhero films should use, especially ones like Ant-Man and Spider-Man, which do focus on the main hero's family, but not like this.In conclusion, The Incredibles is an incredible movie under the genius mind of Brad Bird, who also made The Iron Giant, Ratatouille, Mission: Impossible- Ghost Protocol, Tomorrowland (which wasn't that great) and the sequel, Incredibles 2. Brad Bird did a great job at directing, and the movie itself holds a strong story, a great script, very nice animation, memorable characters, an awesome score, and some epic action.

Another work of Pixar magic,"Pixar has done it again! They managed to create a gem that kids and their parents can thoroughly enjoy, with neither age group getting too bored.The film is about a pair of superheroes that have given up their glory days to raise a family and be as ""normal"" as possible. Of course that's about to change when the husband receives a message calling him to complete a secret mission, which leads to a secret revival of his superhero career...While the movie was certainly enjoyable, it doesn't quite match up to its predecessors. The plot development was slow and a bit weak. I had a hard time finding a character to identify with. This wasn't the case with Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and the Toy Story films. Those movies all had solid plots and well-developed characters.In sum: while the Incredibles sports excellent animation, its poor character development and a weak plot hold it a notch lower than the earlier Pixar films. They probably didn't spend as much time perfecting the story this time around.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Expect the incredible,"This is a Disney Pixar original superhero movie directed by Brad Bird, that alone is what will get you to watch this film, and that is why I watch it, along with it just being one of Disney Pixar's most famous animated films that people still like to watch till this day since the year 2004 the year it came out; I will just give my thoughts on the film after rewatching it recently. Disney Pixar's film The Incredibles (2004) is an excellent and fun animated film with great voice acting, nice 3D animation, funny moments, and a few fast-paced action sequences; I liked that there were occasional jabs at superhero movie tropes and the family dynamic they have both when trying to be normal and when they are out being superheroes was well-done, along with the premise involving superheroes being forced into retirement because of certain incidents that occur sounding like a realistic take on superhero movies we have not seen a lot in more famous or well-known superhero films.The main Parr family includes Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible, Helen Parr/Elastigirl, Dash Parr, Violet Parr, and the youngest Jack-Jack Parr with excellent voice acting by Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Spencer Fox, and Sarah Vowell; the family dynamic with them was well-done with them being believable as a superhero family, and each one of them were entertaining in their own way. Mr. Incredible missing the glory days and wanting to go back out there by taking some job to an island was entertaining to watch, how him and Elastigirl met was interesting, having everyone use their powers is cool, and I like how hard they try to hide their powers; also, the point in time shown at the beginning of Mr. Incredibles's past was goes from something entertaining to something realistic from how the law on superheroes changed through the years. Lastly, there is Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible's friend Lucius Best/Frozone voiced great by Samuel L. Jackson who was funny and entertaining in the film, and superhero suit designer Edna Mode voiced very well by Brad Bird who was also very funny and entertaining to watch when she appears.The villain Syndrome voiced great by Jason Lee was an entertaining villain who has a good backstory that makes sense that connects to Mr. Incredible in a way from the past, with it making him interesting by having him not have superpowers but instead just uses gadgets to his advantage so he can mess with or just show Mr. Incredible that anyone can be super even without any special powers. For the year 2004 the 3D animation is great with good character designs and believable expressions or movements, nice backgrounds of the city or the island, a few fun action sequences that work well with the animation, and the animation helps with the comedy in the film; the film was funny with quite a few memorable lines of dialogue, there is a great family dynamic, jabs at superhero movie tropes that can be funny, and there are moments in the film that did feel realistic in a sense, which was interesting to see in an animated film like this.Disney Pixar's film The Incredibles (2004) is an excellent and fun animated film with great voice acting, nice 3D animation, funny moments, and a few fast-paced action sequences; I liked that there were occasional jabs at superhero movie tropes and the family dynamic they have both when trying to be normal and when they are out being superheroes was well-done, along with the premise involving superheroes being forced into retirement and the leads wanting to be heroes again is a good idea, and it works well with the great direction, the script, and the animation. I am sure everyone has seen this film before, especially for Disney Pixar fans, so I am not saying anything new about and I am just saying my own thoughts on the film; this film is worth watching for Disney Pixar fans and for those who are not big fans of superhero movies in general, because this is a fun animated film that is worth both the chance of watching and rewatching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Am I the only one who didn't like it?,"Pretty much every single person I came across was raving about ""The Incrdibles"" after seeing it. This included my Dad, who is in his early 40's.

In my opinion, there were two good things about this movie:1. Incredible CGI and special effects. Not as good as some like ""Finding Nemo"", but still incredible.2. The fact that it ended.Apart from that, I really can't think of much else nice to say about ""The Incredibles"". Elements of the storyline felt clichéd and recycled, such as the character syndrome, and the fact that The Incredibles seem suspiciously like a carefully-disguised rip-off of the old cartoon ""The Fantastic Four"".The plot itself was tired and predictable, much like the clichés. I would've let all that slide if they had at least injected some good humor into the movie, but alas! I didn't get one laugh from the whole thing.

A strong supes movie,"The unique aspect of the story lies in its portrayal of superheroes, or ""supes,"" and how they would be perceived and treated in a constantly evolving society. The incident where Mr. Incredible gets sued for saving someone stands out as a particularly realistic and thought-provoking moment, reflecting real-life situations where individuals have faced legal repercussions for their good deeds. This scenario highlights the complex relationship between superheroes and the public, emphasizing that even acts of heroism can lead to unexpected and often negative consequences. This twist in the narrative is not only a commentary on societal attitudes but also adds a layer of authenticity to the storyline.In real life, there have been instances where good Samaritans have been sued for their actions while trying to help others, which might seem absurd at first glance. However, these cases often revolve around the legal implications and responsibilities associated with intervening in emergencies.

Forced to live mundane lives as a working father, Bob Parr, aka Mr. Incredible, longs for action, and gets his chance when a mysterious message gets in his hands, only to discover that what he really needs right now is a little family cooperation when an evil new villain named Syndrome (voiced by Jason Lee), who was formerly a superhero fanatic, now a crazed baddie who wants to get his share of the superhero limelight.The rest is a ride. The animation is crisp and active, with sequences that rival anything audiences have seen on any SPIDERMAN's or SUPERMAN's out there. The voice cast is familiar but never distracting (Samuel L. Jackson's voice performance as the super-cool hero Frozone is a favorite), lending their voices to some funny and colorful characters. Director Brad Bird may have had a kid's movie in mind while making this, but he packs in enough humor and adult appeal to make it perfect entertainment for the whole bunch. It ain't the best Pixar film however, but that doesn't matter. It's entertainment nonetheless.Rating: ****1/2 out of 5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredible!,"Toys, bugs, monsters, fish. These are the great stories Pixar has told. This one is like a comic book, but it shows family, working together and saving the day. The Incredibles is no exception. In this story, the famous superhero Mr. Incredible, is always saving the day by using his superhuman strength to protect Municiberg from the dark forces of evil, with his super-stretchy wife Elastigirl and his best pal, the literally super cool Frozone, who can shoot ice and snow from his hands. But one tragic day, superheroes are not allowed to use their powers in public, because they cause too much damage to the city. The government sues and bans superheroes and forces them to retirement and puts them in the Superhero Relocation Program, which superheroes hide the powers and are deemed illegal, and have to fit in with society. 15 years later, Mr. Incredible and Elastigirl now have settled in society. They now have three kids, a daughter named Violet, who can turn invisible and project force fields, and two sons, the oldest son is a hyperactive 10 year old boy, named Dash and the youngest is a baby named Jack-Jack. Though he loves his family, Mr. Incredible has become depressed and lonely with not being able to save the day and hates working as an insurance adjuster. One day, he is called in to action by a mysterious communication, which sends him to a remote island. A spy named Mirage has given him a top secret mission to fight a savage robot called the Omnidroid. Mr. Incredible successfully defeats the robot and feels like a new man. He even has new costumes for his family, designed by his old friend, Edna Mode. During his next assignment, Mr. Incredible discovers Mirage is working for Buddy Pine, a disaffected number one fan of Mr. Incredible, whom he had rejected as a sidekick, Incrediboy. He has adopted the supervillain alias ""Syndrome"". He is intending to send his Omnidroid killing machine to Municiberg to destroy all superheroes and rule the world. And so it is up to the Incredibles to save the city and work together as a family. The Incredibles, as the name implies, is very incredible, with jazzy music from Michael Giacchino, amazing direction from Brad Bird, the voice of Edna Mode, and the story is done brilliantly by Brad. Good luck saving the world, Incredibles!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Worst Movie Ever!,"I know than a lot of people will disagree with me, but, dude! the animations are slow, characters are useless! plot its ridiculous and senceless!! Antagonists are dumb and everything in the movie its just another ash in the ashtray!!! The worst part: it won an Oscar, that Oscar Belongs to Sharktale or Shreck 2!, not to this usseless piece of crap!!!! That really pisses me off, because that price was buyed!! Buyed! I hate that movie, and i hate most of the Pixar work!!!!!!!!!!!!! >=( Never thrust the Oscars!

Incredible sound editing & animation !!!,"Its one of the top 10 animated movies with thrilling script and full of entertainment. Pixar has created another instant family classic in CGI cinema.Absolutely, Oscar award wining movie in sound editing and Best Animated Feature Film of the Year 2004.I'm not a big fan of animated movies but after watching this movie I got inspired to watch more animated movies.This film is endlessly creative and exciting, and it has the perfect balance of humour and sentiment I've seen in a long, long time. I enjoyed every minute of this movie. The action sequences, the comedy and the storyline were all very well done.I would love to watch this again. All the undercover superheroes & their powers were amazing. Won more than 50 awards and 40 plus nominations.

Brilliant; best thing to come out of Hollywood pretty much ever,"The Incredibles is the first movie I've ever seen that is based on a non-contradictory value system. There is no Cinderella story here; instead we have an animated demonstration of what Ayn Rand illustrated in Atlas Shrugged, that it is the men of ability on which the safety and advancement of mankind depend. The characters are well defined and their actions are the logical outcomes of the values they hold. Those with correct, objective values succeed, those without them, fail. There is no sympathy for evil, only admiration for the good. It absolutely astounds me that a fantastic character like Edna (the arrogant, domineering fashion designer) has somehow emerged from Hollywood's, indeed the nation's, culture of moral relativism (I speak from personal experience, being a Californian by birth, not by volition), but it happened and I only wish it would more often.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Still fast, fun, and stylish 18 years later","The Incredibles is another classic movie, and the sixth hit in a row for Pixar (yeah I'm still counting A Bug's Life as a hit. It's not as great, but it's still pretty good overall).I read this is when they felt the technology was good enough to make a movie about humans without them looking too off-putting or uncanny, and I think they pull it off. The character models are still cartoony and often non-realistically proportioned, which helps, and I did find all the hair animation impressive (when the character get wet though, not so much- that's the only area things look a little dated/plasticy).The Incredibles doesn't hit as hard emotionally as other Pixar classics, but makes up for it with the action scenes (which are still are great looking and exciting), as well as an engaging family story and a main plot about a guy going through a mid-life crisis... in a kid's movie. And it still works. That's how good Pixar were during their golden age.I like the style of the world, all the different locations, love how much the ""camera"" moves and follows the characters at high speeds, and the musical score is to die for, and fits the movie perfectly.The Incredibles isn't quite my very favourite Pixar movie but it's amongst their best. 2004 was a great year for superhero movies, considering Spider-Man 2 also came out that year, and both pre-dated the current superhero craze by a few years.Next on the Pixar rewatch list is Cars, which I'm not super excited for. Still, I haven't seen it since I was 11, when it was in cinemas, so if nothing else, it'll be interesting to see how it does (or doesn't) hold up 16 years later.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Look up in the sky!  Is it a bird?  Yes, it's indeed Brad Bird","There's something very homey/cozy about The Incredibles the way Iron Giant (also directed by Brad Bird) was. It had a certain quietness to it where jokes don't need to be happening every few seconds (which Disney tries to do a lot--which also tries to cover up the shallowness of their storytelling), because, well, the whole idea and genre is funny in itself. The whole idea of an overweight, aging superhero working in an ill-fit cubicle with that certain expression on his face speaks volumes. It's not a type of joke you get by trying to verbally explaining it to somebody. Unlike the previous Pixar film ""Finding Nemo,"" this film goes for a more minimalistic, almost 2-D in nature, more expressive and animated. It's not breath-takingly realistic (although there are moments that blew me away) as it's more stylized, cartoony. Some will complain about certain slow spots as the story builds on the characters and situations (not much unlike Iron Giant), but that's where moments of clever ideas and dialogue sets in. While I visually enjoyed ""Finding Nemo,"" I have to say some of the inventiveness of such films as Toy Story series and Incredibles wasn't as prevalent in that movie.In that sense, I found Incredibles to be much more satisfying than ""Finding Nemo"", ""Bug's Life"" and ""Monsters Inc."" It's not as up there as ""Toy Story 2"" (which I consider very very high in terms CG movies, and probably one of the best sequels ever made) but comes pretty close. I must say one of the reasons Pixar movies tend to be a step above most animations (even Shrek 2) is that beyond all the technical aspects, there's often something a little more deep, if not poignant, in the stories. Incredibles is no exception. The characters go through human struggles and obstacles that many people (even the fishes in Finding Nemo had human struggles) go through. They may not be exactly the same struggles we are familiar with, but there are certainly parallels. We may not have super-powers, but we all have certain gifts which we can maximize for good, or purpose. Many adults, who grew up with Superman, X-men, and Fantastic Four will find a lot of the powers quite familiar, and I must say I'm happy to see Ice-M..I mean, Frozone, utilize his powers in so many clever ways as well as all the other great characters. The way the film goes, it's pretty inevitable that there will most likely be a sequel, although I'm not sure if that basically means Disney, and not Pixar (which will move on from Disney), will work on the sequel (I'd love a sequel, only if Pixar does it). Overall, ""The Incredibles"" is clever, satirical, thoughtful, heart-warming, and extremely enjoyable. Among films I've seen this year, this film leaves a nice, satisfying grin in my face. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Terrific popcorn muncher,"As intellectually sweeping and philosophically cavernous as a tin thimble, THE INCREDIBLES remains the best film thus far (the latest in an astonishing series of continuous hits) to issue from the Pixar group (Disney distributed). This studio's founders are former Disney people. Whatever, they really know how to win and win again, something that Disney itself has forgotten how to do.The 3-D, CGI animated film is a fast moving trans-genre (action-adventure, comedy/parody) picture that all can enjoy at the visceral level. If fun is your thing this one is for you. It's clever, witty, brightly written and directed by Brad Bird whose credentials include The Iron Giant (1999).The only downside for me was the use of very well known live-action voices for the leads, whose real life images kept intruding and competing with the graphically rendered characters. As I said in previous comments on animated films, this is a personal irritant. For some it might not even be an issue.However, I fail to understand the need for 'known' voices.Not in the farthest reaches of my imagination would I suspect that Holly Hunter's voice, for example; though stylized, very rich and easy to discern, was a box office draw for this product. When looking at the rendered character I kept wanting to see Holly Hunter. This is as disturbing as watching a badly lip-synced foreign film. Again, it's the reason that Walt Disney chose the unknown Adriana Caselotti for the voice of Snow White (1937) as opposed to some giant box office voice of the period.It might be noted here that Disney's early films all had intellectual levels of meaning as well as the entertainment values. Both today's Disney and Pixar seem not to care about this. Yet, depth is what gives a film legs and renders it a true classic. At the bottom line, nevertheless: The Incredibles is highly recommended for the sheer, if easily forgettable, fun of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredibly entertaining!,"This is a movie that can be only described as INCREDIBLE!! Everything comes together in this movie. The family of superheroes reflects an actual family...the father is a strongman, protecting his family; the mom is elastic, being stretched in every direction to keep her family and children in check; the daughter is a shy person who shrinks and/or disappears; the son is a speed demon with energy to spare; etc., etc. They all come together to help save the world from the bad guys...just like a family should! The voice talent (Craig Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee, on and on) was incredible (it's the only adjective I can think of!)...everybody matched their character. I'll forgive an early slow stretch (only a few minutes) because the rest overwhelmed it. This movie gets a 10 only because I can't give it a higher score!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredibly Incredible,"One of the best animated feature of all time, if not the best.......The Incredibles is a story of supers, who are acclaimed for their fame and mysterious powers... But when mankind feels the days of the supers are over, they order the supers to go under cover and live with their secret identities, and stop using their super powers....Their lives becomes monotonic, and instead of their exciting jobs, they are stuck to punching papers all day and cleaning diapers.... But when these ex-supers start disappearing, one of them takes up the responsibility, to catch up with the bad guy, once and for all.... So, Mr. Incredible, and his family of Incredible super heroes, take it up to save the day........Overall, it is a pretty neat movie with a very good story, and nice script.... The animation is naturally superb, but what it stands out from rest of the animation releases this year, is the completeness....This was exactly the case with Finding Nemo, and like it, this is yet again, a movie which one can say that is a complete movie.....So, that's why it got the damn Academy Award, for animation plus the other 2....Overall 8/10.....",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
It's Incredible,"Before The Incredibles, Pixar made films like Toy Story, A Bugs Life and Monsters Inc. They've always avoided human focused storylines because of the lack of the technology. But they have got the animation down to perfection here from the facial expressions and character movements. The textures of hair and muscle movements are also a great achievement. Looking back today the animation still looks impressive.There are so many films it pays homage to but to great effect. It's more of a satire of films than a spoof. It mostly deals with comic book films like Fantastic 4 but it actually works as its own movie. It also has a 60s Bond espionage feel to it. These heroes do their work in the shadows like secret agents, our lead character is cool and charismatic and the villain lives in a Volcano. Like every Pixar film before it, it's a cleverly written film because it's not just aimed at kids. It deals with subjects like political commentary, the mundane restraints of work life and letting yourself go. It's a film about family, redemption, rejection and consequences. Some films feel forced whenever they tackle social subjects but the writers manage to balance all of these subjects that work well within the story.The action scenes are really exciting and inventive. There are so many subtle comedic moments and there are some heartfelt ones too. It takes so many risks and it's a surprise to see some of the darker scenes make it into the film. Voice actors Craig T Nelson, Brad Bird, Holly Hunter and Samuel L Jackson each give memorable performances and the exciting music score by Michael Giacchino elevates the action scenes to another level. Stan Lee once said it was the best superhero film he's ever seen, and he wasn't wrong. It puts a lot of superhero films to shame.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
You should not miss this movie,"This movie is not what the previews and hype make it appear. It is not as funny (usually) as Toy Story or some of the others. It is not as ""kid-ready"" as the others. It has a real story. I read an interview with the Pixar people where they said they did not want to keep making the same movies with different characters. They wanted each movie to be really different. This movie is that certainly.There is funny stuff in the movie but pretty soon, they do not seem like cartoon characters any more. They seem more like the comic book superheros.I am a Plaintiff's lawyer but even I found it humorous that lawsuits drove the superheroes into hiding. Sad commentary but pretty humorous. The movie is really about how those superheroes would fare, and cope with, no longer saving the day. How do their children cope with having super powers they have to hide completely? As Mr. Incredible hits mid-life, and no longer looks or feels Incredible, what does he do? It would be wrong not to mention the son (Dash), who has superspeed and the fun he has in school with it. Who among us who ever read comic books or watched cartoons did not dream of having superspeed and doing the stuff he does?I have heard people complain that the Incredibles are a lame knock-off of the Fantastic Four. Well, while it is true there are similar powers, this is really nothing like the Fantastic Four and it really does not attempt to be. If you are among those who hate the movie for this reason, you ought to find some better reason because the whole comparison to the Fantastic Four is pretty far out there.This is a movie you should feel taking your children to see. It is also one that will keep the adults' attention. This is not one of my all time favorite movies, but it was a very good movie, presented in a very interesting way and something I enjoyed seeing. As I say in many of my reviews, if you enjoy the movie, it has done its job. Don't miss this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Very well done departure,"This is a different film from previous Pixar/Disney collaborations. As with previous films, the graphics are outstanding. Much like Finding Nemo the graphics are so well done that you are not consciously aware of their provenance. Even though the cast is exclusively humans, the images are engaging without taking you out of the film. The soundtrack does an excellent job of conveying the tone of the scene. Both the images and sounds pay homage to other genres and films without name-dropping.Where the previous Pixar/Disney collaborations emphasize the youthful fun over the adult conflict, this film moves the conflict to center stage. This is a film about a man struggling to balance his metier and his obligations and a woman trying to hold her family together. The setting of this conflict amidst superheros ultimately makes this film so enjoyable. But, unlike Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and Toy Story, this film feels like a drama. (In that regard it reminds me of Bird's The Iron Giant.)In other words, rather than a kid's film that adults can enjoy, this is an adult's film that kids can enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredibly boring,"I am great fan of Pixar and I had really high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, I was completely let down. It seems to be one of those movies that do not live up to IMDb hype. The Incredibles had an amazing animation (I can certainly agree with that), but it was an extremely long and boring movie.The plot was very predictable and the humor was really bad. Maybe it was too American for a European audience, dunno. In any case, it was an endless (and I *do* mean endless) series of action animations with a few (bad) jokes in between. There were some good lines and scenes in this whole 2 hour mess, but overall it was boring and by the end I was hoping for the bad guy to kill everyone else an then destroy earth as we know it.6/10 for animation alone. If animation wasn't that good, it would easily be below 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Psychic yum yum for anyone who likes Superheroes or CGI,"This the best movie I have seen in nearly two years. It is a must for anyone who is interested in the superhero mythos in America or the evolution of computer generated images in film.This is the next generation of computer animation. It will be the benchmark by which other films are judged. The character designers used a more cartoony look, which was an advantage because they could go wild with the hair and faces. The film itself, backgrounds and action sequences are so well rendered that they are sometimes hyper 3-D, where you can see more than you would in live action film.The plot was multi-layered, if a little slow in the beginning. The movie creates almost the ultimate expression of the ""superhero in mundane life"" scenario. They also managed to express the ""american superhero"" scenario AND the more anime-esque ""child empowerment through super powers"" scenario. All and all a complicated film.

So incredible I wish it was longer.,"This is one of the best Pixar movies made yet. I remember waiting to see it in theaters when they showed the trailer of it when Finding Nemo was out.I kept counting the days for when it'll be release in the USA. On November 5th, 2004 I saw it on opening day.And it was incredible! I enjoyed every single minute of the movie.The incredibles is all about superheros. Taken place in a retro 50s vision of the future. Mr. Incredible is one of Metropolis's main superheros. He fights crime and saves the day with his super strength. Life was super right until he was sued by a suicide diver who didn't want to get saved. While other superheros are getting sued here and there. This lead to a conclusion where people don't want anymore superheros when crime seemed to decreased more than average. The super heroes now have to face the rest of their lives as their alter egos. With the government protecting their private lives.Mr. Incredible aka Bob Parr his alter ego is now settling down with a normal life with his wife Helen aka Elastagirl with a family to raise. They have a son, an infant son and a teenage daughter. They developed unique powers of their own but they were told not to use them at all or their secret will be reviewed.Bob Parr misses his hero days. He wishes he could be able to go out in public as Mr. Incredible again. And without any questions he's given an assignment by an unknown organization. Which their given him an opportunity to be a superhero again.Little does our hero know is that this organization is cooking up a crafty scheme involving all the supers.The Incredibles is an awesome movie hands down. The direction, animation, story, and plot are all great in my opion. Brad Bird who did Iron Giant, must be very proud of making this movie. I recommend it to those who liked Iron Giant or great action films.It's the first ever rated PG Pixar movie. For Action Violence and non-bloody fights. It's not gory so it should be OK for a kid to watch it. Just don't expect it to be a Family Safe Toy Story movie. Cause this is way different from Toy Story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
One of Pixar's Best,"I have an affinity for superhero movies--comic book related and non- comic book related. So, a movie with a few super-humans, even as an animation, is right up my alley. But The Incredibles went a slightly different direction. They explored a very novel concept with superheros. What if they were a liability? What if they were forced into retirement? What would a super-family be like living as normal human beings?Those are the questions The Incredibles answered and it was great. Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson) and Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) marry and have a family. Mr. Incredible struggles with being a non-super working stiff. Elastigirl is struggling to maintain the family's low profile. Both of their struggles come to a head when they are forced back into action.I liked the premise as well as the execution of it. Pixar puts out solid movies time and again and this is one of Pixar's best.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Everything to like, nothing to dislike","This is probably my favorite Pixar picture to date. The animation is top-notch, including several very high-speed action scenes. The characters are believable, and arguably developed quite well, not to mention very well-cast (particularly Gilbert Huph, played by Wallace Shawn, whose brief appearance is reminiscent of his role as The Great Vizzini in ""The Princess Bride""). There's just enough satire and predictability to both satisfy and amuse all but the most critical audience. And the humor is prevalent throughout, but never detracts from the point. All in all, I'd say it's everything you could want in a movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, and I'm sure I'll be seeing it again soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Incredible in more ways than one,"The Incredibles creates an exciting world where superheroes have been oppressed and tells the story of a family of superheroes trying to maintain a cover in suburban life. However, their cover cannot last forever and they have to act to save the world.The family dynamic in The Incredibles is brilliant. It feels real and is an accurate depiction of the busy life of an American family. It also provides the main source of humour for the movie. And following in the footsteps of Finding Nemo, it also has humour on a similar level.Also, for it being a kids' movie, I actually didn't see the plot twist coming. It made total sense and I thought it was really intriguing as a story line. Furthermore, all of the plot points are brought fully circle and make for really enjoyable watching. The scene attacking Syndrome was very well put together and the soundtrack makes it all the better.This is one of the best Pixar movies and indeed superhero movies. At the time of the realise the MCU hadn't even begun yet. Really entertaining viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Disney tried a mediocre action/adventure with ""Atlantis"", but Pixar did a perfect job with ""The Incredibles""!","The Incredibles truly is an amazing superhero action flick with the heart only Pixar manages to do. Another great effort by Brad Bird!The characters are so lovely. The mid-life crisis stricken Bob Parr and his family who try to blend into regular suburban lives after some unfortunate events get forced into action after Bob is offered an opportunity to be super again. Craig T. Nelson nails the sound of a tired middelaged father who lives through that midlife crisis while also showcasing intense emotions when someone crosses his limits. Holly Hunter makes Helen Parr/Elastigirl a perfect example of a stern mom trying to keep everything under control. Sarah Vowell does make Violet a nervous teenage girl which fits perfectly and when she bounces off the youthful Dash they become really entertaining.But my favorites were Edna Mode and Buddy Pine/Syndrome. Did you honestly know as a kid that Brad Bird himself did the voice of Edna? I didn't, but now I know and it is so cool! Edna is so funny in her Cruella De Vil-ish attitude and her exaggerated outburst of excitement and other emotions! I was laughing so hard so many times!Syndrome must without a doubt be one of the animated villains with the highest deathcount. Oh god, I just realised how many superheroes he took down to achieve his gold. Such a tragic story of a neglected boy. Jason Lee really nailed his geeky personality, but also made him incredibly manacing when he was doing terrible things.The family aspect of the movie was also handled in a mature way by having both conflicts shown and resolved through the movie's running time. More than once the writers also managed to poke some great fun at existing family tropes which I first noticed when watching the movie recently.Overall, a great superhero action flick, but made incredible with great themes of family.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
A Bit Uneven And Lacking The Usual Pixar Strong Characters,"The legacy of the Disney/Pixar film collection will always (at least to me) be its ability to completely engross/entertain children and adults alike in a single sitting. While ""The Incredibles"" will suck in the kiddies again as usually, this time the adults are left out a bit.For a basic plot summary, this movie tells the story of Mr. Incredible (Craig T. Nelson), a former superhero who is now adjusting to family life with wife Elastigirl (Holly Hunter), also a former hero. Instead of saving the world and fighting bad guys, they are now raising their three children Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Spencer Fox), and Jack-Jack the baby. When a new baddie comes into the picture, however, the ""old crew"" (plus a few new ""kids"") is needed once again.In terms of action and adventure, the ""Incredibles"" is as good as any previous Disney effort. It is full of color and spectacle and will have the kids hooked within minutes. In this aspect, it is a very successful endeavor.The ""trouble"" with this film, though, is that the characters just aren't as well-developed as other fare. For example, when you watch movies like ""Finding Nemo"" or even ""Tangled"", you really feel as if you are invested in the characters and their exploits. In ""The Incredibles"", though, the characters are just present and not quite as well-developed.Perhaps the only caveat to the above paragraph is that if you have a family, the themes for ""The Incredibles"" might hit a little close to home. Though I myself come from a large family, I do not have a family of my own, and thus have not had to go through the types of trials and humorous situations that this movie portrays.Thus, my experience with ""The Incredibles"" was an uneven one in the end. I could appreciate some of the jokes and sight gags, but I never was really able to ""buy in"" to the characters to the extent of other past Disney works.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"It was totally Incredible, Awesome and Cool","The movie was totally incredible, awesome and cool. The best character was dash with his powers. Frozone was also superb and incredible.

I like Syndrome's gadgets and his powers. When dash runs in the water, he moves like a motor boat. Jack-Jack is also superb with his powers. Frozone is too awesome with his Ice glide and Freeze Ray. The Omnidroids are the best robots. They are powers are very aggressive. The battle between Mr. Incredible and Omnidroid 8 is totally awesome. When Elastigirl, Violet and Dash are flying in a jet, that scene is totally thrilling and awesome. When, Elastigirl passes the security guards, that scene is totally incredible. When the Parr family is united they had a fight between the guards, that scene is totally cool. When, Dash and Violet are running away from a guard by forming the Incredi-Ball, that time two velocipods come to attack and this Incredi-Ball hit the velocipods and destroy them, that scene is totally awesome. When, dash runs away from the velocipods, that time the background music was totally awesome.

"Impressive visuals, good humor, light-hearted fun, but un-original story","You've got to admit it. The Incredibles is pretty incredible. It's about family of supers who seem to have somehow become super powerful by copying heroes from comics. There's Dash, who is like the Flash. Violet is basically the Invisible Woman from the Fantastic 4. Elastigirl is also like a member of the Fantastic 4, because she can stretch her limbs, just like Mr. Fantastic. Mr. Incredible, the main character, has super-strength, just like The Thing, or and average guy on Super-Steroids. Finally there's Jak-jak, who is ""supposedly"" normal. They are retired, but Mr.Incredible is called back to work. However, not everything is as it would seem....As being one of Pixar's best films, The Incredibles also manages to stay one of the best family films out there. I guess it may be a bit unoriginal, but the characters are fun and the film is ultimately entertaining. There is just some sweet element to it that makes it fun, sweet, light-hearted and humorous... just like many films are meant to be. The only real flaw is that it seems to be a rip-off of the Fantastic Four.

Excellent Superhero Movie!,"This Pixar film was created before Superhero movies became uber-popular, and it ranks up as one of the top movies of that genre, in my opinion.The movie centers around a family with super-powers, but it isn't the powers themselves which are the focus - it's the people and their relationships. The super-powers are plentiful and used in a creative and diverse fashion, but they are never feel like they are being used as a display of unrealistic Hollywood 'showy-ness' (like many special effects laden movies do). The characters use their powers in a very natural way.Beyond the superpowers, the story-line was engaging for both adults and children, never feeling slow or dragging, but neither did it neglect the character development in favor of pure action or comedy.This movie was rated PG, rather than just G, although, in my opinion, there's nothing that's scarier or more adult than might be found in, say, Disney's 'Sleeping Beauty' or several other classic children's films. Unless a child is extremely sensitive, I would expect most to find this movie perfectly wonderful. I Highly Recommend this to everyone! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredibly fun,"This is Pixar's most enjoyable film since Toy Story 2. You have it all here...fun characters, exciting action, flawless CGI! It is just a superb creation by Brad Bird and company, who should be commended.The Incredibles begins with much excitement, then there is an admittedly slow period while the characters are ""in hiding"". However, there are still some classic moments in this portion of the film, with much humor, and nice character touches.When the action switches into high gear, it is incredibly thrilling and some of the sequences will take your breath away. You'll rush back to the theater to see this again faster than ""Dash"" runs across water...just a wonderful work of Art.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredible letdown,"So slow, so boring.5 on a scale of 10. 4 is my minimum for a professionally made movie, I add a point for Elastigirl. Everything else was very predictable, mostly a filler since they had material for 20 minutes or so but tried to stretch it to full 90 minutes.Iceman totally unnecessary. A good song could have helped a little, but there was none, or was there, I don't remember.Animation is decent, but it does not save in the absence of a plot or characters. What kills the movie completely is a very slow pace. After 15 minutes of complete boredom one wants to live the theatre. It is clear that the tempo will pick up a little bit at the end of the movie, but one understands also that this will happen not sooner than after 45 minutes of nothing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
'The Incredibles' Lives Up to Its Title!,"The Incredibles follows the adventures of reluctantly retired family of superheroes who rediscover the source of their powers – in one another. Bob Farr (Mr. Incredible, voiced by Craig T. Nelson) is one of the world's top superheroes, who makes a living by fighting evil and saving lives on a daily basis. But soon, he is toppled from superhero greatness, his life stolen and his soul crushed. When a man is saved by Mr. Incredible during a suicide attempt, he turns around and sues his masked rescuer for ""Wrongful Un-Death"" - and wins! This opens a floodgate of anti-superhero lawsuits, resulting in the government being forced to place them all in the ""superhero relocation program"".Fifteen years later, Bob and his wife Helen (Elastigirl, voiced by Holly Hunter), a famous former superhero in her own right, have been forced to take on civilian identities, in a non-distinct suburban tract house, with their bundles of joy, precociousness, and teen angst. With the exception of a new baby Jack Jack with no discernible powers, the Incredibles are a family of superhero material. Son Dashiell, possesses lightning speed, while teen daughter Violet has the powers of invisibility and force-field generation.The irony is that the Farrs go out of their way to appear normal to the outside world, but they don't enjoy it. Reduced to a soul-crushingly dull job as a clock-punching insurance agent, Bob is now fighting boredom and middle age. However, Mr. Incredible still has the superhero monkey on his back and the only way for him to shake it is for him and his buddy Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson) to sneak out on ""bowling night"" and look for some crime to fight. Itching for greater action, the sidelined superhero gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secret assignment. It doesn't take too long, however, to figure out that there's something wrong. When a new super-villain named Syndrome (Jason Lee) emerges, backed by an army of thugs and a series of giant octopedal killer robots, a return to superherodom is inevitable - only this time, it's not just for Mom and Dad, but the kids can play too.What is most incredible and engaging about The Incredibles is how, well, credible it is. The action sequences are superbly staged, inventive, and exciting, especially the fights with a many-tentacled robot. It's also a very funny movie, hilarious at every level, from school-age snickers to good-natured teen snarkiness to subtle grown-up laughter. The animation is top-notch, as we have come to expect from the wizards at Pixar. The voice cast is uniformly excellent.Well, I could go on, but let's just say that everything in The Incredibles easily lives up to the title. But the highly impressive ocular feast aside, it's the well-crafted script, with genuine emotions conveyed through the characters that make such a lasting impression. Pixar blends funny visuals and amazing superhero action with strong characters and themes that a grown-up can sink their teeth into. Director Brad Bird puts his characters in real peril, keeping the stakes high and propelling The Incredibles far out of the world of ""children's movie"".In a word: it is Incredible!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"An ""incredible"" movie.","I had been looking forward to this movie since seeing a short clip/trailer of it over a year ago. Amusingly enough, that clip never was part of the movie. I took my son who was as eager to see it on opening weekend. I was seeing it again a few days later with a date.The short at the beginning was a lot of fun. The second viewing was just as fun as the first in overall entertainment, proving to me that I will own the DVD when it comes out because of the rewatchability value. A lot of great moments of humour, as well as the action you'd expect from a superhero movie. I loved the character interactions in the family dynamics, as well as the character development and growth. I walked out of the theaters thinking they needed a sequel, a series, a cartoon; anything so I could watch more of the family of superheroes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Puts Spiderman To Shame!,"I saw ""The Incredibles"" last night at a Media Screening. This movie blows away a lot of the Superhero movies I've seen recently. As a mom I would first like to say that I don't think this movie should be seen by young children. Maybe I'm a little conservative but I would put the age for viewing this movie at about 8 years old. It is extremely fast paced with a lot of peril. I was even half covering my eyes at some points. The look of the movie is simply amazing. The whole time I was watching I could see the Video Game unfold before my eyes. The dialogue was quick and very witty with a wonderful heart warming family story. And of course my favorite character is the Superhero's costume designer ""Edna"" - Brad Bird is hilarious! This is a movie I would love to see again tomorrow! Hats off to PIXAR. Hope they stay with Disney. I think they are a great team!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Not so great,"I decided to go and see that film after seeing the commercials/trailers on TV. It looked like smart fun, for grown-ups as well as kids. Since my daughter came after Christmas for a week, I thought that's a good chance to see it. It's a cartoon about a family of ex-superheroes (Dad is super-strong, Mom is flexible, like she can stretch her arms 10 metres) and their two teenage kids and a baby. Ex-superheroes because all the superheroes got sued by people that got hurt by them in the process of getting rescued, silly things like that. Well it's completely imaginable that some American lawyers would come up with such ideas, just think of the granny that sued McDonald's because the coffee was too hot - give me a break! Anyway all the super-heroes retired to live a normal live, secretly, unknown to be those ex-superheroes. But since Daddy is a bit of the body builder stereotype (all muscles no brains) he gets the family into trouble with a bad guy and they have to fight. So apart from the story, which was okay, how did the film fare? I would say it was plenty of fun for my daughter, but it's not exactly what I would call a good cartoon that is also recommendable for grown-ups. If you're curious about the films, see all the trailers you can find on-line, and then you have seen all the good stuff of the film. The rest is a bit boring and a bit too long.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Splendid!,"Okay, so let's get the bad news out of the way first. 'The Incredibles' does not touch 'Finding Nemo' in terms of greatness. The sheer beauty and ingenuity of that film is the type that comes along about once every fifty years, so perhaps it's unfair to compare. One of the key differences is that while 'Nemo' is very much a timeless tale with universal themes, 'The Incredibles' is very much of a particular time and place, that being modern America.Indeed, Pixar has surprisingly managed to create one of the most socially relevant films in a year where nearly every film released attempts to be socially relevant. 'What?' you ask. 'Isn't this a cartoon and aren't cartoons for kids?' Actually, this cartoon isn't so much for kids, at least not very young ones. Excessive violence abounds and the villainy is actually threatening in a life-or-death kind of way. There has certainly never been another animated film with Disney's name on it that was as violent or as dark as this. Besides the content, the ideas and themes of the film really suggest an adult target audience.So yeah, the kids sort of get left out here, but man, are the older folk in for a treat. At its core, 'The Incredibles' is a well-pointed satire of mainstream American life and the cultural standards that are imposed upon this nation's citizens. Within the first ten minutes, the film is depicting a man in midlife crisis and a family filled with discontent and dysfunction. As I said, this IS satire, so these problems are greatly amplified by the fact that this entire family consists of natural-born superheroes. What makes the film so poignant however, is that it not only depicts the problem, but delves deep into examining why it exists. Bob Parr sits at a cubicle all day and is forced to deny insurance claims to as many people as possible. This is what he spends his time doing, yet he is capable of not only being a truly productive member of society, but of achieving great good in the world. Hits a bit too close to home, doesn't it? In fact, the film shows each of its main characters shoved into a role of mediocrity where their real talents and potential go unused. This is bad for them, and it's bad for society as well. They are unable to give back to the world via the gifts they've been born with and they are unhappy in being forced to simply live standard lives. Indeed, 'The Incredibles' more than any other film in recent memory addresses the problem of a culture that tends to look down upon any individual talent, unless that talent involves the exploitation of someone for economic gain (see Bob's insurance job).Greatness isn't allowed in this society. In fact, it is so forbidden that superheroes are outlawed altogether, after a rash of lawsuits over collateral damages the most hilarious of which is from a man who sues over a broken leg which is incurred while he is rescued from a suicide attempt. So all superheroes are forced to live the normal, domestic lives that bore all the rest of us to tears. Of course, 'The Incredibles' isn't necessarily a dark film. In fact, once the members of this family are allowed to embrace their talents, the bonds between them rapidly flourish. So is the root of family dysfunction found in the decision to do what society seems to approve of rather than what natural talent dictates? It's an interesting question to ponder, and one which will certainly be pondered by anyone who sees this film.Outside of theme, the execution of the movie in general, is quite excellent. Pixar has an incredible knack for picking up extraordinarily well-written scripts, and this is certainly no exception. The satire never gets in the way of an exciting story (which is all the more exciting due to the depth of the characters). In fact, I would go so far as to say this is one of the better action films I've seen. The vocal talents are great all of them, so I won't bother mentioning just one or two names. And of course, the animation is absolutely first-rate. Even if someone could somehow hate everything else about this movie, he would have to admire it for the sheer brilliance of its visuals. Seriously, wow!Of course, 'The Incredibles' is not without its flaws. The latter third of the film consists entirely of the family struggling and battling super-villain Syndrome. It's not that this section is poorly done; it just seems a bit incongruous with the rest of the film, as much of the satire is lost here. Syndrome himself is a problem, due to an overall lack of originality he and his giant volcano hideout feel way too copped from about every James Bond film. While we're at it, the final battle of the Incredibles against Syndrome's giant evil robot seems to go on much longer than necessary, perhaps because we see Mr. Incredible battle the exact same robot an hour earlier.Of course, these are nit-picks in what is overwhelmingly a very funny, exciting, and even poignant film.

One of the best animated movies ever...,"This is easily one of the top five animated movies that I've ever seen (and believe me, I've seen a lot of them). First of all, I found the concept of a world where superheroes are constantly being sued and are finally put into a witness protection program, to be incredibly inspired. Add some incredible (sorry, I couldn't resist) animation as well as the vocal talents of Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Lee and Holly Hunter, and you have the formula for an extremely amazing movie. This movie had some of the best action and chase scenes that I've ever seen in a movie (animated or live action), and quite a few laughs as well. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't enjoy this movie.

"""Save the day""","A family of undercover superheroes, while trying to live the quiet suburban life, are forced into action to save the world.Pixar, once again, has presented another near-perfect film. Everything they do is just magic in a sense where you'll never be disappointed. The Incredibles, in fact, redefines animation as if it's actually real. Sometimes while I watched the movie I thought a real movie was before my eyes, and that's the magic of it. The animation is well done! Perfect I may say. The details they include are beyond amazing and it will literally steal a breath from you. The voice acting is astonishing and again it's like a real movie. Huge kudos for all of the actors! Now to the movie... The movie unfolds like a '60s James Bond flick and very jazzy music plays in the background. The film feels very retro and is very unique. Nothing can compare to Pixar animation and the Incredibles is definitely one of their biggest accomplishments. The adult themes are still lurking in the background; this film exploring family. The film is highly influenced by many pop-culture things but comes off in a new style and is surely one of my favorite animations of all time.

Beforewatching this, my favourite animations were 'Toy Stories 1 & 2' and'Spirited away', but now I will have to put this before the 2 ToyStories. I don't really understand why there are viewers whocomplaint that this film is boring and slow... I actually found it quitethe opposite. The storyline may not be the most original, but thedialogue was witty, intelligent and not too cute nor corny; theanimation was quite realistic and colourful but the best thing of allwas its ability to make the viewers sympathize with the characters.I especially like the part when they were hiding their secretidentities, living in the suburbs and trying to live like any normalfamilies...and they even had fights and disagreements like otherfamilies, it just makes them seem so 'real' and 'humane'.

It's somehow not easy to find some movies like this, entertaining, enjoyable, funny, colorful, heroic, family, animated, charismatic and incredible!
I wondered ""how can they create such a movie like that?!""

Great for the whole family,"This is an older Disney Pixar film that I recently watched again with my three year-old. I've been revisiting an abundance of children's films and decided to start reviewing them on our blog. This seemed like as good of a place as any to get started.We are first introduced to Mr. Incredible, Frozone and Elastigirl in the prime of their crime fighting days. We see them stopping muggers, saving cats from trees, stopping bank robbers and performing feats of heroism in a montage. However, trouble soon develops in the guise of lawsuits by citizens against Mr. Incredible and other superheroes for personal injury and property damage. The government tires of paying for these lawsuits and forces all the superheroes into retirement.We then see our heroes struggling to act normal in suburbia. Mr. Incredible is forced to be a drone at an insurance agency while his wife Elastigirl is a stay at home mom with three children. We witness her struggle to convince them to keep their budding super powers in check. Other than the fact that they have super powers the struggles and frustrations will be easy for every family to relate to. Eventually an overweight and out of shape Mr. incredible is offered a new assignment by a mysterious benefactor and the plot really takes off.Many of the sub characters in the film were as memorable as the main characters. I especially enjoyed the super hero costume designer Edna 'E' Mode voiced by Brad Bird. That role just really tickled my funny bone. A few other things that stood out as particularly enjoyable to my three year-old were giant monster robots, volcanoes, giant tikis and robot birds.The Pixar animation in this film is top notch as usual. I really like the heavily stylized retro style to a lot of the décor. The characters are fun and easy to relate to even with my lack of super powers (as far as you know). Most importantly both I and my three year old could enjoy the film together. There are not many worse things than having to sit through terrible children's movies.I found similarities in the film to the Fantastic Four Comics and to the Alan Moore the Watchmen graphic novel. If you like great animation, an enjoyable funny plot and believable family dynamics, I think you will enjoy this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
A terrific movie!,"I'm not very good at reviewing movies. I just wanted to say in contrast to the other reviewer, that I thought this movie was wonderful and has now become my second favorite Pixar movie behind the lovely ""Toy Story 2"". The animation is, of course, top-notch and the characterizations are absolutely wonderful. Although the voices are not universally known, they are absolutely perfect for their characters. Craig T. Nelson and Holly Hunter are superb as the father and mother of this amazing family and Brad Bird is a hoot as the superhero fashion designer Edna Mode. There are lovely little moments in this film (though I think only the adults and older children will appreciate them) and there is certainly enough action and ""fun"" gross-out moments for the kids. My husband enjoyed the movie (he normally does not like animation) and my five-year-old tolerated the movie fairly well (some of the exposition was not ""stimulating"" enough for him). Having said that, I feel that small children (say four and under) will not get much out of this movie. In fact, I would say that this film is probably the most ""adult"" of the Pixar line. There are some great points made about relationships (mother/father/children, husband/wife) that may go over the heads of small ones. All in all, a pretty terrific movie that I would not hesitate to recommend with the small reservations listed above.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The people didn't lie when saying this movie was excellent,"I just got the DVD from a friend and I have to say that I was very curious about it. Would it really be as good as people say? The answer is YES!!! Every time I see a new Pixar movie I think I've seen it all (Of course it is impossible to improve what is perfect, at least in the normal world). But somehow Pixar always manages to find something that makes the next movie even better than the previous ones. Still, I'm glad that I didn't see the movie immediately after it was released. I always prefer to let it all calm down and wait until the biggest commotion is over, because most of the time watching a movie that is praised by so many can be very disappointing. Not because it isn't any good, only because you expect the impossible.All I can say is that it was excellent. This is a parody on all super heroes like Batman, Superman, Spiderman, even James Bond. Mr. Incredible used to be a superhero, but after making a ""mistake"" by saving someone who didn't want to be saved, he and his family are forced to become ordinary citizens. Now only known by his secret identity, Bob Parr, he lives with his wife Helen (formerly known as Elastigirl) and their three children Violet, Dash, and Jack Jack. He works as an insurance claims specialist, but he's fed up with his job and his boss who's always picking on him. He even gets fired and all he wants is to be a superhero again ... but he is afraid to tell it all to his wife. Then he gets a secret message that asks him to do a job as Mr. Incredible. He tells his wife that he will have to attend a conference meeting and leaves home...What I liked so much about this movie was that it offered constant laughter, especially during the first part, where he is Bob Parr. The way he sat in his car, how he was treated by his boss... It all looked so sad, but also so incredibly comical. If you really can't laugh with this, than you probably drunk a whole bottle of vinegar or ate at least a dozen of lemons. But that's not the only thing that I liked about the movie. The story was great and of course the entire movie is visually stunning (can you expect any less). The action shots were awesome and the dialogs perfect...It's been a long time since I've had such great fun with a movie. Still I won't give it a 10/10 but a 9.5/10. Why? Well, because I'm convinced that one of the next Pixar movies will be even better and even more stunning than this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Pixar's best yet,"I was privileged to see a pre-release of The Incredibles tonight at Pixar. It would be unfair to Pixar to steal their thunder by saying anything about the story.

The lighting, the smoothness of movement, the believable (almost) physics and the incredible imagination that go into these things is astonishing. You can start to forget that it's an animation. It was non-stop, there isn't a moment when there isn't something whether it's part of the main story of just the expressions of the characters and the little visual gags. I expect I'll have to see this several times just to try and see everything that was going on.Unless you are fundamentally opposed to animation this is a must see.I can't wait for the release on November 5th, I want to see it again NOW.

Pixar's Absolute Best,"Overview:Plot: ExcellentCharacters: GreatMusic: GoodAnimation: GreatReasons to watch: You know, Pixar movies just get better and better...and so far, this is the best one...super, you might call it. The Incredibles is really ""incredible"" with a great voice cast (Craig T. Nelson, Holly Hunter, Samuel L. Jackson and heck, even director Brad Bird provides a voice), creative plot and wonderfully developed characters. It will make you laugh and move you at the same time.Basic Plot: Bob Parr (Craig T.Nelson) and his family- wife, Helen (Holly Hunter), teenage daughter Violet (Sarah Vowell) and sons Dash and Baby Jack-Jack-may seem normal at first glance, but they really are superheroes with great powers. Bob was known as Mr. Incredible in his years as a superhero and Helen was Elastigirl. their two children, Violet and Dash, also have superpowers: Violet can become invisible at will and Dash can run faster than any normal child. They are in hiding because supers have been accused of hurting people more than helping them. Bob,however, pines for the glory days and would give anything to relive them. When he gets an invitation for a new job after being fired from his old one, Insuracare (His insuracare boss is voiced by Wallace Shawn), by a mysterious woman named Mirage, he feels as if his glory life has been regained, but soon, he learns it's all a ruse to trap him. The villain: Syndrome (Jason Lee of My Name is Earl).

"incredibly great graphics, hilarious and exciting! a must watch!","so, the movie has just been screened for a week here, and i went to catch this movie last week.. to comment on it, i must say that this movie is just the best i've ever seen..obviously, brad bird has done such a great job as both the director and writer for this story. i've watched 'the iron giant', a previous movie done by brad bird and he got it well done, too. i also believe that pixar, as a great Disney animation studio has somehow helped mr. bird to even make this movie more realistic.. gosh i really like the part where dash is trying to run away by syndrome's 'guards'.. he was so fast it was just awesome.. the movie is excitingly hilarious, too.. it's totally suitable to be watched by any age groups.. i really recommend those who read this comment to go watch this movie you'd be so satisfied once you leave the cinema.. remember, this movie is a MUST-WATCH! i rate the movie as BEST OF 2004 ... *peace*",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Yes , I liked this film","Story ""Supers""—humans gifted with superpowers—were once seen as heroes, but collateral damage from their various good deeds led the government to create a ""Supers Relocation Program"", forcing the Supers to fit in among the civilians and not use their superpowers. Bob and Helen Parr, who are Supers, have married and now have three children, Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack, in the suburbs of Metroville. Violet and Dash have innate superpowers, but the toddler Jack-Jack has yet to show any. Bob, stuck in a white-collar job at an insurance agency, reminisces of his former days as Mr. Incredible, and sneaks out on Wednesday nights with his Super friend, Lucius Best (a.k.a. Frozone), to fight street crime. Characters:  Craig T. Nelson as Bob Parr/Mr. Incredible, the patriarch of the Parr family, possessing super-strength.  Holly Hunter as Helen Parr/Elastigirl, Bob's wife, able to stretch her body like rubber.  Spencer Fox as Dashiell Robert ""Dash"" Parr/The Dash, the Parrs' 4th-grader son, gifted with super-speed.  Sarah Vowell as Violet Parr, the Parrs' middle-schooler daughter, who possesses the ability to turn invisible and create a force shield around herself or other people.  Eli Fucile and Maeve Andrews as Jack-Jack Parr, Bob and Helen's infant son, who initially shows no powers but near the end of the film reveals himself to have an enormous range of abilities including shape-shifting, teleporting, laser vision, self-immolation, flight, etc.  Jason Lee as Buddy Pine/Syndrome, who has no super powers of his own but uses advanced technology to give himself equivalent abilities.  Samuel L. Jackson as Lucius Best/Frozone, Bob's close friend, who has the ability to form ice from himself and from the humidity in the air.  Elizabeth Peña as Mirage, Syndrome's agent who lures Supers to the island.  Brad Bird as Edna Mode, fashion designer for the Supers.  Bud Luckey as Rick Dicker, the government agent overseeing the Relocation Program.  Wallace Shawn as Gilbert Huph, Bob's boss at his white-collar job.  John Ratzenberger as The Underminer, a new villain who appears at the end of the film.  Dominique Louis as Bomb Voyage, a villain from the past who uses Buddy's interference in Mr. Incredible's heroism to escape.  Bret Parker as Kari McKeen, the babysitter.

Incredible!,"I saw this movie in theaters, and it was a truly awesome experience. It showed just how much can be done with computers. The characters were three-dimensional, (in more than one sense!), and blurred the line between pixels with voices, and real people. The world that the characters live in is lush and colorful, with green grass and blue sky's, sprawling cityscapes, and tropic paradises.The basic story revolves around Bob and Helen Parr, an average American family, living in middle-American suburbia with a teenage daughter and hyperactive son. Bob has a dull job at Insuricare, and longs for some excitement in his average life.All is not how it seems, however. Around 20 years ago, Bob was known as Mr. Incredible, and protected Metroville from crime. He weds fellow crime-fighter Elastigirl, and flash forward a few law suits against numerous other 'supers', and we're back where we started.An excellent achievement in cinema, one, if not the best film of the year.

His wife Helen (Holly Hunter), formerly known as Elastigirl, adapts to life away from the crime-fighting arena much better than Bob as she focuses on raising their three children (2 with noticeable ""special powers"" they have to learn to control in public).

The Incredibles — An animation movie about a family of super heroes and their trouble,"The Incredibles is the kind of animation you can't stop watching.For one, the number of details is incredible and the attention to them, phenomenal.

Pixar hadn't yet found a solution to that problem. The dialogs and the scenes will capture the attention of everyone since you can have fun with the slap stick stuff and the action, or see the problems the couple has as well as each individuals. Many parents will recognize recurring household frictions and dynamics.The scenario is rich in adventure, super heroes, and some villains.

Headline: PIXAR SAVES Disney AGAIN!,"You've read everyone else's comments, so these will be brief.This production is as close to faultless as they get. But, if one wishes to go over the top with praise, it is for the 2-DVD set.

Choice of vocal talents: 10/10. Storyline: 10/10. The reason it gets, from me, a 9/10 is due to the (apparently) problematic conversion to CGI that Pixar has in relation to their characters' faces. There are still too many similarities to 'human' faces as portrayed in ""Toy Story"". Indeed, at one point in the movie, I was drawing facial comparisons with those in same.

I was however intrigued by the success of the 'Incredibles', rented the DVD and I am not sorry. It's pure entertainment, no pretensions, but still as good entertainment as many of the comics-inspired films I saw lately. Of course the imagination and creativity of the animators is key in such movies. Computer enhanced techniques help tremendously in creating a few characters that are better than similar cast in actor movies.

Midnight showings are well worth it.,"I am such a big fan of Jason Lee when I found out he was in a cartoon I went nuts. That and in the months leading up to the film I heard nothing about his role until nearly a week or two before the actual release. I was extremely pleased to find out that he was the villain as his role in Dogma was awesome but combined with his sarcastic nature like that seen in Mallrats purely describes who Syndrome (Lee's Character) is. Now the movie of course was based around this family of superheros and forced to retire do to lawsuits from people not wanting to be saved. I nice spoof on today's culture and for a Disney film the amount of death and off the wall humor presented in the film is a shock. I guess pixar takes it's own approach to family entertainment but I guess you can't prove these people ""DID"" die. But you crash something and it goes boom your general consensus is... He's toast!.

Why this movie is fun...,"Is it the fact that it has an excellent Bond-esque soundtrack? No. Is it the fact that the action is non stop? No. Is it the fact that it has such a neat story and such lifelike characters that you hardly gawk at the pretty pictures and think to yourself ""Wow, neat computer graphics!""? No. Is it the countless homages and allusions within the movie? No. Well what is it?To me its the fact the people at Pixar do something special. Other movie companies (especially Disney) seem to go out and ask people what they find funny. They seem to do surveys on laughs, clocking competitors movies for laughs per minute, and then average it out - trying to find some common denominator in 'funny' and generally doing 'humor by committee' - and consequently totally missing the point about what makes people laugh.Humor is the unexpected. The extraordinary that wrenches our brain into surprising directions. Pixar people seem to just put in there what makes themselves laugh - without worrying if it is politically incorrect or unsuitable for the target audience. If it fits the mood it's stuck in. Maybe they will not reach such a wide audience (PG rating) but they surely create classics that way which will have a big payoff in the long run. Somehow this total identification of the makers with the humor is transferred to the effort put into animating the characters - giving them just the right kind of attitude and mimics because the people that animate them know exactly how the characters are thinking. They seem to have as much fun making the movie as we have watching it.The result is the difference between a factory made pie and one made by grandma. Both may contain the same ingredients and be made by the same method, but one is made with love and one is made by machines - it shows in the detail, and registers with the audience.Thank you Pixar for -yet again- an excellent movie that lets me forget all the mediocre garbage from your competitors I have watched the past year.My rating: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Pixar,"As an animator of this film i would like to comment on some of the negative responses been made.I am aware everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but The Incredibles was made purely for an action purpose, we ditched the moral side of previous Pixar stories alongside the flurry montage sequences and concentrated on the WOW factor, i.e. explosions, villains etc... This film was designed to fit a specific era, with characters, scenes and plots. 1950's era to be exact. This was to be appealing to both adults as well as children.The Plot. What strong, flowing, plots do you see in most action movies? To be quite honest, if there is one, the audience tend to drift away from the moral of an action movie along with the plot due to the visually stimulating images and flashing/strobing sequences of guns and explosions. The plot was made thin to fit a criteria/genre. You guessed it, ACTION!Being mainly a children's animation production company, Pixar unfortunately have to omit some of the blood and guts that otherwise may be installed. For goodness sakes, we don't want the children to fear the action, we want them to enjoy it.As for the plot. Family, sticking together, a famous plot that drives most of Pixars films. A trademark of our company, and the plot is established and constructed throughout the slower half(beginning) of the picture, building up action nearer to the end.What everyone seems to misunderstand is that companies and films need to vary with each picture. They need to complete a broad spectrum of films, not to just concentrate on the same genre all the time.Anymore Questions i'd be happy to answer",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Incredible.,"Mr. Incredible is a superhero that got sued by dozens of people after causing havoc in a city. He and his Newly-wed wife Elastigirl are forced to make their secret identities their only identity. 3 years later, they are now settled in a new home with 3 children, all of which have superpowers. Violet can turn invisible and make forcefields (or shields. Whatever). Dash can run very, very fast. But their not so sure about their baby yet. Mr. Incredible is umber-strong and can lift huge trucks or just about anything. Elastigirl can stretch far and wide. All of which make for a unique and interesting family.Brad Bird, the writer and director of another favorite, The Iron Giant, also writes and directs the film. While I was quite surprised that the usual Pixar team wasn't writing the film (hell, throw in Joss Whedon too), Brad Bird was able to handle the film pretty well and knows his stuff. The movie doesn't have any cheesy, ""I love you family,"" type of speeches that becomes quite awkward for the audience to watch and doesn't leave any eyes rolling. Bird knows how to handle each scene and doesn't chicken out on anything.While the first hour or so isn't as funny and gets uninteresting in some parts, the rest of the film makes up for it. The animation is amazing. I was quite unsure how Pixar would be able to handle an animated film with human beings as their characters, but there's no need to worry. The design of the characters are flawless. The jungle and underwater scenes are handled very carefully and the result is magnificent. Dash running around in the island and the jet explosion was one of the most impressive things I've seen this year.All of the character's powers are shown in outstanding detail but never becomes forced or feel that the creators showing off their visuals. And while his powers are only shown at the climax of the film, Frozone sliding at his ice thingy is outstanding. Same goes for Elastigirl, who we once see jumping around buildings. All of the action scenes are very, very impressive. The jet exploding, those circle blade thingys chasing Dash and blowing up and the ending are astounding. And the lack of action in the beginning doesn't become a problem at all.Brad Bird never forgets the characters and excellently develops all of them. Instead of going with the action and developing characters along the way, the big trouble doesn't even start until the audience knows each character well enough to care about them. None of them are left behind and gets to do at least something important. All of the voice work are excellent and makes the characters believable and often times hilarious. But still, Ellen DeGeneres as Dory is tough to beat.The Incredibles is quite different from all the other soon-to-be-classic-films that Pixar made. It has a different feel that I can't really explain. It doesn't have many kiddy moments and was shot in 2.35:1 aspect ratio (besides the usual 1.85:1 flat). It's more mature than all the others and the villains actually get killed in explosions etc. It's not as funny as the Toy Story movies or Finding Nemo, but The Incredibles is just as great and sits comfortably among them, just waiting to be a classic. One of the year's best and most impressive films.9.0",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Incredible!,"Pixar's The Incredibles is the best animated feature I have seen in a long time. Sure, Shrek and Finding Nemo were good. But since Toy Story, no animated film has been as captivating, witty and beautiful to behold as The Incredibles.A lovable ensemble cast (something that often lacks in animated films) supports a strong, compelling storyline about one superhero's (Mr. Incredible) midlife crisis in light of an era of petty law suits that has driven all superheroes (a.k.a ""The Supers"") into hiding. Although all superheroes have weaknesses that their archenemies exploit, subjecting the Supers to the constraints of the legal system puts a refreshing spin on the genre. In combination with aspects of the spy genre, The Incredibles packs a powerful punch, offering an animated movie that may be even more entertaining to adults than the primary target audience.The characters are well-developed throughout the story, as they showcase their superabilities in unique and unexpected ways. Though the cast works well together as an ensemble, Holly Hunter grabs a bit more of the limelight as superheroine (and supermom) Elastigirl. Her performance is witty, empathetic, caring and sexy all at once. Also among the best performances is director Brad Bird as the voice of Edna the superhero seamstress - a funny, energetic cameo. Samuel L. Jackson's character, Frozone, is a brilliant combination of the Silver Surfer, Mr. Freeze and Spiderman, but gets unfortunately little screen time. Jason Lee is perfectly annoying as the ability-less, but scientifically adept Syndrome. The animators both did an excellent job in creating unique personalities and physical features for all of the characters, which only adds to the fluid wittiness of the writing.One of the most popular, but difficult, things to do in animated films is referencing other films or pop culture through visuals and dialogue without either: 1. dating the film or 2. relying on them for the majority of the humor. Pixar seamlessly integrates hints of Star Wars, James Bond, and Mission:Impossible, to name a few, into The Incredibles. The references are just enough so a typical (adult) moviegoer understands that there is a glimpse of something they've seen before, but only the most versed fans will know exactly where they come from. By incorporating these kinds of tidbits indirectly through the settings, minor plot elements and music, Pixar succeeds in creating a timeless cast and story - the mark of truly great film-making.Possibly the most perfectly executed aspect of The Incredibles was the score. Plays off of Mission:Impossible and Bond themes of yore lays a perfect groundwork for the film. The music compliments the on screen action perfectly by adding the ""spy"" spin to the Superhero storyline.Without a doubt Pixar's best work to date, and one of the most enjoyable movie-going experiences of the year: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Suck on that 007,"I'll be the first one to admit that The Incredibles has a rather weak core story. It's a simple, familiar and easily conceivable good guy vs. bad guy routine and the basic plot becomes apparent very early into the film. This despite the fact that the actual bad guy is not exposed an until about an hour into the film. Now this set-up might work for 6-10 year old's, but it certainly doesn't work for the average adult watching this film. Despite falling into the latter category myself (being 23 years young) I neither found this simple core story annoying nor did I feel that it took anything away from the fun that became and is The Incredibles. Fact is, that the the great characters, the familiar situations, the great visuals and music all add up to make the simple set-up fade away into oblivion.I was particularly impressed by the apparent ease in which Brad Bird fused superhero and espionage elements with everyday situations every person knows so well. Especially family themes as upbringing and aging were addressed very truthfully and at times I felt myself chuckle, because it all seemed so familiar (either from own experience, or because I know people like that). These familiar situations along with the careful build-up of the story, are crucial for this film, because they allow it to last 2 hours without becoming boring and slow.While The Incredibles may be very predictable at times, I still felt that the whole was very original. One example of this originality is the fact that everybody's super powers became useful (specifically and individually) in the end. In my mind, it is simply amazing what Brad Bird accomplished with this film and in my humble opinion The Incredibles is the best Bond film since Goldeneye (1995). But not only that, it is also the best Pixar film since Toy Story 2 or maybe ever (beating the (for me) disappointing, yet highly successful Finding Nemo with incredible ease), Disney's best animated feature probably since Hercules AND one of the best films of 2004. The film might not be as comical and hilarious as Disney's previous offerings, but it still is one of the best films the company has brought forward and it definitely deserves to win the Oscar for best animated feature. I for one CANNOT wait for the sequel, although I hope in the end they'll do better than what they ended with.8,25 out of 10post scriptum: maybe I suck as a movie critic and I should stop writing reviews, but I enjoy it too much and luckily you're not forced to read this.

A Heartfelt Superhero Film that Hits the Emotional Bullseye,"The Incredibles is a superhero film that deftly balances action, comedy, and heart. Directed by Brad Bird, the movie tells the story of the Parr family, a group of superheroes who are forced to live a quiet suburban life after superpowers are outlawed. The film is a perfect blend of stunning animation, thrilling action sequences, and relatable characters that leave a lasting impression.One of the standout moments in The Incredibles is when Mr. Incredible (voiced by Craig T. Nelson) tells his wife, Elastigirl (voiced by Holly Hunter), ""I'm not strong enough."" This line comes at a pivotal moment in the movie when Mr. Incredible is faced with a seemingly insurmountable challenge. It's a moment that speaks to the film's themes of family, sacrifice, and the limits of our own abilities.The animation in The Incredibles is nothing short of breathtaking. The film's colorful and vibrant world is filled with incredible attention to detail, from the design of the characters to the intricate backgrounds. The action sequences are some of the best in any superhero film, with each character's unique powers on full display.But what really sets The Incredibles apart from other superhero films is its heart. The Parr family is a group of flawed and relatable characters who struggle with everyday issues just like the rest of us. Their struggles to balance their superhero personas with their family responsibilities are universal and make the film feel grounded in reality. The dynamic between the characters is incredibly engaging, and it's impossible not to become invested in their journey.Overall, The Incredibles is a superhero film that truly lives up to its name. With stunning animation, thrilling action sequences, and relatable characters, it's a movie that both adults and children can enjoy. The ""I'm not strong enough"" line is just one example of the film's emotional depth and is sure to resonate with audiences of all ages. I would give The Incredibles a 9/10 rating and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a superhero film with heart.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

Some of you may remember Spielberg's ""Animaniacs"" produced by Warner Brothers. Now that was some great cartoon comedy that satisfied children and adults!

It has jokes and jabs that people can enjoy watching. The Incredibles has surpassed all my expectations coming into the film and then jumbled them all up in a blender and made this opinion for me. The character voices were fantastic. Holly Hunter was perfect and Craig T. Nelson couldn't have done a better job. The fact that Brad Bird (the director) thought of the idea that people would sue super heros for helping them out is pure genius. Jason Lee stands out as the evil super hero in this film. Samuel L.

To this day it still feels like the best animated movie.This movie never gets old and always makes me happy.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
FABULOUS,"This isn't your typical Pixar movie. Unlike other Pixar films, this movie seems a little more grown up in that it plays out just like a live action movie. These characters are great. The writers are able to portray how this family has to struggle to ""fix in"" in the ""normal"" world around them and hide their ""gifts"". The story is well played out, though it does lag in parts, that doesn't last very long and although a few scenes may be too intense for younger child, they play out quickly. The animation is so realistic that you won't believe your eyes. Pixar just keeps getting better and better. They keep raising the standard of animated features. The supporting case of characters are also wonderful especially Edna E Mode, she provides the laughs. Too bad Frozone (Jackson's character) didn't have more to do. Jack Jack is probably my favorite. I would go see this movie again and again. Can't wait for part II.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Awesome!,"Was The Incredibles ""totally wicked""? After watching this incredulous movie, the time has come for a film review. The Incredibles is an action/superhero film, where a family of ex-superhero rejects embark on a mission to rescue their city. Personally I see this film as ""okay"". The reason is that it was rated a PG and included scenes of kissing over a long period of time, making oneself ask if that was really necessary. Any Disney movie should abstain from having one too many love scenes that are over the top. If they wanted to show romance between characters, they could have presented in a more child-friendly way, such as a hug or peck on the cheek. The Incredibles is one of those superhero films that break conventions. An example is the Mr Incredible's biggest fan now is his worst enemy. Not many movies have this particular type of convention, not that I can think of. Another convention is when the superheroes of the planet get sued because of their actions to save the world. The public thought that superheroes weren't needed anymore, so they hid. Can you think of another film like this? I think not. They are many morals in this story, such as trust, loyalty, hope and most of all, friendship. The Incredibles really capture these, by ways of comedy and tragedy. One example is when they have a major domestic argument and they actually talk about trusting each other etc. etc. So in conclusion, whether I liked the film or not is the question. I mean they had some sad moments, funny moments and moments I where I felt this film wasn't actually animated and moments where I thought ""Thank God it's only animated!""! Surprisingly this movie won 2 Oscars, 59 wins and nominations! So that is the reason why I will give this film a... 87.55%",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
2nd favorite movie OAT,"An animated masterpiece, dark and not really the Disney type but I realize that's what makes it so good, the action my type with a good amount of violence, a great villain my favorite Disney villain actually and a great plot. Overall 9.2/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
Gets better every time I see it...,"Which is good because to be honest, I didn't like this movie at all when I first saw it in the theater. My first reaction was ""that was it?"" But after I watched it a second and third and... well lets just say I watched it a lot, I realized that this movie IS Incredible. Its the details that really wow you.The animation is unparalleled and the character design is creative and individualized. Each person in the movie has their own look, feeling and personality. This is a worthwhile film for both children and adults, and not just parents either. Any adult could watch this movie and be entertained. The humor is broad enough for the younger ages and refined enough for the grown ups.I definitely recommend this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
"Funny lines, great animation, breathtaking action...excellent film","Hollywood has again shown that their best product tends to be of the animation variety. Pixar has again shown they make the best of the best cartoon movies have to offer.After too many lawsuits for injuries sustained during rescues, the government creates a superhero protection program and the best heroes are sent into hiding. Of them is Mr. Incredible, who longs for the old days. At home, he feels unfulfilled with the family lifewife (Elastigirl, wonderfully voiced by Holly Hunter and able to stretch and bend to unbelievable lengths; daughter Violet, who has her own powers (invisibility and force-field creation) and looks eerily like Samara, the villain of ""The Ring""; son Dash, whose power is the ability to run at super-speeds and resents not being able to show them off; and baby Jack-Jack, who seems to have no powersyet!) He gets his chance to relive the glory days through a top-secret experiment on a tropical island, which he soon discovers is a front for the villain. Looking like the Heat Miser from ""The Year Without a Santa Claus,"" our bad guy is trying to eliminate all the superheroes and become a self-made one; his plot is to use his robotic creations to fool the people of the world into thinking they are under attack and he is there to rescue them.This all makes for an entertaining story line in itself and the way director Brad Bird presents it is wonderfully exciting. Adding to the mix are the wonderful lines of the characters. They are funny, sarcastic and very well written. If only most comedies were half as funny as this movie is. I laughed more at this movie than I did any other released in 2004.The animation, with its retro-futuristic rendering of 1960's designs, is amazing. The people at Pixar continue to amaze and impress. Rarely do they misstep and this is no exception.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
An Honest Review,"I sort of watched them out of order. I wasn't really privy to the existence of The Incredibles until my fiance wanted to rent the sequel...and then I went back and watched the first one.I have to say that I liked 2 more, but only because it looked like a period pop art piece and the first one you really didn't get that feel. It was clearly set in the early 60s, but you didn't get that whole esthetic as much as you did in the sequel and that was the biggest draw I had to it.That being said, it was't bad.Sociopolitically I liked the line about when everyone has super powers no one does. It registered loudly to someone that works in history. So the plot, on that basis, was compelling.And I am sure that if I had seen them in order I'd like it just as much.The sequel, the main draw that sucked me in was the look of the film. Here it was the quasi-family struggles which, again, seemed to be highlighted a little better in the second film. Still, it was there enough, the work-life balance to draw you in, and the absurdity that the work was being a hero was entertaining.As was the reason they had to go underground which, again, was done a little better than when the MCU tried it...but still not elaborated on enough to make it as interesting as it could have once been.In any case, it's still an entertaining cartoon. And you can see where the creators took what worked in the first one and elaborated on the concepts until they popped.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
The best Pixar movie so far!!,"I will admit, I didn't want to see this movie when I saw the trailers. The fat guy trying to put on a belt and spending the entire trailer messing up his office? Looked like a really stupid movie.But then I saw it and... WOW!! This remains to be my all time favorite Disney/Pixar movie to date, outstripping the Toy Story movies and even my previous favorite, Monsters Inc. And yes, even Finding Nemo. Everything is perfect, it's clean yet mature, it isn't watered down at all. It keeps you entertained but not overwhelmed. While I don't recommend this to young kids, I recommend this really awesome movie to anyone else! Seriously, if you've got your head in the sand and haven't had a chance to see this, go rent it or pick it up at a store or borrow it from a friend, whatever, just see this movie!! It is worth every second!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"

An Incredible Movie,"Disney and Pixar have now worn with The Incredibles. knowing that a family has inherited his super powers saving the planet from evil villains, and solving the family ties they have and their super powers. 15 years before Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) was a superhero that to all but alone, retired after legal problems and revoking the super, to disappoint a fan that was (incrediboy) now (syndrome) so that WILL case Helen Parr (Elastigirl) and forge a family. After 15 years Bob has again been super hero after a statement of a woman who in a dangerous mission to an island reported missing with the mission to solve the mystery disappearance of a defense attorney of superheroes, so Helen and children (Violet and Dash) travel with it to look, and Jack Jack knows caregiver, although the latter one whole movie scene turned out also with super heroes, avoiding robot threat that would end the world.

"""Incredible""","Casting: Obviously, the characters are great, they do a good job at acting... But, more than that, the voices are just fine and you couldn't really have found better for it... So, good job real actors, the intentions and motivations of the characters were well understood!Summary: The Incredibles, story about how some superheros became ""Nobodies"" and how a little guy who was a nobody became a (fake) superhero... Main story is Mister Incredible going to fight against a old lil' not-so-buddy of him and all the other ""Incredible SuperHeroes"" helping him for an extraordinary movie...The Movie: Full of Adventure, even some suspense... A really great animated movie, far from what I expected... It is actually rare that the previews don't show the best of the movie... It's weird, but even if it's animated, you're fixing the screen, and you can't let it go... I bet you couldn't only watch 30min of the movie!Conclusion: A really great movie for the whole family, since it also contains little some ""hints"" for adults and it shows a side of an ordinary but not so ordinary family after all! Excellent movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Animation"
