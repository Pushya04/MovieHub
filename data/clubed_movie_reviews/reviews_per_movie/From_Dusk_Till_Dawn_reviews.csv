So tacky it's good...,"I have to say that this is actually a good movie although it does lose it's way towards the end. The final 15 minutes I thought were a little crappy. I prefer more realism in my vampires but having said that, I cannot fault Tarantino, his is perfect in the role as the twisted Richard Gecko, and although I don't usually like George Clooney he was surprisingly cool as Seth. There are some funny moments that you have to have a slightly twisted humour to appreciate (which I do!) and as long as you don't take it too seriously, it is an entertaining movie. If you like overacting, lots and lots of blood and Tarantino movies then go see.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
The 1st half was Tarantino and 2nd half was Rodriguez.,"When the movie started, I was sold to a crime movie. The intro was the perfect setup for a Tarantino film. Two criminal brothers on the run trying to get to Mexico. Simple and brilliant.The movie introduced two hot-headed brothers, so you know crap was gonna hit the fan and duels were gonna go down. It had everything I wanted: black comedy, crime, suspense, drama, thriller, even Salma Hayek.At that point, everything was perfect... but then, the vampires appeared and the whole film had a 180 degree turn. It just didn't fit with the rest of the movie.I'm not gonna lie, the different ways of how they killed the vampires were pretty cool and creative, but I felt like the first half of the movie was made by Tarantino and the second half was made by Rodriguez.This movie had a lot of potential if it stuck with the first plot. I would've rated higher if they would've continued Gecko Brothers' adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
An action-packed extravaganza!!,"From Dusk Till Dawn is simply a fun movie. Not meant to be taken seriously at all. If you're looking for a movie to sit back and enjoy for brainless entertainment, get this. There is nothing wrong with the acting, the music really good and the special effects are gross (but great).The first half of the story revolves around the Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino). They need to get past the Mexican border to a bar named the ""Titty Twister."" Along the way they take hostage the Fuller family, Jacob (Harvey Keital), Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). In the second part of the movie they make it to the bar, unfortunately it is a bar run by vampires and soon enough the feasting begins.This movie is great in a lot of ways. First, the script is written brilliant, it is darkly humorous. A lot of the lines had be laughing very hard. The acting is good from all the cast and the special effects are pretty disgusting. We have decapitations, limbs getting torn off, throats getting ripped out and plenty of impalements. For gore hounds, this movie is gold. This movie never really gets boring. This movie is not meant to be anything groundbreaking, just entertaining, which it is.3Â½/5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Crime/Horror,"I loved this film for many reasons. For one, the switch from a crime thriller to a horror thriller was seamless. I for one had not heard much about this film before I watched it, and I assumed the TV Times were mistaken in called this a gory horror thriller. To me, it was a simple crime thriller, the norm which is expected from Tarantino's pen. However, the switch was such a shock and so fast, that I didn't now what happened I was amazed at this revelation, since there was no word of any horror topics beforehand in the script. It was completely out of the blue, and resulted in a pleasant surprise.And the thing that's interesting is that BOTH halves to this film, both the crime section and horror section are enjoyable. The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. A great premise with an equally great script in the first half. The second section is also great because of the horrific violence and as I heard mentioned before, the unique ways on how to kill vampires.The script is witty and full of dark humour, ""I have 6 little friends and they all run faster than you."", and the intro is certainly one of the best I have seen in months. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the 'gentleman' (well, not really) crook, Tarantino as his psychotic brother (who, strangely, I found difficult not to warm to) and Keitel is the preacher who has lost his faith, the hostage who will help out later when the satanic hordes unleash themselves.A special mention must go to Salma Hayek for that special dance. ;) While this film was never made out of blockbuster material, it is still very understated, taking a unique and perhaps surreal viewing on the horror genre, all the while using horror stereotypes. As far as graphic violence is concerned, it is on par with the likes of Evil Dead (well, perhaps not THAT bad).For once, this is a film which doesn't give the viewer all the answers beforehand. You are in the same boat as the characters and you don't know what's in store for them. If you hadn't seen this before, without any knowledge of the movie, you'd be in for a huge surprise as I was.An 8/10 for it's script (thanks to Tarantino) and the actors who, while not trying too hard, make this an enjoyable horror flick with a difference.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"If Seth Gecko had taken on those tomatoes, they never would have eaten France.","George Clooney should have stuck will this kind of role. He did fine in Out of Sight and Ocean's Eleven, but he really dominated this movie with a fury that we may never see again. Almost every line he delivers is memorable and that is not all Tarantino's doing. The rest of the cast is dominated by cool cameos and veteran cult and mainstream names. The exception being Ernest Liu who does a good job of holding his own. No Tarantino film would be complete without a good soundtrack. This one, as with Desperado, features songs by Tito and Tarantula. Although I have only heard four songs by them, I consider them one of my favorites. I will never forget what my parents told me after they watched this without me. ""You sure can pick 'em,"" my mother blurted with distain.

"Robbers and Preachers and Vampires, oh my!","Anyone trying to do a 'serious review' of this movie needs to lighten up. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the Gecko brothers, two bad, bad men on their way to Mexico. Along the way they pick up a preacher played by Harvey Keitel and his two kids. They're supposed to meet a partner at a bar called The Titty Twister, and once they get there madness ensues. From there it takes a turn that many seem to find infuriating but I personally find highly entertaining. It's humming along like a typical Tarantino picture, and then- BOOM. Out of nowhere, it becomes all too clear that these two bad, bad men are not by a longshot the baddest in *this* bar. All of this can- and *will*, given the right attitude on the part of the viewers- read as a loving high-five to 70s zombie flicks, a homage to the campy fun of those movies. The tough guy dialog continues throughout, the gore level is astounding, and we see via Kate- the preacher's daughter, played by Juliette Lewis- that sometimes a p***ed-off virgin with a crossbow can more than hold her own. On top of that, it has a hella-cool biker-bar soundtrack and Salma Hayek in a bikini. What's not to like?",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Fans of The Evil Dead Need Apply,"From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)Review: How bout this? George Clooney in a different role? Yep. For once he tries something different.From Dusk Till Dawn is something else. This is about two criminal brothers(Clooney and Tarantino)wind up taking a family hostage to make it across the Mexican border to a meeting point, a bar called the ""Titty Twister"". That's where the Gecko brothers are to meet another group of crooks.....at dawn. This bar is open from dusk till dawn....and is filled with vampires.This movie starts off as something else at first. More like a gritty crime movie, then becomes a total spatter-fest. This isn't at all bad, just takes a total turn. The vampires here are a bunch of ugly as hell monsters. Think of the Evil Dead movies only the undead zombies and skeletons are vampires instead and that's the score with the very small supply of vampire slayers to take them on.Like I say, if you are a fan of the Evil Dead movies, then this is the treat for you. It does not have the amount of silly humor like them, but has the gore nailed just right. The makeup effects are dead-on as well. This just happens to be more gritty than the Evil Dead.The Last Word: I like it. Good for your October needs. Did I forget Salma Hayek and Cheech Marin? They are here as well. Good bloody fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Great action-packed thrill ride!,"Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are probably the two most recognizable faces of the generation of filmmakers who had their start in the independent scene of the early 90s. Rodriguez had a tremendous success with his western-inspired action movie ""El Mariachi"" while Tarantino reached fame and glory after updating heist movies in ""Reservoir Dogs"". Their friendship lead them to make movies together starting with ""Four Rooms"", but together with make-up masters Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger the two young directors crafted one of the most original movies of the 90s: ""From Dusk Till Dawn"".The plot starts with the escape of two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Tarantino himself) and their effort to reach Mexico kidnapping the family of a faith-less preacher named Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) who was traveling with his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and his son Scott (Ernest Liu). In their escape the group will arrive to a Mexican strip club where nothing is what it seems.The story (by Kurtzman) is a very good mix of action, western and horror cleverly put together in Tarantino's witty script. Rodriguez direction gives the film the a 70s feeling that gives the movie a Drive-In spirit pretty much in tone with the plot. In fact, at times the film feels like an updated version of exploitation action films of that era. This lack of pretensions makes it even more enjoyable as it never tries to be something else than pure entertainment.The movie is interestingly divided in two, the first half dedicated to establishing the relationships between the characters, particularly the complicated clash of the Geckos and the Fullers, in a typical Tarantino style crime/drama fashion; on the other hand, the second half is an action packed thrill ride on the style of 70s action movies that clearly shows John Carpenter's influence over Rodriguez. While it is definitely a tribute to their influences, the Rodriguez/Tarantino team create a solid movie that stands on its own as a very original take on horror movies.The acting is very effective, with George Clooney carrying the film as the cool-headed older brother who has to take care of his psychotic younger brother. Tarantino is average, but he was certainly having fun with the role. Keitel is terrific as always and is perfect as the faithless pastor who doesn't trust in God anymore. Apearances by Salma Hayek and make-up virtuoso Tom Savini have small but unforgettable roles. Savini steals the film in his role as a biker that brings back memories of his part in Romero's classic ""Dawn of the Dead"". All in all is a very complete and solid cast that certainly gives the movie a very special flavor.The special effects by KNB are top-notch, but the CGI used in some scenes is poor when compared to the traditional prosthetic make-up employed in the rest of the film. While the violence is never intended to be realistic, the poor CGI at times make it look more cartoon-like than what it was supposed to be, but it is not a real damaging flaw and the film is still highly enjoyable.Rodriguez has always done films to have fun, and this is what has set him apart from other filmmakers (Tarantino included). His lack of pretensions and his dedication to his craft seem to transmit the fun he has making movies to the audience who watches them. While his films may not have an introspective depth or a high philosophical meaning, they work perfectly as entertainment of the highest quality. This underrated film is probably among his best and most enjoyable films of his young career. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

destroyed by itself...,"I remember when I first saw this movie, the first hour was awesome, amazing, I was interested, involved, and wanting more. Then everyone turned into vampires and it became an entirely different movie. It was like they took a really good drama/action movie, and combined it with a horrible B horror movie. It literally was like watching two different movies, one that was great, and one that was just plain awful, and they just happened to have the same characters, and both be about an hour long. I wish they had just stuck with the first movie, instead of seeming to say ,after writing about half, you know what would be cool, a movie about vampires that live in a Mayan temple, hey I know let's just turn this movie into that one, yeah...

Not Your Average Mexican Hay-ride,"Although I am not AS lovestruck with this film as many other reviewers are, I did find it an entertaining albeit conscience-churning experience.  From Dusk Till Dawn really is two films in one.  The first part tells the story of the Gecko boys(Not Geico) played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino. They are escapees from the law and have killed over a dozen people brutally already by the time the film opens.  For me, this tale of how they kill a gas station guy and finally abduct a preacher and his two children for their RV is the most chilling part of the film.  Clooney plays a guy with little moral conscience well.  Tarentino does a good job too and you can see his wit throughout the script.  I found both men very despicable, so I guess the acting was good.  The film falls into parody/farce, however, once the the whole gang(the two Geckos and the preacher and his daughter and son)reach a strip club/bar out in the middle of nowhere in Mexico.  What happens here, to the uninformed viewer, will be totally unexpected.  Does it work?  To a degree, however, the film really loses momentum and credibility it might have had.  The acting in general is all acceptable.  Harvey Keitel once again shows us why he is such a good actor.  Juliette Lewis is also very good in her role as his daughter.  Nice to see guys like Tom Savini and Fred Williamson too.  Oh, and Salma Hayek IS the highlight of the film.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Bizarrely entertaining - loud, trashy, vulgar...fun. Not great, though.","Coming into this I knew it would be action over content - after all it was directed by Robert Rodriguez. The fact that the script was written by Tarantino didn't really mean anything since I had gathered from various sources that this was Tarantino's homage to the ""splatstick"" genre (of Evil Dead, etc.) and as a result the script probably wasn't so hot compared to Pulp Fiction.For the most part this is true. The first half of the movie IS really good in terms of cleverness and Tarantino-style stuff - good dialogue, interesting plot and unlikeable characters...unique. The second half, after they cross the border into Mexico - as others here have pointed out - becomes the Evil Dead segment of the film, where everything turns into some over-the-top, bizarre, gross-out vampire blood-'n-guts movie with bad special effects and cheesy scenes. (Albeit fun ones.) Some have complained that the transformation from seriousness to sudden vampire comic book content is too fast and the story would have been far more interesting had it been rooted in realism for its entire duration. Yes, and no. Rodriguez set out to make an homage to the spaghetti western/Evil Dead genre and did so. Tarantino's script is just the baseline for it all. It's like a bunch of friends got together and decided to make a movie - albeit friends with fairly good reputations as filmmakers. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Tarantino - not a bad cast! Had this been presented as an epic crime movie Tarantino would have helmed it. However due to the fact that he provided Rodriguez with the script and even performed a commentary track on the film's DVD release (something he does on none of his own directed films) just goes to show that Tarantino wasn't in it for the praise - he was in it for the fun and experience. Ditto for everyone else.And in that regard this is a pretty fun movie. Like Rodriguez' DESPERADO, it's a guilty pleasure for viewers and cast - a bunch of highly esteemed actors get together and have a blast.So no, this is not a great movie. The second half could be replaced with a more serious half and I think it would probably be one of the best thrillers ever if this was done. (Just imagine how great it could have been if it had been brought to a poetically justified ending with some sort of Gecko Brothers/law enforcement shootout a la Butch Cassidy/Bonnie and Clyde.) However I understand that's not what Rodriguez and crew set out to do with this movie - they just wanted to make an entertaining cult popcorn blockbuster flick.And they succeeded. It's entertaining and hip and stylish. Recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Outrageous!,"It was probably the most fun I had at the cinema back in 1996. I absolutely love ""From Dusk Till Dawn"", very much one of those films that you either buy into or you don't. There's no surprise element with the film, you get everything that director Robert Rodriguez and writer Quentin Tarantino said you would get - a hard buttocked road movie that turns into a raging ""B"" horror movie gore fest.The plot, for what's it's worth, sees two criminal brothers, Seth (George Clooney) & Richie Gecko (Tarantino) on the lam after Richie breaks Seth out of prison. They are heading for the haven of Mexico with wads of cash garnered from a robbery. After overcoming a couple of fatal (for others) hiccups, the brothers, in need of a vehicle, kidnap faithless minister Jacob (Harvey Keitel), his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and adopted son Scott (Ernest Liu). From here they must make it to a rendezvous point in Mexico - a bar called ""The Titty Twister"", where they will exchange cash with a friend of Seth's and start their new lives as Mexican civilians. Trouble is, is that ""The Titty Twister"" isn't no ordinary bar, it's a vampire stronghold and the Geko's - and their newly acquired captives, are on the menu. Can they make it till dawn and let the daylight be their saviour?.Swearing, blood, limbs severed, nudity, violence, sexual references, guns, more violence, more blood, other weapons, lots of teeth, bats, a snake, more violence. On it goes really, yet as Rodriguez and Tarantino start thrusting a blunt blade into your stomach, you really should be feeling them also caressing the funny bones in both your arms. For it's a key point that ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a damn funny film as well, something that bizarrely many critics have failed to understand. Honestly you can go to various sites and read people saying the characters are shallow, or the plot is preposterous!! Dear me, it staggers the mind. Hey don't like the film by all means, but failure to understand its genre leanings and homage persuasion is as funny as Cheech Marin is in the movie (one of many awesome ""B"" cult movie actors in the pic).

Clooney and Tarantino make a classic duo in two powerhouse and differing performances.

Gore + vampires + Tarantino & Rodriquez= great entertainment,"Robert Rodriguez's From Dusk till Dawn combines vicious violence, Cheech Marin vampires, and some funny humor from the cast into one big collective film.  More than a basic horror movie, it has Rodriquez as a fine director and Quentin Tarantino as a good screenwriter who bring to the screen basic shoot em up fun.  Not all of it is for the people out there, but for thrill seeking teens, it's worth a glance.The story involves 2 criminal brothers (George Clooney and Tarantino) who are part focused and part insane.  They kidnap a family (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis) and bring them to a bar called the T**y twister while waiting for morning and their money prize.  But what ensues in that bar is terrific fun in which all the members are vampires and are relentless ""from dusk till dawn"".

Action-packed vampire flick...,"I remember back in 1996 when this movie initially came out, I wasn't particularly thrilled. Why?

The movie was a slap in the face surprise first time around when I watched it, but it has gradually grown better and better.While the movie does start out slow, it quickly picks up pace as the story of the homicidal Gecko brothers unfold. On the run from the law, the outlaw brothers take a preacher and his family hostage as they make their way towards Mexico. At the Mexican rendezvous, a bar named The Titty Twister, things go from bad to worse as night falls, and blood-sucking vampires from Hell infest the seedy bar.""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a wonderful mix of action, comedy and horror. A mix that director Robert Rodriguez managed to pull off quite nicely.The vampires in the movie were quite a treat. Why? Well, they were not the charming, romantic Gothic creatures as seen in many other vampire movies, nor were they sparkly teenage heartthrobs seen in later movies. No, they were bestial and animalistic savage creatures. And the special effects were good and right on the money.The cast in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was off the charts. While I didn't particularly Clooney and Tarantino in my younger years, I have learned to get past that. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are actually phenomenal in the movie. But the movie has a heap of other great talents on the cast list, including Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Tom Savini, Cheech Marin and Fred Williamson.This 1996 movie is a definite must watch movie, whether you like vampires or not, and it spawned two less impressive sequels and an awful TV series.

BEST vampire movie ever made!!!,"I remember when I went to see this film at the theatre, I was 14 years old, at the time there was no internet or social media yet (good times) so little or nothing was known about every film that came out, so this film, on the surface it seemed like a pulp noir, in fact it is, but as we all know, it's not just that, if it had come out today, everything would have been known ""thanks"" to these damned social networks.But let's go back to the film:
The first part is great, it starts immediately at maximum speed with a mix of the style of Rodriguez (director of the film) fresh from El Mariachi and Desperado and a mix of the style of Tarantino (screenwriter and actor of the film) who was fresh from Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, so the whole first part of the film is really cool anyway, then the second part begins, which we all know by now, everything explodes in a bloodbath, and scary monsters made with the old and classic make up, from the crime pulp we move on to a wild and super gore vampire movie where finally we don't have the usual cool, fascinating vampires, but disgusting and horrifying monsters thirsty for blood. The final battle is one of the most spectacular sequences seen in both horror and action.A mention is also due to the cast with a still little-known George Clooney in an unusual role, his best role in my opinion, which he will never be able to replicate again, Tarantino absolutely perfect in the role of the crazy rapist gangster and obviously excellent, as always, Harvey Keitel as a priest who has lost his faith, but who will have to find it again to fight the ravenous vampires.To this day I consider From Dusk Till Dawn the best vampire film ever made, I would like more films of this type, but today unfortunately it seems that no one is capable of making valid films anymore, today everyone is satisfied with mediocre and useless films .",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Tune in for a Tarantino Style movie, and your mouth'll fall right open half-way","Since I am a gangster movie buff who can't get enough of the Tarantino classics Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, I was all set for some more of the great dialogue and keenly directed diction of these two films when I tuned in for FDTD. After the somewhat exaggerated burning scene at the start, one is inclined to think, 'well the Tarantino atmosphere is there, he just got carried away.' Indeed, Harvey Keitel, naturally, but also George Clooney, and Tarantino himself continue to pronounce their well-chosen lines with exactly the right emphasis and all seems set for more interesting plot turns. However, being completely unprepared for Mexicans rising from the dead and turning into monsters, I found myself gazing stupefied at what followed.(The presence of Juliette Lewis might have warned me that something weird was coming, but since the Tarantino character seemed the central psycho of the story, I didn't expect inhumans in any literal way). How could he and Rodriguez have thrown their fine ingredients into this maladorous boiling pot of illogical nonsense? Now that I learn that this was his first script, I hope for a return to the older, or rather later developed style. All in all, as a horror comedy the movie has its moments and it is worth seeing, but I think it could have been so much better if the story line of the first part would have been followed to the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

I am huge fan of this movie. This and Fright Night (1985) are my favorite vampire films but From Dusk Till Dawn is my number 1 favorite Vampire film of all time it is above Fright Night (1985).""Welcome to slavery, No, thanks. I've already had a wife.""I like Robert Rodriguez: Not Hughe fan of El Mariachi, but I love Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico with Johnny Depp, I would say those two are great films he directed. The Faculty I like a lot, i watch it as a teen on VHS have not seen the movie in a while, but a good sci-fi horror movie of the 90's. Quentin Tarantino his movies I like Kill Bill: Vol. , Jackie Brown was okay movie and Pulp Fiction I really love, I have not seen that movie in a long time. I love Rodriguez and Tarantino this is my favorite film they ever did together, my all time favorite. Quentin Tarantino wrote the script and acted, he did a great job I love his character Richard Gecko. My favorite George Clooney film as Seth Gecko the best one he ever did. I like The Peacemaker with Nicole Kidman, I don't mind him in that film. Clooney never played a character as cool like this one again. Three years ago was 20th anniversary, this film come out in 1996 in which that time was a hit.The film was wery well written it has great cast: George Clooney,
Juliette Lewis, Quentin Tarantino does a fine as Richie Gecko brother of the brothers Gecko famous bank robbers. You have Harvey Keitel as a preacher, who lost his wife and has 2 kids one of them is Juliette Lewis. Cheech Marin is in three roles which is fun. Danny Trejo is in here I think he was in all three From Dusk Till Dawn movies. You have Fred Williamson which I love his character Frost, he is Vietnam Vet he was in Vietnam 1972, he killed single handly all VC platoon. We have Tom Savini who is a horror master in FX effects as Sex Machine. Kelly Preston, Salma Hayek, John Saxon and Michael Parks are in here really excellent cast.The first hour has characters arc build which it works still today. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are the bad guys. They are not the good guys in here, they are not bank robbers with heart of gold, they are bad boys and they will kill you for real. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are in this bar Titty Twister and vampires appear and Clooney, Tom Savini, Fred Willamson are killing all those vampires. You have table of four legs and Fred Williamson pins them all. Tom Savini stakes Danny Trejo in a bad-ass scene. I love those Vampires, I love the effects how they look. George Clooney, Harvey Keitel are fighting vampires who are attacking them. Ghoulies and zombie typs love the effects. George Clooney has Jack Hammer with a stake and he kills the vampires. Harvey Keitel has a shotgun with a cross and shoots the vampires. Juliette Lewis has crossbow, she shots with arrows the vampires, she is a bad-ass. I love the actress to death.The score is well done, I absolutelly love the soundtrack: Dark Night by The Blasters such a cool song love the soundtrack to death. I am going to gave that song in my cell phone. I love She's Just Killing Me by ZZ Top those 2 soundtracks are cool. I really love those cool songs this movie has.Great dialogue in the film, I love George Clooney I love his character, he is an anti-hero, he is a lead guy in here, I like him and he does a great job. The action is well done. It is Rated R for strong violence and gore, language and nudity. It has gore, lots of bodys, great kills, bad-ass film. We have little action in the store in the open scene. Great well done practical effects, no CGI effects in here, great flamable explosion and epic finale.

Super Good Time,"A comedic horror romp written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Robert Rodriguez-this is a lot of fun. The cast is all star. Tarantino, Clooney, and Keitel are the stars, and they are very good. The cast is littered with great stars like John Saxon, Kelly Preston, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin (multiple roles), and the legendary Fred Williamson. The Direction and cinematography are really good. The movie has a unique and interesting look. What starts out as a 1970's type robbery and hostage film turns into a vampire film that makes for a really good time. The interplay between the seasoned Clooney, and the novice Tarantino, as actors is really the heart of the movie. Juliette Lewis is as likable as always as Keitel's fiesty daughter. She has a Cape Fear vibe in it. Best Like, ""Q: Where are you taking us? A. Mexico. Q: What's in Mexico. A: Mexicans?"" There were sequels, but none can top this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
108 minutes of pure fun,"Well, I can tell u  one thing this movie is pure fun:the dialogues are great, the acting is terrific(especially Quentin Tarantino) and the special effects are nice.You probably asking WHY THIS MOVIE HAVE 6.6 RATING?? , I think that the reason for this is Quentin Tarantino, when people heard QT IS involved in the production of the movie they thought it has similarity to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction, actually, it's very different from those films, and that is something that can show us the greatness of QUENTIN TARANTINO.In the bottom line,I liked this movie and I  recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Not the best vampire movie,"I've read many reviews about the movie and most say that the two different stories within the movie just don't seem to connect very well. I don't really agree. I think the dramatic shift change made the movie more interesting, even though the shift change could have been made a smoother. The thing that brings the movie's rating down is the fact that the action gets really old after awhile. The action is in the EVIL DEAD style, but it just doesn't have the same way of keeping you entertained as it did in EVIL DEAD. The movie still isn't bad though. I would advise that you watch the movie because of the great PULP FICTION style dialog in the beginning of the movie. There are a bunch of really great lines. Overall, I give the movie a 6 1/2.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
A film of 2 halves - neither very good,"Clooney and Tarantino are brothers on the run from the law.  When they spend the evening in a truckers strip club they find more thrills than they had expected.  This film was trading on several things - the success of Tarantino, Clooney's star power and the hot property of Rodriguez after Desperado.  Unfortunately these are the main things the film has going for it.The first half of the film is quite good and plays like a Tarantino-esque crime thriller, until they reach the club where it turns into a gory vampire b-movie.  The special effects are good but messy but it replaces tension and thrills with gore and makes the second half of the film a messy fight rather than a tension standoff.  The crime section is good because Keitel, Clooney and Lewis are good in their roles - Clooney deserves special mention as he plays a tough cruel killer, well against type and is the epitome of tattooed cool.  Tarantino however can't act, he's a good director and should do more of that rather than turning in performances like this.The film is a messy action movie, it lacks structure, tension or any emotional core - whenever the actors get turned to vampires you don't really care.  It replaces all these with gore and special effects.  It's worth watching to see Clooney playing against type but outside of that there isn't much else here to justify watching.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
This is what horror movies should be like,"From the very opening until the last gritty final shot, thisaction/horror film is balls to the wall greatness. The script ishilarious with some great dialogue mostly done by Clooney, thespecial effects are amazing thanks to KNB (who got their startworking with Sex Machine's Tom Savini on early films such as Dayof the Dead) and Rodrigez camera moves so quickly and fast pacedthat you will never catch your breathe.

Cult Classic,"This is a non-stop roller coaster ride of a movie. If you are a fan of Robert Rodriguez and / or Quentin Tarantino you will hands down love this movie. Whether you are a fan of the vampire genre or every horror movies, From Dusk til Dawn is a movie devoted to the traditional cult movie with its storyline and cast. The most interesting thing about the movie is its cast. You have many big name stars, but none of them are Hollywood esq. actors. Most if not all the actors were at one time in their lives, struggling actors. Many have done independent / low budget movies because they would never say ""no"" to work. Harvey Keitel couldn't find work for years, George Clooney started out on the Facts of Life and Juliette Lewis keeps surprising us all with the kinds of movie roles shes chooses. Salma Hayek, Cheech Marin and Tom Savini add their talents to the movie as well. All three are best examples of actors who got to where they are with their own talent. Neither one had to sell out, use other people or have a cousin working in the industry for them to get an opportunity to be in movies. From Dusk til Dawn is a labor of love to the popular cult genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Two Movies In One,"This is unusual in that it is really two separate movies in one: the first half is a crime story and the second half is a vampire extravaganza.THE BAD NEWS - Harvey Keitel plays a Baptist minister who has ""lost his faith"" after this wife's death and intimates that those who have it are fools. In truth, he's just mad at God after what happened and he dos somewhat come back to his faith at the end. Of course, it takes a killer to preach to him at the end! Only in Hollywood do we have this kind of secular nonsense preached! The whole Keitel character is so theologically weak and ridiculous that it's past me getting upset over it. I just hope viewers aren't stupid enough to believe this kind of minister is normal (and acts and talks as like he does in this film.)Anyway, people watching this should also be aware that there is a lot of ""language,"" meaning tons of f-words said by about everyone. There is a lot of gore, too, in the vampire half of the film. So, if you expect all this or aren't offended by it, you are in for one wild ride because.....THE GOOD NEWS - Despite with very low morality of this movie, it is extremely entertaining and never, despite multiple viewings, gets dull although the violence gets to be a little much at the end. It would have been a better film had it been cut about 10-15 minutes. George Clooney, as the more stable of the two killers, ""Seth Gecko,"" is fascinating to hear. Although obnoxious, he is easily the the most fascinating character in a film filled with weirdos. It's one of the most interesting characters Clooney has ever played.This is stylishly filmed and humorous in parts. It has the Richard Rodriguez (""El Mariachi trilogy) look all over it: stylish, outrageous and cartoon-like at times. Actually, many of the characterizers here a pretty perverse, especially Clooney's brother and partner, ""Richard"" (Quentin Tarantino). What a sicko he is! At least Tarantinto played himself, making his role easier to play.The people at the bar in the second half of the film (featuring actors Danny Trejo, Tom Savin, Fred Williamson and Selma Hayak) have to be seen to be believed! You want to know who sleazy this can get? Just listen to Cheech Marin's ""pussy"" speech outside the bar. That about says it all.Finally, the music in here is very good, if you are a fan of the blues and especially the Vaughan brothers. This is one of those ""guilty pleasures"" I can never decide whether to own or not. I got rid of it, but wouldn't mind seeing it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Thoroughly entertaining crime/horror mash-up from Rodriguez & Tarantino,"""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is one of the few Quentin Tarantino screenplays that he didn't direct himself. In a bit of a change, he took an acting role and handed the directorial reins to Robert Rodriguez. A modest success at the time of its release, the movie has since gone on to gain a cult following.The story revolves around a pair of criminals (George Clooney & Quentin Tarantino) who seek refuge in Mexico following a big score. Taking a family hostage, they head to an isolated strip club in order to rendezvous with their contact. However, they get more than they bargained for when they realize that the club is a haven for blood-thirsty vampires.Although basically a B movie, the cast is well assembled. George Clooney, in one of his first starring roles, seems at home delivering Tarantino's snappy dialogue. Tarantino himself is pretty good, too, but easily overshadowed by the likes of Harvey Keitel & Juliette Lewis. Of the supporting actors, Fred Williamson & Tom Savini stand out in particular while Salma Hayek, Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Michael Parks & John Hawkes all made the most of their limited screen time.Tarantino's script is rife with his trademark dialogue and Rodriguez directed the movie with panache. Unlike ""True Romance"" or ""Natural Born Killers"", I think that Rodriguez's take on the material is pretty close to what Tarantino's would have been. The special effects are handled pretty well also, though rudimentary effects don't necessarily detract from the appeal of a B movie.It seems that the main problem people have with this movie is how it starts out as a straight crime movie before morphing into a horror movie. Personally, I find both parts of the movie entertaining in their own way. With a lively script and a great cast, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" makes for a top notch B movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Disturbingly Decent,"Tarantino has a way of making even the strangest concept a fairly decent watch. The dialogue is consistently strong- as you'd expect from a Tarantino flick- yet does have some cringe-worthy lines. George Clooney and Harvey Keital both put noteworthy performances, and whilst it is obvious Tarantino doesn't have the talent of the former names, his performance is very much tolerable. A film which it's first two acts exceed the craziness of the third, it's a fun watch",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Good,"Certainly! Here's a 600-word review of Outlander (2014):Outlander (2014) Review: A Time-Traveling Epic of Romance and HistoryOutlander, the television adaptation of Diana Gabaldon's beloved novel series, premiered in 2014, bringing to life an enthralling blend of romance, history, and science fiction. The series, developed by Ronald D. Moore, has since become a cultural phenomenon, captivating audiences with its rich storytelling, complex characters, and breathtaking cinematography.Plot and PremiseThe story follows Claire Beauchamp Randall (CaitrÃ­ona Balfe), a World War II nurse who, while on a second honeymoon in Scotland with her husband Frank (Tobias Menzies), is mysteriously transported back to 1743. In this perilous time, she meets and falls in love with Jamie Fraser (Sam Heughan), a dashing Highland warrior. Claire's struggle to adapt to the past while torn between her love for Frank and her growing passion for Jamie forms the emotional core of the series.Characterization and PerformanceCaitrÃ­ona Balfe's portrayal of Claire is nothing short of extraordinary. Her performance is nuanced and deeply emotional, capturing the strength, intelligence, and vulnerability of her character. Balfe's chemistry with Sam Heughan is palpable, making Claire and Jamie's love story both believable and compelling. Heughan brings a charismatic depth to Jamie, portraying him as both a fierce warrior and a tender lover.Tobias Menzies excels in his dual role as Frank Randall and the sinister Jonathan ""Black Jack"" Randall, showcasing his range as an actor. His portrayal of Black Jack is particularly chilling, adding a layer of danger and suspense to the narrative.Historical Context and AuthenticityOne of Outlander's most commendable aspects is its meticulous attention to historical detail. The series immerses viewers in the 18th century with authentic settings, costumes, and historical events. From the Jacobite risings to the Battle of Culloden, Outlander seamlessly weaves historical facts into its fictional narrative, enriching the story and providing a compelling historical backdrop.The show's depiction of 18th-century Scotland is visually stunning. The Scottish Highlands serve as both a beautiful and harsh setting, capturing the rugged landscapes and the tumultuous era with cinematic grandeur.Production QualityOutlander boasts high production values that contribute significantly to its appeal. The cinematography, helmed by Alasdair Walker, is breathtaking, capturing the natural beauty of the Highlands and the intricacies of the period settings. The costume design by Terry Dresbach is equally impressive, meticulously recreating the attire of the era and adding authenticity to the series.Bear McCreary's haunting and evocative score further elevates the show's atmosphere. The opening theme, ""The Skye Boat Song,"" has become iconic, perfectly setting the tone for each episode.Themes and DepthOutlander explores complex themes such as love, loyalty, and the clash between modern and historical values. Claire's journey is not just physical but also emotional and intellectual, as she navigates the challenges of a time when women's roles were vastly different from her own era. The show also delves into the brutal realities of war, politics, and cultural conflict, offering a rich tapestry of human experiences.Reception and ImpactThe series has been well-received by both critics and audiences. CaitrÃ­ona Balfe has earned several accolades for her performance, including nominations for Golden Globe Awards. The show's ability to balance romance, action, and historical drama has been praised, though some critics have noted the occasional pacing issues and the graphic nature of some scenes.Despite these criticisms, Outlander remains a compelling and beautifully crafted series that continues to draw viewers into its complex world. Its blend of genres, strong performances, and commitment to historical accuracy set it apart in the landscape of modern television.ConclusionOutlander is more than just a historical drama; it's a sweeping epic that challenges the boundaries of genre storytelling. With its deeply engaging characters, lush production, and intricate plotlines, it offers something for everyone-be it romance, history, or adventure. As it continues to unfold across its multiple seasons, Outlander promises to remain a landmark series that transports viewers through time and emotion, leaving an indelible mark on television history.Does this review meet your expectations, or would you like any adjustments?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
The coolest thing about it is the soundtrack,"You really have to be a fifteen-year-old boy to get the most out of From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). I certainly did, back in the day. I had the movie, the OST, I even had the screenplay. Coming back to the movie today, oh boy, what a caper.It gets off to a great start. The opening scene at the little store, with the clerk and the police officer shootin' the s*** over a brewskie, that's great, especially with the sudden surprise that comes when the sheriff heads to the head. Clooney and Tarantino play Seth and Richie, bank robbers on the run, making a dash for Mexico. They take a family of three hostage in an RV and set their destination to a seedy biker bar called The Titty Twister. Once they get there, well, things really kick off.As a teenager, I never thought that Clooney was 100% plausible as an action hero, warrior, badass. Back then even Matt Le Blanc had a bash at being the brawn in some kind of Sci-Fi adventure movie. Clooney remains, for me, a sort of second-rate Cary Grant, but any comparison to Grant demands some measure of esteem. Remember Cary famously told a fan that he also wished he was Cary Grant (the starry image being, of course, an invention of the silver screen). Clooney is in an awkward zone, too clever for soppy rom-coms, but also too intelligent and not quite heroic enough to be Action Man. The less said about his catastrophic stint as Batman the better.Tarantino, who wrote the screenplay, was still kidding himself that he could act back in the 90s. He can, a bit, but not well enough to be a leading actor. Harvey Keitel, now, he can act. There is also the strong presence of the guy from Shaft, and Tom Savini, legendary special effects maestro, in an acting role (playing Sex Machine). Cheech Marin makes a wonderful cameo in this movie. Or was it three cameos?And what about Salma Hayek, the living embodiment of Latina sex appeal. Her snake-clad dance will live in your memory forever. This is why the movie is ideal for teenagers. It's the definitive guys' movie. A road movie of sorts; a horror-comedy, buoyed up by a way-out-west, rock'n'roll soundtrack; tequila and whisky, gasoline and smokes, revolvers and roundhouses. The dialogue is pretty cool, and the story doesn't drag (QT isn't directing).But it sure does become silly and cartoonish once the vampires show-up. That's no spoiler, the movie description mentions vampires. The attempt to combine crime-road-movie, like Bonnie & Clyde or Thelma & Louise, with a vampire/haunted-house caper, is a fresh if flawed idea. And this movie is pretty cool, at least 50% of it. It's just not quite sure if it is a comedy or a horror or a drama or anything else. And the ending is a bit flat.I'm way past the age when I thought this movie was awesome. But even as a teen I had my doubts. I can't imagine what today's earnest youngsters would make of it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
From bad till worse,"One wonders if Tarantino wrote this script when he was 14 and just dusted it off. Everything about this movie -which is actually two bad stories stuck together to make one turkey- has an adolescent feel to it with its stylised and sadistic violence, gratuitous nudity, clichÃ© ridden vampires, f-laden dialogue, gunplay, biker bars, girls on the toilet etc.Clooney and Tarantino play a couple of murderous brothers. Clooney is apparently the 'good' brother. He merely burns an innocent man alive, puts a gun to the heads of helpless women and children and shoots some bikers in cold blood. In what moral universe can such a character be considered a hero? The film makers seem to think so, since he is allowed to drive off into the sunset at the end, not just scot free by with a sexy young preacher's daughter hanging on his every word.Tarantino is the 'bad' brother. He improves on Clooney by shooting a ranger in the head point blank and raping and murdering an innocent abducted woman.These two then abduct Harvey Keitel and his son and daughter. Keitel is a clichÃ© pastor who has lost his faith. Since Tarantino's gifts as a dialogue writer do not extend much beyond foul mouthed tirades (admittedly he does excel at that), this man of god and his young daughter are given the same f-bomb speech patterns as the 'heroes'.The first half of the movie is a deeply unpleasant series of indiscriminate murders, rapes and abductions. There is a brief satirical news report which is strangely out of place here, since the general atmosphere is menacing and aggressive.When they arrive in Mexico the film suddenly morphs into a poor vampire film. Two more formulaic characters appear out of nowhere, a cigar-chomping black man and a Mexican with a cannon codpiece. Together they fight an assortment of vampires as the film becomes campy and incoherent. The dialogue here, usually Tarantino's forte, is embarrassing. One could expect and even enjoy this sort of thing from a low budget movie, but one with Clooney and Tarantino in it? For supposedly top Hollywood talent, it is extraordinarily bad.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
One of My Favorite Cult Movies,"After a bank heist in Abilene with several casualties, the bank robber Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his psychopath and rapist brother Richard Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) continue their crime spree in a convenience store in the middle of the desert while heading to Mexico with a hostage. They decide to stop for a while in a low-budget motel.Meanwhile the former minister Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) is traveling on vacation with his son Scott (Ernest Liu) and his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) in a RV. Jacob lost his faith after the death of his beloved wife in a car accident and quit his position of pastor of his community and stops for the night in the same motel Seth and Richard are lodged.When Seth sees the recreational vehicle, he abducts Jacob and his family to help his brother and him to cross the Mexico border, promising to release them on the next morning. They head to the truck drivers and bikers bar Titty Twister where Seth will meet with his partner Carlos in the dawn. When they are watching the dancer Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek), Seth and Richard fight with three bodyguards. But soon they discover that the bar is a coven of vampires and they need to fight until dawn to leave the place alive.""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is definitely one of my favorite cult movies. I have just seen it again, now on Blu-ray, and the film is still entertaining. The plot is divided in two parts, the first one (and the better) with the violence of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and the second part is funny, entwining horror with comedy. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Um Drink no Inferno"" (""One Drink in Hell"")",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"A grusome, fun look at Vampires and Crime","Directed by the Producers of both ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Desperado,"" everybody thought that ""Dusk Till Dawn"" would probably be a masterpiece: the cream of the crop of the corroborations of two great film makers.  Boy, were those optimists wrong.""From Dusk Till Dawn,"" in my opinion, is the combination of ""Evil Dead: 2"" and ""Pulp Fiction"".  It yields grusome action with a scary twist with a crime world twist with a funny twist.  If you like grusome, funny violence, then you'll like ""Dusk Till Dawn"".  This movie, despite all the bad publicity, is actually a pretty good movie if you don't mind blood, gore, nudity, and profanity.  If you're a teen-ager, you'll love it; if you're older, especially if you're a parent, you'll hate it.

The rest of the cake is meatloaf. It takes some getting used to, but you finish the cake anyway, because meatloaf is also delicious. Your impression of it as a whole, however, is obviously conflicted since those two things usually aren't combined in that manner which leaves you conflicted.You can't help to think that the person behind this creation meant for it to be this way, so you respect it's existence, even though you might not want to eat the cake ever again. There's a sting of regret, though.

This movie is entertaining, funny, and it has well developed  characters. Nothing is too far fetched, as long as you consider it's a  movie about vampires. It's not a horror movie.

Forefather to Grindhouse and Stepchild to Natural Born Killers,"The way I see it, there are two distinct ways to see this movie. One could bemoan it for robbing them of a full Tarantino movie, delivered in his prime, by saddling the plot with an unexpected swerve into Robert Rodriguez exploitation. Or they could sit back and enjoy it for the utterly unpredictable, bewildering, guns-blazing, ""I can't believe that just happened,"" speed boat ride that it is. I fall into the latter camp, and while both directors have undeniably made more intelligent, deep, well-rounded pictures, there's no denying From Dusk Till Dawn has a certain unusual charm that's tough to nail down. Tarantino's script elaborates loosely on a lot of the social observations he'd originally made in Natural Born Killers, while the film's semi-serious, tongue-in-cheek attitude is an obvious precursor to the superduo's later collaboration on Grindhouse, marking it as an evolutionary milestone of sorts for both. George Clooney steals almost every scene as a take-no-crap heistmeister who's desperate to cross the Mexican border, Harvey Keitel seems unusually understated as the soft-spoken jaded preacher, and Tarantino himself breaks out his C-level acting chops in an appropriately stiff, detached performance as Clooney's creepy, sexual predator of a brother.

"Not quite there, but damn close!","Robert Rodriquez proved that he could work with bigger budgets when he remade his debut film El Mariachi as Desperado. Now he has even more money, but he lets From Dusk to Dawn get buried under the special effects. Based on an early script by Quentin Tarantino, it gets off to a nastily amusing start. Two murdering brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko, yes, as in the lizard, are trying to get across the Mexican border after several bloody encounters. They hijack Jacob (Harvey Keitel), a lapsed minister, and his kids, who are on a camping trip in their RV. Once south of the border, the group heads for the rowdy rendezvous point, a remote, all-night bar called the Titty Twister. Here, DUSK gets wierd. The bikers and strippers who hang out at the Titty Twister turn out to be bloodthirsty vampires and the Kurtzman, Nicotero & Berger EFX Group takes over. The body parts start to fly, and the blood spurts skyward like a Texas gusher. The splatter grows repetitive and monotonous, lacking the gruesome wit of Sam Raimi's demented classic, Evil Dead 2. After all, how many melting heads can you watch? Keitel is terrific in a subdued portrayal, while support is provided by Cheech Marin (in three roles!).",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
The return of the B-movies!,"""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is a great crossover between A- and B-movies, that only a genius like Quentin Tarantino could have made possible: there are great character actors (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis) next to Hollywood superstars like George Clooney, Salma Hayek or Tarantino himself. Not to forget the excavation of almost forgotten cult-,trash- and C-movie actors like Cheech Marin, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini, John Saxon or Michael Parks. Of course, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is also the only serious horror film of the 90s, which gave this sickening genre some new impulses. While all those teenager flicks like ""The Faculty"" (also directed by Robert Rodriguez) were only rip-offs from their elder examples, FDTD has enough originality to be a real classic! This movie is full of slime and gore, absurd ideas (holy water filled in condoms), although the showdown reminded me a little bit on Peter JacksonÂ´s ""Braindead"". Instead you get a great performance from Salma Hayek, who is one of the most erotic women alive! Her dance is one of the most unforgettable moments ever featured in a horror film! Many people also find it idiotic to combine a gangster story with a splatter flick: well, you shouldnÂ´t take this movie too serious, because ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is nothing else but a B-movie with A-list actors. It exists from his crazy ideas and the pure fun entertainment! (9/10)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
B-movie leaves something to be desired,"Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez are Hollywood's bad boys. The two of them completely flaunt Hollywood conventions, doing what pretty much whatever they want. The two filmmakers have very similar styles, and a co-operative production between the two became inevitable. Unfortunately, their first combined effort is something of a disappointment.Two bank robbing brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gekko (QT himself) are fleeing to Mexico to live a life of luxury. Along the way, they hijack an RV driven by Jacob Fuller, an ex-priest, and his son (Ernest Liu) and daughter (Juliette Lewis). Stopping to meet up with their cohorts at a bar, they discover that the bar is actually run by a group of nasty vampires.The problem with the film is that it takes a while to get going. Clooney is fun to watch, but this isn't the likable criminal that he usually plays. He's a violent thug, and ""charm"" is not something one would use to describe his character. QT however, is ineffective as Richard. He can be a genius filmmaker when he wants to be, but he can't act. Harvey Keitel is solid as the priest who lost his faith. Juliette Lewis is miscast, and the less said about Ernest Liu, the better (he's awful, if you must know).Robert Rodriguez is trying to emulate the B-grade zombie/vampire horror shlock films that he and QT love, and while it's certainly bloody, cheesy and sleazy, it's also a little boring. When the film gets going, it doesn't stop until the end. But it takes a little too long to get there.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
This flick is BIG !!!,"Those who haven't seen this yet, have missed something. I think it't just insulting to rate this movie with only 6.8 points!

Sweet Bloody Kisses..xx,"I absolutely love this film, every time it comes on T.V. It never tires me, it's always a joy to watch.This is a Vampire movie with an attitude, and humorous dialogue. George Clooney is not my favorite actor, but his performance is good in this one. Robert Roderiguez of the SPYkids movies directs this Horror Adventure.Seth Gecko (Clooney), and Richard Gecko (Tarantino) play Two Murderous Criminal Brothers on the run from the law, and their only chance of escape is moving to Mexico (a place that is now full of wanted people in the Movie world). To devise a quick route to their destination, they take hostages, a Trailer-travelling Family- Jacob Fuller (Keitel)as a preacher who lost his faith, his Son Scott Fuller (Liu), and his Daughter Kate (Lewis).The delusional Richard takes an obsessive interest in Kate and this distracts him from his duties. By luck they reach the Mexican border and force the Fuller family to go into a Strip bar called the TITTY TWISTER for a meeting of a crime boss.Santanico Pandemonium played by the sexy Salma Hayek (who is now playing Frida) does a belly dance and shows off her curves, I don't fancy girls, but somehow Salma doing that serpent dance made me twist my sexuality for 2 minutes. That is the most seductive scene in movie history, or of my History!!! And I don't mind watching it all over again.....and again.It's not long before the Gecko Brothers got themselves into trouble, as a result Richard's hand was shot and bloody, turning frenzied Salma into a lizard-like blood Sucker and attacked and bitten Richard, who becomes a vampire; Seth had to end his brother's life.Seth is angered and retailiates, by begging the survivors including the Fullers to fight for their lives, and the blood bath begins.They are fantastic one-lines coming from the Actors that flow more than the River Nile, for example Vampire Musicians were on stage, Sex machine (Savini) said to Frost (Williamson) 'let's kill that F****** Band' and the blood Sucking singer sticks a finger gesture 'F*** you and Good Night' *Kaboom* the band blows up. Kietel becomes a Preacher with attitude using a Crucifix-style Gun. Salma tells Seth that he will be her slave and pet dog, Seth replies with a gun 'No Thanks, I already had a Wife'. and the ending is bloody good. Pure Classic.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
A very fun movie with great CGI,"This movie was clearly made to have some fun. This is why I am not being too hard on it. But I got to say, I am a little disappointed seeing that Quentin Tarantino (the master of dialogue in my opinion) wrote this mediocre script.The direction by Robert Rodriguez is good enough for its purposes. The script, as I said, its pretty mediocre. The acting is pretty wooden by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino (although I must give him credit, I thought that he would f*ck up as an actor but he managed to be OK).The characters do not react as human beings and rather as movie characters.One aspect I really enjoyed about this movie is the CGI, which is really good, it seems like Robert Rodriguez took inspiration from Carpenter. Another aspect I enjoyed are two characters who are introduced later in the film who are totally bad*ss and really make this film an exciting ride.You may believe i didn't like the movie because of all of the problems I have stated, but I really had a blast with a really fun (and sexy) film, and I am giving it a 7/10 instead of a 6/10 for that very reason.It is a fun movie!

Up there with 'The Evil Dead' and 'Re-Animator',"'From Dusk 'Til Dawn' is one of the greatest exploitation movies of all time.As wild, creative and unique as any of the cult favourites of movie history, it has an extraordinary ability to cross genres. Gangster, road movie, action, horror, comedy... it's fitting that all of the lead characters are so different (preacher man, adolescent girl, Chinese boy, super-cool gangster, retarded killer... versus a bunch of vampires!)The key difference here is that movies with this kind of outrageous energy are usually zero-budget labours-of-love... whereas this one stars George Clooney, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis, and is scripted by one of the best writers in Hollywood.But this is the key point. Despite it's budget and cast list, this is STILL AN EXPLOITATION MOVIE! It's not a cross-over mainstream multi-plex hit like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs', this is genuine, anarchic, genre film-making.So if your favourite movie is the F***ING SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION or worse, Star Wars, then GO AWAY!

"Two different films, both great","The first half of film I so wish was a different film, the potential of what this film was going to be would have been one those excellent Tarantino films. The second half is very fun, very much a Rodriguez esque satire and is fun to watch. But it very much feels like two scripts joined halfway between. Both of which are great but I so wish I could see both films separately written. I'd never heard this film first time I saw it and didn't see the trailer. So when first believing I thought ""How could I have missed this Taranto classic"". Shortly come to go its a Rodriguez. It's a very good watch don't get me wrong.

It's Entertaining,"The movie opens up very nicely, which sets the the right tone for the movie. This is the typical Tarantino part,and man I really loved the opening act. But as time passes the story becomes wayward, it's like the humor didn't fuse well with the script. The twist doesn't come out properly. I would say the director was at fault here. The Final act was good, but the script was dilated by the direction and ends with God knows what kind of ending.Overall I would say the screenplay was really nice, the story was good enough but it is mainly the direction which did not make the film what it could have been. The music as always was good especially the song where Salma Hayek appears. Watch it for Tarantino.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Sewing machine,"There is no reason not to make a film which leaps abruptly from one genre to another. From Dusk Till Dawn leaps from the hard-boiled crime thriller to the gory vampire monster movie at the halfway mark, and does it so blatantly (seamlessly? I think not!!) that you can see the stitch marks.The reason why this genre-switching manoeuvre is not done more often is because, to anybody with any sense, it would appear that the result is not going to satisfy the enthusiasts of either genre and, given that the object of the exercise is bums on seats, maybe this is not the way to maximise the box office take.Of course, closer examination of those cases where genre-jumping has taken place - Moulin Rouge, Back to the Future 3 come to mind - the results have often been critically and commercially pleasing.In this case, I love the outrageous abandon with which the new genre is embraced. I don't care for the Tarantino character, and I don't care for the way the slightly less odious Clooney character shapes up as a kind of hero only by virtue of not being a vampire.But the ride is fun.And, even if it wasn't, the whole thing would be worth sitting through solely for the Santanico Pandemonium sequence - I would sell my children into slavery for the pleasure of sipping a good brandy from her navel (don't condemn me too readily: you haven't met my children!)",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Roadside nightmare,"There's something about mid-'90s George Clooney that hits different.

It mostly works for me, but even though I was never bored during the second half (with women and vampires), I kinda missed the earlier crime thriller moments.It's the little things I took to, like Cheech Marin popping up in three different roles, and Tom Savini clearly enjoying himself.

I don't believe that vampires are all romance, and although I can believe they come in different dispositions, this movie struck a chord of terror in me that goes back to the era of jumping off the bed in the middle of the night and running to the bathroom so whatever was lurking underneath couldn't grab a hold of your ankles. The setup was so sophisticated, so pat and so immersed in mundane obscenity, how could you possibly expect the evil to get so much more evil? This movie is somebody's nightmare--take it from someone who has been fascinated by the concept of vampires since they were a small child.

From dusk till yawn,"""From Dusk Till Dawn"" works as a thrill ride; if it were a rollercoaster, it'd be named the ""Vomit Comet.""  It also serves as a showcase for what was, at the time, the state of the art in makeup/splatter/morphing effects.  It falls short in most other respects.For one thing, its structure makes it almost two separate movies: before the Gecko brothers arrive at the Mexican bar, it's another Tarantino crime-spree road picture a la ""Natural Born Killers""; afterwards, it's ""Vamp"" meets ""Dawn of the Dead.""  Quentin Tarantino, who stars, opposite George Clooney, as the more unstable of the two criminal brothers, also scripted; evidently, he knows how to write action movies, but less about how to write vampire movies.  (Let alone horror movies, which are much more subtle than terror/action flicks.)As with all of Tarantino's works, this one is highly derivative.  In addition to ""Vamp"" (vampire strippers) and ""Dawn of the Dead"" (bikers vs. the undead, even going so far as to cast Tom Savini as one of the bikers!), FDTD features squirt guns full of holy water a la ""The Lost Boys""; has a character carve a cross into the tip of a bullet, which echoes both ""Curse of the Undead"" (a vampire Western of the late '50s!) and ""Taxi Driver""; mentions Peter Cushing by name; and product-places a character wearing a ""Precinct 13"" T-shirt.At one point the question arises as to whether anyone has actually read anything about vampires, or whether they're relying solely on movie knowledge: a fair question, and one that could be asked of Tarantino himself.  The refreshing possibility that maybe the story will adhere somewhat to actual folklore is sadly thrown away.  While certain folkloric traditions have it that vampirism is contagious, it's never described as incubating within minutes, as happens here.  And of course, the film's vampire peril ends when sunlight obliterates them--an enduringly popular movie device, although folkloric vampires aren't harmed by sunlight at all. (Neither are certain classic literary vampires, including both Carmilla and Count Dracula.)Then there's the cast.  OH, dear.  Much as I like Harvey Keitel, he's incredibly miscast as a Baptist preacher!  True, the character's pastoral days are behind him, since he's embittered over the death of his wife; still, putting Mr. Keitel in a white shirt, a pair of horn-rimmed specs, and a dorky straw hat doesn't make a credible preacher out of him.  Nor does it help that his character is so shallowly written: it's unconvincing that a man his age, who'd evidently been pastoring for some years, would completely blow off God on the basis of a garden-variety family tragedy.  I would have accepted that he'd take a long sabbatical, a road trip with his kids, to clear his head and to come to terms with his loss--probably with a well-thumbed copy of C. S. Lewis' ""A Grief Observed"" close at hand.  The character's sketchiness isn't surprising, though, given the evident lack of research on Tarantino's part: with millions of Baptists in the U.S., you'd think he could've easily found out that Baptists don't make the sign of the cross OR use holy water!  This is just another example of how out of touch Hollywood is with ordinary American life.As Harvey's daughter, Juliette Lewis plays EXACTLY the same character she played in ""Cape Fear"" and ""Kalifornia"": the teenager of budding sexuality. I'm not a big fan of hers to begin with, but I REALLY don't get how she landed all these ""sexy"" roles.  She's an OK actress, but if I had a dog that looked like that, I'd shave his butt and make him walk backwards.  I'd have loved to see Natalie Portman in this role instead.Didn't catch the name of the black actor who plays the Nam vet; he's good, but again, his material is cheesy.  When, during a lull in the action, he lights a cigar and begins a tale with the words, ""I was in Nam,"" the audience I saw the movie with LAUGHED!  As Harvey's adopted son, Ernest Liu looks appropriately bewildered--almost as overwhelmed as he must have been in real life, making his film debut in the company of Tarantino, Keitel, and Lewis.  Salma Hayek plays Satanica Pandemonia--white snake and all!--the sort of role that might once have been played by Caroline Munro.  And Cheech Marin plays three roles--adequately, but Peter Sellers he ain't.All told, FDTD is a flashy but foul bit of fun, a trove of cliches culled from other (and better) vampire and action flicks.  Regrettably, it contributes--along with stuff like ""Bordello of Blood,"" ""John Carpenter's Vampires,"" etc.--to the the ongoing trivialization of vampire films.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

it can become a little waring,"The script is good, the direction spot on and the performances from Harvey Keitel, George Clooney, even Quentin Tarantino and particularly Juliette Lewis, are excellent. Its just that however tight and exciting the first part is and however daring and innovative and special those special effects are, things could do with a little trim towards the end. I can imagine how excited everybody involved was at the chance to create every sort of vampiric being and then have them die in all the ways we have ever seen and then some. But, it can become a little waring, there is such a thing as overkill and for the viewer, who is not drunk or drugged, there is just too much. It is a shame because not only is the first half so good but the whole idea of the biker bar, strippers and vampires also good, even if a little reminiscent of Vamp, featuring Grace Jones as the mistress of ceremonies.

The director doesn't have the skill of the screenwriter, and the screenwriter seemed more interested in getting his big face on film.Amusing gore, but the comedy beats are off and the pace drags.

I bet most of the ones who call these guys the Sexiest Men Alive wouldn't even date these very guys.  Oh, yes, we are a land of substance and honesty and character.  Anyway, Clooney seemed boring and a push-over to me before, but in this movie, he kicks butt.  The whole movie kicks butt.

From Dusk Till Dawn is exactly what is purports to be; a fun action packed thriller.,"Like most Tarantino-inspired films, From Dusk Till Dawn is exactly what it purports to be, which is good because there is nothing worse than a pretentious, enigmatic film that leaves you with more questions than answers. This comical, action-packed thriller satisfies not only with action, thrills and gore, but also satire, which is to be expected of both Tarantino and Rodriguez.The acting isn't phenomenal but it isn't suppose to be. The characters, especially Clooney's, are both likable, and detestable, and together, notwithstanding their differences, form a dysfunctional, yet effective whole that band together to combat a legion of ghastly ghouls yearning for human blood.If you're after a film that'll induce awe, or leave you feeling a better â or worse â person, then From Dusk Till Dawn isn't for you.

Lots of bangs and lots of fangs!,"It was only during my fifteenth â or so â viewing of ""From Dusk till Dawn"" that I realized that I've never written a user comment for this film. Now that's a quick win! Along with all the other movies Quentin Tarantino was ever involved in, I love every repeated viewing of this film and I say all the characters' lines simultaneously with them. Even now, nearly 20 years after its first release, it still qualifies as one of the most successful crossbreeds between action/thriller and my beloved horror genre, and the film still stands proud and solid thanks to the fast-paced script, the fabulous dialogs, the terrific acting performances and â of course â the excessive use of gore and bloodshed! ""From Dusk till Dawn"" starts out as a wild gangster/chase movie, with George Clooney (back when he was still desperately trying to get rid of his goody- two-shoes ""ER"" reputation) and QT himself as the violent and unhinged Gecko brothers on the run for State Troopers, Texas Rangers and all other various sorts of authorities. They hijack former preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his teenage daughter and adopted son, who're road-tripping in their motorhome in order to process the loss of their wife and mother. Hidden inside the motorhome Seth and Ritchie Gecko cross the Mexican border and immediately head towards an exclusive bar called the Titty Twister. The film then halfway transforms, totally unexpectedly and unpredictable (at least the first time), into an outrageous splatter flick as it turns out that the staff and regular customers of this particular bar turn out to be vampires feeding on passing truckers and bikers. This may sound stupid and far-fetched, but in Tarantino's script it works wonderfully well and the battle between fugitive gangsters and wicked bloodsuckers is spectacular as well as funny and even suspenseful. The film is chock-full of references towards classic horror films, and particularly vampire classics obviously, and stars a handful of nearly-forgotten genre icons in small supportive roles. There's a lovely little role for Blaxploitation hero Fred Williamson, as a tough vampire killer, and a (sadly too short) cameo appearance by John Saxon. Make-up genius Tom Savino clearly also terrifically enjoyed himself as a dressed in leather biker by the nickname Sex Machine. The direction is in the hands of Tarantino's equally gifted pal Robert Rodriguez, who also invited his buddies Cheech Marin, Danny Trejo and Salma Hayek. The latter's sensual dance on top of the bar tables, just prior to hell breaking loose, is definitely also one of the highlights of the film. ""From Dusk till Dawn"" is highly recommended entertainment that I'll undoubtedly watch countless times more.

But I know it's mentioned quite a bit because of the Quentin Tarantino fans out there, so when I came across the film in Hollywood Video, I didn't hesitate. Also not to mention that we have a few stars in the film besides Quentin, we have George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, and Juliette Lewis. So I just watched the film and while I think the story had a complete turn around, we went from a hostage/robbers story to a vampire horror story. It happened so quickly that I was a bit out of it after the film, but at the same time I really enjoyed the action. It was unbelievable, I'm not just talking about the vampires alone, I'm just saying how the family knew automatically to use weapons. Well, there are a few things, but I'll explain in a minute.Seth and Richie are two brothers who are robbers and killers, they are on the run to Mexico. They kidnap a family with their motor home van and cross the border. There Seth wants to meet a friend that can get him started with the money that him and his brother robbed from a bank, they decide to meet at the local strip club that is open from dusk till dawn. There Seth, Richie, the family end up getting something a bit out of their league and what they expected, vampires, and they're hungry for some blood.The acting is alright, enough to get by as believable, I mean, don't get me wrong, the cast was awesome, but it was a bit of a question to me on the roles they took on. While the story is very cool and creative, like I said, it turns so quickly into something else and they also leave with questions. This wasn't Quentin's best work, but I liked this movie better than Jackie Brown. I would recommend this movie for horror fans, because I know every Quentin Tarantino fan has already seen this film. But it's a cool movie, just I know that it could have either ended better or answered a few more questions.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Absolutely Hilarious,"A film that holds nothing back.At the beginning of the film, we follow the criminal brothers, Seth Gecko and Richard Gecko, who are on the run from the law in the direction of Mexico.Along the way, they force the family, Father, son and daughter, to transport them across the border into Mexico. Once there, they head to a bar called Titty Twister.The movie is fun and interesting, with lots of action. The action is deliberately exaggerated, brutal to the point of being grotesque and comical.George Clooney plays Seth Gecko, who is actually a lot more reserved than his brother, Richard. Richard is a total psychopath and in a way, the opposite of Seth, who has some redeeming qualities.Tarantino is a good choice for the character of Richard, he did quite well in this role. There are a lot of fun characters in the movie, Tom Savini is hilarious as the Sex Machine, and Danny Trejo is always fun, as is Cheech Marin, who plays several characters in the movie.Fred Williamson is excellent, as are Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis. Salma Hayek, who plays Santanico Pandemonium, is always a good addition to any movie.Action, hilarious characters, grotesque violence to the point of comedy and vampires. Yes, vampires. It's all there in this movie.A film that is definitely worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Messed up, but fun!","First thing you need to know before watching From Dusk Till Dawn is that it is a B movie. It is made that way. It's one of those movies that need to be crappy in a certain way. All the vampires look really shitty. It just makes them gross, which is all part of the fun.While the TV show tells the audience a lot more about the whole thing and several people stay alive, the film also shares some of the strengths of the show. One of them how thrilling few scenes are, and you are not sure who to root for. To be honest, in the TV show there were more parties to root for than in the film, but still, same feeling.The cast of this film is really weird in a way. Clooney and Tarantino playing brothers? How would that ever be believable? Well, it seems alright, because the two work really well together.From Dusk Till Dawn is really messed up, but it is also so much fun, as Rodriguez' movies usually are.

From dusk till dawn,"It's like watching two unparalleled films.It's strange to see such a classic crime movie transition into a fantastical, gore feast, and honestly it somehow works out to be a great film. From the plot to the acting this film is just a pleasure to watch, it keeps you intrigued and flips your whole world upside down later in the film. Ir has brilliant cinematography with vivid and atmospheric props, costumes and character design. However the start was rather slow and disengaging, it does introduce the characters well but could've been a bit more creative and engaging.

Its a fun ride throughout and generally seems to have the right idea about making a film like this, don't take it seriously! With Rodgriguez at the helm it would've been hard to achieve a serious film anyway.Tarantino gives a surprisingly decent performance and isn't doomed to give the kind of acting that directors, singers and models usually give. Clooney steals the show completely and is fantastic as a relentlessly professional criminal/thief.This one really is NSFW, with profanity in almost every single sentence and themes of sexual violence, murder and general demonic possession throughout. The ending is one of the most fascinating play ons for a sequel I've seen in a film and slightly alters the tone from fun to actually quite creepy.

Rarely am I moved to submit a review ...,"... but on this occassion, I just couldn't resist.Within just a few minutes, I felt uncomfortable with this film. Like most films in which Tarantino is involved, everything was predictable. Some people have referred to this film as fun. Yawn. The gratuitous violence is just so dull and I often wonder if Tarantino and Rodriguez are actually pitching this trash at the sub 15 year old market, despite its inevitable censorship classification. If adults are truly enjoying this type of trash, then we are in big trouble.This movie came across as a poor short story that couldn't/wouldn't go anywhere and so a vampire thing was tacked on to make up time. But still no story.I suspect that Harvey Keitel may regret being involved in this film. As most know, he has proved his skill and talent as an actor on many occassion, but why did he get involved in this? I must confess that I would have been surprised if Juliette Lewis wasn't involved in this. This is just her thing. Maybe there is some talent there, but who would know? George Clooney may well be challenging Kevin Costner as the planet's most boring actor. He is as convincing as your average politician and I'm sure that I won't even notice that he has stopped working, or has he already? Some have also suggested that if one enjoyed this film, Natural Born Killers should be high on one's list. Sorry. Impossible. Natural Born Killers was warning us of our bad habits in allowing manipulative media into our homes. From Dusk Till Dawn offers, well, nothing but wooden actors (except for Mr Keitel) and rubbery parts splattered in Hollywood ketchup. Truly a stinker. 0.1 out of ten, and it was only Harvey who got it that high.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"psychos do not explode when sunlight hits them, I don't give a f*** how crazy they are!","Cool! Bad Ass! Awesome! I use these words to describe FROM DUSK TILL DAWN. This movie was cool, bad ass, and awesome. I thought it was a good change in pace for vampire movies, and action movies in general. I think only a few directors can make an action movie work while being confined in some what small surroundings, and they are Robert Rodriguiz, Quinten Tarantino, and John Carpenter.There were great actors in this, including George Clooney (he was a bad ass in this, and most of his movies in general), Harvey Keitel (who is also a bad ass, but in this he's more of the bad ass farther type), and the always bad ass Juilette Lewis (need I say more).I certainly cannot recommend this to every one. But for those who don't mind strippers dancing one minute and decimating a guy's face and throat the next, a lot of profanity, crude weapons (including a jack-hammer with a stake on the end), bikers, bat/vampires, and bad asses with guns, than this could be your cup of tea. 8/10",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Two parts,"It feels like the film is divided into two parts: the first part progresses realistically without any hint of fantasy, but in the second part, completely unexpected things happen, surprising the audience. The fact that there are no hints in the first part and then suddenly encountering these elements creates a nice sense of fantasy and mystery within me. The film is worth watching just for this reason, as I can't recall any other film with such a drastic shift.This is the first film in the series that I've watched, and I haven't seen the show either, but I must say I liked it.

"I don't know how this gets better with age, but it does.","From Dusk Till Dawn is the sort of movie I thought I'd like less the older I got, but the opposite's been true. I think I first watched this at 15, and thought it was a mess. Watched it a few years on from that, and I thought it was still messy, but it was a bit easier to appreciate and less overwhelming/strange an experience. Now, another decade on, it's more chaotic than I remembered but it's also so much fun. Knowing the direction it goes in kind of makes it more fun. It's such a good film to show people who've never heard of it before, a bit like One Cut of the Dead or The Cabin in the Woods.It helped that Quentin Tarantino was in this less than I remembered, and even then, this is still probably the best (or at least most consistent) performance he's given to date. That's not saying a great deal, but it's something. Thankfully, George Clooney is genuinely great here, and perfectly understood the wild assignment at hand. The supporting cast is also fantastic, with Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin, Fred Williamson, and Tom Savini all being hilarious at different points.It's such a grim and unpleasant movie, then it becomes ridiculous, and then it becomes a bloodbath. It's absolute nonsense, but it's also so much fun. Other films have tried to be anarchic blends of comedy, horror, action, and thriller genres before, and haven't pulled it off nearly as well. I think watching From Dusk Till Dawn the first time, it felt new (as far as genre blends went) but it also felt messy. Now, I've seen much messier, and I feel like I was wrong to ever think of this one as messy in a bad way.It is still messy, but it's my kind of messy. This movie makes me feel bad and feel good at the same time. I'm glad it exists, and also happy to find it seems to get better with age, even as I purportedly grow older and more mature. I watched this not in a great mood, too, and it still managed to raise my spirits, so that's a sign of good entertainment, I think.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
I like most of this fun horror/comedy/thriller,"I got From Dusk Till Dawn at a used DVD store for two bucks, and it was a good deal. This is really a mesh between a Quentin Tarantino crime picture and a Robert Rodriguez horror film.The first half involves Tarantino and George Clooney as Richard and Seth Gecko trying to get into Mexico and away from the FBI and the Texas Rangers since Richard broke Seth out of jail, helped him rob a bank and spilled a considerable amount of blood doing so. They kidnap Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis and first-timer Ernest Liu) and use their RV to get across the border. When over the border they go to the Titty Twister, a rowdy bar for bikers and truckers, where Richard and Seth plan on meeting their friend Carlos, sometime between dusk and dawn, so they can give him a cut of their loot. Little do they know, the Titty Twister is a front for a group of vampires who prey on unsuspecting truckers and bikers.From Dusk Till Dawn is a violent, campy, and mostly entertaining movie. Tarantino wrote the screenplay and does a stellar job as Richard Gecko, and Rodriguez directed it which makes it feel a bit like Desperado and Pulp Fiction thrown together with some campy horror.The main things I liked about this movie were the actors. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino are really convincing as two criminal brothers. When Seth finds the dead, raped body of a woman who was supposed to be their hostage, he asks Seth if it's his fault and if he (Richard) thinks that's what he (Seth) is like. I also liked Harvey Kietel as a minister who seems to have lost his faith and Juliette Lewis, who I usually find annoying, as his daughter. Plus, Salma Hayek is ultra-sexy as an exotic dancer.I preferred the first half of the movie to the semi-campy gore-invested second half. The vampires look like a cross between zombies and vampires, which I don't think works very well, and the special effects are obviously fairly low budget, plus I'm not a huge gory-horror movie fan. While the effects are fairly cheesy, I got the feeling they weren't supposed to look very real anyway since their are a lot of jokes and visual gags. A group talk about ways to kill vampires is amusing and pokes fun at vampire movie clichÃ©s and Juliette Lewis has a funny scene where she is unsure about stabbing a possibly bitten trucker.Overall I'd give From Dusk Till Dawn seven stars of of ten, it's a entertaining movie with some fun performances and an original story, but the effects are awkward since it's hard to tell whether they are purposely cheesy or just low budget. Check it out if you get the chance.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Sleek, smart and very funny nocturnal adventure","What to say about a film that does so much during it's running time, and should satisfy so many different moviegoers? Director Robert Rodriguez manages to combine a blnear flawless script with a smartly casted roster and creates a true evergreen, and one of the best moviegoing experiences of the 1990s. Criminal brothers Richard and Seth Gecko kidnap a former pastor and his two teenage children in an effort to cross the Mexican border using their RV. When they get to Mexico, they are told to wait the night until meeting with druglord Carlos the next morning, escorting the brothers to their safety in El Rey. Well, the film is all about what happens that night, and it doesn't take long for the brothers and their hostages to realize something is very peculiar at this particular bar. Breakout roles for George Clooney and Salma Hayek as the dancer Satanico Pandemonium. Feed Williamson, Tom Savini, and Danny Trejo have tremendous roles as bar patrons, and the fun and action is almost nonstop. A rare film that works, functionally, in every level; and even those it's based upon cheesy grind house pictures of the ditectors' youth, the sheer exuberance of the film should make it enjoyable for even the pickiest moviegoers.

A good Halloween monster flick and has a solid Clooney performance. I have to say that this is actually a good movie although it does lose it's way towards the end.

Never a dull moment,"After seeing it's explosive opening (pun intended), I knew that From Dusk Till Dawn would not be your average thriller.

I am not saying Rodriguez did a bad job, just that maybe the film would have come together as something more with Tarantino behind the camera. Of course, the turn of events in the 2nd half would have been surprising had Dish Network not spoiled it in the summary info. But it didn't matter, I was hooked throughout. From the Tarantino scripts, this IS his weakest, but it doesn't matter. It's a blast to old gory cheesy horrors!

It truly deserves its cult status after 25 years,"I was always curious about this movie as it has been quoted by many famous movie critics and it's considered a cult movie from the 1990s. And it's also famous because it was George Clooney's first major movie (at the time he only did a few minor ones and was famous for the TV show ER). And after I saw it four months ago I had to agree with everyone that considers it a classic and a cult movie since I loved it very much.The movie begins with brothers Seth and Richard Gecko (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) that are bank robbers and in the beginning they blow with explosives an entire liquor store. Since the entire state of Texas and the FBI are after them they don't have any other choice than reach the Mexican Border. So they casually meet Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and force him to go in their motor home along with his kids Scott and Kate (Ernest Liu and Juliette Lewis). After some road they go to a night club called the Titty Twister. After the sun goes down the leads find out that everyone who works there is a vampire that feeds on bikers and truckers' blood. The Geckos and Fullers join forces with a guy known as S** Machine (Tom Savini) and a black guy named Frost (Fred Williamson) and they face vampires as their opponents.This movie is actually two movies in one. In the first half is a crime movie and then the movie shifts to an horror comedy. If you take this change not too serious, as the way it comes, you will appreciate it very much. And the horror is not that gory, so even non horror fans can like this movie without being disgusted.The acting is pretty good by everyone. Clooney, Tarantino and Keitel are all good together as also a very young Juliette Lewis. The movie is filled with supporting roles and even cameos by many famous faces of those years: Marc Lawrence as an old timer in an hotel, John Hawkes (who a year later played a mugger in STEEL with Shaquille O'Neal), Kelly Preston and John Saxon in the news reports scene (who quite coincidentally passed away in the same month of the same year), Salma Hayek in her first major American movie, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini, Michael Parks and the always great Danny Trejo that as always gives one of his usual remarkable performances.This is quite a funny, intelligent and original vampire movie.

"Grisly, goofy fun","The Geckos, couple of desperado brothers (Clooney and Tarantino) and the family that thay have taken hostage end up in an ultra-sleezy Mexican stripper-bar that is also a den of the undead, so blood (red and green) is spilled by the bucket as the desperate group tries to live out the titular period. The violence is so over-the-top that it floats above the offensively objectionable and lodges firmly into the ludicrously entertaining. The film starts slowly: it takes the Geckos 45 minutes shoot up a liquor store, grab their hostages, and cross the border, but once they are unsafely ensconced in the ""Titty Twister"", the action sequences (preposterous even by fantasy-bloodbath standards) are nonstop and sanguinely amusing. The cast, which includes Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Cheech Marin (in multiple roles), and Danny Trejo is great, as is Robert Rodriguez's direction, and the script (by Tarantino) is profane and comical. The plot's a sieve and there are endless inconsistencies in the vampire life (death?) cycle, but this is not a story-driven film by any stretch of the imagination, so who cares.

I remember hearing a lot of hype about this film back when it first came out in 96', and even though I am a avid horror fan, I just got around to seeing the movie now. I honestly don't know what to think of this filmÂthe first half is a Quentin Tarantino-style crime romp, with his usual trademark sense of off-beat humor. Then the second half of the film: Blood, gore, monsters, blood, gore, monsters, more blood, gore, monstersÂI think you get the picture.It's certainly enjoyable and funny in that the characters, Tarantino's especially, are funny and likable, and the script, penned by Tarantino himself, is witty, clever and often imaginative. The actors all do a great job too; I loved Harvey Keitel's dead-pan delivery and Mr. Clooney is his usual sly self.Then, of course we have what the film was designed forÂthe gore and monsters. The boys at KNB effects deserve a pat on the back for they're contribution here. The creature effects were great and the gore was over-the-top but convincing and plentiful as hell. Unfortunately, this film was made during the digital boom so some pretty lame ""morphing"" effects were employed for the scenes where vampires melt after being killed, but this is only a small complaint.If you like gore or off-beat horror films, you'll probably enjoy this film, just remember to turn your brain off before watching it.

Adore this Film!,"Review:
'From Dusk Till Dawn' is an action horror film directed by Robert Rodriguez.
This is just a fun filled movie from start to finish. It's by far one of my favorite George Clooney movies, and the story is so damn entertaining.
Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his younger brother Richard (Quentin Tarantino) are on the run after a bloody bank robbery in Texas. They escape across the border into Mexico and will be home-free the next morning, when they pay off the local kingpin. They just have to survive from dusk till dawn at the rendezvous point, which turns out to be a strip joint run by vampires.
The acting is very effective, with George Clooney carrying the film. Tarantino is average, but he was certainly having fun with the role. Keitel is terrific as always and is perfect as the faithless pastor who doesn't trust in God anymore. I was pretty impressed given the type of movie I was watching.
The first half has less action, but tension does mount between Keitel and Clooney, while Tarantino is in the back, paying special attention to Keitel's daughter. The script is witty and full of dark humour, and the intro is certainly one of the best in movie history. The characters are well established, with Clooney as the straightforward bad guy, while Tarantino is his psychotic brother. You know exactly what your getting into with these characters. Rodriguez has always done films to have fun, and this is what has set him apart from other filmmakers.
Overall, this is another fun filled horror movie. It doesn't take itself too seriously and isn't afraid to be silly at times. It showed great characters with great actors portraying them. I totally recommend this movie to all vampire lovers.

Keitel is good in his role, as well as Clooney who gives one of his better performances. Tarantino was horrible in his acting, but Juliette Lewis was refreshing, as were supporting actors Marin and Trejo who are favorites of mine from other rodriguez flicks (marin from cheech and chong).

Among the best of its kind,"When I hear the words campy horror, a specific handful of names come to mind. One of them is Rodriguez and Tarantino's From Dusk Till Dawn.

Once you watch it, you'll know what I mean. If this is your thing and you haven't seen this flick yet, you really and truly should.It is a ""hot God damn day"" in Big Springs, Texas when the movie starts, Seth and Richard Gecko, are the most notorious bandits in the state and are responsible for the deaths of a good twenty people (both cops and civilians) After blowing up a liqueur store in scene one, they know they have to get over the border before the FBI get them (the Mexican border that is, not the Canadian). The Gecko Bros highjack a retired priest and his family who have a big RV, and devise a plan to get across. After they do, the gang heads for a bar with the degrading name ""Titty Twister"". It is inconveniently in the middle of nowhere. There they plan to have a night of drinking and parting, but all is not as it seems. All the staff and dancers turn out to be vampires, and in a few moments of extreme gore they kill everyone but our heroes and a couple of bikers. Can our gang survive the remainder of the night, fighting back with what little means they have?I did a lot of research on the movie before I saw it. All sources say that this is the goriest film in modern cinema. In a way it is, but Robert Rodriguez has a couple of tricks up his sleeve. He makes the gore look intentionally unrealistic (ex. Green blood, lots of goo) because if it looked to convincing, the MPAA might give the film an NC-17 rating or perhaps even ban it from theatres. Regardless, From Dusk Till Dawn is still pretty gross but it is not vomit provoking (unless of course this is your first movie).There are a lot of other things to say about From Dusk till Dawn, many of them good, but a few which are not so good. Regardless, it is not one to be missed. As Rodriguez says, it is a good film to get drunk on with friends at night, just don't make it a date movie.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
From Dusk Till Dawn,"So ""Seth"" (George Clooney) and his nasty brother ""Richard"" (Quentin Tarantino) leave a trail of death and mayhem as they head to the safety of Mexico after robbing a bank then trashing a convenience store and a motel! Close to the border, they abduct a pastor ""Jacob"" (Harvey Keitel) and his family and use them to slip un-noticed across the border before heading to a lively brothel ""Titty Twister"". Once there, and suitably tanked up with booze, they discover that there is something distinctly fishy (and it's not just with the stockings) as darkness descends and the clientele, well let's just say they get hungry... What now ensues is a bloodbath worth of any Hammer film - and frankly, it's of about the same standard. Tarantino may well be formidable behind the camera, but in from of it he is hopeless. Clooney fares a little better but it's really only Keitel who manages to keep this increasingly farcical film moving along for what seems like an age. I found what passed for humour to be pretty vulgar and tawdry and to be honest, I was rather bored with the relentlessness and repetition of the whole thing one we had got past the obligatory violent stages of the plot development. Was it supposed to be a comedy? You tell me - but either way, I won't bother watching it again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Don't read the synopsis!,"Do not read the synopsis or any other information about this film before you watch it. I picked it up on video when it first came out, not having a clue what it was about or what to expect, but purely because E.R. was at its peak and I fancied George. The front cover gave nothing away, so when I got half way through what was an ok film and it all started to kick off in a way that I had never even thought of, I was very pleasantly surprised.That is the turning point of this film, and you can't miss it. It's where, if you're not enjoying it, you need to stick with it until then and if it doesn't change your mind after it all changes, it's not for you.With regards to the cast-
I personally can't stand Quentin Tarantino, although his films are generally very well made, most of them don't fit my needs, but as an actor he just irritates the hell out of me and I want to do horrible and violent things to his weird face, which is really odd for me as a pacifist. He is just about bearable in this one as that is the type of character he is playing.George, however, is incredibly handsome and there are other things I'd like to do to his face, we won't get in to that, but they're not violent. He is actually very good in the bad boy role and I'd like to see more films with him like that. He's great as a romantic lead, but something about him in this film is just very enjoyable to watch.
It's quite funny and almost like a role reversal to see Harvey Keitel playing a man of the cloth and, as with George, he does a great job too.The supporting cast are all generally a bunch of B movie stars that fit perfectly in what can only be described as an hilariously bad film. And that's where the twist comes in and I refuse to spoil it for you, but it's brilliant in its cheesy, terrible way.I don't know if it was the channel I was watching it on, but the sound was terrible, I had to keep turning it up and down. Other than that, there's not much to moan about. There is some blood and gore, but it's almost comedic in it's over the top presentation.I really like this one and would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"A high energy horror/crime genre mashup with Tarantino's wit, Rodriguez' energy, and an engaging ensemble making for a thrilling ride.","Set in South Texas, bank robbers the Gecko Brothers, level headed Seth (George Clooney) and unstable wild card Richie (Quentin Tarantino), are on the run from the law following Seth's escape from prison orchestrated by Richie with the two having robbed a bank and killed several police officers leading to a statewide manhunt. Seth and Richie are intent on crossing the boarder into Mexico to meet their contact for safe passage to El Rey, but the boarder guards will be on the lookout. The Geckos have a chance encounter with the Fuller family in an RV consisting of widowed former pastor Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and his son and daughter Scott (Ernest Liu) and Katherine (Juliette Lewis). The Gecko brothers take the family hostage intent on using them and their RV to smuggle themselves across the border, and Jacob reluctantly acquiesces to their demands. Upon entry into Mexico the group set off to the Gecko's rendezvous point with their contact at low rent biker/trucker bar and strip club the Titty Twister. However once there the Geckos and Fullers find themselves in a fight for their lives as it turns out the bar is actually a front for vampires.The initial idea for From Dusk till Dawn came from noted effects/make-up artist Robert Kurtzman of the legendary special effects group KNB EFX Group. Kurtzman hired pre-Reservoir Dogs Quentin Tarantino to write the scrip based on his initial idea which became Tarantino's first paid writing assignment allowing him to quit his day job. The script wouldn't be made for a few years as it floated around Hollywood with Universal Pictures at one point interested in making it a second Tales from the Crypt film to follow on Demon Night before ultimately deciding to produce a different vampire story with Bordello of Blood. Tarantino had become friends with another up and coming high energy director Robert Rodriguez and mentioned the script and Rodriguez agreed to direct provided Tarantino would re-write it. The fact that Tarantino's work on films such as Natural Born Killers and the ever endearing Pulp Fiction had worked its way into the pop cultural zeitgeist of the 90s was no doubt instrumental in getting the film off the ground as Miramax was no doubt eager to tap into that same energy that made Pulp Fiction so successful. Upon release the film received mixed but mainly positive reviews with many critics enjoying the rich characterizations in the first half, but generally dividing on the dive into Grindhouse excess in the second half where it becomes a showcase for action and special effects. The film has gone on to become a cult film of the 90s inspiring two inferior direct to video sequels and a reimagined TV series by Rodriguez and it shows how much the film has endeared itself. While you can probably poke holes in the film, the movie is all about creative and fast paced excess and earns the right to a few holes, both in story and made with bullets in vampires.From the memorable opening scene at Benny's World of Liquor featuring the first appearance of Michael Parks' Texas Ranger Earl McGraw character, the movie sets itself up as a white knuckle hair trigger ride where no one is safe as McGraw seems like he's being positioned as a Frank Hamer-esque lawman who's going to be our protagonist only for the movie to subvert expectations and have this imposing and charismatic lawman who'd be the hero in any other movie snubbed out in the blink of an eye. This establishes a rhythm of the movie wherein we're giving scenes of tension broken up by shocking violence but it uses the violence with purpose as psychotic tendencies of Richie are often at odds with the more precise and methodical Seth who tries to avoid violence and tends to prefer using the threat of violence more than actually using violence to get what he wants or needs. The Fuller family are also an engaging set of characters with Harvey Keitel's take on Jacob Fuller as a pastor who's lost his faith with the death of his wife carrying a quiet sadness that's counterbalanced by his drive to protect his children. Both Lewis and Liu are good as Jacob's daughter and son respectively, though Liu does unfortunately sometimes feel like he's brush aside as he doesn't really get to make that much of an impression with most of the best character pieces going to Lewis.The second half of the film is where a lot of critics tended to spit back in the day and to a degree I can understand their gripes as the movie as a road crime movie was working quite well, but with the Earl McGraw scene that starts off the film as the opening sequence it does kind of prep the audience for having the rug yanked out from under them so in my opinion it earns the genre switch. Once we get the switch to vampire/action/horror/siege it becomes an excuse for the filmmakers to dive into their love letter writing to their favorite B/exploitation classics of the 70s and 80s with clear allusions to things like Assault on Precinct 13 (Scott Fuller even wears a ""Precinct 13"" shirt throughout the film), special effects legend Tom Savini gets to play a badass biker named Sex Machine who carries a whip and a special cod piece that makes a gun pop out (guess what the gun looks like?), and blaxploitation legend Fred Williamson gets to dive into his old action persona including indulging in the trope of the ""back in 'Nam"" speech that's part and parcel to many an action exercise. The effects work provided by KNB EFX Group is needless to say bloody good with both the regular shootouts in the first half and the over the top Titty Twister bloodbath in the second half both solidly good for wildly different reasons. Every one of these vampires is lovingly constructed and it is pure joy to see them explode or melt into goo. Yes there are certain contrivance to make the movie get to this point, I still couldn't answer exactly why Seth wants the Geckos to stay with him after they get to the Titty Twister but I'm willing to cut the film some leeway on that one.From Dusk Till Dawn has deservedly become a cult classic thanks to its mashup of Tarantino wit mix with Rodriguez' high energy action packed excess. The cast is a solid ensemble with even brief walk-ons from John Saxon and Kelly Preston used to good effect, and an ensemble of leads who are charismatic and intriguing. The movie has shown remarkable staying power despite originally being dumped in the January movie graveyard of 1996, and thankfully its legacy continues to endure.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (Robert Rodriguez, 1996) **1/2","This is another film I'd been wanting to watch ever since it was released. As some of you may know, I'm not much of a devotee of Quentin Tarantino - even less so Robert Rodriguez - and my main interest in it was to see how they approached the horror genre. I wasn't all that surprised to find that it's much more of a Tarantino/Rodriguez hybrid of cool dialogue, excessive violence, foul language and slam-bang action than an out-and-out vampire film!Anyway, the first half (which is the non-horror part, incidentally) is the best with George Clooney and Tarantino himself (still a worthless actor and mean as mush) on the run after a heist and kidnapping Harvey Keitel's preacher and family on their way to Mexico. When we finally get to the vampires, it's like the film-makers didn't quite know what to make of them and wanted to get it over with - as we only see a succession of humans getting bitten and transformed into the undead themselves, until dawn arrives and the vampires left standing are destroyed by sunlight.Tarantino gets to wear monster make-up and an embarrassed-looking Harvey Keitel dabbles in gung-ho action heroics - but this section does feature a delightful double-act in fx master Tom Savini (playing a character called ""Sex Machine"" and decked-out with a cannon device in his pants placed on top of his crotch!) and former 'Blaxpoitation' star Fred Williamson. For the record, Clooney is likable as ever, Juliette Lewis does her typically confused yet aroused teenager, while Salma Hayek is a sultry snake dancer billed as ""Santanico {sic} Pandemonium"" (but her appearance is much shorter than I had anticipated, given the prominence she is given in stills I had seen from the film!).",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Two in one,"This movie can be seen in two ways i guess. The first way is to see it and not think, in which case you can just look at it as an entertaining vampire-flick. The other way to look at it is to think a little and realize that this is really two movies in one.The movie starts out quite slow and somber. Two brothers are on the run from the law, having broken out of prison and leaving a trail of dead police officers behind them. They are heading toward the Mexican border at top speed. Their paths cross with a family consisting of a father and his two children. Thinking that it would be easier to cross the border in a motor home with a family the brothers take them hostage.For about half the movie this is not so different from what you would expect from Tarantino. Some quite funny dialog, George Clooney as the foul-mouthed hard-case. And Harvey Keitel as the world-weary preacher being taken hostage. Then the other half of the movie changes style completely. From a rather comfy thriller of sorts it erupts into a splatter-filled vampire-flick. And i guess this is where many people start having trouble with this movie.However, i must confess i really like this movie. In forging these two styles together Robert Rodriguez shows that he has the fingertip-feel needed to balance them out. While there is certainly a lot of gore the comedy never leaves the movie. I found myself sitting with a more or less constant smile on my face throughout. Sometimes, in very rare cases, the sum of the parts are bigger than the whole so to speak. And this is such a case. I rate this 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

"Richie, would you do me a favour and eat my p*s*y for me...please?","The film 'From Dusk till Dawn' is a fantastic film for the excellent choice of actors, great soundtrack and extreme storyline made this film into a one of a kind. I can understand, however, a person not liking this film, but in order to appreciate this film you have to have the right mindset. By doing so you must realise that you can't take this film seriously and that its just another typical black horror Robert Rodriguez/Quentin Tarentino film. What I love about this film is how extreme the storyline changes on how an ordinary family gets kidnapped by wanted criminals, Seth Gecko(George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) and is forced by these criminals to smuggle them in their camper-van over the Mexican border and how the story changes from that to blood sucking vampires killing everybody in the Mexican biker nightclub. I quite like this style of directing for the director Stanley Kubrick has a similar directing approach, for many of his films story lines do tend to rapidly change half way through the film in the same way. Another directing trademark that Robert Rodriguez and Stanley Kubrick have in common, that I'm quite entertained by is the micro-second subliminal film shots that was filmed in this movie, in which the same micro-second subliminal filming was also done in Stanley Kubricks film 'A Clockwork Orange' This happened when Seth Gecko(George Clooney) walked into the motel room and viewed the woman hostage lying dead on his bed, in which his brother Richard gecko (Quentin Tarantino) had just raped and killed.The actors Juliette Lewis(Kate Fuller), George Clooney(Seth Gecko), Quentin Tarantino(Richard Gecko and Harvey Keitel(Jacob Fuller) are ideal actors for this film. What intrigues me about Harvey Keitel, George Clooney and Juliette Lewis is not the fact that their good actors, but is how confident their acting is, for in my opinion these actors (and a few other actors) are three of the most confident actors in Hollywood. What I like about Quentin Tarantino is that although he's not a great actor, the role that he does play in this film (and others) he does well at, for his eccentric acting, humour and wacky outlook makes me love watching him in films. Anyway if you haven't seen this film, I suggest you to watch it, for if you like George Clooney and Harvey Keitel you'll definitely like this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

"One Part Tarantino, One Part Rodriguez, All Parts Crazy","When you look at body of work of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, nothing could incorporate those styles more poetically and literally than ""From Dustk Till Dawn."" It could well be argued that their styles are mashed together like peanut butter and jelly rather than blended, the result is something fun and memorable nonetheless.The first half of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" serves up a crime drama with Tarantino's signature chaotic edge along and spurts of intense violence. Without any context, it's another wonderfully tension-ratcheted Tarantino film. Then our main characters go to check out the Titty Twister bar and strip club and suddenly we're handed gory over-the-top grindhouse mayhem.The only through-lines in the film are the characters. Performances from George Clooney and Harvey Keitel in particular make for a terrific overall film experience. Movies this screwy don't usually have the pleasure of such commanding talents, but ""Dusk"" has them and flaunts them. What we'd do 15 years later for Clooney to play a character like Seth Gekko again ...Gekko and his brother Richie are two thieves on the run. After blowing up a roadside convenience store, they run into father (Keitel) and his two kids at a Texas motel and decide to force them at gunpoint to take them over the border. Seth is smart and cocky whereas his brother clearly has some kind of mental disability in addition to being a sexual deviant. Throw all that out the window, however, when the entire lot of them are attacked by vampires.Keitel's Jacob Fuller is a God-fearing man who puts family first and the Gekkos and later vampires test that in different ways. Characters this likable never find their way into films like ""Dusk,"" but Tarantino characters have their own category. We empathize completely with Jacob's desire to keep his kids safe above all else.The creativity of the obscene B-movie side of ""Dusk"" (should I call it ""Dawn""?) makes Act II something worthy of enjoying all on its own. The makeup and visual effects work together in such a way that they form caricatures of vampires. We tend to laugh at the corniness of monster makeup, but the crew here has a self-awareness. They make ""Dusk"" freaky and hilarious all at the same time, never allowing the audience to dismiss it as total shlock.It's clear that as much as Tarantino and Rodriguez love these kinds of movies, they're not merely imitating the genre. They're giving it the quality of ingredients that only excellent filmmakers can provide. The only things holding it back are the grindhouse genre's inherent weaknesses and general confusion over why the first part of the film ultimately has nothing to do with the second. Those who like both filmmakers' styles will find ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" quite satisfying in all its imperfection.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"A ""dumb and dumber"" Clooney & Tarantino meet the vampires...about as gross as any movie can get...","This film was a complete turnoff for me. I only watched it for George Clooney and wondered how he could sink so low as to want to use this as his big screen opportunity.It's a strange combination of slasher/vampire film that has no focus and splits up into too many directions to form a coherent story. The characters have as much depth as cartoon creations and all of them are as freakish and pathetic as anyone can get. George Clooney mumbles his way through his role in a way that suggests he'd rather be back in ""ER"" with its own kind of gore than splashing the blood of vampires. Frankly, he ought to be better at choosing material than this mess.The story starts out as a gutsy crime drama but soon veers into downright nightmarish activity at a Mexican border bar staffed by vampires. Nudity, foul language, vulgar expletives--everything is poured on thick to appeal to today's younger movie-goers who have an appetite for sex, sadism and buckets of blood. About as gross as any movie can get without leaving you with a queasy stomach.Of course, you'll get the opposite opinion from those who think Quentin Tarantino is the master of pulp horror. This graphic depiction of vampirism is sure to have them raving that this is a masterpiece only a genius like Tarantino could have invented.Clooney still has to prove himself on the big screen.

Crazy flick!,"This film is totally ""crazy!"" (Well-meaning)
The action before the mysterious incidents was wonderfully staged and remained great in terms of story. However, you can tell from the special effects in the club that the film has a certain maturity. This fits the style of the film somewhat, but when you look at it more closely and compare it to other films of the time period, it is rather poorly executed. It somehow fits in, but it could look much more spectacular. This was related to the design surrounding the vampires, the violence is once again well implemented and the action scenes are excellent despite the crazy special effects.The story is exciting, no wonder since Tarantino worked on the script. The dialogues are once again outstanding and can convey emotions well and the scenes are often fantastic, I particularly liked the opening scene. The characters are really exciting, Tarantino, who also stars, takes on the role of a very funny guy and plays him surprisingly well, Clooney plays his role just as well and Keitel and the ""rest"" are also more than satisfactory. Tarantino, who, as already mentioned, took part in the script, cast himself in his aforementioned role and has close physical contact with Salma Hayek in one scene. An accident?The ending of the film is, in my opinion, far too simple.I would have hoped for something much more demanding, but I justify it by saying that From Dusk Till Dawn is also a film that can't really be described as demanding.The film is funny, exciting and, above all, entertaining, tells a cool story that is a bit too simple in the end, but overall impressed me. The presentation often seems a bit lacking due to the special effects of the creatures, but it also has its own flair. The film is absolutely solid and I will definitely watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

A Night of Blood and Mayhem,"From Dusk Till Dawn, directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino, is an action-horror film that effortlessly blends genres, starting as a crime thriller before making a sharp and bloody turn into vampire horror. The film follows two fugitive brothers, Seth and Richie Gecko (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino), who are on the run after a violent bank robbery. They take a family-Father Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and his two children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu)-hostage and head toward a remote strip club on the Mexican border, which turns out to be home to a terrifying group of vampires. What begins as a tense, character-driven crime drama swiftly morphs into a wild, gory, action-packed horror film.The cast is one of the film's strongest assets. George Clooney gives a charismatic and cool performance as Seth Gecko, a character who, despite his criminal background, is relatable and morally complex. His performance helps anchor the film's tonal shifts, adding depth to the story. Tarantino, as Richie Gecko, plays the more unhinged and psychotic brother, and while his performance is far more erratic, it's fitting for his character's dark and disturbing nature. Harvey Keitel as Father Jacob, a man trying to redeem himself, gives a surprisingly strong and grounded performance, especially given the increasingly absurd turns the film takes. The supporting cast, including Juliette Lewis and Tom Savini, also add to the film's quirky, yet entertaining, ensemble.Rodriguez's direction is dynamic, capturing both the suspense of the early crime thriller moments and the over-the-top chaos of the vampire-infested strip club later in the film. The film's pacing is uneven, with the first half focused on setting up the hostage situation and the brothers' personalities, while the second half escalates into a blood-soaked, action-filled battle for survival. The sudden shift from crime drama to vampire horror may be jarring for some viewers, but it's part of what makes the film so memorable and fun. Rodriguez's signature visual style, including quick cuts, dramatic lighting, and a high level of stylisation, enhances the film's energy, particularly during the vampire carnage.The film's special effects, particularly the vampire makeup and practical effects, are effective, if not groundbreaking. The film embraces its absurdity with the creatures becoming grotesque, over-the-top monsters, and the gore is handled with tongue-in-cheek humour. While the film's tone leans heavily into camp, it's done purposefully, with Rodriguez and Tarantino fully aware of the absurdity and leaning into it. The vampire action scenes are chaotic, gory, and fun, but they may not have the same level of sustained terror or atmosphere as more traditional horror films. Instead, the emphasis is on action and wild entertainment.However, From Dusk Till Dawn has its flaws. The tonal shift can feel jarring, and some viewers may struggle to connect with the abrupt transition from crime thriller to horror. The character development, while strong for the two leads, is fairly thin for the supporting characters, and the film doesn't always fully explore the relationships or backstories. The action-packed second half, while thrilling, sometimes lacks the depth or emotional weight that might have made the horror more impactful.In conclusion, From Dusk Till Dawn is a wildly entertaining film that successfully blends crime thriller and vampire horror, with strong performances, a unique premise, and plenty of action. While it may not have the depth or consistency of more traditional films in either genre, its energetic direction and fun tone make it an enjoyable ride for fans of both horror and action. It's a cult classic that stands out for its boldness, memorable characters, and relentless energy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Every hack in Hollywood contributed to this disaster,"*some spoilers follow*Looking back over my reviews, I see that I have a somewhat inconsistent reaction to violence. Maybe not inconsistent, but complicated. In general, I'm bothered by ""funny"" or glorified violence, and ""From Dusk 'Till Dawn"" wallows in both. From the moment that the ""heroes"" set fire to a convenience store clerk, they lose all of my sympathy. They're every bit as repulsive as the vampires - so who cares if they win or lose? An essential element of horror is that the victims should be likable, so we can be alarmed at the prospect of their deaths; here, they're a bunch of jerks.The film could still be good, if viewed on an entirely superficial level, but it's not. Rodriguez's over-the-top action just looks tacky. The CGI effects are already ludicrous, the vampire makeups are silly (rubberized demons - what is this, a BBC production?), and the violence is neither exciting nor scary - it's merely gross.Check the trivia section and note that Quentin Tarantino - that fiercely original screenwriter and director - ripped off all of the film's best lines from older movies. I guess it was too much effort to come up with an original script, right? Of course, the siege aspect of the story comes right out of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and about 10,000 other horror films. At least Sex Machine acknowledges one debt - the improvised cross is lifted from Peter Cushing's ""Horror of Dracula,"" a film that's superior to this pile of crap in virtually every respect.This is horror for the stupid set, a movie where the coolest thing in evidence is a ""crotch cannon."" It's SO mindless that I can't even appreciate it on the same level as bad Godzilla; it's TRYING to be campy and stupid, but at the same time masquerading as a piece of decent film art created by famous people, and it's that clash of styles that bothers me so. This film is dishonest. It's a turd wrapped in silk. It thumbs its nose at horror while trying to horrify. In short, it's maybe the worst film I've ever seen...and I've had to sit through it twice! Do I get some kind of endurance award for that?",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Not exactly a good movie, but nevertheless enjoyable","This is the type of movie that can easily be liked and just as easily disliked. It's obviously not in the same class as most other Tarantino movies, but whether you enjoyed it or not really depends on the mood you're in at the time. When I first saw it, I thought it was hilarious, and the enjoyment was enhanced by the fact that it didn't take itself seriously. Clooney is incredibly witty and charismatic, and Tarantino is at his irritating best as an actor (which isn't much). I'll probably watch this again some other time and think it's a piece of crap, but for now, I'll say it's worth getting out on video if you feel like watching a lot of gore and cool action, horror and comedy.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
George Clooney becomes a movie star,"George Clooney's performance in this film is as cool as it gets. He is superb as the less psycho half of a brother partnership. Tarantino is OK but should stick to behind the camera. Nevermind, the film has some excellent script moments, some excellent cinematography moments and some superb action sequences. However, the movie just falls short of being excellent due to limp performances by the other cast members as well as lumbering towards a mad and terrific ending. George Clooney's last statement to Juliette Lewis is one of the coolest one liners ever and helps define him as a future movie hero. This film is a neurotic ride of violent craziest and will be enjoyed by most.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"""You're telling me I'm not good enough to drink here?!""","Looking for something that doesn't abide by regular horror genera rules? ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" may be the one to choose. With a sizzling screenplay by Quentin Tarantino and perfectly directed by Robert Rodriguez, this is a horror/thriller to remember. The Gecko brothers are two extremely violent criminals who end up taking a family hostage. The family is forced to drive the notorious brothers to the end of the border. They end up making a pit stop at a Mexican bar, where the brothers are supposed to meet their contact. However, things get out of hand when it turns out that the place is contaminated with vampire strippers and truckers. You add all of those elements together and you get one hell of a ride that you'll never forget. I'm not the biggest fan of vampires, but I thought this was an excellent movie.Probably the best element in the film is George Clooney, as he not only has many of the best lines, but also delivers them in a convincing manner. Harvey Keitel is certain worth watching, yet he seemed to take his part just a bit too seriously at times, in my opinion, but this was offset by Clooney and his underlying jovialness. Lewis, whom I don't care for in general, did alright, and actually looked kinda cute, albeit a trifle skinny for my tastes. Tarantino was probably the weakest element in the film, but at least he and director Rodriguez had the good sense to populate the film with enough talent to offset this factor. If you're not a fan of the graphic violence, then you should avoid this one, as its loaded with visceral goriness.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

"A very slick, stylish, funny film.","Dusk Till Dawn is a cinematic masterpiece. It combines horror and black comedy with supreme experience. Rodriguez's direction is perfect and all the performances are terrific. All the roles are perfectly casted and add to the incredible atmosphere of the film. The film is clever because its two different types of films combined. A chase\cops & robbers film and a horror film.

I am ashamed of myself for enjoying this movie,"I must be getting corrupted in my old age.  Everything about this movie offended me - the language, the rotten characters (the characters, not the actors), the excessive violence and nauseating gore. It was also trashy with no redeeming social virtues.  I don't know why, but I really enjoyed it.  It was funny and scary (very scary) and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I was watching it. I think it must be somewhere in the Robert Rodriguez touch.  I have trouble with Tarantino (I really didn't like Pulp Fiction, even it is one of the beat movies ever made.)

Put it in the proper context...,"Not a film to be taken too seriously, but a hell of a lot of fun to watch. This was Tarantino's first screenplay (first one he wrote, not first one put to film) and there's a reason for it's existence; Tarantino believed that he would get, at most, one shot at being a success in films (being a nobody working at a video rental store in LA at the time) and as such he needed to get ""everything"" in there. So he throws his whole wad into it; tense psychological suspense, extreme violence, vampires, hot chicks, great dialogue, and lots and lots of humor. As has been mentioned previously, it seems like two films in one. The first ""film"" is about the psychotic Gecko brothers, and their bloody attempt to get across the Mexican border and away from the law. The second ""film"" is an over-the-top vampire flick with all the cliches. Tarantino and Rodriguez are long time friends, and Quentin agreed to let him film the screenplay so long as he could play the really twisted Gecko brother. Taken as a whole, this film is the cinematic equivalent of a full-course meal... creepy, NBK-type violence at the beginning, over-the-top comedy at the end, with George Clooney, Harvey Keitel & Juliette Lewis providing surprisingly top-notch performances. Salma Hayek is nothing short of spectacular because she does what she does best, which is eye candy with precious little acting. Anyone who's enjoyed anything written or directed by Tarantino should find plenty to enjoy in this film... however, this is not a film that stands up to critical analysis. It was not intended to win an Oscar, it was merely supposed to give Quentin further work in the film business... and it succeeded admirably.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
An Embarrassment,"A promising beginning quickly gives way to shameful exploitation and excesses that are unworthy of the participants involved, and even the most adept rationalization will not excuse them from taking part in a project that is so blatantly devoid of anything even remotely close to possessing any redeeming aspects or qualities whatsoever.  Screenwriter Quentin Tarantino and director Robert Rodriguez had apparently attained the kind of stature within the right kind of circles that gave them free reign going into the production of `From Dusk Till Dawn,' and the results are something akin to what happens when you turn a couple of undisciplined youngsters loose in a toy store and then refuse to hold them accountable for the mess they make.  The thing is, the people involved here are artists, who collectively and individually, have proven themselves capable of achievements beyond the norm; and as an audience-- collectively and individually-- that is what we have come to expect from them.  And that's not saying that every time out Tarantino has to give us a `Pulp Fiction,' or that Clooney or Keitel are expected to turn in an Academy Award worthy performance.  But given their credentials, it is not out of line to expect them to deliver a product that includes at least some semblance of dignity, integrity and quality.  And, unfortunately, none of the above are to be found anywhere in this `B-' schlock Rodriguez and Co. have fostered upon an unsuspecting public.The degradations begin when the morally bankrupt Gecko brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Tarantino), go on a spree of murder and robbery on their way to Mexico, where they're to meet up with a colleague who will provide them with a safe haven-- for a price, of course.  Near the border, to facilitate their crossing, they kidnap a minister, Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel), and his children, Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu). Seth sees the motor home Jacob is driving as the perfect vehicle to get them to their destination, and the recently widowed Jacob-- who is currently struggling with his faith-- sees no choice but to go along with the demands of his captors.  What Jacob cannot know, however, is that he will be taking them to a rendezvous that will deposit them all veritably at the gates of Hell.In the opening scene, a Texas Ranger, Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), walks into a somewhat secluded liquor store where he has a conversation with the young clerk, during which they discuss the news of the Gecko brothers.  Of course, Seth and Richie are already at hand, and the ensuing violence sets the stage for all that follows.  And right up to the part at which the first shots are fired, courtesy of a riveting, if all too brief, performance by Parks (this is actually the film's best scene), it's actually a good beginning to a very bad movie.  At this point, the film has had it's moment, and it's all downhill from there.With this screenplay, Tarantino-- who made a name for himself (and rightly so) with `Pulp Fiction' and `Reservoir Dogs,'-- developed a blueprint for excessive (even for him) violence and moral abasement, then handed it over to Rodriguez, who took the ball and ran with it.  Straight down into the ground.  The characters and situations created in this film give a negative value to human life and propriety, even taken within the broadest cinematic terms of expression.  And the use of advanced technology and F/X by Rodriguez toward such an end as this is contemptible.  Totally without redeeming value, this film appeals to nothing more than the basest instincts of the infantile mind, and is an embarrassment to the craft of filmmaking.If you bother to sift through the detritus of this visual and psychological malady, you will actually find a decent performance by Clooney, though given the context in which it exists, it will take an extremely objective eye to discern it at all.  Seeking out a good performance here is like attempting to remedy the stench of a pig sty with a can of air freshener.  And it's tough watching someone you admire as an artist wallow (and willingly yet) in such claptrap as this.As far as the participation of Harvey Keitel in this, one can only wonder what could have prompted such a decision.  In fact, one can speculate that Jacob Fuller's loss of faith occurred after he read this script.The supporting cast includes Salma Hayek (Santanico Pandemonium), Cheech Marin (in three roles), Danny Trejo (Razor Charlie), Fred Williamson (Frost) and Kelly Preston (Newscaster Kelly Houge).  A disaster that should never have been allowed to see the light of day, `From Dusk Till Dawn' will no doubt find it's own niche in the `cult film' Hall of Fame, and unfortunately there are those who will embrace this nonsense out-of-hand.  If made by amateurs or an aspiring filmmaker who simply did not know better, the existence of this film would at least be understandable and acceptable within the context of those given terms and conditions.  But with the names and talents of the likes of Tarantino, Clooney, Rodriguez, Keitel and Lewis attached, there is no excuse for it; no excuse whatsoever.  In the final analysis, this is nothing more than a demonstration of the blatant misuse of the magic that is the movies.  I rate this one 1/10.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Great Pre-Grindhouse,"From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)**** (out of 4)Robert Rodriquez takes a Quentin Tarantino script and turns out a wild ride of a film that pays homage to the grindhouse cinema. Two fugitives (George Clooney, Tarantino) are trying to get across the Mexican border and takes a family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu) hostage. Once across the border they stop at a bar, which just happens to be full of vampires. Even in the horror community the opinions are split on this one but I love every second of it. I loved how the film starts out as a crime drama and then does a complete turn into a horror film. Both halves of the film work fine with me due in large part to Tarantino's script but the cast is simply wonderful. Keitel is great as usual and Clooney made a wonderful debut here. The supporting cast of Lewis, Tarantino, Tom Savini, John Saxson, Fred Williamson, Salma Hayek and Cheech Marin are incredibly fun to watch and bring the film up several notches. There's some great gore, strong laughs and a great dance by Hayek, which shows Tarantino's foot fetish once again.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Splatter fest, but entertaining","Although the gratuitous violence and gore detract a little from it, I really enjoyed this gem from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. Admittedly the plot is a little far fetched, but it makes enough fun of itself that you can laugh at it easily. The main thing I noticed about this film was the acting. It would have been easy to lose sight of acting amidst the sex, violence and gore, but for me it shone through the guts as glory. George Clooney delivers one of the best performances if not the best that he has shown on the silver screen, and he was well backed up by Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Cheech Marin (3 in 1 guy). Good performances by Danny Trejo, the delectable Salma Hayek, and the biker guy made this a really fun ride. Clooney's delivery of his many one liners was superb, truly excellent. The fight scenes were also well done, although as mentioned already the splatter was a little over the top in places. However the acting, great sets and costumes, and a willingness not to take itself too seriously make this a fine film, and definitely one to see (for those over 18). 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Gore and Violence..........,"If given two words to describe From Dusk Till Dawn, I would say its Violent and Gorey ( the and doesn't count. ) Now From Dusk Till Dawn is a different kind of movie. This film took two directors/writers that make totally different movies to collide in a big bash of craziness. And while normally that ends up sucking, this film was great. I was a big fan of the first half, I feel like it is too serious and way to disturbing. But as soon as they get into the bar, (while the film is still disturbing at times) it has a lot more fun with itself. The writing is great and all the practical effects and kills are all good too. Overall, while far from a stereotypical depiction of a good movie. I believe that From Dusk Till Dawn is absolutely absurd and fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Halfway through, you're seemingly ripped from one film and thrown straight into another.","'From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)' takes such a sudden, unapologetic and incredibly jarring turn in the middle of its second act - in terms of style, tone and even genre - that you feel as though you've been ripped from your seat and tossed into another film, thrown from a straight-forward but slightly seedy and interestingly mean crime-thriller into a brazenly silly and quite camp vampire gore-fest. As such, it's difficult to take seriously as an example of either movie (though I don't think 'serious' was ever one of its concerns). The worst thing is that, for how much I appreciate unique and (marketing and fame aside) surprising stories that aren't afraid to break conventions and be generally 'weird', its first half is honestly much better than its second, talking time to build proper characters and having them interact in unexpected ways that make sense within its established yet still somewhat heightened world. I'm not saying the vampire slaying isn't entertaining; the tangible effects and hammy genre winks do make for some enjoyable sequences. It's just that the ending almost feels like it's tacked on from another piece (without any real foreshadowing, even) and it reduces the movie's overall impact almost to the point that the finale feels like it might be better off watched in isolation. Basically, the thing is two good movies carelessly smashed together. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

You can definitely see both of thier styles in both parts of the movie, and I do think both thier styles go well together, I just think the moving from one style to the other could be a little better. It was a time bit jarring. But Quentin Tarantino really shows his acting chops here. And Salma Hayek's scene is probably the sexiest scene I'm Film history.

A movie that will amaze you,"When I sat down to watch the movie ""From Dusk to Dawn"", I did not read the synopsis of the film. I just knew that some actors I know play there. And the title didn't reveal the essence of the film to me. In my opinion, it was the right decision, because the events taking place in the film turn out to be very unexpected.The film begins as a kind of adventure picture. There is a situation. The two brothers need to get away from the cops. They intend to hide in Mexico and it turns out that the heroes take a family hostage. The first scenes show the ""hand"" of the master Robert Rodriguez, who has his own signature style - blood, maximum violence, shooting and fighting. Such a plot twist immediately chained to the screen, not giving a chance to break away. Then the audience begins to introduce the characters.Clooney plays one of the brothers named Seth. He is seen as a cunning, intelligent, calculating person who sees a lot of options in advance. He is handsome, charming, and even inspires some confidence. I think George was a great fit for this role.Tarantino plays the role of Richard's second brother. This is the complete opposite of Seth. He is presented as somewhat disgusting, immoral and, it seems, even insane in some moments. Quentin is simply gorgeous in this role. He disgusted me the whole movie. You never know what to expect from him. The only hope is for his brother, who will be able to stop Richard in time.The actors playing the captured family are also not bad, but they are slightly inferior in color to the ""brothers"" Clooney and Tarantino.Finishing the conversation about the actors, it is impossible not to mention the legendary role of Salma Hayek, who appeared in the image of a fatal dancer with a snake. This scene is very memorable, as is the song, under which the actress demonstrates a magnificent figure and plasticity. Of course, Salma is a wonderful dramatic actress, she has shown herself in many films, but here she demonstrates precisely the female beauty of the body, the grace of lines. Her dance is beautiful.The script and direction are excellent. The narration is conducted in such a way that it is impossible to distract, and the adventurous spirit does not leave for a minute. And I want to see what happens next. There are several good moments that make you keep your fingers crossed for the heroes.Towards the end of the film, after a bloody denouement, you realize that this is not an ordinary typical representative of a particular genre. Cinema, thanks to a chic script and acting, combines, and sometimes immediately changes the genre. This is both a bloody thriller and an adventure and a fantasy. And very successful. And it is noteworthy that the viewer expects some kind of confrontation between hostages and kidnappers in the finale, but gets an absolutely unexpected collision that simply shocks. In my opinion, this is a great twist.As a result, we got a kind of very emotional, bloody, wild film, which has its own novelty, extraordinary plot development, amazing characters and a wonderful atmosphere. ""From dusk to dawn"" is perfect for viewing today, promising to give viewers a lot of emotions and impressions.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Starts Strong, Ends Weak","A campy movie that I enjoyed more before the vampires showed up. The dynamic between the Gecko brothers was a real highlight with Tarantino's character being a fascinatingly demented psychopath. Once the vampires show up it turns into an all-out B-movie style action flick which is fine, but it is kind of silly and the vulgarity is a little over the top in the strip joint. The ending also underwhelmed with a noticeable lack of resolution. Ultimately I'd give the first half of the movie a 7 and the last half a 6.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

90 minutes of pure fun,"As others have said, this is a movie of two halves. Quentin's and Robert's. There's no doubt about which they are. From the very beginning of them both. The shift between is immediately recognizable as well. I doubt even a little effort was made on anyone's part to cover any of this up. Why should they? They aren't kidding anyone, nor attempting to do so. This is clearly, from start to finish, meant to be enjoyable, and guess what? It is. Whether that makes it their weakest piece is up for debate... I personally don't believe so. It's no secret that Rodriguez does his best work when the writing is done for him... just take Sin City... and he actually emulates Tarantino's directorial style well, keeping his own, highly energetic and cartoon-inspired, under wraps save for his portion. Aforementioned, however, is a more skillful script author(and herein, actually a pretty decent actor). So with them each filling the respective role they fit better, we're set for solid entertainment. And they certainly deliver. So do the effects crew. The music never leaves anything to be desired. The action is awesome. There is quite a bit of blood, gore and violence in this. Straight, single males also have plenty to look at. Clooney is bad-ass, with credit to QT for putting the words in his mouth, literally. The acting varies, but it's never downright poor. Savini isn't bad. The humor is twisted. The tone is cheesy. The pacing is about spot-on. The plot remains interesting throughout. Characters are relatively developed, certainly sufficiently. If you'll allow me to briefly digress... those viewing this and subsequently wanting a similar gaming experience, I would advise against going for the licensed release, of 2001... I did only play the demo, but I was rather underwhelmed. I instead suggest Vampire Slayer, the free and legally so modification for Half-Life, as it is very obviously inspired by this. Turning my attention back to the film... go for this, those who are into Quentin Tarantino's dialog and story-lines, and/or Robert Rodriguez' action and visuals. There's a DVD of this available with featurettes, music videos, the full-length documentary Full Tilt Boogie and alternate footage. There is also an informative commentary with the two who came together to make this, and it's definitely worth a listen if you like this. I recommend this flick to any fans of the people who helped create it, the ones who belong in one or more of the aforementioned groups in particular. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
A blast from my childhood,"There are certain movies that just stick with you. For me, one of the many movies that I remember watching in my childhood is From Dusk Till Dawn. I remember watching this for the first time on VHS, about 10 years after the film was released. From Dusk Till Dawn was released in 1996 and is produced, edited, and directed by Robert Rodriguez (Desperado and Planet Terror) and stars Harvey Keitel (Pulp Fiction and U-571), George Clooney (The Perfect Storm and Three Kings), Quentin Tarantino (who also wrote and produced this film, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs), and Juliette Lewis (Natural Born Killers and August: Osage County). The film was a box office hit and received mixed but has had a huge cult following since release and since the release, the film has spawned two sequels and a TV series.Two criminal brothers known as the Gecko Brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino), kidnap a family and travel to Mexico to escape from the authorities. But they make a stop at a bar, whose attendants are not as all they seem.I forgot how fun this film is. From Dusk Till Dawn is two different films put into one. The first half plays out like a crime thriller and a very very good one too. It has all of the great and clever Tarantino written dialogue that you would want. Also has some good shoot outs that showcase some brutal violence. I am really interested in these characters. While both of the Gecko brothers are not good people, I some how really like Clooney's character. He plays the straight character opposite to Tarantino's creepy and unhinged character. While never being a huge fan of Tarantino's acting, he does a decent enough job here. Clooney excels and is pretty much what I remember most from this film is Clooney's character. After about halfway through the film, the film changes from an action thriller, to a fun and entertaining, balls to the wall craziness vampire movie. It is certainly a film that you could show someone and mess with them about it, taking in to consideration that they have not seen it yet. As a kid, I remember liking the second half better because I was more creeped out. But, as I grow wiser and more knowledgeable in film, I realize that I like the first half is my favorite. Literally, a film could be made of just the first half alone. The second half of the film comes a bit out of nowhere but I am still thoroughly entertained by it. We get some memorable side characters and we see some fantastic special effects from KNB on showcase here. Harvey Keitel, while being hardly noticeable as a priest and father who has lost faith, does another solid job here and I love that his character is given a nice and decent arc here. Even when the film switched from crime thriller to vampire movie, Tarantino's writing is still pretty great. One thing that has stuck with me through all these years is the soundtrack to this film. The song Dark Night by The Blasters is a song I strongly remember and hearing it again was a complete joy to me. So aside from the fact that, while entertaining as all hell, the vampire plot comes a bit out of nowhere, my only other negative is that I am at times a bit unsettled by the vulgarity of this film. Especially one scene where the p-word is said numerous, and I mean numerous, times in a row to a point that I was a bit taken out of the film because I had to basically say ""ok I get it"" and then return to the film. Other than that, I can't much complain.From Dusk Till Dawn is a fast paced part crime thriller, part vampire film that is loads of fun. Some might be turned away by the fact that this is essentially two films combined into one but I advise that one must keep an open mind about this film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

The minister's family tried to give some balance, but he was reduced to blithering rather than emboldened by what he experienced. Then the bar bums and naked women turned into vampires.

Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, hot off the successes of 'Desperado' and 'Pulp Fiction' respectively, found themselves of being in the enviable position of being able to take Tarantino's early script intended for a low budget b-grade horror/exploitation movie, and being able to make it with a lot more money than originally envisioned, and with their dream cast of characters actors and cult favourites. They obviously relished this once in a lifetime opportunity, and really took all the way, ending up with one of the most enjoyable and entertaining movies in years. George Clooney, a household name via 'E.R', but let's face it, a  veteran of many awful and forgettable TV shows and movies, is a revelation here in a star making lead role as Seth Gecko. Tarantino himself gives his most convincing acting performance to date as his psychotic brother Richard. Harvey Keitel gives first class support as a vacationing ex-priest who unfortunately crosses their path. Juliette Lewis plays Keitel's daughter in a slightly underwritten role that only has a few standout scenes. The rest of the cast is outstanding and includes everyone from Cheech Marin ('Up In Smoke') to Tom Savini ('Dawn Of The Dead'), Michael Parks ('Then Came Bronson'), to Fred Williamson ('Black Caesar'), John Saxon ('Enter The Dragon') to Danny Trejo ('Heat'), as well as mega-babe and Rodriguez regular Salma Hayek in an unforgettable sequence as Santanico Pandemonium. This is the ultimate beer and pizza movie and on that level is difficult to fault. A highly recommended fun filled modern trash classic!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"A Guilty Pleasure - Tarantino, Clooney, Keitel, Hayek elevate the mindless B-movie Splatter","From Dusk Till Dawn is a half crime drama half vampire gorefest. Given my own bias against vampire films (the only good ones being Bram Stoker's Dracula and John Carpenter's Vampires), I much prefer the crime-laden first half of the film. The first half is stylish, suspenseful, entertaining, smooth as ice, and contains an electrifying opening scene. The initial appeal is the dynamic duo of George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino acting opposite one another. But the real appeal is hearing the always smooth George Clooney recite snappy Tarantino dialogue. Music to our ears. It makes you wonder why these two haven't teamed up since.The second half of the film does a complete 180. While it delivers a seductive dance sequence from a young Salma Hayek, and some funny cameos from Cheech Marin, it deviates into a high-octane vampire bloodbath. The vampire makeup effects look cheesy and some vampires inexplicably explode for no reason. By the end you wonder what was the point of the film, and realize it had nothing below the surface. Yet this is how B-movies are supposed to be. The vampire carnage can feel stupid and not scary, but the second half is never boring and there's always something happening. Most notably being Harvey Keitel's character regaining his faith, and exclaiming how he is ""a mean mother effing servant of God.""From Dusk Till Dawn is a guilty pleasure mashing up black comedy, crime thrills, action spills, horror chills, and some eye candy courtesy of Salma Hayek. The talent in front of and behind the camera elevates the trashy material to enjoyable heights.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

A fun movie from Robert Rodriguez,"A fun movie from Robert Rodriguez and a great cast of George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino (who wrote the story), Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Selma Hayek, and Cheech Marin (who played three roles). This is a rather violent, action movie that could have easily been a turn off, but Robert Rodriguez took Quentin's story and they made an entertaining movie. Quentin's characters always seem to have so much life to them and I think that's what makes the movie better. It could have easily just been a cheesy, totally unbelievable action/horror piece. Not that we're going to walk away thinking what happened could really happen, but as I was watching the movie I wasn't considering the plausibility and was just enjoying the ride. Nice little bits of comedy thrown in which I think made it that much easier to take the violent parts.

"Starts brilliantly, but takes an odd turning","An odd one, this. It starts out as one thing, establishes the opening mood very well, and then half-way through, just as we're really starting to get into it, it completely changes in tone, atmosphere and even genre into something slightly less impressive. I'm left wondering if it was Rodriguez's intention all along to create a flick that, very movie monster-like, is one thing by day and something very different altogether by night. Against a daylight setting, it's a crime thriller/character study wrapped up in a road movie, complete with sparkling dialogue, neat direction and interesting characters Â and, as with any film revolving round a road trip, the real fun is always in the getting there. Maybe that's the problem Â our heroes get to where they're going before we've even reached the midway point. It's here, in the nocturnal-based scenes, that the film undergoes its massive transformation, morphing into a rather raucous and grotesque kind of popcorn horror (though admittedly a tad too gruesome to inspire much of an appetite for popcorn consumption) with blood-sucking vampires, exploding heads and bodily fluid leakage aplenty. In merging the two distinctive halves together, I'm not sure just how successful it really is. It's certainly very different, captures the viewer off-guard as it goes, and the latter half still manages to provide decent, if mindless, entertainment, but it ultimately can't help but prove a mild disappointment in not quite living up to the slickness promised in the initial scenes.The earlier scenes are the ones I personally prefer watching. It's here that the characters, when we're first introduced to them, are at their utmost best Â the composed and easygoing criminal fugitive Seth Gecko, his immature, anti-social younger brother Ritchie, and, from the other side of the tracks, Jacob, a preacher-turned-agnostic widower with two teenage kids, all of whom are forced to accompany Seth and Ritchie on their run from the law when their paths inadvertently cross. The interaction that ensues between all five of these characters is excellent, the acting is fine (Clooney and Kietel both pull off their roles with ease, and, contrary to some critical bandwagons, Tarantino isn't bad at all) while there's a certain sprinkling of depth to them each that you desperately want the movie to work with. It's tempting sometimes, on repeated viewings, just to tune out once the vampire scenes get underway, not so much due to the goriness involved, but because what becomes of these characters from then on is a little unsatisfying. There are a few rewarding moments in between as both the kidnappers and their hostages begin to show signs of bonding and mutual understanding, but the beastly confrontations that soon entail never truly enable them to develop to their full potential Â well, face it, what we have here is a brilliant ensemble of protagonists who could have faired easily as well in a more sophisticated adventure than the one they wound up with.The humor in the sunlight half is also better accomplished, and fits in perfectly with the tension Â healthy servings of macabre quirkiness as Ritchie examines his hand wound during the opening credits sequence (ouchÂnasty), and the inspired bickering between the two fugitive siblings as they exit the scene of one of their crimes, none of which detract from the screenplay's tenser moments. The nocturnal half, meanwhile, is obviously too silly to pass itself off as serious horror, and a mite too ugly to be all that amusing (still get a few giggles here and there, but what it mostly triggers, amidst all the guitar-strumming on dismantled human body parts, is unease). Even Tarantino's excellent scripting skills get a little bogged down in the subject matter around here, to the point where his zesty style seems completely absent. It would be wrong, however, to imply that the sequences involving those nefarious blood-suckers are lacking in a distinguishing edge of their own Â Rodriguez does a good job with the atmospherics here in particular, highlighting the claustrophobic, infernal feel of the vampires' lair and giving it an appropriately nightmarish quality. That's probably the thing that works best about it.What 'From Dusk Till Dawn' ultimately amounts to is an energetic and very enjoyable kind of summer movie, memorable and unusual enough to be worthy of the cult following it grabbed soon after. If you can accept it for what it is, then its entertainment value is guaranteed, and, as a loyal Tarantino fan, I've found plenty of things to savour. Still, a part of me will always wonder about the intelligent character drama that might have been had the Gecko brothers chosen to travel down a slightly different junction.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino collaboration shows the vampire-horror genre at its best,"Director Robert Rodriguez and producer Quentin Tarantino make their third collaboration after the action film 'Desperado' and the anthology comedy 'Four Rooms' with this exhilarating action-horror extravaganza complete with a brilliant Tarantino script. In this film, George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play brothers Seth and Richie Gecko, two wanted felons by the FBI who have committed a string of bank robberies and homicide. In attempt to flee to Mexico, the brothers kidnap a family of three: Jacob Fuller (played by Harvey Keital), a devoted Catholic father who has recently lost his wife, and his two children Kate (played by Juliette Lewis) and Scott (played by Ernest Liu); who are traveling on vacation in an RV. The brothers order them to drive them to Mexico where they end up at an strip club known as ""The Titty Twister"" owned by Carlos (played by Cheech Marin), a Mexican border guard. Things quickly grow awry when the club is revealed to be inhabited by blood-thirsty vampires who ensue a vicious, gore-filled onslaught. The Gecko brothers and the Fuller family team up to defend themselves against the vampire mayhem until the crack of dawn.This action-horror flick present audience with both the amazing action-packed thrills of Robert Rodriguez's style of filmaking and the ingenious style of writing by Quentin Tarantino who also makes an appearance as a main character unlike the brief cameos he's notable for in his films, though his performance may not be on par with his directorial skills. This film basically brings just about everything fans could ask for in both a Rodriguez film and a Tarantino film: top-notch characters, darkly funny dialogue, and an exhilarating plot. Also featuring Salma Hayek who makes an appearance as a sexy bouncer, the film delivers some tense, over-the-top vampire action that while extremely heavy on blood and gore, is very exciting and fun to watch. The beautifully (and scarily) animated vampires will have audience gripping their seats and the intense atmosphere almost perfectly balances the heavy action and scares that will please both action and horror fans. The same can said about the visuals (though slightly cheesy) and production design of the strip club which serves as the main action set for the majority of the film. The performance by George Clooney who is a stranger to roles on the wrong side of the moral compass, sits well as does Harvey Keital who's been collaborator for works by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs).From Dusk Til Dawn sets a textbook example of how an action-horror film should be, and is also one of the best (if not the best) collaborations of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino who later go on to co-directer the B-movie double feature 'Grindhouse' ten years later. If you come across this movie, this would be a good choice for action and horror fans. Although the film isn't anything close to a masterpiece, what is important that is it is fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Surreal and entertaining.,"This is basically a movie about two robbers, their hostages and a host of drunken truckers and bikers fighting off vampiric strippers in Mexico. Sound good? OK, well, welcome to Robert Rodriguez' From Dusk Till Dawn, the only movie I've ever seen that has managed to so effectively make you afraid of mostly naked women. That has to be some kind of an accomplishment, and Quentin Tarantino is in this movie too - with a writing credit and a healthy post-Pulp Fiction sensibility to boot. That only adds to the surreality of the whole thing.So the movie pretty much jettisons along at rocket speed, with lots of silly moments and some really cool head explosions and gore later on when the slaying starts literally out of nowhere. Why are there vampires in Mexico? I don't know, all I know is that I'm not visiting any strip bars down there. This movie is worth watching though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
From Dusk Till Dawn (1996),"72/100. This stylish film starts out with a bang and never lets up. I wish they would have just left the vampire angle out, what was an excellent film prior to that, suddenly it went over the top big time. It spoiled the film a lot for me. What a terrific cast, the acting is great, particularly Quentin Tarantino. George Clooney, Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel also do a terrific job. Great sound effects and special effects. It does go a bit over the top with the gore. Incredible pacing, the main characters are well defined. It's certainly a film worth watching. It's not for all tastes, but I admire the effort, and it certainly rises above most of the films in this genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Classic horror shoot em up,"From Dusk Till Dawn is a gritty, bloody, psycho southern vampire western birthed of both the different artistic styles of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. It's a hybrid, charging out of the gate with the laconic dialogue and pulpy, cooked to perfection aura of Tarantino's crime outings, then plunges into the slimy, schlock bucket hell of a Rodriguez horror flick. It's that jarring upset in tone that makes it so memorable and hard to pin down in the genre books. George Clooney is an energetic viper as dangerous bandit Seth Gecko, and Quentin Tarantino, who can actually act when he puts his mind to it, is terrifying as his delusional, violent brother Richie, a monster prone to harsh acts of brutality. They are on the run from the Texas law after a violent bank robbery, and following a dusty prologue involving everyone's favourite Texas Ranger Earl McGraw (Michael Parks, his first trip out as the iconic lawman), they kidnap an ex preacher (Harvey Keitel) and his two kids (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) and hightail it to a remote area for some waiting time as Seth plans to meet with a shady associate. It's their rotten luck that the place they pick to lie low, a rowdy hellhole of a roadhouse called the 'Titty Twister', is the last place they should have looked. No sooner have they settled into its chaotic interior, the staff bar the doors and all change into leering Mexican vampires, out to feast on the truckers, bikers and our unfortunate heroes until the sun comes up. From there the film ramps up for one of the biggest, baddest, bloodiest orgy of body parts, gooey effects, stakes through the heart, gunshot wounds galore, and fleshy, latex infested nastiness I've ever seen a horror movie keep up for an hour on end. I'd love to see the budget for practical effects on this one, and work put in. It's an endless parade of freak show proportions, and you'll feel the slime dripping off you when the closing credits come up. You haven't lived until you've seen the human spinal cord played as a saxophone with a screaming head on the end of it. The vamps come in all shapes and sizes too, from Cheech Marin's Chet Pussy (one of the three characters he plays), to Danny Trejo's tough guy bartender Razor Charlie, to sultry Salma Hayek's sexy Santanico Pandemonium. She has a dance sequence with a snake that will have anyone salivating, before she goes full beast mode and terrorizes everyone, that is. Tom Savini is great as Sex Machine, who has a gun for a willy, and Fred Williamson kills it as a nam vet who's seen some stuff, man. Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel provide the movie with what little heart that can be taken seriously among the silliness, and are both excellent. Rodriguez, Nicotero and team seriously outdo themselves in the effects department, turning the climax of their film into a claustrophobic, hairy shoot em up taking place in hell. Clooney has never been more of a bad boy, a tribal tattooed (lol), volatile prick with a good side only drawn forth by the baddest circumstances. Check out the sequels too, especially the third. They're toned down, but still a lot fun. Just avoid the new TV show like the plague, it's crap and doesn't deserve the title. Vampire westerns come in all forms, from poetic (Near Dark), to clunky (John Carpenter's Vampires) to slick (Priest).

"Well, at least it started out well.","I saw this movie about two weeks ago with a friend and new very little to nothing about it when I began watching. I vaguely remembered something about vampires being in the movie, but as the film began, I thought my memory must've been wrong, because this was a movie about two bankrobbers/murderers named the Gecko brothers, Clooney (Excellent as an anti-hero character) and Tarantino (not as excellent).The first half hour is quite good, thanks to Tarantino's great script and solid acting by Clooney and his hostage Keitel, a preacher with two children who has lost his faith due to the death of his wife. After they cross the border into Mexico to avoid the police and FBI, they go to a not so family-friendly bar to meet their accomplice in the robberies.Then the entire movie falls apart.It turns out that all of the people that work in the bar are secretly vampires, and an ultra-gory biting and stabbing scene follows, complete with decapitating and removing beating hearts.Now don't get me wrong, there are some well choreographed vampire fight scenes in this movie that can be attributed to director Rodriguez, but the transition between the Gecko Brothers escaping to the vampire hunting is so choppy that it feels like two completely different movies just crammed together.After the movie was over, my friend and I both agreed it was one of the dumbest movies we had ever seen and were both severely disappointed.

Definitely a cult classic and a 7-10 for the cult fan...,"However Metacritic, needs to seriously review its system and needs to categorize films by ratings or target audience.I don't care what Selma Hayek says...but she either spends 90 minutes with a makeup artist before she is seen in public, or has sun glasses on. (back in the day Marlene Dietrich could pull this off in black and white films till she was 62...however find those pictures accurately colorized you can see tape and she looks like a clown). In terms of ""Breast enlargement"" 25% of menopausal women's breasts get larger however only in relation to the rest of the body and is mostly fat tissue. So when she says ""I can't explain they keep getting bigger and bigger"" and example can be seen in 95-05 Sigourney Weaver, compared to Alien and Aliens. So Selma Hayek can say day and night she hasn't had breast augmentation she either has a magic wonder bra...or a pump since always and her chest is like the tire on a bike. Seeing many pictures she has filled out more all over, she likely had a breast lift if not implants. And her face definitely slight Botox and makeup, I don't see any lip injection or indication of surgery. I know there is Botox because depending on frequency you can see the differences in the same calendar year.

"A disappointing, indecisive mind-numb film","This movie is about two bankrobbers and their three hostages who stop at a bar in Mexico. Once there all kinds of boring ""i-saw that-a-mile-away"" type things happen, as they fight against the dark forces who own and patronize the bar. For the first half this movie is a crime drama about the relationship between two brother bank robbers. Then, halfway through, it becomes a campy, shoot-em-up, blood and guts gore fest that totally forgets the first portion of the movie. This movie is to quirky to be horror, not funny enough to be dark comedy, and too strange to be anything else. If it is simply a man-vs-monster movie, then why the beginning bits with Richie and the first hostage, or the entire opening convenience store sequence? Why the incredibly lame (belongs in Wild Wild West) gun of Sex Machine? There are many scenes and developments that don't really fit in the movie.There were a couple of fun scenes in the movie, during the fights etc, but even those were not truly enjoyable as they really shortchange the vampire legacy. Since when do vampires explode when shot, or melt when stabbed? This movie is more akin to Buffy (without the wit or charisma of that show) then to anything remotely resembling the Count Dracula type vampires. George Clooney is good, along with Keitzel (sp?) but you know a movie is lame when the best thing about it is Seth Gecko's tattoo.A watchable movie, but only good if you are in an inebriated state.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"A perfect Friday night movie, but not much else.","Vampire movies are very hit or miss, as for every Nosferatu or Blade, there is a Twilight: Breaking Dawn or Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter rearing its ugly head around the corner. So, with a strong budget, cast and writing/directing team of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez behind it, how does this one fare? To be honest, very averagly, as despite some great things, there isn't much that this movie had to offer that many others have done already.The story is that criminal brothers Seth and Richard Gecko have recently broken out of prison and are travelling to Mexico to give their fellow gangsters some money. However, they encounter some problems, including kidnapping some hostages, trying to get across the US-Mexico border and how their meeting point with the aforementioned gangsters turns out to be full of vampires. Can they survive until dawn? The plot is very simple, and works for a B-movie homage like this, despite occasional plot holes here and there (i.e. why the vampires kill lorry drivers specifically).The plot isn't the only thing that's very shallow. Most of the characters are two-dimensional at best, with the standouts being George Clooney's Seth Gecko, as the character and Clooney oozes cool, and Harvey Kietel's father character, a widow who is desperately trying to look after his kids and the criminals, to the point where he will sacrifice his life for them. This makes him the character with the most depth in the movie, and Kietel plays him very well with an equal amount of boldness and restraint. The rest of the characters are slightly dull, but the actors do their best with weak material. The only dud here is Juliette Lewis, acting so robotic and lifeless, bringing none of the talent and charisma she had in Cape Fear, What's Eating Gilbert Grape and even Natural Born Killers.But the film isn't really concerned with plot or characters, but rather the mindless vampire action. After a good half an hour of talking and build up, the film turns into a series of vampire fights, which to be fair are quite cool. Robert Rodriguez is a brilliant action director, and this movie shows that off in spades, as the action scenes have good choreography and a quick pace, which make them enjoyable and fun to watch. The effects are also quite good as well, as despite the fact that a lot of CGI is used, are very impressive. The vampires themselves are quite unique as well, combining influences from films like The Evil Dead and The Thing as well as original ideas to create a truly unique set of creatures.However, the despite what fun you have watching the film, there isn't enough substance to reward multiple viewings. It's essentially junk food: it's nice enough and satisfies you for what it is, but is isn't anything substantial. I understand that the movie has a strong cult following, but to be honest, this is just a forgettable vampire film that doesn't offer you much outside of fun action and some good acting. It may be very appealing to you if you were a teenage boy who didn't know any better, but to be honest, the film isn't very good, and while it's fine for one watch, it doesn't really warrant repeat viewings for those looking for more depth. So overall, this is just a mediocre vampire film with occasional moments of brilliant here and there. Nothing more, nothing less. Still, it's a better Tarantino/Rodriguez collaboration than Four Rooms, I guess.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

"the unlikely marriage of ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) and ""Evil Dead"" (1981)","Sourced from a story Quentin Tarantino penned in his youth and dusted off in the wake of the ""Pulp Fiction"" impact, this Robert Rodriguez effort achieves this incredible hybrid. I must say I am uneven about the two authors of these credentials. For Tarantino, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Kill Bill: Volume I and II"" (2003/2004) and at a pinch ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) but ""Pulp Fiction"" isn't in my straitjacket of the most memorable movies made in the nineties. As for Sam Raimi, the ""Evil Dead"" saga hasn't got a prominent place in my favorite horror movies but ""a Simple Plan"" (1998) and the adventures of Peter Parker/Spider-Man gave me a positive side from him.I could have the same judgment about Rodriguez himself: I saw ""the Faculty"" (1999) when it was theatrically released and I forgot all about it. Ditto for ""Sin City"" (2005) which was visually a black splendor but I don't remember much about the story. On the positive side, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" entertained me until the last shot. It's cut in two distinct parts. The first one has more the look of a road-movie imbued with thriller with stunts, shootings, corpses galore and a dash of suspense. It's the part I favor the most. The second half of the film changes territory and takes a leap into the gore movie sourced from the eighties with blood, special effects to satisfy the genre. There is also a little of George A. Romero's masterwork ""the Night of the Living Dead"" (1968) and I do think this part is weaker than the first. The action becomes a bit sluggish and special effects are sometimes too intrusive. But perhaps, it was an inescapable rule to this kind of story.The amount is a film rooted in two different cinematographic genres and if it's a little hard to swallow, it means to jump on a genre while jettisoning the other, Rodriguez's effort has positive things in its contents to have a good time. Sequences are shot with care and shrewdness like the very first one. Like in ""Reservoir Dogs"", we won't properly see the bloody break-in but just verbal facts from the characters and the TV. It is also permitted to hail Tarantino for his sharp dialogs. My favorite lines are when George Clooney and Tarantino take Harvey Keitel and his son hostage and Juliette Lewis arrives in the room from the swimming pool:What's, um, going on? - We're having a bikini contest and you just won.Later in the van on the road that leads to Mexico:Where are you taking us? - Mexico - What's in Mexico? - Mexicans.Black humor shouldn't be neglected like the sequence when the journalist says the increasing number of killed people after the hold-up. And the actors seem to have fun as much as we do, notably Clooney and Tarantino in psychopathic killers who shoot first and ask themselves questions then.This B movie won't cater for all tastes for evident reasons but as it is painstakingly made as a whole, the alliance Rodriguez/Tarantino paid off well and it's a film to which I would return with pleasure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Instructions to watch From Dusk Till Dawn,"If you have never seen From Dusk Till Dawn, I think the experience will be more enjoyable for you if you follow these simple instructions:Put the DVD/Blu-Ray into the player and press ""Play""Yow will start watching a movie about two fugitive robbers, one of them a paranoid, sex-obsessed psycho, who cross paths with the family of a preacher who has lost his faith after the tragic death of his wife.Enjoy the tense and riveting thriller, which boasts some great dialogue, brilliant direction, and good performances from a cast that oozes charisma; even Tarantino does a decent job. (The only weak point is the Chinese lad who plays Harvey Keitel's son, and who seems incapable to convey any emotion whatsoever, but it's just a minor drawback.)When the characters arrive at the Titty Twister, you might notice the film starting to become a little corny, but don't worry, just hold on for a minute, the best scene of the movie is coming up.Marvel and drool at the phenomenal physique of Salma Hayek, whose body is so perfect in this movie she seem almost superhuman. Even if you're a lady, you will have to agree that her scene is definitely something out of the ordinary.As soon as the music ends and George Clooney says the famous line, ""Now that's what I call a f***ing show!"", STOP THE PLAYER.Not just stop the player, but eject the disc, put it in the box, and take it back to the video store right away. This is to avoid the temptation you might have to press ""PLAY"" again sometime later in the day, which you would regret.Now go for a walk, or sit in your favourite a bar with a drink, and try to imagine how the story might continue from that point on. Maybe Tarantino jumps on Juliette Lewis and forces Harvey Keitel to finally confront the brothers and bring them to justice (with the help of Satanico, who ironically turns out to be a devout Christian); maybe when Carlos arrives he turns out to be an undercover Mexican Federal working with the FBI and the brothers continue their escape taking the family (and Satanico) with them deeper into Mexico and becoming more and more desperate along the way; maybe ""Carlos"" double-crosses them and they are all forced to hole themselves up in the bar and fight together for their lives against the Mexican mob...but WHATEVER you come up with, I guarantee you this: it will be better than the absurd silliness that Tarantino and Rodriguez cooked up, ruining what could have otherwise been a very good film. Therefore, your viewing experience of From Dusk Till Dawn will be better than that of all the people who have had the misfortune of watching the whole thing from start to finish and witnessing how something that could have been great was trashed by a childish whim.You're welcome :-)",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Typical Tarantino sadistic incoherence,"I had nursed a mild interest in seeing this movie since it came out.I liked the energy of Desperado, though I despise the pointless, unfunny sadism of Tarantino. I knew he was in it, but I didn't know that he wrote it. I fast-forwarded through the first hour in which Clooney and Tarantino play sociopathic thieves. I wanted to see them both die. I do not find Tarantino's ""isn't it just NUTS that nice, innocent people get their brains spattered apart while scumbags live through it all??!?!? huh?!?!!?"" aesthetic very interesting, and that's what the first hour was. I kept saying to myself, well, is something going to HAPPEN in this movie? When the vampires finally do arrive, it is just pointless, seemingly unorchestrated attacks, one after another, until the end. I rented this not because I'm an art movie snob, but because I've been on a cheap horror jag, but throwing in all the best bits from all the other movies one has seen does not make a good movie itself. Even during the mayhem, this was BORING. It also seemed so DATED! It was like ""Oh yeah, the Tarantino 90s."" A friend of mine told me he watched Pulp Fiction, which he worshipped at the time, and it seemed really trite and lame now as well.

The action was good, the acting and suspense portrayed an action setting, until the last half of the movie. Which caught me completely by surprise. Rodriguez is famous for his artistic and crafty style of making movies and I gotta say, he did an outstanding job with this one. The hand-off from action thriller to a horror action film was so well-done I was impressed. I really enjoyed this movie, you can tell the director and cast members had fun making this film, and everything about this film is non-clichÃ© and an insane thrill ride from start to finish.

"This is a bad movie, but I love it anyway","Ok don't get me wrong, this movie could've been WAY worse. For what it is, it's actually a decent flick, but it's terrible at the same time.First I'll start with the acting. The acting is pretty bad. Tarantino is not a good actor, and he just looks awkward in his role. Luckily he plays a socially awkward character so he can get away with it this time. However the two actors that play the pastors (Jacob's) children were awful. The boy gave dialogue that looked like it was coming off a que card off screen. The girl sounded like she was forgetting her lines and then remembering them as she was speaking. Both actors sounded monotone and inorganic. Other actors just mumbled through their dialogue as if they'd never tried acting before. The one bright spot for the acting is Clooney. This is actually one of the best Clooney performances I've seen, because he carries the whole movie on his shoulders. There is little to run with in this movie, but he did it and somehow gave an awesome performance.
Next comes the rest. I couldn't help but notice awkward things in the movie that are generally found in B-movies. For example when characters are talking while fighting the vampires, in the background you can see vampires just standing there. They're not moving or trying to attack the characters, they're literally just standing there or waving a chair around for no reason.
All In all I loved this movie and am a fan of ridiculous movies in general. So I'll give this a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Superb,"Greetings from Lithuania.Imagine my surprise when nearly 20 years ago i was 11 years old and got a VHS copy (a highly good quality at the moment) of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". George Clooney was just a new and nice screen presents at the time and the many horror action flick were in the future. At the time i didn't know what was the true genre of this movie, thought it was going to be a nice thriller.For the most 50 min. it was actually a very well made thriller, with some hostages and a very likable main hero (or antagonist) and very basic plot line. But then, suddenly everything changed. At running time i think 55 min (didn't saw this movie in many many years now so sorry for inaccuracy) suddenly this thriller changed his genre in a moment, like probably no other flick till this date (02/05/2015) has ever did. From a heist thriller this became a monster movie, with NO earlier hints on that. NO hints. This is a rare as it can be. Tarantino? No. Yes and no. Even he prepares audience for a ride in a first minutes whatever wild roads it might take them. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was a different kind of beast. Gory, bloody, over the top, and bloody entertaining.Overall, if you haven't saw this flick, you probably won't be surprised of suddenly change in it's narrative during the ride because it's surely was spoiled many time already. Nevertheless, you should DEFINITELY see this flick as it delivers goods. All in or nothing - this flick delivers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Crime and horror, hell yes.","From the very first scene in this movie, I was hooked, and I could tell this was going to be a good and enjoyable film. And of course I was right. The story is pretty simple, but how it unfolds is the best part. It starts off as a crime drama. The dialogue is done in the usual Tarantino way. A lot of funny lines. The transition in the middle of the film was well done. One minute the Gecko brothers are having a good time, the next it's a complete splatter house.The Gecko brothers were fun to watch, and equally as amusing to listen to. Harvey Keitel's part was well played, same with the kids. Rodriguez regulars(Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin) are here as well. Even if they had a small part. Tom Savini is also present and he has some pretty funny moments as well.The fist half was a interesting crime drama, if it was like that the whole time I wouldn't have complained. The second have is all out mayhem and violence, loads of special effects.I highly recommend this, genre's were blended just right, and it leaves you satisfied after the credits roll.

Fun horror film,"From Dusk Till Dawn is a film that I have thoroughly fallen in love with after a few watches. Originally skeptical on my first watch, deciding to give it another chance from a different viewpoint has left me appreciating the film for what it is: a fun action horror romp that shouldn't be taken too seriously.Initially dismayed that the two halves of the film (the first half with the criminal brothers fleeing to Mexico with the kidnapped family, and the second fighting vampires within the bar) felt like they were duck-taped together, upon re-watches I find that it works surprisingly well, and by the end of the film the sudden twist is actually pretty funny. The script works well, as within the first half you feel the danger that the criminal brothers Seth and Richie Gecko (played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino respectively) poses to preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his family and the second half their fight against the vampires turns the film into a fun horror movie with some strong practical effects and quite cheesy parts that makes the second half all the more fun since it feels like the films wants you to have fun along with it.All of the characters work pretty well and the actors, particularly George Clooney and Harvey Keitel, do bring in good performances. The weakest actor would probably be Quentin Tarantino, but his performance does allow you to believe that he is his character and doesn't bring down the film. The side characters, played by Tom Savini and Fred Williamson are a delight to watch, and when talking about characters, Salma Hayek has to be mentioned for her character Santanico Pandemonium, probably the most iconic part of the film, so much so that when Netflix had created a TV show based on the film, Santanico is often on all the posters and promotional materiel.While part of me still laments the fact that the two parts of the film are not their own entities, I still enjoy the movie the film for what it is and have a damn fun time watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

"Stupid, stupid second half","My Age: 13Two criminal brothers, Seth and Richard Gecko, played by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, begin a crime spree driving through Texas, trying to get to Mexico where a man has promised them sanctuary in exchange for 30% of their stolen money.  To ensure that they get across the border, they take a preacher named Jacob Fuller, played by Harvey Keitel, and his two children, played by Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu, hostage.  Once they get across the border, they go to a bar called the Titty Twister where they encounter vampires.From Dusk Till Dawn starts off promisingly enough, with the plot of the two brothers on a crime spree, which takes up the first half of the movie. Until the vampires come in, the movie is quite good, enjoyable, and it makes sense.  The second half, however, when the vampire plot comes in just completely ruins the movie.  They just go to a bar and there are vampires. The movie gives you no reason why they are there, what their origins are, or how they came to being.  There is absolutely no plot in it, it is just killing, killing, and more brainless killing.  Everything that had been accomplished in the first half of the movie, including its plot, is just thrown out the window and replaced by stupidity and violence.  Why did they even bother with the first half's plot, when it is just going to be thrown away by the rest of the movie.  I enjoy violent action films a lot, but I didn't even enjoy seeing these vampires being gunned down countless times. The whole second half of the movie is set in only two rooms, and one of them for only about 5 minutes.  It would have been much better if they could have proceeded into the depths of the building to encounter the vampires.  I wish they had made this into two movies.  The first half's plot would have made for an impressive movie by itself, and if the second half's vampire plot had been stretched into one movie by itself, it may have had time to proceed into the depths of the building, explain where they came from and why they were there.  Just think of all the talent wasted in this movie: George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, Salma Hayek, Ernest Liu, Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez.

"Entertaining, Quirky but not the greatest.","I found that this movie almost offered too much to be true when I first read about it.  Tarantino alone would make me watch this movie, not considering the draw power that Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis have over me in terms of other great films they have both been in.  I was unsure of how George Clooney would act in a role written by Tarantino, but to my surprise he handled it very well.  I felt that Clooney and Keitel pulled together the entire film as it was dangering close to falling apart.I enjoyed Tarantino's screen play and his acting as well as they both offered a unique style of quirky humour that only Tarantino can deliver. The movie did alter extremely suddenly at one point, which I knew was approaching but I was disappointed as I had begun to like the charismatic start to the film and the dialogue of the characters.I'd say that this film is entertaining, its definately worthy of a few watches but I'm yet to be convinced on both Vampire movies and movies directed by Robert Rodriguez.

A Texas Ranger pulls into a gas station and makes everyday chit-chat with the cashier. And then, before you know it, people are getting shot, the gas station is exploding, and the opening credits start. Even though the opening is excellent, the second half of the movie is not as good as the first half.""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by his good friend Robert Rodriguez. Both of their famous trademarks are made in the movie. The story is of two criminal brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) who drive across Texas taking hostages (Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis) and hope to make it across the border to a rendezvous at a bar. But what they find is a bar where the customers come straight from Hell.Like I said early, the first half of the movie is excellent. It begins as the coolest movie I have ever seen. What more could you ask for? You've got George Clooney, one of the coolest actors today, in a film done by two of the coolest guys in Hollywood (and one of them is even in the movie!). And Salma Hayek is the sexiest woman on the planet! After seeing her dance, I completely forgot why they were even at the bar. But then....it happened: The Vampires.

Reservoir Dogs vs. Mexican Vampires,"Incredibly fun genre mash-up from director Robert Rodriguez (""Desperado"" ""The Faculty"" ""Spy Kids"") and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino (""Pulp Fiction"" ""Kill Bill"" ""Hateful Eight""). In what is best described as Reservoir Dogs vs. Mexican Vampires, a pair of low-life criminals, The Gecko Brothers, handsome leader George Clooney and creepy sex offender little brother Tarantino, are on the lamb and headed for Mexico when they kidnap Harvey Keitel and family, Juliette Lewis and her brother, to help them sneak across the border in their RV. One thing that makes this film so fun is that the first half is a pretty straight crime film, but it takes a hard genre turn towards horror when our heroes stop off at a seedy strip club to celebrate their successful border crossing, finding themselves in an establishment run by vampires intent on locking everyone inside and feast upon their blood. From there, the film turns from crime film into a ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""Assault on Precinct 13"" style siege film (a nod to which is made by one character wearing a ""Precinct 13"" t-shirt). I remember a friend of mine watching this film with no idea what it was about or there were any horror elements to the film and had his mind completely explode when the bar employees and strippers all of a sudden start turning into vampires, which I thought was hilarious since there is nothing in the first half of the film to indicate that vampires are coming. The second half of the film is pretty heavy on action and vampire slaying, so there's not as much snappy Tarantino dialogue, but is still fun non-the-less. There's also a very cool supporting cast of character that show up in the vampire club including Salma Hayek as a stripper named Santanico Pandemonium, Cheech Marin in three different roles, Danny Trejo as Razor Charlie, Tom Savini as sex Machine, Greg Nicotero, and the always great Fred Williamson. Some other memorable supporting players who appear prior to the vampire bar are John Saxon, Marc Lawrence, Kelly Preston, John Hawkes, and Michael Parks. There's also some fun crossovers moments to other Tarantino and Rodriguez films including Michael Park's Earl McGraw later becoming a recurring character in ""Kill Bill,"" ""Planet Terror,"" and ""Death Proof"". There's also Chango Beer and Sex Machine's codpiece gun that reference ""Desperado."" Big Kahuna Burgers from ""Pulp Fiction"" also make an appearance and would later reappear in ""Death Proof."" Clooney also borrows a line from ""Reservoir Dogs"" with ""All right, Ramblers. Let's get ramblin'!"" Oh, and Tarantino's trademark foot fetish is also present. So for fans of Rodrigues and Tarantino movies, this one is hard to resist. For non-fans, you may not love it as much, but it's still goofy crime and horror film fun. FUN FACT!

A Black Comedy turned Nightmare,"This film is perhaps most famous for its twist about halfway through the story. It is quite a twist on the film's reality, I'd say comparable to the one in ""The Matrix"" in that absolutely nothing is the same after. Also, like in the aforementioned film, the twist makes sense... but only if looked at from a certain point of view.The story goes from a caper black comedy with a pair of crooks who are on their way to Mexico to escape US law enforcement. They take some hostages and narrowly slip through the border and to a meeting point, a bar with exotic dancers. It seems that their dreams are just about to come true and they'll be sipping margaritas safe from the confines of prison... but then what happens? Our very frightened protagonists find themselves locked in the bar, that is now basically a prison, but it is not run by law enforcement officers, it's worse. It's not even run by the Gestapo... it's worse! No, this place is worse than their worst nightmares and too bad for them that it is real, since it seems everyone has been given an automatic death sentence. The bar is run by vampires who feast on visitors in order to stay alive.Is the twist odd? Yes, very much so, but with a screenplay by Quentin Tarantino, only some sort of off the wall unconventional twist can be expected. Tarantino himself has a supporting role as the very weird and deranged brother of George Clooney's character. At this point Tarantino was known for crime capers and to an extent this is one too, but it fits into Tarantino's list of movies the way his character is in the film: a total weirdo with a penchant for violence. Also Robert Rodriguez has yet to make something quite like this as well...Overall, this is an odd and very violent movie that is decidedly not for all tastes, but it's dark wit and sense of humor cannot be denied.

"Insane, Gory Fun","This is a wild, crazed, demented, sick, loud, gore-splattered, profanity-laden, explosion-heavy, hot and sexy vampire film. It's also a lot of fun if you can stomach all the previously mentioned elements.Seth and Richard Gecko (played by George Clooney and the amazing Quentin Tarantino) are fugitives on their way to Mexico amid a storm of bullets and fire. After hijacking a motor home and the nice family it belongs to (jaded ex-minister Harvey Keitel, daughter Juliette Lewis and son Ernest Liu) the strange group is heading for a notorious Mexican strip joint called The Titty Twister. Unfortunately, the group has no way of knowing that the bar is staffed by some really nasty vampires.Some of my favorite people are in this odd little flick: the aforementioned Tarantino (who has never done anything that I don't like), the amazing Keitel (totally cast against type here and doing an amazing job as always), the smolderingly beautiful Salma Hayek, playing the sinuously sexy dancing vampire Satanica Pandemonium, and Cheech Marin, who actually has three roles in this movie but who stands out as the doorman of the Titty Twister, enthusiastically announcing all the varieties of, um, women and their sexual organs to be found within. It's absolutely hysterical...but only if you're not easily offended by the common nickname for house cats being used to describe the female genitalia. Quentin Tarantino also does an outstanding job in his role as the delusional Richard, who imagines he hears crude come-ons from any and every woman he spends too much time around. Keep an eye out for early evidence of his now notorious foot fetish in the scene he shares with Salma, her white snake (nice Bram Stoker touch, by the way) and her bare feet.The violence is explosive and virtually non stop by the third act. The make-up effects by Tom Savini (who also has a role as a biker named Sex Machine) are pretty damn cool, but as with every film that Tarantino has touched, the real action lies within the words spoken by the actors. The script is fast and clever and as incredibly funny as it is offensively sick. This is half vampire film, half Spaghetti western with a little Reservoir Dogs thrown in for good measure. And it's really damn fun too. Fans of Tarantino should enjoy this, and vampire fans tired of the same old formulaic films might just enjoy this odd side road into new territory. The easily offended should stay far away. The rest of us without an ounce of PC will be laughing our tasteless butts off.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
This is a blast,"This is a great piece of pure entertainment. It's perhaps a bit unusual that my favourite two Tarantino movies weren't directed by Tarantino. This was directed by Robert Rodriguez, whilst True Romance was directed by Tony Scott. What starts out as a classic criminals on the run turns into a vampire movie. So, you get two movies for the price of one and you're out of the theatre in under two hours. The whole cast seem to be having a blast with this and the combination of thrills, spills and excellent script will leave you breathless.

A guilty pleasure...,"To put it mildly, this movie isn't for everyone. It's full of graphic violence, strong language, and topless women. With all that in mind, I find it a real hoot!The important thing is, do not, under any circumstances, take it seriously. Just sit back, relax, and have fun with it. Show it at a party, perhaps. Make sure you're in the right mood.I cannot overemphasize how awesome the cast is. Tarantino isn't much of an actor, but he's great fun here. My favorite scene is when he's hallucinating that Juliette Lewis' character is coming on to him, saying something unprintable here-how I wish I could type it! George Clooney and Harvey Keitel come off best. They play their roles as seriously as possible, as a hilarious counterbalance to the pervading goofiness. And you know what? They actually make us care what happens to them!Overall: pretty cool, although even I thought it was a bit much in parts-but that's an intended effect.Movie Fun Fact: Cheech Marin plays three roles.

Fun and provocative movie.,"This movie is not for people looking for a serious film, but fun, provocative. Salma Hayek was very beautiful with her snake dance. The funny thing is that she hates snakes. I wonder how they got her to dance with that huge yellow snake. This movie was done pre-Fools Rush In, and I only recently began watching her films before Fools Rush In. She was great in Desperado and in this film as well, although, her part was fairly minuscule. I hope she continues to do well. Its amazing that she is nearly 40 and her body and looks have maintained a 25 year oldish look. If you have seen After The Sunset, you'll know what I mean. I'd recommend this movie to those who don't get offended early and just want to watch Salma with her snake dance. All in all, this movie is more than OK but not great. I give it a 6.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
A script and character triumph unashamedly wrapped in glorious nonsense.,"When this film came out all I remember is that it was 'the' go to film for all things cool.The plot wasn't a surprise as the trailers pretty much gave everything away but the decade was still buzzing from Tarantino fever and after the superb 'Desperado' the teaming of Robert Rodriguez and his screen writing chum doing a film about vampires was too much pull for a 17 year old me.I can say without a doubt that it is a classic. Maybe not in the sense of Casablanca or Raiders Of The Lost Ark but as a style film it really can't be touched.Tarantino's screenplay drips with wit and humour as well as the usual taboo subjects thrown into everyday conversation and Rodriguez direction compliments this. Both men have made 'looking tacky' an art form when it comes to film and this heavily works in it's favour because we want it to feel sleazy and a bit dirty. Rodriguez has made some right stinkers in his time but in this era he was what I consider to be a proper fimmaker with no CGI and not much of a budget which pushes directors to be as creative as possible.The cast is about as good as it gets. George Cloony, who audiences were used to seeing as a respectable Doctor on the hit Series ER does a complete character 180 into the superb Seth Gecko a character with all the moral fibre of a rock and the patience of a 5 year old. He tears into the script like a hungry dog which showcases whole new side to Cloony's acting and who could forget 'that' tattoo, a tiny detail which really brought the visual impact of the character to life and has since been copied many times but back then it was a striking feature. It's probably safe to say that this film was a game changer for Cloony who gained new respect for such a radical change but sadly hasn't really done much else that comes close.As a few people have mentioned this is really two films in one, the first being a superb crime drama which sees the Gecko boys escape over the border with a kidnapped family, and the second is pure schlock nonsense and I am totally fine with that.Maybe it was the teenager in me when I saw this but nothing could make me or my pals smile more than a bit of blood, guts and vampires interlaced with ridiculous humour.Some say the vampire section brings the crime thriller down but I think the thriller part raises the profile of what is already a really cool film.So many people go by formulas, right ways to do things and rules. Where art is concerned and this includes film, music etc. there can only be guidelines and it's great to see a bunch of people making a film the way they want to make it and that means throwing whatever off beat, off topic nonsense they feel like into the mix just because they simply think it would be cool.A superb and sleazy trashcan of a movie that's not afraid to play with childish notions because it knows it's a cut above most film snobs polished favourites.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
...Not as bad as I remember it being...,"I just got done watching From Dusk Til Dawn on TV, and I've got to say, it was much better than when I watched it on video a few year's back at a friend's house. While George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino's acting jobs were utterly horrendous, Juliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel, as usual, were fantastic. However, they could not save this movie. It has an incredibly thin plot, and no character development. I must say the censors at Fox did a great job taking out all the breasts and swearing. I seem to remember Clooney saying three four letter words for every normal word. And the name of the bar on TV was the Kitty Twister, and I seem to remember it being named something *slightly* different when I saw it on video. If it really did have that slightly different name in the uncensored movie, one must really give credit to Fox' censors, as even the LOGO for the bar said Kitty Twister. From Dusk Til Dawn is a bad movie. Unfortunately it takes itself far too seriously to even be laughably bad. Fortunately Fox had the good nature to intersperse the film with commercials every 10 minutes to break up the monotony. On video you won't be quite so lucky.

Etc., etc.If you read through the reviews here, you may come to the conclusion that I simply didn't understand Tarantino's point or his artistic vision. Please. He HAD no point or vision. He had some money to make a movie and apparently felt smug enough about his own reputation that he could simply throw in whatever scenes interested him.

Enough of the 'cool' crap. Please.,"I did not realize exactly how much I detest this film until I saw it again last night. The sight of Tarantino with a gun just makes me want to smash my own television. The sight of Tarantino killing someone makes me want to cry with despair at the state of the film industry. I can only hope that one day George Clooney faints with the genuine realization he chose to be involved in this heinous vile film. Why cannot other people see Tarantino as I see him and his awful cretinous mutilation and degradation films? I cannot be the only one. Every film he makes is sheer humiliation violence towards women. They are not 'cool'. They are designed to ridicule violently every character because Tarantino sets out to defile everyone and everything because he cannot create. He is a destroyer: of images of beauty, of the human form and I am sick of hearing how 'cool' he is and that the films he makes are 'cool'. Clearly every woman in his films and especially this one are simply there for him to manhandle and humiliate, defile and then to kill... that is if he does not get to have rough sex with them first. The scene in the motel with Gloria the hostage who is crying with fear... she gets used as a gun gag and her brains are splattered on the wall. This is so vile and so cruel and especially that as a character in this film she is a middle aged woman, someone's mum and an ordinary woman. Tarantino's psycho character encourages her to relax so he can rape her then blast her face off. This apparently is funny. Hence my rousing identification of the true destructive and defiling nature of this rotten film. The showgirls in the Titty Bar are shown hacked up and tossed in a heap...because all beautiful women in Tarantino films really are monsters and if you don't f**k em first you'd better kill em. Tarantino's films are specifically designed by him to simply rip to shreds anything that is humane and beautiful and of value. His film world is one of emotional and physical brutality and the sheer obvious hatred of women of all ages. FROM DUSK TILL DAWN is a vile cinematrocity and should be studied for what it truly is. The scene where Harvey Keitel is begging his kids to murder him is just an atrocity on every standard of life any society holds with value. In this film Tarantino has written it as a part of his 'wacky adventure in the dirt'. Next time you have an accident in the street and lay bleeding in terrible pain and some pitiless passerby by says. ""ooh cool' as you pass out from the pain.. think of how well Tarantino has infected their psyche and eroded their humanity via his assault on society by films like this.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

I will just say this, the movie is truly great until they get into that damn bar. Then it's just downhill, and I wonder why script-writer Tarantino did it like so. Because the movie is too cool from the start. Brothers Seth and Richie Gecko are famous bank-robbers and are on the run. They are responsible for a truck-load of deaths, and they have to escape. They choose the family of priest Jacob Fuller to accomplish it. The showcase of Tarantinian trademark dialogue is genius, with many fantastic dialogue to show in the respective quote section. As I said before, the movie is really a great movie until they get to that bar, where all hell breaks loose (literally). The makers of this movie should really have a fetish for B-Movies, since all I can say is that they really made it like so, and I am talking about everything, even the special effects. You'll see for yourself, but you are warned: when they cross that door, the movie gets really B-Grade, and never recovers.

Bloody good fun.,"Two desperate criminals take a family hostage in order to escape to Mexico; once safely over the border, they head for sleazy strip-bar The Titty Twister, unaware that the establishment is home to a nest of vampires who feed upon the clientÃ¨le.Fans of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino certainly get their money's worth with From Dusk Till Dawn: not one, but two genresâgratuitously violent crime action followed by over-the-top horror; a smart script that contains just the right amount of cool, quotable, quick-fire dialogue (as opposed to the overlong boring monologues that QT can sometimes be guilty of); sexiness in the delightful forms of Juliette 'Jailbait' Lewis and Salma 'Salsa Hot' Hayek; fantastic splattery gore from effects gods KNB; and a superb cast that includes George Clooney (proving he can play 'bad'), the always dependable Harvey Keitel, plus cult movie legends John Saxon, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini, Danny Trejo, and Cheech Marin.Still firing on all cylinders from his El Mariachi sequel hit Desperado, director Rodriguez ensures that From Dusk Till Dawn is an absolute blast from explosive start to blood-drenched finish, packing the film with wall-to-wall mayhem, stylish visuals, macabre comedic touches (watch for the hilarious bit where one vamp is killed on a pool table and his eyeballs roll into the corner pockets), and cool Tex Mex rock music. And although the story borrows heavily from other films at timesâmost notably, 80s teen horror Vampâit matters not a jot: I'm sure you'll be having far too much fun to care!After all, who could fail to enjoy a film that features a biker named Sex Machine (who is armed with a spring-loaded crotch cannon), a sexy dance scene starring the gorgeous Hayek (who allows lucky old Tarantino to indulge in his foot fetish), Juliette Lewis requesting oral pleasure, George Clooney revving a pneumatic stake, Marin listing the wide variety of pussy available in The Titty Twister, and buckets and buckets of juicy, top-quality gore?

Great combination in this movie!,"Another Quentin Tarantino hit is here. This is dealing with the world of Vampires. What is it? ""From Dusk till Dawn"". You got two dangerously deadly brothers on the run from law enforcement officers.

When Seth loses it when his brother Richard rapes and kills the teacher they kidnapped. That makes Seth mad at him all right, he would probably kill his brother as well. So they ditch that nice Mercury for a RV containing a widower(Harvey Kitel) and kids(Juliette Lewis,Ernest Liu). I don't know what goes on in the mind of Richard but Seth keeps his cool at all times. When the group goes South of the Border, it's an all-night truck stop. Giving to the term tourist trap. It's a trap all right. When this tavern is owned by blood-sucking vampires, there was no time for these people to scurry. The killers knew what they were up against. So the family help the killers and the other tourists rid themselves of these pests, sadly some of them fell victim to the blood-suckers.

Pleasure turns into a night of hell....which is great for me to watch!,"My favorite director is of course Quentin Tarantino, and although he did not direct this movie he acted in it and wrote it. The director Robert Rodriguez took a unique story and made it gory, thrilling, and at points just ridiculous. The story centers around two thugs that have recently broke out of jail and are heading to Mexico for freedom. Along the way they cause destruction and death, and take a preacher and his kids hostage. While they enter Mexico they stay at a place called ""Titty Twister"" and what they thought was going to be a night of pleasure turns into a night of survival. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" has a great cast consisting of some of Rodriguez's usual like Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin, but the main stars are Quentin Tarantino, George Clooney, Juliette Lewis, and Harvey Keitel. Girls if you are looking for Clooney to be like he usually is, sappy and handsome, you will be disappointed. This in my opinion is Clooney's most unique role, he is frankly a bastard in ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". If you are looking for a amazing movie that you will fall in love with, this might not be it.

"I'm Sex Machine, pleased to meet yaÂFrom Dusk Till Dawn","This year's Grindhouse was not the first of such collaborations between Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. One could argue that their production of From Dusk Till Dawn laid the seeds for that schlock-fest extravaganza. I remember while watching Planet Terror thinking how overboard Rodriguez was going, and loving every minute of it. Revisiting this film, however, showed how he didn't stray too far from where he had already been. Sure Tarantino's dialogue is at the forefront for much of the film's duration, but when the action amps up and the vampire gore starts splattering, one can see the connection with Rodriguez's later film. Overall, this movie delivers big time. The laughs are many, the pop culture references are sprinkled throughout, the characters are all fully fleshed no matter how little screen time they are given, and the action is great to watch.The story is a simple one. The Gecko brothers have pulled off a heist and need to get to Mexico in order to pay off their partner. They kill and steal along the way until meeting up with a pastor who has lost faith and his two children in an RV. Taking the family hostage, they make their way south to a sleazy topless bar awaiting said partner's arrival. This specific bar, however, is inhabited by vampires who feed on its customers once the sun goes down. What is first a crime tale of men on the run soon turns into a fight for survival against the supernatural.While Rodriguez handles the directing well, showcasing some nice special effects and make-up work, it really is the script that shines. Tarantino has crafted a tale with just enough realism to keep it from going too far overboard. The dialogue is sharp and with himself and George Clooney starring, the delivery is spot-on. Quentin's Richard is a lunatic, pedophile/rapist who recently broke his brother Seth out of jail so they could complete this job. Seth is the brains of the operation and understands all the angles. His temper leads to many great one-liners and his release of tension when they cross the border successfully gives us even more. The relationship between the two is classic and I don't see Tarantino giving a better performance ever. His low-key psychopath is effective and I love his soft delivery of lines when his brother is not in the room to hear him.Our entry point into the film opens the action perfectly with what on the surface appears to be a generic scene between a sheriff and a gas station proprietor. When the officer goes to the bathroom we are finally able to meet the Gecko boys and understand what is really happening. Richard goes crazy, Seth shows his vindictive side, and John Hawkes is brilliant as the man stuck in the middle, doing what he is told, but subverted at all times by Richard's bloodlust. The rest of the film, until they meet the family that sticks with them to the end is full quality dialogue and acting. That family consists of Harvey Keitel, great in a role that is uncommon for himÂthe good guy, Ernest Liu as the son, with a nice realistic turn, and Juliette Lewis as the daughter, giving many memorable moments, especially opposite Tarantino.It's when they arrive at the Mexican bar and the vampires show themselves that the film really picks up. The script remains witty, but the supernatural flair infused with it brings a freshness that keeps the film from ever hitting a rut. Cameos are plenty, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek, Tom Savini, and Fred Williamson among others, blood and guts are everywhere, and the violence rises to a crescendo. Clooney is allowed to run free, to great effect, with Keitel there at all times injecting a bit of calm wisdom whenever possible. From Dusk Till Dawn is far from a masterpiece, but it is fantastic entertainment and can be played with Grindhouse to create a highly enjoyable night of carnage.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

But unbeknown st to the brothers or their hostages, the management and staff of this particular establishment have a taste for blood--in the vampire sense.The opening of this movie is total different to the rest of the movie as starts of like something in gangster movie.I am NOT a huge fan of vampire movies,, i just can get into then,, the one I have seen are Samles lot and 30 Days of Night l like those movies , I have also tired to watch blade movies, i just can not get to that all and now back to this movie.This as great scary vampires in this movie, i really liked how they changed out the blue sometimes, which make the movie really scary and some of deaths scenes were really good.This movie as some great Amazing Special Effects which were really Gory and some of transformation are really great and the make up effects for the vampires were really good and made they look really scary.There do have a lot of blood and gore in this movie and a lot of nudity (but not overboard) and they add some nice humour into this movie too, there are some really funny scenes in this movie which will make you laugh.The acting in this movie is really good from the whole cast. I going to give this movie 9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Soul-Suckingly Good,"From Dusk Till Dawn is a bad-ass horror comedy. A blood drenched good time, with an amazing script written by, who else but Tarantino? It felt like two separate films, which is the coolest and strangest thing about it. It's a violent crime drama for the first hour, and then a wild horror comedy for the last half hour. Some call it indecisive, but when you tell Tarantino to make a horror film, this is the exact thing he'd come up with. The only thing is, if it were directed by him, it would've been such a masterpiece. Without him in control of every aspect of production, it just seems like something is missing. Robert Rodriguez isn't exactly a great director, and sometimes, you can see that here. Bad CGI anyone? Ah, who cares? I enjoyed the hell out to this thing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
From Dusk Till Dawn (1996),"Directed by Robert Rodriguez. Starring George Clooney, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Juliette Lewis, Ernest Liu, Cheech Marin, Salma Hayek, Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, Danny Trejo, Michael Parks, John Hawkes. (R)Sibling bank robbers (Clooney, Tarantino) racing for the border take Keitel and his family hostage, their destination a scuzzy Mexican strip bar in the middle of nowhere that (unfortuitously) happens to be a den of monstrous bloodsuckers. As much a tale of two halves as ""Grindhouse"" was (in half the time); for about an hour, it's a nihilistically hip Tarantino crime picture, then it transforms on a dime into a trashy vampire gore-comedy delivered in Rodriguez's in-your-face style. Modestly enjoyable junk has attitude to spare as well as some respectable blood-and-guts special effects and makeup (not to mention enough boundless creativity to negate any attempt at logic/rules-of-lore in the frenetic back end), but a little more restraint and/or better staging would have served it better. In his first role since breaking through on TV's ""ER,"" Clooney proves he has the screen presence and unforced charisma to be a legitimate movie star; Tarantino doesn't fare nearly as well, but it's still one of his least obtrusive showings in front of the camera. Sultry Hayek, wearing little besides a giant snake, steals the whole movie, of course.69/100",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Amazing,"Yes, This movie is amazing.  I have never been so incredibly taken aback by a movie in all my years of film-watching.

lousy,"I tell some of this movie so if you ain't seen this movie than don't read this review. I have always enjoyed watching scary vampire movies for entertainment.  You know, movies like the 1931 Classic Dracula where Doctor Van Helseing hunts Dracula to end his reign of terror? Or, what about John Carpenter's ""Vampires"", where the slayers find the nest, awake the bloodsuckers and the vampires are steaked and baked! I knew the movie ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" was a vampire flick so I watched it.  But, after watching it, I realized there was something different in this flick then just a vampire movie. Let me explain what I mean. I'm leaving the actors names out because you can see them on this sight or the other viewers reviews. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" begins with a genuine All-American hero, a Texas Ranger by the name of Earl McGraw who is tough and ready to go after two outlaws, the Gecko's, who escaped from prison.  Ranger McGraw enters an isolated Texas liquor store where he speaks to the clerk about the situation of the escaped felons.  He buys a beer and goes to the restroom totally unaware that in the back of the same liquor store the outlaws are holding two hostages at gunpoint.  The Ranger then returns from the restroom with his back to the outlaws.  He begins his conversation with the clerk where within an instant he is shot in the back of the head in a cold, cowardly act of murder.  Falling to the ground, he is repeatedly shot.  Afterwards, the outlaws murder the clerk and the world of liquor goes up in flames.  From there the outlaws rape and mutilate an innocent woman.  All of this happens in the first few minutes of the movie. The outlaw Gecko brothers then take a family hostage in their RV and cross into Mexico.  There they are to meet an associate Mexican druglord at a bar, the Titty Twister, a bar that is owned by bloodsucking vampire goons.  From there on, there are more unsavory charactors getting crazy and that's before the vampires even attack.  But, when they do attack, boy do they ever!  It is some of the most satanic, evil, bloodsucking vampires that I have ever seen in a movie. The makeup man and one of the writer's of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is Robert Kurtzman.  This dude must be one of Hollywoods best horror, gory makeup artists.  He has been a makeup artist for John Carpenter's ""Vampires"" and 2001 movie ""Thirteen Ghosts"" and thats just a couple of the many scary ones.                                        The trouble with ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is the entire movie is that I wanted to see the Gecko brothers get killed as bad as any bloodsuckin vamp-goons and thats pretty bad.  What I discovered is deeper than just a vampire flick.  ""From Dust Till Dawn"" is typical Hollywood verses the backbone of America with the unnecessary vicious murder of a Texas Ranger and two other murders.  Robert Rodriguez, Robert Kurtzman and Quentin Tarantino show their disrespect for law and order, decency, morality and their outright hatred for our American heroes! Out of a scale of 1-10, I give this movie ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" a big, fat zero.  Thats 0 out of 10!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Classic humour,"Despite having to forgive their choices for some of the horrendous cgi at the beginning of the film and some of the unnecessary story adding which filled the first half of the film, I found the film absolutely hilarious. Classic sense of humour which I feel I would enjoy no matter my age (maybe maturity) and no matter who I am accompanied by. Would definitely watch again for a quick laugh at the end of a rough and long day. Despite my high level of enjoyment I am still unsure of how they could continue the story line for sequel films without presenting what would seem like a simple and unoriginal repeat of the original. Overall I gave a seven as I believe highly humorous it contained time wasting story fillers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
This movie sucks...and bites...and chews...and gnaws.,"Another Tarantino no-brainer exploitation film, ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" tells of a couple of bad guys on the run who hook up with a family and end up in a Mexican truck-stop strip joint doing battle with Vampires. The story is lame, the screen play boring nonsense, and the film is a redundant mess until the un-dead meet up with the really un-dead and battle it out in a major Vampire vs Human bloodbath. The only value here is some cool effects as Vampires explode, morph, melt, and burst into flames. Recommended for mature audiences with not so mature taste in film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

First half is fun!,"I enjoyed this movie very much. The pairing of clooney and Tarantino resulted in unexpected fun and unpredictability. The only problem with the movie that i could find was the sudden switch from reality-action to fantasy-horror, which happened in seconds and made the second half of the movie faster paced and unrealistic. I think that Rodriguez had a hard time choosing between a film about reality or fiction and that is where the movie fails.Myself being used to Rodriguez and Tarantino twists found it typical of their writing style, but to others unfamiliar with some of their work the movie's second half might seem rushed and filled with gore for the sake of gore.I praise Clooney and Tarantino for the flick's first half, their characters were believable and intense!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
a very good movie,"Seth Gecko and his younger brother Richard are on the lam after a bloody bank robbery in Texas. They escape across the border into Mexico and will be home-free the next morning, when they pay off the local kingpin. They just have to survive 'from dusk till dawn' at the rendezvous point, which turns out to be a Hell of a strip joint. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino(who is also one of my favorite directors was very good in this movie)Salma Hayek was very sexy there. The film begins in a liquor store where Seth and Richie hold two girls hostage while attempting to get Pete Bottoms, the clerk, to get rid of Texas Ranger Earl McGraw, who has entered the store. Just as McGraw is about to leave, he is shot in the head by Richie, thinking that Pete has mouthed ""help us."".a lot of action good acting and funny scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Really weird but really fun,"First half of this movie is a classic Quentin Tarantino crime filler, mass amount of violence for almost no reason, really dark and on point comedy and many moments involving his foot fetish. The story is also really interesting it involves fugitives on the run, with lots of hostage situations on man whose trying to cleanly get away with it and his partner who is completely insane. The film is actually really tense and the plot is great. A normal family is introduced into the plot and they're all really likeable and add a lot of much needed humanisation to the story. And then the plot completely changes in the second half to a gore fest vampire film. Honestly despite how different the contrast in genre and tone is I do really like it, the characters are perfect for this type of film and because of the first half building up these characters it makes the second half even funnier and also more tense as you actually somewhat care for these characters. Part of me does wish we could get more of the first half as the characters and plot is really well done and there's a lot you could do with it however, I'm glad we got this film as the second half is just so incredibly enjoyable. The gore in this film is also really enjoyable almost all of it uses practical effect and they do some really creative and fun deaths especially with the vampires, my biggest issue is probably how weak the vampire actually are, but with just how fun the action is it's barely a problem and the film itself is very entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

An entertaining ride with a little too much excess,"From Dusk till Dawn is a campy and crazy film. The excessive violence, nudity, and language are distracting, though--this movie might have been stronger if it used more restraint--but it was still a fun ride.

A contemptible mess,"This is a truly repugnant film on many levels, but perhaps mostly in the character played by Tarantino.

More ironic trash for the nerds.,"If you can get past the fact that Clooney and Tarantino are in this, and if you are able to ignore utter nonsense - which mostly takes place in the last half-hour - this is for you. Good effects, utterly moronic characters.You can just tell how much Tarantino enjoys to cast himself along a ""jock hot guy"" like Clooney, being the nerd that he is, with a huge chip on his shoulder, wanting since his adolescence to belong to the ""hip"" beautiful people crowd. (His early - very cringy - TV appearances are very telling.)Consists of two very different movies. Tarantino failed to make it a cohesive unit, or perhaps wanted a mess. Whichever it was, he never was about cohesiveness, just shock value, because he's such a desperate obsessed-with-violence nerd. Once the 2nd movie starts, all the characterization previously established disintegrates.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Probably one of the most awesome movies ever made.,"In my opinion there are only 3 movies in the world that are really underrated/misunderstood; ""Mars Attacks!"", ""Starship Troopers"" and this movie. It makes me mad and sad when any of those movies gets flamed for all the wrong reasons.Yes, this movie is pulp, just the way as it was intended to. Robert Rodriguez is just a big movie-nut who also happens to make movies himself. He makes movies obviously for the fun of it, where profits and budgets don't seem to be his biggest priority. He just makes the movies he wants to and enjoys doing, they way he wants to. He's of course not the only director in the business that does this but he perhaps is the only director that also has the right connections while doing so. It makes Rodriguez unique in its sort and also one of the best and most enjoyable directors in the business.Amazing how many famous and respected actors actually agreed to appear in this movie. Guess it truly helps when you're friends with Quentin Tarantino and his name gets attached to the project as well. Would Harvey Keitel or Juliette Lewis else would really ever do a movie like this? Also a really gutsy move to case George Clooney in the most tough and carrying role of the movie. He still had his 'be good' ""ER"" image all written over him at the time. It wasn't until after this movie that he really got token serious as an actor and got cast in big production movies such as ""Batman & Robin"", ""The Peacemaker"" and ""Three Kings"".The story is totally original, in its own twisting and weird way. The first part of the movie the movie seems like a crime movie in which two brothers are on the run. However from the moment the character enter the Titty Twister bar in Mexico it turns 360 degrees, spins 3 more time and makes a barrel-role. That's how it best can be described. The movie becomes an extremely gory and ridicules vampire-flick, in which all the gloves are off. This movie is basically the ultimate dream for every B-movie type of horror lover. Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are obviously also two of them. They really didn't needed to make this movie, Quentin Tarantino had some big and respectable successes with ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", prior to this movie and Robert Rodriguez just had his big breakthrough with ""Desperado"". They just made this movie because they could and they really wanted to.The movie does have some great tough characters and the script has some good dialog in it, with some great humor as well. Not necessarily the typical sort of Tarantino sort of dialog but great nevertheless, in a different kind of way. He obviously had fun writing this movie, by putting in as many crazy and gory elements in it as possible. But the movie is still of course mostly a Rodriguez movie, made in his typical 'Mexican' sort of style, that is consistent with his earlier movies ""El Mariachi"" and ""Desperado"".The movie is kept deliberately simple and silly. It enhances the fun incredibly and this might very well be also one of the most fun movies I have ever seen. It's delicious pulp, without any intentions. It's made purely to entertain and on top of the that, it's first class made, with people such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez involved and it has a great respectable cast in it, with persons that above all are very well cast into their roles. Most of them also seem to be in this movie just for the fun of it, which really shows on the screen. It helps to make the movie work and make it all the more entertaining to watch. Actors such as Danny Trejo and Cheech Marin of course also show up as always is the case in a Robert Rodriguez and the Salma Hayek cameo role is already sort of a classic and while leave the fan-boys drooling.The movie does not have the greatest special-effects or make-up, though the small details of the movie are done really good, but this is sort of usual for Robert Rodriguez movies and fits in with the rest of his movies and style. You can tell that they did their very best to make every sequences as gory as possible. It's however done in such an over-the-top and clearly intentional way that the gore becomes one of the humorous aspects of the movie. It's some very graphic stuff, so clearly this movie is not just for everyone.A totally awesome movie!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

How could Robert Rodriguez ruin a film that Tarantino nailed in the first half?,"From Dusk Till Dawn annoyed me in a variety of ways, particularly because the first half was so great and the latter totally destroyed the film. The first half felt like one of Tarantino's original stories, mixing many of the interactions found in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. I honestly loved it. Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney did a stellar job with their performances all throughout, and I thought they melded together extremely well. Along with that, the music, screenplay, and dialogue all meshed together very wonderfully in the first half.But, unfortunately, in one of the most disappointing decisions in the history of cinema, Robert Rodriguez decides to take part in the script once the plot takes place at the bar in Mexico. You know, the Titty Twisters? It was funny, to a certain extent. But then, vampires (who definitely look and act a lot like zombies) take over, and everything becomes goofy, ridiculous, and way over-the-top. Even if that was the point, it did not mesh well at all with the first half of the film at all, which many could argue would have made a great feature-length Tarantino feature. The vampires were so dumb and goofy, and although I laughed, I was cringing more than anything. I cringed at the fact that a perfect film was ultimately ruined. Why?",,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Wild and Fun Vampire Film,"Now this is an interesting film for me, because I recall watching this on the movie channels growing quite a bit. It always seemed to be on. The crazy thing though is I had no idea who Quentin Tarantino was until a bit after. There are also actors here that I would grow to realize who they are and their significance. This is now my second watch with a critical eye as I got to see this in the theater at the Gateway Film Center for a series they're doing with vampires over the winter.Synopsis: two criminals and their hostages unknowingly seek temporary refuge in a truck stop populated by vampires with chaotic results.We start this film with Pete Bottoms (John Hawkes) working at a liquor store in Texas. He has a chat with Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), who is a Ranger. They go back and forth until the subject turns to two criminals who are on the loose. Earl uses the bathroom and we see the guys they're talking about there. They're brothers Seth (George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Tarantino). They're upset with Pete and just want him to get rid of Earl so they can leave. Richard claims that Pete is tipping off Earl so a gunfight ensues. In the end it leaves Pete and Earl dead with the liquor store up in flames. Seth is irate with Richard as they flee.The two of them hold up in a cheap motel and we see that they have a hostage. She is told the rules of how to survive as Seth leaves to scope out their path to the border. The film then shifts to a family that is on vacation. Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) is a former priest who is having a crisis of faith after his wife passed away. With him are his daughter Kate (Juliette Lewis) and son Scott (Ernest Liu). This family ends up at the same motel.When Seth returns to the room, he finds that Richard has done something to their hostage. This angers him and they need a new plan to get over the border. This leads them to taking the Fuller family hostage. We see that Richard has mental issues as he thinks Kate makes a vulgar request.They make it across the border and end up at a bar called the Titty Twister. It has a rough crowd and at first Razor Charlie (Danny Trejo) won't serve them. Jacob diffuses the situation when he proves he has a trucker's license and they're allowed to stay. Their attention is drawn to Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek) entices everyone with a seductive dance. The night takes a turn when she and the others that work there reveal what they really are. This becomes a nightmare they'll never forget.As I kind of alluded to, I used to watch this one all the time and still enjoy it. It has such an interesting set up. If you had no idea what this film was about, you get a Tarantino crime film for the first part of it. Seth is in charge and is trying to get them across the border. On the other side you have the psychopath Richard who is sensitive if he is questioned. There is an even more interesting dynamic when you consider how Jacob interacts with Seth. He has the gull to call him out, but Seth sees he's right. That comes down to how you word it. It just this hardened criminal can be questioned by a former priest. Seth knows that Jacob is right in what he is saying so that helps to see logic.The film takes that dark tonal shift at the Titty Twister, which I also enjoy that aspect. I do have to say that the characters are way over the top, like Sex Machine (Tom Savini) who has a gun on his groin. He wouldn't be able to shoot it unless there's a mechanism that I'm not aware of, but that's the comedy of the film. I will be honest; it does hurt my rating a bit as it does bring down the realism. I do understand this is a vampire film, but everything else is grounded. There are other bits of comedy. When its dialogue, it works.The vampire part of the film I like as well. I do find it interesting that they are different looks to them. Santanico looks very similar to a snake when she turns, which is interesting as that is what she is dancing with. Others look quite monstrous and you get even more of that from the ones that show up later in the film as well, who are more like bats. It is almost like vampires from all over convene here at night to feed. There is a reveal at the end that explains things slightly and I absolutely love it.That brings me to the pacing, which I think is great. I never find myself bored here. There's a great way of introducing the characters that just feels natural and getting to know them. Even though you know the Gecko brothers are criminals, you worry about them getting over the border. We should be like Scott and want them to get caught, but there's a charisma that makes you question yourself. That is an interesting duality to the film. There is never a lull and I love the reveal at the end. I remember the first time seeing it and just thinking it was great.To move this next to the acting, which is great and carries this. I'm not sure if Clooney ever did horror movies before or after this, but he is so charismatic that I feel like he is Seth. There is something about him even when he is doing bad things that I had trouble hating him. Tarantino is also great as well. I love that we get a glimpse of what he thinks he's seeing and reveals he's crazy. I thought it worked well. Keitel is good, which is par for the course. Lewis was solid. Hayek was gorgeous and just had my jaw on the floor every time I saw her dance scene. It was fun to see cameos from Cheech Marin, Trejo, Savini, Fred Williamson, John Saxon, Kelly Preston, Greg Nicotero and Hawkes. The cast all turned in a great performance across the board.That moves me next to the effects. KNB were behind them, which when I saw that made since. I think the blood and gore in this film looks good. It is done practically so that makes sense. There is CGI that works in this as well. It was used when people change into vampires, which was fine. There are times it isn't so good. There are flames we see look fake and not all the looks of the vampires work for me either. I would say that overall, it is more positive than negative. I will say that cinematography is great. This is shot well to help build tension and set up these great set pieces like the RV and the bar. The last thing to cover is the music in the film. I'll give a shout out to the mariachi band that is playing, because even though it isn't my type of music, they do a good job fitting the bar. I do have to say it is a bit over the top cheese when they reveal themselves to be vampires and what they're using for instruments, but I digress.In conclusion, I still enjoy this film and it holds up. I love how we get a Tarantino/crime film to start out and it changes into a vampire film in the second half. It just moves so seamlessly. Not all the comedy works, but it doesn't ruin it. What carries here is the acting. That is great from our leads and the cameos. The effects are good. There is CGI that doesn't, but not enough to ruin this. The music fits what they needed as. With all that said I think this is a good film and would highly recommend it, even if you're not a horror fan. I will warn you that this gets bloody at times. This is a just a fun ride though.My Rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

One of the Greatest (Albeit Bizarre) Films of All Time,"Unlike most of the people who have commented on this movie, I saw it with no previous knowledge of the plot.  When it suddenly changed in mid-stream from a crime drama to a horror flick, I nearly had a heart attack.  I was absolutely not expecting any vampires to be showing up at this seedy Mexican bar.  George Clooney did a great job acting in this film, and the writing and directing were top notch.  The sound track was one of the best I have ever listened to in a movie, it fit perfectly well with the action on the screen.  Last, but not least, how can you not like Cheech Marin playing three separate and totally over the top roles?  This movie provided me with a great deal of pleasure, and that is all I ask of any film.  If you have not seen it, I highly recommend that you do so, preferably the DVD or Laser Disk Director's Cut.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
BEST FILM EVER,"GO AND SEE IT. From Dusk Till Dawn is the best film on the planet. It totally rules. There is a great cast and a cracker of a plot.

Relentless Action Horror Thrill Ride,"'From Dusk till Dawn' is one of the quintessential modern action horror movies of all-time, directed by Robert Rodriguez and written by Quentin Tarantino. Stylish, violent and vivacious it's a genre defining blast filled with over the top antics, cheesy yet awesome gore effects, engaging dialogue, and a splendid cast to create the ultimate horror action-comedy hybrid masterpiece for the ages.The Plot = Two criminal brothers named Seth (George Clooney) & Richard Gecko (Quentin Tarantino) are on the run from the Texas police and the FBI after a crime spree through the southwest. As they attempt to flee across the border into Mexico, they end up taking a family hostage lead by Pastor Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his kids Kate (Juliette Lewis) and Scott (Ernest Liu) and after successfully escaping they end up at a truck stop which is where the real trouble begins.The movie is a pure fun blast from start to finish as it starts off as an engaging violent action crime thriller filled with nerve racking tension, explosive set pieces, and plenty of entertainment before the genre change during the second act where it becomes a relentless vampire gore fest and it's a welcome and refreshing change of pace and a stroke of pure genius. The direction by Robert Rodriguez is top-notch as he brings plenty of style and a brilliant eye for the fast-paced action sequences, which mixes nicely with Tarantino's sharp writing and creates one of the finest cult classics of all-time.The cast is excellent and helps fill out this mad-cap world beautifully. George Clooney gives a strong performance as the cool and more level-headed brother, while Quentin Tarantino proves to be a pure blast as the unhinged and nerdy psychotic. Harvey Keitel gives a compelling performance as the preacher whose lost his faith. Juliette Lewis gives a fantastic performance as the wholesome Kate and Ernest Liu does okay as the younger brother. Salma Hayek, Fred Williamson, Tom Savini and Cheech Marin each provides memorable performances in their respective roles and adds a touch more brilliance to this already amazing film.Overall 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is a relentless action horror cinematic thrill ride masterpiece through and through.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Road movie meets the vampire genre.,"I've always been a sucker for road/killer/horror/vampire movies, so when a movie contains all four then I'm as happy as a pig in s*#t! Of course it's even better when the movies cast contains actors of the calibre of George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and the very sexy Salma Hayek in a delicious and highly sensual cameo appearance. The movie itself starts off as a road movie with Clooney and Tarantino as bank robber/killers who are on the run from the police. Things change for the pair after they enlist the aid of a preacher (Keitel) and his two children (including daughter Juliette Lewis) to get across the border to their rendezvous at the Titty Twister biker bar. What happens from that point is pure fun, and as long as your not the squeamish kind you should find the movie highly entertaining. Put simply the film isn't going to win an oscar, neither should it be taken seriously, but if your into this kind of movie then it is definitely one not to be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

How Gecko relates to Tarantino,"How Gecko relates to Tarantino. As soon as I found out Tarantino's father is an Italian, I began to learn Italian. Interesting that Gecko sounds as Tarantolino in Italian. Doesn't it remind you anything. I am not arguing anything, but just think of it. It would be the Tarantolino brothers.When it comes to movie, I would say it was perfect in the crime part. You could feel HIS (Tarantino) spirit in every detail, you could definitely know it was HIS Universe. Brilliant Michael Parks, absolutely great dialogs, attention to details - in other words everything was great. The question ""did poor boy mouth ""help me"" or not"" nearly killed me.But when the second, action part, began I was disappointed. HIS spirit was gone. I saw just stupid, boring and not in-HIS-style fighting film.Clarence said once there are film and there are movies. So, this is a film.",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Everybody Be Cool, You Be Cool","On the MTV Movie Awards, George Clooney won for Breakthrough Performance. Not only do I stand by this win, but because of From Dusk Till Dawn, Clooney has become my favorite actor.  It's true that in the middle, it is a bit slow, but the beginning scene (one of the best opening movie sequences I have seen on a movie) and the entire T*tty Twister scene (the main focus of the movie) are action packed.  Even when there is no action, with the help of the four actors (Clooney, Tarantino, Keitel, and Lewis), the film is still interesting.  Note:  This movie has extreme pervasive language and EXTREME gore (because it is a vampire movie).  You also cannot take the story seriously.  If you get passed the language, gore, and basic story, you should have a fun time with this movie.  Honestly, it is one of my favorite movies!!!!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Must watch this is guys!!,"10/10! 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is a cinematic masterpiece that seamlessly blends crime, horror, and dark humor to create a truly unforgettable viewing experience. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's collaboration is pure magic, with Tarantino's razor-sharp script and Rodriguez's bold, stylish direction combining to create a film that's both a loving homage to exploitation cinema and a bold, innovative work in its own right.The cast is phenomenal, with George Clooney and Harvey Keitel delivering standout performances as two brothers on the run from the law. Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu also shine in supporting roles, while Tarantino himself steals every scene he's in as the charismatic but unhinged Richie Gecko.But what really sets 'From Dusk Till Dawn' apart is its bold, genre-bending narrative, which shifts seamlessly from crime thriller to vampire horror movie in a way that's both surprising and completely logical. The film's second half is a masterclass in building tension and delivering jump-out-of-your-seat scares, with Rodriguez's direction and the film's impressive practical effects combining to create a truly unforgettable horror experience.Overall, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' is a must-see for fans of crime movies, horror movies, and just great storytelling in general. It's a bold, innovative, and endlessly entertaining film that will keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and watch it ASAP - and be prepared to sleep with the lights on afterwards.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

would you like a movie with your violence sir?,"Lets cut straight to the point. This is no masterclass in cinema, this is no thought provoking, intellectual study of human nature, or anything for that matter. Reality and subtlety go straight out the window for this flick. It starts as what looks like another ""bad robbers take hostages"" movie, but soon enough descends into a 'feast your eyes on this' gloriously OTT, bloodthirsty, semi-comic piece of gore porn.It tells the tale of bank-robbing brothers Seth (Clooney)and Richard (Tarantino) Gecko, who are on the run from the law after several murders. Soon enough they run into a small family travelling in an RV, the father Jacob (Keitel) daughter Kate (Lewis) and son Scott (Lui). The Gecko's use them and their RV as means to cross the boarder into Mexico, where the brother have a meeting with a drug baron arranged. The meet is to take place at a brightly lit, Gothic looking venue called the ""Titty Twister"" out in the desert. It is about now that the film starts to turn into another genre, the hostage plot steps back into the shadow as the bar's employee's turn out to be seriously, and I mean SERIOUSLY bad news.Does this mean it is bad? NO, I actually thought it was awesome upon first viewing and still do now. Its one of those totally uninhibited films you can sit back and enjoy without having to think too much. It is gripping from the start, seeing the Brothers run into various obstacles whilst evading capture, then later watching with baited breath as the remaining survivors trapped inside the Titty Twister contemplate their rather unfortunate situation.Clooney is especially good as wise cracking but highly dangerous Seth Gecko, its quite a change from his other roles. Also look out for horror maestro Tom Savini, 80's movie star Fred Williamson, Cheech Marin playing 3 separate roles and of course what film set in Mexico wouldn't be complete with out Danny Trejo.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Not Quite the Film to get worked up about,"This is a film that is talked about...especially by Robert Rodriguez fans. Unfortunately they would be the only ones who I think would love this film.The biggest problem I had with this film is the fact that it was poorly distributed and spanned out. The film's runtime is 1:43mins and the main plot concerning the vampires does not come in until and hour into it. I would suggest a longer time with the vampires and a little less with the two brothers (Clooney and Tarantino). The vampire 'segment' of the film went by way too quick. One minute they walk into the vampire-infested strip bar and the next they are fleeing from the bar with blood-stained, ripped clothes.But, the gore was necessary and somewhat...entertaining.

I lived the dialogue in the movie like all Tarrntino movies have. i especially liked the Gecko brothers dialogue(especially Seth) and the owner of the titty twisters when they first arrived at the bar.

I love this film,A friend of mine recommended this film to me a few years ago along with 6 or 7 others and as he is a film nut I thought I would give it a whirl. He didn't tell me anything about it so I just went for it. I have got to say I wasn't that impressed at first but as the film went on I started to 'tune in' so to speak. By the end I was really impressed and after a few more viewings I just loved it more each time. I it not a great classic but personally I never get bored watching this film. Some of you out there probably wont like it for all sorts of reasons and I suppose the purists will deride it but I like it and I would recommend anybody watch it all the way through at least once.

2 movies,"Like many have said, it is basically two movies. A half hour into it I was disappointed it had taken me so long to watch it. The opening 10 minutes are outstanding. It was like a time warp back to Dogs/Pulp, but with Clooney in the mix. Tarantino's acting was once again painful however - it's bearable in Dogs/Pulp because it's kept to a minimum. But I can't stand his voice, delivery and chin. Clooney was great, although after a while his ""lines"" became a bit much. It was starting to feel like a profane trailer instead of a movie. I don't know if the subtlety needed to come from Clooney toning it down a little, or Tarantino writing something less corny. This would have been a keeper for me if Tarantino replaced himself with someone from his regular group like Buscemi, then chose to direct, and sh#tcanned the whole vampire bit.

Since his departure from ER he seems to have gone from strength to strength, and sad muppet that I am I even liked him as Batman.The script is a bit predictable at times maybe but some of the one liners are great, and the interaction between the characters is well done, no-one particularly steals the show (apart from Hayek when she does that dance) and Tarantino and Clooney as the two convict brothers are really good.Brilliant film, that's different enough to make it interesting and as with any film that has Tarantino's influence it has a stonkin' soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

And its like two different movies! It takes them forever to get to the bar; and then it takes them forever to get out! I guess there are some props to the special effects team but that's it. And why is George Clooney in this? Hey George! Did you lose a bet? Tax lien on your Italian villa? Pets were being held hostage? I liked exactly 10 seconds of that movie.

"Vampires QT style, makes you wanna have it no other way","From Dusk Till Dawn is another QT event or treat. Half a Natural Born Killers film, the remaining half, a vampire one. And don't think for a second, either, cause it's a QT product, it doesn't work as a vampire film. You're sorely mistaken. In my opinion, it's actually better that a lot of other vampire films, in terms of gore, makeup, and in the ways the vampires are put to rest, and how the remaining score of players, deal with fending them off, amongst some great QT tongue and cheek dialogue, he must of had a ball, writing this. It has a great start too, in a convenience store, before it's turned upside down by the Gecko brothers, in a shootout, before it's torched. Clooney is cool, charismatic and deadly, while Quentin, the sex offending sicko, does a fine job, indeed. We really fear these guys at first, where in the second half, we're rooting for em' to kill off the vampirish evil. Keitel turns in a much different performance, as a preacher, who's lost his faith. He's impressively good. Him and he's two kids Juliette Lewis, good, and his adopted Asian son, Ernest Liu, of obvious amateur ilk, are kidnapped and are used by the Gecko's as their ticket across the border. The first half of the film is rather nasty, one scene especially involving QT who's raped and killed a 50's female hostage, while Clooney goes out and some Big Kahuna burgers. Clooney also has a talent and charm, to be comedic. He really has his moments. Then comes the next half, where they make a giant mistake indeed at their rendezvous point, The Titty Twister, a truckers and bikers bar, offering lap dancers by hotties, Mexican food, alcoholic beverages, also a rocking band, plus a deadly vampirish secret of course. The gore and fight scenes are choreographed second to none, you feel the helplessness amongst this bloody mayhem, which is full on at first, aided by ghoulish and loud music scores. Perfect. Tom Savini as Sex Machine always comes prepared, with his waist ammo, that comes in handy for snatching beers of other rough folk. And Williamson (the Hammer) even looks big as a vampire, and one ugly son of a bi..h to go with it. Cheech Marin shows us what character acting is too, in three roles in which is bloody good. In one role as the dj host, outside the twitty twister, he informs us of the large inventory of pu..y that the Titty Twister provides, before getting hammered by Clooney too. I didn't realize either how good Danny (Machete) Trejo (a real life prisoner at one stage) was as an actor, who plays a bartender who gets into a little bit of a feud with Clooney, over the particular clientele of the Titty Twister. What we get here folks is one hell of a ride, and we do not wanna get off. I liked too how the Geckos came together with the Fullers, as friends, at the TT, before hell is unleashed, where earlier, the family would of truly been killed, if crossing them. QT, is one smart and lucky son of a b..ch who gets to suck Salma Hayek's toes. She's hotter in this, then Desperado, and she really can act too. One scene that was in bad taste, but was guilty amusement, was earlier with Kelly Preston as a news reporter, is giving out the tally of victims killed, at the hands of the Gecko, but saying it with a vim and excitement. But let's not forget, this is from the pen of Tarantino. FDTD, a different, less Tarantino hit, cinematically, stands apart from his others, but definitely put this one on your QT bucket, if not viewed it. It's vitally imperative, you do.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
"Starts off like a Tarantino film, but becomes a Rodriguez movie","This was a very unique movie. Yes I say that a lot, but its true. Especially with From Dusk til Dawn. Tarantino and Rodriguez always make great films together, and this was no exception. The film starts off in a basic ""Tarantino Movie"" sense that is seen and felt in Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. However, it quickly becomes a Rodriguez film in the blink of an eye, and it has the ""Rodriguez Movie"" feel that his other films have. The actors which appear here are seen in many other Tarantino and Rodriguez movies. From Tarantino's films, we have: Harvey Keitel (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction), Michael Parks (Kill Bill, Death Proof), small parts such as Lawrence Bender (Producer in a lot of Tarantino films) even Tarantino himself. And from Rodriguez's movies we have: George Clooney (Spy Kids), Cheech Martin (Spy Kids, Planet Terror), Danny Trejo (Spy Kids, Planet Terror), even Tom Savini (automatically makes this movie awesome). This was a great combination of directing and story. The characters here were all very memorable and were given a great story to work with. Many will argue that this movie is very violent and gory, well, aside from Spy Kids, all of Rodriguez's films are violent, mindless, and very cold at times (see Planet Terror or Sin City if you want an example). Yet this movie was underrated for it. Only a 6.9 while Planet Terror got a 7.7 and Sin City got an 8.4 (all ratings as of 3/2/08). I guess people were expecting a Tarantino movie like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs and were unhappy when they saw what type of movie this was. I thought it was great. Harvey Keitel was very good. George Clooney was surprisingly the best actor here. Tarantino played a very good psycho also. Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu were also very good. My man Tom Savini was great as Sex Machine (I love the gun trick he uses). Fred Williamson was also good as Frost. Cheech Marin was good in all 3 parts he played, Danny Trejo and Salma Hayek were great. There were no bad performances as far as I could tell. This was a good movie and deserves the same respect as movies like Sin City, Reservoir Dogs, and all of those. 9/10 seems like a good rating for this movie but just isn't what everyone else agrees with. See this movie if you are a Rodriguez movie fan, you will enjoy it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Baffled,"This movie left me completely baffled. As said by others, it starts out as a sort of road movie and then turns into a horror(well sort of). Each of these genre's have something typical, but in this movie there is only one guiding principle: violence. There are other movies which are violent, like Cross of Iron, the Wild Bunch, Saving Private Ryan, Psycho or Letters from Iwo Jima. I liked these movies because each of these movies have something else to offer besides violence. Sure there is a weak effort to make some fun like in the living dead series. Sure a tongue in cheek effort is made to hint at the vampire genre. Sure there is the sexy dancing. But it lacks the fun, it lacks the twist and about the sex:after Selma Hayek has done her stimulating dance she is gone in a minute because what is left is violence: pure, undiluted, utter, gory, bloody, sexy violence. Therefore if you want to see a movie that is based on violence and violence alone: pick this one!",4.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Nice to see a decent film about vampires!,"With some credible and well thought out action scenes mixed with some gory vampire clichÃ©, Director Robert Rodriguez gives us one of his best productions yet, in which George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino pair up to play the ruthless Gecko brothers, criminals and gun slingers of the west.

Clooney's commanding charisma and Tarantino's eerie unpredictability make for a compelling duo.The film's shocking mid-point twist flips the narrative on its head, plunging the audience into a nightmarish world of vampires and carnage.

Fun vampire film with only minor flaws,"Trying to hide out from the authorities, a pair of bank-robbers and the family they've taken hostage find the Mexican strip club they're rendezvousing at is the home to a race of vicious vampires and try to fight their way out before they're taken over.This here is an exceptionally enjoyable and entertaining entry with a ton of positives going for it. The fact that there's an abundance of gore here certainly helps matters, due to this one's impressive portrayal of vampires in a rather imposing light as being far more interested in spilling blood and killing than in anything else, so the deaths they inflict as well as the retaliation to take them down are suitably gory and contain a ton of bloodshed. With two massive massacres in here, the main showdown in the bar-room where they reveal their true selves and just go crazy on the victims in the room as well as the last-stand where they're trying to fight the creatures off, contain a lot of big action, great deaths and lots of bloodshed. Also making them something to be feared is the fact that the special-effects make-up for them looks incredible, from the demonic look of most of them with the fangs and deformed appearance as well as the snake-like look of the main dancer makes for a great all-around look and makes their bloodlust all the more believable. It is also hard not to notice the featured striptease in here before the main massacre, it's about as sensual and erotic without crossing into sleaze as it's going to get and is definitely a highlight in its own right. The main problem here, though, is the beginning before they get to the joint, which consists of nothing but an endless stream of profanity and not much else, making the film appear as far removed from a horror film as possible and not really delivering anything remotely entertaining due to the personalities of the people we're supposed to be rooting for. Otherwise, this is a rather enjoyable vampire effort.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Extreme Graphic Violence, Nudity and children in jeopardy",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Starts off well and then gets better,"This film, if nothing else, deserves high marks if only for its complete tounge-in-cheek attitude to the whole Vampire scenario. The start of the film is fairly cool, with a good introduction to the two characters who will play a big part in our adventure, but then it kind of dies down until they reach the...ahem...nightclub.Then the action really gets going and the humour gets more and more dark. ""Sex-Machine""'s machine gun is an absolute show stealer and the attitude of the Preacher's young daughter, expertly played by Julliet Lewis, steals the show from Clooney. Clooney's whole attitude is just superb and I had heard reports of bad acting in the film, but I find that hard to believe. Tarantino gives a wonderful, if slightly disturbing, performance as Clooney's perverted brother and Harvey Keitel is good as the preacher.I just couldn't finish here without a word for first the special effects, which seem totally different to all other Vampire movies, and Salma Hayek, who's role is far to brief, unlike her costume!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

"A mindless, tasteless, dull gorefest","From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)It's meant to be a B-movie, cheap, sleazy entertainment with virtually no storyline aimed to provide 'cheap thrills'. Well I don't care; I thought this was a waste of time and I was neither entertained nor excited. Although I do like Tarantino's style and sometimes Robert Rodriguez, I cannot credit From Dusk Till Dawn with anything. If I was entertained I would have awarded the film a higher rating, but since it was both flat and stupid it gets a very low score.The first act of the film until the characters enter the bar in Mexico is just watchable: How come I liked the first part better? I thought it might lead to something mildly interesting and the quick hitting humour from the Tarantino script was relatively enjoyable.On another note, I have to say that Quentin Tarantino's performance in this film is beyond awful (or is it because this is suppose to be a bad film, so the actors were advised to act badly?!!!) and he fully deserved his Razzie Nomination for 'Worst Supporting Actor'.Uninteresting, tedious cinema.2/10",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

The fact that he has some incredibly cool lines to say helps too.The best way to go into this film is not knowing anything about what is going to happen, like I did the first time I watched it. Easy to do when I was an impressionable teenager in the late nineties; probably not so easy now that even the tagline on the IMDB page gives away the twist.Having said that the film is still more than worth watching.

A fun blood bath with great writing and delivery (just skip the ending)!,"Coming close to 25 years after its first release, I rewatched From Dusk Till Dawn, and it surprisingly holds up well. Although Clooney later goes on to win an Oscar for his dramatic roles, I think this is his best role. The Tarantino/ Rodriguez team is stellar at getting the most out of their actors, and understands cool moments. This film is no different, hoping from cool scene to cool scene with great performances all around.The Gecko brothers have escaped prison, and for the first 1/2 of the film we watch them flee from the law. Once they manage to escape to Mexico, well that is when the Vampires come in. There is not much to spoil in this film, as Clooney and Tarantino (in his biggest film role) go from scene to scene of carnage and cool. The usual Tarantino tropes are all here, and for the most part all hit.The special effects have not aged particularly well, but they aren't terrible either. And the 'CG' is laughable (I thought this the first time I saw it in the 90s too, and 20 years has not improved it at all).Now any film with Vampires can't be taken too seriously, however this Tarantino/Rodriguez film is the beginnings of their trend of having cool films devolve into silliness near the end. It does get ridiculous and dumb to a gowning fault by the end. My best advice is simply wait till there are 15 minutes left in the film and simply turn it off then. It's better that way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Pulp Fiction and Desperado with a little Blade,"Two dangerous convicts hold up a convenience store and end up executing a Texas Ranger and engaging in a bloody shootout with the clerk. After leaving, they take family hostage, a once-preacher father and his son and daughter. They make them a deal, stay with them until coming dawn and they will be released unharmed. They hole up for the night in a back-roads bar just over the Mexican border. Unknown to them though, they will soon be fighting for their lives against the bar's real owners, a group of vampires with a taste for blood and gore.This is a joint film between Quentin Tarentino, the creator of such classics as Pulp Fiction and later Kill Bill, and Robert Rodriguez, the creator of El Mariachi and later Sin City. With Rodriguez directing and Tarentino writing, producing and acting, this film is a force to be reckoned with. The script is classic Tarentino, with references to other cult classics, his own and others, and the dialogue is flawless in getting us close to the characters. The style of Desperado and El Mariachi is seen here too and shows why Rodriguez is one of the most coveted directors in Hollywood.The acting next to the crew is what really gets this film going. In the opening scene alone, a Texas Ranger played by Michael Park shows what real acting is in his short role of only a few minutes. George Clooney and Tarentino as the convicts play off each other well with Clooney being the quick-witted professional and Tarentino playing his younger brother with a psychopath hiding beneath the surface. Tarentino plays his role well, but Clooney shines as Seth Gecko with classic one-liners and acting ability. Harvey Keitel is great as the preacher father who lost his faith in God and Juliette Lewis as his daughter shows acting potential as well. Smaller roles by Fred Williamson and make-up artist Tom Savini do not go unnoticed either.This movie is almost two films in one as the opening half gets us into the characters and the second being a twist into horror as the characters fight for their lives against the vampires. People may find that one half suits them better than the other, but no matter what, Rodriguez, Tarentino and the actors take us for a ride that few will forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Is there a better actor than George Clooney?,"Okay, first of all let me just make this very clear.  I have never watched one single episode of ER in my life ( honest ).  So what I am about to say has nothing to do with some ridiculous love for the show.  Having said that, let me tell you that George Clooney makes this film the classic that it is. It is a great fi, because of Tarantino's writing and Rodriguez' style and it has a fun story and the other actors are really good in it.  But there is just something about Clooney that makes every scene that he's in believable. His interpretation of Seth Gecko is so amazing and so believable.  Take for instance the scene in the bar when he is teaching Kate how to slam a shooter.  He downs his own and then slams his glass down three times on the table.  It is tiny subtleties like this that make his interpretation of his character so real.  Every scene that he is in is a lesson in acting.  He can take any dialogue, whether it is bad or good and hit just the right note. Take for instance the film A Thin Red Line.  Now that was a really really really bad movie.  But when he was on screen for 30 seconds, it made me forget that it was a bad movie and I was  absorbed by what his character was saying.  Now that is power.Someday Clooney is going to win an Oscar and when he does people will look back at his career and say "" You  know what?  He was really good in that weird Tarantino film. ""  And I'll say I told you so.This film is a lot of fun and it has a lot of twists and turns and plus Tom Savini is in the film and that is worth seeing as well.

Then he turned the tables on movie-goers with the shower scene. Of course, the surprise is gone from Psycho because we all saw it.

Awesome!,"I can only say it in one word: Awesome! This is the absolute best vampire film I have ever seen and also the violentist.

George Clooney is cool in his role as a play-it-by-the-rules bank robber and Quentin Tarantino is totally wicked as his psychotic younger brother.  From Dusk Till Dawn is also in my opinion probably one of the more original vampire films out there.  The idea of vampires in Mexico is completely original.  Viewers be warned however, From Dusk Till Dawn is incredibly violent, there is a lot of cursing, and Cheech Marin makes a barrage of funny one-liners that all include a certain female body part.

Must-see for Tarantino fans,"I watched the film about a week ago and i think i have to post my comment now.I love this movie, it's one of my favorites. The film is split in 2 parts: first the movie shows how the gecko brothers try to get to Mexico, the second part is about the ""titty twister"" where they fight against vampires...the movie is exciting (especially the escaping), and its absolutely fun because of the Tarantino dialogue and cult scenes. if you want to watch an exciting and serious vampire film, watch another movie. i think Tarantino and Rodriguez made all that vampire stuff just for fun and to make something really weird, crazy and surprising (and they did it damn good,). some ppl say that they are disappointed because they suspected a good horror film. in my opinion it's not really a horror movie, the fun is the most important in from dusk till dawn.if you could REALLY laugh in pulp fiction or movies like sin city (not just grin, really LAUGH) this movie is perfect for you.i recommend it for every Tarantino/rodriguez fan. a really must-see.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

This Is One Crazy Movie,"Extremely violent, very bloody, often crude and at times humorous. That about sums this movie up - except that you'd have to add to the list that it's really quite bizarre as well. The first half or so - while violent and bloody - comes across as pretty straight. George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play bank robber brothers who are trying to escape from the United States into Mexico after pulling off a job. Much violence ensues, until the brothers finally take an entire family hostage (played by Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) and manage to get across the border into Mexico in the family's RV and then proceed with their hostages to an out of the way bar to meet up with their Mexican contact. This, of course, is where things turn truly weird.It turns out the everyone who works at the bar (the bartenders, the band, the strippers, etc.) are actually vampires - and quite bloodthirsty ones at that. What started as just a place to hang out until they meet up with their contact Carlos becomes an all night bloodbath as they do battle against these creatures and struggle to stay alive.The first half was actually pretty good, but for me the second half ruined it. This might have worked well as just the story of a couple of violent and perhaps insane bank robbers who try to escape from the law. The vampire thing (even though that's how the movie is sold) was completely overdone and to me at least became very tiresome after a while. How many times do we have to watch a vampire getting a stake through the heart or burned with holy water? Well, according to this movie, we have to watch it a lot! Although I usually like vampire themed movies this one was just too weird to really be of much appeal to me, although it might appeal to action-oriented teens.I will add a word about George Clooney. I generally don't care much for his movies. It's seemed to me that the bigger he's become in Hollywood the less passion he's putting into his work, most of which I would say is characterized by a total lack of energy or enthusiasm. This was different. I liked him in this role - perhaps because this was still while he was a TV star trying to become a movie star, he put more into it. Whatever it was, this may have been the best performance I've seen him give in a movie. Unfortunately, it had to happen in a movie I didn't care much for. (3/10)",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

George Clooney is very, very cool as his brother Seth Gecko, however it was predicted that he would survive and turn out being the good guy.This movies is in all honesty a brilliantly unique film with many great characters, e.g Sex Machine, a very sexy dance by Salma Hayek and some great vampire killing.

From Good to Awful,"You know, before this movie, I never thought that Quentin Tarantino could've been involved in anything bad. Well my friends, I have seen the devil, and its name is From Dusk Till Dawn.This movie follows the rest of Tarantino's catalog and centers around a couple of lowlife thugs. In this case, it's the Gecko brothers, Seth and Ritchie (George Clooney and Tarantino himself). They're on the run from the law and about to cross the border into Mexico and Freedom. Their ticket out is the Fuller family (Harvey Keitel, Ernest Liu, and Juliette Lewis) also heading into Mexico. The Gecko brothers take the family hostage and, after making it across the border, hang out at the designated meeting place: a topless bar.Now for the fun part. It turns out that the bar is a late-nite hangout for vampires. And guess who's on the menu tonight?Appalled yet? I am. It's not that I'm against the idea in the first place, but these are two different movies duct taped together by one dance sequence. Sorry guys, it just doesn't work.When watching this movie, I felt like I was driving in a car that, for no reason whatsoever, suddenly jumped into a higher gear and took off at full speed. The first hour of the movie was more than watchable; it was pretty damn good. I loved the characters of the Gecko brothers and I thought that the movie would be about the conflict between the calm, calculating Seth and the unpredictable Ritchie, who will shoot or rape whomever he pleases. In fact, when he first sees Juliette Lewis' character, he imagines her asking him for oral sex. Ritchie, in my mind, was the time bomb of the movie, waiting to go off and throw the plot into a tailspin. Whoo boy, was I wrong.The second hour of the movie is the schlockiest of horror films you've ever seen. After seeing Robert Rodriguez' ""Sin City"", I knew that he had a taste for on screen violence. Well, this movie is more of the same. The vampires of the movie are the best that 1996 special effects could produce. That doesn't really say much, but man, are they gory. People's arms are ripped off their bodies, heads are hollowed out by shotguns, and one vampire is vanquished by having his heart ripped from his body and staked by a toothpick. Fun wow, huh?The first half of the movie had Tarantino's trademark element of humor. For instance, the first time we see Seth and Ritchie, they are trying to get out of a liquor store that a cop has just entered. Once the cop leaves to relieve himself, Seth and Ritchie, guns drawn, start having a discussion about whether or not the clerk tipped the cop off. It's hilariously funny and timed to perfection. Those first scenes should set the tone for the rest of the movie. And as I've probably spent too much time belaboring, halfway through, the film takes a sharp left turn. Over a bridge. Down a ravine. And into a tar pit.I wouldn't be so livid if the second half of the movie was well done. The vampire sequences in From Dusk Till Dawn have all been done before in other vampire movies, and frankly, the new parts just don't make any sense. While watching the film, I counted the following elements that caused my jaw to hit the floor, only to be reeled back up and let go again: 1. A cross composed of a shotgun and a baseball bat. 2. A hydraulic stake 3. A Holy Water Super Soaker (Can you say ""Bordello of Blood""?) 4. Characters having personal moments while being devoured hoagie-style by vampires. 5. A mariachi band that, at the moment of truth, morphs into a band of mutants with bloody corpses for instruments. 6. Lines like ""Okay Vampire Killers, let's kill some f***ing vampires!"" 7. Multiple appearances by Cheech Marin.See what I mean? What isn't tired is plain ridiculous. And there are more examples of absurdity in this movie. You could find them yourself, but don't say I didn't warn you.Harvey Keitel, who's had a history with Tarantino, plays Jacob Fuller, a priest who lost his faith in God when his wife died. There's nothing necessarily wrong with this character or how he's portrayed, but tell me this, why is it that whenever there is a story concerning evil or Satanic creatures, the local priest chooses to question his faith then? Juliette Lewis plays his daughter. Honestly, I wish I could've gotten to know her better. Lewis is a very talented and beautiful actress, but I guess when you're stuck with a part that is basically a young girl reacting to the situation around her, it's like putting a ballet dancer in a full-body cast. The only defining personality trait about her is that she gets really good with a crossbow when the going gets tough. I mean, really, she's like the Teenage Terminator! (Not a bad idea.) And I can't really call it a ""defining"" personality trait because everyone gets it at the same time in this movie.""From Dusk Till Dawn"" just plain does not work. Tarantino and Rodriguez are very talented filmmakers, and they've proved that time and time again, but they have given both their resumes a black eye with this mutated hybrid of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Assault on Precinct 13."" If you value the works of either person, avoid this movie like the vampires it portrays.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Great fun and excitement!,"Okay, where do I start? Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, two amazingly creative film makers, both had a hand in this film which made me have to see it. Now I went into the film with high expectations and was not disappointed at all. It was not necessarily what I expected but it turned out to be a non-stop, action packed ride. Great cast, good acting, good writing and an excellent filmmaker (Robert Rodriguez). I couldn't think of another director who could make a film such as this one and make it actually work out the way it did. Of course there is pretty graphic violence in it but most people would expect this if you've seen any of Rodriguez's other movies. Overall I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a rush of action-packed cinema. 10/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
It's going to be one night to remember.,"Directors Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino have different styles of making pictures for audiences, where they would have different taste in violence and culture in their movies; now they work together with a different project: Vampires! Though Robert Rodriguez brings in the Latin spice and Quentin Tarantino brings in the pop culture with the black and white gangster suits, it's a wild ride.The synopsis of ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" deals with the murderous Gecko Brothers, Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino) who are on a running spree from the authority. Seth is the play-it-cool and older brother while Richie has his own psychopathic thoughts; and in the film's prologue, Richie shoots a deputy for no reason, but assumes that the clerk ratted them out.As they are on the run, The Gecko Brothers have a female bank teller hostage in the back of their trunk and later while Seth is gone, Richie rapes her and makes up an excuse for why he killed her.After Richie screws up the plan, knowing that they might get caught, Seth decides to take action and force a minister named Jacob (Harvey Keitel) and his children Kate and Scott (Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) to take them to Mexico, or else they'll be executed one by one.Jacob takes his RV with the kids and the Gecko Brothers where they make it across the border and go to a strip bar where Seth and Richie have to meet some associates. In the strip bar, bikers and truckers punch each other while strippers dance around them.Everything turns to hell after a lap dance in which the battle begins when all the strippers turn into vampires killing a supporting character and the rest of the bikers and truckers as the survivors try to make it to the night without getting killed.""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is like the ""Evil Dead"" series where it is fun from beginning to finish with George Clooney in his first breakout role and the collaboration of Rodriguez and Tarantino makes this film a funhouse.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Entertaining action extravaganza with plenty of humor and gore.,"Seth Gecko (Oscar-Winner:George Clooney) and Richard Gecko (Oscar-Winner:Quentin Tarantino) are vicious low-lifes criminals on the run. Seth is a professional bank thief, who kills if he has to but his brother Richard is much more worse... he also rapes woman for pleasure. The Gecko Brothers are hoping to cross the Mexican boarder somehow but they decided to kidnapped three middle-class people by the name of the Fuller Family (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu) on their RV. The Gecko Brothers are supposed to meet their contact at a seedy bar in Mexico in the middle of nowhere titled ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". The Gecko Brothers and The Fuller Family, they kidnapped... they are amazed what kind of bar it is. But those dancers, the bartender (Danny Trejo), the band or the sexy owner of the bar by the name of Santanico Pandemonium (Salma Hayek) are not what they seemed to be... they are actually Vampires. They prey on Truckers and Bikers to feed or to turn others into Vampires. While Seth lost his brothers, while nearly everyone in the bar turned into vampires. Now Seth, The Fuller Family and two other survivors (Fred Williamson & Tom Savini) stay together to fight these creatures till dawn for survival.Directed by Robert Rodriguez (The El Mariachi Trilogy, Spy Kids Trilogy, The Faculty) made an entertaining cheesy Horror/Action film with plenty of amusing moments and over the top gore. Director Rodriguez and Screenwriter:Tarantino (Kill Bill Vol.1 & Vol.2, Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs) certainly have fun with their casting choices. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is one of those movies, where the cast & crew truly seems to be having one hell of a time making this drive-in style movie. Tarantino certainly has an ear for terrific dialogue, especially during the first half of the movie. Which it is totally different from the second half. Although a minor box office disappointment and the critics give this mixed reviews... ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" went on to be a Cult Classic on Video.DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. Disc one has an enjoyable commentary track by Rodriguez and Tarantino, two featurettes (One of them has Commentary with Rodriguez and Make-Up Effects Artists:Greg Nictero) and more. Disc two has an very entertaining documentary titled ""Full Till Boogie"", an fun behind the scenes look with the cast & crew.The Alliance Blu-ray has an sharp anamorphic (1.78:1) transfer and an terrific DTS 5.1 HD Sound. But sadly, the disc has no special features. ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" went on to produced two prequels with Rodriguez, Tarantino and Lawrence Bender involved as Executive Producers. But nothing tops the original... it is certainly one of the most remembered Cult Classic films of the 1990's. Don't miss it. Some familiar faces like Cheech Marin, John Saxon, Kelly Preston and more appears in bit parts. Although Marin plays three different characters in the movie.

Two mediocre films for the price of one.,"The Story: Seth & Richard Gecko, two violent criminals on the run from the law, kidnap an ex-minister & his children in order to escape into Mexico. While waiting for a contact at the Titty Twister, a dusk-till-dawn bar for truckers & bikers, they are attacked by an army of vampires & must fight till dawn to survive.It's not often you get to see two different directors (& good friends) combine their talents to make a genre film such as this. Working from an old script that Tarantino wrote when he was still a video store clerk, Rodriguez creates two different films for the price of one. The first 40 minutes consist of a fairly average getaway film. But instead of being hip, there is no wit in the dialogue, the acting is mediocre & the characterizations one-dimensional. Plus George Clooney's character tries to be likable but fails. Things get worse when the film changes once the characters reach the Titty Twister. The gore flies think & fast, along with credibility Â the characters learn how to kill vampires in next to no time, yet later have a discussion on how to kill them. Fred Williamson's speech on how he decimated a Viet Cong squad is purely unnecessary. Tom Savini's biker Sex Machine wields a genital-shaped gun, one of the most stupid weapons ever designed & later turns into a huge rat for no reason at all.

Gruesomely entertaining dark splatterhouse comedy,"From Dusk Till DawnIt is exceedingly difficult to categorize such a film as ""From Dusk Till Dawn"". Indeed, this may be a founded difficulty, as the film seems almost like two very different films each half completed, then mashed together in the middle. At first, the film seems like a standard Tarantino film, with his standard eclectic sense of dialogue and penchant for heavy violence and frequent profanity, following the story of the Geckos, two fugitive outlaw brothers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) on the run from the cops, trying to make it over the Mexican border with their family of hostages. (Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and Ernest Liu)However, when they reach the seedy Mexican bar arranged as a safe-house for the Gecko brothers however, the film takes an abrupt face. That's when the Rodriguez influence takes over, and the film suddenly turns into a splatterhouse intentionally bad for the sake of being entertaining monster flick, as it is revealed that the bar's workers are none other than... get ready for this... vampires. If it sounds stupid and incredulous... well, it is, there's no doubt about it, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the most ridiculously enjoyable splatterfest black comedies around.It's an odd little combination without a doubt, but for whatever reason, the bizarre mash of Tarantino's stylish wordplay and Rodriguez's later gore-fest seems to click, and the film comes together in a surprisingly entertaining fashion. It's nice to recall in this day and age of gravitas in monster movies that it is possible to make a monster flick only for the sake of being macabre and entertaining. The vampire effects are rather terribly done, but this is probably an intentional aspect, as it fits the oddly comedic tone of the picture perfectly. Only in a movie such as this could a director get away with giving a long monologue about Vietnam before being viciously bitten by a vampire, or a guitarist playing an instrument made out of human body parts. Such instances of coal black humour make up the most memorable parts of the film.Rodriguez also manages to draw impressive performances out of his cast, especially in the case of George Clooney, playing strongly against type in one of his first film roles as Seth Gecko, the tough as nails outlaw who is forced to become a sort of antihero to survive the vampire attack. Harvey Keitel also gives a powerful performance as the father of the kidnapped family, an ex-pastor forced to re-confront matters of faith. Keitel brings a sense of class and dignity to what is without a doubt one of the silliest films he has ever taken part in.Although Quentin Tarantino has received a lot of flack for writing himself into the script, he actually gives a fine performance as Richard Gecko, Clooney's paranoid and homicidal brother. Tarantino serves as the comic relief for most of the film's first half, especially in his first scene. Juliette Lewis gives a decent performance as Keitel's daughter who is also taken hostage, but Ernest Liu as the final kid in the family gives a rather lacklustre and unbelievable performance, almost (but not quite) ruining the superb scenes when Clooney talks to his hostages while riding their stolen RV. Salma Hayek also makes a sumptuous addition to the film, performing her snake dance, one of the most memorable stripteases in film history... without even removing any clothes!For those with low thresholds for gore or swearing, or those seeking out a more realistic and enlightening film, it is doubtful From Dusk Till Dawn will prove to your tastes. But for those willing to leave reality at the door and just enjoy a ridiculous yet absurdly entertaining vampire romp complete with intentionally inferior special effects and enough blood and gore to satisfy even the most bloodthirsty viewers, fraught with comedy as black as the night, this is the film for you.-8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Solid Entertainment,"My Rating: *** out of ****.Not every film that has Quentin Tarantino's name on it is a masterpiece but each film he's been somehow involved in is at least of good quality(I'm not counting Natural Born Killers since he disowned the film). From Dusk Till Dawn is not an exception. For this film, Tarantino wrote the script but instead his good friend, Robert Rodriguez is in the directors chair. While this collaboration is not without weaknesses, these two talented filmmakers turn out solid entertainment.From Dusk Till Dawn is actually not a story of Tarantino's. On the set of Reservoir Dogs, the make up artist for the film, Robert Kurtzman, told Tarantino that he would work for free if he turned a story(about vampires) he wrote into a film. So four years after Reservoir Dogs, From Dusk Till Dawn arrived in theaters.Even though this is not Tarantino's story he puts his stamp on it (even if that means having a sizeable role in the film). The first half of the film is more dialogue than action. The dialogue that Tarantino penned for this film is not quite up to what he wrote for Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown but there's still some snap to it. The second half although more concentrated on action, still has some good lines (""Psychos do not explode when sun hits them. I don't care how crazy they are."").The second half of the film is when director Robert Rodriguez gets to shine. Rodriguez has always had a talent for shooting action and that shows here. The over the top action is shot with flair and flawlessly edited (Rodriguez also handled the editing). Rodriguez never allows a dull moment in the entire movie.If theres a major flaw in the film its that I found the film too gross. I know it is supposed to be that gross by intention but it was just a little too much for me. There's nothing wrong with the make-up work though, which is excellent.This is not an actors film, but the performances work here. George Clooney is excellent here. He's given the best lines from Tarantino's script and deliver's them flawlessly. Tarantino himself is acceptable in his role. Effective work is provided by the rest of the cast.From Dusk Till Dawn will probably not appeal to everybody. If you dislike gory films than you should probably avoid From Dusk Till Dawn. I enjoyed it as a bloody, stylish and not too serious piece of entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
A good beginning cannot save your movie.,"The opening of this thriller/horror movie is, as we are use to from Tarantino, spectacular.

I first saw this on TV and excitedly watched a cheer-for-the-bad-guy heist movie. BUT, 30 min it turns itself around. Completely. It becomes campy, and silly, and the giant shout out.

One Word: Awesome,"The man who brought us Desperado, The Faculty, and El Mariachi brings an action/horror film like no other.

They take the family hostage and head down to a bar where the Geckos will met a friend who has all the things they need. But upon entering the bar and having a few drinks they realize they're in deeper than ever thought. This is the film that brought George Clooney to the superstar status. He's cool, violent, and one person that should not to be messed with. You're in awe of him the entire film. Quentin is goofy, quiet, and sick. He's perfect as Clooney's annoying little brother. Keitel doesn't do too much and it works. He's a father that truly cares about his kids and will do anything for them. Lewis is sassy, funny, cute and can kick butt. She should do more action films. The girl has star power. This film is up there with Dead Alive and Starship Troopers as one of the bloodiest films of all time. There is extreme violence, lots of gore, and tanker trucks full of blood. Robert Rodriguez out does himself with this one.

"Foul-mouthed,, gory, brutal, funny, and extremely unpredictable","From Dusk Till Dawn is Rodriguez' best directing feat to-date and I cannot even believe how awesome it is. It stars the very elite of badass cinema--George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis. The two former play brothers and partners in crime on their way to Mexico for a big business rendez-vous and on their way they take a family of three hostage in order to get a ride there. You may think you have the good taste not to enjoy something as silly as its premise, but as far as horror films go, this is quality. Harcore quality.I will tell you what makes From Dusk Till Dawn awesome and what sets it apart from other films. The first half of the movie looks like it's taking the form of a hostage drama and you're left thinking that it will probably culminate in a couple of murders once the brothers reach their destination in Mexico. This part is very nicely handled as it builds up tension in the plot and at the same time has this barren Western feeling as the vehicle swooshes through the desert. The dialogue is very Tarantinoesque (he wrote it, after all). Then, as they reach their rendez-vous point they enter a titty bar somewhere in Mexico. Only, this isn't your average shady strip-club but it is stock-full of vampires at night. God, this part is so random. So what starts off as a hostage drama suddenly turns into a full-on war against vampires, with the family and brothers left fending for themselves against these awful creatures all night long.From Dusk Till Dawn is foul-mouthed, gory, brutal, funny and extremely unpredictable. It also contains one of the most haunting final shots ever in a movie. I highly recommend it. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

A fantastically paced combination of crime thriller and horror, Rodriguez crafts a ridiculously fun and darkly sleazy tale while including riotously great action and gruesome gore. The performances are great; definately Tarantino's best role as the creepy and psychopathic Richard, sibling of Gordon who is similarly a career best from George Clooney. Gordon is threatening and unstable but also has an irresistible charm that makes the audience and family he kidnaps feel oddly comfortable around him. There are awesome cameos from Rodriguez's favourites Danny Trejo, Cheech Marin (in awfully but hilariously perverted form) and Salma Hayek; particular standout from Hayek in probably one of the sexiest and most badass dance sequences ever captured on film! The script by Tarantino is naturally witty, sharp and effortlessly cool. Rodriguez injects his trademark styles throughout including fantastically choreographed action and music sections, the best kind of cheesy dialogue deliveries and just the coolest of swaggering flair.

It's so crazy that the random genre-hop halfway through was almost to be expected of something like this.

The ultimate in crime-splatter-vampire-road-movies,"An unusual mix of crime-thriller and splatter horror, From Dusk Till Dawn is, if nothing else, a very entertaining film. It's unashamedly trashy with no pretence otherwise. But it's good quality trash none-the-less. The first half of the story sees a couple of evil brothers on the run from the law, while terrorizing anyone they meet on the way. They take a family hostage and cross the border into Mexico in their camper-van. When they arrive at their destination, unexpected things start to happen.For me, the crime-thriller part of the story is the most effective. It's tense and unsettling. George Clooney is very good as the chief brother, while Tarantino is OK as his unhinged sibling. In any case, their road trip from hell is compelling and really sets the film in motion. Once they arrive at their destination the film more or less starts over again, with all that went before effectively irrelevant as the movie turns into a vampire splatter flick. From Dusk Till Dawn truly is an example of two completely different film ideas joined together somewhat loosely. But it doesn't really matter as the result is definitely different, and it never takes itself very seriously. Watch out too for a very nice final shot that gives a whole new perspective to the 'bar' where all the undead action has taken place.

Robert Rodriguez shoots it fine, although you can feel in the quiet moments, the 'quasi lulls', that it was not really his movie.What's very good in From Dusk Till Dawn is the dialog. Tarantino is definitely a master movie speech writer. He may steal from the ton of movies he has digested, he, the mad movie-hungry monster, he does it really fine, as a real connoisseur, not as a low-life grave-digger.What's really bad in the movie? The sick violence meant to be entertaining. Rich Gecko is a sicko and Tarantino thinks he is being funny. It's horrendous to depict such a degree of realistic violence tongue in cheek. Seth Gecko is supposed to be cleaner, while no smarter, yet that doesn't even it out. If that's the way it was intended then Seth Gecko is a bad excuse for his brother's excesses. The part in the desert where the body count goes way up is much more gore than the exposition with the Gecko bros but it's only cheap teenage stuff. You may feel it's dull as I do, or enjoy it because you like cheap; the fact is: sick realistic violence in the beginning is not washed out by the funky carnage that makes the bulk of the movie.Ironically enough, the disturbing start was more interesting than the contrived party in the Mexican desert. The last shot was great though.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Fantastic,"I wanted to respond to the current top review, ""True Tarantino."" First of all, to call it ""true Tarantino"" and never mention Rodriquez is either misleading or ill-informed. Tarantino wrote the script and played one of the lead characters, yes, but he did not direct the film. He actually denied various subsequent levels of involvement with the film in order to concentrate on his portrayal of Richard Gecko after completing the script. I believe Rodriquez deserves as much credit here as Tarantino, and after the second half of the film, KNB Effects deserves as much as either of them.That said, to say that the effects weren't ""very good"" is just silly. While the effects can often be campy and over the top to the point of being unrealistic, it's a monster film, and it treats the effects as such. These aren't your everyday ""actor with false teeth"" vampires, these are Evil Dead II style demons, creatures that resemble less Lugosi and more The Thing, mutated, weird, and disturbing, and more concerned with entertainment than realism. You must also consider that some of these effects were highly functional, not just simple makeup jobs but interactive builds that sprayed fluid, changed shapes, and moved about. You must also consider that this is a 15+ year old film. If you're looking for visual effects that blend practical makeups with CG elements in every shot, or worse, nothing but CG for ""effects,"" then you're looking for the wrong thing here. Aside from a few blends, melts, and effect fades, everything you see was done in front of the camera, in person, for real, and it looks that was. None of the effects look like something you couldn't reach out and touch, and they all live up to some of the best and highest regarded horror and scifi effects created for film. I'd love to see what the OP thought was a ""good"" special effect.All of this aside, this is a fantastic film. The first has is engaging, interesting, and unique, tugging you along for the ride in a familiar fashion to other Tarantino scripts in a decidedly Tex-Mex Rodriquez style. It slows down only to let you get involved with the characters, and is at no point boring or dismissible. If you take someone who has never seen this film, and doesn't know what it's about, and sit them down to watch it, the range of expressions and reactions you'll get to the mid-movie vampire shock are worth repeat viewings with a new audience. After the shift in story arc, the following scenes are fun, entertaining as hell, and right up the gore/camp/gun alley of anyone who enjoys the Evil Dead series (for whom KNB also did the effects). I can't imagine a more consistently entertaining film in this genre. It's one of my all-time favorites and it's always fun to see again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

A little messy but so cool it doesn't matter.,"Definitely paving the road that Tarantino should have gone down, ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" is one of my all time favorite movies. Amazingly badass opening scene. From there, the way the script flows is amazing; all the characters mesh well. Keitel, Liu and Lewis play a family kidnapped by Tarantino and Clooney (yes George Clooney) in a fantastic duo: the Gecko brothers, two criminals on the run to El Rey, Mexico. They rendezvous at an open-all-night nudie bar and it turns out to be a haven for vampires. Despite the fact that they are technically vamps, I still classify ""From Dusk Til Dawn"" as a zombie film. It's gory, it's violent it's funny and it's grimy.I can't believe George Clooney is so cool in this. Why he didn't make more films like this, one can only guess. He makes a great low-life, intelligent criminal. Also, I wish Richard was a bit more likable. Why Tarantino made that character such a sicko is beyond me.All in all an awesome horror flick that seems to never get old. I wish Quentin and Robert still made em like this! 8 out of 10, kids.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
You will want those moments of your life back.,"This movie has been more highly rated by others because it has big names and some novelties in it. If lesser known actors had played in it, it would be given the rating it deserves.It would only be fair to give credit where it is due, so I will agree that at times the movie employs some interesting dialogue. At times, the actors deliver that dialogue quite well.Ultimately, though, a movie is about story. Writing a great character or an interesting dialogue exchange and plopping them in the middle of a terrible story does not salvage the terrible story. Adding novelties (like Sex Machine's special wardrobe feature) doesn't either.This is a great example of how twists in a story can sometimes harm rather than enhance it. The twist in this movie is forced and silly. This pushes a mediocre story into the realm of awful.In this case, the whole of this movie is less than the sum of its parts. It is absolutely wretched.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
I bet you did not expect the film to change from hostage situation to vampires.,"Great Great Great Great. Thats what I can say for this film because it really shocked me when I was saw this. Back when I was 9 I saw this and I loved it so much. It was graphic because I could remember Starz not playing it until 10:00 pm because of its violence and language. Now i can officially tell you, that Starz was right not to play the movie until 10:00. I though enjoyed the hell out of this one and will never forget it. The film went from hostage situation to vampire vs human in a matter of 15 minutes. I was expecting the movie to end like in a police chase or something, not vampires killing everyone in sight.

"One Of The Greatest Vampire Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Thrilling,Over The Top Action-Horror-Thriller Cult Classic From Robert Rodriguez And Quentin Tarantino.","From Dusk Till Dawn is one of the greatest vampire films ever made,an excellent and over the top Action-Horror-Thriller that combines terrific direction,a fantastic cast,a great script,a memorable score and soundtrack and outstanding special effects. All of those elements make From Dusk Till Dawn a Cult Classic that is Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino at their best.From Dusk Till Dawn tells the story of criminals and brothers Seth(George Clooney)and Richie Gecko(Quentin Tarantino)who are on the run from the cops and have to get across the border to Mexico with their hostages Jacob Fuller(Harvey Keitel)and his kids Kate(Juliette Lewis)and Scott(Ernest Liu). When the Geckos and the Fullers arrive in Mexico they go into a bar called the Titty Twister which is filled with bloodsucking Vampires. Now,The Geckos and Fullers have to fight the Vampires and stay alive.From Dusk Till Dawn is a brilliant and memorable Action-Horror-Thriller that was a collaboration between film directors and best friends Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino(who wrote the screenplay). Together Rodriguez and Tarantino combined their respective talents and crafted one of the best Vampire films of all-time and is a film that spawned a Television show and two Direct-to-DVD sequels and is a Cult Classic from the moment you watch it. From Dusk Till Dawn is a terrific and truly unforgettable genre film that is like a gigantic fireball that hits you in the face right from the start and has an intensity that never stops until the very end. From Dusk Till Dawn is a film that embraces it's B-movie roots giving the audience a bloody,gory and over the top Vampire movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and basically tells the viewers to have a good time giving viewers a Grindhouse movie that throws in everything but the kitchen sink giving us a Horror movie,Action film,Crime Drama and Western all in one with a dark Comedic style. One of the things that I have always enjoyed about FDTD and one of the reasons it stands out from other Vampire flicks is the way the movie is structured. The first half of the film is more like a Crime Drama focusing on the Geckos and the Fullers and the efforts to try to get to Mexico with mostly dialog getting viewers to know the main characters who are interesting and have depth. It's very much like a Quentin Tarantino film. The second half of the film is just pure Action-Horror and is very much like a Robert Rodriguez film because it is filled with Vampires,blood,guts and carnage all around with tons of excitement and chaos. The dialog and character driven style of Tarantino and the wild over the top Action of Rodriguez go together well with nothing feeling uneven or mismatched. And Speaking of dialog,the screenplay by Quentin Tarantino is wonderful with memorable dialog that is well-written and interesting. And while the dialog in FDTD isn't iconic or fresh like Tarantino's other efforts it's still a great screenplay with terrific lines. The Vampires in FDTD are ugly,vicious and brutal and are not the kind of Vampires you want to be friends with because when they attack a human the Vampires tear a person to shreds. These Vampires in FDTD are not the romantic type but are ugly and disgusting creatures who at the drop of a hat(or in this case a drop of human blood)will kill anyone with a heartbeat and suck the blood out you. The blood and gore in FDTD disgusting and comes out like water and truly feels like a Splatter movie. The Action is explosive,fiery and fast and will have viewers on the edge of their seat because the Action comes you never know what's going to happen or when. The Action scenes in FDTD are Robert Rodriguez at the top of his game. The ending of From Dusk Till Dawn is amazing and filled with tons of Action and gore that is filled with tons of chaos and mayhem that perfectly goes with the rest of the film. A terrific and memorable conclusion.The cast is wonderful. George Clooney is excellent and at his best as Seth Gecko,with Clooney being charismatic and cool. Harvey Kietel is terrific as Jacob Fuller,a preacher. Quentin Tarantino is outrageous and memorable as Richie Gecko,Seth's mentally unstable brother. Juliette Lewis is fantastic as Kate Fuller,Jacob's daughter. Ernest Liu does a good job as Scott,Jacob's son. Salma Hayek is outstanding and sexy as Santacio Pandemonium,an exotic dancer. Cheech Marin is incredible in his trio of roles(Border Guard,Chet Pussy,Carlos). Tom Savini(Sex Machine)and Fred Williamson(Frost)do great jobs as guys that the help the Geckos and Fullers against the Vampires. Danny Trejo(Razor Charlie),Michael Parks(Texas Ranger Earl McGraw),John Hawkes(Pete Bottoms,Liquor Store Clerk),John Saxon(FBI Agent Stanley Chase),Marc Lawrence(Old Timer Motel Owner),Kelly Preston(Newscastor Kelly Houge)and Brenda Hillhouse(Hostage Gloria Hillhouse)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Rodriquez is terrific with Rodriguez always moving the camera and giving the movie a stylish look with zooms,close-up as well as high and low angles while doing a great job with the Action scenes. Wonderful job,Rodriguez.The score by Greame Revell is great,intense and fits with the tone of the movie. Fine score,Revell. There is also a great soundtrack with songs by The Blasters(Dark Night),ZZ Top and Tito And Tarantula. Cool soundtrack.The Special Make-Up and Practical Effects by the always great K.N.B EFX Group is amazing as always with make-up effects that add to the film. Terrific job once again,K.N.B.In final word,if you love Robert Rodriguez,Quentin Tarantino,Vampire movies,Horror Films or Action movies,I highly suggest you see From Dusk Till Dawn,one of the greatest Vampire movies ever made and an excellent Action-Horror-Thriller Cult Classic that you can watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

The first half makes you think it's a real movie...,"And then Cheech shows up and all the great rising action just comes to a halt. Cheech is effortlessly hilarious from what I remember, but you'll notice he doesn't fit at all. The rest of the movie takes a quick turn to stupidville immediately after that. It's not done in a funny or entertaining way either. It's just lame.For the sake of laziness I save the basic synopsis to the other reviews, but I want to point out that this movie actually had quite a lot of real potential in the beginning. Keitel's character and his loss of faith, his love for his kids, etc. could've played against Clooney and Tarantino's bond and it would've been compelling despite Tarantino's inability to act.Unless it's entertaining for you to watch a movie get sabotaged half-way through you should avoid this one. If only the first half had been so terrible--there was actually a touch of substance for once in one of Quentin's movies, I should've known it wouldn't last--I would've turned it off then and not wasted my time.The ""4"" rating is mostly due to Cheech Marin's 30 second onslaught of hilarity and the acting chops of all but Quentin in the beginning.

Forget Death Proof - THIS is how the other half of Grindhouse should've looked,"Written by Tarantino back in his video shop employee days, and directed by Robert Rodriguez fresh off his Desperado breakout, From Dusk Till Dawn is really two episodes combined to make a fun, funny and original, yet totally off-the-wall film.It also had an in-her-prime Salma Hayek dancing in a bikini with an albino snake wrapped around her neck - never a bad thing.Ever.The opening scene has Earl and Pete yakking up a storm in the local bottle-O. Among other things they discuss a local string of crimes perpetrated by two low life brothers named Seth and Richie Gecko, that include robbery, murder and kidnapping. It seems they are headed for the border which will mean they go right through the local area. Earl hopes that will be the case, he is the local sheriff after all.A quick reveal shows that Seth and Richie are indeed nearby, and after an action packed and frankly hilarious shootout they leave the smoldering remains of the bottle-O and hit the road.The Gecko's aren't your regular petty crims, Seth (George Clooney) is the heavily tatted mastermind, cool, calm and calculated. All business. While Richie is deeply insecure, cold-bloodedly violent and basically f*cking nuts, always a good combo.They are indeed on the way to Mexico, to be more specific a backwater town named El-Ray, where they will be meeting their fence, (the guy who will buy the stolen goods), but first they must cross the border, where they are Public Enemy #s 1 & 2.Enter Jacob, Kate and Scott, a family on holiday in their camper van. Jacob has lost his wife in a car-wreck, which made him question his faith to the point that he has given up his role as a Priest, Kate and Scott are his children, the fact that Scott is of Chinese descent is acknowledged but never explained.Seth and Richie abduct the entire family and demand that they escort them across the border to safety, now even though Jacob has a troubled past he is still humble, yet steely determined, and he initially says ""no chance"". That is until Seth threatens to sic Richie onto Kate.Now to expedite proceedings after some shennanigans they find themselves across the border and in Mexico, where Seth directs them to a local bar called the Titty-Twister for celebratory beers.Now up to this point the happenings in this film were only improbable. Here it gets a little bit crazier.At the totally O.T.T. Titty Twister the Tarantino part of the film ends, the rest being all Rodriguez. The bar is populated by heaps of familiar character actors and film personalities, a short list includes Cheech Marin, Tom Savini, Greg Nicotero, Danny Trejo and Fred Williamson, Salma arrives later. The bar has strippers and crazy dancers, an inhouse band, surly staff and dangerous looking clientÃ¨le.Nice.After some petty fights involving various staff and drinkers, (featuring what I would venture a guess as being the first genital cannon in cinema outside of porn!) the tone slips down a notch, as Salma arrives.53 minutes running time.Salma plays Satanico Pandemonium, the exotically named, exotic looking, exotic dancer, complete with the previously mentioned albino reptile. Over the next three or so minutes she puts on a dance that has the bar transfixed, and I dare say many bars in the audience were transfixed from this point too.Now up to this point the happenings in the film were only wildly improbable. Here it goes cuckoo-f*cking-bananas! 58 minutes running time.Salma, (as we know it) moves on, and all sh*t breaks loose.The remainder of the film has scant plot aside from the fact that our characters are beset by honest to goodness vampires from this point on until the credits. There are numerous sightgags, some effects work that is equal parts dodgy and inspired, and gore galore, but all of it more cheesy than cringe-inducing.Most ""standard"" vampire rules apply, stakes, holy water, crosses etcÂ and the small group of surviving non-bloodsuckers must make it to dawn to see if the final rule, that of death by sunlight, applies.There is some great dialogue, frenetic action and inspired chaos, there are also some quite hilarious intermissions, most notably Fred Williamson's 'Nam recollections that seem to ramble on and on, all the while becoming more animated.While this isn't as critically embraced as Pulp Fiction or even Sin City, and with reason, From Dusk Till Dawn is amazingly efficient genre-busting film-making. I've said before you can't watch the same film over and over again without getting bored, you need some variety, something different sometimes.The fact is that From Dusk Till Dawn is likely totally different from almost anything you'll watch this year. But it is also a great film, and hugely entertaining.Final Rating â 8 / 10.

This movie contains pointless nudity and violence (Tarantino's character rapes and kills a woman simply for the sake of shock value). It is also far and away Harvey Keitel's worst performance.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
A grisly classic - not to be missed,"There are few people nowadays who don't know From Dusk Till Dawn's 'twist.' Originally, it was two separate screenplays - one about bank robbers fleeing the authorities and the other about a standoff against vampires. Quentin Tarrantino decided to combine the two and package it as one film. The result: awesome.Although not directed by Tarrantino (instead, he casts himself in a leading role), it has a totally Tarrantino feel. Two bank robbers abduct a family in an attempt to escape the law and flee over the border into Mexico. Unfortunately, they run into a whole bar-load of vampires and are forced to team up in order to survive the night.Yes, it may sound like many similar films, but for a start it has an impressive cast, featuring a (young and unusually nasty) George Clooney, Tarrantino himself as Clooney's creepy, psychotic younger brother, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis and plenty of cameos from other famous faces as either vampires of those destined to drive a stake through their hearts.Expect slow-building, rambling dialogue, not to mention the inevitable foul language and violence.If you like either Tarrantino's films or general action/horror, mixed with healthy doses of black comedy, then you really should watch this.And, guys, if you haven't seen Salma Hayek's 'snakedance,' you really haven't lived.

They take the Fullers hostage (Keitel, Lewis, Liu) and successfully get across the border. Their accomplice, played by Cheech, has them wait for him at an isolated bar and then, the trouble starts. A bar full of vampires, what do you do? Fight your way out in some of the goriest and best slaughter scenes I have seen, all along making hilarious wise-cracks.

"Despite it's bad points, a great horror film.","If you don't know the story behind it getting made - basically, Robert Kurtzman wrote the story, he wanted it turned into a screenplay. He did makeup effects on Pulp Fiction for free in exchange for Tarantino writing the screenplay.There's basically two problems with the film. One, is that Rodriguez isn't all that good at the horror genre. The other is that the story has a few sour points - especially the ending, which feels artificial to me.The first hour is great, because Rodriguez is good at that sort of story - gangsters on the run. It's so good, it makes the second half - the vampire story - a little too jarring. I love the concept of getting an extensive background on the characters involved in a horror film, instead of simply thrusting a bunch of people into a situation before we even get to know them. What sours it is how the vampire story is handled. It's very conventional. We get some additional characters to contend with in the second half, and while they're playing stereotypes on purpose, they seem too cartoonish even in the midst of gooey vampires. I will grant that Rodriguez has some fun with the stereotypes, though, such as Fred Williamson's speech.That's the main problem with Rodriguez's vision. I don't like the vampires in the film. They're gooey and gross and ugly. Now, I'm not into the vampire mania of recent years, but I just found the vampires too uninteresting. They've lost what makes them unique as villains, and could be nothing than a bunch of raptors. The film also delivers just a touch too much gore - I like gore, but it has to be in proportion to the mood of the film, and this was a little heavy - not surprising considering the story came from a great splatter effects artist looking to show off his craft. Still, it detracts, especially after how nicely the scene where Clooney discovers what's happened to the hostage while he was picking up food is handled.While this seems like I'm on the negative side of the film, I'm not - I love it. The dialogue, Tarantino's domain, is sharp, funny and interesting, just like his previous films. It's delivered very, very well by Clooney and the rest of the cast - moments such as his ""Pyschos do not blow up when sunlight touches them!"" speech, Juliette Lewis's casual ""Thanks"" after Clooney knocks out his brother, his dialogue with the hostage at the beginning of the film, and his and Keitel's dialogue on the way to Mexico. Great stuff, and it makes the film more than worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.I also have to say that Salma Hayek's dance is possibly the most erotic thing ever put into a wide-release film. It's worth the price of admission alone.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

From Dusk Til Dawn - A unique & original Film,"'From dusk Till Dawn' is a vampire/horror flick unlike most others. Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez came together after finishing 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Desperado' (respectively) to make this film, which was when they were at both  (arguably) at their peaks (peaks in fame, it is much hard to say when someone had their creativity peak). The uniqueness of this film stems from how there are no vampires, or hard-core action, for the first half of the film. Then it shifts gears and turns into a blood-bath shoot'em up show. Until this change in the style of the film happens, this show could have been finished in endless ways (I can't really give examples of this without spoiling the film. with the exception that before you see any vampires, they could of finished this movies as a non-vampire movie). The start and middle of the show can stand independent of the rest of the film (it still leads up to the end of the film). I found the dialog to be cleaver and funny. George Clooney fills the shoes of the main character very well (that is, he acts as a smart confident professional criminal). This movie is, without a doubt, a cheesy and cheeky horror show. But as long as you know what kind of film to expect, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' can be a very enjoyable flick.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Entertaining Vampire horror movie,"I enjoy watching this movie throughout, and it is worth a watch. It's interesting how there feels like two different genres in this movie. The first half is more like a crime thriller with two criminal brothers trying to cross into Mexico while committing some crimes. It does a good job introducing the brothers and the family that they take hostage. I like the gritty look and tone the movie presented here, which works with the atmosphere of the movie. Things become horror in the 2nd half, and it really picks up. There's a lot of action that happened in it with the vampires showing up and the characters trying to survive against them. It brings up the suspense and tension towards it and is the highlight of the movie. The movie also has an awesome climax to it on the type of weapons they use throughout it. The characters aren't the most developed, but they are still pretty good characters. I found the special effects to be really great in the movie, which comes later on in the movie. There's a lot of great practical effects in it, like the vampire makeup, the transformation, gore effects, and the explosion. I really like how detailed the vampire are with the makeup effects and how different they are compared to other vampires in different media. There are also a bunch of graphic deaths to be found in it, and it looks great with the practical effects. I also like the setting of the building on how it looks and the details the filmmakers put into it.From Dusk Till Dawn is an entertaining horror movie that I enjoyed watching and is worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Nice movie,"As i watched this movie 3 times, i am ready to do it for the fourth time i really enjoyed and recommend this movie for every one who love movies. The story (by Kurtzman) is a very good mix of action, western and horror cleverly put together in Tarantino's witty script. Rodriguez direction gives the film the a 70s feeling that gives the movie a Drive-In spirit pretty much in tone with the plot. In fact, at times the film feels like an updated version of exploitation action films of that era. This lack of pretensions makes it even more enjoyable as it never tries to be something else than pure entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
ONE OF THE BEST FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN,"I think ""From dusk till dawn"" is a masterpiece. I have to see it in Italian, unfortunately, but I'd like to see it in English too. The bad Gecko brothers are incredible, the elder, Seth, is a thief, sometimes a killer, but he's not as crazy as his ""little"" brother Richard, who's a real psychopathic, full of visions that in his ill brain seem to be real. For instance, he causes the death of a man beacause, only in his mind, he saw him asking for help. But that wasn't true at all! Moreover, he imagines that a girl, the priest's daughter, asks him for a special...favor...well, you must know...The best surprise of the film is the one in the ""Titty Twister"", where a lot of people become blood-thirsty vampires. Bad Seth will have to need God's help, to defeat 'em. I do suggest to see it, if you still haven't. My vote is 10, from 0 to 10. Bye bye.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Just great!!!!!!,As we come into the world of Tarantino & Rodriguez we know that it will be astonishing..... And it is! Vampires are very easy to kill but not these vampires. They have something that is very interesting and it is called Salma Hayek.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Quentin Tarantino  writes a horror movie,"If you read my one-line summary and have seen any of Quentin Tarantino's other movies, then you probably know what to expect from this one. It's violent, depraved, twisted, darkly comic, and it has great dialog. This description applies to just about anything Tarantino is involved in, and ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" is no different in that respect. Where ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" differs from other movies written and/or directed by Quentin Tarantino is that it is the only movie that he has done where the second half of the movie is devoted to a bloodbath involving a horde of vampires, a Mexican strip club, and a guy with a gun hidden in his codpiece. If that last sentence didn't inspire you to go out and rent this movie right now, then I feel truly sorry for you.This movie is what every cheesy horror movie often fails to be: it's a lot of fun. The sudden change that the movie undergoes from being a typical Tarantino-style film about two criminal brothers who take a family hostage while they make their way to Mexico to being an all-out, over-the-top gore-fest featuring vampire strippers is very strange and really doesn't make much sense, but if you're anything like me you really won't care as you sit back and enjoy the pure insanity that could only come from the mind of Quentin Tarantino as he writes a horror movie. Of course, part of the reason why this movie works as well as it does is that everything is handled with a tongue-in-cheek sense of humor that keeps the movie from taking itself too seriously. While the violence is incredibly graphic (this is easily the goriest vampire movie I've seen in years), it is slightly lessened by ridiculous sights such as the vampire band leader playing a guitar made from a human corpse, Cheech Marin tastefully telling customers of the vampire strip club about the variety of pu**y available, and the aforementioned codpiece gun.From watching this movie, it's pretty clear that no one involved was looking to make a cinematic masterpiece, but it was clear that everyone was having a blast. It's as violent, over-the-top, and pulpy as movies get, but I guarantee you probably won't see a movie like this for a long time. Just sit back and watch the insanity and have fun.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

"Like GRINDHOUSE, this movie is half Tarantino, half Rodriguez","This film is a bit peculiar because it mixes two very different kinds of plot and movies' genres, and that's just because of that it works so well. In the ""first half"" we watch a crime story with two outlaw brothers, SETH GECKO (played by George Clooney) and RICHARD GECKO (Quentin Tarantino) running away from authorities, after robber a bank and kill a few people. They kidnap a family, composed by a Pastor who lost his faith, JACOB FULLER (Harvey Keitel), his daughter KATE (Juliette Lewis) and his son SCOTT (Ernest Liu), and cross the border into Mexico. Arriving there they all go to a motorcyclist's bar, in the middle of nowhere, which claims it self to be ""open from dusk till dawn"". The ""second half"" begins! After a great show by ""SANTANICO PANDEMONIUM (Salma Hayek)"", a bloody and gory fight starts between these mentioned characters (and some new and funny ones which only appear in the bar, like the ""SEX MACHINE"") and some vampires (which are the owners of the bar and the stripper girls). A very different kind of plot and ""movie"" begins! From a crime and kidnapping story it passes to a gory vampire slasher!The main idea is quite original and funny, and we can feel Tarantino's touch on it. The screenplay is from him, in spite of the original story not be. I think it's another classic of the 90's, not because it's an excellent movie, but because its main idea worked very well and was quite refreshing. I also appreciated its humor and the great acting from the main actors. Tarantino included! The soundtrack is also fine, especially when they arrive at the bar. On the other hand, we can also notice Robert Rodriguez's directing through the many action scenes, done in his personal styleIn fact, I would say it was the first experience where Tarantino and Rodriguez joined their personal styles to create a film. We can watch such idea more developed and matured in their recent GRINDHOUSE, but I think it was the very beginning. Because like GRINDHOUSE I think this film is separated in two very different parts: the first one with Tarantino's cinematographic style; and the second one with Rodriguez's!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

A fun and funny vampire horror comedy,"From Dusk till Dawn-George Clooney, Julliette Lewis, Harvey Keitel, Quentin Tarantino, Ernest Liu, Cheech Marin, Fred williamson, Danny Trejo, Tom Savini, Salma Hayek, Michael Parks and Tito Larriva.WOW! This is one of those fun to watch on a boring night movies, and it is great. It is about two thieves (Clooney and Tarantino((Tarantino is also a murderer)) who take the Keitel, Lewis, and Lui family who take them to a Mexican strip club which is run unbeknownst to them, vampires. It is silly and gory, but at the same time, really great. Michael Parks plays Sheriff Earl McGraw in the opening, and is a great actor. He has been in Kill Bill 1 as Earl(despite the fact that he dies in this one), Kill Bill 2 as a Mexican pimp, From Dusk till Dawn 3 as the star of it and other films. Hayek has the best striptease in this too and she is HOT!!!!! 8/10 stars. R for gory violence, some sexual innuendo, language and nudity.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
Delicious hybrid of crime-action and camp horror,"The Tarantinoesque sub-genre which arguably originated with Tarantino's penning of True Romance (1993), reaches its baroque phase in record-breaking speed with this delicious hybrid of crime-action and camp horror. Tarantino wrote and co-starred with George Clooney as two ruthless bank-robbing, murderous brothers, with buddy Robert Rodriguez directing. Rodriguez and Tarantino had collaborated on Four Rooms a year before and their similar style, especially when it comes to their glamourized, often protracted shooting of violence, made them a perfect fit. In From Dusk Till Dawn they are still offensive-minded - their success had not yet caught up with them and made them feel they had something to lose - and Tarantino's writing is as crisp as it ever was. The first hour of this film is filled with as much great dialogue and clever setups as Tarantino's best films, and the authenticity that Clooney, Harvey Keitel and Juliette Lewis bring helps the cause further. Nevertheless, Tarantino steals the show also in the acting-compartment; his performance as a sexual predator who can barely restrain himself is a joy to behold (if you pardon me saying so).The turning point in From Dusk Till Dawn appears just after the hour mark, when the Clooney character's recklessness angers the hosts of the strip club they're visiting in the middle of the Mexican desert, resulting in our cast of characters getting more than they bargained for. The shift in tone, and indeed genre, is sudden, but doesn't feel like backstabbing of the audience, arguably because our two protagonists have been so outrageously unpredictable and inconsiderate up until this point that we're ready to expect anything. Out goes the semi-poetic realism of the film's first half, and in return we get an adrenaline fest of horror-comedy realized by and starring make-up effects maestro Tom Savini. It's more amusing and fascinating than fun, really, but the filmmakers certainly accomplish their mission of creating something original. And the ending is, believe it or not, in good taste.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

Dusk till dawn,"This movie is a good example that George Cloony can play any type of role...Great action and great performances by many...Scenes are outlandish but will make you laugh, make you cry, and make you scared...This is a movie that you have to see more than once to get the full content....Harvey Keitel is always a classic, George is tremendous, and Julie is always a beauty to watch and enjoy...she is loaded with that special kind of sex appeal that exists in some actresses that can play such a gross role and still be loved...The vampire scenes are a little far reaching but they are put together so that they arouse you feelings and attention and at the same time add some Cloony comedy to the entire farce of a great flick. the film makes you think, makes you devious, makes you love the absurd, makes you want more , and establishes the hunger for more of the same. Someone should do a follow up, but I wonder if George Cloony is still on the market for this type of action.

Entertaining Thrill Ride!,"'From Dusk Til Dawn' is an action-packed thrill ride that anyone can enjoy. If you are going to watch this movie to critique it, you should probably know a couple things. The acting in it is pretty decent. Clooney and Tarantino do pretty well in their roles. Not their best performances but they do a pretty good job. Dialogue is not great, editing is average. However, you will be pleasantly surprised by the makeup effects. My advice, have fun with this movie. It is very entertaining, just sit back and enjoy it.For the horror fans, you will absolutely love it! The movie starts off a little slow, but once you get to about the 40 minutes mark, things escalate quickly. LIke I stated before, you will be amazed by the makeup effects in this film. The vampires are real cool and may be some of the coolest vampires ever in a movie. Also horror fans, you will notice makeup/ special effects legend Tom Savini has a role in this film! For what he does, he is great and you will definitely get a kick out of it. Another thing viewers should note going into this movie it is more of an action movie than horror, but there is also a little dark comedy in it. It all actually meshes very well.Overall 'From Dusk Til Dawn' is a very entertaining movie. Awesome makeup effects and lots of creative stuff in this film! I would definitely recommend it to the everyday movie watcher, especially horror fans like myself. 'From Dusk Til Dawn' gets an 8/10 stars from me.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"

This movie also has other big name stars like Salma Hayek, Harvey Keitel, and Juliette Lewis that do a great job in supporting roles.

From Dusk Till Dawn,"At almost 20 years old, it's a darn shame for me to see that I have never seen this movie. So to keep my ""credibility"" as a cinephile, I finally said to myself ""self, watch this movie now, no more waiting."" I also asked myself, ""what do I know about this movie?"" Well, it's got Clooney, Tarantino acts in it, Salma Hayek has a sexy dance with a sexy snake, and vampires are a big thing in the movie. Even knowing all that and with the movie being as old as it is, this movie completely caught me by surprise.George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino play two criminals, Seth and Richard Gecko, that are on the run, which we find out right off the bat, in a incredible opening sequence in a gas station. There eyes are set on the Mexican border for an escape, so they spot a little family (the father played by Harvey Keitel) traveling in an RV and get the idea to hijack the vehicle and take the polite family hostage. When the group get's to there destination, a shady little Mexican bar, all hell breaks loose when vampires turn out to run the place.It sounds corny, it sounds cheesy, campy, laughable, maybe a bit over the top, but BY THE NINE, this is not only a cool crime movie, not only is it a dark, creepy vampire movie, but this is a great movie in it's own right. It's so unique and good at how it tell's the story, and you gotta give major credit to director Robert Rodriguez, because the first half of the movie just feels like a dark, gritty, crime-thriller and if the movie would've just kept that tone through out I would've been perfectly fine, but once the setting jumps the fence into Mexico, a whole other level of a movie is unleashed.George Clooney gives one of my favorite performances I've seen from him, he has this menacing screen presence that he doesn't show anymore and I thought was really good. Harvey Keitel is always great in his more gruff roles, I thought he was terrific as the father of the distressed, kidnapped family. It's a bit of a different role and he did a very good job going back and forth with George Clooney. Salma Hayek, my goodness, no words can describe the spell I was in with her screen presence. It's not a groundbreaking role by any means, she's there mostly to look good and that she does. Tarantino has a larger than normal role, he was enjoyable as well, but his real contribution to this movie is his screenplay. The dialog is so spot on and really meshes perfectly with the more crime driven first half.Vampires are kind of a punchline in movies now a days, this film gives the fanged creatures a very good treatment. There's a lot of use practical effects and make-up, the vampires look creepy and demonic and the action is filmed well. There's a shot that stands out to me in the beginning, where Clooney and Tarantino are walking away from a gas station store engulfed in flames. It's one continuous shot, and as the actors are saying their lines, in the back you see flames spitting out and little explosions throwing debris everywhere, you can tell it was done on set, and I loved it.I loved the vampire ""twist"" at the end, but I will say that the horror element did kind of get me at a stand still moment, only because the way the movie started as this really intense crime thriller with these two brothers intrigued me. I would have liked to see them stretch on that further, but the insane second half still did it for me, it was a fun watch, and has officially became my favorite vampire movie of all time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
This Is One Wild Ride,"Plot In a Nutshell: Two violent bank-robber brothers cross the southern border and take their hostages to a Mexican dive bar, only to find a rather sinister surprise when darkness falls.Why I rated it an '8': This film is one wild ride. Part crime thriller, part horror film, part exploitation, part comedy. Throw in a good soundtrack and some imaginative camera shots (the woman in the car trunk in the intro, for example) and you have a pretty good recipe for fun.This film is not meant to be taken seriously, but its idea of humor can be off-putting to some. Tarantino's character, in particular, comes off as wholly unsympathetic in his wanton displays of violence. Clooney looks better as the more reasonable, if still dangerous, younger brother. Harvey Keitel impresses as the hurt and dejected former minister who finds a new reason to return to his faith (and who wouldn't, in this situation) lol.Roger and me: Roger Ebert liked the film and gave it 3/4 stars in his 1996 review. I'm with you, Roger. This is an easy film to watch, where you can turn off your brain and just enjoy the show.8/10. Would I watch again (Y/N)?: This was my 2nd watch.

"It's still the fast talking, slickly delivered, blackly comic and severely entertaining flick it always was.","From Dusk Till Dawn is the original 'Grindhouse' Tarantino/ Rodriguez featurette, a film that feels like one person has created one half before the second guy just takes over and finishes things off in their own style. It is the perfect balance; Tarantino, who was best known for Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction at the time, begins the film with his crime fuelled tale of two lowlifes getting up to crime-driven no good before Rodriguez takes over to create an explosive finale which brings about an element of the guilty pleasure as violence, entertainment and convention round things off.Like most films penned by Tarantino, From Dusk Till Dawn begins in a road side location-come-diner (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction and Natural Born Killers) and sees a perfect balance of terror, suspense, dry humour and that wonderful dialogue Tarantino is able to come up with when a local trooper delivers a story to a store owner about how he had a recent case of food poisoning. The immediacy of the two would-be lead characters is a jolt to the audience, foreshadowing the 'jolt' Tarantino will give us later on when he introduces elements of the uncanny at the strip club. But the terror of the hostage situation, the dry exchange between the store worker and one of the leads and the consequent exiting of the store as it goes up in flames is a one sequence example of the sort of cocktail Tarantino can fabricate in his screenplays, all demonstrated in the opening scene.The two leads are the Gecko brothers, Seth and Ritchie played by George Clooney and Tarantino himself, respectively whom are both on the run from American law enforcers following a bank robbery and a blood bath of an escape. This is something the trooper establishes happened, thus implanting a dangerous image of the brothers whilst they're off screen. What transpires is a brief journey through the desert, an incident with a hostage and then an acquiring of a motor-home thus enabling the brothers to get across the border camouflaged. When they do cross the border, it is the signal for the film to change gears and begin to mutate into something else but not without wonderful touches as applied by both writer and director.Initially, my eye is drawn to the casting and the twisting of the rules that entails, echoing the twisting of the genre the film will undergo at the strip club. Prior to From Dusk Till Dawn, Julliette Lewis and Harvey Keitel had played characters in Tarantino penned scripts; only they played Mallory Knox, the psychotic and deeply disturbed serial killer in Natural Born Killers while Kietel played Mr White and Winston Wolf in two separate Tarantino films. Their characters in this project are far more muted than in those films, with Kietel not even dropping an f-bomb despite being teed up to do so. On the contrary, Clooney is cast as Seth Gecko, a loose and rather aggressively criminal who will kill and maim without much second-thought and this goes against the role he was best known for at the time, that being as a character in the rather reserved TV series 'ER'.The scenes involving Gloria (Hillhouse), a hostage the Gecko's have taken, act as scenes prolonging both Tarantino's style as a writer and an establishing of character traits. The exchange between Gloria and Seth is brilliantly slick in its delivery and pacing whilst maintaining a distinct tone of menace that the film wants the brothers to continue to have. It also goes a long way to prolonging the trait Ritchie carries to do with sexually driven desires of malice towards women when he does what he does to Gloria and this in turn plants a seed in the audience's mind. So by the time the brothers have apprehended the Fuller family and Juliette Lewis' character has entered a room in a swimming costume, the audience is fearing the worst. Additionally, the actress that plays Gloria was Tarantino's acting coach and he's quite clearly, perhaps disturbingly so, cast her as the hapless female who has what happens to her, happen to her as a direct result of Tarantino's character.The Fuller family are indeed made up of Kate, Jacob (Kietel) and Scott (Liu); the latter of which wears a visual clue on his shirt in 'Assault On Presinct 13' as to the 'last stand' scenario the film will adopt later on. When everyone arrives at the Titty Twister club, Jacob says a prayer in the form of 'out of the pond and into the fire', again foreshadowing that entering this establishment is a big deal to the film and doesn't just act as a waiting spot. But the uncanniest of incidences follows Chet's (Marin) 'pussy' monologue at the end of which he leans over into the camera and, rather eerily so, utters an obscenity directly at us as we look up at him from ground level. It's a bizarre occurrence and for the film to suddenly break the fourth wall creates an uncanny sensation that all is perhaps not quite right with this place. Unfortunately, the tactic might be lost on most viewers due to the absurdity, and possible hilarity, of the preceding monologue.Once in the strip club, the film cools off for a while and becomes something entirely different, but something still thoroughly entertaining. There is a rather random five minute or so dance from Selma Hayek's 'Santanico Pandemonium', during which Tarantino gets to indulge in his 'fondness' for feet, a scene that he wrote for himself to partake in. Regardless, From Dusk Till Dawn remains a favourite of mine; on a film-making level and certainly on a guilty, more entertainment driven level.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Horror"
