I feel like everybody has missed the point,"I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life.From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane.Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I cried like a baby..,"I watched the movie long time ago, and I've just rewatched it today.
For kids it will be a funny movie with no meaning maybe!!
But for an adult, its so true!! You lose your childhood personality you change you feel sad, i mean it literally touches my soul
Great movie for both kids and adults.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The fact that this movie has so many 1 star reviews is proof that there is no point in making great movies anymore......,"I hate to see so many 1 star reviews claiming this movie was ""too depressing"". Everyone who said that missed the point completely. Growing up ain't all sunshine and rainbows, it comes with a lot of hardships and that's what this movie is about. Riley's emotions try to help her through the difficulty of moving to a new place that isn't all its cracked up to be, and in the process Joy accidentally sends Riley into a deep depression. Sounds depressing, but what makes this movie great is how realistic her depression feels as Joy and Sadness try to help Riley out of it. I feel like this movie's message is ""Growing up will be tough, but you will get through it and there are people who will always help you through it."" and that is a VERY important message for children.Throughout the movie there are plenty of good jokes, gorgeous animation, and a beautiful score by Michael Giacchino (idk how to spell that....) Again, just my two cents, but I think this a great movie, if very different and a bit more depressing by Pixar standards.REALLY starting to think people are just coming to trash all of Pixar's most recent movies out of jealousy or something. There's no way so many people think this movie is garbage. If the good movies are really getting this many bad reviews, it's no wonder the quality of animated movies is going down. There's just no reason to try anymore......",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Mandatory watch for children and parents alike.,"I did exactly what I was supposed to when watching this brilliant movie, I felt all the emotions at some point.Pixar did it again with Inside Out. For a long time I had stubbornly repeated that Toy Story would always be my favourite from Pixar, but I changed my mind shortly after watching this one.Like Toy Story you were offered a setup every adult can identify. Growing up learning how to control your feelings and learning the importance of every one of them. It is okay to be angry, sad, happy and afraid as long as we are taught how to manage them.The idea of having this control panel inside a human body has been done before by Osmosis Jones (2001), but let's say with much less success. Inside out takes it to the highest level of perfection.I loved the way Pixar made this world inside the main character of Riley, it is very creatively done and was in some ways just how I had imagined it. I must admit that I cried a couple of times during the movie, because it has some really touching moments.You should be feeling all emotions when watching Inside Out. It is a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not for young children,"I confess that I had to watch this twice before I could properly assess it. It's definitely not a young children's film, as there's precious little to entertain them, but it does have much to consider for older children and (young) adults. As a rumination on what drives us all through life, this is very effective, but I do feel that the story lacks something for making Riley so isolated in her world. Perhaps if she interacted a bit more in the story, this would be a more involving film, but the reflections on lost innocence do add some poignancy and lift this film slightly above average.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An Interesting Concept with a Handful of Inconsistencies,"Inside Out is the hit Disney-Pixar animated movie about emotions, specifically emotions living inside a person's brain in a somewhat human form and controlling how people react to things. It's an interesting concept, and for the most part it's presented well, but there are flaws for sure.The plot is, like I already said, interesting but flawed. It bothers me that people are saying that this is an incredibly original concept despite the fact that it's been done before. It's just the most popular use of the idea, but it's not the original. The story itself, however, has a handful of really good ideas, but there are inconsistencies with it too. The disappointing part is that most of the inconsistencies are actually pointless scenes that don't add to the story but instead end up taking away from it. There aren't a lot of them, but there's enough to take away from the movie itself. Most of the inconsistencies would spoil the movie, so you'll just have to watch it to understand. Other than that the ideas are good and some are even pretty amusing.The characters are okay. I found the most interesting characters to be the parents personally, with Riley being as flat as a pancake and everyone else just not being important enough to even remember by the time the credits roll. For a movie about emotion, Riley really isn't presented in a very realistic way. Sure, at times she's good, but most of the time her character is just inconsistent. The parents were, on the other hand, much more consistent, and funnier most of the time.I think that this movie had a great beginning and a great ending, it was just the middle stuff that struggled. It's a very emotionally intense movie, especially towards the end. I felt much more into the movie at these points, and even on my third watch I got a bit emotional about the ending. The movie felt a little too short as well, but maybe that's because I've seen it so many times already.Overall Inside Out is just good. I think that I loved it so much originally (I gave it a 10/10) because of the ending. It was pretty emotional the first time, but after the second watch I started to question it. By the third watch I found inconsistencies and a handful of things that I just didn't like about the movie. Ideas and such that just weren't nearly as good as I remember. In the end I'd still certainly recommend this movie, but if you want to really love it then don't analyze it, because otherwise you'll notice the things that I did (probably).",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's best film since Toy Story 3 and one of their finest overall,"Most of Pixar's films are wonderful (short films too), and while the three films made after Toy Story 3 weren't up to their top standards they were still better than most animation companies at their worst. Inside Out was nothing short of a masterwork, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall.Pixar films can be relied upon to have great animation, and Inside Out certainly does have great animation. No, wonderful animation and some of the company's most ingeniously inventive, with gorgeously vibrant colours, a very imaginatively rendered setting (and the lands even more ingeniously done, the next land more so than the last), very meticulous and beautifully modelled backgrounds and clever character designs that match the emotions more than ideally. Michael Giacchino's sparkling, rousing and very charming score is one of my personal favourite scores of the year so far, and every bit as great as his score for Up.A superb job was done with the script here too, the comedy is clever and witty without ever being forced and balances subtly with the drama, the drama is some of the most truly poignant of any Pixar film and it doesn't ever feel manipulative or overdone and it's very smartly insightful. The story, not one of THE most innovative concepts but is one of the more imaginative uses of it and is quite original for Pixar actually, goes at a slightly steadier pace than other Disney films, but still captivated. It was very easy to completely connect with Riley and her situation and this was easily the Pixar film since Toy Story 3 that I connected with emotionally the most, also one of Pixar's most moving stories quite easily.Loved the characters too, Anger, Fear, Disgust and Bing Bong (the imaginary friend and the 'epitome of immaturity', without ever being annoying, his back story did bring a tear to the eye) stole every scene they were in, and even Sadness managed to crack some funny one-liners even in her depressive state. Joy also positively lights up the screen and Riley was easy to connect with and much more than just a stereotypical teen girl. The voice acting is splendid. Amy Poehler is note perfect as Joy with her spirited banter giving the character so much life while also bringing a human element to her as well, Lewis Black gives an explosively barn-storming turn as Anger, Phyllis Smith is amusing and affecting, Bill Hader and Mindy Kaling are similarly priceless and in a way that makes the characters of Fear and Disgust endearing rather than annoying, Richard Kind is innocently charming and Kyle MacLachlan and Diane Lane are appropriately compassionate.Overall, a masterful return to form for Pixar. It's their best since Toy Story 3 and one of their best overall as well. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great ride through emotions!,"Inside out is movie about emotions. Various emotions depicted in the movie are joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness. The movie is about a girl who grows up to 11 years of age and then faces, what we can say, her first major mental breakdown resulting in a sad core memory formation. This happens because of the reason they move from Minnesota to a new place. The dull phase of her life is gradually overcome as the movie progresses as she learns to handle emotions more nicely.A human brain consists of various parts. It's fair to say that activity in certain part is responsible for a specific emotion. The movie has portrayed it very nicely. Human brain is very complicated structure. How it works majorly remains a mystery. The work done in the movie is a great representation of available information. The movie shows how a human being matures in terms of his emotions. Its shown how the girl learns to handle multiple emotions in terms of memory.My personal favorite emotions(characters) go in order anger, fear, joy, disgust, and sadness. Anger being the most liked one. The movie is wonderful, great job done by creators. Fairly recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Beyond Words...,"It's been nearly a year since I first saw this film. I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.This is my favourite film ever.Like I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.Yet this is still my favourite film of all-time.80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.Ever since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).Inside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.In the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.You can vote ""not helpful"" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.I will never forget Inside Out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Didn't live up to my expectations,"I had high expectations for this movie, and I was quite disappointed when I finished it. I really hope Pixar does better next time, because this is not good enough.The people who gave it an 8, 9 or 10 out of 10 need to calm down though, and so do the people who gave it a 1, 2 or 3. It's definitely not amazing, but it's definitely not ""the worst"" either. Those who say it's one of the two are exaggerating.Personally, I think it's mediocre. It has some fun, interesting elements to it, and the concept is original. It starts out quite interesting, the beginning is the best part, but the rest is not as good. It relies heavily on clichés, and none of the characters feel original. None of them develop much either, not even the main character, they're predictable and quite boring. Actually, you don't really get to know them, not even Riley, which is pretty ridiculous considering the movie is set inside her head. The parts that are supposed to make you laugh only make you smile awkwardly, because they're so cliché. There is no ""wow factor"", and the ending was predictable. Definitely not what I would expect from Pixar.I wouldn't recommend or discourage people from watching it though, as some may enjoy it, but people probably shouldn't get their hopes up.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Older You Are the More You'll Like It,"Inside Out (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Eleven-year-old Riley has a wonderfully fun childhood thanks to the emotions working inside of her. Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) all help keep the young girl moving forward but when her family moves from Minnesota to San Fransisco it throws everyone for a loop and soon Joy and Sadness find themselves lost in her system and trying to find their way back.INSIDE OUT is certainly another winner from Pixar who are clearly the experts of the family movie. What really amazes me about the studio is that they're actually just making adult movies that kids happen to enjoy because of the pretty characters on the screen. I say this because films like this one, UP and WALL-E really do have adult stories dealing with adult issues yet somehow the studios are able to keep kids entertained while their parents get a lot more of the jokes and the emotions that the story provides. This one here is an incredibly touching story from a parent's point of view simply because of the changes that their kids go through.There's no doubt that the animation is the star of this picture and we're really treated to some wonderful images. I especially loved the use of colors in the picture and how various colors had a certain emotion attached to it. This is certainly excellent once our adventure begins as there's a ""long term memory"" section where these wonderful color marble like things are collection. Just the site of this are a true treat for the eyes. All of the ""emotion"" characters are perfectly brought to life with both Joy and Anger really standing out. The human characters are also quite entertaining and there's no doubt that the Bing Bong character will go down as a favorite decades from now.As I said, this film is going to work a lot better for older kids and adults as I'm sure the majority of young children aren't fully going to grasp the idea of emotions and how they effect our lives. The story itself is quite charming throughout and I was surprised at how many adult issues they were able to work on throughout the running time. Fans of Pixar are certainly going to love this as it's another winner that manages to work no matter what your age is. Still, I think the older you are the more you'll enjoy it.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
How?,"Wtf people. I was just reading like several one reviews and how do people get a movie so wrong?! It should be pg-13? It's not for children? Are these people out of there freaking mind?

"Amazing movie- Those who bash it because it is not a kid's movie, please stop","I've noticed a plethora of negative reviews all saying the same thing- their kids did not enjoy/ understand the movie and it was too dark. Yet they also say that the movie was well made and had an excellent concept. My question to these people is this- If you wanted to see a happy meaningless movie with adult toilet humour, why didn't you take your kids to see Minions? Inside out is for those who like quality cinema, to be entertained as well as taught challenging concepts. It is an artistic film. Why do you people always have to assume that all animated films have to be for kids and filled with stupid toilet humour? This is Pixar we are talking about, those who have created Wall-E and Up. Review this movie on its own merits, rather than be biased in your judgement that the film was too dark and confusing for kids. It was never marketed as a film for toddlers and little kids. I went with my brother who is in high school and it was one of the best experiences we had in the cinema in a very long time. Kudos to Pixar; it was truly an amazing, advanced conceptual, artistic film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
9/10,"94 minutes of pure joy and emotion. A return to masterclass from pixar and not only that, probably their best work outside of Toy Story 1 and 2. This film does deserves every bit of praise it has got and more. I will say without hesitation that if you haven't seen this film, believe me you should.Lets just start easy by saying that the animation is something other-wordily. We are beyond the point where anyone needs to express the fact that pixar's animation is gorgeous, but the fact is this animation is some of the most intelligent and dense animation I have ever seen. There are easter eggs in every single frame and more than that every visual element in the movie is well rounded and clearly thought out which makes the storytelling so much more gripping. Talking about storytelling, rarely does a film do visual storytelling so brilliantly. Five minutes into the movie I was in and I knew how things were rolling. This s really a lesson on how to think things out visually and how to use visuals to your advantage as much as it is possible, combining them to smart, engaging ideas.And now to the layers the film has. The deepness of its themes, the intelligence of its story, the subtext behind every action and word, the comedic touches, the insanely funny pop culture references, the poetic approach to joy and sadness, the emotional depth, everything, I'm telling you everything here is gut wrenching. There isn't one scene where you feel time is being wasted, there isn't one word a character speaks that doesn't feel genuine, there isn't one idea that is boring or unoriginal. This film is beyond emotionally engaging, this film gives you a mirror on which to reflect your life and think about it, but no wait it doesn't stop there, it also gives you the opportunity to laugh about it, that no matter what is going on there is also space for a laugh and for lightness. Wow.After a second viewing I have settled on the problem I originally had and can now honestly say this film really just has nitpick issues, it's truly a great one and definitely the best we've been given in 2015 so far. After my first viewing I was all enthusiastic about everything above, but I also was left a little confused by the mythology the film uses and wasn't quite sure it always fit. Upon a second viewing I guarantee that there is no such problem. The mythology is perfect and works with a solid and thought out logic that takes into account the chaos of life. What doesn't quite work is the fact that the film does have a few really minor shortcuts or conveniences that may stick out and I honestly wanted a little bit more of the control center room scenes and see some more of how it worked there, but then again I am really nitpicking.Incredible for me to say it, but I really want a sequel to this film, it's incredible. I want to see another two hours of the five emotions battling in out in the life of Riley and her further struggles, especially want to see the teenage years. This idea is truly amazing and special and it is so inspiring to me, I just really want a sequel to this film and that's the first time I've ever said that in my life.Trust me this film deserves every single bit of your attention and heart, it will take you on a roller-coaster of emotions and entertainment that is absolutely delightful and will also leave you thinking for days.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Tears of Joy,"Before I start, I will say this; I'm writing this after coming back from a second viewing of Inside Out. Both viewings were out of choice. That's not a unique thing, but I very rarely watch films more than once at the cinema, mainly because life is short, or rather, life is too quick for me. But there's two main reasons why people watch some films more than once at the cinema, especially where I come from; either the film was interesting, detailed, or multi-layered and needs to be seen again to sink in properly, or, it was really, really good.In this case, for me, it's the latter. That's not to say that the film isn't interesting, detailed or multi-layered, but the reason that was repeating in my head to see it again was 'it's really, really good.' But is it? Yes, yes of course it is... Speaking with a bunch of friends with whom I saw it the first time, a risky phrase was unanimously agreed upon, which was that we 'trust the Pixar team to do the right thing.' Needless (totally needless) to say that expectations were high, and frankly, they were surpassed.Even though the film is what we come to expect from Pixar (the universal moral themes, the perfect balance between comedy and sadness, and visually stunning animation and action sequences), I didn't feel that I had seen it all before, and neither was it repetitive nor 'ordinary'. The film hits all the high notes, with perfect intonation, and with discipline and passion. As touched on before, the balance between humour and sadness is strong and impressive; the amount of emotions that the film displays and takes us through is varied and immersive, yet not overwhelming. The film executes such clever ideas with simplicity and ease, leaving us to feel for the characters rather than worry about the 'science' of it all, or even being worried about 'not getting it'.The animation is constantly eye-drawing and detailed; the characters' glistening skin is particularly wondrous. And what great characters they are. Riley is brilliantly sympathetic throughout, even with her difficult mood swings, and the supporting characters are perfectly entertaining. One might think that the superficial nature of the characters (Anger is angry, Fear is always scared etc.) would become old quickly, however the fun never diminishes, thanks to a witty script, expressive animation, and very strong voice performances from the entire cast.However, to top all this off, the real gem comes from the character of Joy, surely a strong contender in the list of Pixar's greatest characters. Even though we are inside the head of Riley for the majority of the film, and the events that drive the movie are essentially her reactions to her new world (moving from Minnesota to San Francisco), the story is Joy's. Being probably the most flawed character in the film (paradoxically, maybe), it's her journey we care about the most, and she ends up being the most in-depth character in the film, occasionally questioning her actions in the first half (well, the cynics will be), and becoming the most sympathetic by the end. Amy Poehler's outstanding performance makes Joy simultaneously the strongest and weakest character in the film (emotionally, that is).After all of this, the freshness of the ideas, the simplified neuroscience, the technical brilliance (saying that, Giacchino's score is probably the most subtle thing in the film, exquisitely putting the finishing touches on the most emotional scenes), fleshed out characters and universal themes, all of this comes together simply to entertain us, to let us escape, and to release us emotionally, which it does by making us laugh and cry in an even and fair manner.And you will laugh. And you will cry. And it is fun to do so. Thank god we're living in a time when Pixar is making these films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Decently accurate depiction of part of the 3-ring sh-show we call life,"I have mixed feelings about this film. On paper, it's pretty well thought-out and care was put into it. The animation was solid. This is probably a good movie for parents and kids. I don't know why they wrote the parents, especially the dad, to be so two-dimensional and forgettable. Riley was also pretty 2-D, but with the added emo side. Then again, she's a kid, and that's kinda how kids are at that age.For people planning to become parents, this is at least an honest depiction of a stage of development. I rarely hear any nuance about parenting from wanna-be grandparents pushing their kids to have kids. They just laugh at their kids after the fact, saying, ""Oh yeah, I remember those years of no sleep, cleaning poop, the screaming. Are they destroying everything and rejecting all food yet? Just wait a few more years, and they'll become all emo and hate you! Haha! Have fun with hair loss!""New parents will tell it like it is, though. Almost everybody I know who's had kids is somehow shocked by the difficulties of it all at first. Almost all of them have said to me, ""You'll never have a CLUE how difficult it is until you're a parent."" Verbatim. I always think to myself, ""How tf did you NOT know?"" We've all been going through the different stages of struggle throughout our lives, and continue to do so. Certainly they've also been hearing the struggles of parenthood from other parents.Life has a decent amount of suffering. We try, because we're here, and we're programmed to survive as long as possible. Along the way, we try to enjoy the ride amap and, with the exception of Boomers, try to help the younger generations.Anyway, this movie was not at all a surprise to me. It's just running out a slice of the three ring sh-show that is life. I could barely get through it, because life stages are so typical and frustrating to watch played out, but at the same time, it's just the way things are. I hope the movie helps some people.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best Pixar Since Toy Story,"After some ho-hum years and too many sequels, Pixar is back and better than ever with Inside Out, a boldly unique animated film that renews our faith in what a giant studio can do with an original concept. Docter combines the strengths of his two Pixar masterworks here: the endless inventiveness of Monster's Inc. and the poignant strength of Up. A truly fantastic mixture of fantasy-adventure-comedy and small-family-drama, it's a genius work of conception, execution and emotion that will go down in the annals of Disney animation as an instant and enduring classic. It follows Joy, the leading-emotion of an 11-year-old girl, as she tries to navigate a big change in her young life. Much like Toy Story 3, we're shown the inherent difficulties of growing up through a fresh viewpoint, learning what makes you ""you"". It's a convoluted idea that's nearly impossible to explain, and yet Pixar nails it, perfectly shifting between its parallel universes with ease. The humor throughout will undoubtedly have kids and adults in equal stitches, with fantastic turns from everyone, notably Poehler, Smith, Black, and Kind. However, this film's high-point may be the multiple emotional gut-punches that will reduce parents to tears. That fearlessness to be gloomy is basically the thesis of the film: true joy comes when every emotion is allowed to be recognized and dealt with healthfully. It's quite a psychologically complex stance to take for a film that manages to be so kid-friendly. This wonderful balancing act helps make Inside Out worthy of the ""M"" word (masterpiece) and gives it the distinction of being Pixar's best since the unparalleled Toy Story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

However, Riley and her emotions struggle to adjust to Riley's new life in San Francisco and emotional disorder arises. Although Joy, Riley's main and most fundamental emotion, tries to keep things optimistic, the emotions fight on how best to navigate Riley's new world.After watching ""Inside Out"" with my wife, we both agreed that ""Inside Out"" is the perfect Pixar Animation movie for any family on a night out.

An artistic triumph,"For some reason, I couldn't quite catch this movie in theaters and I managed to watch it on an international flight. And boy, am I glad I did!As far as concepts go, I was astonished at the amount of detail and coherence in execution. The visuals are absolutely stunning, the colors rich and vibrant, the characters utterly memorable and some of the most poignantly heart-breaking lines of dialogue ever spoken/sung in any movie, let alone feature animation. It is every bit a Disney-Pixar classic and as emphatic a return to form as it can get.The story revolves around a young girl child who is happy in her world and has to suddenly acclimatize to another environment when her family has to move. Growing pains and social issues affect her while she grapples with increasingly complex situations, both at home and school. Meanwhile, the interplay between the five primary emotions inside her mind is both dynamic and fraught with compromises, much like how we deal with others everyday. As things come to a head and young Riley is about to make a life-changing decision, the events that follow leave a lasting impression, with an increased appreciation of the phrase ""emotions are what makes us human""!I recognized some dichotomies - for instance, Minnesota, usually perceived cold, is regarded as warm and comforting by Riley while San Francisco, renowned for its sunny weather, is seen as foreign and unwelcome. The other contrast I noticed was all five emotional figures (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust) do not always stay true to form, with Joy especially exhibiting nuances far beyond what her name implies - case in point, her touching admission preceding the last act (that entire sequence was too much for my eyes to take, by the way). All this might be considered a tad too much for young children to appreciate, but with time, they may probably realize how beautifully honest this movie was in trying to portray their growth and the underlying issues.Certainly, it is not without flaws: the plot meandered a bit 2/3rds into the length; Joy's ""A-ha"" moment seems strangely contrived, despite the impact it had; the music was adequate but not truly captivating as in the case of other Pixar offerings. But the beauty of this medium is that it offers filmmakers opportunities to steer audiences to more engaging experiences; Pete Docter and Co accomplish this with aplomb.In terms of cast and crew, the voice actors are superb selections - Lewis Black aces the Angry persona with generous dollops of sarcasm; Mindy Kaling is just perfect voicing Disgust; Richard Kind's performance as the imaginary Bing Bong is an absolute tear-jerker, while Kaitlyn Dias shows remarkable poise playing Riley. But it is Amy Poehler who steals the show in a coruscating blend of vivacity, vibrancy, and vicariousness. Her Joy is not an infallible leader, but one who accepts others in the face of challenging situations and plows ahead with inspiring positive energy. The animation left me spell-bound, especially the sequence where thoughts are shown to be abstracted, and are endowed with a lot of heart. The movie is fairly short, but a running time of 94 minutes is appropriate justice to a slightly heavy subject matter. The humor compensates with trademark Pixar staple of jokes, albeit intended for slightly more mature viewers. Pete Docter gave us the outstanding Up six years ago and ably accompanied by Ronnie del Carmen, has categorically demonstrated that he is a fabulous storyteller and a master entertainer.Inside Out is every bit a Pixar fan's well-deserved reward for patience. Do yourself a favor and watch this magnificent gem.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This is the Pixar I Know and Love,"Please excuse any mistakes as my English is not very good. There are no spoilers in this review.I had the pleasure of seeing 'Inside Out' at the Cannes Film Festival and I must say it was wonderful and a huge step-up from Pixar's recent efforts. The trailers don't really do it justice. The story may seem complicated for younger viewers, but the way Pixar tells the story fits for both adults and children. The pacing is in the vein of Wall-E, and in that sense it is very much a film for adults as it is for kids (like most Pixar movies). The story here is surprisingly raw and emotional, one that has very deep underlying themes that adults will connect with. Many of the audience members were crying at the end. It has one of the most original stories for an animation in the last few years, and I believe many people (especially adults) will form a connection to it.Speaking of animation, the film is breathtakingly beautiful. There is a nice contrast of colors that make it look vibrant, like Pixar's 'UP'. The voice cast did a wonderful job and you couldn't ask for better direction from Pete Doctor and co. I cannot wait to see this a second time with family and friends. Highly recommended.PS: The short that played before the film, 'Lava', was also beautiful. It was sort of a musical, and it was quite funny and clever. The audience even applauded at the end of it, myself included. In that sense, it provides the entire package a nice balance of joy and laughter (Lava) followed by deep storytelling and emotion (Inside Out).",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Ladies and Gentlemen, 2015's Best Animated Film","Disney & Pixar have made some worthy films that have become well known to audiences of all ages, but the last few releases haven't reached to the quality and standards they had established (in which the last great film they had made is both Up and Toy Story 3). With their latest offering, it is safe and proud to say that Inside Out establishes them back in the game of quality storytelling, animation and heart its concept.Inside Out explores the mind of a young girl, in her mind we are introduced to the emotions of Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear. They have the roles of controlling emotions that they see through Riley's point of view via headquarters, deciding how she reacts to them (for instance; if Riley was to be happy, Joy would have the controls to do so) and as well they collect 'core memories' that store into the long term memory of Riley in which we are throughout the film shown with moments of happiness, love and set her personality. However, when Riley's family makes a big move to the city it changes the roles of the emotions in Riley in which set off an adventure when Joy and Sadness (an emotion that is often pushed aside) are out What makes this film so well perfect is the mixture of imagination, heart and literally emotion; a concept like this may seem at first impossible to create for the screen but Pixar have come from out and beyond to create an original piece of work that is both open, inspiring and really makes us look in a new way of how our emotions and personal life experiences happen. The animation and use of the right colours for the characters is great and when I mean colour, the emotions themselves have specific colours that represent them as how we understand them. For instance; Joy is yellow, Sadness is blue, Disgust is greens, Fear is purple and Anger of course is red. Each of them has individual personalities that help to establish their roles; Joy is happy, bright and positive that makes Riley seem loved by those around her The emotion that the film carries throughout is further than what Up had already shown us (the well-known and acclaimed 'Married Life' sequence is beyond to what animated films can do to the heart strings), the film makes us personally understand not only the characters on screen but to personally relate to our own life events and personal experiences. The filmmakers have carefully observed on how emotions drive us, in particular Sadness plays a major role in the story that makes us wonder why we can't be sad throughout life but why it's important to be sad when the time comes. In particular, a key moment towards the end of the film pretty much got me and the whole audience (families, couples and even elderly people) in tears and yet understand in our own personal lives the times we get sad. This is a major point that I deeply thought was brought up perfectly and though the much younger kids may not have got it's point but I think from time to time as they grow up they will get the heart of it.Emotion aside, there are lighter moments when humour is present and gets the audience to laugh out loud. The character Bing Bong (an imaginative figure of Riley's earlier years) gives this best when he pops up in the plot, but as well Anger, Fear and the emotions in other human characters provide such humour and even discovering moments in our minds. The humour works very well in the film and it helps to keep the audience on a brighter side.Inside Out is not only a triumphant return to quality storytelling for the filmmakers, but it's both original and engaging for audiences to relate to. Bringing a new way to understand human life and our mind capabilities, the film is perfect for children, adults or even anyone young at heart. This is the best animated film for 2015 and it has a very strong chance in becoming Best Picture in the 2016 Oscars.The animated short 'Lava' that screens before the feature is amazing and different to the comedic shorts from previous years, having more heart and soul and a positive message about love and happiness told through song and colourful animation in detail.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A mature, animated movie","The film felt like a breath of fresh air, with a plot that used the interesting idea of being inside the 'head' of Riley. Inside Out wasn't exactly I expected to see from what the trailers had shown. A couple of moments had me laugh out loud, and others drove me to tears with emotion.There wasn't much action in the film compared to many others that Pixar have created, but I was moved in a way that many (shallow) blockbusters haven't done in years. I don't think children will enjoy this film as much as the 21+ audience will, due to the story being one that the ""older"" audience might relate to more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Alright Disney Animated Film,This is a fine and tough Disney animated film for all viewers to watch. Disney did an alright job in creating this animated film. The storyline was great. There were some parts that were not fully necessary. The cast selection was alright. They committed to the storyline. This Disney animated film reveals to viewers the depth and real insight of the emotions and the effects of everyone. Everyone needs to be aware and care about the feelings of others. The world today is even more dangerous than it used to be. No one has ever cared about my feelings. I have been bullied and hated all my life. This is a fine Disney animated film for everyone to watch.,6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
For mature minds,"I say this film is for mature minds cos i ain't trying to rule out kids or adults, just say that this film is intelligent.I went to see this film with girlfriend and the screen was filled with kids and their parents. Most the moms and dads were playing games on their phones whilst the kids weren't really paying attention to the what was going on in the film. It's a shame really cos I saw reviews by parents complaining that this film ain't for kids. I think it's a great conversation piece to have with your kids after the film and explain bits to them about sadness and happiness needing each other etc. There is a strong message there and it sucks that some parents probably more concerned about slating a film rather than exploring the opportunity to engage with their kids about the values in the story etc.I love this film and i think it's Pixar's best film in years easily one of the top films of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Very Osmosis Jones feel.,Just like Ozmosis gives children a fun learning experience. I would say 8 - 12 years - younger if the child is a deep thinker.Sort of movie you can stop and have a chat about particular lines and comments/ scenes. Which to me is half the fun of watching movies with kids .. seeing what they think and learn and laugh from.Cute enough delivery on explaining emotions and showing it's okay to have some emotions at some times.Explores how each emotion and character self-explores no matter what.A good teaching tool to open up a dialogue with some kids.

One Word,"There is only one thing to say about this film Brilliant!!! Pixar have topped all their past films with the absolute 10/10 animated film ever. Ticking all the boxes with comedy, visuals, emotion and intelligence Inside Out is so far the best film of the year.Inside out follows the story of the emotions within one girl's head and how they must restore happiness into her life, but by going on an emotional journey round her brain.But there are no further words this film is fantastic and a treat for everyone. This film is strongly recommended to all viewers and is a beautiful and fantastic piece of work.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Unique in a terrible way.,"Inside out shows the struggles of a child moving house. It tells to never loose hope. Now you may think this is a very simple story and good but it's more complicated than you think. Most of the movie is about these two characters joy and sadness trying to get back into the kids brain. Literally. This movie is way too complicated for what it is and it could have been really simple. Actually, I think they could have made the movie better without the cartoon characters: joy, sadness, angry, and whatever the rest are. Oh and also this movie is no fun at all. There are no laughs until the credits and I don't think kids would really like this at all. They were laughing tonnes when the minions trailer came on before the movie and when I came out of the movie all I saw was kids crying. I would really think twice before seeing this one. Congratulations Disney you have ruined another movie that could have been great. What happened to the times when you made Finding Nemo, The incredibles.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Inside Out is that emotional journey that has been missing from the movies for years. This is one of the best animated stories of all time!,"Inside Out may be the most cartoony story Pixar has released but it is also the most complex and mature. On the one hand, the majority of it is set within the mind of an eleven year old girl and her imagination, but the movie bears in mind (no pun intended) that the human brain is a complex organ that operates on many levels and circuits. The subconscious, abstract thought, memory and emotion all had to be given a physical form for Inside Out. Like a lot of people, I trust Pixar, yet didn't think that they had the talent to pull off something as unique, but crazy as the idea intended.I like to think of my brain running like a computer with perfectly synthesized control in place that's ready to deal with the many problems of the real world as the machine is quick to place the right emotion in time. Not every emotion is correct, but with the right mindset, the solution eventually comes. Everyone thinks differently and I wouldn't have been surprised if the film's focus picked a different approach. Inside Out also presents a human mind that does run like a machine, but actually gives a personality to each emotion to run it.A girl named Riley is living happily with her family in Minnesota. Her goofy and friendly personality is thanks to the emotion that runs her the most, Joy (played by Amy Poehler). She works with the other emotions, Fear (played by Bill Hader), Anger (played by Lewis Black), Disgust (played by Mindy Kaling), and not so much with Sadness (played by Phyllis Smith) to ensure that Riley remains that happy kid she is. But as with life, every kid has to come to their first big event that begins their journey into a full human. In this case it's a move.Riley's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and the emotions are having a hard time figuring out the best reaction. Joy would like to continue for Riley to stay happy, but Sadness starts to have the effect of changing past memories from happy to sad. A fight between Joy and Sadness causes them to be sent to long term memory, leaving the other emotions to run Riley. The child clearly has trouble adapting to the big city life and starts to shut herself out, even considering running away. Joy and Sadness must get back to headquarters to fix Riley, but Joy may not know what's best for everyone.Like Toy Story, Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and Up, Inside Out is a buddy trip story that works because of it's leads. Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith make a great time that work off of each other well. It's not just these two as all folks casted are well known comedians that are well placed in their roles. It kind of reminded me of The Lego Movie, but while that was meant to be a full comedy, Inside Out is one of the biggest emotional journeys ever put on screen.I would love to see the writing process that this movie went though as both stories (the real world and the world inside Riley) connect and play so well that either could operate on their own, but they still need each other. Riley represents that hard part of childhood when they discover that the world is such a big place that we all go through what she did; fear about what could happen to us, disgust at what we don't understand, anger when things go wrong, sadness when we are at our lowest, and joy when we finally realize that things can still go well even after all of that.I'll give this five happy memories out of five. Pixar has officially returned to form! Inside Out is the kind of movie that everyone will talk about for a long time; the kind of word of mouth that no one could ever buy; the one that kids will love the imagination from; the one that adults will find fascinating and emotional. Inside Out is a perfect movie and needs to be seen. It's not that you should consider watching this, but you NEED to see this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Worth watching...,"""Inside Out"" is an Animation - Adventure movie in which we watch the emotions (Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness) of young Riley trying to work together in order to navigate her as good as they can.I liked this movie because it was clever and its plot was something new and something that I had never watched before. The direction which was made by Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen was very good and they presented very well both the feelings and emotions of a young child. They also presented very well how important are the emotions of a child on hi/her evolution and growth.

Emotions trying to help a kid to adjust her new life.Have you all forgotten how you felt when you had to move away? From the place you've grown up at and made such good friends? Going to a new school? Possibly be a outcast?I personally think this film is good for both kids AND adults. There is silliness for the kids, but also showing stuff that parents could learn from this film. I think today's society is being too hard on films like this lovely one because it's basically showing real life problems from a realistic family/child.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An Intriguing View of Emotions,"As is often the case, before I could see this film, I had a host of people tell me how it affected them. Tears, creativity, uniquely presented emotions. This always shades the stuff I feel personally. While it didn't speak to me as much as others, I have to admit that it was enjoyable and highly creative. We have as our protagonist, Riley, a little girl who has been fawned on her whole life. She is happy like all kids with a few bumps along the way, as well as typical behavior. We find out that she has been formed by a set of emotions who take on an anthropomorphic being. The five of them create her personality. Unfortunately for her, the family moves from its idyllic setting in Minnesota to San Francisco, where everything is indeed different. During this time, the five emotions become unsettled and this becomes a kind of adventure tale. Joy and Sadness get shot out of their control center, and while they are finding their ways back, Riley begins to fall apart. The strength of this animated film has to do with all aspects of consciousness, such the area of creativity and art where the characters are turned into Picasso figures and later two dimensional figures. There is also the ""Train"" of consciousness, as well as some Freudian stuff to work with. Memories are save on little orbs and are at the center of putting a person back together again. An imaginary friend is brought in as well. This is quite adult at times, showing things that the kids just won't get. Well worth the time to see it. Oh, I know it's been said before. Stop giving movies ones unless they are deserving. Your job is to review, not to vilify things that aren't perfect. A one should be used to evaluate a cheap 1950's horror movie or an exploitation film, not a thoughtful animated feature that has charmed the vast majority of viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Aside from a few slow portions in the middle, a marvelous film from Disney.","One important note: If you go see ""Inside Out"" be sure to get there on time so that you can see the short that precedes it, ""Lava"". It's an amazing short film--one of the best CGI shorts I've ever seen. But, like ""Inside Out"", its audience really is adults, not kids.This film appears to have been inspired by a now defunct but wonderful exhibit at Epcot at Disney World. Cranium Command was a strange movie which featured lots of film clips and audio animatronics to embody the various emotions battling within a young boy. Here in ""Inside Out"", you have a group of entities that also embody the feelings...but in a young girl. When the film focuses on these five emotions, it's at its best---clever, fun and often sweet and tender. Unfortunately, the film loses its way a bit in the middle--and seems to have succumbed to some distractions. Fortunately, it finds its way very well at the end-- and ending which is incredibly satisfying and perhaps might require some Kleenex.The film is incredibly well animated and I was impressed by the 3-D version as it used this technology well. Additionally, the story is nothing like any CGI film I've ever seen. My only reservation is that the story might be a bit difficult for children to understand and the plot seems much more for older kids, teens and, especially, adults.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Too philosophical or technical for kids,"Somehow I don't really think that this movie is really suitable for parents to bring kids to watch. The basic concept is either too technical or too philosophical altogether. The concepts of humans' five basic emotions is well beyond the grasp of an elementary school kid, let alone a toddler. Even though the movie gets to be more and more reasonable as it goes on, still it won't be such a good experience to share about. The animation is nice, it doesn't have overly weird or disproportional drawing styles or camera angles that will further confuse children audiences. And the voice acting is nicely expressive. That should balance the things that this movie lacks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar has done it again. Maybe better than ever.,"Pixar has been the most daring animated movie studio this side of Japan.With marvelous examples like UP, WALL-E and Finding Nemo they always find the proper way to introduce themes that many deemed too heavy for children and in a way that's both moving and thought provoking, like life after the loss of someone we love, loneliness, social alienation and mourning.And now, we have Inside Out, the latest Pixar's work in an already fantastic oeuvre, and while it does not have the powerful drama and character development of UP or the magnificently executed reflection on solitude that was WALL-E it's no less complex as Inside Out choose to tackle something even more immediate: the complexity in our identity.Riley's personality is well built and relatable, quite an achievement since, if we are strict, we could consider her a big plot vehicle for the true protagonists: Joy and Sadness. The way these two interact with each other and with Riley's identity –cleverly presented as a set of corridors of memory and isles of identity– is a phenomenal example of intelligent animation.When you are sitting there just smiling to yourself about the brilliance of Pixar introducing psychoanalysis concepts to an audience composed mainly of children and explaining these concepts with clear and understandable visual metaphors you know you're witnessing something special.And of course, being a Pixar movie, the emotive scenes are there, ready to move you and take you with them. There's charm, there are laughs. There's plenty of what's lacking in the movies of Dreamworks and others: there's heart.I attended the premiere with my fiancée and my mother, who studied child psychology and worked with children with special needs for years and in the end she told us, with tears in her eyes: I never imagined something like this would ever be done. For my mother it was so moving and complex that she could not believe that children where understanding the movie so well.However, I'm a little skeptical and that's why I'm not ready to give this movie the full 10/10. The movie is indeed complex, maybe too complex sometimes, and I think I saw a couple of children –and adults– not understanding many aspects of this fine film. One clear example was the abstract thoughts chamber. I don't think all of us are ready for something this clever, at least not in this format. However I welcome it with arms wide open. It is time we start respecting the intelligence of children.Now, it's time for me to finish this, think about the movie for a while and take my imaginary friend to the moon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

One of Pixar's best !,"After the uninspired ""Brave"" and the lazy sequels to ""Cars"" and ""Monsters Inc"", it seemed that Pixar had transferred its talent to Disney and vice versa : ""Wreck-It Ralph"" and ""Big Hero 6"" clearly looked like Pixar productions, with their adult references and geek humour, while ""Brave"" was a traditional (dare I say boring ?) fairy tale and ""Cars 2"" a cheap sequel that Disney could have made. To me, it felt like Pixar was slowly losing the magic that made it stand out.Then came the trailer for Pixar's latest movie, ""Inside Out"", and suddenly hope was renewed ! I thought that it looked very promising and I couldn't wait to see it ! The idea behind the movie is pretty simple : what if we could see what happened inside a person's brain ? While the french TV series ""Il était une fois... la Vie"" did it from a documentary perspective, Pixar opted for a subtle mix of comedy, drama and insightful ideas.While the script may sound simplistic, it actually is really well thought out and everything falls into place perfectly. But the real genius comes from all the wonderful ideas the writers came with to materialize and explain how the human mind works.I'm not going to beat around the bush : this movie is simply brilliant ! The last time Pixar took a risk with a truly innovative idea, they gave us ""Up"", and it was a complete success! It's nice to see that there are still a few writers and producers willing to push fresh ideas to the big screen! My only regret is that it was too short ! I wanted it to last 30 minutes more at least ! They could have expanded their concept a bit more, but at the same time it is true that the movie is quite dense and fast paced : I found myself rewinding or pausing the film several times to pick up all the small but delightful details.""Inside Out"" is a rare example of a movie that I would love to watch a second time right after it finished, and that tells a lot about its quality! For that reason, it definitively deserves a place in my personal top 3 Pixar movies, right there with ""The Incredibles"" and ""WALL-E"". 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar has stepped up their game with this one it is up there with toy story and up. I recommend you see this movie it is fun for children as well as adults.

Psychology. The (brilliant) animation.,"After five years of relatively fine, solid releases, but with some missteps along the way, Pixar rises again and returns to its former glory with Inside Out.Inside Out runs on the tracks of an apparently straightforward plot of a possible life-changing event for young Riley to present a wonderful display of creativity and imagination, maybe the best from the studio.Human psychology is the setting where emotions come to life to tell the story of the chaotic and somewhat abstract events occurring inside Riley's head with exceptional attention to detail and an impressive clarity. Between nods to the studio's classics and the work of Hayao Miyazaki, everything is carefully thought and perfectly executed, adding an incredible depth and complexity to the amusing spectacle.From all charm and fun to its heart-breaking moments and bittersweet realizations, there is no doubt that Inside Out deserves a place among the likes of Wall-E or UP. And although it suffers from a lack of a toys-holding-hands-in-a-furnace moment, Inside Out winds up to stand out as the most daring and inventive Pixar film to date - and one of my favorite displays of apathy ever.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

But Pixar proves again, that even though the idea might be out there, it is able to make it work on so many levels with the layers attached.Giving feelings a face and make them react a certain way is amazing. Giving them a way to grow and learn as if they were humans just adds to that whole thing. There is so much going on here, that it would take too many words and space to go into detail of it all.

This is definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen in my life.The main plot is excellent and takes you to different parts of Riley's brain. Its visualization is stunning and imaginative. It's the world seen through Riley's young eyes and how growing up affects it. It is definitely mind-blowing and you always get this feeling: ""Oh yes, this makes a lot of sense now.""But definitely the best part of the movie is its climax. I won't spoil it for you, but for me, personally, it has so much depth and truth in it. I will always remember the climax of this movie when I'll be dealing with difficult stuff in life, because it calms me down. That's why this movie is so brilliant. It actually teaches you something about yourself and shows you a way to be emotionally stable person.Is it a movie for children? Absolutely yes. It's for children, for adults, for dogs and cats also, for extraterrestrials too! Anyone, who dealt with something difficult in his/her life, will definitely enjoy this movie and probably love it too.I give my bows to Mr. Docter and his team for creating this marvelous movie.

Don't believe the hype!,"We know Pixar can do animation. Is the animation in this one good? Yes, it is, I admit it wholeheartedly. The rest is the story, which is boring as hell.We are used to animations from Pixar that are watchable by the entire family, with enough oomph to make children happy and enough subtle smart to make the adults enjoy the movie. This one is a failure not because children won't enjoy colorful impersonations of base emotions, but because for an adult it all goes from boring to insulting.There is an enormous hype calling this an intelligent story that talks about the inner emotions of children and people in general. It does, but with the subtlety of a sledgehammer. I dumbfoundedly watched a confused jumble of 1940 psychology colored psychedelically to please infants and high people and that had only one hint towards sexuality and none about actual conflict.Not only this could have been better in all respects (maybe including animation), but the best parts for me where that they didn't use celebrities for voice actors and the funny credits scenes. The rest was like watching little kid cartoons, you know, the ones that we wouldn't want any child to watch because they look like they're made by psychotic Coca Cola addicts, but they still put them on on every TV post made for kids.The ""deep"" message of the film, that we don't have to always be happy and that sadness has its purpose and that things are not only black and white (or blue and yellow, whatever) cannot save the utter boredom and pointlessness of the rest of the film. Compared to other Pixar films, this is a disgrace.Bottom line: I am afraid the only thing I don't feel about this movie is joy. Plenty of anger, disgust and sadness, though.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Traveling far, without stepping outside","To simplify complex things without losing their complexity is an utmost art. So I marvel at what they made work here and how deeply illuminating of life with such simple pieces, toys essentially. I believe it will go far in estimation. It's not intellectual - but it's driven by surpassing intellectual ability. It's inspirational - but colors everything on the way out with something that goes beyond ""inspiration"".We have the animated ride about overcoming obstacles to be there for someone, the ride is great fun, the vistas imaginative; a lot of care went into making the inner architecture simple in textures and ""locations"", with childlike order. But the ride is transferred inside the mind of a little girl and they begin to build something else there.Five emotions inside the heroine's head vying for controls of life, directing a ""movie"". External reality seen through screens and ""cameras"" that project cinematic light that carries memory. Memories stored in gleaming orbs that contain them. Colors associated with emotions. All this very simple, it goes without saying, that in other hands or other contexts it would appear reductive.But the way it simplifies complex life inside the heroine's head to simple essentials that we can accept as building material for ours, how well they tied inner and outer so that I found myself nodding every time the bumbling ""emotions"" translated as believable behavior outside - all the different pieces come together by the end to form such a strong mechanism, simple without feeling like we have missed any nuance in the process. And all this as someone's soul at stake.So far so good, fun, vibrant, intelligent. Maybe the best Pixar already. And then they turn the gear once more and color everything - it's one of the most poignant endings I've seen, it floored me and I'm someone who doesn't give to just anyone the power to touch me.It illuminates - a happy memory only possible because of a sad one that preceded and these as part of the same flow - sadness that must touch all things - sadness that is joy and vice versa - multiply colored orbs now, each one a small gem of inferred ambiguous life. Each one a simple piece by itself. It has created a simple order in the soul, torn it and created another, simple but richer. With other animation films, we lose too much of our nuance in the process of simplifying, not here. The apogee is the lasting impression of seeing myself. Reflections released from their orbs and allowed to float would have a farflung (Malickian) view. But it's what we put into them from our ""orbs"" that lets us see. We would like our inner murk to be this simple so we accept it and are better off for it, nurturing our ability to see ourselves simply. To simplify complex things without losing their complexity is an utmost art. How much more so the art of simplifying ourselves without losing our complexity?",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Tremendous,"Amazingly complex animated film that builds the inside of an 11 year-old girl's mind as a fantastical world of wonder. Five basic emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust, live inside the mind of Riley and are in control of her attitude and memories. Joy (Amy Poehler) has done a good job of leading the emotions up to this point, but when Riley's parents drag her to San Francisco for her father's job, Sadness (Phyllis Smith) becomes more powerful, much to Joy's chagrin. The metaphors Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen have created in this girl's mind are insanely clever. Very quickly you get a bit ahead of the film, understanding Riley's emotional responses and the inner workings of her mind before we see her, in real life, react. It actually gets so abstract at times I think I wouldn't recommend the film for younger children - it probably is meant more for children closer to Riley's age, and their parents (and adults in general) will probably get more out of it than any child will. There's a bit of a slapstick element, and, honestly, sometimes it feels a bit out of place. As one might expect, the animation is wonderful. The fantastical world is beautiful, but for me it was the characters who really stood out. Joy in particular is one of Pixar's all-time greatest characters, and she's perfectly performed by Poehler. This is definitely one of Pixar's best movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

What Walt's Watching,"In my business of Voiceovers I've often said to clients meet the little voices inside my head...well in 2015 that's exactly what Pixar set out to explore with ""Inside Out"".It's a very clever film from the creators of ""Up"" (still one of my fave animations).In this highly original movie young ""Riley"" is uprooted from her Midwest USA life and moved to San Francisco.We get to meet her emotions - Joy (Amy Pohler), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Sadness (Phylis Smith) as they conflict on how best to navigate all the changes: a new city, house, friends and school, even a disgusting pizzeria that serves Broccoli on pizza dough.Peter Docter is the genius behind ""Inside Out"" both directing and co-writing this production.The damn thing won an oscar and had over 100 nominations in other awards!This movie even made me like Richard Kind as ""Bing Bong"", ""Riley's"" imaginary friend from her younger years.Let's face it growing up can be bumpy for all of us and that makes this movie even more relatable.Throughout life we are guided by our emotions and we don't always make good choices.One of the things I loved about this movie is it acknowledges the power of Sadness...showing it's ok to be sad...it doesn't necessarily mean you are depressed, just that Joy isn't always in control.Watch for: the end credits when we get an insight into how everyone (even cats & dogs) have a control centre in their minds headquarters.""Inside Out"" will make you laugh, cry and sigh.If so it's done it's job on so many levels in this adventure, animation, comedy.Do yourself a favour and check out the sequel ""Inside Out 2"" a stand alone movie, but it always helps to see the OG first.#DisneyPlus.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not for young children,"While very well done, and a favorite subject of mine, I felt Inside Out was very good for adults and perhaps children age 10 and up. The graphics were really good, the depth of the psychology was quite good, but the entire movie was strictly that theme and nothing else.The meaning of the movie is easily missed by younger children, and there isn't anything to hold their interest. I can't imagine Pixar will make much money selling toys based on this movie.I took our five year old to the movie. I have six children and this little guy is way ahead of his age for maturity, comprehension, and vocabulary. After the movie I asked him if he enjoyed it and he said yes. I asked if he knew what it was all about and he said no. He then asked me if I knew what it was about. I watched him during the movie and he was squirming, but twice he laid down and it looked like he was going to go to sleep; something he rarely does in the afternoon.It's sort of odd that this subject is covered in an animated movie which is normally aimed at the young crowd, but it missed on that age group. Then it is a subject adults can really understand, but it's animated which is not normally targeted at adults. Even teens, who could easily understand the content, might not appreciate the animation.All in all I find this kind of an odd mismatch.We own the Cars DVD and think that is a wonderful movie for adults and children alike.

I was very disappointed. Because Disney's and Dreamworks's motto has become ""money, money and money"". I have given up Disney long time ago.

A beautiful and amazing movie with a good message and great characters.,"So, I had the extreme pleasure to watch the new Pixar movie called Inside Out. This movie really surprised me. When I saw the initial teaser when I went to watch Big Hero 6, I didn't think much of it. Months later, the movie is getting closer to release, and I finally saw the theatrical trailer, and it sold me. From the start of this movie, the visuals are beautiful. And I'm not just talking about the art style, which is beautiful as well. It's just the things the show you is truly magnificent. Really great imagery. I love the emotion characters so much. It was really awesome to see a fictionalization of what goes on in someone's brain. It opened up a new realm of metaphors and imagination. This really made me think about what emotion is controlling my brain and all that. I'm not gonna spoil what it's about, but the plot is very effective. I absolutely love this movie, and Joy is now one of my favourite Disney characters. The animation is stunning, the movie is funny, the voice acting is great, the characters are great and... I cried 3 times during this movie. This was a powerful film with a great message. I give it 9.5/10 - A near perfection.

You'll laugh you'll cry.,"The theme of the Inside out is still growing. It sounds like an old and obsolete topic, but this time different, the story help us rediscover ourselves, our emotions, how are we holding the mood, why do we forget.The process of growth is no longer limited to Riley overcome various discomfort to face the new life, not limited to parents relieved from their own reality after realizing the child will eventually become independent of the will of the individuals. This growth is our new understanding of ourselves after the story.First, accept every mood.We are always eager joy rather than sadness, praise optimistic rather than negative. Social culture encourage us to be a human being that lively， outgoing, active and full of energy, however, not everybody is joy in midfield with a confident ""I can fix it"" against all odds.Most of the time, it is the negative emotions in our life give us strength: sadness makes us deeply, to learn and to experience, to increase the component of the life; fear enable us to plan ahead, driving a boat million years with fear; anger offer us a bottom line, to warn the enemies; disgust decide character, in case we follow suit and lost ourselves. Joy does make us better, but many times the blind optimism does not work. It likes meteors sweeping in a hurry, bright and brilliant, while what everlasting is deep and extensive dark in the sky.At the start maybe we all like pure Joy, don't make sense about the meaning of Sadness's existence and want to exclude her from the outside. However, it seems that life do not get perfect while lose the ability of feeling sad. There are many difficult moments in people's growth, even one thousand funny films don't make sense to get rid of them, but cry in a quiet corner works. So at last we will walk through the road of Joy, understand that it is Sadness lead us to the light, she is a part of our life.All kinds of moods shape us together. Accept them, then we can accept ourselves sincerely.Second, growth is accompanied by the losing.There are different roads for different body when we grow up, some come down in the world, some have a serious illness, some move from countryside to city. This is a process that no one can escape, childhood becomes the soap bubbles floating under sunshine in the moment we see the intricacies world of adult.This is not a growth film only for children，everyone suffered losing. the losing of the memory ball, the losing of personality island. However, losing is a necessary part cannot be separated from growth, it is a process mix up joy and sorrow.From simple to complex, from children to adult, and a faint ""adolescence"" at the end, Inside out is still a bright and brilliant story.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Over rated,"Nice but sometimes a bit boring and also slightly embarrassing in some places. It's not a bad movie, but it's slightly overrated from my point of view.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Cognitive-Emotional Adventure,"But not a fairy tale.The film's style is very much reminiscent of Wreck-It-Ralph which was probably inspired by adventure tales as old as time such as Anabasis or The Odyssey.That is to say, it's not such much a linear three-act structure as a wild journey through imaginative landscapes.It is important to help children learn to deal with their emotions, as Mr. Rogers stated was one of his most important goals in his address to congress to help save public television. In other words, this has been known for a long time but it was never discussed so directly or on such a grand scale as here. One of the most important principles of emotional control is detachment, which can be accomplished by visualizing internal phenomena as separate from oneself. In short, Disney chose an excellent topic to make a children's movie out of.As for the delivery, I'm afraid it's not very memorable. IT sort of meanders through a day in Riley's (the human vehicle the emotions are directing) life with sparse plot. It's not extremely clear why the emotions need to go on their grand adventure or the reason is so convoluted that it's lost on adult viewers, let alone children.The moral message is, sadly, not very aptly handled, either. All of the emotions other than joy seem to be incompetent fools, which means their very great importance to a person's life is only light implied or touched upon. The ultimate role of sadness - to elicit pity from others - was especially disappointing since it puts dependence on external support structures over self-acceptance.Disney is also moving the way of less prestigious animation houses and trying to appeal to every demographic by having distinct but separate strains of appeal - for example, there are adult jokes that will fly over children's heads and there's crazy frantic nonsensical action that will probably bore adults but entertain children. It's crass and lazy.Honourable Mentions: Alice in Wonderland (1951). One cannot help but compare Inside Out unfavourably to Disney's irrational adventure masterpiece. Alice goes through a parade of crazy scenes and characters that are very memorable to both old and young. The film has universal meaning as well that's mixed masterfully together without the need for frantic colourful scenes to appeal solely to children and crass relationship jokes to appeal only to adults.As a child, one cannot help but commiserate with Alice's frustration and find the crazy characters and their idiosyncracies entertaining. As an adult, this aspect is interesting, no doubt, but one also sees in these very same scenes a certain disheartening melancholia about what Wonderland's denizens reflect - the fantasy creatures are all obsessed with their ridiculous and inane personal ambitions and show cruel disregard for Alice's concerns or suffering - a very adroit parody of our actual society.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Emotional mess not masterpiece.,"It is good animation, and it has its moments, but it is just too unhealthy, unrealistic, and nonsensical in how the emotions interact, and in how they put together Riley's arc. The loss of memories just did not quite make sense. She may not view them the same, but she does not have Alzheimer's, so the crisis, and the tragic part of the movie lost a lot of their sting for me due to their relatively weak reasons for happening.

An emotional ride, a literal emotional ride which is as joy as it is sad to watch, which will show what anger and disgust feel like while carefully portraying fear, all in the mind of Riley, our protagonist or so we think because that's what the movie is trying to do, to make us think and think we will for there isn't another animated film more engaging in the genre of drama. Why do you sometimes feel lost? Why can't you sometimes anything? How are your feelings lost?

Don't turn your back on Pixar just yet.,"THE SHORT OF IT: While watching 'Inside Out', I came to the realization that the film contains common plot elements seen in past Pixar films (especially Docter's previous two films). If you've seen 'Monsters Inc.' and 'Up', then you'll eventually see that this film is just a rehash of those two films combined. However, some people say that Pixar's latest offering stole its concept from an obscure '90s sitcom called 'Herman's Head'. And some even say that this film is a complete rip-off of the 2009 Japanese manga 'Nounai Poison Berry' (and its live-action adaptation that also came out this year).For those people (and to myself), I just want to say one thing: deal with it. Like Picasso said, ""Good artists copy, great artists steal.""And Pixar did a great job stealing this idea and making it their own.With that being said, 'Inside Out' is still wildly original, universally relatable, and incredibly moving. The animation is beautiful as always, the story is well paced, and there are very few moments where the humour feels strange and off-putting (there's also a joke for you 'Chinatown' fans out there). Don't feel like you need to bring a little kid with you just to see this film – Pixar has proved time and time again in the past that they are some of Hollywood's best storytellers and has done so yet again with 'Inside Out'.This truly stands as one of the BEST 'coming-of-age (or puberty)' films that has been released in the past five years.P.S. Those with kids younger than nine should probably be warned that this film does get pretty dark (for a kid's movie) at the 2/3rd mark.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Yeah, the basic concept has been shown, but so has every concept. And it's not the concept that people are talking about being original; it's the moral. It was absolutely brilliant how they went about explaining a complex moral in a way that children can understand yet doesn't feel overly preachy either. It is a difficult balance to strike, and no matter how well you do it, someone will always dislike it. It shouldn't make me as angry as it does that so many people are misunderstanding this movie.

That's Why We Have Therapists,"It was a normal Saturday. I was rather upbeat and delighted to take the family to see Inside Out. Pixar usually does so well with their movies that I knew this would be another animated favorite. Well I didn't leave the theater as upbeat as I'd gone in. Inside Out was one of the more morose animations I've seen in a long time. I don't think I've been this down watching a Disney animation since Bambi's mother was killed.The premise of Inside Out was much like the 90's sitcom Herman's Head: emotions are represented in the head of the main character as individual characters. There was Joy, Sadness, Anger, Caution and Disgust. Joy was definitely the dominant character. She monopolized most of the emotional time, which is good, until something went awry. Then Riley, the main character whose head we were looking into, went from joyful to a state of depression and apathy, and not in a funny way. The movie hit a real somber and even dark note and stayed there for some time. Now, we're talking about a Disney movie so of course there was a happy ending but I don't think it was nearly happy enough to overcome the incredibly dampened mood that was cast over the movie. I remember quietly commenting that this girl needs a therapist.The movie had a good message and put a good spin on the need and meaning of our more negative emotions. Small parts of the movie went off the rails and I think that's because it was taking place inside someone's head. Anything is possible inside someone's mind and how do you graphically represent some of the things in a mind? It was a difficult story Pixar tried to tackle and they did OK.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It was a worthy award,"In Inside out we are introduced to a different idea about growing up, about life experiences, thereby producing a distinct movie. It's an animation which shows us about the routine of one child. It's about the childhood, but not only for kids. Because it reflects on our feelings and changes.
The main one character is Joy. She is the first feeling that Riley had when she was born. Since then, Joy controls the emotions and the memories of Riley. This is the reason of Joy's existence.
After the appearance of Joy, others secondary feelings share the mind of Riley - Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness. All they have their roles by decisions or actions of Riley, but by that time Joy always head the situations.
The journey of the story starts when Riley, that is now 11 years old, moves to another city and her comfortable routine, with her friends, habits, liking, are shattered. These changes have impacted her emotions. So, the characters of her feelings enter in conflict too.
Joy try administering the situation, but she needs to learn how to deal with Sadness, her counterpart.
Produced by Pixel and Disney, this movie won the Oscar of the best animation, and it was a worthy award. It's a singular and original story, dealing into humans emotions, displaying unique sensibility never seen before in a animation. It is a wonderful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
In the Top-Tier of Pixar's Already Stunning List of Features,"The buzz has been huge for Pixar's latest venture about the mind of a little girl and the emotions that live within her. Writer/directors Pete Docter and Ronaldo del Carmen, along with co-scribes Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley create a film with the most simple and authentic concept, and turns it into a methodical, moving, and layered story with so many different themes to indulge. Though there is a minor element to the film that leaves you a bit cold, ""Inside Out"" is clearly successful in its approach and just about everything you want in a family film this time of year.""Inside Out"" tells the story of Riley, an eleven-year-old girl whose family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. In her mind live five real, and relatable feelings: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. When Joy and Sadness accidentally are thrown into the land of Riley's long-term memories, Riley undergoes a barrage of emotions that are affecting her relationships with family, friends, and the things she loves. Now, Joy and Sadness must get back to her core command in order to restore Riley's feelings and relationships.Teamed with the voice talents of Amy Poehler ( who plays ""Joy""), Phyllis Smith (who plays ""Sadness""), Bill Hader (who plays ""Fear""), Lewis Black (who plays ""Anger""), and Mindy Kaling (who plays ""Disgust""), Pixar's joyful and moving animated feature presents equal parts of humor and tears. A fascinating deconstruction of the mind of a child, and the changes they endure along the way. The subject matter is among Pixar's most ambitious and their most impressive since ""WALL-E.""What shines bright is the stunning animation on screen. A beautiful array of colors, just hypnotizing to the eyes as ""Joy"" and ""Sadness"" venture off into different parts of Riley's mind. I'd say this is definitely among Pixar's most alluring and aesthetically beautiful films they've ever created.As we've come to expect from an Oscar-winning composer like Michael Giacchino, the score for ""Inside Out"" is subtly impeccable. Among his most reserved compositions, Giacchino takes a back seat to the story and lets the film do its work through imagery and narration.Presenting another key reason for a Voice Work Oscar to be created, both Poehler and Smith are downright magnificent in two of the year's finest performances. Poehler's Joy anchors the film with a glaze of sweetness, and when called upon, will break your heart with epic emotions. Smith's Sadness is a devastating but truly compelling creation, as she bridges our thoughts through tears and loss. Those two will be putting your tearducts to work and in overdrive in several moments. This is another shining example of a female-driven feature that is just as enjoyable, if not more, than any other male protagonist in films today. Film producers need to start taking notice of the slate of successes this year and what they need to do change the landscape.Where the film doesn't completely connect is in its supporting characters, in particular Anger and Disgust. With no fault going to the sensational voice work of Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling, the narrative creation of their place in the story doesn't seem to quite jive. ""Anger"" is a simple emotion to portray, but I minor found inconsistencies in his character's actions that were noticeable. ""Disgust,"" which probably would have been better off being called ""Sarcasm"" just didn't seem like a core emotion that I think exists in the mind of an eleven year old girl. While I think ""Disgust"" is something that the younger minds can easily understand, I think a different direction may have been needed for her inclusion. Other players like Bill Hader, Diane Lane (who plays Mom), and Kyle MacLachlan (who plays Dad) are strongly assembled. Special shout out to Kaitlyn Dias, who voices Riley, is vivaciously real in each delivery and each line.With no shortage of tears for the adults, and big laughs for the kids, ""Inside Out"" fits firmly in the top-tier of Pixar's most vibrant pictures. An echo of love and vulnerability, the feature is gorgeously inventive and passionately executed. A fine selection for all to enjoy, no matter what age. Your frontrunner for the Animated Feature Oscar for 2015 has arrived.In addition, the Pixar short ""Lava"" is stunningly delightful and powerfully engaging. Likely another contender for an Animated Short Academy Award.Read more @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A psychological freak show--wholly inappropriate for children!,"What in the hell was that! More importantly, what has happened to Disney!

Deserves its place with other Pixar classics...,"It's tempting to name the Oscar winner in Animated Feature Film for this year (2015) already, because Inside Out is going to be tough to beat! From the same writer/director, Pete Docter of Pixar classics such as Toy Story (all of them), Monster's Inc, and Up, Inside Out figured to be another great one and surely delivered. The story is of a girl named Riley who's emotions help guide her from birth to the point at which her life is uprooted by a move away from her home town. Those emotions - joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger - are terrifically voiced by the likes of Amy Poehler (SNL), Phyllis Smith (The Office), Bill Hader (SNL), Mindy Kaling (The Office), and Lewis Black (Stand-up comic). The animation is glorious, and I feel like I need to see this movie a half dozen more times to be able to take it all in. Add to that an interesting and convincingly complex story line that conceptualizes memories, dreams, the sub conscience, and such in very clever ways. I think the story itself is too complicated for a younger audience, but like many Pixar films, part of the magic is being able to entertain audiences of all levels, even when the story is geared for a more mature audience (think WALL-E, which Pete Docter also wrote). This film doesn't quite have the emotional impact or laughs of a Monster's, Inc., or Toy Story 3 (my personal favorite), but it surely has its tender moments with plenty of funny stuff. That, along with a lively, clever plot and eye candy galore, makes Inside Out a definite must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Intensely Emotional Magic,"I was in a packed screening of Inside Out at the Birmingham Everyman cinema on Saturday, consisting almost entirely of adults. Absolutely incredible movie and an early contender for the best picture Oscar. Can't remember the last time a film completely dazzled me like that.It was overwhelmingly brilliant from the outset and the short 'Lava' set the tone beautifully. I feel as though Pixar have pushed boundaries here in terms of revolutionising the target demographic of animated films. It almost felt that this was a film aimed at adults with lots of winks for the kids rather than vice versa.I like the way Pixar have scaled down the plot to something we've all seen before; kid moves to new place and find it tough to adjust, nothing new here. Yet Pixar managed to use this simple story arc to run havoc with their imaginations as to what happens within ones self at a time like this.Hats off to Pixar for creating this stunning, intensely emotional family film.

"You will admire the creativity, worth to watch comedy cartoon","I do not regularly watch animation movies, but since I saw the highly positive reviews, I went to watch it, and liked the movie. The overall idea of the movie has a lot, i mean A LOT, of creativity that you will definitely admire. A point that I like about this movie is it avoids falling into a category of ""just amaze the audience"" movies. There is some meaning in many parts of the movie that is open to discussion. In my opinion, this movie is in many ways similar to the ""up"" movie, made by the same company. However, I think ""up"" was better made.Overall, worth to watch if you are interested in animations.

Pixar's Most Emotional Movie Yet,"If there's anything that can be said about this film, it's that it's by far Pixar's most emotional movie to date. Hehehehe...sorry, couldn't resist. But really, I spent an alarming amount of time with a lump in my throat. However, while Pixar's latest film is a fascinating thought experiment, it definitely has its flaws.It's a little bit difficult to decide whether the emotion lies in the movie or in the memories it evokes. I'd imagine it's a completely different experience for a child viewer, a teenager, or a parent, but I suspect the last two appreciate its full weight far more than young children would. It's not that kids won't like the film: to the contrary, it feels like it's designed for younger viewers, unlike Ratatouille or The Incredibles (my two favorite Pixar films.) It's merely that this story is more about the loss of childhood than the celebration of it. This bittersweet feel is similar to that in Toy Story 3.The story is about Riley, an eleven-year-old whose young life has been blissfully happy up until the day her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. She had tons of friends, doting parents, a successful hockey career, a never-ending chain of happy memories, symbolized by glowing marbles.These memories are fashioned by her five emotions: Joy (an enthusiastic Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Fear (Bill Hader), and Anger (Lewis Black.) Up until this point, Joy has had complete control, but glimpses into the minds of Riley's parents - where Sadness and Anger are the primary fueling emotions - foreshadow that things may be about to change. Joy recognizes the place of Fear, Disgust, and Anger - they keep Riley safe. But Sadness, that most adult of emotions, seems to have no function whatsoever. In a more typical movie, Sadness would have been cast as the villain. But this isn't a typical movie.Once Riley arrives in San Francisco, all of her happiness comes into question. We follow her through the events of the move, her first day at school and trying out for the hockey team. Inside of her head, something has gone terribly wrong, and the emotions have to work double time to get things right. It's clever how the movie uses the emotions - you can almost fool yourself into thinking that what happens to Riley is a consequence of what they do, but in the end, you know that they are an allegory for her mind, not the other way around. But the emotions don't know what the viewer knows must happen: they expect childhood to continue forever, and memories to remain simply happy or sad or angry or fearful or disgusting.The rest of the movie takes place over the space of a few days, as Riley's emotional life crumbles and she has to redefine herself. Looking back, the whole thing is not all that huge a crisis, but it's magnified by the drama of her emotions. It reminds me of Lord of the Flies (bear with me) in that the film does a great job of getting us into a child's head. It's surprising to look back and, like returning to a childhood home as an adult, realize how small everything was, after all.Childhood is a complicated thing. We see Riley's happiness, but also her immaturity. In the end - and here's kind of a spoiler - the resolution comes through growing up, not embracing childhood. Sadness can lead us just as sensibly as Joy, and perhaps even the other emotions - in their proper place - have a role in engaging the world wisely. Being happy isn't the most important thing.I'm not as impressed with the film as some. It's good, but not amazing. I wasn't a huge fan of the over-colorful milieu it embraces in its Inside sequences - it felt too much like other bright children's films I've seen, and lessened the impact of the dark Outside. I didn't find the idea as original as other did, either (I'll admit, I was thinking of Osmosis Jones, a film which is probably really terrible, but the last time I saw it I was six.)There was too much of a focus on preschool imagery for an eleven-year- old - by that age I was obsessed with dragons and pirates, rather than clowns and pink elephants. Because one could see the direction of the allegory, the story could be predictable, and I could foretell events some time before they actually happened.On the other hand, Inside Out has tons of strengths. It's the most original Pixar film since Up, and Riley's family is the best Pixar family since The Incredibles. The emotions are terrifically voiced and animated - my personal favorite is Phyllis Smith's sullen, melodramatic Sadness, but Poehler is wonderful as ebullient Joy. They're Pixar's first female duo - follow-ups to Mike and Sully and Buzz and Woody.The filmmakers have a ton of fun with Riley's mind - I especially loved the dream sets, sub-conscious, and Imaginary Boyfriend. It's really very funny - at moments, I defied the silent theater to guffaw uproariously at subtle jokes. (Or the not-subtle ones: ""GIRL - GIRL - GIRL."")Ultimately, I think the biggest compliment I can give to the movie is that (no pun intended) it got inside my head. I'm still young enough to vividly remember the confused emotions and insecurity of adolescence. These days, I often have opportunities to reflect on what my sixteen-year-old self would make of the things I'm doing now. Watching old family videos with horror just last week, I realized I have almost nothing in common with eleven-year-old Hannah. And what a complete idiot she was. And how happy she was in her idiocy! Dangit, Pixar. Inside Out is going to keep me thinking about those things for some time to come.Originally posted here: http://goo.gl/0URBvh",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

There are so many different aspects and depths to this movie! It speaks volumes! Go see it today, you won't be disappointed!

My Favorite Film From 2015,"Sometimes there comes along an excellent, well made, and masterful film that everybody loves, but, for some weird reason, all of the most popular user reviews are negative. Now, I don't mind people expressing their honest opinion, but I don't get some of the user reviews that have been posted, and I ESPECIALLY don't get why there's so many people giving it a 1/10! Sure, you can hate the movie, TOTALLY fine, but a 1/10 star rating is totally unnecessary when you have a film with such lovely animation, and so much hard work and effort clearly put into it! It really bothers me when I go through some of these reviews because I know that animation and filmmaking are extremely hard, and this isn't some lazily animated, 50 minute rip off of ""Kung Fu Panda"" (I'm looking at you, ""The Little Panda Fighter""), this is a pretty well made film. I guess this just proves that opinions are truly powerful things, but, anyway, what about the actual movie!I already said before, it is an extremely well put together animated film, full of great details and the amount of hard work and effort that was clearly put into this production is absolutely amazing! Even if you weren't 100% into the story, characters, etc., it's very well made, at least, just like any other Pixar or Disney animated film.While the concept of seeing the inside of a character's head and watching their emotions react to various things is nothing new and can be seen in various TV shows, movies, etc. (There's even an entire sitcom based around the idea called ""Herman's Head""), this film really expands upon the concept and looks at some of the tiniest details in a really clever and witty way. For example, there's one scene in which we are briefly introduced to two characters whose jobs are to take certain, unimportant memories and make the brain forget about them forever. That is only one example out of many examples of true cleverness behind ""Inside Out"".And the film isn't just fun and games, it has a truly emotional and surprisingly mature side to it that's likely to make plenty of viewers cry. Trust me, ""Inside Out"" goes to some really dark and borderline depressing places!This truly is a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Inventive, Engaging, and Funny, Inside Out has the Peak-Pixar Flavor We Haven't Seen in Years","20 years in the film business, Pixar has given us masterpiece after masterpiece even if its best days are probably behind them. They know how to toy with your emotions, add depth to their characters, and best of all know how to deliver very unique stories in very unique perspectives. Director Pete Doctor's previous movie Up is a grandiose example of being an excellent film despite being far off the norm. Inside Out is no exception as it tackles a very complicated yet creative concept of exploring the emotions of a person while giving personalities to emotions---which is no easy task.Inside Out being made into a feasible family movie is quite the accomplishment. Even if the deeper emotional moments and better jokes will be lost on the children, this film has something for everybody to see, from the visuals to the creative stylings of the human mind. Combine that with the perfect (Its honestly flawless) voice cast and a well-rounded script, you have Pixar's best since Toy Story 3.Joy (The perfect Amy Poehler) leads the cast as she attempts to dominate the mind of an 11-year-old and keep the other emotions (Anger, Disgust, Fear, and especially Sadness) in check---especially once the family relocates across the entire country. The conflict arises once Joy becomes unable to run Riley's emotions, leading to a lot of problems inside the mind and outside. Although Pixar runs in the Disney family and you secretly know how it will all pan out, the adventure and discoveries leading up to the inevitable conclusion is what keeps you engaged. There will be the classic Pixar mix of laughter, tears, and surprises throughout the quest to save Riley.Establishing the universe is essential in movies like these, where environments carry its distinctive logic, its distinctive gravity. Inside Out starts out slow so it can mesh out the characters and give us a good idea as to how to approach the world of the mind. By the time you reach the dramatic conclusion, you would have witnessed Riley's imaginative world, her abstract world, her dream machine, as well as her biggest fears. The journey is far from predictable, as Inside Out explores a concept rarely executed (save for a 90s cartoon and a hilarious Spongebob bit).Pixar has had a rough run lately, with delays and disappointing movies mixing together this decade. Inside Out is a step in the right direction thanks to a great script, delightful originality, and the great mix of great animation, laughs and heartfelt moments that we last experienced in the epic Pixar run of 2007-2010 (Ratatouille, Up, Wall-E, Toy Story 3, etc.). It might be slower or more bizarre then what you are used to seeing in animation and blockbuster season, but this film is a fresh visual treat from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A beautiful, touching and insightful film","Inside Out takes us inside the mind of a young girl as she grows up and goes through various changes and emotions. It's humorous, moving and thought-provoking. The concept is simple and a bit arbitrary - that our minds consist of 5 primary emotions that take turns directing our actions. But this idea is really just a starting point for countless observations about the many subtleties of human emotion.The movie is ripe for deeper interpretations. I feel like anyone learning psychology could draw upon so many helpful analogies via this film. The way we store old memories, forget things, remember random things, alternate quickly between different emotions, change as we grow up, develop moral values, etc. Inside Out visualises these things in ways which are often funny but also abstractly seem to make perfect sense.There are many parallels to another masterpiece, Inception. Both films delve into the inner workings of the human mind. The ideas they present are deeply original and profound. They have universal relevance because the scene of the action is perhaps the only thing absolutely everyone has in common (a mind of course). In fact, it's a concept we often seem to forget or skim over. That great mystery of who we are, what we are, what exactly are thoughts and feelings and what defines who we truly are? Do we love ourselves? Do we even know ourselves? Modern society seems to focus exclusively on the external world, forgetting that we ""exist"" and carry a world within our own minds. In both movies, our hero confronts something within themselves and grows as a result.Monster's, Inc. was full of jokes specific to the world it had created and so is Inside Out. The writers clearly had fun adding all the little details. I'm confident that Inside Out will only grow in comedic value with each viewing. The characters are true to themselves and the movie never stops for the sake of a gag. The comedy naturally flows out of what's happening.I was deeply moved by this movie. Its story is far more tragic and deeply sad than the colours and humour make it seem. It's about a child's world gradually falling apart. And yet somewhere in her subconscious, she desperately tries to find happiness again. It strips humanity down to its most basic level. Our truest, most personal feelings that we are sometimes afraid to acknowledge or accept. Everyone has felt what she feels. And any adult will understand the frightening possibilities that are alluded to and how differently things could have turned out.I feel I've learned new things about life and human emotions. Sometimes the distinction between happiness and sadness can become blurred. We can't always have control of our emotions (but perhaps we can choose how to handle them). The way we feel about the past can change unexpectedly. Healing can sometimes be scary and painful but worth it. It may be better to accept how we feel than to act tough and become something we're not. We're usually more loved than we realise. Our experiences can shape who we are. Often when we grow, we lose things but gain richer things. We can create a moment of joy out of an unpleasant situation. People often walk away from things with completely different ideas of what just happened. These might not all be amazing revelations, but they are presented here so poetically that your perspective is refreshed.The film-making is of such a high calibre that the entire focus is on the story and the experience. I don't want to write about the voice-acting or animation or effects or script or music because I didn't notice any of it. But I guess that really just means they were all excellent. I never had a chance to complain because I was completely engaged. We see what we're meant to see and feel what we're meant to feel. Pixar appears to be full of talented and passionate film-makers and it shows with all of their movies. Inside Out pulls at our heartstrings and opens our eyes like it's no big deal. This is a true work of art worthy of admiration and wholehearted enjoyment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
movie misses the most important point entirely!,"All that money spent to make it and the movie misses the most important point entirely! The most important human emotion is LOVE, not the other ones that play key roles in the movie. And it is LOVE, Mr. Pete Docter, not LAVA, but I guess it is pointless to explain what LOVE is to someone who does not put much value on it.I did not know that children are supposed to scream at parents or throw temper tantrum, or do other crazy things the girl in the movie did when she did not like what her parents did. But according to Pete Docter it is perfectly OK and only natural for a 10 year old to do. Slamming doors in parent's face is OK. Giving them silent treatment is OK, too, according to the directors. But what is really bad, according to the movie, is a healthy veggie pizza! What is really Inside Out is the director's understanding of values and what is good and what is bad.Trust me - your child will get a lot of wrong ideas after watching this piece of junk.

Pixar is back!,"In the past few years, I'm not gonna lie, Pixar Studios have had some duds. They became far too comfortable on the sequel train that didn't require boundary pushing creative storytelling to make millions. Monsters University was a sore disappointment and don't even get me started on Cars 2. Now, they've finally decided to get off that train and return to their roots in telling incredibly clever and beautifully original stories, and they're quickly being reminded that this train makes lots of money, too. Inside Out takes us back to the Pixar heyday of films like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, and The Incredibles and reminds us why we fell in love with this studio, and why adults and children alike can enjoy the hell out of an animated movie made ""for kids.""Pixar has always been playing with the idea of giving emotions to different creatures (toys, bugs, fish, etc.) and now they've gone Inception on us and given feelings to FEELINGS. Inside Out is the ultimate personification of what goes on in a person's head as they think and feel different things, having their decisions and actions fueled by the multitude of emotions swirling about in their brain. And by multitude I mean five because that's a workable amount of characters and voice actors to fill the core of your story.Inside Out follows Riley, a girl from Minnesota who moves to San Francisco with her family. Inside her head lives Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Anger. These five personified emotions work together to keep Riley's mind in check in an elaborate and infinitely clever world full of personality islands, thought trains, imaginary friends lost in long term memory, and so many other brilliant representations of abstract concepts that exist in the human brain. Pixar has always had a knack for high concept world building, and they've outdone themselves here.If you want a totally immersive experience within a world that is abstractly absurd yet also feels so real, then go see this movie. Inside Out builds a world and a system that is full of all the fantastical elements you would expect from an animated experience like this, but it is executed so well and the way thoughts and feelings are represented hits so close to home that after the movie you'll find yourself imagining what your little feeling characters are like in your own head. You'll find yourself thinking about what your own core memories are and what islands of personality they power. Inside Out represents growing up in a way we've never seen done before. It is a perfect way of making sense of all the different emotions we experience as we grow up and learn more about the world. I promise that you've never seen a coming of age story like this. I honestly don't know if I've ever experienced an animated film of this caliber that, while so fantastical and so extravagant, also feels so real.The human brain is nothing more than billions and trillions of electrical synapses, but sometimes those synapses can create something beautiful, like this incredible personification of the mind that is adorable, funny, sentimental, and powerfully touching. I'm so thankful for the synapses working in the minds of those geniuses over at Pixar, because it has given us one of the most heartwarming films in a long, long time that is so universally relate-able I don't know how anybody couldn't enjoy it. I suppose if your Joy emotion were trapped somewhere in the halls of Long Term Memory that might be one way you wouldn't enjoy Inside Out, but hopefully she can catch the next Thought Train back to emotion headquarters soon. Yes, I believe I will be explaining mine and all other emotions through personified characters voiced by Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, and Lewis Black for a while now.

After she is uprooted from her life in Minnesota and moves to San Francisco following her father's announcement of his new job, Riley's emotions begin to conflict as she tries to control her emotions and navigate life at a new house, new school, and new friends. Likewise, an accident inside Headquarters causes great difficulty and Joy and Sadness to be sucked out, so they must team up to find all of Riley's memories and return home before it is too late.Directed by Pete Docter (""Monsters, Inc.,"" ""Up""), this film could be considered a return to form for Pixar following the mostly lukewarm or decent reception of their previous films, including ""Cars 2"" and ""Monsters University."" While not overtly original, the way the concept is handled is what makes the movie so unique. As every emotion is one part of the total personality, so too are their characterizations and character design. Even the level of detail on the animation is noteworthy, such as the energy particles the emotions sometimes leave behind or the realistic facial effects of newborn Riley. The same can also be said of the visual design, with bright and vivid colors remaining prominent inside Riley's mind. Clever visual motifs include the Long-Term Memory resembling a large cerebral cortex, Imagination Land with its french-fry forest, and the backlot of Dream Productions, where dreams are filmed.In addition, each cast member perfectly suits their animated counterparts, with Amy Poehler providing the necessary exuberance for Joy and Lewis Black in the all too fitting role of the irascible Anger. Phyllis Smith, Bill Hader, and Mindy Kaling round out the rest of the lead cast, portraying Sadness, Fear, and Disgust. Perhaps the most interesting character is Bing-Bong, who used to exist as Riley's imaginary friend when she was younger, and has the the tail of a cat, face and trunk of an elephant, and the lower-half of a cotton candy stick. He provides an extra dose of humor and character throughout.The story is neatly-structured in a way that doesn't leave any part of it feeling rushed. The quality of the animation, as is typical of Pixar, is superb. Some standout moments of humor in ""Inside Out"" include a running gag containing the memory of a gum commercial, the filming of the re-enactment of the first day of school by Dream Productions using their ""reality distortion filter,"" and a sequence visually depicting abstract thought, where the characters briefly become abstract shapes themselves and gradually turn into flat, two-dimensional lines.""Inside Out"" reminds us of the excitement, suspense, and most importantly, joy we feel when going to the movies.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Almost Perfect - 9.2,"Inside Out takes place into Riley's emotions and show us what happens inside your head when you have sort of crisis. Or in this case - moving to a new city.On the one hand,the movie has a lot of tiny problems that ruins the chance to give it a 10. For example, there were few times that i was bored or already know what is coming next. And I wasn't the only one. Also my cousins who are much younger than me felt like this. This shouldn't happen if the movie's goal is to be perfect!Another great example is that in my opinion they didn't focus enough about the emotions and how they function in a different situation-before Riley moved to a new city and the twist started. I wanted to see a lot more about Riley's life and friends.On the other hand, this film is fantastic by many aspects, the movie built a new interesting world that i was very curios and interested to learn about.Also,the movie succeed to make the audiences feel connected to the characters and off-course almost all of the movie had an interesting plot.In conclusion,the movie has a few little problems that ruins the chance to give it a 10 But also a lot of amazement,funny and sophisticated scenes that you suddenly almost forget about the issues that you had with the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
OK i guess,"The animation is nice and is an interesting take on how the mind works in an upbeat and humorous way. The plot, however, is decent I guess, quite a bit of hole here and there. Din't make as much as a emotional impact on me, since it's probably more meant for a younger audience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Well made, but just too depressing","I like this movie, but, I just can't watch it anymore. The more I watch it, the more I realize that it's just too incredibly sad and depressing, and the music on top of that makes me want to die. It's too awful. The whole combination of it all just makes for a garbage film. At least Frozen was fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Cried like a baby,"I am a 20 years old girl going through a break up. I decided to cut contact with my ex love interest a month ago when I founded out that he was cheating on me. Since then, I kept myself extremely busy with work (I'm a waitress so I'm doing a pretty demanding physical work every day: 10 to 20 km of walking through the restaurant). I get along mostly well with my coworkers, it's not my dream job but it's something temporary that I enjoy for keeping me busy and making some money.Because I don't really have free time to think about my ex I just enjoy the present moment, or at least I am trying to. During the day I am pretty goofy and make people laugh a lot. When it's a stressful atmosphere I either use humor to make my colleagues laugh or I just keep my emotions for myself.In the last weeks, I started drinking every night a few glasses of rum. It helps me fall asleep easier and the music sounds better. However I started feeling dissociated of my body, I cannot connect with anyone and I cannot empathize with what others are feeling. After a long day of being nice to everyone I just want to watch a movie, drink alcohol and eat a lot of unhealthy food. I don't have any hope for the future and I find it hard to imagine that I will every be able to feel happiness again, especially if I will see my ex. I don't know if I can be honest with him if we ever talk again because I'm afraid I will have my feelings invalidated. I am just too scared and anxious.Today I watched this movie and the first time I started crying like a baby was when Sadness listened to Bing Bong's feelings. After that scene I kept crying during the movie. I didn't cry like that in a lot of time and I really missed it. It felt amazing. Definitely a movie to enjoy when you are going through hard stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another Pixar Classic,"Do you ever look at someone and wonder, ""What is going on inside their head?"" Well, the reality is the answers pretty dull. It's just a big brain sending messages across your body to determine your actions. But in the minds of the creators at Pixar the answer has no limits, with every persons head containing a fully functioning world, where small beings create and store every idea and memory we have in life. And at the centre of this world is a control panel, similar to something like the deck of the Enterprise, which is controlled by our emotions that lead us through every decision we make in our lives.Inside Out follows a girl named Riley (Katilyn Dias) and the five emotions that lead her every action- Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Riley's most important emotion that has shaped all of Riley's core memories that make her the person she is, Joy (Amy Pohler). They all care for Riley and one another like one big family, always looking to give Riley the best life she can have. This includes everything from remembering to avoid Broccoli to maintaining Riley's goofy attitude to remain her parents happy little girl.But Riley is entering a difficult period in her life of great change. She is moving to a new home in San Francisco, leaving her friends behind, and her father has become too busy with work to look after her the way he used to. This causes the emotions to conflict on the best way to deal with it, with the ensuing chaos causing Joy and Sadness to get lost in the furthest reaches of Riley's mind and forcing them to go on a journey to return to the control room, or Riley might never be happy again.In some ways the film is a nice reminder of how even after 20 years, Pixar has stuck to what made them so engaging to audiences to begin with. The journey that Joy and Sadness go on is a great buddy travel movie, that's in a similar vein to Buzz and Woody in 'Toy Story'. And just like 'Toy Story', Pixar has continued to remain focused on developing memorable characters that will help shape many childhoods, with the likes of Joy's energetic personality and simplistic but lovable design bound to stick in our heads the same way that Buzz Lightyear did when 'Toy Story' was first released.But in other ways the film is a reminder to show how far both Pixar and CGI animation has come, with the worlds Pixar's movies take place in going from the constraints of a child's bedroom to creating an entire world within the mind of a child. And the world that they create is something truly special. Other films have taken place in a person's mind in the past with their own distinct styles, from the epic mind bending action of 'Inception' to the fragmenting chaos in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind'. But no other film has ever approached the inner workings of a mind with the same creativity as Pixar has.The film includes as much as it could of developing how a mind works and what an 11 year old girl would be thinking about, incorporating it as either a great gag or as a way the world is designed to function. There's a literal train of thought that's able to carry memories across Riley's mind, a place called Déjà vu that keeps popping up, and even a dream centre that operates like a movie studio to give Riley something to watch at night. Even small sayings like getting a song stuck in your head are incorporated in to the film in some of Pixars funniest running gags to date. Plus I'm relatively certain that anyone who's seen the film will be humming Triple Dent Gum for the rest of their lives.As always, at the films heart remains the human drama that has kept Pixar movies so relatable over the years. In one of the most touching scenes, we watch as Joy turns on one of Riley's treasured childhood memories of her skating to pick up her spirits and slowly begins to skate with her in perfect synch. It's a beautiful moment where we're shown both the close bond that Riley and her emotions share, whilst reminding us all on the way we all hold on to out childhood in a way that only Pixar can.It's moments like this that can be universally related to, mixed with Pixar's stunning animation and their ability to create such original worlds that ensures Inside Out is another addition to Pixar's constantly growing collection of treasured classics.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Emotions Unleashed: A Journey Through the Mind in 'Inside Out',"In the realm of animated films, few dare to venture beyond the surface of entertainment to explore the intricate labyrinth of the human psyche. ""Inside Out,"" directed by Pete Docter and Ronnie del Carmen, is a film that not only ventures but soars into this uncharted territory with a vibrancy that is as rare as it is delightful.The film introduces us to Riley, an 11-year-old girl who becomes the landscape upon which a daring narrative unfolds. The true protagonists, however, are her emotions: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, who reside in the command center of her mind, steering her through the tumultuous journey of life. It's a premise that could easily spiral into chaos, yet ""Inside Out"" handles it with a deft touch that is both ingenious and tender.The animation is a visual feast, a kaleidoscope of colors that brings to life the world inside Riley's head with such detail and imagination that one cannot help but be drawn in. The character design is equally impressive, with each emotion perfectly encapsulating their essence in a way that is instantly recognizable and relatable. The voice acting is top-notch, with Amy Poehler's Joy and Phyllis Smith's Sadness standing out for their ability to convey a wide range of feelings that resonate with both young and old.The narrative is where ""Inside Out"" truly shines. It is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving together humor, pathos, and adventure in a tapestry that is as thought-provoking as it is heartwarming. The film tackles complex themes such as the importance of embracing all emotions, the bittersweet nature of growing up, and the realization that memories, whether joyful or sorrowful, shape who we are. It does so with a sophistication that never feels preachy or didactic, but rather, invites the audience to reflect on their own inner workings.""Inside Out,"" for all its emotional intelligence, occasionally succumbs to the pitfalls of its ambition. The pacing, while mostly brisk, sometimes lags, particularly in the second act where the journey through the labyrinth of Riley's mind feels a tad prolonged. The film also introduces a multitude of ideas and concepts that, while fascinating, are not always fully fleshed out, leaving one yearning for a deeper exploration of this rich inner world.The film's attempt to personify the abstract workings of the mind, though innovative, can at times feel oversimplified. The complexities of human emotions are reduced to caricatures that, while effective for storytelling purposes, do not fully encapsulate the nuances of our psychological makeup. This simplification is a double-edged sword, making the film accessible to children but perhaps too on-the-nose for more discerning adult viewers.""Inside Out"" is a bold and beautiful foray into the landscape of emotions that sets a new standard for what animated films can achieve. It is a film that dares to ask profound questions about the nature of happiness, sadness, and the myriad emotions in between. While it may not delve as deep as one might wish, it provides a springboard for discussions that are seldom prompted by a family film. It is a remarkable achievement that stands as a testament to the power of animation to not only entertain but to enlighten and inspire. In a world where cynicism often reigns supreme, ""Inside Out"" is a beacon of hope, reminding us that every emotion has its place, and that together, they make us whole.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Super original and entertaining,"Inside Out stands as a remarkable triumph in the realm of animated storytelling, skillfully weaving together a narrative that transcends age boundaries. Pixar, in collaboration with Disney, ventures into the depths of the human mind, crafting a vivid and emotionally resonant exploration of the complexities that shape our inner world.At the film's core are the anthropomorphized emotions: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger, each brought to life with vibrant personalities and distinct characteristics. This ingenious concept not only entertains but also serves as a metaphorical journey through the intricate landscape of our emotions. The personification of these feelings allows the audience to connect with the characters on a profound level, fostering empathy and understanding.Visually, it is a feast for the eyes. The animation is a testament to Pixar's mastery, with each frame meticulously crafted to capture the essence of the emotions and the fantastical world inside the mind. The vibrant hues of Joy's exuberance contrast with the subdued tones of Sadness, creating a visually stunning dichotomy that mirrors the ebb and flow of human emotions.What sets this film apart is its ability to tackle complex psychological concepts in a way that is accessible to audiences of all ages. The narrative gracefully navigates the challenges of growing up, addressing the inevitability of change and the importance of embracing the full spectrum of emotions. It serves as a valuable tool for both children and adults, fostering conversations about mental health and emotional well-being.At its emotional core, this one is a celebration of the necessity of sadness in the human experience. The film skillfully challenges the societal inclination to prioritize happiness over all other emotions, emphasizing that each feeling plays a crucial role in shaping our identities and experiences. This nuanced approach to emotional intelligence sets a new standard in animated storytelling, encouraging viewers to embrace and appreciate the intricacies of their own emotional landscapes.The voice cast, led by Amy Poehler as Joy and Phyllis Smith as Sadness, delivers stellar performances that breathe life into these animated embodiments of emotion. The chemistry among the cast members enhances the narrative, creating a dynamic ensemble that guides the audience through the highs and lows of the story.The movie is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of animation. Its rich tapestry of emotions, coupled with stunning animation and a thought-provoking narrative, elevates it to a status of enduring brilliance. A film that not only entertains but also enlightens, stands as a testament to the power of storytelling in fostering empathy, understanding, and appreciation for the beautifully complex human experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Brings out deep meanings of life and brilliant animation,"For those people who think this movie is depressing and sad, yea it kinda is but it also brings out the deep meaning of life - sometimes it's okay to cry out and be sad, you don't have to pretend to be happy and positive and keep everything to yourself. I cried so hard when Riley cried and when Joy finally understands how important Sadness is, Inside Out is one of my favourite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Inside Out,"Generally a perfectly fine Pixar installment, but didn't tickle me as much as many of their other Pixar movies do. The concept is fantastic, going into people minds and characterizing their emotions literally. But what felt lacking was it's world, music and character design.Directing was fine but didn't really up the ante much compared to others, visually it's pretty, but it rarely goes beyond that and becomes magical. Character design is also an aspect I though that was a bit more generic than I'd like to see. Anger being the most distinctive but others could have blended in emotion and still worked.The world is grounded and based in reality (the real one) and it looks the part. Fairly bleak but also somewhat generic Pixar. That aside it manages to make the family feel more grounded too which was good. The fantasy emotional world was aside from the core memory balls not as interesting as I'd hoped.Regarding this movie being too ''dark'' I guess in comparison it takes a bit longer to showcase the negative emotions, but it didn't feel like too much to me. Bing bong moment and the family moment were great signature Pixar tearjerkers. I can't believe I cried over a pink elephant alien thing.Music is a big part of what makes a Pixar movie for me and it felt incredibly lacking here, it's good, but it always felt like something in the background. It didn't play a big part and never stuck with me. Even writing this review right after watching I couldn't remember the tune for this movie.All in all fine, but not as exciting and magical as the Pixar movies I love.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A return to form for Pixar.,"This movie was a hard sell. I liked the first sneak peek of the preview of this film, but I wasn't really feeling the other trailers and the marketing campaign overall. But to it's credit this movie is a hard movie to sell without spoiling anything.I really enjoyed this film. I think Pixar found their groove back with Inside Out after misfires like Brave and the Cars franchise. But with that being said, what Pixar is great at is making movies, not just for kids, but for adults as well. The exterior of the films seem like for kids, but the interior has many layers and depth.This film allows you to feel the emotions you see on screen, who are the emotions of a girl named Riley(Kaitlyn Dias). The whole cast is stellar, Joy voiced by Amy Poehler carries this film, I was very concerned if I can get on board with a character who is happy all the time throughout the whole film, but Poehler and her character manages to do so. Phyllis Smith is Sadness and she is terrific, I found her to be a tad annoying in the beginning, but she won me over. I liked the other supporting emotions, Mindy Kaling provides sassiness as Disgust and Lewis Black as Anger provides some humorous moments as well, but my favorite out of all is Bill Hader's Fear. He was great. The parents portrayed by Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan provide decent supporting roles.How the creative minds of Pixar came up with this conceptually complicated film is beyond me. Give director/writer Pete Docter, who also wrote Wall-E and Up, credit where credit is due. The story is almost perfectly constructed. I say almost, because the beginning starts off so well and it's thrilling, just to see the concept become realized in just a few minutes kicked the film off in high gear. What bogged the story down a little is when Joy and Sadness end up getting lost within the large maze of Riley's brain/memory trying to get back into the control room. That is where the film looses some momentum. I didn't particularly love Richard Kind's Bing Bong, but he was my least favorite character of the bunch, but he is used very effectively, and to those who saw it, you know what I'm talking about. It's just a tiny nitpick but I just wish they allowed the idea to carry the film itself rather than have this middle act, again it wasn't a huge detriment, just a nitpick as it eventually picks up steam again.This is Pixar's most ambitious and most subtly intelligent film yet. Not since Toy Story 3 have I enjoyed a film this much by them. Again, I'm going to sound like a broken record, but Pixar really knows how to tell a story. Yes they do have some misfires, but their track record is solid. I'm not the target demographic for these films, but they continue to turn up solid, dependable, and consistent entertainment.This film hits the right notes on another level. The conceptual level this film operates on is a pleasure to watch on screen. This movie is very thought-provoking and is filled with awesome and clever metaphors that never gets complicated at all. It explains emotional states very well disguised as a kid's film and sends a great message that not just that everyone has emotions, but it cannot be one emotion all the time and every time, and each emotion has it's place. It's an easy film to relate to, and to be honest I sincerely believe that adults might enjoy this film a little more than kids. Inside Out is easily in Pixar's top five or ten list.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Heart touching story of The Brain,"Nothing in the world is as powerful as emotions. Whatever we do, we do because we have emotions, either that be joy, sadness, fear, disgust or anger. These emotions are the key driving forces of our brain; our brains are controlled by them. Without one, the others can't continue on properly.This simple thing about ourselves is portrayed very well in the movie by Pete Docter; it was quite emotional. The concept behind the movie touched my heart. It brought back the memories of my childhood. It reminded me how I used to think/feel as a child. I can't get them back now, but to some extent, this movie does the job. I'm a child once again. I can feel such strong emotions that make me laugh, or cry. The last time I felt the same was while watching 'Toy Story 3'. 'Inside Out' is simply one of the brilliant animated features by Pixar.I waited a long time for this movie to be released. I expected it to be good one when I saw the trailer. However, it exceeded my expectations. It was quite heart touching that I couldn't resist myself giving this movie a 10 star. It's an excellent movie with a brilliant concept.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Inspiring and Entertaining,"I love this movie so much. It gives a very different aspect of thinking about your emotions in your mind. It is represented in a very entertaining but inspiring manner. It shows how every emotion is important to our life. So I highly recommend everyone to watch this movie which teaches us love, real love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An excellent and funny Pixar animation movie,"I am surprised so many people have reviewed this film with such negativity. As a mature individual well plus 21, I watched this movie with my wife and youngest child who is aged four. We all laughed all the way through.Sometimes, I wonder what people expect from a movie. Here we have an imaginative story line which truly gets into the mind of a young child with joy sadness fear anger and disgust.Yes, the characters for Mother and Father are a little stereotyped and there are moments in the film when you could easily feel disappointed or depressed but those moments are short and overall the film holds the attention of the audience from beginning to end.The storyline is simplistic and touching, nothing overly American about it, dealing with a child moving far away from home and looking at the problems she faces at home and at school in a fun and challenging way.This is no doubt a film aimed at a mixed audience of parent and child and teenagers too might find the topic of interest when looking at those five basic emotions applied to themselves.There are a lot of mediocre films about which fall well below the mark and not many in the category of family entertainment which are appealing across the generation divide. In my view, this one will appeal.It was the weekend, the film was recommended to me. It was a perfectly good moral film with a sound storyline and easy to follow. I did not have to think too much on any of the issues raised in the film. Younger children would not grasp the point made in the morality stakes but who cares so long as everyone who goes to see the film can eat their popcorn in safety and have a few laughs? Well, nearly everyone!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

It made me cry so bad and has a lasting impact on me.The film gives a beautiful vision of what our emotions might look like inside our heads.

So nice,"""Inside Out"" as an anime adaptation earns a heartfelt 7/10 from me, and I genuinely loved it. The animation beautifully translates the emotions inside Riley's mind, giving life to Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust with remarkable charm. While the pacing occasionally rushes through the emotional landscape, the strength of the story lies in its exploration of the complexity of human feelings and the importance of embracing sadness as a vital part of life. The music perfectly complements the film's emotional depth, and the message it conveys about growing up and understanding our emotions resonates deeply. ""Inside Out"" in anime form retains the heartwarming essence of the original, reminding us that it's okay to feel all the colors of our emotions, and my love for it is as colorful as the rainbow of Riley's feelings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Pixar at its best, again!","Having grown up on Disney and Pixar movies, it is easy to have a soft side for them while viewing and reviewing. But this comes from their long line up of successful movies which have pushed the boundaries of storytelling.I believe this is a must see movie by the kids and adults. Not just for the story and the characters (which is without a doubt, brilliant), but also for the way it is told and what it all means. Using emotions as characters, Peter Docter (director and co-writer) has the complex world and interaction that is in each of our head. The models and metaphors used is inventively awesome.The poignant moments are as important as the funny ones, which will be even more appreciated with multiple viewings.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Cool concept and animation with interesting characters.,"Based on all the hype I was expecting this film to be more than it was. It was still pretty good, but not something I would want to watch again - as a few of my friends said they would (and one did).The animation is very descriptive, colourful and cute. The shapes of the emotions and their colours are very typical of what we may attribute them to look. I'm a little confused at what 'gender' they might be and why it differs, because in the mother's head they are all female and pretty much look the same. I'm not sure about the father, but they might have all been male too, but don't look the same, rather are the same shape and pretty much the same look as the ones in Riley's head. Perhaps this is alluding to the idea that puberty/growing up changes the emotions in our heads, which make sense.The voice actors were pretty good, they match the feel of their characters really well and nothing seemed out of place. Richard Kind, who plays Bing Bong is a small treat and his creation is something that I think most everyone can relate to.I feel like I have outgrown most animation films, as I have been saying for awhile now. Some I can find quite enjoyable and love them to bits (Despicable Me, Tangled), but others though are enjoyable to watch I don't have much of an affinity for.There was a short film at the beginning before Inside Out started, and I was not really impressed by it. It doesn't seem to serve any purpose, was pretty cheesy, and more obviously geared towards children. I was very glad that was not part of the movie.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Just awful,"We had high hopes after reading the reviews but closed the movie down not even halfway in. A respected friend said that it had left him like a wet dishrag so we were intrigued to learn about how an animated film made for kids could possibly address such complex concepts. And we especially wondered how it could have been such a hit with respected critics and more importantly, young children. Sadly, we were completely bored. The animation is super-busy as is the dialogue. It's fun to hear the voices of a superstar cast, and some of the ideas are very insightful. But ultimately, it's a dull, boring movie with a high concept -> too wordy, leads nowhere, not worth hanging in to find out ""what happens"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I personally found this movie just amazing and had me sad in the right areas and happy in the others. Everything is just perfect and all just works.

So basically I vote ten out of ten complete stars on my rating of this movie. This should be a kids and family movie for everyone in the entire galactic world that we live in !

get ready for an emotional journey.,"Hearing so many good reviews for a movie can be a bad thing. For me it over hypes the movie and doesn't exceed the expectations. Maybe that's just because the disgust in my head made me think that. How does my mind really work?Inside Out is Pixar's latest film that takes you into the mind of a girl named Riley. In Riley's mind are five emotions. Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust. They make Riley who she is.Now going into this movie I feared that the movie wouldn't have much of a plot and that it might be annoying seeing it go back in forth between Riley's emotions and Riley herself. What I came to realize was that it was a perfect blend of all of it. I sat through in awe seeing the beautiful animations. This animation is just extremely beautiful seeing each character almost having a ton of detail to them. It isn't the best Pixar has done, but it is sure one of the best.How do the jokes hold up in this movie? I found myself laughing out loud a ton of times. What amazed me was that there were kiddy jokes. They were all stuff I could relate to or that were truly funny and I was very surprised by that. The movie has a great adult feel to it with all of it's complexity. Even though it has complexity, all ages will love it. It has some truly great writing.From what I have seen from reviews from people that this movie is slow at the beginning and a total depress fest movie and I would like to clear this up. He beginning of the movie is a bit slow. It has some funny stuff though that keeps it going, but it will go by pretty slow while it takes time to introduce everyone. As for depressing the movie handles itself quite well. There are two very sad parts that brought me to complete tears. I could hear people in the theatre crying and it was truly a sad part. Do I think it was too depressing? No, I don't. The movie takes the sad parts and mends itself. The message of the movie carries it along and if someone is going through depression and they see this.

A Swashbuckling Return To Form For Pixar Animation Studios!,"A swashbuckling return to form for Pixar Animation Studios, Inside Out arrives as a strong jolt of freshness from the talented minds responsible for groundbreaking classics like Toy Story, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille & WALL·E, commences the studio's long- awaited resurgence towards its lost glory, and in the process also reaffirms why Pixar is the most beloved, respected & finest animation studio on the planet.One of the most original, creative, intelligent, stunning & brightest ideas to come out from Pixar's repertoire in a very long time, Inside Out brims with sufficient dosage of intriguing concept, engaging storyline, rich characters, heartfelt emotions, gorgeous animation, stellar voice-cast & evocative score, and is an amalgamation of everything that has contributed in this famed studio's meteoric rise to the pinnacle of the animation film industry.A heartfelt tale about the difficulties of growing-up, Inside Out follows Riley: a young girl whose life hits a bumpy road when she is uprooted from her Midwest lifestyle after her father begins a new job in San Francisco, following which her emotions — Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust & Fear, work together in an effort to navigate her through this tough phase and help her adjust to her new life in the new city, house & school while Joy does her best to keep her happy.Co-written & directed by Pete Docter, Inside Out hits a third consecutive home-run for the director of Monsters, Inc. & Up, for it not only works as an inventive & imaginative feature film from the creative filmmaker but also succeeds as one of the most ambitious & audacious film projects undertaken by Pixar. The screenplay also wonderfully intertwines the two story lines set within the same picture; one concerning Riley while other following her emotions.Production Design team does a splendid job in creating the world for the emotions to reside in. Even those emotions are cleverly imagined, designed & rendered on the screen, and it's easy to identify one from its shape & colour alone. Cinematography makes excellent use of camera to capture every action in fine detail while its colour palette makes exquisite use of five different hues, each associated with a certain emotion, whose shades are applied to the whole world within the mind.Editing unfolds its narrative steadily & its 94 minutes of runtime is briskly paced. The score is composed by Michael Giacchino but isn't as memorable as I expected. The performance by its voice cast continues Pixar's tradition of coming up with a fitting ensemble that infuses new life into its animated characters and amongst all, it's Amy Poehler & Phyllis Smith (the voices of Joy & Sadness, respectively) who impress the most, share a wonderful chemistry, and are the very soul of Inside Out.But despite getting most things right, Inside Out isn't without its flaws for there are a few elements that don't work out in its favour. First is its attempt at humour which at times feels forced. Next up is Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong who is pretty annoying for the most part. Michael Giacchino's score is a letdown too as mentioned above. And finally, there's this contrast between its seemingly childish humour & the subject matter that's more oriented towards grown-ups, which hinders the overall enjoyment on few occasions.On an overall scale, Inside Out is the strongest Pixar film to surface on the big screen since Toy Story 3 that guarantees to take its viewers through every emotion and absolutely delivers on that promise. It shows that growing-up isn't always a fun, carefree experience and also illustrates the importance of sadness in our life as well as the changes any emotion can trigger in our behaviour. I'd been waiting a long time for Pixar to come up with a cinema like this & while it may not be as perfect as their finest works, it's destined to become a Pixar classic in the years to come.

One of the Most Creative Animations Ever Made,"The eleven year-old Riley is a happy girl in Minnesotta with her family, friends and hockey team. When her family moves to San Francisco, her emotions have a conflict and Joy and Sadness lose the command of her actions. The other emotions - Fear, Anger and Disgust – do not know how to handle the girl that has difficulties to adapt herself to the big city and to the new school and hockey team. Meanwhile Joy and Sadness team up with her imaginary friend Bing Bong and try to reach the Headquarter of her mind to control her emotions again.""Inside Out"" is one of the most creative animations ever made. The story entertains not only children but also adults that see it in a different layer. The most impressive is that the film is touching in many moments. I have not seen the other films nominated to the Oscar in this category, including the Brazilian one, but I hope ""Inside Out"" wins the Oscar. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Divertida Mente"" (""Entertaining Mind"" in a pun in Portuguese)",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Entertaining, But Not As ""On Point"" As Other Pixar Efforts","Toy Story...Wall-E...Up...Finding Nemo...etc. When a company (Pixar) makes films of that caliber, it is a difficult task to keep ""upping the ante"" with subsequent releases. While ""Inside Out"" is (at the very least) entertaining, it doesn't quite live up to the bar of greatness set by previous Pixar installments.For a basic plot summary, ""Inside Out"" tells the story of an 11-year old girl named Riley (voiced by Kaitlyn Dias), who is moving from Minnesota to San Francisco. This is obviously a big change in Riley's life, and it is when we are introduced to the emotions inside her head: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black), & Disgust (Mindy Kaling). All of Riley's outward emotions are controlled by these core emotions in the ""command center"" of her brain. As Riley struggles to acclimate to her new home, school, and environment, these emotions struggle to figure out their place in the overall scheme of her personality.The concept behind ""Inside Out"" is original and entertaining. It's fun/interesting to see our emotions represented like that, and it provides for both some very happy/uplifting, as well as very sad/depressing, moments throughout. In terms of original concept and interesting ideas, ""Inside Out"" may actually be one of Pixar's best.However, I found the execution of those ideas to be only so-so. I had two complaints (this is coming from an adult perspective, of course) while watching the movie...1. When the camera ""pulls back"" to see Riley interacting with her parents and environment, that is when this film works the best. However, a majority of the film is spent inside Riley's brain dealing with the emotions themselves. For example, a subplot involving Joy being separated from the command center takes up quite a bit of time. I just wish things could have been a bit more balanced.2. More so than any other Pixar film, ""Inside Out"" seems to really ""go for the cry"", so to speak. I've never been in a theater where so many sniffles and even outright sobbing could be heard. I have no problem with that at face value, as great films are supposed to grab at the emotions, but this one just felt expressly made to do so. I shed some tears at the end of ""Toy Story 3"" and at the beginning of ""Up"", but I really feel that was because those montages were so well-made and natural to the plot of those films. With ""Inside Out"", at times I felt like the entire point of the experience was to have parents bawling.That being said, even though this one didn't rank as high as other Pixar efforts in my book, it was still fun to watch. I thoroughly enjoyed the unique concept and really liked the parts where the emotions in Riley's (and her parents') brain directly influence conversations and interactions in the real world. Highly recommended for all audiences and (as usual) perfect for families. But be warned: if you are a parent, you might want to keep a few tissues handy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Pixar and Disney, can't get better than that","This is one of the better animated films I have seen. Congrats to the directors because the movie was able to summon all sorts of emotions in me with just it's atmosphere. It looks perfect. Characters are well designed and very fun. The world inside Riley's head looks beautiful. The film is as interesting as it could get. Not for a second will you think this could be a little more fun.Animations, as always in Pixar films, were amazing.Let's talk a little about what is going on in the film and the screenplay. I'm guessing you all had that thought that there is something in your head controlling you...some people, little versions of you or whatever. Writers managed to show it perfectly. Like they had imagination of a child and intelligence of an adult. There is a high chance that you will find yourself in the film. You will remember what it was like to be a child and you will see how you lost some fun memories, how they faded over time. You will see how you changed and how your thinking has changed. You will be sad at one point when you realize what you lost in transformation from child to an adult. One of the most important things is that this film carries a message...I will let you figure it out by yourselves while you're watching. Editing was great. It goes fluently from scene to scene, feels perfect. Music is also very good. Goes beautifully with emotions you get from the film. It kind of reminds me of the music from ""The Sims"" games. Anyway...Great film. Recommended for people of all ages. If you haven't seen it already I don't know what are you waiting for. Go watch it now!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Enjoyable but overrated,"In my opinion, this movie is just a tad overrated. Here we'll start with what I deem the most important aspect to every movie's entertainment: characters. That's right, if I don't care about one or more of the movie's characters, it's hard for me to get into it. Now, I wouldn't say that Inside Out's characters were bad per se, however I would say they were pretty one-dimensional, particularly the 5 emotions. But how could they not be to some extent though? After all, they're all basically single emotions personalized into physical beings, rather than a whole human character. Therefore, I'll first state that I have no problems with how the scriptwriters have handled them, considering that there aren't really any other options in regards to how they could've written them. But that in itself is a problem I have with the entire concept of the movie. Now, as a whole, the concept is a very clever and innovative one; it explains how our minds work through creative metaphors and analogies that are easy for the audience to grasp. But for this concept to work, the characters of the personified emotions would have to only be limited to the traits of the emotion they are meant to represent respectively, otherwise they would miss the point of their respective character altogether. Thus, they'd have no choice but to be confined in stereotypical boxes, with not much space for their personalities to be expanded upon, thus they become predictable and repetitive after a while. This wouldn't be much of a problem for people who pay more attention to the general concept and storyline, as the character's interactions would be enough to keep them entertained during the filler parts, but as I said, I really want to focus on the characters when watching a movie, and relying on interactions(no matter how meaningful or entertaining) solely just isn't enough for me. So I guess this concept just isn't for me, though I do think of it as clever and charming.Now on to the main human character, Riley. I'll start by saying that I really like how they distanced her from stereotypes as much as possible. She has both a girly and a boyish side to her, for example. And there's also a bunch of random traits and preferences thrown into her character, like hating broccoli, goofball etc. To be honest, I liked this, as I do think that our personalities are comprised of many different traits and preferences which all stems from our reaction to past experiences. Some of these traits make us seem like a walking stereotype, while others make us seem like a walking contradiction. However, the problem I have with her character is exactly the opposite of the problem I had with the emotions'. When the emotions interacted together, you could see that they were all bursting with their own personalities which made them very distinguishable from each other. They were like a rainbow when joined together, however each one of them only represented their own respective color, and if you examined them on their own, they turn into a one-dimensional stereotype, like when you take one color out of the rainbow and focus on it, it will seem bland and flat to your eyes. But put them together, and you get a very colorful image. As for Riley, it's like taking a bunch of different colors and mixing them together, only to get a murky saturation. Sure she has a bunch of traits mixed into her character, but none of them are developed enough, and so they remain just general traits that just sort of mix together to make up a bland, uninteresting character that I feel indifferent about.Another(albeit minor) complaint I have is that the film seems to drag on half-way through, specifically when Joy and Sadness are trying to navigate their way back to headquarters. The whole journey just seemed to drag when I was watching the film, and my interest waned. That's not to say that there are no entertaining moments throughout the film, however, as there are certainly moments of charm and humor shared between the characters. Not to mention the little moment shared between Sadness and Bing Bong (definitely one of my favorite moments in the film, as it was inspiring, moving and powerful all at the same time, and it was an important scene of foreshadowing towards the end) and of course, when Joy and Bing Bong were trapped in the memory dump (though I wasn't quite as moved at the scene as most people were, because I found it predictable and wasn't too attached to Bing Bong's character in the first place). However, aside from those two important parts, the rest of the journey seemed mundane, and while there were the aforementioned charming moments littered here and there across it, they felt too short and fleeting to enliven the entire journey for me, so the sense of boredom still lingered throughout the course of the movie.So, those are my main issues with the film. Like most people here, I felt that the end scene was truly amazing, as it captured the feelings of longing and reminiscence perfectly, allowing for an empathetic bond to form between the audience and main character. It has moved me in more ways than one, it has deeply inspired me with it's message of emotional intelligence, and that is no easy feat. Yet, the movie manages to do just that with one scene alone; it was that powerful. Overall, I would say that the movie is successful in presenting the difference between the feeling of suppressing an emotion and the feeling of actually feeling that emotion. For that, I would say I liked it overall. But the issues I had with it (particularly in regards to the character department) definitely dampened my experience of viewing it. Thus, I'd say that I probably don't favor it quite as much as most people on here do.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The most moving and funny Pixar film in a long time.,"Going into this film I really didn't know what to expect from it. The trailers had given me a basic idea of the plot, a girl and her emotions, but other than that I really had no idea what it would be about or how they could make 94 minutes of content with such a simple idea. However, having now watched the film I can look back on those thoughts and laugh at how wrong I was. Inside Out is just overflowing with brilliance, and I would honestly consider it to be in my top 3 Pixar movies, slowly creeping closer to my number one every passing day.The basic plot follows an 11 year old girl called Riley who is going through a tough time as she is forced to move away from her home and set up a new life in a different state. We see how she feels about her situation through five personified emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger who make her feel certain emotions from a control panel in her brain. Joy tries her best to make Riley feel happy but due to her situation Sadness begins to have more of an affect on Riley's outlook. Joy and Sadness eventually get lost inside Riley's mind leaving the other three emotions to try and work things out themselves.While the plot of the movie may seem a little simple it's actually extremely fun to see Joy and Sadness navigate their way through different parts of Riley's brain whether it be her imagination or her abstract thought, it makes every part of the movie seem new and exciting and overall makes the adventure all the more enjoyable. Every actor in the movie is absolutely spot on, particularly Bill Hader as Fear and Lewis Black as Anger, they all bring a certain charm to each individual emotion and their comedic timing makes the jokes hilarious and memorable.Insides Out script is also extremely well written, the comedy is well timed, relevant and intelligent, making way for classic kids comedy as well as implementing old school laughs as well (There is even a Chinatown reference in this movie!) However, the real magic in this script is in its emotional themes. Pixar is not new to writing emotionally powerful scenes, but Inside Out takes it a step farther. The movie deals with growing up in an almost poetic way, showing how we let go of our childhood in our minds in order to accept the adult reality around us. The film shows how every kid feels when they realise it's time to grow up and how it can be difficult to let our childhood slip away but also necessary to let some of the more grown up things be a part of us, and ultimately make us a better person.All in all, Inside Out is a step in the right direction for Pixar and movies as a whole. The acting is perfect, the script is genius, the animation is beautiful and the themes are powerful. If you see one movie this year make it Inside Out, you'll cry with laughter one minute then sob your eyes out the next. It may seem cheesy but this movie really is an emotional journey and by the end you will be thinking to yourself: ""I wonder what the emotions in MY head are like?"" I guarantee it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
great movie with a powerful message regarding our children emotions..,"Usually don't write movie reviews since everyone views things so much differently. But I felt compelled to do so, especially after watching this with my 2 daughters 12 & 8 yr old. Yes I understand we parents impact out children's lives and emotions, feelings, thoughts, perceptions and most importantly their lasting memories...which help defines their character & emotional state later in life. The parents are a reflection of their children and we must sacrifice ourselves at times so that our children feelings are taking into consideration. This movie really brings this to life and makes you (the parent) take in consideration of your children's emotional state.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Incredible Imagery Makes For A Staggeringly Good Film,"""Inside-Out"" ReviewNow allow me to start by saying this, when I was watching the previews for this film originally, I was saying to myself ""Oh god, another one of these."" I simply had no care, nor any intention of seeing it. BUT then I started hearing the reviews, about how simply amazing it was, and how everyone should take the time to see it. But even then, I was kind of ""Ehhhhh I don't know."" And then, my friend finally convinced me to see it. I didn't know what to expect.Now to wrap all of the ""Oh I was wrong"" and ""I regret thinking what I did of this movie"" and all that crap. Inside-Out is what of the most emotionally beautiful movies I have seen this year. It is a beautiful tale of an adolescent girl coming to terms with childhood depression. Frankly it has some of the best imagery of ANY movie I have ever seen. And let me tell youit gave me some serious feels.One of the greatest approaches to this movie is how we see the emotions/the brain growing and learning as the characters age. From the moment where we are born to the moment where we die, we are constantly learning and adapting as we enter the different stages of our life. The ""Emotions"" as I am going to refer to them as, are learning as the characters grow. Which is a WONDERFUL symbolism for the brain developing.I know that I have dealt with childhood depression, especially throughout my teenage years, and so seeing this simply incredibly imagery of this unfolding into a young girl gave me a sense of immersion. I was able to relate to it. And as I have said, I love it with I can immerse myself in with a scene or character (because I am weird like that).The only problem I really dealt with is that it felt like it was going so quickly in the beginning to encounter the main problem and then it slowed down to a crawl. However, in some ways it felt necessary. Not only for the plot, but for the imagery of how depression feels. Depression makes you feel like the world has stopped. You shut down. And those emotions that have been eating away at you take over and start controlling every decision you make, even involuntarily. So, honestly, I can't give much negativity on the slowness of the movie, because that really is how it was supposed to be.In conclusion, this movie was incredible. It was beautiful, funny, emotional, and really everything it needed to be to get the point across and be a fun movie to watch at the same time. Definitely a movie to go and see for the summerregardless of how late this review has come out. Final Score: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Fantastic movie... for parents,"The storytelling here is absolutely masterful. Inside Out is a well thought out and in depth allegory for the interaction of human emotion. Each and every metaphor used rings so true as to bring tears to your eyes or smiles to your face. Parents will connect with all the feeling they remember of trying times and passions from their youth.The slight misstep made in this film is that the story assumes a fairly mature comprehension of emotion. It deals with concepts that will not resonate with young children as they have either not experienced or not understood feelings in this manner before. This is not to say the content is inappropriate in any way, simply that it may not connect with the youngest audiences. For parents and school aged kids 8+ this is a wonderful movie. For little tykes, you may find them more engrossed with the Minions movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"A Strong, Emotional Film From Pixar","After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions -- Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness -- conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house and school.As with many popular, successful movies, this one has caused a great deal of response on the Internet. Many people love it, and it currently (January 2016) sits in the Top 100 on IMDb. And, of course, we begin to get a push back with people calling it overrated, over-hyped, and some even saying it is offensive in its depiction of gender and inappropriate for children.The path it has followed through award season has had a similar up and down trajectory. Early on, it was seen as the clear winner of the animation Oscar and even in the running for Best Picture. Gradually slipping, it now seems to be 50/50 for animation (up against ""Anomalisa"") with zero chance of getting anywhere near Best Picture. Sorry, Pixar.As with anything, the reality is never as rosy or as bleak as the Internet would like it to be. ""Inside Out"" may not be Best Picture, but it has a better-than-average chance of landing the animation Oscar. And that is because you rarely get a cartoon that reaches this deep inside its audience. A film about emotions (or lack thereof) that actually makes you feel.This is not a children's movie. The kids will enjoy the bright colors and characters, especially Bing Bong. And there is nothing ""adult"" in terms of violence, nudity or cursing. (There is one subtle reference to the San Francisco homosexual community, but it is not offensive or derogatory.) This may be the darkest Pixar film yet, thematically. Depression, loneliness, alienation. The adults are the ones who will really appreciate this sad story of change and end of innocence.Director Pete Docter, who previously made ""Up"", has set the bar high for himself here if he continues making movies (which, of course, he will). He could even have achieved for himself a place alongside John Lasseter in the hall of great animation directors. He assembled this one just right, down to the voices -- Lewis Black and Phyllis Smith are the very embodiment of the emotions they portray.Although the best animation in recent years remains ""Wreck-It Ralph"", this film clearly has to rank among the finest, giving such movies as ""Ralph"" and ""Toy Story 3"" a run for their money.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Clever and creative,"What a terrific movie for the whole family. It gives very creative insight into emotions and memories. The construct of this movie is very clever and insightful. An emotional roller coaster of a film that is most definitely one of the best Disney / Pixar films of all time. This coming from someone who grew up with the Lion King, Pinocchio, Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, etc. Aside from this film being a huge box office success and bringing me to tears multiple times I still find bad reviews on this website. The ""critics"" who are saying this movie is anything but phenomenal either didn't get enough hugs growing up or are simply here to disregard quality. There are no other movies like this one.

About emotions but not emotional,"This is a tough one to judge: on one hand I praise Pixar for trying to make a film out of a rather unconventional idea. Monsters (2001) did this too and was also from the same director. I can image it's hard to predict if you can make such an idea into a great movie. Well it turns out it's rather difficult. The biggest problem this movie has is the characters. They are certainly not as good as those in the Toy Story movies, they just don't seem to be as likable even tough Pixar really tries to make you like 'em. What I did like was that the film sometimes felt a bit bleaker and surrealistic (a kind of Alice in Wonderland feel) than most other Pixar flicks. It does seem strange that a film which revolves around emotions struggles a bit with just that as it has difficulty emotionally involving the audience. I certainly don't think it's a bad film, in my book it's still way better than those lame Cars films but it's not in the Pixar top list.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Hands down! Animation's finest!,"Inside Out is definitely one of animation's biggest benchmarks in the history of the animated. So good a movie! It is not just entertainment, it is edutainment. If you pay attention you would be logically thrilled as well. It is like the inception of animation. Only simpler to understand yet intricate at so many levels!This has to be placed amongst the greats. Not only is this movie extremely hilarious, it is also very dramatic, highly educative, and morally impeccable.Taking up two big plots simultaneously in the vanguard was a Herculean task per se. But Pete Doctor and Ronaldo Del Carmen merge them just fine to weave an excellent coming-of-age story of Riley whose life decisions are technically controlled by voices in her head. We have Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust that literally define the head of our protagonist.The concept is simply outstanding. Notions that define how we feel have been brought to life by Pixar's amazing animation and they look downright perfect. Thoughts, memories, imagination, sub-conscious every area of a human brain has been beautifully and subtly portrayed using humorous characters as props. Watch out for the adorable Bing Bong!The drama is absolutely melting. So warm and so right that it beats every non-animated drama flick to pulp. The Bing Bong fate and the gloom of the memory dump are the most melodramatic bits in the movie that would uproot your heart away.Michael Giacchino's music is simply amazing. The composition is quite soothing. He stops playing his notes at dramatic bits for emphasis and then lightens up the mood, after the grim passes. Really thoughtful!There are valued lessons strewn all across the movie that just feels so right, and have been exploited in the right amounts. Humour is always lurking around in the corner even in the direst of circumstances and you end up laughing every time. Amy Poehler's voice makes Joy, well you know, joyous. Phyllis Smith's voice as Sadness is quite endearing. Bill, Diane, Kyle and Richard just make everything better.Oh and there is an amazing short called Lava that plays in the beginning! Giving you a heads up there! Exceptional stuff!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Emotional Gut Punches,"Good lord, people love Pixar. The theaters in town were packed with poor souls with twenty seven kids, grown men without kids and us taking our 5 year old Daughter to the movies. Whats more intriguing is every kid in a packed audience shutting up from start to finish. Grown people don't even do that. (They should though, you know who you are)That says something. When Pixar nails it, they really nail it and with Inside Out, they nailed it. It starts off hitting you in the face with emotional Mike Tyson uppercuts and ear bites. It may help that I'm a dad to a little girl but hey, we were all little girls once. Or uh, little kids once.Watching this little girl go through the tough times of life is heart wrenching. It's a great reminder of how devastatingly the outside world can effect the little ones. The originality displayed in how they crafted her mind to really project the many emotions and layers of a human psyche is truly impressive.Inside Out really shines when they show the correlation to whats going on in the outside world & how it effects the mind and body. Seeing the Parents efforts truly change the course of a life in mere moments is some heavy stuff. The whole middle act however?Things become less touching and innovative and lend to a more adventure-ish ""gotta get from point A to point B before C happens"" race when some of the emotions go haywire and have to find their way back. From here we spend a lot of our time inside the mind and imagination. Things becomes more Magic School Bus than truly breakthrough for a while and hey, that's OK. Magic School Bus was awesome. But things did get a bit average in the middle acts.The ending brings back the correlation to real world and with it come the tears and emotions. As well as breakthrough ideas and originality. You can't help but watch and wonder the many, many places they could go with this idea. The well of emotions, stages of life, different types of people......it's an endless, genius idea. But what makes Inside Out work isn't this idea alone. We really care about this kid and her parents and we relate to their joy, fear, disgust, anger and sadness.No really, I had man tears. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A good film. Inside and out,"Despite the good reviews I was a little unsure of whether I would like 'Inside Out' going into the cinema. I mean, a film about the emotions in a little girls head, how funny could that be? I am pleased to say that I was wrong. Not only is 'Inside Out' a funny film but it is also incredibly moving, with some real moments of heart.What I love about Pixar films at their best is that they don't talk down to kids. 'Inside Out' is actually a really complex film, but there are enough big moments to keep both kids and adults engaged throughout the film's running time.Having been slightly underwhelmed by 'Ratatouille', 'Brave' and 'Cars', I'm pleased that Pixar are back on form.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Inside out, a perfect example of imagination","Disney and Pixar have teamed up once again and brought us inside out, a film that explores the emotions inside an 11 year Old's head and the personified emotions that control it, I won't go in depth because you should definitely experience this movie yourself without knowing too much about the plot beforehand.I'll start with the flaws or more accurately flaw because I only had one with this movie and it was rather minuscule. My single problem with this movie is that I didn't find there to be much of a score, when the score was prevalent it was great, terrific ambiance that set the mood beautifully but I felt there were some scenes that definitely could have used some more music backing them up.Looking at the casting for this movie I thought it would be perfect, and I was right. Amy Poehler was absolutely perfect as joy and Lewis Black as Anger? completely ingenious casting decision. I'd put the animation in this film up against any other animated film, it was lush, bright, defined, simply beautiful. The subject matter in this movie will touch teens, young and older adults more so than children, not that children won't enjoy this movie but I can't help but feel that they just don't have enough life experience to fully understand it which I think is a good thing. it's a film they can grow old with and see it differently as time passes.This is a movie about emotions which is sort of ironic because it's an incredible emotional experience. It was very interesting to see how much differently this was affecting people in the theater, some were crying, some were laughing and I can almost guarantee ALL were enjoying. The whole duration of this movie I found myself thinking ""Pete Docter and his team may have what could be the greatest imagination in the business"" this movie is simple but makes you think at the same time which seem like opposing ideas but just watch the movie and you'll know what I mean.Inside out is a terrific film animated or otherwise. It'll make you laugh, cry, think, and most importantly, have fun. Go see this film, take your kids, parents, grandparents, friends and anyone else you enjoy watching movies with, they'll all take away something different from it but I bet they will all love it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The most creative animated film of the digital era,"When Pixar announced ""Up"" and ""Monsters Inc."" director Pete Docter's ""Untitled Pixar Film that Takes You Inside the Mind,"" there was little doubt that the animation giant and its brilliant minds had yet another work of genius in development. Flash forward and the revolutionary studio has not disappointed with this endlessly creative, whimsical journey now titled ""Inside Out.""This totally original film couldn't have come too soon for Pixar fans following the commercial cash-grabs that were ""Cars 2"" and ""Monsters University"" and the beautiful yet very traditional fairy tale ""Brave"" (not to mention no film in 2014). It's a huge bounce back, and it would not be a stretch to call this Pixar's most creative film, or even the most creative animated film of the digital era.The story depicts 11-year-old Riley's first major life challenge: moving from Minnesota to San Francisco with her mother and father. Yet it imagines her entire personality/brain as its own living world, piloted by her five chief emotions, all personified as characters: Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Fear (Bill Hader) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling).Narrated by Joy, we see key moments of Riley's life growing up that have become her ""core memories,"" represented as shiny orbs, with each memory triggering a part of Riley's personality. To this point, Riley's core memories are all tinted yellow because they have been joyful, and Joy plans to keep it that way. The big move, however, makes this challenging, and after a struggle with Sadness, Joy and Sadness find themselves booted out of Riley's command center and into her long- term memory.With only Anger, Fear and Disgust to guide her, Riley becomes unpredictable, and Joy and Sadness must find their way back before the damage becomes irreversible. Along the way, they team up with Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong, who assists (and innocently misguides) their journey through all parts of Riley's mind including her abstract thought and subconscious.The praise for ""Inside Out"" could stop at the fact that it's a compelling animated film without a main villain. When was the last time you saw one of those? Case in point. The story creates danger and suspense by throwing new obstacles at Joy and Sadness left and right, creating a sense of doubt wondering what might happen to Riley if they can't make it back to ""head""quarters. Docter and co- writer/director Ronaldo Del Carmen use sheer creative force to fuel intrigue in the other moments.""Inside Out"" is awe-inspiring in the way it fully develops this personified version of the mind and carries it through to fruition with such conviction that none of the loose ends in the concept derail it. This is exceptionally elaborate, demolishing even ""Wreck- It Ralph"" in terms of world-building. From how the mind processes and removes memories to what is going on when you dream, the film is an ever-growing tower of ""what if we did this?!"" ideas piled one on top of the other and it never topples over.Pixar's trademark tear-jerking, heartstring-tugging M.O. is in place here as well, even if not to the same extent as ""Toy Story 3"" or the flashback sequence in ""Up."" The importance of love and support, the challenges of childhood – the connections the film makes to the human experience are so profound and direct despite such an abstract premise and unusual storyline.Topped with spot-on voice casting and a visual style that distinguishes itself while remaining true to Pixar's form, ""Inside Out"" is an instantly lovable film for kids and adults, one that current children will grow to love different at each stage in their lives. Speaking of, the bar is quite high for a puberty-driven sequel.~Steven CThanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Easily one of the best and most complex animated movies in a long time,"First off, the detractors of this film cannot seem to agree on their argument about why it is bad. ""It's too realistic, and therefore depressing..."" ""It's too UNrealistic, because it doesn't show a girl from a broken home or abusive parents..."" ""It's too heavy for kids and they won't get it..."" For what it is worth, this film is both entertaining AND fascinating. The depiction of Riley's brain is actually very well thought-out and digestible for young kids, and its complexities can be appreciated further by adults and older kids. It's very true that there are many jokes and plot points that will go well over the heads of young children, but the underlying message is wonderful and heartbreaking at the same time. Making a movie that is kid-centered and kid-targeted is very different than making a movie that is kid-friendly. Some of the most effective family movies of all time have significantly adult themes and plot points. Think about how ET, the first time you saw it, was likely a sob-fest (at least for a while), but ended up being a classic. Toy Story, while a bit more understandable for kids, deals with the crisis of not having an identity and finding a place for yourself. This movie is much the same, as it deals with the sad reality that childhood memories DO eventually go away, and growing up is a tough thing to do. But, on the other side, it leads to a more complex, more whole person. Again, this movie ended up affecting me more than I had expected or was even prepared for, and it made me reflect on my own growing up in a poignant way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Better than I expected,"We each carry our own stories into movies about childhood. Somehow I expected Riley's emotions to be in conflict rather than genuinely trying to keep her on track as she grows. I also somehow expected her parents to be less caring than they actually were. This story is, instead, a profile of an emotionally healthy couple and their only child living through a bit of a rough patch.Our adult daughter and her 4, 6, and 8 year old children saw the movie with us and all of them liked it a lot. Not all the action was wrapped in deep thought - there were several laugh-out-loud moments that worked even for the 4 year old. None of the kids got restless or talkative, a good measure of their absorption. However, I would be concerned about sensitive teens seeing the series of setbacks in the movie. They went over the heads of our young ones but a 15 year old girl may not be so sanguine.I liked that the last five minutes or so of the movie came after the resolution but were not an anticlimax at all... they were many of the funniest scenes in the movie. That gave me time to dry my eyes inconspicuously.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Brilliant and Creative. Top Marks for Pixar,"Pixar as we've always know have proved to the world that they can deliver all sorts of emotions and messages in their wonderful films but Inside Out takes that to a whole new level. Riley's story can be relatable to many people in the world but the message and emotions she goes through is relatable to everyone. We all experience happy, sad, fearful, anger and distraughting moments constantly through our lives and Pixar truly delivers on this film by showing why it's important to have all those moments in life as they help us grow as an individual and learn valuable lessons. It's incredible to see Pixar deliver their powerful life lesson through such creative way, which is something that has been lacking in their recent films but Inside Out puts Pixar back on the top mark.It's absolutely brilliant and can be watched over and over again and feel something new every time you re watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Smart, insightful, moving, and fun","By the time I finally got to see this film, I had already heard lots of praise for it, lots of talking head mulling over whether it has a shot at Best Picture (not just animated), and lots of other things that told me this was supposed to be a great film. Of course, even without this, the film still has the weight of other great Pixar movies down the years, so it already has a high bar to clear even without the additional hype. Watching it for myself though I was surprised by how little I thought of such things, and how totally I just enjoyed the film on its own terms. Ironically, I did this because of how accurate all the positive reviews and buzz were, because Inside Out is a really great film.Constructed on a reality which all parents of older children will no doubt connect to, the film takes the emotional change of a girl into a young teenager and puts it into a comedic adventure story set inside her head. The world inside her head is not only engaging, but incredibly smart – how accurate it is to the real world of psychology (if those words fit together) I do not know, but it is impressively constructed and also designed to make sense, be accessible, and also create a world for colorful characters to delight on an adventure level while also carrying the emotional punch to deliver a much bigger story (although also a very personal one too). It is as moving as it is funny, and as insightful and as it fun, and it is impressive how it is all put together. The animation is topnotch as ever, and the voice cast are not just famous names but well cast famous names who fit their characters well – with Poehler being a strong lead, while Smith, Black, Kaling, and Hader all doing great work (along with many other supporting characters – not least of which being Dias as Riley herself).I doubt voters would be able to bring themselves to vote for it to win Best Picture while being 'just a cartoon' but at the same time it is hard to imagine that 2015 will produce a better, smarter, and more effective film.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Meaningful But Underexplored, it Feels Like Pixar Left a Few Things Unsaid Here","Pixar goes cerebral, visualizing hormones and emotions as walking, talking avatars in the mind of a pre-teen girl. Shaken by a cross-country move at a very sensitive age, we see her struggle from both perspectives: in the upstairs control room, where various color-coded operators are baffled by her mood swings, and in the outside world, where friends and family are similarly perplexed. Inside Out is a high-concept production, one which does occasionally beat us over the head with symbolism, but its writing is generally sharp and clever and it's adept at distilling lofty ideas to a format that's digestible for all ages. And Pixar certainly knows how to tug the heart strings, as they do repeatedly during the dueling inside/outside crises at the film's climax.Not as consistent as the studio's better efforts, the plot is a balancing act between moments where the philosophical gambles pay off and those where it gets a little too cute. The vital push-and-pull between Hope and Sadness is at the heart of things, an uneasy friendship/rivalry that tips and sways before reaching a state of zen, and that's handled very well. The two abstract creatures' escape through the long-term memory banks and bumpy rides on the train of thought... eh, those felt like more of a reach. A convenient use of familiar terms to suit the narrative.When they work, Inside Out's big concepts are deep and powerful; an elegant way to dissect complicated thoughts and feelings by way of shiny blue, gold and purple cupie dolls. When they don't, the illusion swiftly falls apart. Before the story concludes, we get plenty of the former, but also a not-insignificant helping of the latter. A nice rebound from the missteps of Cars 2 and Monsters University, but not quite as sweeping, engulfing, or rewarding as the pillars of the studio's classic catalog.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A perfect blend of joy and sadness,"This was clearly written, acted, and directed by people who really understand the subtle shades of emotion. ""Inside Out"" ranks alongside ""Up"" for beautiful, intelligent story-telling.The comedy is well-done, providing plenty of laughs without overwhelming the story, so the film stands up to repeated viewing. Fair warning: if you go in expecting laugh-a-minute, mindless slapstick, then you'll probably be disappointed. But if you are willing to acknowledge Sadness, you will be rewarded with a story that stays with you long after the credits are finished.TL;DR? Ignore the haters, and enjoy being turned inside out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A new Pixar Masterpiece,"This is an amazing film. It sets the bar on how an animated film should be made. What makes this so great is that it's very mature. It's emotionally complex, in a way that will have kids and adults going back to this film and wondering about what it's going for. Unlike some kids films these days, it never talks down to its audience. The characters are all very deep and interesting, and of course, the animation is fantastic. But I find it innovative how they used the bright colors inside Riley's mind but used darker and more dreary colors in the real world.Parents, in terms of how appropriate it is for your kid, keep in mind that this is emotional throughout and has very powerful scenes that will seem abnormal to your kid. Also, there is a lot of adult humor, including legit swear words that are bleeped out.Please. Go see this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A creative, surprsing, and fun film that adults will enjoy","I have come to love Pixar movies because they are disguised as children's cartoons, but what I find time and again is the opposite, a deep and well thought-out story that strives to activate your sense of meaning and purpose (in fact, the children in the theatre seemed to be confused by the complexity and didn't get the good jokes). The fantastic, playful and realistic 3-d animation is just icing on a really delicious story.In the case of Pixar's latest movie, we are challenged as a viewer to consider how our own emotions have impacted our childhood development and adult life experience. I find that the story team and director at Pixar did a phenomenal job at building a robust framework for understanding human emotion, and its impact on our decisions and behavior, in a simple illustrative process that even a child could understand. Seeing this framework come to life in animation gave substance to understanding our own emotions in a new way.I had fun, laughs, and shed some tears too. The story is touching, an emotional journey. I love how unique Inside Out is compared to the same-old dribble being pumped-out by mainstream studios, which sell the same already-told stories repackaged with new actors. As expected from any Pixar movie, Inside Out allows one to escape from that mindless dribble for a moment, and enjoy the surprise that awaits with each scene.Thank You Pixar, and keep up the great work!

What's Going on Inside My Head?,"I walked out of the theater amazed by this purely original movie that Pixar has made. Watching it you can't help but think what emotion is in control right know? Is it Anger? Sadness? or Joy? Pixar shows how much fun they can make movies but that they also have a big heart, unlike most animated movies now. Pixar crafts this movie in ways that make sense like: why you don't remember when you were a baby, why you remember certain things well and others not so much, and what happens when you feel a bunch of different emotions at once. I had a blast watching The Emotions fight over what Riley should do or say.

Internal Portrait of Growing Up,"Pixar returns to their high-concept roots with Inside Out, showing us how emotions work through the human mind in a whimsically metaphorical way. It's the kind of idea that Pixar would definitely take at some point as they have always been bringing us a variety of emotions in their films. This movie explores childhood and growing up into the perspective of a little girl's mind, how the emotions get confused by the changes in life and how they have to gain back the light. Inside Out represents this angst with a delightful, yet profound adventure; which indeed results to a totally heartwarming experience.This concept explores emotions, personalities and imaginations of an individual, but the film's focus is an 11-year-old girl named Riley who moves to a new city with her family, but troubles to adapt and letting go. This made the emotions trying to avoid her from sadness, but instead lead her primal emotions to get lost somewhere that stores her long-term memory. And this does indicate the idea of being overly attached to the past, but also tells that growing up requires moving on and accepting whatever life would take you to. And this also went to a stronger and sophisticated turn, which is mainly about the purpose of every emotion and the benefit of expressing them, whether it seems good or bad. The movie smartly puts these ideas together as a whimsical journey of learning to understand whatever circumstance you are facing, but also examines the shortcomings of being dishonest to your own feelings.And again, these ideas are represented as an adventure with a lot of laughs and creativity to follow through. Aside of its thematic core, it also explores how dreams are made, how fears become exaggerated form of nightmares, how prominent memories also hook stuff that you don't necessarily need like commercial songs, and how imaginary places and friends come to life and interact with the emotions. It's a fun atmosphere to look around. The characters are delightful. Even if they're supposed to represent a single emotion, they brought more personalities than they should. The voice acting is wondrous: Amy Poehler brings a sense of lovable optimism in Joy and Phyllis Smith gives earnestness to Sadness. While Bill Hader adds low-key charm as Fear, Mindy Kaling gives the attitude as Disgust, and Lewis Black mostly stealing every scene as Anger.Inside Out is great, firstly because it's Pixar returning to their creativity and profoundness towards their stories, secondly is it's just really smart. It takes a simple idea and sprinkle it with colorful imagination, clever details of its world, totally likable characters, and a really beautiful portrayal of valuing what you honestly feel in life and learning the importance of it. It's a warmer message than it may sound, because that is the true essence of growing up. Everything else is just an engaging candy that would make you laugh, cry and hope. Welcome back, Pixar! The real spirit of Pixar, to be more specific!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Newest Pixar Triumph,"Yeah, okay, it's good; but is Pixar's newest film really that good? Truth is, the worst thing you can say about the worst Pixar films (cough, cough Cars 2) is by comparison they just don't reach the high bar set by Pixar itself. None of them are truly bad artistically. In fact, in comparison to other animation studios, Pixar remains a downright godsend. In that regard, Inside Out is a massive triumph.Riley (Diaz) is just like any twelve-year-old Minnesotan girl. She loves her family and friends and likes to play hockey and goof off when she's not getting good grades in school. Up until now most of her memories are happy largely thanks to the emotions that run her mind. But when her family move to San Francisco those same emotions; Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Anger (Black), Fear (Hader) and Disgust (Kaling) must experience a parallel odyssey in the mind of young Riley.On the whole the idea, while terrifically refreshing, thinly veils its 94 minute run time. This is including a subplot involving Joy and Sadness getting lost in Riley's subconscious and their odyssey to get back to mission control. While good for a full movie, it's much better as an animated short where straining for material doesn't feel too cloying. No matter, for the geniuses at Pixar know how to make things work story-wise using a myriad of psychological inside jokes and kid friendly humor. Having the ""dream factory"" look like a Hollywood studio was a particularly nice touch.Pixar is also deft at making sympathetic characters and the emotions that work Riley's brain and influence her actions are well fleshed out. Its true that each character is meant to encapsulate the emotion they represent but their far from the flat characters I expected. It was honestly one of the most pleasant surprises I've seen in an animated film in some time. Joy probably goes through the largest character change realizing that despite her dour demeanor there is a place for Sadness in Riley's world. It helps that the voice actors chosen are able to convey so much so well.Hang on though, Pixar isn't off the hook when it comes to all characters however. Perhaps it's just the limitations of the high- concept but with all these emotions controlling Riley's head, Riley herself comes off as one-dimensional. The decisions she makes are, well for lack of a better word emotional, and rely on little logic. I'm not saying a twelve-year-old should have an adult's understanding of consequence and forethought but for the most part she was simply reacting to stimuli like a behaviorist's wet-dream. There's little history or experience in her actions other than a hatred for broccoli. Likewise her parents are just flat. The father inhabits the role of the absent father whose busy with work...no new ground broken there, and the mother is just your run of the mill concerned mother too tacit to really see what's going on.Overall, the movie's faults are outweighed by its successes. Its a gorgeous movie that does a great job creating the world inside the head of a twelve-year-old girl. It's said that the animators wanted the emotions to appear like apparitions and not as solid objects. In congress with the playful ergonomics of mission control and the creatures the populate the subconscious, Inside Out is yet another visual threshold the animators of Pixar have powered through.Years ago when Up (2009) came out, I saw a news clip about Disney's irritation with Pixar's toy strategy. They were miffed because no child would ever buy a Carl Fredricksen action-figure complete with a tennis ball adorned cane. I'm sure a few rebels in Pixar giggled but John Lasseter and the executive board likely owed Disney's merchandisers for having a 70+ year-old protagonist. Inside Out offers cute characters who are sure to sell at Toys R Us as will The Good Dinosaur (2015), Finding Dory (2016), Toy Story 4 (2017), Incredibles 2 (TBA) and Cars 3 (TBA). Here's to hoping the future intent of Pixar movies remains telling a good yarn and not selling it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

This is the part when all begins to go wrong and only the two main feelings can help her, if they actually manage to get back to the place where they belong.It's a very sentimental movie which presents the adventures of two characters as they try to find their way back through an endless maze filled with long-term memories. It's mostly sad and suspenseful, contrary to what I was expecting, briefly changing the mood from time to time with a funny sequence. I would have preferred a more joyful movie considering the premise it had, this way making it easier for everyone to enjoy.

Pixar Has Returned!,"For the past couples of years we have worried Pixar was losing it's luster. With the over-reliance of sequels it appeared Pixar was on a road to no longer producing gems but coal. However, ""Inside Out"" proved Pixar's ""gem making business"" is not over yet, not by a long shot.The movie deals with a girl named Riley and her move from her hometown in Minnesota to San Francisco. However, the story is mainly told from the perspectives of her five emotions: Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and Sadness. They all work together to keep Riley normal and work even harder to do this once she moves. However, as is expected, something even worse happens leading to a huge adventure throughout Riley's mind.Pixar has not just created another enticing adventure for us but also an engrossing coming-of-age story. Yes, it is brightly colored and filled with hijinks of epic proportions but in the end this is actually a very intimate story of a girl leaving childhood. We all remember those days when we realized our childhoods were ending, and those days were incredibly difficult.As we grow older we find things changes, some small and others big. And the simple truth is change is scary. In fact, it can be pretty terrifying, and that is what Riley deals with in this movie. This is not some story of a girl being spoiled and throwing a temper tantrum, this is the story of a girl finding everything she ever believed in disappearing.Watching this happen from inside her head makes the adventure all the more thrilling. Throughout the movie we watch as both Joy and Sadness work together to get back to Riley and save her from whatever catastrophe that lies ahead. To do this they find themselves in some very amazing locations such as Imagination Land and (a very inspired setting) Dream Productions.These locations add even more layers to the story being told here. Slowly we watch as Riley goes from a happy girl to a child falling into depression. It is very dark, serious subject matter for a kids movie to deal with. In fact, if it was any other studio I doubt they would've had a chance to tell this story correctly.Thankfully Pixar had this story and they knocked it out of the park. They tell the very simple, yet important, truth that it is important to feel all of our emotions. We watch as Riley numbs herself from the pain of what's happened and that takes her to places she would not have gone otherwise. It makes very complex notions easy enough for children to understand while still maintaining the complexity. A remarkable feat for any movie to do.Of course the movie would not be half as enjoyable if it was not for the wonderful voice cast. Amy Poehler was born to play Joy. It would be very easy to make Joy incredibly annoying because of her perky attitude. However, Poehler finds the right balance to make her very charming. The entire cast was also fantastic. Phyllis Smith was perfect as the downer of the group, Sadness. Of course I cannot forget Mindy Kaling (Disgust), Bill Hader (Fear), Lewis Black (Anger), or Richard Kind (Bing Bong) who were all so wonderful.""Inside Out"" was the return to form everyone has been waiting for. Pixar has always been known for greatness so when they have a story that jumps out even more so than usual, people tend to take notice. This is no doubt one of Pixar's very best features and it will go down as an instant classic. With a wonderful message about feeling our emotions instead of numbing them, ""Inside Out"" goes beyond expectations to create an incredibly mature movie going experience for everyone. Yes, the movie deals with these five emotions, but upon leaving the main ones movie goers will feel will be joy and a little bit of sadness.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
What a marvelous Gem,"I took my granddaughter to see this and dammnit, I want to see it again. It's funny, simply FUNNY. I won't bore you with a recap of the plot as you can see that about a dozen different places on this site. I'll just give you my take, the opinion of a 55 year old guy. I laughed my butt off quite a few times, and when I wasn't laughing, I was a bit misty eyed.It's brilliantly written for every age group and anyone who doesn't appreciate the cleverness that transcends age, gender and species (trust me...)you must be one very dull person. Sorry, but that's how I see it.It shows a situation many have dealt with (moving to a new place and trying to adjust) and even though I've never had to experience that, I've known folks who've had to and this hits the mark. It also hits the mark on the though processes we all face in every day life in a very humorous way and by a wonderful cast.If you're human (or a dog or a cat...wait 'til the end!) you can identify with this and might find yourself saying....I wonder just how much of this might be kind of true.And yeah, as I watched it, I hearkened back to ""Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask"" and numerous similar ""inside the body"" movies.

Yay for Sadness and Emotional Intelligence,"I am a psychiatrist (and mother of 3 young little ones) who has sadly witnessed the devolution of the American emotional intelligence over my lifetime (1970's-present). It is clear that a large sector of the American population (including our politicos) have become allergic to sadness, shunting all appropriate sadness into anger (FYI, the driving force behind these negative reviewers here). Men (especially) tend to be diabolically afraid of sadness and will shunt it to anger. That's why I am so amazed how this movie got it SO RIGHT. The creators must have had a lot of insight and/or input from (good) psychological thinkers. I love the scene with Sadness and the pink elephant -- Sadness listened to him (and tolerated his crying) - yielding his joy. Sadness is cathartic and we are evolved to benefit from this emotion.

The characters were awful mainly because they all looked the same in everyone's head. Jokes were typical... Wasn't that funny either, I didn't laugh much. Plus it's the ""ugh, that character annoys me so much."" type of movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best Disney/Pixar movie ever made!,"Inside Out tells the story of Riley(Kaitlyn Dias). Ever since she was born, Riley has had a great life. She has a loving Mom(Diane Lane) & Dad(Kyle MacLachlan), great friends & she loves playing hockey. Riley's various emotions, Joy(Amy Poehler), Sadness(Phyllis Smith), Fear(Bill Hader), Anger(Lewis Black) & Disgust(Mindy Kaling) help navigate her everyday life. However, Riley's perfect life turns upside down when she moves with her family to San Francisco on account of her dad's new job, leaving behind the life she knows & loves in Minnesota. Now, it is up to her emotions, Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger & Disgust to effectively control Riley's feelings in a new & unfamiliar city.Inside Out is an unbelievably unique & incredible film! Never before in the history of cinema, has a movie ever delved so deep into the various emotions of the human mind. Since this movie is animated, there couldn't be a more fun & creative way to showcase the various aspects of a young girl's mind & imagination. Pixar has created yet another flawless masterpiece. This film is by far, their most original & creative story, yet. Being a Disney/Pixar movie, my expectations for Inside Out were sky high. Despite the presence of emotions like, Sadness, Anger & Disgust, my only emotion while watching this movie was Joy, Joy & more Joy. The animation is of the highest standard. The inside of Riley's mind is colorful, full of life & is a visual treat. The 3D adds to the overall experience of an already wonderful film. Director Pete Doctor is at his creative best for Inside Out. The way Doctor has conjured up this story that mostly takes place in a girl's mind, shows how staggeringly brilliant he is. This film is so powerful that, I actually teared up during the final moments of the film. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of comedic scenes in the movie. The voice acting is top notch. Amy Poehler is a bundle of energy as Joy. Phyllis Smith is perfect as the hilariously lethargic & unenthusiastic Sadness. Richard Kind is adorable as Bing Bong. Bill Hader is hysterical as Fear. Lewis Black is vicious as Anger. Mindy Kaling is awesome as Disgust. Kaitlyn Dias is superb as Riley. Diane Lane & Kyle MacLachlan are great as Mom & Dad respectively. The supporting characters are impressive. Inside Out is a must watch for people of all ages(with a little bit of explanation for kids aged 9 & below). Pete Doctor has really outdone himself after Up(2009). The best Disney/Pixar movie & one of the best animated movies of all time. Inside Out is definitely a lock for Best Animated Film at the Oscars. I wouldn't be surprised if it got nominated for Best Film too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Imensely emotional! Puts your feelings ""Inside Out"" !","The story revolves around the emotional changes that anyone undergoes through their lives. The way the four emotions, Joy, Sadness, Anger and Disgust, have been given a role in bringing out all the feeling is immense. There has been a lot of research done on the subject. The screenplay and storyline go hand-in-hand with each other and produces a fitting ending to the ride of life.Finally, the way they indicate the various emotions in different colors allows children to analyze their feelings easily and co-relate it. The core outcome where every emotion is a part of life is well indicated.Baseline - This movie deserves an Oscar!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar genius,"""Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it is a matter of the will, quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep springs of life."" Samuel UllmanWhile the emotions of a pre-adolescent girl, Riley (voice of Kaitlyn Dias), in Inside Out are depicted in a Star-Trek like control room as real characters, Joy (Amy Poehler) is the Captain Kirk, the major influence in Riley's life so far and at the helm with other players Fear, Sadness, Disgust, and a plethora of memory pods. Riley's had a happy Minnesota life so far with ice hockey and hiking and a much simpler life than now faces her in the family's move to San Francisco.The depiction of these raucous emotions is sheer Pixar genius, a human menagerie of inner players, making sense of the conflicting feelings of a young person, and all of us for that matter. The visuals are stunning, as colorful as has been seen in any other animation, and the big-eyed 'toon characters have distinct personalities developed in a short time.Besides the anthropomorphic emoticons, I am most impressed by the emphasis on memory in fashioning a life. My fear is losing that great gift, for memories form the core of satisfaction with my life, a hedge against mortality if you will. Inside Out emphasizes the primacy of those memories while it also frames the inside fight around the necessity for the conflicting emotions, even sadness as a major player in mental health.Well, it is Pixar after all with its brilliant combination of fun and intelligence, a work of art that indulges the physical and cerebral. All this in an animation—who would have thought except that Saturday cartoons at my local theater helped me shape a loving attitude toward cinema and a career in film criticism? That's my Joy.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pretty good on the Pixar scale,"Featuring a clever conceit and the standard glorious Pixar animation, ""inside Out"" fails to fail like ""Cars 2"" or ""Brave"" but doesn't become an instant classic like ""Monsters University"" or ""Wall-E."" As usual the world-building -in this case the internal monolouge of an eleven- year old girl - yields an immersive and discuss-able experience. It falls somewhat short of, say, ""The Incredibles"" when it comes to snappy dialog or repeatable lines. The fact that line where the character Sadness is told to ""be positive"" and responds with ""I'm positive we're going to get lost"" actually makes the trailer gives you a sense of the weakness of the script. The voice-acting and cast choices are solid if not bold - see Lewis Black as ""Anger"". In short, well worth seeing although you could wait until it shows up on streaming video.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Fabulous Animated Exploration of Human Emotions,"23 June 2015. This innovating, educational, appealing, and emotion-laden animated movie dazzles with a spectrum of delightful and meaningful portrayals throughout its 94 minute running time. Not since Wall*e (2008), Robin William's What Dreams May Come (1998), La Planete sauvage (1973), The Incredibles (2004), or Spirited Away (2001) has there been an animated movie that brings out a fresh, vibrant experience involving deep universal emotions between family members. The movies incorporates of a creative, simplified but reliable look at the brain and emotions and how each one of them, especially those that might surprise many audience members are essential for human authenticity and mental health.What's even more impressive is Inside Out avoids reliance on super special effects to compel the audience to awe and wonder, but rather a playful assortment of imaginative visions that oftentimes Japanese animated movies have been famous for and uses a substantive, meaningful, spirited script to keep the audience entranced with its universal themes of the ties that bind joy and sadness. This is well balanced movie that elicits laughter, sadness, anger, and happiness and all the emotions reflected in the movie without crass marketing manipulation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Mixed Feelings (Pun Intended),"As a long time fan of Pixar's work, I come out of this movie with mixed feelings (pun intended). While I see that Pixar is still far ahead of the competition at storytelling and trying to answer in advance the most random question a little child can have, I feel that we're losing something here.It's the first Pixar movie in a while that's too childish. I found too many scenes in the movie that were developed for easy laughing - it seemed that DreamWorks was haunting the place with canned kid-jokes ready to attack. This was kind of a let down since it's not what we've been waiting for Pixar's movie. In the end, this unexpected irrelevant laughing material might me a request by Disney, to make Inside Out more a movie for *all* ages and not just for +5.On the other hand, the concepts were still portrayed genuinely. Of how we're just a mix of feelings and foundations of our own personality, and that we're constantly changing. Pixar movies tend to deal very well with the sense of loss/sadness and this one is no exception.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Well, Sadness is a necessary emotion, did I just spend 94 minutes to learn that?","I know' this review will be torn to shreds by most of you other reviewers and readers, as this has long turned into a highest praise competition. A competition I can't join, since personally I was sourly disappointed. This movie, is not as original as most of the viewers claim if you really think so go and check out an early 90s series called Herman's Head, in which we saw the story develops inside Herman's head where four characters controlled his behaviour, basically sensitivity, lust, fear and intellect. A much better division than the five almost randomly picked emotions chosen here.But originality is not the issue here, I said more than once that I don't rate originality as is so very highly, and if this was a good story I wouldn't mind a second hand idea and a random choice of emotions. This is not a good story, I find it hard to explain why without adding a spoiler, but I'm willing to explain my point in details to whomever will challenge me to do so by mail or via the IMDb message box. I promise to answer each and every one no matter how many there will be. All I can say here that we do get high drama, with some very inventive ideas and some very high quality performances, especially so Richard Kind and Phyllis Smith, but almost everyone here does the job to the highest standards. And still it all ends with a whimper, without any real resolution taking place on screen. Yes life goes on is a true statement, but it's not the reason we all came to see this movie. Not with all the hype that preceded. And I still think Up and Wall-E were true masterpieces, not just as animation but as movies by any standard. This one isn't. It's an extended pilot to a new TV series where the idea that life goes on would feel right, but then we won't need all this extra drama and meandering plot line.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

It was heart warming, complex, and beautiful. Disney comes with such strange ideas but turns it into something really wonderful.A very good story with originalility, intricated writing and emotional atmosphere. The beginning and ending were great, though the middle was a bit shaky.The characters were well written. You got the 5 emotions, technically they aren't emotions but are like metaphors, you will get what I mean once you see the film. You could see the deep bond between the family and that's why the ending was so satisfying for me. The visuals were fantastic. Character designs, the city, and the mind of each and every person. The music was perfect and really matched with the movie with likable voice acting.Overall a very enjoyable film.

Surprising Dramatical heft with limited laughs,"Is a kid's movie that is incredibly moving and thought provoking still successful if its only mildly funny? Came into this one with pretty high expectations due to the eye-popping reviews and it was the first film I brought my niece and nephew too. If you have seen my top movies of 2014 lists, then it is apparent that I can really appreciate animated movies, with The Lego Movie being my #2 favorite movie of that year. Would Inside Out be this years Lego Movie? or the bigger question, would my niece Henley be able to sit through a whole movie? Inside Out is an inventive story that follows a young girl Riley and her emotions; Joy, Rage, Fear, Sadness, and Disgust. She is a seemingly happy girl with her family up in Minnesota and with Joy (Amy Poehler) at the controls of her emotions. There are bowling ball looking spheres that represent memories; gold for joy, green for disgust, red for anger, green for fear, and blue for sadness. With Joy leading the way of all the emotions, most of the spherical memories in Riley's mental inventory were a pure gold, including the core memories that helped create thematic islands that represent Riley's life. Then within a blink of an eye Riley gets uprooted from her life in Minnesota and moves to San Fransisco. All the emotions panic and Joy's joy is shaken for a split second for the first time before she gains composure and tries to put on a smile during a bad situation.As you can tell so far the story and idea are incredibly clever, and the execution was nearly flawless, but the big missing piece for me was the humor. The laughs for me were sparse, which was even true for my 3 year old niece, and 5 year old nephew. Spoiler: Brecken enjoyed the movie while Henley couldn't sit still, and even if she was sitting still, all the worth while themes would of probably flown over her head, but we still had a great time.Once in San Fransisco, the fight gets real for Joy and the rest of the emotions to make Riley happy. Joy loses control though of sadness, who keeps touching memories which makes these joyful memories into sad memories. In the middle of one of these scruffs of joy trying to keep memories from sadness, they both get sucked out of the emotion headquarters and into the long-term memories. With joy gone and unable to help Riley's emotions, the happy and loving girl fades into a disgusted and fearfully angry girl, mainly towards to her parents (like so many of us did when we were kids). Riley, on the inside and out, slowly falls apart into an emotionally numb pre teen. This is actually a pretty dynamic and long plot for a kids movie so with specifics to the plot that's where I'll leave you.When Joy is out trying to get back to the headquarters and throughout, Inside Out becomes an allegory that hits pretty heavily on some weighty issues regarding emotionally numb teens due to adults expecting you to always be happy, or just over medication of our kids. This works remarkably well and the emotional heft of this animated movie is pretty remarkable because this is a tremendously heavy and important topic it is hitting. Anyone who's grown up, which is everyone, really can relate to Riley and the battle of feeling like you have to be happy all the time even when there are times for sadness and how those mix of emotions can be a beautiful thing.While Inside Out may of been lacking in laughs, it is more than successful in provoking deep thoughts and pulling at the heart strings. Younger kids below 7 or 8 probably will like something like the minions more due to its more obvious humor but for those looking for surprising dramatic heft, Inside Out is for you.

Possibly the greatest film ever made,"A big claim, yes. But for me, personally, I'm not sure I can fault this movie, or think of any better.I am 50, and have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember. Over the years I have tried all sorts of treatments, and read a lot about the condition, including actually studying clinical psychology, in my quest to better understand the demons that plagued me.Never have I come across a better depiction or description of the depressive condition as I have experienced it, than is contained in this film. It explains the darkness in a light way that enables me to see the truths it contains without the feeling of horror that I usually feel when encountering any such depiction in fiction, and has a message that is not only hopeful but practical.I cannot recommend it too highly for anyone with similar problems, or for people who know depressives and want a bit of insight.

For them it might be very useful for all involved to ponder the points made in this clever movie but for most people it'll just be mildly entertaining.Despite all that the movie is getting rave reviews.

"Inside Out, Upside Down or Sideways, Pixar's Latest is An 'Emotional' Thrill Ride!","It's old hat to call a movie an ""emotional thrill ride,"" but in Inside Out, it's literally true, as the abstract concepts of our minds prove to be the perfect playground for the Pixar pixelators.The opening scenes of Inside Out skillfully introduce the characters while generating a sense of joy at the wonders of the world, as a little girl named Riley is born in Minnesota and starts to grow. But unlike other animated movies, Riley is not the hero of the film. The principal characters are the primary emotions in her head: permanently buoyant, yellow-hued emoticon-Tinkerbell hybrid – Joy; fiery red, pugnacious, his fuse as short as his sleeves – Anger; bespectacled blue blob beneath owlish spectacles – Sadness; chic, fastidious and disdainful green - Disgust and a bow-tie wearing purplish bag-of-nerves with startled eyebrows that levitate above his head - Fear. Together they guide Riley's feelings from a knob-laden control desk, processing her new memories as they arrive at the Head-quarters, each memory looking like a glowing bowling ball and colored according to mood. Some of her experiences become important, influential long-term memories and are stored as color-coded orbs; others are dumped into the vast wasteland of forgotten experiences.In the idyll of childhood, it's the ever ebullient Joy, naturally, who takes the lead at the console. But childhood bliss cannot last forever. Riley is uprooted from Minnesota to San Francisco when her father takes another job and the turmoil of the move to a new home leaves Riley coping with everything from living in a less-than-desirable neighborhood to missing her friends to feeling like an outcast at her new school. Things are getting complicated inside Riley Central! This soon triggers a crisis as a control-room malfunction leaves Joy and Sadness stranded in a vast allegorical geography of Riley's mind-scape. And so begins an odyssey through her psyche, as they traverse such wonderfully rendered obstacles as a library of memory banks and an imaginary friend - unbearably tragi-cute Bing Bong. Can Joy and Sadness make it back to headquarters in time, before a dejected Riley runs away from home?Emotions run wildly funny in this exceedingly original story. But what's most brilliant about the Inside Out is how director Pete Docter not only connects beautifully to those emotions but turns them into his characters. The story takes us outside Riley's mind and into the real world just often enough for us to appreciate what she's going through. It's all done with a deft touch. Working with a multi-layered story and a sparkling voice-cast, Inside Out comes with a surprising amount of depth, resulting in a film that is not only delightfully entertaining, but also thought-provoking and very much emotionally-complex.Pixar has always been great at coaxing our eyeballs out of our fat heads with awe-inspiring visuals and vibrant colors, but Inside Out is undoubtedly the studio's most impressive piece of eye-candy yet. They outdo themselves with vast, intricate, amazingly detailed landscapes ranging from the ""movie studio"" where Riley's dreams are produced every night to the places where Riley's subconscious and abstract thinking reside, all brimming with sparkling visuals. The running gags are all delicious (don't miss the end credits) and keep flying in thick and fast.Fittingly for a movie set inside someone's head, Pixar's latest is a fireworks display of fizzing ideas and bursts of imagination.

Mind Set,"(Rating: ☆☆☆ out of 4)This film is recommended.In brief: Insightful and thought-provoking, but not as mind-blowing as expected.GRADE: BCritics have been raving about the latest Disney / Pixar offering, Inside Out. While it doesn't take one to the dizzying heights of animation perfection like the award-winning Holy Trinity of Animation (Toy Story, Up, and Ratatouille), it still is entertaining and insightful, far better than most standard animated films these days.￼Literally, the moviegoers are given a introspective tour into the mind of an 11 year old girl named Riley. This fantastic voyage takes us into the brain's central work station manned by Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (lewis Black), and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). This quartet of emotions help keep Riley in balance.That is until Riley's outside world starts to come undone with real-life issues changing her life. Inside, things are beginning to disintegrate as well when Sadness accidentally starts a domino effect that alters Riley's behavior and mood swings. (The fact that Riley is headed for those teenage angst years doesn't help matters either.) So Joy takes over to try and rectify this imbalance causing even more issues.￼Well directed by Pete Docter and co-directed by Ronaldo Del Carmen, Inside Out is animation with adults in mind. The screenplay by Meg LeFauve, Josh Cooley, and the director, takes an intriguing premise but never fully succeeds in expanding its mind games. And while the intentions are good, the end result is a bit scattered. With all the language about core memories, deductive reasoning, and abstract thinking being bantered about, one wonders if a psychology major is required for the minors in the audience. The film's target audience may have been children, but only those with the highest of IQ's.The voice-over work is consistently strong, especially Poehler, Smith, and Kaitlyn Dias as Riley. However, while some of the emotions are well defined like Joy and Sadness, the other trio is regulated to secondary roles that are less nuanced. Other major emotions are never even represented or acknowledged for that matter. Paging Sigmund!￼The real scene stealer of the film (in Freudian terms, our Id) is Bing Bong (wonderful vocal work too by Richard Kind), a pink confection of cotton candy and various animal parts who cries candy tears and was once Riley's imaginary best friend. This character is the heart of the film and the emotional center of Inside Out. The film laments the loss of childhood in the subtlest of ways and effectively taps into any moviegoer's emotional ""core"".￼The film's animation is as highly accomplished as we expect from the Disney / Pixar Studios. Its textural details and imaginative Rube Goldberg devices show the inter-workings of a child's mind with its floating islands, glowing orbs, and neon lit chutes and ladders...a Disneyland for the mind. Its stylized humans have enough realistic touches to make their characters seem authentic especially in sharp contrast to the cartoon qualities of the more obviously color-coded crew. The musical score by the talented Michael Giacchino superbly links its haunting melodies with the visual images on display. It is also refreshing that this film never resorts to inane slapstick chases and sophomoric humor, so prevalent in today's animation.￼Inside Out shows the ins and outs of growing up in a refreshing and intelligent way in which adults can easily relate while their young children will pass the time wondering why their parents are enjoying the film more than they are.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

One of the best by Pixar Studios. Watch it for the concept execution and brilliant detailing!!,"Inside Out comes across as a very successful attempt by Pixar studios on a very audacious plot. The movie took me by surprise by the sheer creativity that went into every single detail of the story. It is a very difficult movie to execute and Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen pulls it off amazingly well.The story takes a look into various emotions (joy, sadness, fear, anger and disgust) of a young 10 something girl who is brought to a completely new neighborhood and culture - from MidWest to West Coast.At a higher level, it shows how our emotions play a very important role in our reactions to day to day situations, which is why controlling them becomes all the more important for long term happiness. I loved the boldness of the concept and the imaginative power that went behind writing the script.The animation is not as great as Pixar's earlier movies but does enough justice to the general benchmark of animation quality that has been set these days.However, overall, the movie is a great watch for the sake of the brilliant plot and brilliant imagination that has went into creating this amazing movie.

Yet another Pixar masterpiece,"Greetings again from the darkness. Once upon a time  in 1995 to be exact  Pixar revitalized and revolutionized the world of animated movies with the release of the first Toy Story. In the process, they sent our expectations soaring for each of their subsequent movies. Despite the pressure of such high standards, the creative geniuses at the studio have regularly thrilled and delighted us over the years with classics such as Cars (2006), Ratatouille (2007), Wall-E (2008), and Brave (2012). And beyond these, there have been a few true cinematic masterpieces – transcendent films: Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Up (2009), and Toy Story 3 (2010). This most recent release unquestionably belongs in the latter group  it's one for the ages (and all ages).Genius and brilliance could be used to describe all aspects of this movie. It's a technical marvel, a visual kaleidoscope of bright colors across the full screen, and most amazingly, it packs an emotional wallop with real life moments for adolescents and parents alike.My comments will be brief because this is one you should experience for yourself – and probably more than once. Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is an 11 year old girl who lives in Minnesota and loves her parents, her friends, and hockey. She is happy and well-adjusted. When the family relocates to San Francisco, broccoli on the pizza is only one of the challenges Riley must face. This change affects everything for her – no more friends, no more hockey, and a strained relationship with her parents. At this point, you are probably saying ""So what? That's nothing we haven't seen before."" And you are correct, except we have never seen it explained the way Pixar does.We literally go behind-the-scenes of Riley's brain and see the control panel of her emotions. There is a constant battle between Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling), Anger (Lewis Black), and the ring-leader Joy (Amy Poehler). This is an exploration of emotions and memories, and the explanation has some scientific merit. Memories are depicted as marbles, and Riley's favorite things are shown as islands (Sports Island, Friendship Island, etc). How emotions affect memories is the key point here, and especially how sadness is necessary and vital to our joy. Have you wondered why we forget our imaginary childhood friends (Riley's is Bing Bong, voiced by Richard Kind)? Have you wondered why our memories change over time, and are impacted by our emotional state in any given moment? This animated gem will help you understand.Director Pete Docter (the genius behind Up) has a daughter of his own, and he clearly ""gets"" the emotional changes brought on during the pre-teen years. His research, and that of co-director Ronaldo Del Carmen, takes us on an adventure that should inspire much conversation between parents and kids. And even if it somehow doesn't break the ice in every family, it will at a minimum help youngsters and parents better understand the link between emotions and memories  plus, they will probably share a good cry and a bunch of laughs along the way. Hats off (again) to the Pixar geniuses. I dare you to top this one!***NOTE: you should also look forward to another Pixar tradition – the pre-movie short film. This one is a very unique short entitled Lava.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Misses the mark with me.,"I did enjoy ""Inside Out"" more today than did I did the last time I watched it. So, it is growing on me. That said, it still misses the mark. It's just too weird to be a truly satisfying experience. A lot of it comes off like a stoner movie. I have a hard time connecting with the characters. Although Sadness gets her share of laughs, she's mostly pretty annoying. I know a lot of people really enjoy this movie. I know that it's heart is in the right place.

A bit Self-Indulgent on the part of Pixar Employees,"Originality: 0/10. The whole ""personality attributes as characters"" thing has been done to death at least since ancient Greece. That being said, originality is not necessary for entertainment (eg: pretty much all Disney classic animated features, Shakespeare,...)Appeal to kids: 0/10. None of the characters speak or behave ""kid"". They're adults. Making adult quips and using adult language about adult topics. Even the environment wasn't ""kid"".Appeal to tweens: 2/10.

Magical,"I currently have a top-rated comment on Youtube that bugs me every few days as new people like it. I was giving someone flack about calling Inside Out the best Pixar film since Toy Story 3, because that doesn't say anything. So its better than Cars 2 (universally held to be the worst), Brave (the most forgettable) and Monsters University (a prequel that didn't exactly evoke any wonder). Inside Out is a magical film experience and it deserves higher praise than that. The unreachable pinnacle on which Finding Nemo and The Lion King sit now seems so much more attainable.The voice cast of this film is utterly delightful - Amy Poehler is beyond perfect as the perpetually optimistic Joy. Her voice has been making me smile for years and now it does so in a whole new way. The rest of the cast - from Lewis Black's Anger to Phyllis Smith's Sadness - matches perfectly with their character's design and body language. It doesn't even feel like voice acting, I believed that these were actual creatures who had thoughts and were speaking to each other.The film's screenplay is an utter delight and I would have to say for the first time I will be outraged if it is not a front-runner for Best Original Screenplay. The beautiful crafting of the emotions and their dialogue to the clever (and utterly believable) bureaucracy that makes up the emotions centre. Sprinklings of meta-humour (the unicorn standing in for a famous actress), nostalgia (the imaginery friend), one-liners (there's deja vu! and blah blah! and deja vu!"") and more adult themes (Riley's return home at the end of the film) show perfect levels of balance and utterly sensational writing quality.There's not to much more I can say without just listing a bunch of scenes I enjoyed, so I'll keep this one short and say that Inside Out is magical. Its one of the best Pixar films of all time, and its great to see they can still make me ask ""what if?""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar reclaims their title as the best in the business,"Inside Out does have it share of small problems, such as a lack of development for some of the supporting cast and a bit of second-act fatigue. However, these hiccups don't really detract much from the overall thematic thrust and inherent brilliance of the material itself. The script is endlessly inventive and insightful in a way few films are these days, and the voice actors are at the top of their game here, especially Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith. Although Inside Out may not quite be the studio's masterpiece, the film is certainly among its finest work (and the best since Toy Story 3 back in 2010). More importantly, Inside Out officially puts to rest any doubts that Pixar is still the king when it comes to delivering meaningful, imaginative family entertainment.

It is a totally family movie. The movie teaches bonding, friendship, honesty. While entertaining, Inside out also teaches the meaning of Life. This movie definitely deserves an Oscar.

Could be a 10 if the logic wasn't wrong from the start,"This movie has a great potential and it was supposed to be a 10 out of 10 movie if it didn't make a terrible mistake about the logic consistency. The unclear and inconsistent relationship between the characters and their inside five emotions really mess up this movie.The five emotions inside all the other characters other than Riley are literally themselves-same kind, personality, gender and age with the characters, and they interestingly display the process of thoughts and emotions before they show their feelings, say and do things. For example, the insides of Riley's parents, the girl who sells the pizza, and even the cat and dog on the street all follow the same rule.But Riley's inside is a total mess. The relationship between Riley and her inside five emotions doesn't follow the same rule. While other characters inside emotions interestingly display the process of their thoughts and emotions, Riley's emotions are not Riley herself, as they come before Riley. They are older, they have two genders, and their personalities have nothing to do with Riley. When Riley is still an infant, they are already young kids who try to take care of Riley. Instead of being Riley's emotions, they are super nannies who babysit Riley and make sure she is psychologically and physically well. They are also Riley's commanders and Riley is their puppet.In addition, instead of being the process of Riley's feelings, they are the cause of Riley's feelings. Riley starts to act weird not because of things at school, but only because her Joy and Sadness are accidentally missing. What's worse? Even this inconsistency couldn't be consistent. It's a total mess and feels very wrong from the start.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"""Do you ever look at someone and wonder, 'What is going on inside their head?'""","The human mind is a complex labyrinth of mental processes, conscious and unconscious thoughts, emotions, memories, and more. It's a muscle that's always working in complicated ways to ensure our survival in day-to-day interactions, and for human beings in particular, this extends to emotional well-being, socializing, rationalizing, communicating, and more. Few people, if any, fully understand how the human brain fully works; it's just always there, and the voices in our heads are always there to guide us through life. With Pixar's film Inside Out, filmmakers cleverly interpret neuroscience into a whole new universe where emotions are characters, memories are objects to be stored and used, and their interactions are what cause people to act the way they do.In spite of the premise, the film definitely employs some imaginative world-building, featuring visually fantastic scenes where a person's mind is a surreal fantasy world akin to Alice in Wonderland (which in itself could be interpreted as a mental thing anyway). Within the mind of one little girl, there are ""personality islands"" that represents Riley's values; there's a literal ""train of thought"" that appears; there's a zone where ""abstract thought"" turns the characters into literally abstract figures; there's a film studio that makes dreams; and so much more. It's a clever way to translate what we know of the brain into literal places that are visually impressive and sometimes funny. What brings the mental landscape to life will be the characters though - the interaction between all the emotions creates plenty of hilarious comedy between themselves, and causes people to react in funny ways too. Altogether, the movie is just as cute, funny, and imaginative as Toy Story and Monsters Inc. were.The story has two different narratives working for it. On one level, it's the simple story about Riley, the girl who has to move from rural Minnesota to San Francisco, and has to cope with all the stress of leaving behind home and living in a new place. In her head is where the bulk of the film's adventure takes place, in which Riley's Joy and Sadness both go missing and have to find their way back to headquarters before the other emotions mess up Riley's life for good. It's a pretty lightweight story on both accounts, with subtle levels of conflict. What makes the film compelling will be the characters, both external and internal. It is consistently fun to watch the emotions, for even though they are one-dimensional, their personalities clash and react in dynamic ways. Thanks to their relationships, Riley and her family are brought to life in a perfectly lovable way as well. Their struggles are struggles that we can all relate to though; the film underscores the turmoil around life changes and maturity that we all face at some point, and through those fundamental conflicts, the film reaches an emotional resonance as the characters straddle the threshold of maintaining psychological stability.This film is crafted with top-notch animation quality. It's a bright and colorful film with plenty of imaginative designs. Lighting, textures, and rendering are all great. Movements are very lively and smooth. In some areas, it is genuinely impressive as to how big in scale some of the settings and locales are. Voice-acting is great from the whole cast, the writing is good, and the music score is appropriate.Inside Out is cute, funny, and pretty clever, much like the other films Pixar is best known for. It deserves a look.4/5 (Experience: Good | Content: Good | Film: Good)",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Both Overrated and Underrated by Reviewers,"This movie seems to be getting reviews that are very high and others that are very low. I'd rank it on the higher side. It's one of the better Pixar movies that has been released, but I'm not sure I'd call it one of their best movies ever released.The movie stars Riley, a 12 year old girl from Minnesota who one day out of the blue has to move to San Francisco for her Dad's new job. The five emotions in her brain aren't sure how they should react to this and instead there is a battle for the control panel for how she should respond. Leader Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), tries to keep her happy, while Sadness (voiced by Phyllis Smith), normally content with staying in the background, wants more control. This leads to both Joy and Sadness being sent via a tube to the depths of Riley's memory, while the other three emotions Fear, Anger and Disgust (voiced by Bill Hader, Lewis Black and Mindy Kaling respectively), must try to get Riley through each day in her new home full of unfamiliarity.If you watch the special features, Writer/Director Pete Doctor admits that they struggled for a while to come up with a story to fit along this theme. Watching the film closely, you get that vibe throughout. It almost feels like an incomplete film. We don't get to know Riley all that well besides some scenes here and there where we see that she loves her friends, family, hockey, goofing off, and being honest. The movie has the challenge of creating conflict without a true villain. This is a great change from the usual Disney fare, but also ends up putting together a story where the obstacles aren't that overwhelming. The themes of ""it's OK to be sad"" and ""emotions aren't cut and dry, but mixed"" are great lessons to learn, but too many times I felt I was watching ""Herman's Head"" or a story that just needed a couple more things to make it more interesting and not so bland and flat.The characters are just not that likable. The parents are standard Mom and Dad, who have a very generic relationship with Riley. Joy is annoying, but so is Sadness. However, I found the three other emotions enjoyable because we didn't see them as much, so when we did, they did a good job at comic relief, etc. Bing bong, the imaginary friend, is probably the best character in this whole movie as a reminder of the imagination we have as kids and how the older you get, the more it fades away.I like the lessons the movie gives, the animation was beautiful, the soundtrack was wonderful, and it has moments of brilliance, but at the same time there were too many moments where more could have been added to flush out the story and give it more of a unique twist and make it not so paint by the numbers. I still think it's one of the better Pixar movies, but not one of their best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Refreshing view of the mind that's delightfully entertaining,"As a studio whose films established benchmarks in animation technology, Pixar has also set a precedent in refreshed storytelling with some deeply emotional and philosophical undertones. In its most audacious attempt at that and in the extraordinary league of 'Up' and 'Wall-E', Pixar now gets behind the scenes of adolescence in the most imaginative way possible with Inside Out. Directors Peter Docter ('Up', 'Monsters, Inc') and Ronnie Del Carmen create a wonderfully animated world of the complex human mind with stunning details of notions such as islands of personality, dream studios, imagination land and the headquarters. Riley is 11 years old and so far, Joy has successfully managed to be her dominant emotion. Until she moves to San Francisco with her parents.Born in Minnesota, Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) excels at ice hockey, has a close friend and is loved by her equally goofy parents. These aspects of her life form her personality and special memories leave a lasting impression in her mind. Her father's business prospects move them to San Francisco and that's when their dreams of being in the beautiful city by the bay slowly start to crumble with a typical house that is on the verge of ruin. Riley must also struggle at school as a newbie without friends while coping with anxious parents who are already troubled with financial woes. While all of this happens on the Outside, the emotions in her head are actually animated characters who have the job of maintaining sanctity in Riley's personality. Joy (Amy Poehler) is vibrant, positive and just... happy. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) has her depressing way of seeing things and is somehow inspired to touch all of Riley's memories. Fear (Bill Hader) is obsessively cautious about Riley's each move, thus keeping her safe while Disgust (Mindy Kaling) brings out the sass and disapproval of things and people for Riley. Then there's the newspaper reading, head scorching, easily agitated emotion of Anger (Lewis Black) that basically entertains the viewers. Through their combined efforts, memory, in the form of orbs roll into the headquarters with most of them being the color of Joy. The special memories outside, become core memories inside that are safeguarded meticulously. Her personality traits outside form islands of personality inside which look more like intricate theme parks that connect to headquarters via a narrow bridge. Dreams are created in the dream studios whereas the imagination land houses the odd and mysterious fantasies that are temporarily created by Riley. Then there's the literal train of thought that chugs all around and the pit where discarded memories lay.What makes Inside Out so enjoyable is its depiction of such complex mechanisms of the human mind, simplified in the most artistic manner that can relate to some kids but all adults. So much so that the manifestations that are created by Riley, such as the adorable Bing Bong are merely a part of her growing up. Adults will relate to such themes and the emotions felt by them will perhaps be the opposite of what their kids would feel. An impulsive mistake by sadness sucks Joy, herself and Riley's core memories through the duct that throws them around the islands. In their absence, the headquarters falls in disarray, thus reflecting upon Riley's behavior. She turns cold, aloof and decides upon things she might regret later on. Joy and Sadness have to take whatever help they can get in order to get back to headquarters before it is too late. But the mind is a complex arena of cryptic lanes, creative studios and fantasy characters that won't make the return of such vital emotions easy.Peter Docter has visualized a very human story that each of us can relate to. If 'Up' was all about not letting go of a life that's dear to you and believing in it if there's nothing to lose, Inside Out shows the lighter side of how the growing up stage works inside a child's head. The emotions aren't battling it out for supremacy in the mind but are actually playing their own little parts to keep their human from struggling in life. Riley couldn't let go of her past self and adaptation was a challenge she simply couldn't overcome but with Joy at the control center of her mind's headquarters, she was in good hands. This is Pixar's return to form and perhaps the most important film to watch this year while superheroes and monsters from the past grab your summer's attention. The animation is ground-breaking once again and not because it is state-of-the-art but because it exploits the potential of such art for a compelling story that couldn't have been depicted in any other way. You will fall in love with all the characters especially Joy, Sadness, Bing Bong, Anger and Riley herself. Brilliantly conceived and adroitly directed, Inside Out is a must watch.9.001 on a scale of 1-10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Imaginative and insightful,"I may be going out on a limb here, but it's probably safe to say that ""Inside Out"" is the first mainstream animated feature film to be entirely centered around a seriously depressed child.The reason Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) is so depressed is that the personified emotions - Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black) - that are responsible for keeping her psyche running smoothly have been seriously flubbing up of late. So much so that Riley runs the risk of experiencing a full mental breakdown if the emotional team can't retrieve all the core happy memories from Riley's childhood that are rapidly slipping away.Imaginatively conceived by Pete Docter, Meg Lefauve, Josh Cooley and director Ronnie del Carmen, ""Inside Out"" takes place in two entirely distinct realms: first, in the ""real"" world, where a young girl has been dragged by her well-meaning but oblivious parents (Kyle MacLachlan, Diane Lane) from Minnesota to their new home in San Francisco; and, second, in the complex inner workings of said child's brain - a place filled with personality islands and memory balls all operated by the aforementioned Emotions from a giant console.Rare for a movie aimed primarily at children, ""Inside Out"" is psychologically astute in its observations about human nature while remaining fanciful and childlike in tone and attitude. It explores the things that really matter to a youngster who's suddenly been yanked from a world where everything is comfortable and familiar to one where everything is unsettling and strange. The movie also points out how even the most well-intentioned of adults often fail to take into account children's very real feelings at crucial moments in their lives.On a technical level, ""Inside Out"" comes replete with all the visually stunning graphics, fast-paced storytelling, and outstanding voice work that we've long associated with any computer-animated feature produced by Pixar Studios. But it's the less tangible elements of heart and imagination that truly count in this work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

They took an example of how the emotions work in the brain of a girl until her teenage years. It will teach you that every emotion is important, even sadness. Because it is OK to feel sad sometimes, get it all out. You have to have a balance. The fact that it is an animation movie does not mean its (only) for children. But I think that this can be a beautiful way to teach children (and everyone really) about emotions! I think it was about time that they dare to make a animation movie like this.

Inside Out revives Pixar!,"This film focuses mainly on Joy and Sadness. They obviously have opposite personalities and it is quite interesting to see how they react to each others decisions.

I had really lost hope in them after watching Cars 2 and Brave. I went into this movie expecting it to be about as good as Brave, but was shocked to see a Pixar film that was actually very entertaining. I now have hope in Pixar again and am anticipating 'the Good Dinasaur' next year.The short that played before the film (Lava). Was actually quite interesting. I do not want to spoil anything so lets just say its an adorable little story about a volcano that includes a song.

"A great film for adults (and some kids, I guess)","Normally, when I take my ten-year-old daughter to the cinema to see a 'children's' movie, I normally just sit there praying for it to end as it's just a load of colourful sentimental nonsense designed to fill an hour and a half's time. My daughter, and most of those who are around her age, all sit there laughing and enjoying the film. I just want to go home. This is because – naturally – children's movies are aimed at children (no surprise there then!) and, as an adult I have to accept that and just go along with it. That was until I saw 'Inside Out.' Here the film seems to be written the other way round. Yes, I loved it. I had a great time during the screening. And, although there were plenty of colourful characters for my daughter to watch, I didn't really think that she (or 90% of the under elevens in the audience) really appreciated it.We're shown that, right from birth, we have little characters in our heads controlling different areas of our personality – a happy little character for 'joy,' a depressed little character for 'sadness' and so on. These quirky little creatures control and dictate our actions and therefore life throughout our lives. The little characters we meet here reside inside a little girl called Riley's head. And, when she moves house and her life gets turned upside down, the little people inside her mind go on an adventure throughout her body – in particular various aspects of her mind.And this is where things get a little complicated. Well... not for me, but then I'm an adult. However, some – in fact quite a lot – of the gags start to fall flat on the children's ears when the characters on screen walk into the 'subconscious' and you're treated to the 'horrors' which reside buried deep in all our minds. And this is how it went on. More and more of the story seemed to be designed for those with a least a better understanding of the way our minds work that your average 'Pixar-watching' child.I've read other reviews and I see that a lot of kids did actually enjoy this film. However, I just wonder on what level they did? My daughter loved it, but the characters were pretty and 'good' was easily distinguishable from 'bad.' Personally, I loved Inside Out and would happily watch it again. I thought it was clever and different. I also couldn't help but think I was watching some sort of Christopher Nolan film like 'Inception.' Adults will love it. Kids should love it.

Very average,"A Pixar movie, like the rest, I had great hopes paying the cinema price, rather than waiting for it on Sky in 12 months, but when you hear rave reviews, it usually means hype to compensate.

Manages to be complex and smart while still fun and charming,"Inside Out is Pixar at its best. It's an engaging idea that takes on pretty complex subjects and turn them into a fun ride without dumbing them down, but actually subverting them into humorous situations (and of course there's the heartfelt and tear inducing moments we came to expect from the studio's features).In the film's world, every person has inside their minds 5 emotions: sadness, joy, anger, disgust and fear. Each with its own personality and desires. They also habit the ""world of the mind"": there's the cave of the uncunscious, the islands that defines our personality, a fantasy world and etc. The creativity put into this film is so great it reaches both adults and kids without having to recur to subtle profanity to get adults wry smiling or pushing an overly cute character to get smaller children giggling.The five emotions that live inside the girl Riley have to deal with everything she goes through in life, but these things assume other forms inside her mind and its so curious and exciting just seeing how her memories, desires, relationships, nightmares, expectations and all kind of experiences take shape in this inner world and are dealt with.What truly makes Inside Out a great movie is the amount of subtlety in each situation and character. For example, the fact that Joy is yellow but also has blue hair (the color of sad). The way it shows us that each emotion is essential and part of life and how the whole time they interact with each other making our existence confusing but at the same time so rich and complex. The movie wittily materializes and personifies things that goes inside us that we may find sometimes hard to explain and gives us a whole new and imaginative view on how we feel and think - and it does that with remarkable simplicity and inventiveness.Inside Out will probably have a sequel (maybe more) and that's a great thing in this case, because the whole idea is so intriguing and full of possibilities. After seeing this film you may actually start imagining these characters rambling in your mind and talking over each other.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Great fun, often creative, but also a bit plastic and dumbed down at times","Inside Out (2015)Totally fun, with some semi-serious analysis of how our brains work for a kid to absorb. And heck, maybe some adults, too. The story of a girl adjusting to moving to a new city and a new life is layered with a fanciful view of psychology. It's good stuff.I didn't find it as mind-blowing (so to speak) or inventive as many seem to, having read a few reviews out there. The clichés here are expected and almost necessary (the types of people playing aspects of personality, for example). So that's fine. But the larger story of adjustment is painted in very ordinary ways, hitting the usual trigger points without much creativity. I'm not talking the in-the-brain stuff, which is totally great in a Bugs Bunny kinds of great crazy way, but the outside story.I also don't really like this kind of animation—it's not as cartoony as, say, two of my favorites, ""Monsters Inc."" and ""The Incredibles,"" both by Pixar. And it's not over-realistic as some animated/CGI inventions are (from ""Avatar"" to ""Polar Express""). So the characters (the daughter and her parents, mainly, but everyone, top to bottom) are kind of plasticky fake/real. The personalities also have that Disney kind of white-washed blandness that seems quaint on the surface but is empty and predictable and a bit off-putting at the same time.I enjoyed this movie and it would be hard not to. And maybe this kind of children's film, or young adult film, should be aove serious criticism. But if it does warrant critique, and comparison to other animated features, it falls short. That's fair enough.Finally, it does have some totally brilliant moments, especially when it shows the insides of other people's (and animal's) brains. Notice how the audience really (and finally) comes awake and laughs with a roar at this! Now that's great filmmaking.

From the Inside Out it is all Pixar,"We all are victim to our emotions, always susceptible to a tantrum or sobfest that overruled our logical side. The trigger for these outbursts can vary in form, a bad day at school, a breakup with a boyfriend, or in my case sitting through bad movies. Whatever the cause, have you ever stopped to picture what is going on in your mind to cause this? Pixar has, and their latest film has brought those thoughts to life in a way only their studios can. Today I review Inside Out and take a look at what creative sparks lie in their studio.Pixar has been on the sequel train for quite a while, so I was thirsty for a drink from the original pool. Inside Out emerges from that source we fell in love with years ago, and brings it back ten fold in the world of young Riley's (Kaitlyn Dias) mind. Inside Out is a beautiful personification of the inner workings of the mind, filled with colorful visuals that pop off the screen. A high tech ""head""quarters for the cortex looks like something from Star Wars, where futuristic control panels govern all the memories and thoughts that govern our being. Outside command central, Pixar gives you more of their magic in their creations; forming a maze for long term memory, a movie studio as the source of your dreams, and an obvious train for your train of thought. Tacky as some of the puns are, Pixar puts their wit back into the game to design a unique world that is sure to entertain many, as well as become the next theme park attraction.As the emotions transverse the chaos that is our brain, Pixar not only takes you on a physical adventure but an emotional one as well. Of course being a kids movie there are a lot of comedic moments that had me, as well as other audience members, laughing. Slapstick humor involving bodily harm, one liner puns that will appear in memes, and plenty of witty dialogue that represents the internal struggle of indecisiveness. In particular Anger's (Lewis Black) ranting had me laughing the hardest, as the simplistic yelling and rash threats to curse were to my tastes. Sadness (Phyllis Smith) had to be my second favorite, more so in how she presented her lines with that perfect twist of depression to make it funny, and yet sad at the same time.Yet while comedy is a big portion of this movie, Pixar/Disney always manages to bring other emotions into the mix. Seeing as one of the emotions is Sadness, you can guess there are a few moments that can bring tears to your eyes as Riley's memories unfold before your eyes. Joy offsets these moments though, with beautifully crafted sequences that cover those special times in life. And all of it is edited together at just the right times to make the emotions hit home, building slight tension, but delivering a satisfying finish. Pixar represents this emotional instability both inside Riley's mind and outside in her actions, really capturing the look and feel of someone troubled, hence the title. It's balanced well with the humor, and gives older audience members a tether to the film to keep their interest.Voice acting though is the factory that really brings things to life, as each emotion is matched with their voice counterpart. Poehler's optimism shines bright in joy as she rambles off her ideas to keep Riley happy, and you can feel the actress in the character. Phyllis Smith brings her character to life, her whispy voice selling the hopeless emotion, and yet still bringing a comedic edge to her lines that made her humorous. Lewis Black is perfect for anger, his ability to play heavily angry roles where his character consistently yells has been established, and he fits right at home with the emotion he plays so well. Mindy Kaling as Disgust was another good choice, the shallow, image obsessed emotion playing strong to that sassiness we love from her. And Bill Hader cleans up with fear, bringing the anxious tone of fear, while also providing that dry sarcasm.For all the good this movie has there are a few quirks that took away from this movie. The first is a few of the jokes are beaten to death and lose their comedic intensity. In addition the trailers have also given you a lot of the funny moments, which for those who are heavy Disney watchers will be lost from the constant barrage of commercials. As a movie overall, Inside Out has some decent editing, but there are times where the editing needed to be tweaked. The ending of the movie was very drawn out at times, and lacked suspense for me because of the obvious ending to come. I would have liked them to sacrifice some of the prolonged and slower scenes, and give us some glimpses at the personality islands they kept bragging about, or perhaps more time in the darker recesses of the mind. Diving into that creativity may have offset the predictability a bit, and played to the strengths of this movie more.Overall I was impressed with Inside Out and loved to see Pixar's classic performance shine once more. Audience members of all ages are sure to enjoy this film, with the younger generations laughing in high shrills and the older appreciating the emotional side of things. It holds that creative magic we love of Disney, and keeps you entertained despite some of the longer moments. While not the best, Inside Out certainly shows promise for the studio's future works and more fun adventures to be had. I would say it is worth a trip to the theater for any age group and strongly recommend you see this film.My scores are:Animation/Comedy/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Imaginative animated flick about what goes on in your mind,"Released in 2015, ""Inside Out"" is a Pixar animated movie about the goings-on in a girl's head as her family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco and she considers running away. The movie depicts emotions like Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust scrambling around to help the girl make the right decisions.I'm not the best person to appraise flicks like this because I don't typically watch animated pictures, but this one interested me because of the creative plot; I wanted to see how the filmmakers visualized the happenings inside a person's mind. In some ways it's reminiscent of Dr. Seuss and ""The Wizard of Oz."" In any case, it's imaginative and entertaining. I love Anger and I wanted Joy to knock Sadness off one of those cliffs. Bing Bong is a cool (goofy) character as well.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
You can control your emotion for a bright future.,"This is an animated family movie but I recommend it for every adult.This movie teaches us that everybody can control their emotions. Even if you feel anxious and hopeless, you can change it to positive.If you change your mind, your behavior would change.If your behavior would change, the future would change.And one thing I learned the important fact from this movie is that kids would get so much stress because transfer school to another city.So parents had better think so well to move to another city with kids.I love this story.

Inside Out: A Masterpiece of Emotion,"""Inside Out"" is a masterful animation film that tells the story of a young girl's inner emotions as they navigate through her mind. The film is visually stunning, with intricate and imaginative depictions of the different emotional worlds. The voice acting is superb, with each character bringing their own unique personality to the table. The story is heartwarming and thought-provoking, tackling complex themes of growing up, family, and the importance of emotions.

Educational and entertaining,"Equally educational and entertaining, Inside Out evokes deep feelings while examining the importance of those feelings. Centered around emotional personifications in a young girl's head, the film follows her adjustment to moving across the country. Joy is the lead protagonist, but she learns plenty about the value of Sadness. Meanwhile, Inside Out depicts abstract concepts like memories, imagination, and the subconscious as literal objects and locations. This is both uniquely fun and substantially informative. Also, the voice acting clearly portrays each emotional state. Undoubtedly, Inside Out will captivate with its plot and linger with its messages.On a technical level, Inside Out is proficient. The Pixar animation is premium, with vivid textures and detail. The production design is also a highlight because its literal representations of the mental world are distinctively whimsical yet instructive. The cinematography isn't overtly stylish but conveys meaning through POVs, lighting, and colors. Furthermore, sound has dramatic silence at climactic moments, editing cleanly weaves between internal and external realities, and the soundtrack reflects the delicately bittersweet mood. Plus, the direction smoothly redefines difficult emotions with a positive tone. Overall, Inside Out is an artful presentation and an enlightening experience.Writing: 10/10

A delight for children and adults alike,"This is such a great time for kids' movies that, if you don't have children or grandchildren, you need to borrow or steal a youngster or just go along anyway. For this one, my wife and I were fortunate enough to have her great niece (nine) and great nephew (seven)- thanks, guys.Children's animation does not come much more inventive and challenging than ""Inside Out"" from Pixar, the studio that gave us ""Toy Story"" and ""Up"", and director/writer Pete Docter, the man who worked on these earlier achievements. Most of the film takes place inside the mind of an 11 year old girl called Riley who is suffering from her parents' move from Minnesota (where Pete Docter grew up) to San Francisco. Her emotions are brought to life by five colourful characters called Joy (yellow), Sadness (blue), Anger (red), Disgust (green) and Fear (purple). The moral of the story is that, for a young person facing a new environment (indeed for all of us), it's tough for Joy to keep all the other emotions in check but it's OK to be sad sometimes.Visually the movie is a treat: as well as the five emotions battling over the control deck in Riley's mind, there are five Peronality Islands, the Subconscious, the Train of Thought, and endless multi-coloured balls representing memories to be stored, sorted and lost. The brilliance of the film is that there is lots of humour for the kids but plenty to think about for the adults. Its success with both critics and audiences seems certain to augur a sequel based around a mysterious button which has emerged on the control deck called Puberty.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Emotional Rollercoaster: A Masterpiece in Animation,"""Inside Out"" is a vibrant, imaginative journey into the mind of an 11-year-old girl, where emotions take center stage.

He's liked it so much, he has now gone to see it 3 times since its been on at the local cinema. So what do I know!

Fortunately, I did not have to pay extra as it was on the STARZ channel, which is part of my TV package.It is beautifully ""drawn"", the speech and lip movements are wonderful. But I found it confusing and depressing. All those different colored balls rolling about, and the blue Depression was definitely annoying. I feel sorry for parents who had anticipated being able to take their children to see ""Inside Out"".

The movie has not only touched in many aspects of the emotions and how they impact our decision-making process, but it has also come up with a beautiful way of illustrating how memories are affected by the emotions and how, consequently, it impacts our personality.I cannot recommend this one enough - I have watched it over 10 times and I'm still baffled by the conclusion and the meaning of it to the public.

Another Pixar Classic,"Wow, some real sad sacks here complaining how this movie isn't funny and is too complicated and scary for their toddlers to watch.

This isn't a Pixar movie for toddlers, or really anyone under 12, but is much better suited for early to mid teens or really anyone over 12 should find it entertaining. I'm not going to say how unbelievably far past 12 I am but I will say that I found it a hoot.A simple premise that has been given depth and complexity that isn't dumbed down too much for the toddlers.

Pixar's return to work,"The saddest animation I've watched in recent years, Pixar's return to work, # Cannes Film Festival #, received thunderous applause during screening. At first, I hated Sadness the most, but in the end, I understood her the most. The original sound, Bundle of Joy, was so beautiful. The scene of Bingbang made me and the American girl next door cry like dogs. The sadness was that if I had several small islands in my mind, some of them should have been destroyed and wouldn't be repaired. The ending Easter egg is great. When one day we shed tears for happy memories, the feeling of tears in a smile is growing up. Essentially, it's just a children's story, but Pixar's imagination is breathtaking, especially in constructing a witty yet rigorous and orderly world of imagination. After reading it, I really want to peek into everyone's mind!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Unsung hero that is Sadness,"Definitely a tearjerker for any age. It is a fun family film but with so much depth. Kids will enjoy it for the character as emotions and the colors of the world inside Riley's mind. However, adults will like it because it has a hidden message for all ages, but probably more so for adults than children. I believe it is a secret movie for adults because of the hidden message. The message is it's not healthy to keep your sadness bottled up inside. If you ignore sadness, you might go into depression which is what Riley goes through. This was out in 2015 before everyone else preached mental health awareness. This was probably a first hint maybe it's a good idea to let out your emotions to heal your wounds.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A very fun way to understand how the brain works,"This film tells the story of a group of people in charge of emotions and memories in a girl's brain, who struggles to make the girl happy because chaos breaks loose inside the brain.The trailer makes me want to watch it because it looks so much fun. Putting people in charge of the various functions of the brain, especially emotions, is very interesting. It provides many people, especially children, a fun way to understand how the brain works! The story is very fun, and I really like the concepts like abstract thinking chamber and the train of thought! ""Inside Out"" is very interesting because it presents many aspects of brain activity in a fun and vivid manner.

I loved the idea of those marble memories,"Pretty great Pixar movie, good for kids of course, especially the middle part with Joy trying to get the core memories back to headquarters, but pretty great for adults too.The story follows Riley, a young girl uprooted from her peaceful life in the Midwest and forced to move to San Francisco when her father starts a new job. We enter Riley's mind as she struggles to adjust to her new city, school and home life. Chaos ensues at ""headquarters"" where new emotions have set up shop. Joy tries to keep things positive but anger, sadness and fear have made an appearance and core memories are being destroyed.I loved the idea of those little marble memories and have thinking about that for days now, it just makes so much sense. As an adult I found this movie thought provoking and sad (imaginary friend Bing-Bong is a bit heartbreaking), as you realize the losing of innocence we all face.Its Pixar so of course kids will love this but this one in particular is pretty great for adults too",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Definitely Pixar's greatest comeback.,"The best I've seen by them since Up and Toy Story 3. This is probably considered, if not the most, one of the most clever films they've made thus far. A very unique story about the inside of a persons brain in a creative and imaginative fashion. If you know the basics of Psychology, then this film is better understandable. Joy was a really fun character, Anger and Fear were easily the most comedic, and Riley was very sweet as well. Maybe not quite as much of an instant classic compared to some of their other films, but a lot of the credit for this one goes to the clever ideas and of course, to Pixar's usual charm also.

Growing up is not easy.........,"Great movie from Pixar that takes you inside Riley's head with the basic emotions as she goes through major changes in her life. The emotions are especially recognizable for many people, how they ensure that we sometimes react this way in a situation. I sympathized with Riley throughout the whole movie. You really going to love her.The only negatives in the film I found:her parents' reaction when Riley was absent during dinner. Everyone could see that Riley was not herself and upset except her parents, her father even sent her to her room and her mother didn't say anything about his dumb reaction.the stupid actions of sadnessthe choice to end the friendship between Riley and Meg. Making up after a argument is part growing up too and moving to a new state does not mean goodbye to ypur old friends for good, I thought this was a disappointing choice by Pixar.But overall a very good emotional film that I recommend to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Maybe the IDEA is not bad, but the movie is a disgrace","I don't really side with the reviewers that say the idea of a movie like this would be lame. Because honestly, there'd be nothing better than taking your kid to see a movie that makes them think about how they work. Bright colourful visuals, lovable animals inside our head in a big mind world. It could have been so cool. However, this movie has NONE of that. It makes your inside of your head look like a stupid office worker's counter, what gives?If this were done in the 90s, we would have had a HUGEEEEEE story about jaguars and cheetahs and fish and stuff in our mind. Showing kids just how BIG you are inside, and how your gears that operate you are big things. Not some boring set of plastic characters. Plastic referring to the term from Mean Girls (it's a Lindsay Lohan movie, see it if you don't know the term ""plastic""). The emotions all look like plastics, especially Joy. There's a way to 3D model a character in a movie to have a proper kid movie physique. Joy looks like a plastic anorexic. What with all the slang and annoying sarcasm bratty attitudes too. You want your kids seeing that? Back then in a Bug's Life, our kids got to see Princess Atta having a normal girl's figure, Dot her little sister actually had kiddy cheeks, this main girl character in Inside Out is a PLASTIC. PLASTIC I TELL YOU.She gets into the biggest plastic arguments with her parents, I never did that nonsense and no one from the 90s did that stuff. Typical mean kid with a cell phone. The day animated movies FROM PIXAR FOR GOD'S SAKE, have the main character being like 12 with a cell phone? Cell phone when you're under 30 would have been bad back in the 90s. Heck I think even at my age you can't have a cell phone without your mother poking fun at you.This ties back to another point, that animated movies now are using humans as the characters. Why? What did animals ever do to you? Clearly these movie makers now are not from that era when we had beautiful characters like Mufasa, Woody, Sully, Hopper, etc. Where are the villains in this movie? Where's the Kevin Spacey acting? Where's Scar? No one cool? Just some miniskirt plastic punching the dinner table and upsetting her parents? I never did that stuff. Humans as main characters in animated movies DO NOT usually make good film material.Not to mention the whole movie was ridden with high school references, typical plastic stuff. It was so boring I luckily was there when it was on at home, I could just leave the room while the other's watched. Never show this to your kids. It makes them think their world is microscopic and its ran by desk clerks. The ""emotion"" characters really aren't funny or likable, they are NOT cute like Dot from a Bug's Life or Boo from Monsters Inc, they SUCK. And the whole ""I'm a teen so I don't talk to my parents"" thing was forbidden before. Now it's the main subject of the movie? Makes you wonder what this movie maker looks like who made the movie. What the heck are they? Hoodlums? I don't know.You makers need to take a pen and jot down full essays about what makes Lion King so good, Scar so menacing. Kovu from the second Lion King so cool, what makes Heimlick funny from a Bug's Life, what makes Zee a hero from Antz, the list goes on. Such a boring offensive movie. There's so many adult themes I've left out.Trying to turn our beautiful wide eyed hyper children into antisocial desk clerk emotion hormone teens that don't talk to their Mommy and Daddy anymore.

Yes- children will love its simple cartoon characters. An adults' film? Yes, too- snappy dialogue, clever witticisms. With cross-references or hints of ""Wizard of Oz""; a bit of Woody Allen cynicism; a dab of office life antagonism; cubist art analysis; family tensions; and a heap more. I've seen it four times now.

One of the Greatest Movies of our Time,"Contrary to those who believe that Inside Out was a movie for ""12 year old girls"" or a complete disappointment or even Disney's worst production, I believe that Inside Out was an excellent movie in that its mastery of presenting real life topics (the role emotions play in our perception of memories throughout our lives) in such a way that children are able to grasp the ideas. Now before I continue I want to make it clear that while I am writing a positive review, I am NOT a mom or dad. There are many reasons as to why I believe that Inside Out was a success and not, as some would say, a failure. 1. While there are many other emotions besides anger, fear, disgust, joy, or sadness, the latter are the most common emotions present when we reflect upon memories. You wouldn't say ""Oh, that was a desirous memory or exciting memory"" you would be more likely to describe it as a happy or joyous memory. Also, if any one of the haters bothered to read the Trivia section about the movie, they would know that 27 other emotions were considered (surprise, trust, and pride were among those that were cut) but settled with joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger to make it less complicated for CHILDREN 2. This movie was made for kids. Thus, that is why there are no ""adult"" themes. However, to say there were no adult themes present would be saying that the idea of emotions, the occasional struggle to sort your emotions or memories, does not apply to adults which is simply not true because this notion applies to the young and old. 3. Inside Out presents the idea to young children that it is okay to express your emotions, that our memories will not always be joyous, but that they will not always be sad. Yes, there were some minor flaws within the movie, but to say that the writers and directors should be fired and never again be allowed to set foot on a PIXAR (this movie was a Disney PIXAR movie, not a Disney movie--they are two different things) set is ridiculous. Not every movie that Pixar has made has been a success. Every production company is bound to experience failures, that's how we learn what does and doesn't work, but in order to succeed one needs to take risks. And those who believe Inside Out to have been a complete failure need a wake up call because that's what this movie was..a risk. It was a movie that explored themes, topics, and issues that no other Disney or Disney Pixar movie had dared to do. And to compare it to Pixar's many other movies would be unjust and unfair not only to Inside Out, but to those other movies because each movie is its own, with different themes, and different topics.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An instant classic!!  My favorite Pixar film by far!,"Wow! Inside Out is outstanding in every way! It's so smart, of course kids will enjoy it, but adults will absolutely love it too! It also features hilarious moments, mostly involving Joy and Sadness, who were amazing on screen together! The concept was executed so well, all the aspects of the mind, how dreams are made, everything was so creative and never seen before. The voice actors are perfectly cast! Phyllis smith cast as sadness was spot on! And of course Amy pohler stole the spotlight as Joy. The movie at times was also very moving and heart felt, I found myself close to tears at one point. I thought Pixar really out did themselves! This is my favorite Pixar film of all time! I found myself having belly laughs through the whole thing, along with tears at other parts. Disgust and anger and fear were also very well made, and featured very funny moments as they try to function when joy and sadness are missing. This movie really just leaves you more than satisfied. I was actually sad when it was over, that's when you know a movie is truly fantastic! 10/10 there wasn't a single flaw in the perfect movie! :)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

This year though, they may have their most emotional picture yet in the form of Inside Out and this time, it's all about our emotions showing emotion.When young Riley and her family move from their quiet midwest life to the hustle and bustle of San Francisco, Riley's emotions; Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Disgust (Mindy Kaling) and Anger (Lewis Black) go into overdrive.Together they have to work to make sure Riley adjusts to life in a new city, house and school.As always with Pixar, there is much more to their films than first meets the eye. The story may sound very basic however, when you watch Inside Out, one of the most impressive things about it is the sheer amount of imagination that has gone into making it such a special film.The world that the animators have created inside the mind of a child is one of Pixar's best pieces of work yet and everything single one of the emotions fills it with their unique personality.There is some good voice work provided by the likes of Poehler, Smith and Black but it does feel that both Kaling and Hader are a little underused however, not enough to make their characters pointless.The script is full of brilliant comedic moments, allowing Black's Anger to steal most of the scenes, and touching scenes that have Joy, Fear, Disgust and Anger wondering what the purpose of Sadness really is.It is such themes as this and the script that makes Inside Out arguably Pixar's most accessible animation to both adults and children. If you thought the final scene in Toy Story 3 or the opening to Up tugged at the heartstrings, wait until you see Inside Out.If Inside Out is one thing, it is undeniable proof that Pixar remain the leading animation studio in Hollywood. A title they have been holding now for the past twenty years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Sweet movie on growing up, making memories and dealing with change","Riley is an 11 year-old girl. We see her growing up and how her inner thoughts and emotions develop and control her, especially her memories. These thoughts and emotions are represented by miniature versions of her, and live in their own little world, controlling Riley from behind a console. Everything is going well and Riley seems to be leading a blissful, uncomplicated existence. Then she and her parents move home, from Minnesota to San Francisco, and the bottom falls out of Riley's world.Sweet movie on growing up, making memories and dealing with change. Funny, fun, emotional and reasonably clever. Had the potential to be incredibly profound and intelligent but pulls its punches in that regard. While it does touch on some interesting aspects of the human psyche, it doesn't really explore the subject deeply. Instead we have silly chase scenes and the like.I guess the problem is that the movie's main target audience is children and an illuminating, deep exploration of human thinking and emotions would be too complex for them.Overall: enjoyable, with some good intellectual and emotional moments, but uneven, as these moments are interspersed with bland, even silly, adventure-type scenes and plot-lines.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Emotional but yet Satisfying,"Inside Out is a Pixar film which we rewatched before checking out the sequel. We loved this one, the story is about a young Riley who is dealing with various emotions after the family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco.

Riley is voiced by Kaitlyn Dias and her inner emotions Disgust is voiced by Mindy Kaling, Joy voiced by Amy Poehler, Fear voiced by Bill Hader, Anger voiced by Lewis Black and Phyllis Smith as Sadness. The storyline surrounds Joy trying to control Riley's emotions and to keep her happy but Sadness keeps changing the core memories, but sadness also means to cherish and to love. Kyle MacLachlan plays the dad, Diane Lane as the mom, and Richard Kind as the imaginary character Bing Bong.

Important movi,"It's hard to describe how straight to my heart this movie has gone. I'm genuinely impressed about how Pixar managed to describe the outstanding complexity of emotions management in such a poetic, moving and funny way. The depth of the movie is obviously very difficult to grasp for children - and that's not even the goal - but as an adult it resonates in so many way. The main messages is that negative emotions (captured by Sadness) are normal and necessary, and how we need to let them express in order to grow.I also loved how growing up is described by a more matured and complex way of managing emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The struggles she faces are universal, making her story relatable to anyone who has ever experienced change and uncertainty.One of the most powerful aspects of ""Inside Out"" is its message about the importance of all emotions.

Dives into a deep bittersweet nostalgia that's impossible to resist.,"Everyone agrees Pixar have been in a slump since Toy Story 3, their best work in their 20 years of releasing feature films. The Cars sequel was the most prominent evidence that they're a business that wants money. While the first is enjoyable for what it is, I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes of number 2. Brave was a complete misfire, structurally incompetent, painfully unfunny and I haven't been able to watch anything Scottish since. Their Oscar leaves a sour taste on the category. However, I am a staunch defender of Monsters University, a film that may follow pleasant kid formula for the first breezy two thirds but develops into a heartfelt lesson of perseverance in its final act. I can't argue that it wasn't a necessary film. Now they're on the rebound, a take 2 on an original property with a female focus and at least we can say that the Pixar the public and critics love whole- heartedly is back.I'll admit, I did criticise Inside Out at first. The designs and concept felt more like branding fit for Happy Meal toys than developable characters. I sold the studio short though, as further successful marketing promised more insightful and funnier observations. They have a noble quest for this generation in giving them a visual perspective on not only how they feel, but how others feel. It fits firmly in the Pixar family. Inside Out marries the vast adventure of Finding Nemo, the character frictions of Toy Story, the lovable bureaucracy of Monsters Inc. and the wistful emotion of Up. You can start to feel Pete Docter's directorial stamp and his personal touch feeds into a film that could have felt far too committee lead. Here they go back to their roots as it's their most cartoony movie yet with characters more Elastic than Elasti-Girl. You can feel all the animators having fun with some scenes such as the maybe-too-clever Abstract Thought sequence.Of course, the story does suffer from it's manufactured trappings. When you set all the rules, the story never feels completely organic as the writers invent all the resources to solve the character's problems. They use the Pixar beat sheet favourite of coincidences getting the characters into trouble too liberally here that you can predict when things will fall apart and like Finding Nemo, it can feel too episodic. Instead, you can call it a testament to how they can reign in their unbridled creativity. Those bumps in the road are easy to overlook when you have splendid visuals, brilliant sense of humour and a wonderful lead like Joy, a Tinkerbell-esque pixie sans the mean streak that makes you want to conjure her in your own mind right now. Amy Poehler is perfect casting, reprising the endearing optimism of Parks and Recreation's Leslie Knope for the big screen. Pixar once chose movie stars, now they're keen on how many eyes are back on TV, recruiting The Office favourites Phyllis Smith and Mindy Kaling for other emotions along with Bill Hader and Lewis Black.They're wise to not make them as one dimensional as their names suggest. Joy's main concern is Riley's happiness and collecting as many yellow memories as possible, but in order to do that it takes a selfish sense of control to the disregard of other emotions, such as frequent party pooper Sadness. Her arc is the most compelling and dimensional, while the other negative emotions supply her journey or provide very humorous gag material. However, Inside Out will always be notable for giving Richard Kind his due. He's played very small bit parts in many of their prior features but here he finally has a role to win over our hearts as the imaginary friend Bing Bong. The film hits its emotional crescendo in its crisis point thanks to Bing Bong and Joy's crucial revelation. At its best, the film is very powerful, tapping into a tender deep-rooted nostalgia for innocence lost. As a result, the inevitable resolution feels greedy, wringing tears out of us because it can, leaving out the music so you can hear other sniffling audience members. At least it's not a forced moment, but the film already hit its peak by then.That doesn't take away what it does in the meantime, embracing the complexities of emotions and where they can lead if they're allowed to be balanced. It does have a similar issue to Toy Story 2 where it peters out near the end, falling short of a few promises, not going the extra mile like Monsters University did to our pleasant surprise. It's almost too light. But despite its flaws and necessary contrivances to make it work, this is clearly a film that kids today will carry with them until adulthood, peeling back its identifiable layers as they get older, and that generational importance is easy to appreciate. Hopefully more important to them than Frozen. While it may not be as good as their 1995-2004 output (save A Bug's Life, though that's not bottom tier), I prefer it to their acclaimed 2007-2009 trio. Let this be the beginning of a new hot streak.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Inside out,"A creative and innovative approach to one's mind.Although this film I feel like doesn't really live up to be a masterpiece it's still a great film. I think we all as kids had this idea of our mind but this was the first film to really capture that idea and create something wonderful. The story is engaging and touching at times but also it's a bit boring when there's something constantly in the way out of the headquarters. There's a point in the movie where it's just boring to watch Joy and Sadness struggle, I feel that they extended them being stuck a bit too much. The movie shows mind development, how people go from simplicity to complexity and the downsides of it, it also really captures what change does to you really well.

Too Cerebral without an Entertaining Enough Story,"Just based on the movie, it deserves a rating of a 4 or 5 but I'm giving it 6 stars because of its intellectual aspect.I was so excited to see this film. I missed it in theaters and didn't get to see it in 3D so I'm not sure what that would add to the movie. I am a Pixar lover but this one was a major disappointment. On some levels, the movie is amazing and the writers obviously did a lot of research and carefully laid out their story - so much to the movie is brilliant. How what is happening inside of Riley's (the main character) brain and how it affects what she is doing ""outside"" is seamless. The sections of the brain like memory and imagination are wonderful. The whole aspect of how suppressing emotions affects us is great. However, while the representation of the inner workings of the brain in a fun way that is accessible to children was exceptional, it didn't translate into an interesting story. (By accessible to children, I mean even if they didn't understand it, they wouldn't be confused by it either.) The story is just OK, a bit boring actually. The goal of the movie wasn't to be a laugh-fest but I also didn't get the emotional connection needed to sustain it either. Also, the cast was great.I still give a major kudos to Pixar for attempting such a layered film with so much potential. Intellectually, I appreciated the effort of trying to give us a children's movie with so much depth. Unfortunately, the end result was mediocre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Where is Wisdom?,"I am sitting here watching this animated nightmare with my niece who seems to like the movie. I asked her; ""Is that it?...is that all the emotions they are presenting to you? Where is wisdom? Where is faith?"" The film is disturbing as it presents no magic to being a kid. It seems to play a lot on getting down in this world and reacting with anger and fear. Joy tries to rescue the mind but is being manipulated by outside forces trying to be goofy but lost in deception. I am not sure what this film is trying to suggest. I recall as a kid I use to have two characters in my head, little aliens, one good and one bad. They would do battle but good would win out each time. Yet, the little manipulative one would sometimes disguise himself as good. Yet, wisdom would come into play and I would send both aliens out of my head. Is Disney being operated by a cult?

"Very creative but,","Inside out was one of my favorite movies as a kid and now rewatching it it was good but not as good as a remember,Now do not get me wrong this movie is VERY good the idea of it is very good and the emotions thing is very very good and creative.The voice acting is very good I really liked bill hader's character and mindy Kalings's voice acting , bill hader did a very good and memorable performances and Mindy's personality in her voice perfectly suits the Disgust character.Joy is a bundle of sunshine in this movie while sadness is the opposite while there might be a logical reason for that some of the stuff that she did in the movie was quite annoying and stuff but overall good characters.Now the MAIM things I didn't like about this movie is the second act and so on ( spoiler warning ) when Joy and Sadness were launched outside of the headquarters and they go into the long journey to find their way back , now I would've preferred the movie to go normal like just the emotions controlling Riley and such but it wasn't that bad , now thr SECOND thing and this one kinda frustrated me a bit and it is sometimes in the movie something very unlogicsl to happen IRL happens in this movie and newsflash the movie talks about IRL and the things that are not logical is where Riley decided to just simply ANONDEND her parents and just straight up goes back to Minnesota, and yes that gets explained in the movie but like that's so unlogical but eh whatever.Overall the movie is very good and I liked it , while it has some problems overall it's a very enjoyable sweet movie and I liked it

There wasn't a focal point because everything was watered down. Things seemed to be done arbitrarily.

There's something magical about these contemporary Disney/Pixar classics, the way they paint and explain life, both to children and to adults.

To be honest, you don't realise you're happy until you're sad. There's no Joy without Sadness, and I love the role that it had at the end. The perfect ending.I can't wait to watch the sequel, as I foresee the same amount of emotion and tears, possibly more.

Brain fodder for kids,"Not the kind of film I usually go to see, but saddled (I mean ""blessed"") with my partner's children (5 and 7) on a rainy afternoon in Sussex, this seemed an easy option.

I think they were less dazzled by it than I was: no shoot- outs, no explosions, no witches and wizards.Most of the voices were unfamiliar to me (including Riley's and all the Emoticons) although I recognised Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan as Mom and Dad, and Frank Oz in a bit-part. The voices hardly matter: what matter are the visuals and the storyline; both are cleverly conceived and cleverly executed.

A Modern Pixar Masterpiece,"Literally my favorite movie ever. Gosh were do I even start with ranting about how amazing this movie is? First of the casting is perfect.

Phyllis Smith as Sadness, Mindy Kaling as Disgust, Lewis Black as Anger, and Bill Hader as Fear were all matches made in Heaven. And Amy Poehler should voice act more often because she absolutely killed it! Easily the best cast of any Pixar movie. Second of the animation is phenomenal. I adore how ethereal and abstract it looks, arguably the best 3-D animation of any Pixar movie. Third of the world building. I know every critic and their mother has said it but this movie is so incredibly unique and as an HSP who is all about emotions it's right up my alley. Fourth of the story it managed to make cry, tense up, and laugh in under 2 hours. And the message of accepting your other emotions in order to be happy is still really unheard of even to this day.

"""Inside Out"" is wonderfully original and incredibly imaginative, but unremarkable in some areas.","The mind is a complicated, confusing, contradictory place. But it's also a unique mix of emotions, memories and thoughts which make each of us who we are. Wouldn't it be interesting to actually see how all that stuff between our ears works? Interesting, but also helpful and even cathartic. And, potentially, a lot of fun too. Those are the ideas behind the animated comedy-drama ""Inside Out"" (PG, 1:34) from Pixar Animation Studios and Walt Disney Pictures.Riley Anderson is a human being (well, an animated version of one anyway). More specifically, she's an 11-year-old girl, but that's almost beside the point. Her gender and her age have a lot to do with how her emotions cause her to think, feel and behave, but the movie makes the point that the way her mind actually works is driven by the humanity that she shares with all of us. Her feelings are controlled by the interplay of five main emotions, each personified with their own physical characteristics, their own hue and their own role to play in her life. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler) is a yellowish sprite who keeps Riley's spirits up – and is Riley's ruling emotion. Disgust (Mindy Kaling) is a green, eye-rolling fashionista who protects Riley's social life, Fear (Bill Hader) is purple and nebbish and protects Riley from physical harm, while Anger (Lewis Black) is a stocky, red munchkin who protects Riley from unfairness in her life. Last and least is Sadness (Phyllis Smith), a short, round blue figure in a turtle-neck sweater who doesn't really seem to have a purpose. Somehow, these five work together to achieve balance in Riley's emotional life and help her function on a daily basis.In living her life, Riley makes memories in the form of glass-like orbs. Most of these memories (each orb literally colored to show which emotion is dominant in that memory) roll down tubes into the massive storeroom of long-term memories. The most important memories, those that really define Riley's life, are core memories which reside in the ""control room"" of Riley's mind and power her islands of personality. 11-year-old Riley has five such islands – Goofball Island (she is a kid after all), Hockey Island (reflecting her favorite pastime), Honesty Island (her most significant characteristic), Friendship Island and, of course, Family Island. But as a complex human being, that's not quite all there is to it. Her mind has areas for imagination, facts and opinions, abstract thought and dream / nightmare production. She also has a vast abyss for memories that are no longer important and, working in that warehouse-like archive of long-term memories, a couple ""Forgetters"" who decide which memories to keep and which to discard. Each area of Riley's mind is both necessary and dangerous, but I won't say more because seeing how Pixar has imagined and animated each of these areas is a large part of enjoying this movie.As great an idea and as wonderfully realized as it is, this movie wouldn't be much without a good story – and this film definitely has one. After we see Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) form many wonderful memories (most of which are contained in orbs colored yellow), she is removed from the place where those memories were created when her parents (Kyle McLachlan and Diane Lane) move the family from Minnesota to San Francisco. A delayed moving van and a tenuous job situation stress out her parents, while the normal adjustments of leaving behind friends and starting in a new school has Riley's emotions working overtime. Tensions rise among the emotions until a struggle between Joy and Sadness result in both – along with many of Riley's core memories – getting sucked into a long tube and out of the control room. As Disgust, Fear and Anger are left to run Riley's mind, Joy and Sadness have to work together in a wild and strange journey through her brain, trying to get back to the control room, before the other three emotions mess things up too much – and before Riley loses her way. As Riley's personality islands begin to crumble into her mind's abyss, Joy and Sadness learn that they each have much to learn about themselves and each other and they have to figure out new ways to work together, for the sake of all concerned. In addition to the inner workings of Riley's mind, we get a glimpse into the minds of each of her parents and minds as diverse as those of a birthday party clown, a bus driver, a pizza maker, a dog and a cat.As advertised, ""Inside Out"" is wonderfully original and incredibly imaginative. If you're having trouble picturing all this, try to imagine a colorful, animated combination of ""Fantastic Voyage"", ""Mermaids"", ""Toy Story"", ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""San Andreas"". Yeah, it's kind of hard to explain, but trust me, it's quite a sight – and pretty thought-provoking too. Unfortunately, I can't quite turn myself inside out praising the movie. The voice acting is very good, but nothing special. The animation is state-of-the-art but isn't what I would call ""remarkable"" and is probably not worth the extra couple of bucks for 3-D glasses. The film contains very funny and genuinely touching moments, but they are few and far between. While the filmmakers have clearly put considerable effort into realizing their vision, more effort should have gone into the actual script. The concepts explored are a little cerebral for a kids' movie, while the dialog isn't cerebral enough. In short, the film is hindered a bit by a lackluster script and unremarkable animation and voice work, but deserves high marks for its creativity and, in that department, definitely lives up to its billing. The main emotion that ""Inside Out"" activated in my mind's control room is Joy and this film will live in my long-term memory for many years to come.

Inside Out,"Quite bittersweet to be watching this in 2024 for the first time. Inside Out is a typical Disney film that the studio used to churn out on a consistent basis. Funny, wholesome and most importantly, empathetic. Yet these are qualities that have seemed to disappeared in the past couple years. It is so easy to empathize with Riley as all of us feel the same emotions everyday, and developing a story with the 5 emotions is such a joyful ride that harkens to other Disney blockbusters. For me personally, this is more like a typical Disney film that I can enjoy with the kids, but it's not as emotionally powerful as my other favorites.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Do you find joy in hitting yourself on the head with a two by four, because you know that eventually the pain will stop, like when you pass out? We watched this thing and got two, count 'em two laughs. Not belly laughs, not guffaws, just mild chuckles. The rest was a harrowing, bewildering slide down into the depths of despair while trying to comfort children who were showing more and more signs of emotional distress. A waste of time and a waste of the talents involved.It just plain sucks.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another great movie from Pixar,"Inside Out is a movie about human emotion, specifically during prime years like it is transitioning to your pre-teens. Riley is taken away from the world she knew, to start a new life.As a kid, we don't get to make decisions, we're drawn to the decisions of our parents. Riley finds herself in a position where she wants to make her parents happy by being happy and joyful herself, and joy makes a real point to sadness in this regard. This movie is a major lesson for all ages, we're human. We have feelings, it's okay to feel sad, to feel angry, to feel fear, to be disgusted. At the end of the day, is being able to communicate and express those feelings in a safe environment with people that genuinely care and want to be there for you. That's where true connection arises. That's where true relationships form and build upon.I think it's a great movie for children, we don't spend enough time talking about human behavior and emotion, specially to children. For them to be able to understand where feelings come from and why certain behaviors come up, is a tool that will stay with them as they develop into their teen years - a really difficult development stage. I loved this movie, really great representation of the human brain, great job from Pixar. This movie has so many inside stories that an adult will pick up upon and develop and really fun scenes that will make kids laugh and have a great time. Highly recommend it!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

One of Pixar's Finest and Most Emotional Creations To Date,"Pixar is known for creating films packed with creativity and imagination. Their concepts are nothing short of exciting- What if Toys had emotions? What if Cars had emotions? But what if emotions had emotions? Sounds weird. Well, let's get into it.Inside Out is a about an 11 year old girl named Riley who is approaching the stress and storm period of adolescence which itself is a turbulent period. One day her family decides to move to San Francisco from her hometown of Minnesota. What follows is a wild ride of different emotions (literally). Inside her head is where most of the story takes place as we are introduced to our five core emotions- Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) who are incharge of Riley's emotional state. Joy is the leader of the group who is incharge of making Riley happy everyday. But things take a wild turn after Sadness tries to take control and everything starts going downhill.The writing here is extremely clever as it so flawlessly balances it's comedy with such hard hitting emotional moments. This movie perfectly captures what it's like to be a child and when you grow older you tend to forget all those happy and fun things you did as a child. It also shows how suppressing your emotions and not letting others know how you feel might lead to depression. Everything about the storyline and writing is freaking brilliant.The visuals are quite impressive and stunning. The way they portrayed the designs of the Emotions and the surrounding environment of the mind from The Headquarters to the Personality Islands from Imagination Land to The Long Term Memory is a wonder to behold. The voice work is done brilliantly with Poehler as Joy, Smith as Sadness and Black as Anger being the standouts.With a touching story, strong message, stunning visuals, fun characters and a lot of heart, Inside Out stands up there with the likes of Toy Story, Ratatouille, WALL E and Up as one of the finest movies to have ever come out of the studio.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Emotionally-creative,"This was a joy to watch. The emotion is definitely there, mostly because it comes in a way that all of us can really relate to, in terms of specific scenarios that we are seeing play out on the screen and remembering when they happened in our own lives. This was a good film... but just one day later, and I'm liking it less and less. I think the overall theme and the beginning and ending is fantastic. But I think its second act proves to be really problematic. The film starts to have things happen for the sake of entertainment and humor, without really having a purpose to the overall storyline. This happens with all children's films, but for some reason it was more noticeable here. Some of the humor was kind of childish in a way that's more immature than anything. I liked it a lot, but I wish it had less pandering to its younger audience",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Terrific, Outstanding, Memorable and Unforgettable, and Dazzling Film that executes the concept of emotions brilliantly and heartwarmingly!!","From start to finish, Pixar's ""Inside Out"" (released in the month of May in Cannes and the month of June in the United States of America) is a MASTERPIECE!! The movie isn't just a visually stunning animated film; it's also a profound exploration of human emotions. The story dives into the mind of an 11-year-old girl named ""Riley Andersen"", who has been uprooted from her life in Minnesota to the bustling city of San Francisco in California. Inside Riley's head, five personified emotions - Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear - work tirelessly in her Headquarters every single day, guiding her thoughts, actions, and most importantly, her LIFE.The film's brilliance lies in its unique portrayal of these 5 emotions (amazingly, in the brand-new sequel entitled ""Inside Out 2 (2024)"", they will be introducing 4 new emotions to Riley's Emotional Headquarters - Anxiety, Embarrasment, Ennui, and Envy, coexisting with the previous 5 emotions seen in the previous movie). Joy, the leader, strives to keep Riley happy, while Sadness, often sidelined, plays a surprisingly crucial role in regulating her emotions. The film masterfully depicts the complexity of emotions in everyone's mind, how they can work together or clash, and how even sadness can have a valuable purpose in everyone's life. Moreover, ""Inside Out"" doesn't shy away from difficult emotions; it acknowledges the importance of sadness in processing loss and growth.Beyond the emotional core, the film boasts exceptional animation from ""Pixar Animation Studios"". The world inside Riley's head is a vibrant and imaginative landscape, with the Emotional Headquarters resembling a central command centre and the world of memories depicted in colourful and swirling spheres, whether they're short-term or long-term memories. Furthermore, the film seamlessly blends humour and heartwarming moments, making it a thoroughly enjoyable experience for all ages, although the part where Riley moves away from her family (with Anger, Disgust, and Fear only controlling her while Joy and Sadness are trying to find their way back to the Headquarters) to board the bus back to Minnesota due to Anger getting an idea (and sharing it with Disgust and Fear as well) to send her back to Minnesota to relive her core memories without her family is depressing and unsettling for me.""Inside Out (2015)"" is more than just a children's movie by Pixar (partnered by Disney). It is a film that resonates with viewers of all ages (including teenagers, adults, and even elderly people), offering a deeper understanding of the emotional rollercoaster we all experience in our lives. In addition, it is a reminder to embrace all of our emotions (our core emotions also shape out who we are). So, grab your tissues (or napkins), popcorn (any type), and anyone you love - ""Inside Out (2015)"" is an unforgettable cinematic experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Things take an especially tumultuous turn when the girl's parents uproot her from the Midwest to the California coast, for the first time causing her to encounter loneliness, isolation, and other difficulties. Trying the best way they can, the emotions bond together to guide her, but not without complications and very surprising results. Pixar, having rightfully earned its reputation for creativity and storytelling savvy, is able to redeem some of its previously underwhelming efforts with this sweet, sincere, unpredictable and extremely well-crafted tale that is sure to touch both children and adults alike.

Could've been better.,"Plot - This movie is very predictable. This concept has been done before, and the overall story is very formulaic. Yes, its great for a kids' movie, but as a movie it isn't as great as it could've been. There are a lot of very dumb and contradictory plot devices that could've been handled better *cough* train of thought *cough*.Animation - The animation is fantastic. I love all the detail and the way these different things are brought to life onscreen. There are a few things that probably could've been changed (for some reason the memories in the memory balls aren't from Riley's POV) but nothing that really ruins the movie.Characters - I know that its the point that all the characters are as simplistic as possible, but it does make the movie a bit boring at times.South Park - I don't know why, but this movie rips off Imaginaionland from South Park. They even call it that. Of course, the South Park version is much more entertaining and creative, but its clear that its a similar idea. Of all the things that this childrens' movie could rip off, that was unexpected.Overall this is a kinda average kids movie with amazing animation. There are a lot of creative plot devices that aren't handled anywhere near as well as they could've been. This movie gets points for effort and an air of creativity. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. Its a bit funny and a bit sad (I guess). If you are young, have kids, or are easily entertained then I'd recommend this.

"Pixar's animation, Inside Out, is a unique and imaginative experience that stands out from mainstream animation.","Pixar's animation, Inside Out, is a unique and imaginative experience that stands out from mainstream animation. Despite the studio's recent lack of inspiration since 2009's Up, Inside Out is a top Pixar production due to its combination of audacity, intelligence, wit, and emotional reward. Directed and co-written by Pete Docter and Ronnie del Carmen, the narrative revolves around Riley's psyche, with the film's characters being her feelings. The film begins with Riley's feelings, Joy, asking what is going on inside their heads. The film explores the concept of psychic events and how they can generate a story that can be sustained for 102 minutes. Inside Out meets these challenges with an inventiveness that is appropriately mind-boggling, making it a standout in the Pixar productions. Inside Out is a film that begins in a dark cavern, the Plato's cave of the unformed self. As baby Riley is born, Joy appears as a shimmering, big-eyed Tinkerbell-like pixie and observes Riley's view of the world on a cloud-like surveillance screen. Joy is joined by other emotions - Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger - which monitor Riley's life and produce her responses by operating a console of levers and buttons. The film explores the premise of little people busy working in your head, but it is more sophisticated and distinctively female-skewed. The real heroine is Joy, a pathologically upbeat micro-manager convinced that only positive feelings count. Amy Poehler instils Joy with something of the obsessive girl guide eagerness of her Leslie Knope in the TV sitcom Parks and Recreation. The narrative is set in the far reaches of Riley's psychic landscape, where her trauma triggers the seismic collapse of the ""personality islands"" that define who she is, devoted to themes such as family, friendship, and hockey. A control-room malfunction leaves Joy and Sadness wandering in a vast allegorical geography, including landmarks like imagination (a theme park) and the place where dreams are made: a movie studio. In the wildest moment, the wanderers enter a zone of abstract thought, where they are zapped into a series of increasingly simplified geometric shapes, as they and the film itself dizzyingly self-deconstruct. Inside Out hits an elusive sweet spot in terms of appealing to children and adults alike. It makes extraordinary use of knowing cuteness, such as Bing Bong, Riley's long-lost imaginary friend from early childhood. The story depicts the fading of childhood's mental furniture and explores the mechanics of forgetting, achieving a universal significance. The visual style is dazzling, flouting CGI's tendency to photorealism in favor of overt cartoonishness in a 1950s retro vein, and the running gags are delicious. Inside Out expertly tugs the heartstrings and shows how the film's theme is done.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
watch this movie without asking questions,"""Inside Out"" is not a simple animated film...it is THE animated film. For me this is the best animated film of all time, with a great detachment from all the other cartoons. The thing that makes this film special is the fact that I really got attached to the characters, making them unforgettable in my mind and indelible in my heart. This film hugged me, took me with it and never let me go. This movie brings you back to being a child, which I don't know how many animated films they can make. Pixar with this film proves once again a span over the other film houses, always managing to bring on the big screen indelible films for both children and adults. The music of the film is something indescribable, the main theme is so special that...bah, I don't know what to say, just listen to it. I do not feel obliged to express any opinion on the technical section on various characters because, you already know the answer, I would say that everything is perfect. I hope that the sequel confirms the unsurpassed level expressed in this film.(P. S: The movie came out when I was 5 years old and then I cried for this movie...now after I saw it again when I was 14, guess what? I obviously cried again.)

Inside Out (2015) is a fun, funny, and emotionally investing animated film with great voice acting, well-done 3D animation, likable emotion characters, creative visuals inside the person's mind, and a relatable human character that the emotions control; it is creative and clever with its idea on how emotions effect people or how the mind works while sleeping, dreaming, or other things we tend to do on multiple occasions.The five emotions Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are all likable and funny characters, who are voiced outstandingly by Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Bill Hader, and Mindy Kaling, with each emotion acting differently when controlling the main girl Riley and interacting with each other in entertaining ways; with Joy making sure Riley is always happy by keeping Sadness away from the control console, or just trying to keep everyone calm while they are in control. The main girl Riley the emotions control is a likable and relatable character for anyone that age dealing with issues, like moving to a new place or trying to fit in at a new school, but also you find out a lot about her and her parents making you care about them and what is going to happen next while the emotions are controlling her; I am glad that they made the main girl likable, or else this film would not have worked as well as it did. Lastly, while they are going around Riley's mind you not only learn new things about her, but I like how also you see how she sees things by using her imagination or just looking at things in a weird way.I liked that there was no villain in this film and that it was just showing how certain emotions affect us in many ways, and that we tend to use certain emotions like sadness to help get across certain issues you are having or to just communicate to other people or family members; throughout the film you can relate with the character Riley when she goes through many changes of emotions for age, and by seeing how her mind works, you can see what she is like as a normal girl. The 3D animation is great with having lots of nice visuals and nice-looking emotion character designs, along with the design and look of the inside of Riley's mind being creative and clever on how it portrays certain things we tend to do, like how they show memories/core memories be kept for us to look back on; but also, the film has quite a bit of effective emotional moments that will tug on your heartstrings and make you cry while watching, which is because of how strong the family dynamic is and how relatable the characters are.Inside Out (2015) is a fun, funny, and emotionally investing animated film with great voice acting, well-done 3D animation, likable emotion characters, creative visuals inside the person's mind, and a relatable human character that the emotions control; it is creative and clever with its idea, and very effective with its emotional moments, they balanced the emotional and funny moments very well making it less sloppy in how the film is put together. Lastly, there is not much else to say about this film that has not been said already about it, except that this an emotionally investing and fun animated film from Disney Pixar that is worth watching; both adults and kids will love this movie, and I highly recommend giving this a watch if you have not already.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
gave an important message,"This movie fulfilled its objective perfectly, watching it I felt all the emotions it talks about that are predominant during childhood, it reflects how hard that stage can be for many people and daily problems are shown in a more lively and sometimes childish way, the youngest children will not understand the movie but it will undoubtedly be a classic from their childhood that they will understand as they grow up.The movie may seem very dark or depressing but in my opinion I think that is what gives it that special touch that differentiates it from other movies of this type.I hope that more films like these continue to be created that show that growing up is not all sunshine.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of Pixar's best.,Your kids will love it. You will need tissues as well. But the lack of music and humor makes you feel somewhat boring at first forty minutes or so. Otherwise it's a great movie to watch with your family.,7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Amazed!!,"As a 3D artist, I was blown away by the incredible visuals and attention to detail in Inside Out. The way they brought the different emotions and thoughts to life in the film was just amazing. It felt like the characters' inner world was right there in front of me, thanks to the seamless integration of 3D animation.The way the animators captured the complexities of human emotions and translated them into visually striking and relatable characters was truly impressive. Inside Out didn't just show off technical skills, it also showed the power of storytelling through animation. It's inspiring to see how animation can deeply resonate with audiences, and I feel lucky to be part of an industry that can evoke such deep emotions.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Flight of the homunculi,"Philosopher Blaise Pascal raised the idea that inside every human mind was a humunculus, a mini-being controlling us; the question of what lay within the mind of the humunculus went unanswered. The idea has turned up intermittantly in popular culture ever since (including, cinematically, in the hands of Woody Allen, who played a sperm in one of his early films). In 'Inside Out', a girl is controlled by an entire team of mini-mes; but for me, this isn't one of the great Pixar movies. The plot is basically 'Toy Story' redux, and, while there are some good gags, the film lacks the internal coherence of the best Pixar work, and mostly paints with a broad brush. You won't find the subtle beauty of 'WALL-E' or 'Up' here; although I did like the cat, walking on the keyboard.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Just When you Think Pixar is Out...They're back In,"For most people, they may not remember the discourse around Pixar back in 2015. Pixar's golden reputation had taken some major blows. Underwhelming movies like ""Cars 2"" and ""Monsters University"" made people second guess whether they still had the stuff. After the critical and box office flop that was ""the Good Dinosaur"" a lot of click bait articles had declared it the ""end of Pixar"". Looking back, it all seems silly. It feels like the typical cycle of things. But then came ""Inside Out"", a movie so good, it got a 98% on RT and was thought to have been nominated for Best Picture. So, looking back, how does the film hold up? It is very good, its clever and packs an emotional punch.The film sets up a clever world, the characters all have the perfect match of voice acting and animation. They have an important lesson to teach their audience and they present it in a visual way that communicates their message in a from all can understand.There are parts of the worldbuilding that don't quite make sense. But that is overthinking the film and under feeling it. After all, the film was made by a Docter.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Worst Kids Movie Ever!,"I've watched my share of children's movies and usually enjoy them. My children (10g,10g, 9b, & 6b) and I watched this movie and it was the most depressing children's movie ever. It seemed to go on and on. I asked each child what they thought of the movie and they all said it was either boring or depressing and not entertaining. It depended on their age and whether they understood the content. The movie was just dark! I truly looked forward to watching this with my children after seeing the trailers, but this movie was a real disappointment. I can't believe the abundance of positive reviews, unless they were from college kids pursuing psych majors.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Review by ChatGPT,"""Inside Out,"" Pixar's 2015 animated masterpiece, is a heartfelt and imaginative exploration of the human mind and emotions. Directed by Pete Docter, this film delves into the intricate world inside the head of an 11-year-old girl named Riley, whose emotions-Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust-are personified and play central roles in her experiences and reactions.The brilliance of ""Inside Out"" lies in its unique concept and execution. The film's portrayal of emotions as characters navigating Riley's mind is both clever and poignant, providing a compelling narrative that resonates with audiences of all ages. Joy, voiced by Amy Poehler, is the driving force behind Riley's happiness, while Phyllis Smith's Sadness offers a counterbalance that proves essential to Riley's emotional growth.One of the film's standout achievements is its handling of complex emotional themes with grace and sensitivity. It vividly illustrates that all emotions have their place and purpose, particularly highlighting the importance of Sadness in fostering empathy, healing, and connection. This nuanced perspective on emotional well-being is a refreshing departure from more simplistic portrayals of happiness as the ultimate goal.Visually, ""Inside Out"" is a feast for the eyes, with vibrant, imaginative landscapes representing different parts of Riley's mind. The film's animation is top-notch, showcasing Pixar's trademark attention to detail and creativity. The character design and settings within Riley's mind, such as the colorful headquarters and the whimsical long-term memory storage, are both visually stunning and conceptually rich.The narrative is equally compelling, balancing humor and heart with remarkable deftness. The interactions between the emotions are both entertaining and insightful, providing moments of laughter as well as introspection. The film's climax, where Joy and Sadness come to understand their interconnected roles in Riley's life, is both emotionally satisfying and profoundly moving.""Inside Out"" also excels in its depiction of family dynamics and the challenges of growing up. Riley's journey reflects the universal experience of adapting to change, dealing with loss, and finding resilience. The film's portrayal of her relationship with her parents is touching and authentic, emphasizing the importance of support and understanding in navigating life's ups and downs.In conclusion, ""Inside Out"" is a triumph of storytelling and animation, offering a thoughtful and deeply emotional look at the complexities of the human mind. Its innovative concept, combined with rich visuals and a compelling narrative, makes it a standout film that resonates long after the credits roll.

An Epic Family Film,"I am going to see Inside Out 2 tomorrow, so I decided to go back and rewatch the first film and here is my review for Inside Out. The premise of the film focuses on a young girl and the different emotions in her head, as she makes a move, the emotions must react and try to help her be happy.Main Character
Amy Poehler plays Joy and she is so full of energy in this film, at first I thought she might have been a bit annoying but the film really pulls it around and Joy is a great character. She really goes through a character arc and by the end of the film you really feel like it was earned and Poehler adds a lot here.Supporting Characters
The main characters here are the emotions and they are played by some big names, the main one being Phyllis Smith who plays Sadness. It was similar to Joy, that she is really annoying to begin with but once again the film brings it around with a good character arc throughout and by the end she was fun to watch.The other emotions include fear who is played by the brilliant Bill Hader and I really loved him in this film. He just has true comedic timing and he uses that to his best ability here to really shine. We also have Disgust played by Mindy Kaling and she was a lot of fun, I think she is probably the emotion that does the least here by Kaling is a talented actress and adds something to the character. But the standout for me was Anger played by Lewis Black. He is every grumpy old man and his rants are hilarious and some of my favourite bits of the film.Richard Kind plays Riley's imaginary friend Bing Bong and he is great, he is there as kind of a guide for Joy & Sadness and he felt like a great addition. He also has a pretty subtle story arc and it is handled expertly well and makes you really care about him.Story
The story is really great, it is a really creative idea and I love how they turn a young girls mind into this cartoony world but it all makes sense and though it is ridiculous it just feels right. I think the film is really relatable because every human feels these emotions and by giving the emotions arcs further adds to us caring about what is going on.Script
The film is really well written, it has some incredibly smart dialogue and was a pretty funny film that had me laughing quite a bit. There is also some real emotion here which is key considering the concept of the film and they really deliver with it.Style
The film is really great visually. Pixar has never struggled when it comes to the look of there films and this film is very exuberant and colourful showcasing the mind of a human being. Also the film is only 90 minutes long and is paced brilliantly, it never loses its pace and is fun throughout.Overall
Overall, Inside Out is an Epic Family Film that totally ticks all the boxes for the whole family and it really delivers. This is a must watch for everyone and I think anybody will enjoy it.Rating - 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Clever, Original and Poignant","There aren't that many completely original ideas coming out of Hollywood very often anymore, but Inside Out is one of the best examples of a film made in the last ten years that truly invented something new. The concept was fresh and the execution was flawless. Giving the internal emotions each a figure inside the mind of a twelve-year-old girl, Riley, navigating growing up through big changes in her family is very clever in its image and storytelling; I haven't seen anything like that before or since.While the overall plot was constantly working toward a relatively simple goal- returning Joy and Sadness back to Headquarters- there are lots of opportunities for comedic relief and creative tie-ins for various phenomena inside our brains. Sadness felt particularly perfectly cast to me and her lines made me laugh out loud more regularly than any other character.I really loved the recognition and voiced concept that some things and memories that we, as humans, remember as being positive are only positive because sadness came first. For a movie that's aimed toward kids, I think that is a really beautiful lesson to have illustrated so articulately because it could also offer language to explain complicated emotions they may be feeling in ways they might not have been prepared for before.Bing Bong, no matter how many times I watch this movie, will always tug on my heart strings. There's so much warmth and playfulness in his character and, despite his ditsy nature getting himself and the emotions into trouble, he brings levity to the screen as Riley's imaginary friend that she is outgrowing.The look of the world inside Riley's mind- including core memories, the personality islands, Headquarters, long term memory, the trains of thought, the dream production studio, imagination land- all of them weave together to create a rich world but remain careful not to overcomplicate the details.Ending the film with such clear opportunities for sequels was a very smart move because the end of the first film does feel satisfying and complete, but there's definitely more to explore as she grows up. I appreciate how the audience spends most of the film inside Riley's brain, but the few glimpses we get into her parent's thoughts throughout add extra humor and subtle general truths to typical family dynamics.Rewatching this film made me really excited to see the sequel and I can't wait to see how they expanded the universe as the characters grow up and how the new emotions impact the already existing ones.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
the worst movie ever,"""All we need is joy"" what is that kind of mind? We need all the feelings, that makes us be human. The important thing is you have to learn to control your feeling not run away from it. What kind of a life that just full of joy, what a boring life to me then. Now after this movie, people will have more reason and person to blame for their failure.Good Job, pixxar.I'm gonna rate this movie is the worst movie that Pixxar ever made.She just cant play the game because three dumb guys in her head can put the ball to the right place? What the hell is that kind of situation, now kid can have more reason to blame when then fail or doing something wrong, right?""Because 3 dumb guys in my head make me like that""Who? your 3 What in your head ?Wake up, girl.

"Funny, touching, brilliantly creative animation about emotions for children and parents alike","This is one of the best films Pixar has created, in my opinion, and one of the most inventive, as well. It has something to say about the value of every emotion to a person, a message which needs to be conveyed both to kids and adults. It has great humour (and an adult joke, as well, which is carefully hidden, though) and a big heart, it's powerfully moving, realistic, it boasts gorgeous animation, a talented voice cast and above all, it is as charming and delightful as one would expect from a movie of the studio, making it yet another massive success from Pixar, with well-deserved universal acclaim. The premise about the girl who is moving house without expecting it is everyday and relatable, adding to the animated film's resonance. The way each emotion acts seems believable to viewers and the soundtrack is a perfect match for every scene (Michael Giacchino does an excellent job as with ""Up""), and the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature was for sure rightly earned. To sum up, this is an ultimately uplifting animation adults can identify with (as with other Pixar works), and is bound to entertain every member of the family, while successfully getting its point across. Its remarkability makes it a new modern classic from Pixar studio.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar and age stages,"An enjoyable, instructive, realistic animation that has been worked with professionals throughout the five-year production process.Age stages is a favorite subject of Pixar, middle age in The Incredibles and old age in Up; Inside Out is also a story of growing up, examining childhood and adolescence.""Have you ever looked at someone and wondered what they were thinking?"" The story begins with a question.Dream studio, prison of the unconscious, islets of character, spikes, imaginary friend; The connections between them are very successful.Emotion centers and their effects on decision making were also realistic but incomplete; but maybe it can be detailed in a further / different version, because other factors affecting the character are not taken into account. But that's not the focus of the movie anyway, so it doesn't affect its success much.Animation, whose target audience is adults rather than children, can be said to appeal to all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Makes up for a lack of plot with an abundance of creativity,"I'll admit to not being the biggest Pixar fan, but that's mostly because American computer animation usually isn't as compelling as other stuff I like. I also don't prefer overly ""kiddie"" movies anymore, thanks to no longer being a kid. That being said, INSIDE OUT is one of Pixar's better films, even if I didn't love it as much as something like UP. To its credit, INSIDE OUT is actually more geared towards the older crowd, since a lot of the psychology of emotions will probably go over younger children's heads. In this sense, Pixar finds themselves in a bit of a bind. While expertly realized visually, literalizing the emotions just makes their manipulation that much more evident and, in my opinion, less effective. That's not to say it's all bad, because there were a number of moments that I thought were cute and funny. Its greatest fault is slow-burning an emotional payoff on top of such a thin story. In the end, though, I was won over thanks to the excellent visuals, inventive conceptualization, and outstanding voice work. Lewis Black as Anger has to be one of the best, and most spot-on, castings ever. It also wouldn't be a Pixar movie without a tearjerking moment or two. When it's all said and done, INSIDE OUT isn't the best Pixar movie ever, but it's an improvement over their last few.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Revived Pixar's reputation,"After Toy Story 3, The seemingly perfect Pixar spiraled down for a few years when they released Cars 2, and Brave which audiences and critics necessarily didn't like, MU is better than the previous 2 but it was still underwhelming for Pixar standards. Inside Out was a film Pixar NEEDED at the time and luckily it cameWhile I think Inside Out still doesn't quite rival Pixar's golden era, it was still an amazing experience! The humor hits you once in a while and you really care about Riley's well-beings. You can really feel when Riley's life starts to go down and it was pretty enjoyable as well even if you don't count its powerhouse of its emotion, hey speaking of which.The emotions are really powerful mixed up with a rather unique message. I cried twice in the film and that is not an exaggeration because it is truly on the next level. Bing Bong's death is really heartbreaking, I used to cry at it when I was a little kid and I still cry to it to this day plus the scene when Riley reunites with her family is really heartwarming. I absolutely love this filmBut no matter how great it can be, there will always be problems.

"Slightly grim, slightly funny","A young girl's emotions set out on a rescue mission when she becomes increasingly sad following her family's move to the big city to start a new life.Disney brings the concept of the Numskulls to a new level. The animation explores a sometimes nightmarish world, where a simplified set of emotions is personified in a team of bumbling characters that negotiates a landscape of threatening imagination and cold, industrialised memory processes.The pace is pretty good, with an escalating roller-coaster ride of challenges and defeats as the emotions struggle to restore the girl to her vibrant happy self, only to find another self is emerging. This kept veering into a darker narrative, and I guess the writers constantly had to push back into more wholesome territory with the girl's personal story overwhelmed by the more hectic experiences of team emotion.Editing and performances are good, and the music hardly noticeable. Some decent laughs, but nothing great. Best scene is in the memory dump.Overall, good and imaginative with a satisfying ending, but the plot maybe lacks a bit of drive as the link between the trauma of the move and the growing sadness lacks some truth and difficulty. I suppose this comes through in the upbeat preachiness and downbeat interference, respectively, of the characters Joy and Sadness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Fun and deep at the same time,"""Inside Out"" caters to all audiences - bright colors for the young kids, sympathy for those going through turbulent change, and some deep and well-researched philosophical musings for both experts and students of the mind, not to mention those simply looking to watch something psychedelic to supplement their high. With such an impressive production design, all of the voice actors do this movie justice, led by Amy Poehler as Joy. The standout for me is Sadness played by Phyllis Smith from ""The Office."" Each scene with her is indeed a downer yet so captivating; you want to keep watching to peel through the layers. Overall, this is a unique ""cartoon"" movie that not only entertains but makes you think about what it means to be human.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I LOVED it!,"Inside Out (2015) is a beautifully animated film that vividly brings to life the complexities of a person's emotions, memory, personality, dreams, and interpretation. The characters representing Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness are excellently designed, perfectly capturing the essence of each emotion.The soundtrack is so diverse that they also represent ""emotions"" from the film: from piano to forte, and from fun, upbeat, peaceful, nurturing to sad tracks. The sound design is unique and clear, though I wish there were more low-end sounds.The editing is top-notch, with perfect pacing and timing. To me, it might be weird to say but the film felt like a Chris Nolan-directed animated feature for children, which is a high compliment.The storytelling is highly engaging that kept me hooked from start to finish. The film takes a complicated psychological topic and makes it accessible and visually appealing for children. The execution of the story idea and its visual depiction is nearly flawless. The interactions among the emotions are both effective and relatable.While the plot is somewhat predictable, it is necessary to understand the dynamics of the film and the reactions of the characters. Humor is skillfully woven into the narrative, balancing the bittersweet and sad moments with hopefulness.The last 30 minutes of the film are particularly emotional, highlighting the sacrifices required, adding complexity to the narrative. While the focus is mainly on Riley, the main protagonist, the film does provide glimpses into her parents' emotions which, to me, partly compensates for the story. However, I wish there was more context about them, although it makes sense since the story is from Riley's perspective.The moral of the story is profound: every emotion is important, and teamwork among them is essential, even when it's not always effective.Overall, Inside Out is a visually stunning and emotionally profound film that beautifully illustrates the importance of every emotion. With engaging storytelling, nearly flawless execution, and a strong moral message, to me, it earns a solid 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best Pixar's standards,"Disney's best animation. Because it has a very well-prepared story and event fiction. Characters and character reactions are very good. But this movie is a little short. There's a lot of fun to be had with this, it's one of the funnier and more thought. I could also tell that this is one of Pixar's more mature films, about the struggles of growing up. But despite everything, I was very surprised that this movie did not fall below Pixar standards and that they were able to convey such a difficult subject with ease .I hope we see more movies like this.

Pixar's best film,"Inside Out is pure Pixar magic. It's the rare film to focus on childhood imagination that actually has the endless imagination to really sell that concept. It's the classic Pixar blend of great comedy, constant invention, and a simple yet profound message at its core, all contained in a stunningly realised world that results in their best film.All the core emotions are so perfectly cast. They bring everything to their performances and they really do sound like the embodiment of the emotions they're playing. Richard Kind's Bing Bong is somehow even more perfectly cast. His line delivery is faultless with naivety and kindness pouring out of every word which crescendos in an emotional moment that never loses its potency.Pete Docter's direction along with the screenplay by himself, Josh Cooley, and Meg LeFauve never runs out of ideas. Ideas, emotions, and personality traits are all realised in really smart ways that also lend themselves to a lot of clever jokes. They really trust you to understand some of the subtler points made without needing to say anything or draw attention to them.The animation is stunning as usual, something Pixar's teams are so consistently good that it's never not mind blowing. It's amazing how they're able to create embodiments of feelings whilst still giving them an ethereal nature plus there's a nice contrast between the vibrant world of Riley's mind and the bleak reality of the outside world.Michael Giacchino's score is beautiful. He's an immensely talented composer who's done his fair share of iconic scores for other Pixar films and yet he continues to be able to create something distinct for each new entry.

The film brilliantly personifies these emotions as characters-Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust-who guide Riley through the ups and downs of her experiences.The heart of ""Inside Out"" lies in its innovative premise and emotional depth. Through the central character of Joy, voiced by Amy Poehler, the film explores the fundamental importance of happiness and positivity in shaping Riley's memories and personality.

The mechanism of emotions,"I watched this movie when I was little, and now that I've grown up, I understand every emotion perfectly.While I've been watching it, I've realized that the way they represent the mechanism of emotions is very interesting. It really resembles our reality, how our emotions continuously change and we seek emotional stability. Pixar's movie nails it; it is charming and moving, truly profound. They describe the basic emotions: joy, sadness, fear, disgust, and anger. Each of them is represented by a character that lives inside the body of any living being, with associated islands like family.In conclusion, this movie is magical in its explanation of the mechanism of a person's emotions.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
There is no bad emotion in 'Inside Out',"For me, the film turns out to be more than what I expected: an emotional roller-coaster. It explores not only about the competition of five personified emotions inside an 11-year-old girl to control her actions, but also a dazzlingly picturesque imagery of a world inside a human's head. That includes some of astounding depictions of a mind map, such as Dream Productions, Emotions Head-quarters, Imagination Land, Long Term Memory Labyrinth, Personality Islands, and the creepy, dark chasm of Memory Dump.The scenes mostly take place in the mind of a girl named Riley, who suddenly finds a bumpy road after being uprooted from her Midwest life as her father starts a new job in San Francisco. Joy (voiced by Amy Poehler), who is the main emotion here, tries as best as she can to ensure Riley to be happy in the new city. However, the other four emotions, Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling) dominate Riley's mind as she experience some culture shocks.The condition is getting worse after Sadness touches some memory orbs containing the Minnesota's memories, making Riley desperately misses the old town and hate her current place. Joy tries to prevent Sadness from touching core memories but they accidentally plunged out of Head-quarters, leaving Fear, Anger and Disgust to take care the fragile girl. I'm sure you can predict what chaos that is going to happen next.What I love the most about Inside Out, like other Pixar's films, is the ability to touch adult audiences through childhood memories and imagination. In Toy Story, we are all connected to the toys, and reminisce that we used to have a special toy. Inside Out has that charm too. Besides taking us to travel the dazzlingly animated world of Riley's mind, it also shows us the cherished memories that adults might forget about, including the joy of our parents when we were born, the fear of Grandma's vacuum cleaner and the weird Birthday clown, and a cheerful imaginary friend, which in Riley's mind, is a pink elephant named Bing Bong. I love Bing Bong so much I cried when he said Riley had stopped playing with him as she grew older — and told Sadness about a lost wagon-rocket: 'It's all I had of Riley.' I think Inside Out is one of the finest Pixar's animated ever made. I'm surprised that the film gets too much hatred for 'putting an adult theme into a child's movie'. I think it's a perfect movie to watch with the whole family, so the parents can understand what's exactly going on in their children's minds. The kids can learn about prime emotions and how they're all connected. The point is, there is no such thing as a bad emotion, that the emotions all have in common is that they are all about taking care of you.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Enjoyed it,"Enjoyed it a lot.Great animation and creativity.When things go badly awry, Joy and Sadness are pitched out of the control room and dumped into the depths of Riley's long term memory an area bearing a shockingly multi-coloured resemblance to the Hall of PropheciesIn Riley's head brought vividly to life by Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear. Sitting - Star Trek Enterprise style - at a console somewhere behind Riley's forehead, they watch what's going on and control her emotions to suit.With no joy or sadness in her life, how can Riley cope? There follows a desperate mission to return Joy and Sadness to the HQ, aided and abetted by Riley's long-lost imaginary friend Bing Bong, before her life is permanently wrecked by bad decisions.Let's start with the positives on this film. Inside Out is enormously inventive. If the Indiana Jones series drove an interest in kids doing degrees in Archaeology, then the same could happen for Psychology as a result of this movie. At the very least, you can see how kids with issues of anger management or depression could really get genuine value out of this simple movie by visualising and therefore understanding their problems better.The sociological impacts of the movie might actually be quite profound.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Really good,"The best adjective with which to describe this movie is emotional. Specifically, melancholy. It's a sad movie. (That makes sense given that it's a movie about the necessity of sadness as an emotion.) If sad movies aren't your cup of tea then this movie might not be for you though I really liked it.Beyond that, some of the jokes are funny though they're really in the background so I can't recommend this movie for its comedy (at least not primarily for it. It has a sense of humour but it's primarily a sad film.)I do wonder what the ramifications actually are of the fact that Joy can feel fear, sadness and anger and that indeed each of the emotions feels actual emotions (do they have consoles in their head the way Riley does?) but that's honestly a nitpick.All in all, I think this movie is really good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The Feels Are Real,"My first time rewatching this in several years and while I didn't gush over this movie like some, I still found it to be a cozy and cute movie about 5 emotions duking it out while trying to balance one another inside of an 11 year old girl's mind. The acting was great and it even managed to tug at the heart strings a bit in typical Pixar fashion. What I found interesting though was how the ending managed to set up a sequel that didn't end up happening for about 9 years later, which when you think about it should have been a lot sooner since the sequel hinted it being and revolving around puberty and it's many new emotions. Overall I think I would still put Inside Out where I would put other mid-tier Pixar films like Ratatouille and Cars, being a solid flick with some enjoyable moments but nothing truly spectacular other than a bunch of charming ideas and performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"laugh, cry, and think all at once","Inside Out is one of those rare animated movies that makes you laugh, cry, and think all at once. The story dives into the mind of an 11-year-old girl, Riley, where her emotions-Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust-are trying to help her navigate a big life change.The film's message is simple but profound: every emotion, even sadness, has a purpose. The creative way it visualizes Riley's inner world, from Personality Islands to the Train of Thought, is pure Pixar magic. Plus, the soundtrack is just beautiful and hits all the right emotional notes.Whether you're a kid or an adult, Inside Out is a movie that sticks with you.

Bing Bong carries,"When I'm watching an animated film I always like to think of it from the perspective of the adults who are having to give up their golf day to take the kids to see a movie. Are they having a good time? Because kids will enjoy any old thing. 'Inside Out' is going to be a very middling film for the adults.The concept is great, can't fault that. A really top notch idea whoever came up with this. Where it falls down is the humour. It just isn't funny enough. With the exception of one character however.The true star of the show though is 'Bing Bong'. A truly incredible character that deserves every bit of recognition he gets. His scenes are both the comedic highlights of the film and can hit you with a sledgehammer when they've got you lined up just right.As good as the concept is, it does start to drag a bit after the first hour and more limps to the finish line than anything else.

The True Feelings of Pixar,"This movie is the perfect way to describe Pixar, as a studio that not only entertains, but also to make us feel. And this one is no exception. Inside Out is easily one of the best movies Pixar has created. It was crafted beautifully for its concept that's about emotions and what may be going on in your head. And it really exceeds its concept wonderfully for having a heartfelt story, very creative animation, its world building of how the mind works, very cute comedy, incredibly crafted characters that demonstrate the emotions they are, and especially for having an emotional connection to Riley's struggle. This is definitely a movie that everybody should watch, especially those that are like me and truly admire Pixar's works. I know some may say that the studio is not as great as it used to be, but no matter what, I've always been all for any Pixar film for each film that gets released and can still make great films to this day. And that's exactly how I feel with this movie for being the highlight of what makes Pixar so great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar may be coming back.,"Lately, Pixar hasn't created anything considered perfect since Toy story 3. Cars 2 and Monsters university weren't great and didn't live up to others. But now we have this film, which is one of two Pixar films this year.When I saw this film, there was a theatrical short called ""Lava"". The short was actually awful, un-entertaining, and was like a romance music video. I give that one a 2/10.OK, on to Inside out. The film was fun, funny, and even a little complicated like the Toy story films. Before this film was released, I really doubted this film, thinking the concept would be unappealing and the writing might not be good. But this bashed my low expectations. I liked the adventure in this film because the backgrounds were excellent and made me feel like I was either in San Francisco or inside Riley's brain. The animation also made the emotions look cute, but the thing about this film is, like other Pixar films, it starred human characters in it, but the animation just creates good looking humans because its not always a good idea t make your animated film look as real as possible like ""The Polar express"". As for the characters, the emotions are sometimes funny and a little lovable. One problem is that I feel like the emotions have emotions of their own. Like there are scenes where Sadness and Anger smile like they're happy. That makes no sense since they're supposed to feel their own emotion since Joy is called Joy for example.This film doesn't have a good theatrical short, but it is still great movie that makes up for Pixar's previous disappointments (Cars 2, anyone?), and manages to blow away doubts. I hope Pixar continues this comeback with the Good dinosaur this Fall. Kinda hard to believe that Pixar would release 2 films in one year when during previous years it would be one at a time.Update July 26: When I created this review 3 weeks ago, I noticed a lot of negative reviews even though it has a 8.7 average rating. Its sad to see it have all this undeserved hate. At least tons of others have the critics point of view for this film. Plus, all this hate is coming from people who thought it was ""sad"". Sure they do have an opinion but this movie is still clever even when some parts like Bing bongs entire storyline is sad. If you watch the first 10 minutes of Up, you may understand that sad is sometimes sad in a good way. I can't wait for its home release then I can watch it over and over again.Update: This stupid troll is still going. Its down to a a8.4! WHY?Anyway, I'd like to thank the people who gave this at least a 7/10. Its beautiful and heartwarming and deserves to be in any animation hall of fame. Its just amazingSO DON'T LISTEN TO HATERS, EVERYONE! JUST BECAUSE ITS MORE SUITABLE FOR OLDER CHILDREN DOSEN'T MEAN ITS A BAD FILM!Oh, and one more FYI, its better for kids then that horrible Cat in the hat movie (This film has no adult jokes).Story: 9/10 Animation: 9/10 Characters: 10/109/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
This film was funny and had a refreshing lesson to tell.,"Inside Out is the story of a little girl named Riley and the little voices inside her head that control her emotions. After Riley's family moves to a new home, the emotions in her head (Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear and Sadness) begin to experience some technical difficulties and question the purpose of Sadness. While trying to keep Riley in check, Joy and Sadness get separated from the group and have to try and get back to headquarters before Riley has an emotional breakdown. While I have found the last few of Pixar's films have strayed from their audience (either focusing too much on the children or the adults), this one is a return to form. While there are more then enough jokes meant for children and there are just as many meant for adults. I laughed quite often. The art style is perfect for the concept and the casting was perfect. There is a lot to like, but my favorite aspect of this film is the moral lesson that this film teaches. Not only is the lesson incredibly useful to not only children and adults, but it is truly helpful and a lesson that not a lot of people focus on. There are not many flaws with the film. Most of my complaints are nitpicking at best. The biggest one I have is with the structure of the plot and not the plot itself. It suffers from what I call Armageddon Syndrome (named after the first film that I noticed having this particular issue). A good plot is supposed to slowly increase tension and progress through a series of important moments until it reaches a climax where it them calms down and resolves. Armageddon Syndrome is where there seems to be little to no progress until the final climax. The plot in Inside Out just looped itself for a majority of the film until it felt like finishing. This made the movie get a little boring at times. Joy and Sadness would try some method to get back by going to locations that signify different parts of the human psyche, would fail, and try again until no more jokes and puns could be made. While this is a major, glaring issue with the film, it doesn't detract all that much since the writing is so good. The best way to think of this film is like a road trip across the country. The destinations are fun and memorable, but the drive between them is kind of boring and repetitive. Despite this I highly recommend watching Inside Out.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Nice Movie...,"Inside Out is the latest Disney Pixar movie from Oscar winning director Pete Doctor, best known for his work with other classics like Up, Monsters Inc., and the Toy Story movies. The film centers on the emotions that help to guide the life of a 12 year old girl named Riley. Joy, voiced by Amy Poehler, is the predominant emotion and serves as the leader inside Riley's head. As a result, Riley is a very happy and relatively care-free girl who greatly enjoys her life in Minnesota. However, things take a turn when her family moves to San Francisco for her father's work.In Minnesota, Sadness, voiced by Phyllis Smith from The Office, was a relatively marginalized part of Riley's subconscious. However, as the family moves, Sadness begins to play a growing role without either her or any of the others really understanding why. Her actions lead Joy to try even harder to maintain control and keep Riley happy. However, those efforts result in calamity when she and Sadness are accidentally sent to another part of Riley's mind. As a result, Fear, Disgust, and, primarily, Anger are left to try and guide her through the tumultuous experience of adjusting to a new school and a new life while Joy and Sadness try to make the difficult trip back.Over the course of their journey, Joy gains a greater appreciation for Sadness and the role she needs to play in Riley's life. Joy learns that for Riley to function, she can't always be happy and that there will be times where the other emotions need to take on a greater role. Ultimately, it's only when she steps aside and allows Riley to actually express her sadness without bottling it up that the young girl is able to cope with the move and embrace her new life.Inside Out offers an entertaining yet powerful reminder of the need for emotional honesty. There may be times where it is necessary to set aside grief or anger in order to properly address the situation at hand, but when bottling up those emotions becomes a pattern it can only end in disaster. Jesus is perhaps our greatest example for understanding the benefits and the correctness of emotionally honest expression.Joy is manifested throughout his life and ministry but is perhaps best seen in the delight he takes when interacting with children and his disciples. However, we also see the other emotions displayed at various points in his life. He lived a sinless life but shows righteous anger and disgust when throwing the money changers out of the temple (Matthew 21:12-13). And he shows fear and sadness in the Garden of Gethsemane when he prays repeatedly for a way to avoid the cross if God's will could still be accomplished by doing so (Matthew 26:36-46).Ultimately, Jesus understood that while control was necessary, so was appropriate emotional expression. His life demonstrates a level of balance that can only be achieved when we realize that each of our emotions has its proper, God-given place in our lives. Acting otherwise by attempting to marginalize some aspect of our nature, whether it be sadness, anger, or any of the others, can prevent us from living the kind of life to which God has called us. In that way, it is quite similar to sin even if we may not often see it as such.So which emotions do you struggle to express? Why is that? Knowing the answers to those questions and acting on that knowledge are the first steps towards greater balance and the ability to live the kind of full life for which God has created you.So the next time you are tempted to set aside your first emotional impulse, stop and ask why that is. It may be that such action is necessary for the moment but never make it a pattern. Such repression is not healthy and, more importantly, it's not God's will for your life. He created you for more than that so live accordingly and you will know the kind of joy and peace that can only come from a well-balanced life.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

An Emotional Stir,"""Inside Out"" is directed by Pete Docter, starring Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith marking Pixar's 15th feature. Right off the bat, this film is imaginative and creative. The concept is, of course, original and it isn't a surprise since Pixar has some great story boards. However, what makes this film special is that, even with it's creative concept and premise, if you simmer it down, it really is just a simple and heartfelt story. It's about an 11 year old girl who loses her core memories and Joy and Sadness in the process. Now they have to get back before she does anything stupid or lose herself, but as usual it becomes a fun adventure that still plays with our heart strings.The first half of this film was bent on introducing the concept and the imaginative world of what goes on in our brain. For some people, it felt tedious, and granted, it does feel a little bit like that in some few parts of the first half, but nonetheless it was understandable considering they had to introduce a whole new world which was inside our heads and they did a pretty great job at doing that when the film progressed. Amy Poehler and Phyllis Smith were both great in their respective roles as Joy and Sadness. Seeing how these two different emotions begin to mix up and play along together was a great idea, seeing how obvious having these two emotions together will result in great chemistry and entertainment. The way each and every emotion/character was handled differently and that worked for the film. Another great aspect of the film was that it was relatable. Riley's character was simple, yet she was relatable to children nowadays and reminded the more older audience how they were when they were younger.Moving on, the animation in this film is spectacular. Pixar's previous film ""Monster's University"" had such a rather realistic rendering of the characters and the surroundings, however Pixar takes it up a notch and the animation style improves furthermore in this film. The surroundings looked much more vibrant and colorful, each character design had a special and unforgettable feature to it. Pixar once again creates a beautiful and transcendent world to ponder on.As for the story, it's one of the simplest, yet creative stories Pixar has ever done. In it's close 1 hour and 30 minute run time, the film is a straightforward adventure. Joy and Sadness need to get back her Core Memories before Riley ends up destroying her life and her mind as a whole. That's where the story kicks in and some ups and downs are made. When you think about it (pun intended), it's really just a story of an 11 year old girl coping with her problems and because of that simplicity and with great execution from Pixar, we got one of the most heartwarming, touching, moving and poignant film they've ever made. If you simmer it down, this film isn't about some convoluted story about Monsters or Cars or Superheroes, it's a simple story about emotions and family, nothing more and nothing less. That's the beauty of this film.Even if it were just a simple film with a simple story, it did not fail in touching our hearts like any other Pixar film bringing us to near tears, if not, into full tears. It was already a given that this film would get our emotions running, because it's a film about emotions. But even if it were a film about emotions, I have to say, it surprised me to find out that a simple story like this could get you to clench your heart and nearly cry. Even if for some people that don't cry in this film, it's impossible not to relate and feel your heart be warmed when watching this film. At the end of the day, this was a great comeback for Pixar and it shows that even after 20 years, they still don't fail to create original and intriguing worlds and touch our hearts at the same time.+Creative concept and premise, +All around fun adventure, +Joy and Sadness, +Spectacular Animation, +Unique characters and surroundings, +A simple, yet touching story at it's core.Verdict: 9.3/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An Allegorical Masterpiece...,"I often dreamed about movies, but never BEFORE watching them. It happened with ""Inside Out"", I had heard so many great things about it and the ubiquitous multi-colored posters were so eye-catchy, that the film was ""inside"" my mind already, fittingly so, and now that I saw it, I can say that it will stay there... for a while.""Inside Out"" is indeed the kind of movie that makes you want to emulate Amélie by turning around in the theater and see the smiling faces of the people around. I don't know for you, but after a few minutes, my eyes were literally glued to the screen, and from the expression on my face, you could tell that Joy's smile and optimism were irresistibly contagious.The entrance of Joy (Amy Poehler) and the genesis of the other emotion-related creatures in the mind of little Riley, echoed both my memories as a child and my current life as a little girl's daddy. Now, I look at her cries, her tantrums and the way she makes funny faces when told to behave herself in a whole different light. In less than five minutes, the film had already hit a sensitive chord, not that I doubt an animated film could achieve such a sentimental 'stunt', ""Mary and Max."" and ""Up"" had also done a terrific job on that level.It's worth mentioning ""Up"" because the two films hold a few similarities, beside being from the same director Pete Docter. Indeed, after tackling the loneliness of old age and the mourning of lost dreams, it's time for a brighter mindset, no pun intended. Riley is a preteen girl, still young enough to make monkey faces with Daddy, think of boys as playmates and sleep with soft toys, but she's old enough to react with maturity and empathy as her parents expect from their happy girl (in parent's language ""understanding"") and all the emotions help Riley to face this critical time of her life, by pushing the right button (inside) at the right moment (out), literally.So, as the title suggests, the film is set in two worlds, the real world with Riley moving with her parents from Minnesota to San Francisco and the inside of her head, the ""headquarters"" where emotions lead the show. The Chief Emotion is Joy, a blue-haired Tinkerbell-like creature with hair shaped like a star and radiating such an illuminated yellow she doesn't have a shadow. Joy looks at the bright side of life, and makes it a point of honor not to let Riley surrender to sadness the poor, short, rotund, bespectacled Sadness (Phyllis Smith) who can't push any button, and that doesn't do any good to her already low self-esteem.With a bossy emotion like Joy, Riley is a naturally happy girl, but as you would read in every 'Stay Positive' or 'Emotional Intelligence' book, each feeling has a reason to exist. Anger allows us to defend our integrity and fear is about self-preservation, sadness is a reaction to things we can't control and disgust, well disgust actually feels like a 'filler' because it doesn't have more reason to be there than, say, surprise or distrust. Never mind, the real outsider is Sadness. In other headquarters, thing go differently: the mother's chief emotion is Sadness and a mustached 'Anger' controls the father (by the way, I enjoyed these little glimpses on other headquarters, a nice touch for a film full of them).Now to the emotions, voiced by Lewis Black and based on his stand-up routines, Anger is a red fire brick dressed like a tired businessman, Fear is a purple raw nerve voiced by Bill Hader and Disgust is a broccoli-shaped fashion victim voiced by Mindy Kaling. Cinema is an Art of imagery and I don't think there's been a film as visually stunning without going for complex forms and settings; it's all in the colors, shapes and personalities. Emotions are people, memories are balls with the same color than their emotional value and Riley's mind is an enchanting Oz-like place, surrounded by Goofball, Family or Friendship Islands, where the core memories are 'stocked'.I was critical toward ""Inception"" because the film had a similar concept but didn't have much to offer except for predictable CGI special effects. In ""Inside Out"", emotions, dreams, imaginary friends, little things that define us, everything is materialized in a creatively allegorical way. This is escapism at its best and it didn't have to go as far as the Lost Falls. Recreating an entire world is the biggest challenge of animated cartoons, but ""Inside Out"" created an entire new world and made its functioning coherent, easy to follow and scientifically viable in a weird way.But I make it sound like a technical achievement, the film also fulfills its premise in the storytelling department. By accidentally preventing Sadness from saddening a happy memory during the first day of school, both Joy and Sadness are expelled from the headquarters and get lost somewhere in the brain. They must get back, otherwise, Riley will only be controlled by anger, disgust and fear. And the oddest thing is that Riley's behavior still looks familiar from an outsider's perspective. Seriously, how many times we've met young kids behaving exactly like Riley?The film unexpectedly provides some interesting insights about kids' behavior and the way they repress positive emotions, to the point that even the 'negative' ones can't control them and make them capable of anything. Some parts are so intense they catch you off-guard, but they help to show the importance of emotions depending on the context. And during this unforgettable journey, Joy will also understand the power of sadness as a vehicle for happier emotions... no high spots without low ones.I start with smiles and I conclude with tears, because after all, this is still a Disney film, and paraphrasing the Master: for every laugh, there should be a tear.

Childhood depression made quirky and interesting,"It's hard to simplify Inside Out into a few sentences. We follow a girl called Riley and the emotions in her head. Riley moves cross country from Minnesota to San Francisco. This has a mental impact on her and it unleashes havoc in her brain. The emotions have to get their act together before Riley falls into a permanent state of depression and causes irreparable damage to her brain.Inside Out is fantastic. There are so many fantastic touches added into this movie. I love that the emotions in the mother's head resemble the panel on the View. I love the dream sequence. I love the scene where the mind workers are deleting the memories that Riley doesn't need anymore. It is made with the same thought that was put into Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo.The message from the movie is entirely wholesome. I think it's a great message to give children that it is okay to feel more than one way about an event. We can't always be happy and always be angry. Inside Out shows us the issues with this. The only message that this movie proports that I am not so fond of is that the movie seems to say that when you are depressed, you are emotionless. You can be happy and depressed. You can also be angry and depressed. You can also be scared and depressed. Depression is more of a feeling of dejection and despondency, than it is emotionless.The ending is phenomenal. The scene where Riley enters the home actually made me feel so incredibly sad and happy at the same time. It is truly great cinema. Very impressed at Pixar pulling this off again. It puts itself on a list with Finding Nemo, Up and Toy Story 3.So why only a 7? While the plot of the real world Riley and the added touches Pixar throws in are great, the story of Joy trying to get back to headquarters is not as good. We fall into a repetition of ""there's only one way back to headquarters"" then ""oh no, that was destroyed, now we can't get back"" then ""there's only one other way back to headquarters"". This repeats about five times. It just got a little one note and, although it didn't become predictable, none of the revelations felt overwhelming.Overall, very much worth the watch. I cannot wait to rewatch it again. Great for kids and adults alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Guaranteed entertainment for the whole family,"A unique look into the mind where emotions are represented as characters in charge of what an individual feels. Directed by Pete Docter and Ronnie Del Carmen, Inside Out follows eleven-year-old Riley and her family moving from Minnesota to San Francisco, a decision that provokes a roller coaster of emotions in her.Away from her friends, from her school, and from everything she knows, young Riley experiences difficulties that pose a field day for the emotions inside her. Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust, and Sadness will try to do their best to help her by producing what only each one of them can. The premise is interesting and original enough to give this movie a chance. It is full of funny as well as profound, heartbreaking moments. Something Pete Docter is good at is creating stories that can perfectly be enjoyed both by children and adults. In Inside Out, the theme of emotions takes an expression where each one of them finds reification in a cute little anthropomorphic colored character working at a tower with a console full of buttons they have to manage to produce the desired effects. The emotions really live to what they represent. For instance, Joy, played by Amy Poehler, is always positive, extroverted, and happy, the carrier of hope and happiness, whereas Sadness, played by Phyllis Smith, portrays a gloomy, introverted, and pessimistic approach to everything. It would be easy to think of one of all those emotions being more important than the other because, at the end of the day, who would like to feel sad, right? But the movie doesn't judge and instead illustrates how every single one of them is needed to have a perfectly balanced state of mind. By doing that, it could be considered a very realistic approach to the theme instead of the often found in new-age positive thinking or the like.Inside Out is a movie for all ages that touches profound topics in an original, engaging, and fun way.

Everything you could expect from Pixar - almost,"This movie is definitely a return to form for Pixar. It has just about everything you want from them: Family Friendly (for the most part), a concept that has been done before but with a story that takes that concept to the next level, and story that will tug at your heartstrings.What is the story about? It's a story of an 11 year old girl named Riley who has been uprooted from Minnesota to live in San Francisco. However, we come to care about her through her emotions, mainly Joy and Sadness, which are personified. Belling the story through her emotions, Pixar is able take us through a journey of the mind.The animation, the voice, and the score are all spot on. My two criticisms, and these are really nitpicks, is that at times I could really feel the movie slow down and I wish they explored the different areas of the mind a bit more. I know slow moments are necessary, but it was noticeable. That said, when the movie was going, it was a wild ride of fun and emotion. I also wish they had explored the deeper recess of the mind a bit more, but I understand this might have made things too complicated for a film that us meant for a more general audience.If your kid is of a young age and gets restless easily, this likely isn't going to be a movie for him or her. However, this movie offers a great lesson to the young and old (one many adults tend to forget). This is actually a film I would say older kids and adults will get more out of, but I recommend it for anyone that can handle this type of movie.It's a wonderful film that the the family can enjoy and a great addition to the Pixar cannon. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A cute family movie, smart in many ways.","I saw Inside Out twice now, once at the theater and once at home, and I've learned to appreciate it on a couple of levels.First, just as a kids movie, it's pretty great. It has a simple enough plot for the family to enjoy, with lots of cute moments and jokes. Kids will love it obviously for the characters, and adults can get into the themes behind the action as well. The importance of family, spending time together, learning to deal with problems as a unit are all part of the story line as well. I think it's one of those films that families appreciate for keeping a lighthearted approach to difficult family topics, and some downright emotional moments that Pixar so excels at. So I think it deserves high praise. It's silly, but it's a smart kind of silly.Secondly, is how the plot, characters, and events all follow a theme of psychology. I was surprised at how many terms I had heard previously in my university classes. Short term, and long term memory storage, abstract thought and reasoning, and how people form their personality around core childhood memories. I was surprised at how well the story was blended together with that of our own minds and reflections. You have to wonder what goes on in your own mind, when you loose interest in lets say... a hobby, or a relationship, or grow apart from family as well.As Riley progresses through a major life change, she also follows some very specific stages of loss as well. I was caught up when I was noting the small changes in her personality as she hits different stages. Isolation at school, anger at home with her family, depression, and acceptance. Anyways, it was really interesting to catch those terms of the stages she goes through during the movie. I'm sure there are lot's more for the psychologists out there.So without giving away too much, this is a great addition to the Pixar repertoire. Fun for everyone.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"If you think this is original, I pity you","No. This is not an original idea. It is a done-to-death movie idea. It was done by Herman's Head, by Osmosis Jones, and by almost every ""Fantastic Voyage"" episode of God only knows how many Saturday morning cartoons.And all of them, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM, did it better than Inside Out.First of all, the characters. They are QUITE LITERALLY ONE-DIMENSIONAL. Instead of opting for personifications of complex concepts like the id and the ego or conflicting mindsets idealist, the pragmatist and the narcissist, Pixar chooses to dumb the concept down as much as possible and gives us personified emotions.The setting? Yes, it's beautifully animated, but again: It's nothing we haven't seen done before and done better, both with a better interpretation AND with more humor.The plot? What plot?There is literally not a single original idea in this entire movie. Even the imaginary friend, which should have been where Pixar flexed their creative muscles the most, looks like something they stole out of the Jim Henson Wing of the Puppet Museum.So what does that leave? The countless ""Easter egg"" references to other Pixar movies. Which, more and more, seem less like things they thought would be fun to throw in and more like an endless barrage of reminders that. . .THIS IS PIXAR AND THAT MEANS YOU STUPID SHEEP ARE SUPPOSED TO LOVE THIS CRAP!!!!And it's that last point that ultimately pisses me off the most, because the sad fact is that they probably don't even need to badger their audiences into thinking this crap is not crap.If any animation company other than Pixar had come out with this crap, it would have tanked at the box office hard enough to close the studio. But because it's Pixar, it's cleaning up at the box office, being lauded over by critic after critic for the ""originality"" of ideas that were shamelessly stolen, and will very likely walk away with yet another undeserved Oscar for Best Animated Feature.No, this is not a great movie. This is freaking crap. And if we don't call this movie out for the freaking crap that it is and stop giving Pixar money, praise and accolades no matter what kind of crap they give us, we can forget about ever seeing movies anywhere near the same quality as Up, The Incredibles or WALl-E ever again.",2.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Moving, Introspective, Non-maudlin emotions, Must Watch","As the usual Pixar movies, there is a small animation film 'Lava' before the main 'Inside Out' movie.Lava is a nice mix of emotions + comedy and gets the 'joy' emotion in the driver's seat of your brain.The movie is mainly about a young 11 year old girl and the different(joy, anger, fear, sadness etc.) emotions in her mind working together to keep herself going.The 1st half is wonderful and will keep you thinking about how human mind and emotions work.The starting part of 2nd half(10-15 mins.) felt a bit elongated and could be shortened.Nevertheless, I myself went through all the animated emotions felt by the protagonist on the screen.I was surprised that the PVR cinema had only 8 occupants on a Friday evening.Out of 8, 5 people left the hall before the ending credits. Guys, there are some rib- tickling moments through the ending credits so just sit for 5 more mins. instead of rushing out.I would keep this animation movie below Ratatouille which is my favorite Pixar movie. Anyways, it is always difficult to rate among the Pixar movies.In a nutshell, go out this weekend and watch this gem of a roller-coaster people.It is fun for children and adults alike.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of Pixar's top five.,"I was able to see an early screening of this movie and had heard that critics were calling it one of Pixar's best. After watching it, I would have to agree. The animation was great(as usual for Disney movies) and the storytelling was clear and easy to understand. But to me, the thing that would make or break this film is the comedy in it. And in my opinion, it was extremely funny. The characters(emotions) in the film are funny and memorable. One of my favorite characters is Riley's imaginary friend, Bing Bong(my favorite emotion is the hilarious Anger.) There are also certainly some touching moments in the movie but it is balanced with the comedy so as not to be too sappy. For me the only problem with the film is it's scope(the whole movie takes place in San Francisco except the very beginning) and lack of adventure (outside of the mind), but it makes up for it with creativity, comedy, and great storytelling and characters. I would rank this as one of Pixar's top five.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Love Letter to Classic Pixar Movies,"Inside Out is arguably the best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3; it brings a refreshing look that reminds us just what type of studio Pixar is. I was actually surprised by how mature some parts of this movie were. To make a shallow comparison, Inside Out is like Adventure Time in that it can awaken that childlike wonder and joy that you might lose in your daily life, while still making you mull over incredibly deep concepts. I think this is a movie that both adults and kids can watch, that it doesn't just cater to the whims of children, but rather respects, in a very much Toy Story way, how a child's view of the movie might develop as they grow up.As we've come to expect from Pixar, this movie is visually stunning. The close-up shots really capture emotion well in an animated film. The story takes you inside the head of a pre-adolescent girl, Riley, and personifies her emotions in a movie that is truly a breath of fresh air. Inside Out reminds me of the Pixar I knew as a kid, the studio that had amazing, original ideas and presented complex issues and a beautiful way. We come into a very difficult stage in Riley's life, and we are reminded just how easily your world can fall apart when you are so young. Inside Out really shows you the stress we all endured at that point in our lives, how youth can seem so fleeting and that at times it may seem like we've forgotten what joy was.Lastly, this movie made me cry. While not exactly the ""tear duct sledgehammer"" that Up was, Riley's character is strikingly relatable, which makes the movie hit deep in its own way. I rarely give movies a perfect score anymore. I rate movies on a adjectival system, meaning each number 1 through 10 has an adjective associated with it; a 5 is mediocre, a 6 is okay, a 7 is good, you get the idea. To me, a 10 is a masterpiece, a movie that beautifully does what it set out to do; while a 10 may not be perfect, it will definitely be remembered and looked to as a model. To me, Inside Out fits this description. I would recommend this movie to anyone who still has a little kid inside of them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"A funny, touching Disney Pixar.",A good little animated movie that takes many of the modern techniques of computerized animation and shows them off to full effect.

not for children,"poetic and metaphorical, this film is not for children. My five years old son had difficulties to explain to me the story of the movie afterward.of course is it full with ideas, like the explanation to the nervous breakdown, but is what the children need ?Only the parents laughed during the scene of the meal with the husband which does not listen and the memory of the Brazilian pilot.It was not a magical family moment for us. I like the idea to treat the children like adults able to understand grown up issues - but sometimes we need to relax and change our minds from the daily problems.6/10 for adults 1/10 for the children",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great Movie For Kids and Adults,"Inside Out is a sweet and original flick. It's unique story line definitely is what has driven people to watch it.It is a movie for all ages and although the story line isn't the most stimulating and brilliant movie for an adult, it still can be enjoyed by one and it is the perfect movie to take your kids too.The story line is cute and has a good moral throughout and really takes on a different edge of the mind of a child and adult that can be quite relatable to both.Overall this is a very good movie for kids and a satisfying enough movie for adults.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar is back,"Inside out is directed by Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen, starring Amy Pohler, Bill hader, Lewis Black. First off, inside out is one of Pixar's best films ever made. This is one of Pixar's most original ideas and they made everything so prefect, the movies is for all ages. Kids and parents will love this and for the kids it will teach them an important message about yourself. The story follows Riley and her emotions, Joy, Fear, Anger, disgust, and sadness. Thought the movie you see Riley have lots of emotions on moving to a different city, school, and many more things. The voice acting is great by everyone, Amy Pohler does a great job as joy and Lewis Black as Anger is just amazing casting. What made inside out an amazing movie was that it was about emotions and it managed to make you feel so many emotions though out the whole movie. Overall Inside out is a fun, touching movie with lots of depth to everything. Great for all ages. Definitely inside out is up there with the incredibles, toy story, and finding nemo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Awesome,"With the recent Pixar movies, it seems to me that they are putting more effort on trying to intrigue all ages not just only children anymore. This movie is about a young girl moving into a new city as her emotions navigate her decisions. One emotion which is Joy get into a conflict and is in search of a solution but while she is on this journey she learns a lot about Sadness and her part in the young girl life. As she evolves on this journey, as do the other emotions and the young girl. First off, the images and sound play a huge part in this movie as it adds all the emotions needed in the pictures. It gives us a different perspective in how our emotions bleed out to others and how creative we forget we can be. The director does well in this part as he gives different scenes that are out of this world mostly on Joy journey as you would not expect most of the stuff happening seeing greed, selfishness, and others which you wouldn't presume to happen in a ""young movie."" He gives you a different picture on life and how generally our society forgets how we could view it from all different sides. The director also actively engages the audience as Joy goes on a journey to rescue the girls Morals or Personality that she obtain throughout her life. Certainly A movie that made me tear up is a first as it is hard for a guy to cry sometimes. What could have been worked on is the music as it should really amplify more of the scene rather than a little aggression. Some felt like it was lackluster as it was a powerful scene. As for the voices of each character, I believe it was splendid as Angry had the right tone of voice and sarcasm. Disgust had this almost blonde personality but what really gave in was Bing Bong played by Richard King, he put so much emotion and thought in his voice that it felt so real in the movies. The usage of colors allows more eye candy in the different section of the movies that appealed to the audience giving them not a monotone view but at time vibrant for happy feeling and same suit color for sadness. Overall this movie 9/10 as there is some part that are a little off but the plot, character, and voices were on point. Other than that the movie is about 1 hour and 30mins giving it a perfect time for the plot to end, nothing I felt was rushed as everything flowed nicely. This movie oddly relates a lot to our daily lives as our emotions get in a way with a lot of our decision-making comprising some paths that we choose but also how we deal with other people in our daily lives. Our choices and voice make big decision in other views as working with others to make a better place.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Beautiful, touching animation","I am amazed to see so many negative reviews of this film. Please do not be put off by the negativity expressed by a few individuals on this site. When I was born, Disney and Pixar's first film 'Toy Story' was the number 1 movie in the UK. I am truly of the Pixar generation and I have to say that Inside Out is one of the greatest films that Pixar and even Disney have ever created - it is truly a masterpiece. The characters are delightful and charming (most surprising was how much I adored Sadness!) and the animation is breathtaking. Some have suggested that the storyline was too dark for children, however I don't feel that this is the case. The movie was the perfect balance of belly-laughs and tearful moments. Children in our theatre left looking so pleased, and so did me and my friends (aged 19-26). This is the perfect film for families, Disney lovers, and quite simply anyone who enjoys cinema that really makes you feel something.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not what I expected,"When i first saw the trailer, I was really excited to see it. I liked the concept of the movie, it was something that hasn't been done before. But it wasn't what I excepted*Warning:Careful for spoilers* The whole film they focused on the emotions, instead of Riley, the actual interesting character. The 'lead' emotions ,Joy and Sadness,were pretty annoying. But i liked the other 3 and wanted to see more of them but instead i got a very boring and slow adventure with Joy and Sadness. It was the worst part of the movie and it left like filler. The whole time when they were about to go back something occurred and were stuck there, again and again. It's predictable and annoying. But I liked the sacrifice of Bing Bong, that was an unexpected and emotional scene and it kinda waked me up after the boring scenesThe other parts of the film, were actually pretty good. The beginning with the whole explanation was nice and interesting and everything made sense. The ending were Rikey decides to walk away was also exciting, but for me it didn't make any sense because, where did she wanted to go? The scene were she starts to cry did nothing for me but the ending was nice, the funniest part was with the boy who had the 'girl alarm'.I give it a 7 for the great animation and the begin and end, but for the rest, it felt like a real bore.

"Fun, entertaining and mostly really smart.","Caught an early screening of this at Cinemateket, Oslo. Nice! Because it premieres here in late August. Wah-wah.Having seen several good reviews and scores, I went into this expecting something pretty great. Albeit, I also heard great things about Up and Toy Story 3, which I found to be overrated, but in this case, what was said, was mostly true.This movie has a lot of really smart writing. The main idea is really good, and all the small details are super fun, the story in general, as in plot is nothing too special, but it works.But as I said, what really makes this stand out is the smartness of a lot of the jokes and ideas. The big jokes, main jokes, if you will, I didn't find all that funny, but the small details, those made me chuckle. A chuckle that both said: that's pretty funny, and wow that's really smart.Funny thing, a couple of times during the movie I thought to myself, 'ah, so that's how my brain works'. Haha, then followed by, 'no wait, we know emotions aren't tiny creatures living in our brains'.. right? My point being, it's really plausible and well made.The animation is of course superb, didn't expect anything less. The voice cast is also top notch.I did find a couple of things with the script to be a little lazy, actually, and really felt it took the movie down a notch. I was rather surprised at some parts, well one in particular, giving the fact that most of the movie is so smart.I had heard that it was supposed to be very sad, or touching in some parts, but it didn't really get to me as much as I'd hoped.(not trying to be tough here, I love being touched and sad by movies)All in all this is a well made, entertaining, smartly written (for the most part) movie with heart.

There should be more movies like this, where there has actually been some thought put into the film. During the movie it is evident that personal memories are important and influence who we are and how our emotions effects our memories.

Good,"It must be admitted that the vast majority of people do not have the opportunity to grow up overnight. We may have an epiphany for something and understand a truth, but this truth needs to be constantly verified over a long period of time before it can ultimately become a part of our growth. So the chicken soup for the soul is a very scary thing, it crosses the process of polishing and directly throws us a so-called ""universal"" truth, but that truth cannot achieve ""me"". Some truths and growth can only be understood after truly experiencing them.This self growth has always been the main theme of Pixar Animation.Of course, this kind of growth is not achieved overnight, so there are so many ""total mobilizations"" in Pixar's animation family. They always use something that requires exploration to slowly delve into their hearts, and then let the protagonist of the story naturally realize that life should be like this.As for the anime ""Brain Agents"", to use the chicken soup point, it is to accept one's negative emotions and accept the complete self.This should be a very strange thing. Because each of us was taught in our childhood that we should be lively, enthusiastic, outgoing, and generous people, as if this is the correct way to open up our lives. And how much a child's life needs to rely on 'right' to live. Correct answers to exercises, correct speech and behavior, correct expression... Therefore, being lively and cheerful has become the ""moral correctness"" of one's personality.So at the beginning of 'Mind Corps', the dominant factor was' happiness'. She worked hard to digest every possible negative emotion, using various positive examples to make Lily think positively when faced with setbacks. This is an optimistic attitude towards life, which is enjoyable; But sadness seems to have been making mistakes all along. She touched on happy memories, which made Lily depressed.

A strong return to form for Disney Pixar.,"Inside Out is the latest animated feature film by Disney Pixar. After their previous three movies (Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University) failed to impress me, naturally my expectations were quite low. However, this worked to my advantage because I can say that this is one of the best films they have ever made. It represents a strong return to form from the legendary animation studio.Riley Anderson is a young girl who lives a happy life with her loving parents and friends in Minnesota. Guiding her through life are Riley's personified emotions; Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust and Anger. However, at the age of eleven, Riley and her parents relocate to San Francisco after her father finds a new job there. This change in location and atmosphere comes as a shock to young Riley and her emotions desperately try to help her cope with living in a new city, going to a new school and trying to make new friends, with sometimes disastrous results.This is one of the most clever, poignant, touching and original films that Pixar have made to date. I loved the concept of how the emotions in our heads know what is best for us and are trying to navigate us through life. Also, its moving story about acceptance and change will strike a chord with anyone who has moved someplace different and have tried to fit in and adjust to a new life. I would even rank it alongside Up and the Toy Story films in terms of how emotional it can get. My only real issue is that some of the film's themes may be too complex for really young viewers but I guess as long as their parents are with them to explain some of the more difficult to understand concepts then there shouldn't be a problem.I rate it a solid 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar Returns to Form with yet another Masterpiece,"I was always anticipating Inside Out. I knew that sooner or later Pixar would be back on track making great movies once again. I was not a huge fan of their past few works (Namely, Brave and Cars 2). Also, some of the trailers for Inside Out didn't really do it for me. Some of the jokes seemed forced and the slapstick humor seemed to be aimed a kids. Boy was I wrong!This movie was phenomenal. Everything worked for me in this film. It's the most I've ever been touched by an animated film since the beginning of Up. Also, this is one of the funniest Pixar movies to date. The slapstick humor (what little there is) blended perfectly with the surprisingly larger amount of more adult humor.The story follows a young girl, Riley, as she is uprooted from her home in Minnesota and has to move to San Francisco. Simultaneously, the story focuses on the five emotions (Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger, and Disgust) in her head, and when Joy and Sadness get accidentally shot out of headquarters an adventure ensues that shows Joy and Sadness's journey back to headquarters. The story is perfect for both younger and older audience members because it is so relatable. Anyone who has ever felt any kind of emotion will be any to relate to Riley and what she is feeling.As for the cast, this is one of the best ensemble casts I've seen in a while. Specifically, Lewis Black as Anger. That is the definition of perfect casting. Furthermore, none of the emotions outshine the others, they all get their fair share of laughs. Even the emotion I was most worried about, Disgust, voiced by Mindy Kaling, had me laughing. The rest of the casting, consisting of Amy Poehler as Joy, Bill Hader as Fear, and Phyllis Smith as Sadness, all were nearly flawless with their voice acting.Overall, Inside Out is another masterwork from Pixar and is easily the front-runner already for the Best Animated Feature category at the Oscars and maybe even Best Picture. This film met all my expectations and gloriously surpassed them. It also has me looking forward to The Good Dinosaur, another film by Pixar coming out later this year.""These are my kind of people.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The real Pixar returns to revive it's inventive glory!,"Astonishing animation. Inventive and complex concept. Perfect voice acting. That is the formula of Pixar that is used in almost every film Pixar has ever produced. However, after Toy Story 3 came out, the formula isn't really used properly in Cars 2, Brave and Monsters University. Just when we thought it's the end of the glory of Pixar we fell in love with, Pete Docter's Inside Out came along in Summer of 2015 and thanks to critical acclaim, it revived Pixar's glory using the formula as perfect as our favourite Pixar movies. The movie was simply splendid and clever and undoubtedly one of the best films 2015 has to offer. Of course, there are other stuff that has a same idea this movie does. (Like the Numskulls) But, I think this movie stands out the most.Anyway, let's dive into the film. The film takes place in a mind of a 11-year-old girl named Riley, who is controlled by 5 emotions, Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear. Inside her mind, all the places represent Riley's personality and the place called Headquarters, where the emotions live, is where emotions and recent memories come to Riley.Surprisingly, there's a lot of things to go through about this movie but it's worth it! Starting off with the concept, many things in the centre of the concept are genius like emotions use these crystal ball like memories to make Riley remember moments from the past and there's the place where Riley's dreams were made and those dreams are screened at Headquarters for the emotions to watch like a movie. That is so smart! The animation is simply amazing and it really deserves an achievement. The glow on Joy makes me question how the animators do that on a character. Speaking of the characters, all 5 emotions in Riley's mind are probably one of Pixar's most lovable characters in an original film. Disgust is well designed, Anger and Fear are really funny, Sadness is well voice acted by Phyllis Smith and Joy is my personal favourite character in this film. She's chucklesome, cute, admirable and Amy Poehler is perfect for the voice acting!Now, the story. I won't tell you the story because I want to keep the anticipation in you if you want to see this movie. Overall, the story delivered a lot of scenes with different emotion states. There are some happy moments, there are funny moments, there are moments that might as well leave you shedding tears quite easily. I didn't cry but it moderately hit me.Inside Out is one of the best Pixar films ever made and I highly recommend it. If you love Toy Story, Finding Nemo and Up, I'm sure that you'll never be disappointed with this one since it has a clever concept, brilliant voice acting and most importantly, impressive animation!We beg you Pixar to keep this glorious journey of inventiveness and emotion going. Keep it up, Pixar. Don't let us down ever again!Film Score: 10/10 - Masterpiece",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Incredible characteristic settings,"Inside out will be my best comic movie in 2015 as for the incredible settings for a person's characteristic. The movie combined so many element together and doing this in a splendid way. We all know that when a baby first come to the new world the baby is always crying, but as we saw, Riley came to this world with the first emotion, joy,I like this cause I just felt that it's great to come to the world,but then sadness comes and makes me cry. That's why baby is crying. And when we were younger,our feelings and emotions toward a thing is much more clear,happy or sad or angry or disgust or scare,but when we grow older,the feelings and emotions became complex,we are not just happy or sad or angry or disgust or scare toward something but more like to be some feelings or emotions combined together,because we are getting older and the feelings won't be clear as the old times,that's what grow told us. The trailer is so fun it told us about the people Riley met and how the 5 emotions in their head controls them,but psychologically we know that emotion is not can be simply divided into five but is far more bigger than this amount, but the five in the movie is fine enough to explain all the things. Thought train won't work when we were sleeping,the clown is so scared, dream was actually made by the people in our head and cloud town,all of this is so fun. And lastly, we all once had a bingbong in our head, but after we grow up we just left bingbong behind our memory.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A original creative animation movie,"Tonight I took my niece to go see Inside Out because she asked me to and being the good uncle I took her.Turns out that the movie is actually pretty creative and has a original plot that is not too often these days.This is the 5th film I saw in theaters this year and turns out to be worth your while.I am not giving anything away because this is a movie you have to watch to better understand it because it does so much to be original and it does well for it.First let's talk about the cast Riley (Voiced Kaitlyn Dias) with the voices in her head: Joy (Voiced by Amy Poehler), Sadness (Voiced by Phyllis Smith), Fear (Voiced by Bill Hader), Anger (Voiced by Lewis Black), Disgust (Voiced by Mindy Kaling) along with her parents Mom (Diane Lane) Dad (Kyle MacLachlan) along with Bing Bong (Richard Kind).Pixar once again showcases their talents for bringing animation to life and it really shows it in this film. The movie is just amazing to look at and the emotion characters are very well design, you can see the real effects of the animation as it present itself on screenThe voice acting is really strong in this one as you can tell in the voice work that everyone wanted to bring the film to the dance Amy's performance is one of the best examples of brilliant voice acting and Kaitlyn's talented work as well is good. They all show real interest in making this movie when you listen to their voice work you can respect the energy of their performance'sInside Out has such a original story that only is best described to seeing the movie on the big screen because the story is clever and you will get good character development throughout the film with a lot of thinking that goes along with this movie.It really gets into your emotions, with a few tearful moments what comes out of this movieTrust me you should take the family to see Inside Out it is worth your timeWith great animation, impressive voice work and a character driven story there is nothing that holds PIXAR back it is one of their best works of animation that ranks out there with Toy Story, Cars among othersI give Inside Out an 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good Movie! I don't know why people think kids won't understand it!,"When I first seen the previews for this movie I did not want to see it, but I'm glad that I did. This has been one of the best animated movies that I have seen in a while. Contrary to what some reviews say, I believe that this movie is perfectly suitable for younger kids. People underestimate what kids can understand. I am a Pre-K teacher (teaching 3-4 year olds and some 5), and they understand that they have emotions and that their emotions make them feel different ways. In fact discussing emotions is one of the first lessons that we talk about, and almost everyday we talk about how each other is feeling for any particular day and how its okay for us to have emotions. Sure there where some parts in the movie that might be a little to complex for them to understand, but in reality when kids watch movies they hardly ever understand everything in the movie. For example, we watch The Lorax for a movie day at school, and I had to explain to the kids at the end about recycling and taking care of the earth why it's important and how it helps the earth, because most of them came away with a different understanding. But that's part of growing up and maturing, I can watch movies now that I watched when I was younger and get a completely different understand, because I know more now and I understand more. I don't think the previews did this movie justice at all. There where some depressing parts (I even teared up some), but the movie had a wonderful plot and story line. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Inside Out,"Maybe the animated characters are not so likable, but the whole movie is full of imagination. It seems to give rationality to many ideas and behaviors in our daily lives.

Why all the negativity? think positive!,"There's a lot of negative reviews for this movie here, and to be honest I felt the same while watching this film, but by the end not so much:) . I put off this movie for awhile, though everyone said it was great. And I finally go to watch it and it stresses me the f out! Like literally, it had me feeling all the emotions... It's not a bad Pixar film though... This movie makes you feel. If it didn't do that for you, well you mustn't have any core memories. Lol No Seriously rarely is there a movie that makes you feel as if you've grown as a person for watching it, so watch this movie .......my review is too short so I'll add that each emotion is clearly going to have its flaws AND strengths, that's the whole point of the film (tiny spoiler) joy thinking sadness would ruin everything but sadness was compelled to do what she did because she knew Riley needed to go through it, and joy didn't understand that having thought she needed to be happy all the time, by the end we see that's too stressful of a burden and that we all need to feel all the emotions. And this movie makes you do just that, don't lie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good film,"A girl named Riley is living happily with her family in Minnesota. Her goofy and friendly personality is thanks to the emotion that runs her the most, Joy (played by Amy Poehler). She works with the other emotions, Fear (played by Bill Hader), Anger (played by Lewis Black), Disgust (played by Mindy Kaling), and not so much with Sadness (played by Phyllis Smith) to ensure that Riley remains that happy kid she is. But as with life, every kid has to come to their first big event that begins their journey into a full human. In this case it's a move.Riley's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco, and the emotions are having a hard time figuring out the best reaction. Joy would like to continue for Riley to stay happy, but Sadness starts to have the effect of changing past memories from happy to sad. A fight between Joy and Sadness causes them to be sent to long term memory, leaving the other emotions to run Riley. The child clearly has trouble adapting to the big city life and starts to shut herself out, even considering running away. Joy and Sadness must get back to headquarters to fix Riley, but Joy may not know what's best for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Brilliantly inventive but not the 10/10 of the trailer,"Pixar excel in making multi-layered films that can be enjoyed by kids and adults in equal measure. They have also developed a truly astonishing ability to tap into a parent's deepest emotions, such that while their kids were quietly enjoying the first few minutes of ""Up""; Jessie's song from ""Toy Story 2"" or Andy leaving for college in ""Toy Story 3"", their parents were sobbing hopelessly into their sleeves. Inside Out, the new Pixar animation, is a very subtle case in point. And it's also far too clever to be wasted on kids.Inside Out chronicles the middle-class trauma of 11-year old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) who has to leave the bucolic charms of Minnesota (did she never see ""Fargo""?) to be dragged to the uncultured wasteland of San Francisco, and forced to cope with the 'horrors' of a new house, a new school, yada, yada. So far, so yawn. Except that we experience all of this through the emotions in Riley's head brought vividly to life by Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear. Sitting – Star Trek Enterprise style – at a console somewhere behind Riley's forehead, they watch what's going on and control her emotions to suit.When things go badly awry, Joy and Sadness are pitched out of the control room and dumped into the depths of Riley's long term memory (an area bearing a shockingly multi-coloured resemblance to the Hall of Prophecies in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix""). With no joy or sadness in her life, how can Riley cope? There follows a desperate mission to return Joy and Sadness to the HQ, aided and abetted by Riley's long-lost imaginary friend Bing Bong, before her life is permanently wrecked by bad decisions.Let's start with the positives on this film. Inside Out is enormously inventive. If the Indiana Jones series drove an interest in kids doing degrees in Archaeology, then the same could happen for Psychology as a result of this movie. At the very least, you can see how kids with issues of anger management or depression could really get genuine value out of this simple movie by visualising and therefore understanding their problems better. The sociological impacts of the movie might actually be quite profound.All the leading actors lend their voices to very believable characters, with Diane Lane (Martha Kent from ""Man of Steel"") and Twin Peak's own Kyle MacLachlan also being very effective in voicing Riley's Mom and Dad respectively. The animation team do a splendid job in rendering both the wild excesses of Riley's brain and the seedier foggy streets of San Francisco.Michael Giacchino again comes up trumps with a moving and highly effective score.And that trailer. Boy, that trailer! If I ever wanted to see a film more this year after viewing a trailer, it was this one. Brilliantly zipping from Riley's brain to the Mom's brain to the Dad's brain and back again, and making ""Brazilian helicopter pilot"" a defining synonym for day-dreaming and lustful women.Unfortunately, and slightly disappointingly for me, this sequence was also the best bit of the film. We spend 90% of the rest of the film inside Riley's head. And whilst there are wildly inventive moments in that world – for example, while she sleeps, the day's memories are being dispatched to long term memory, and the Hollywood style movie studio kicks into dream productions – some of this running time is borderline dull. Whilst kids will no doubt remain mesmerised by the antics, the comic potential of the interplay between the emotions in different people's brains is barely tapped again. (Almost in recognition of this lapse, we get treated to a very amusing mid-credits sequence zipping in and out of human and animal brains). If there is a sequel to the film (and it's notable that the console ""puberty"" button was never hit), then with any luck John Lasseter will instruct his team to provide more of this type of content: there is comedy gold to be mined there.On possibly a purely personal note I was also rather distracted by the animation of the hair of Joy and Sadness: perhaps it worked better in 3D than 2D, but it looked to be a bad photoshop paste effect to me.As I mentioned up front, the film is subtly moving. An important lesson it teaches ('teaches' like being hammered round the head with a candy-covered truncheon) is that it's ""OK to be sad sometimes"". Do you remember the time around age 11 or 12 where you grew up just enough that Christmas Day didn't seem QUITE as thrilling and exciting as it did when you were 6? And didn't that cause those joyful present-opening ""core memories"" to be tinged ever so slightly with a haze of nostalgic sadness? This film amplifies those feelings through a prism of faint regret, and older viewers should be prepared to shed a tear or too over the lost joys of years gone by. The genetic code of ""Up"" was clearly preserved in amber and emerging at random. You have been warned.So in summary, ""Inside Out"" is a great film and well deserving of your cinema dollar, but perhaps a smidgen disappointing in its execution when set against the overall marketing hype, and particularly the bar set by that glorious trailer. It will still make a fortune for Disney and Pixar though, and good luck to them.Finally, the Pixar short – Lava - tells the musical story of an old Pacific volcano seeking the love of his life, and is an animated delight that had me grinning from ear to ear.

Worst Pixar Movie Ever!,"I just got home from seeing Inside Out with my wife. We both thought it was the absolute worst movie Pixar has ever done.I am a huge fan of Pixar's movies - they've done so many that are so astoundingly good, it's hard to say which one is the best. This movie, on the other hand, easily qualifies as their worst ever. No charm, no humor, no engaging, memorable characters. I kept waiting and waiting for the story to become what other Pixar movies have had - at least some humor or charm or something compelling to keep you watching. It had none of these things. It was a sad, depressing, boring, lackluster affair from start to finish. I'm truly amazed that so many people have found this to be one of Pixar's best efforts. It doesn't even come close to the Toy Story movies, A Bug's Life or my favorite, Finding Nemo. On a scale of 1 to 10, IMHO, Inside Out isn't even on the scale.If you're thinking about going to see it, don't waste your money! A truly awful effort from a company that has set the bar incredibly high and failed, miserably, to live up to that bar.Hugely disappointing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Best Pixar ever,"In my fifties, i have always been a great pixarfan, from the start. Toy Story 3, Up, Ratatouille (amongst others) all knew how to be warm without being corny, funny but never going for cheap laughs, wise and intelligent without being patronizing. This movie however added a lot to the already impressive list of Pixar qualities. The visualization of our mental faculties was so smartly done(if i was to teach psychology i would start the course with this picture), the humor was sometimes so surrealistic and weird, the emotions stayed so well in character ;-), the craft that was necessary to make this was overwhelming. My son asked me to name movies of comparable genius and i had a hard time naming one. Or i have to compare apples and oranges, which i won't do here. (animated movies that come to mind here, right now are Spirited Away and Mary and Max) Anyway, without exaggerating, this was a work of art that makes life worth living",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Inside Out: An interesting look on what if feelings had feelings?,"Pixar's latest film tells the story of Riley by showing us exactly what's inside her mind. There we meet Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust, who operate ""Riley Headquarters"" and don't always agree. Joy is the voice of reason, always wanting to keep Riley happy, while the other feelings are repeatedly stepping on each other's toes to control Riley's emotional response. The banter between feelings will have you laughing out loud for most of the beginning of the movie. Everything in Riley's life is going great until her family decides to move. This move drives 11-year-old Riley into emotion overload, and we as the audience get to see this firsthand. Joy and Sadness are tossed into the deep recesses of Riley's mind, where the ""Alice in Wonderland"" type of fantasy is happening. The jokes are great, the story really interesting. The middle lags a bit, but overall, the movie is an interesting new take on a young girl's emotions.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"A fresh new idea from Pixar, appealing to both kids and adults.","In their early years of feature film production, fans would flock to see the newest Pixar film. From toys to monsters, to fish, to superheroes, Pixar never failed to deliver a fun, creative idea. In recent years, however, the production company has found itself in the sequel race that has overtaken the box office. After disappointing sequels to Monsters Inc. and Cars, and a princess story that didn't grasp in Brave, along with Disney's success with their own 3D animation, we are forced to face the question: Is Pixar losing their touch? Pixar now returns with Inside Out, a refreshing new idea that will leave few to doubt that Pixar can create a fresh, creative idea.On the surface, we aren't given much as to the depth of this film. The idea that we all have these little characters of emotion in our heads is creative, but one can't but wonder: ""Can a whole film ride on this idea?"" Rest assured that this film has a lot more depth than shown in its promotions.Inside Out tells the story of five different emotions: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust, who operate the command center that is the mind of Riley, a young girl from Minnesota. When Riley's family moves to San Francisco, California, the emotions must work together to help the young girl cope with growing up and transitioning into a new home. Directors Pete Docter (Monsters Inc., Up), and first time feature director Ronaldo Del Carmen certainly deliver the fun and emotion that fans should expect from a Pixar film.Pixar paints an excellent juxtaposition between the mundane human world and the complexity of the human mind. One the outside, the film presents a very drab setting to Riley's San Francisco life, an uncharacteristic setting of the normally captivating Pixar. The mind, however, is a vibrant world that is an excellent blend of organic, mechanical, industrial and fantasy all while maintaining the core of neurology.Audiences will enjoy the colorful cast of characters (both literally and figuratively). While remaining confined in a single emotion, the emotion characters are still dynamic enough to develop throughout the film. As for the human characters in which these emotions inhabit, they are only shown in glances throughout the film, yet they are given the depth which makes them accessible to the audience. The film also delivers on its casting. Who else could encompass Joy better than the bubbly Amy Poehler? Or who could show the rage of Anger better than the ranting Lewis Black?Where Inside Out, shows its weakness is through the film's lack of aggressiveness in humor. Its jokes are definitely geared towards the older viewers. The jokes hit the nail right on the head in precision, but at times the delivery is so subtle that it can be easy to miss.Pixar delivers in a unique way in Inside Out. Straying from traditional Disney adventure, the film's conflict is not rooted by an antagonist. Instead it is driven by the compassion that it presents to the limitations and difficulty of human nature. It is a colorful adventure for kids all while delivering an emotional roller coaster that adults can relate to.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Return to Form,"What an astounding comeback for Pixar after about 5 years of disappointments they show they haven't lost they're touch. Pixar brings us another unique idea with unique characters. The characters that stand out are Joy, Sadness, and Anger who are brilliantly casted and did amazing jobs of bringing the characters to life. This is without a doubt Pixar's best film in years. The only negative I can say about it is the story is a little overdone and I've seen it many times before. But that is a minor issue barely worth mentioning. In the end I look forward to watching this film over and over again. Inside and out. Here are the grades I give it.

Needs a Trigger warning,"This movie needs a warning that it is not suitable for those suffering from Depression.I suffer from depression as a result of PTSD.

Looking at the movies playing at my local cinema, there was a choice of two. I saw a warning about Graphic Violence on ""Spy"" and decided it would be suitable, but having seen the trailer for ""Inside Out"" and being a huge Disney fan, I decided to go see it.The movie was so hard on me, my Service Dog spent half the movie trying to pull me out of the theatre. She does that when she feels that my PTSD has been triggered.I have discussed the movie with several other Service Dog handlers, and they have thanked me for the warning, as well as with friends I know suffer from depression, or have family members who do.They MUST put a warning on this movie that it may trigger emotional response in patients with Depression. I am thankful for my Service Dog and support network, because I came out of the movie an emotional disaster.

Not as great as it could have been,"Let me start by saying I am the queen of animated movies. My husband and I adore them (pretty much why I married the guy) and we rarely see movies in theaters so I'm extremely glad we waited for it to come out on DVD...because we were kinda let down by this one! I was so excited to see it, and maybe that was my own fault for having high expectations...but by no means did I NOT enjoy it, I just thought they could have done it wayy better.First of all, the movie was seriously lacking in comedy. Half the reason why we love animated movies so much is cuz they usually make us laugh! Think Big Hero 6...DYING! And for a movie that has Lewis Black and Amy Poehler, it should have been littered with comedy gold. I think we chuckled, at best, about 4 times.Don't get me wrong, it has all the feels...I was crying throughout the entire film. Not in a depressing way, but they definitely address emotional stages anyone that's had a traumatic event will immediately recognize and relate to. Having just gone through some pretty traumatic events in the past few weeks and diagnosed with PTSD because of it, my tear ducts were ready for battle.Also, like some people stated, I feel like there are way more emotions than just those 5. I also didn't feel like disgust was truly an emotion...more of an opinion. But Disgust was actually the character I liked best, in the end.In conclusion, I didn't outright dislike the movie by any means...I would totally watch it again, but it's not even close to my top favorites.

Absolutely nothing of interest for an adult male.,"There have been plenty of cartoon-movies that, even though they weren't geared toward me, at least had something of interest.

Boring, annoying, and extremely childish movie. Sure a very small child might like it. Maybe women like the concept of these battling emotions.

The Best Pixar Movie.,"I thought no Pixar movie would beat it's first- Toy Story. It took 2 full decades of film making but they did it- with Inside Out.I saw this 11 months ago when I was at a tech school for a month. It was my first time away from home and I was very emotional. Many movies I saw helped me for a short while, but none of them did that more than this.Our main character, Riley, has 5 emotions in her head: Joy, Anger, Fear, Disgust, and most importantly, Sadness. They all struggle with each other when Riley has to move away to a new home.I am surprised to see 57 current reviews giving this 1 star. Many claim it's boring. Compared to what? Most kid movies are silly-take that Emoji Movie that came out. I did not see it, but it looked pretty dumb and worthless.Some have said that it's too complex. Perhaps I should have mentioned this earlier, but this may be best for older audiences, like The Hunchback of Notre Dame. It's a movie that older audiences can connect with more. This isn't exactly for toddlers, but grade schoolers and up should see this.I cannot think of another Pixar film I would want to give more in-depth praise to. I would love to see more animated features like this. Our society needs it.Inside Out is not just a great animated movie but one of the best movies I have seen in recent years.

Everything about Inside Out was great, I adore this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the best animated movies of all time.,"Inside Out is the newest Pixar movie and also one of their best ever,which clearly means that this movie is something special. This movie is about Riley,an 11 year old girl from Minnesota who loves Hockey and lives happily with her mom and dad.But everything falls apart when they move to San Francisco,where she has to deal with a new house,and new school where she needs to make new friends and her emotions Joy,Sadness,Fear,Anger and Disgust guide her through these life changing events.Though,affected by these changes,Sadness makes a few mistakes that end up with her and Joy,into the far reaches of Riley's mind and with only Fear,Anger and Disgust left to the head quarters to guide Riley and to try and maintain positive thinking. First off to begin with,the emotions and their voice cast in this movie is all around perfect.Starting with Joy,voiced by Amy Poehler,Fear by Bill Hader,Disgust by Mindy Kaling,Anger by Lewis Black and Sadness by Phyllis Smith.They all do a masterful job in here,giving the right voice ""emotion"" to their emotions. Pete Docter is the director of this movie,he previously directed Monsters Inc,which I truly love,and Up,which is my all time favorite animated movie.This guy is a genius at this.He has mastered the art of the animation so well now that everything he does,its perfect. I really liked the way the world inside the mind was presented.I think they found new and interesting ways to show that to us and to impress us.The animation is gorgeous as every other Pixar movie ever,but what makes this movie great,it is the story,that its special and amazing.It is also very funny and will most certainly brings tears of joy (literally) to those who watch it. Kids should see this movie,because they will have fun and marvel at the animation,and laugh at the jokes in it.They will also learn about emotions and about what makes us human as a whole.But quiet frankly,in my opinion this movie is targeted more to adults,because of its thematic and interesting plot and I am pretty sure that adults will get the best of this movie,which is a weird thing to say about an animation,but then again,this is Pixar and you can except anything from these miracle workers. I honestly cried like 3 times in this movie,which is to be expected from this director,after that truly sad and masterpiece of a movie that he made before this,Up,and from what I heard,a lot of people cried also which is an astonishing achievement for the crew. I read an article on how Psychiatrists around the world are really loving this movie,which can clearly tell you just how amazing and well thought Inside Out is.They are saying that kids should definitely see this movie and that it can teach them a lot about emotions which is a hard thematic discussion to have for adults with their children. This is a stunning and original movie,also by far the best Pixar movie since Toy Story 3,and in my opinion,in Top 3 of all time Pixar movies.Everyone should watch this movie and I hope that it gets nominated for Best Picture,as Pixar's two earlier movies (Up and Toy Story 3).",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Excellent !,"I just saw this movie last night and I immensely enjoyed it. I am not sure if kids would enjoy it as much, since a lot of the dialogue requires some knowledge that might not be for kids. I did not understand why so many of the reviewers said it was a sad movie. I thought that it was an emotional movie, but in no way sad. It is a story about growing up and this, by definition, has bitter sweet moments - that's the point of the movie. It's not a comedy movie and I don't understand why so many people complained that they did not laugh enough. I thought almost all concepts presented were funny, but still I would not say the point of the movie was to get belly laughs. But come on, there are so many nice and subtle fun comments. I totally recommend this movie, if you are the kind that enjoys cartoons and if you are not looking for belly laughs, but for a nice, warm, funny , smart story !",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great Movie. No matter what Terastas writes....,"This review is in response to that horribly negative TROLL from Massachusetts which goes by the moniker ""Terastas."" I realize your sad little life hiding behind a computer monitor or smart-phone is all you have in the world, but you should be more supportive of original ideas like ""Inside Out."" First of all, this is a FAMILY movie. Pixar has mastered the art of movie-making that is highly enjoyable for the entire family. I understand you are either still a child or do not have any children, but let me assure you that millions of parents are thankful for Pixar for making films that simultaneously stimulate their children while entertaining their parents on a completely different intellectual level.Secondly, ""Inside Out"" might not be a completely original concept, but then again neither are talking insects, monsters, toys, or the myriad of other usually inanimate, unintelligent, or mythical beings that movie studios have anthropomorphized for our entertainment.Thirdly, the characters you so proudly labeled ""one dimensional"" and ""dumbed down"" because they weren't complex feelings or higher levels of thought processing represent the four basic emotions that control human thought. Remember, this is still an animated, FAMILY movie and not an avant-garde art-house film. Would you prefer characters such as ""Sociopath"" or ""Bizarre Fetish Man"" instead of Joy, Fear, Sadness, and Anger? Tarastas, I, too, feel that many of the average American moviegoers are simply sheep. And I'm absolutely sure that movie company executives think the same. If they didn't they wouldn't continue bombarding theaters with the same regurgitated crap that they've been doing for the past 15 or so years. Today, at the theater, while suffering through trailer after horrible trailer waiting on the feature presentation to begin, I noticed nearly every trailer was for a film that has either been ""reimagined"" or from an existing film franchise. The point I am trying to get across is that at least Pixar is still putting out quality movies that are well written as well as visually stunning.Bottom line: ""Inside Out"" is a great film and an interesting concept with a good message. So call off the dogs, Terastas.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Grade: A-,"When I first heard the concept of Inside Out, it didn't make any sense to me; it just didn't sound like anything that could be made into a film. The early trailer showed that the execution would be possible with the emotions being represented by different characters. Walking into the movie theater though, the doubt came back. How on Earth do you make a movie about characters that are designed to be one- note?As soon as Joy, voiced by Amy Poehler, came on screen, my confidence was restored. Her uplifting personality, though it could have been an obnoxious comedy device, instead allows the audience to view life with a sense of awe that only a child can experience. Vicariously, the audience is able to revisit childhood literally through the lens of a girl through which we see the world. But Joy is not the only emotion inside her.Soon Fear (voiced hilariously by Bill Hader) joins in, and then Anger (voiced by scene-stealer Lewis Black), and Disgust (a rather forgettable character and odd choice for a primary emotion, voiced by Mindy Kaling), and Sadness are part of the group that controls how this young girl sees the world. Sadness appears to be the antagonist- though she is funny, all the memories stored inside that she touches become sad memories, and she can't seem to help herself.In an attempt to save an important memory, Sadness and Joy get lost inside the girl's mind, leaving the controls to Anger, Fear and Disgust, and these characters manipulate this girl during a critical event in her life, and everything seems to fall apart. For every step forward Sadness and Joy take, they fall two steps back.The way that Disney/Pixar presents the different aspects of the mind are hilarious, clever, and easy to understand (ex: two boxes of facts and opinions, respectively, fall to the floor, and without sorting through them, they throw facts and opinions back into the boxes, mixing the two up). A hilarious running gag throughout the film about a catchy jingle makes for many laughs throughout. The film toys with abstract concepts and delivers one of the weirdest scenes in a Disney/Pixar movie. And the addition of a former imaginary friend, voiced delightfully by Richard Kind, provides both laughs and many heartfelt moments of forgotten childhood.As funny and original as I found Inside Out to be, I couldn't help but feel the movie tugging too hard at the heartstrings. Too many times did a character pick up a memory and look on it fondly with tears in their eyes; too many times did a character make progress, only to be shot across the girl's mind somewhere further from their destination. Instead of feeling sad, like it was clearly intended, I felt frustrated. And while the movie was filled with genuine, heartbreaking emotion, it tried just a few too many times to make me feel nostalgic. Children may find the movie either too serious or too sad, and adults may find it too deliberate and manipulative.Despite this, Inside Out is far from being a failure. While very little actually happens in the outside world in regards to plot, the weight of the actions that do happen are felt so much more because we understand the complicated emotions under the surface. Inside Out is the type of movie that shouldn't work; one-note characters that state exactly what the character is feeling and why, and yet, it's pulled off with this effortless magic that only Disney/Pixar seems to be able to achieve in a decade that's been slightly less fruitful than the past two for the company. The movie not only overcomes the obstacles inherently built into the script, but it transcends the problem of one-note characters and gives more character dimension than most films. Inside Out is arguably the best Disney/Pixar movie since Toy Story 3.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Torture for parents,"I know there are lots of good reviews. The trailer looked good. Kids wanted to see it. But to be honest found it pretty boring and a waste of money. Where to start, well its an American movie. Just watch the trailer, there isn't much more to it than the trailer, intact its best parts are in the trailer. It goes round in circles. Honestly for movies like this there should be a warning for parents that it may cause severe boredom. Anyway as cartoons go I suppose its fine.lacks laugh out loud humor and its lazy animation is disheartening. Pixar films are known to pack an emotional punch and this doesn't have any of that. All it has to offer is a misguided heart that is visually displeasing.",1.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Joy and Sadness,"Inside Out is one of the most daring films for children - and for adults as well - that I can think of from Hollywood, in the sense that it tells the audience ""look, not only can you be sad sometimes, you NEED to be sad"". That may be the ultimate takeaway, but it permeates a lot of the conflict of the film; there's no real key 'villain' here, and like Pixar's previous film, Monsters University, there's no really clear antagonist ala the robot in WALL-E or Jason Lee in the Incredibles.The stakes are all about 'what is this person going to choose to do, to be, to have the growth and change of human experience?' And with kids too, it's a fascinating idea to explore in the depth this does. Many times as children, we're told to not be so sad, to pick up our spirits and be happy, or be happier, to not cry, to not be angry, and some children even get punished if they, say, cry too much or throw temper tantrums - if they're not ""normal"" in the sense of having constant joy. Look at Winnie the Pooh to see the many different takes on outlooks, such as Tigger being boundless energy, Pooh being curiosity, Piglet fear, Rabbit the 'brains', with Eeyore being the one who is constantly sad, and almost made to seem like kind of a punch-line, the ""Nobody's here but me"" deal.If that sounds a little deep to take your four year old too, don't worry: this is one of the company's most entertaining and, often, funny films. It builds exponentially on the segment from Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex, where we saw inside the mind of a man while on a date/during sex. Of course this is a PG kid's movie so it can't go there (It's an 11 year old-girl after all), but the filmmakers give us five 'emotions' with Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust, and Fear, who all control little Riley as she goes about her life. When her family moves to San Francisco, and a mishap occurs in the control room - Joy and Sadness get taken away and, in maybe the one real Pixar trope (Toy Stories and Nemo come to mind), they got to get back to where they need to be.Growing up and experiencing new things is what Inside Out is about, and getting there is the ultimate conflict. And while it appeals to kids who may be going through this (or will), and for adults who can tap into what Riley goes through, it doesn't stop for jokes involving the different places inside the consciousness sphere: sub-consciousness, 'Dream-Land' (the movie studio, with the dream filter over the camera lens for filming), Imagination-Land, and (my personal favorite) Abstract Thought, where beings turn step by step into shapes and colors.This latter one shows off just how endlessly clever Pixar can be, by making doodles and figures one might see in a painting right before us. And even the Emotion characters themselves keep making the studio work wonders: look at how the hair and fibers on these things comes off and has the depth of detail one always look for in the films from these guys. By now the company could be resting on their laurels solely - and there are some more (unnecessary?) sequels to come. But Inside Out poses another challenge for them, to make all of these different 'lands' and environments, the max of the Memory Balls, the ""Train of Thought"", everything that shows everything was given consideration and metric-tons of creative wit.There's many laughs to be had following along with Joy and Sadness as they try to find their way back, and this is balanced out by the very real, painful things that a child goes through, especially at the age of 11. It's difficult to make an authentic movie in live-action, but in animation it just comes off like a miracle of some kind; all of the peril means something, and a seemingly goofy side character, like Bing-Bong the imaginary friend to Riley, is fully realized as anyone else in the film. Watch when Riley's objects in Imagination Island fall away, and Bing-Bong doesn't know what to do with himself, as Sadness comes up and makes him go forward. Joy doesn't realize why this should be - why can't she cheer him up? It may or may not be obvious, which is what makes the storytelling so precise and tender and spot-on.Some clichés are dealt with - have a dream with your underpants on and falling teeth, of course - and I wouldn't want it any other way in this film. Inside Out is rich in everything you want in a movie: comedy, drama, thrills, and, more than once real catharsis. It doesn't kid the kids, or the adults. You need everything inside you to be whole, is what it means to say, and it does it with brio and understanding of the human spirit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Emotional and intriguing even for adults,"I greatly enjoyed this movie and think it was really well made in terms of content and delivery. Sure, you could say that cartoons like this are childish but the movie was fun and the content made me thinking. I like the idea of personifying emotions that is prominent in this film as it made me think about the human psychology and even my personal way of dealing with the different emotions. Nevertheless, some stereotypes were a bit overused and unnecessary for the enjoyment of the film. I think this film is worth watching for anyone but especially for reflective people or anyone else who is trying to understand their emotions, whatever the age.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
It's not a blatant rip-off!,"'INSIDE OUT': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Pixar and Disney's new computer-animated fantasy film, about a young girl that's guided through the struggles of moving, and the frequent absence of her father, by her emotions; which are personified, with individual personalities of their own. The movie was directed by Pete Docter and Ronaldo Del Carmen and it was written by Docter, Carmen, Meg LeFauve and Josh Cooley (Docter has co-written and directed other popular Pixar flicks, like 'UP' and 'MONSERS, INC.'; as well as co- wrote 'WALL-E' and 'TOY STORY' 1 & 2). It features the voice talents of Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith, Richard Kind, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling, Kaitlyn Dias, Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan. The concept for the film has been done many times before (most notably on the 90's TV sitcom 'HERMAN'S HEAD') but it's still a very imaginative and well made kids' film!Riley (Dias) is a young girl, growing up in Minnesota, who has five voices inside her mind; guiding her every decision, and feeling. They're Joy (Poehler), Sadness (Smith), Fear (Hader), Anger (Black) and Disgust (Kaling). Joy is in charge of keeping Riley primarily happy, but she's constantly struggling with how to deal with Sadness. When Riley is forced to move to San Francisco, at age 11, and her father (MacLachlan) is constantly away at work, things become really challenging for Joy. Especially when Joy and Sadness are thrown out of the headquarters, inside Riley's mind, and have to make a journey back to it, in order to restore Riley's mental stability.I grew up on 'HERMAN'S HEAD'; I used to watch it all the time when I was a kid, so when I first saw the trailer for this film, I wasn't very impressed. It seemed like a rip-off and it also just didn't look that good to me. So I had low expectation for the movie, until I heard all the rave reviews for it, from critics and audiences alike. After seeing the film, I can say it's not a blatant rip-off; and it does have plenty of fresh ideas and creativity of it's own. Although the premise isn't original, it does deal with it in a interesting and entertaining way; the whole world, inside Riley's mind (the film creates), is very fascinating. I do wonder though, if we all have people inside our heads, guiding us through life, do they all have people inside their heads too, guiding them, and so on? The humor is kind of childish but it does have a very positive message; about dealing with depression, and life struggles, that I think could be beneficial for every kid to see. It might not be one of the most original Pixar films, but it is one of it's best (in my opinion).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/3LSix0bykDQ",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

An unlikely ride of emotions,"I never take the time to write a review of movies or series, but for this one, I gladly make an exception. What I wrote down below is how I personally felt about Inside Out and how it made me feel.To me, it was the perfect example of a film that slowly but steadily grows on you whilst ensuring character development without becoming too predictable. I especially, as most I am sure, was very annoyed by the presence as well as actions of Sadness in the beginning, yet later on in the film I began to comprehend its importance and right, even essential need to exist for so much more than sorrow, regret and all other less pleasant feelings.In one of the most beautiful ways I have ever seen, this film shows for me the importance of accepting and acknowledging sadness as an important part of who you are and no matter who you are or what you've been through, Inside Out will always touch base with your feelings one way or the other.My profound thanks to the people of Pixar and all those who dedicated their time on this amazing capturing of feelings and guidance in the journey of comprehending their significance.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Should be Rated NC-17,"Pixar has a new target audience -- the pseudo-intellectual movie critic who happens to be a horrible parent with a complete lack of awareness as to why their children behave as they do during times of stress.Yes, quite possibly my worst movie experience ever... And I am not a young opinionated teen, but rather a middle-aged parent with seasoned movie tastes -- or at least I like to think so.Not a single child in the packed theater left happier than when they entered. Very few happy moments throughout a constantly darkening film, with about 45 seconds of ""happy"" resolution at the end. The dialogue is perplexing to children and possibly many adults in the audience. A stunning failure.All in all, probably a poor decision by me as a parent to view (or by Pixar to develop?) a film with so few moments of joy or happiness for children, who I had incorrectly assumed were the target audience. But how was I to know??Do yourself a favor and find a real children's movie for your little ones and not this rubbish.

"Funny, Poignant and Emotionally Fulfilling","I went with high hopes to this film after having watched the magic and beauty of ""Up"" created by the same team. And I wasn't disappointed.The entire concept of an alternate reality within the brain is a stroke of marvelous creativity, and the way the story turned and twisted around unexpected corners made the watch engaging and fulfilling. This is a story that dazzles with its onset, evolves with its progress and leaves a feeling of warmth with its conclusion.Throughout the storytelling there is a sense of innocence that makes the characters all the more likable. The complexities of the human psyche have been boiled down to five principle emotions who begin as simple one-dimensional characters and mature by experiencing loss and achievement in their own individual ways - which is the true essence of growing up.All in all, this is a story well thought out and equally well presented, making this a complete film and easily one of the best from Pixar so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar has done it again,"Let me just throw this out there: Inside Out is easily the best Pixar film in years. Inside Out is not just the best in the last few years, but it will without a doubt stand alongside the best of the best the studio has to offer. It's a really tough thing to rank Pixar, because they have had such stellar track record, and so it really boils down to which animated masterpiece is your favorite. Do you love the nostalgia of the original Toy Story, or how about how Finding Nemo swept us away? We can argue The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E and Up are the best that Pixar has to offer...Inside Out is going to further complicate that favorite status for a lot of people.Inside Out is about a little girl named Riley, and the story takes place during a time when her family makes a great move from her Minnesota home town to San Francisco. For anyone who has ever moved at a young age, they may recall emotional hurdles trying to adjust to living in a new home, new location, a new school and making new friends. It can be a lot to ask for to a child. That is what this movie is about, and Pixar tells this story on parallel planes both from Riley's humanistic world and the very emotions that exist within her head.Riley's brain is bonkers. Never have I expected to see such surrealistic imaginative settings for a Pixar film. Unlike every film the studio has made to date, Inside Out creates a slate that breaks all logical boundaries. We are talking about a world that is as vast as your very own imagination, and Pixar takes full advantage of that by making truly out-there and brilliant possibilities.Inside Out is a movie about emotions, and it would not be a success if the movie itself did not feel emotional. This is probably the most emotional Pixar film to date, but as a roller coaster that goes through its highs and lows, and it makes sure you are along for the ride.At the end of the day, once you see the full picture of Inside Out you will understand the true context and all the metaphors toward life it has to share. This is easily the most complex and layered Pixar film to date, and in a way it sets a new bar for Pixar's maturity at telling captivating stories that anyone can relate to no matter what the age is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great movie with fresh idea,"I should say that this is a really great movie with valuable lessons and fresh plot.Riley's emotions is relatable to all of us. We all ever experience happiness, sadness, fearfulness, anger, and other emotions in our life, and Pixar delivers a great life lessons in this movie that every emotion and moments in our life is important to helps us grow up as a better person and teach us valuable lessons along the way. This is one of those Pixar and Disney movie that you can always watch it all over again and feels something new each time.On the other sides, younger child may not understand the concept, so I will recommend it for children older than 7. But overall this is a really fresh movie and both Pixar and Disney deserve an A+.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
We've Got a Masterpiece on Our Hands!,"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a masterpiece on our hands. Pixar has done it again. They already lay claim to two of the top 100 movies of all-time with Up and Wall-E and they have now added Inside Out to their mantelpiece. I will gladly go on record by calling this one of the finest animated features to ever be created. Why? Because it's THE most innovative, imaginative and creative film to be made since 2008s Synecdoche, New York.The beautiful thing about this movie is that both adults and children can enjoy it. As a matter of fact, I'd say that adults may enjoy it more, because they can have a more fundamental understanding of what this film is. It is 100 minutes of analogous brilliance, that changes our idea of what goes on in our heads. Is this idea fathomable or true? No. But the analogy provides the very product film was invented to produce: a stimulation of the imagination. Children will enjoy the beautiful colors and the basic plot. What the children can understand is what they can relate to: growing up and adjusting to life as they enter puberty. They will laugh at things that SEEM funny or the more, for lack of better word, simple pieces of humor. But the true jokes, the pieces of humor that have the most intellect are the ones children won't understand. I appreciate those the most because they're fathomable. It's the moment when you laugh, not because the joke is ridiculous, but because you can actually imagine that happening.Amidst the hilarity there is also a certain depth of emotion. There is a tear-jerking moment, yes, but I mean more along the lines of nostalgia. The way the movie portrays the effects of the emotions and the rationalization that go along with them, conjure a desire to reflect on oneself in their pre-teen days. This film may literally get into the mind of a pre-teen, but the metaphorical representation is what seals the reflection. ""I was like that?"", ""Is that how I thought then...I that how I think now?"" may be questions you find yourself asking yourself. These are the effects of a brilliant screenplay.On a final and personal note, I'll tell this short story. There is a scene in the film, where two officers are questioning a cloud in Imagination Land about her dead husband. Then, in the middle of the interrogation the cloud herself is killed as she is run through by our main character. One cop goes, ""Hey wait..."", but as he says that, the other cop grabs him and says, ""Forget it Jake, it's Cloud Town."" Get it? It's a parody of the famous final words from the classic 1974 noir, Chinatown. I'll tell you, it wasn't very comfortable being the only person in the theater laughing at that joke. It's just one joke amongst many. Beyond the hilarity and, mainly due to the aforementioned reasons I explained, I happily give this instant classic 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend it for ages 7 to 18.This film will be released on DVD/Blu-ray/Digital on November 3 and its bonus features are very informative and engaging. They give wonderful insights to the making of the movie. The feature, Story of the Story really tells you how much thinking went into this story. Mixed Emotions and Mapping the Mind go hand in hand as they provide both characterizations of the emotions and scientific findings pertaining to our emotions. There are also great features about the underrated parts of making this movie, like how the score was created and what the editing was like. My favorite of all of them, is the short film Lava which has become one of my favorite short films.Reviewed by Willie J., KIDS FIRST!

I don't get it,"why so many people have to rate this movie being a bad one. I loved it, my wife loved it and that result is very rare. The movie doesn't claim to explain the whole world in detail, but it is the first movie in a long time which is made for children that tries it in an interesting way and for me succeeds in a lot of aspects. Finally not a stupid cartoon like, kids are crazy, just be crazy, oh so crazy movie for children and adults.

Truly Comes From the Heart,"Owing from Pixar Studios' absence last year - and it's recent over-reliance on prequels and sequels - their latest project titled Inside Out happens to be the most hilarious and emotionally-driven movie ever shown. Not since their last films Up and Toy Story 3 has there ever been a Pixar movie that will make you laugh and even move you by the time it has reached its climactic end.As the story goes, 11-year-old Riley Anderson and her family live a great life in their Minnesota town. But when her father is transferred to a new job in the Bay Area of San Francisco and has the entire family uprooted, Riley has trouble fitting in to this different environment, causing her emotions within to navigate her through a new neighborhood, new school, and new life.When it was near over, I began to take notice there were a few various fellow audience members (fewer kids and mostly adults) quietly tearing up, while it also left the gears in my mind constantly turning and pondering out of curiosity over how much the studio went through to get this concept right. To me, I feel Pixar seems to have finally rebounded from their quality blunders in the early 2010s and focused more on an entirely new, original story that has an equal balance of comedy and drama rather than just one particular genre, which doesn't usually turn out that well when trying to tell it in animated form. With a talented cast voicing the personified emotions like Amy Poehler and Bill Hader (SNL alums), Mindy Kaling, Lewis Black, and Phyllis Smith, it's like they really channeled these vibrant, colorful characters with such ease and likability. Newcomer Kaitlyn Dias wasn't bad neither voicing their human host Riley since the character's personality - from my own personal experience - started to remind me of a young niece I know. Director Pete Docter sure cranked out yet another cleverly crafted, amazing story following from his past, touching hits Monsters Inc. and Up. And he certainly meant well when he said that his movies were practically based on his family life, in this case his own preteen daughter Ellie - whom Riley is loosely modeled after.The film's concept feels near-similar to past works like 2001's Osmosis Jones (its concept was well-conceived, but how it contrasts into the real world setting didn't translate well) and the 1943 Disney short titled ""Reason and Emotion."" However the studio managed to push this concept further with an imaginative set-up where the emotions are not just the characters, but by exploring that the mind has endless possibilities and realms for them to wander outside their headquarters, depending on how well Riley's experiences (good or bad) are in the real world. It's like it frequently plays with Isaac Newton's third law of motion. One example of that had Sadness affecting one core memory by touch and it affects Riley not just physically, but mentally as well. Psychologically for an adult, we would easily get the idea if the problem isn't resolved, apathy will further escalate. Not many kids will understand why we feel moved by it, since through their perspective, they'll mostly adore the entire film as a visual and spectacle delight. With that aside, this movie never once disappointed me since it has both ambition and Pixar nostalgia written all over it. I'm also glad that since the emotions' human host is female, the writing crew did not rely on giving Riley stereotypical ""girly"" interests. Giving her a tomboy-like trait properly balances out how she can run on both sides.The moral: No matter your age or the life you live, the importance of family and your own well-being shouldn't be overlooked. Your mind says one thing, but from the heart there's something more.On a separate note: Its accompanying short subject titled Lava is definitely worth looking into. One of the best Pixar shorts I've ever witnessed in a while. Not sure why awards season overlooks their short films these days, Lava has quite a story that I consider a love letter to Hawaii.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I felt like I was dying inside,"Well, I did it. I finally watched Inside Out, Pixar's latest masterpiece. After months of waiting for it to be released, and listening to peers rave about how it's Pixar's best film yet, that everybody should see it, and that I will love it, I rented it on iTunes and gave it a watch, despite my reservations.Now, here's something about me that some people might be able to relate to, and some might not. I can always tell whether or not I will like a movie, or TV show, or book, either based on what I hear about it, or even if it's little more than a gut feeling. It's almost like a sixth sense, which I've only recently come to understand. There's an alarm that goes off in my head that warns me, ""You are not going to like this."" When it goes off like an air raid siren, I know to stay away.Like I said, I've only recently come to fully understand this, and there have been many times over the years when I've gone ahead anyway despite my misgivings, and ended up wishing I'd trusted said misgivings. I have never been wrong. When I first saw the promotional posters, and learned the plot outline, the inner alarms were blaring loudly and angrily. My instincts have never failed me before.But, as they say, there is a first time for everything.And when that time comes, I will be sure to make it known, because that time still has yet to come.If I had a dime for every time I heard that this movie is Pixar's ""return to form,"" I would probably be set for life. To that assertion, I have a question. Exactly what *form* would that be? The Pixar *I* grew up with made movies that made me *laugh*, that were exciting, and made me feel warm and fuzzy on the inside. This movie, on the other hand, made me laugh in earnest a grand total of once (""Eat me, I'm organic!""), and kind of chuckle one other time (*snore* ""Who's the birthday girl?""). That's it. The entire rest of the movie, I was wanting desperately to go home, even though I was in my room the whole time.No Pixar movie has ever made me feel so miserably unhappy, and the 30-second-long happy ending did nothing to make up for the preceding hour and a half of oppressive, and progressively intensifying, gloom. My goodness, that was depressing. I'm not P.O.'d that it made me cry; I actually never cried, although I did come pretty close at the very end, but even if I had, it wasn't in a good way. I have no idea how this movie was supposed to make me feel, but I felt downcast whether that was the intent or not.If this is Pixar's ""return to form,"" then I'm not sure I want on this ship anymore. This ""form"" started seven years ago with Wall-E, a dreadfully depressing film, continued with Up, about which I listened to my instincts and mercifully skipped (a decision I have never once regretted), and Toy Story 3, which I saw one time and have never watched it since (three guesses why, and the first two don't count). And now Inside Out. Wall-E was a mercy compared to this, and it has barely had time to fully sink in.I just... I'm dejected. I didn't like it at all. As I said before, I had a very bad feeling from the moment I found out what the movie was about. I put off watching it for almost a week after renting it, just to steel myself for it, even after waiting months for it to come out, and now... I'm not sure anything could have prepared me for this. Frankly, I wish I'd left well enough alone, ignored everybody's raving and pressuring me to see it, and never watched it. I guess one positive is that now nobody can tell me 'don't knock it if you haven't tried it.' I tried it, and it made me miserable. I told you so.I apologize to any readers if I'm coming off as ranting and railing, but... that was upsetting. I think I'm going to listen to some John Williams to try to cheer myself up.P.S. Just so nobody misunderstands me, from a purely objective standpoint, this was a marvelously well done film. The animation is beautiful, the voice-acting top notch, and the musical score is lovely. I am not calling any of that into question. This is merely how I experienced the story, and it made me feel like I was dying inside.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Just what goes in inside our heads.,"INSIDE OUT: Why can't we remember events that occurred when we were four? Where do our forgotten childhood memories and imaginary friends go? (On the other hand, if you still talk to or play with yours, you may have some serious issues which may require professional intervention.) Where are our cherished memories stored? What goes on inside our heads, dogs' heads, cats' heads/adolescent boys' heads? (hysterical). How do our thought processes evolve and how does our concept of the world around us change as we mature? All these questions and more are answered in this incredibly entertaining animated film from Disney and Pixar who have given us an actual original idea which is brilliantly conceived, directed and executed.

(After all, It's Disney.) It features the amazing voice talents of Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Mindy Kaling, Diane Lane and Kyle McLachlan, all of whom are unrecognizable. Lewis Black, as Anger (of course) gives actors a master class in: It's not what you say. It's how you say it. Kids will love it, but won't appreciate the significance of the message. This is really an animated film for grownups. Score: 10. GO!! Don't miss it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Inside Out Review,"Inside Out(2015) Starring: Amy Poehler, Mindy Kaling, Bill Hader, Phyllis Smith, Lewis Black, Kaitlyn Dias, Paris Van Dyke, Kyle MacLachlan, Lori Allen, Richard Kind, Diane Lane, Paula Pell, Bobby Moynihan, Paula Poundstone, John Ratzenberger, and Rashida Jones Directed By: Pete Docter Review Meet the little voices inside your head. I have never been a big fan of animated features because their just cartoons and if I want that I'll watch the ones that air on television that I like. But their is this amazing company called Pixar(maybe you've heard of them). They've given me some of my favorite films not just as a child but as I've gotten older. I'm talking Monsters University and of course Toy Story 3. I cried like a baby in Toy Story 3. I haven't cried so hard in a film since, until now when I saw Pixar's latest film Inside Out. The film is about a child named Riley and the little voices inside her head. First comes Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear and last but not least Anger. Their Riley's emotions, Joy tries to make sure Riley is happy everyday but Sadness keeps getting in the way. When Riley moves Joy tries to start things out positively in Riley's new home but when Sadness touches another Core memory Joy tries to change it back and they both vanish into long term memory. While they have disappeared Fear, Disgust, and Anger try to make Riley happy on her first day of school and until but they weren't made for those types of feelings. Joy and Sadness have to find a way back to headquarters before Riley runs away from home, her personality destroyed and she can no longer feel anything. I loved the performances from the cast, even the one's who were playing Riley, and her parents. You already know when going into this film that the main stars playing the emotions are going to do an amazing job. Their well known stars in a Pixar movie with a good script. The script isn't very formulaic because it plays with the idea of how we use our emotions. It has a worthwhile point of always doing your best to no mater how feel, you can channel both your sadness with happiness, anger with fear, disgust with happiness or in any way. To makes sure that no matter how we feel we can always be happy no mater what situation, because theirs always way to turn something terrible into something good. While watching the film I was crying because I thought about how I use my emotions in the wrong way when it comes to a girl I like or a girl I like that moves, or not fitting with the people I call my friends at church(because I have nothing in common with them because I love films like it's no one's business, play XBOX One, and I'm going to Fl Supercon, and well I still have acne after trying to get rid of it for five years. This is a film that really touched and can regard as one of the best animated films of all time I'm giving Inside Out a five out of five.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
love love love this movie!!!,"Brilliant concept built with boundless imagination and amazing creativity! To me, this beautiful & heart-warming movie is indeed the best of Pixar since Wall-E, and one of the best movies so far in 2015.I ❤️ the film so much that it even drove me to tears for the last 20 minutes of the movie. Those were ""happy"" tears, as the movie's message: sadness is not a bad thing, 'cause it can be the doorway to profound understanding, help us see what really matters in life and appreciate happiness more.Don't miss it, even if you are or you are not a Disney and Pixar's fan. You'll love it simply because you're someone's Dad, someone's Mom or someone's child.It is such a silly truth that I've cried for animated films a lot more than romance.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Depressing,"I was expecting a funny lighthearted animated movie, one I have come to expect from Pixar. Unfortunately there was only one funny scene, but it was the scene I already watched in the trailer. Instead I had to endure over an hour of the most depressing movie I have ever brought my daughter to see. It seems as though Pixar tried desperately to make a movie with an adult theme (ie the psychological workings of emotions in the mind, with a plot that is, unfortunately, commonplace in real life ) but with goofy animation that appeals to children.. I wish they stuck to the adult humor that goes over the kid's heads rather than serious issues that goes over the kid's heads.. Sadly in the end, the ""happy"" ending was only mildly happy. Not nearly happy enough to raise me up out of the depression the movie had sank me into.. I left the cinema down, and that's not what I like to spend money on. I asked my daughter, ""so what would you give it out of 10?"" She said ""an 8"" but when she got into the car she seemed sad, I asked her was she OK? and she started to cry and retold me a part of the movie she found sad.. Unfortunately that didn't go over her head.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I related with Inside Out as if it was my childhood story,"Inside Out is an adorable animated movie about a girl who moves away from her friends, school and relocated to a city where she knew no one. In her brain her memories were stored by little cute emotions. As she started to make memories the balls of light went into different categories. Sadness came upon her and memories were lost. Happiness tried to keep the memories alive but slowly they were disappearing. My favorite part of Inside Out was when her imaginary friend started to fade away, it was such a touching part of the animated film that I cried. As a family of women my mom, me and my 2 nieces we watched the movie together and we have great memories of our own to store and share about the day we spent together and watching Inside Out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.,"Disney & Pixar have made some worthy films that have become well known to audiences of all ages, but the last few releases haven't reached to the quality and standards they had established (in which the last great film they had made is both Up and Toy Story 3). With their latest offering, it is safe and proud to say that Inside Out establishes them back in the game of quality storytelling, animation and heart its concept.Inside Out explores the mind of a young girl, in her mind we are introduced to the emotions of Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear. They have the roles of controlling emotions that they see through Riley's point of view via headquarters, deciding how she reacts to them (for instance; if Riley was to be happy, Joy would have the controls to do so) and as well they collect 'core memories' that store into the long term memory of Riley in which we are throughout the film shown with moments of happiness, love and set her personality. However, when Riley's family makes a big move to the city it changes the roles of the emotions in Riley in which set off an adventure when Joy and Sadness (an emotion that is often pushed aside) are outWhat makes this film so well perfect is the mixture of imagination, heart and literally emotion; a concept like this may seem at first impossible to create for the screen but Pixar have come from out and beyond to create an original piece of work that is both open, inspiring and really makes us look in a new way of how our emotions and personal life experiences happen. The animation and use of the right colours for the characters is great and when I mean colour, the emotions themselves have specific colours that represent them as how we understand them. For instance; Joy is yellow, Sadness is blue, Disgust is greens, Fear is purple and Anger of course is red. Each of them has individual personalities that help to establish their roles; Joy is happy, bright and positive that makes Riley seem loved by those around herThe emotion that the film carries throughout is further than what Up had already shown us (the well-known and acclaimed 'Married Life' sequence is beyond to what animated films can do to the heart strings), the film makes us personally understand not only the characters on screen but to personally relate to our own life events and personal experiences. The filmmakers have carefully observed on how emotions drive us, in particular Sadness plays a major role in the story that makes us wonder why we can't be sad throughout life but why it's important to be sad when the time comes. In particular, a key moment towards the end of the film pretty much got me and the whole audience (families, couples and even elderly people) in tears and yet understand in our own personal lives the times we get sad. This is a major point that I deeply thought was brought up perfectly and though the much younger kids may not have got it's point but I think from time to time as they grow up they will get the heart of it.Emotion aside, there are lighter moments when humour is present and gets the audience to laugh out loud. The character Bing Bong (an imaginative figure of Riley's earlier years) gives this best when he pops up in the plot, but as well Anger, Fear and the emotions in other human characters provide such humour and even discovering moments in our minds. The humour works very well in the film and it helps to keep the audience on a brighter side.Inside Out is not only a triumphant return to quality storytelling for the filmmakers, but it's both original and engaging for audiences to relate to. Bringing a new way to understand human life and our mind capabilities, the film is perfect for children, adults or even anyone young at heart. This is the best animated film for 2015 and it has a very strong chance in becoming Best Picture in the 2016 Oscars.5/5 - NickHIGHLY RECOMMENDEDP.S. The animated short 'Lava' that screens before the feature is amazing and different to the comedic shorts from previous years, having more heart and soul and a positive message about love and happiness told through song and colourful animation in detail.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Inside Out was another excellent Disney/Pixar animated feature,"Before this feature and the short that preceded it-Lava-director Pete Doctor appeared and explained how his movie-like many others-can take you to new places and inspire various emotions. He was certainly right about that! This film-which centered on the emotions of a girl who feels alienated moving to a new place after years of being comfortable in the old one-can be funny and sad in all the right places. Especially when it focuses on the characters of Joy and Sadness and also an imaginary friend, this movie hits all the right buttons. Very young children may not completely understand all that's depicted but they should still be pretty entertained by many of the images and characterizations depicted here in computer animated form. I really don't want to reveal much so on that note, I highly recommend Inside Out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Inside Out,"The film takes us on a journey inside the mind, through which we discover images of the success and failure of human experiences as well. These voices are embodied in front of us as part of a comedic and dramatic adventure. The film deals with the inner emotional turmoil experienced by the eleven-year-old child Riley; Where her life is turned upside down because her family is forced to move to another city, and then move away from her friends and all the things she loves from places, things, activities and memories. These feelings are embodied in the interaction between five main characters who live inside Riley's mind and lead her daily life: ""joy"", ""sadness"", ""anger"", ""fear"" and ""disgust."" The movie is one of the best Pixar films",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
To Heavy for Children,"I have 5 year old twins who saw the movie yesterday. My daughter left the movie crying and cried several times during the film, it was much to heavy and sad for young kids.What ever happened to happy kids movies that made us laugh and smile?Dealing with depression in Big Hero 6 and now this, my kids don't need to learn about or try to understand these heavy subject lines.I am also a big Pixar fan and as an adult there was no real storey line and none of the usual adult humour thrown in to keep it interesting for everyone. Although this was disappointing it was outweighed by the depressing overall feeling to the entire movie and the fact that I was either explaining to my kids what was happening or consoling them from crying.I can't wait to see Minions at least we should get some smiles out of that. I'm tired of leaving the movie theatre feeling worse than when we went in.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A very good movie understanding a teenagers life and feelings,"I was excited once i was going to watch this, seeing the trailers and thinking it was just a funny animated movie. Once i watched it, it made me think. About how we can be so eaten up by our feelings and emotions that we forget our family and loved ones, how much they wan't to be there for us and help us in any time of life. Sometimes we just wan't to get away, but that's not always the best choice. I really loved watching this film, it's a good learner and reminder of how a teenagers life can be and is. Bullying, embarrassment, breakdowns and not always getting what you wish for but still having a hint about what you currently got. I recommend this movie for pretty much anyone, especially for people that got kids and are in the same situation and need a reminder what really matters in life even tho it might not be the best time for you and your family right now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Smart, heart-warming and super funny.","I saw this movie and I was impressed! Back by popular demand, it's ""Matthew Praises!"" It is not just the run of the mill family movie with CGI and celebrity talents, this one is psychologically well-researched! It is a mixture between Dinsey's World War 2 propaganda short ""Reason and Emotion"" mixed with Roger Hargreaves' ""Mr. Men"". The reason why I said that is because all the emotions are controlling the girl's head just like in that cartoon. Second, I said the latter part of the comparison because like Roger Hargreaves, the were thinking, ""What would a personification of an emotion would look like?"" What would a memory bank be depicted and how would the subconscious or dreams look like? The skin of the emotions look like felt, kind of like The Muppets, except they sparkle like some sort of fire. The film gave out a good side-effect which was controlling your emotions. A father took his kid to see the movie and after watching it, he took his son to the pool and he climbed up highest diving board and dived into the pool and his father asked why he did that out of curiosity and he said that fear was driving the bus. Before the feature, there was an introduction by Pete Docter, the film's director, talking about the joy of going to the movies and the short, ""Lava"" about two volcanoes in love. Bottom line: You will laugh, you will cry and you will understand why! So come on and give it a watch it is fun for the whole family. There is no shocking moments like the ones seen on Cartoon Network today. I am positive that you will enjoy it. Bottom line: A must-watch. Rated PG for thematic elements (like references to profanity) and some action (more like some peril, but seriously MPAA raters you are just over-reacting, it should be rated G). This has been another ""Matthew Praises.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Another great Pixar classic,"I'm a moviegoer who loves seeing original ideas and original screenplay when watching films. For the past couple years it seems that Hollywood has lost much of its originality and is recycling the same tired movies, or morphing repeated novels into film. This is where Disney Pixar has gone above and beyond the rest. They continue to capture audiences around the world with every film they produce. The originality that lies within the studio goes unmatched by almost all. Pete Docter (director) has a wonderful imagination and an even better talent at transforming his imagination to the big screen.About the movie: Cast: The characters are both memorable and easy to relate to. These emotions stir up in every one of us and it is very funny to look at human emotions through the eyes of Docter. The voices are a perfect match for each emotion as well. No one went too over the top and no one lagged behind the rest. Each character blended well into the film and made their mark in their own individual way. Even the films main characters, Riley and her family, were very easy to relate too. Growing up is hard and emotions (especially in young girls) can fly around like crazy. I feel that this is an aspect of the film many people can relate to, the hardships of growing up.Plot: I will do my best to not give the movie away. It is an interesting story that I am still digesting as I write this review. I saw a pre-screening last night and have been thinking about the movie ever since. All of Riley's core emotions (joy, sadness, disgust, anger, and fear) all live in pretty much the control center of Riley's brain. They each help Riley form memories that shape her view on life and help her discover who she is as a person. For a reason I won't share with you, joy and sadness get separated from the control center and end up in Riley's long term memory space. They get separated at a really crucial point in Riley's life, her family moves from Minnesota to California which is a really hard move for Riley, without Joy (her once main emotion) controlling things Riley turns into a completely different person. Although Joy and Sadness are not present in the control center they can most certainly tell something is not right with their girl. The adventure to get back to help Riley is full of the two emotions that got lost in the first place, joy and sadness.It is interesting that Pixar has these two emotions working together. I say this because I feel that these emotions are the secret of the studios success with all of their films. These are the two strongest emotions inside all of us, joy and sadness, and in each of their films they have an equal blend of both of these emotions that really capture the heart of the audience. As I think back to almost all the Pixar films I've seen they both had extremely sad parts that would most certainly bring tears to your eyes (Up, Toy Story films, Wall-E, Brave, etc) and equally funny, heartwarming parts that make us fall in love with the films. All I can say is, thank you Pixar for staying original and yet again capturing the hearts of all of those who dare to dream and still have a little imagination left inside of us.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
