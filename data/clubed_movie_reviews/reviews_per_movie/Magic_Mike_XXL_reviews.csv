Liked it,"I'll be honest: as a female I just wanted to see beautiful male bodies dancing- that's what I came for, not the plot, not the story line, not even the acting really. Loved seeing Channing work his amazing body!!! A very talented, watchable dancer. Loved the convenience store routine with Joe. Loved the finale scene with Channing and tWitch. There were some good moments and some funny moments here and there. Could it have been better, sure. And by that I mean more dance time- with less clothes on- for Channing, Joe and and Matt. This is why I liked the first one better- at least their pants came off more often! The fact that both movies did well at the box office speaks to the market for more (even better done) movies that showcase male entertainers for the viewing pleasure of women (and men) who appreciate it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Look under the surface,"So on the surface this is about some dudes dancing with not much else. However, if you look under the surface and get into the message it's trying to convey you will see that these guys are worshipping women. We are queens, we are beautiful no matter our size. The men worship the women and it's lovely to see. It isn't all sleaze and sex. It's about laughing, comradeship and boosting women. Can't be all bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
early fun,"Mike (Channing Tatum) is working his dream of making furniture but he's barely scrapping by. Dallas has left the Kings of Tampa behind and the guys are looking for one last blow-out. Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan (Kevin Nash), Ken (Matt Bomer), Tito (Adam Rodriguez), and MC Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias) are going on a road trip to a convention in Myrtle Beach run by Paris (Elizabeth Banks). When Tobias gets hurt in a crash, Mike recruits Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith) who brings along Andre (Donald Glover). Mike falls for Zoe (Amber Heard) but the guys are joined by her mother Nancy Davidson (Andie MacDowell) and her friends.I like the first thirty minutes or so. It kept some of the Soderbergh style. I like Manganiello who is very charming and a little funny. I love him in the convenient store. It's the most innocent fun and I wish the movie stays with that feel. The movie should stay with the six guys having misadventures on the road on their way to the big gig. Then it tries to replace Matthew McConaughey with Jada Pinkett Smith. Matthew stole the first movie. Jada seems to be trying to repeat the feat but it's not the same. Then it tries to inject Glover in with the group which only jumbles up the chemistry once again. The Andie MacDowell section is interesting and it would be great as a companion scene to other more humorous scenes. The last thirty minutes is a long series of stripper performances. I'm sure it's orgasmic for middle aged girlfriends drinking their wines but it gets pretty boring for me. I like the first act but the movie loses a little bit of chemistry when it sets aside Iglesias.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
3 + 10 / 2,"90% of this movie begs the question - Why?Why is the dialogue so drawn out, yet adds nothing to the plot? Why is one boring scene entirely unlit? Why can't Amber Heard make eye contact? Why is Michael Strahan here for 5 minutes? Why barely use Twitch in a movie about dancing? Why are they littering while driving?I give that 90% of the film 3 stars.BUT I give Joe Manganiello's dance scenes 10 stars. His performance to ""I Think I Wanna Marry You"" will be a special memory for the rest of my life. Thank you, Joe.My suggestion to the viewer is to fast forward directly to the last 30 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
XXL Times Better Than Magic Mike,"Brimming with a refreshing energy and setting the stage on fire with its erotically charged aura, Magic Mike XXL is a definite improvement over its predecessor that fully embraces its strengths, is well aware of its limitations, and discards almost everything that it can do without to deliver a romp ride that's light, simple & pure delight from beginning to end.Set 3 years after the events of the first film, Magic Mike XXL finds Mike running his own furniture business like he always wanted but a part of him still misses that old profession. Things are set in motion when he receives a call from his former mates and learns that they've been abandoned by Dallas and plan to bow out with one last performance and decides to join them in their endeavour.Directed by Gregory Jacobs, Magic Mike XXL trims out everything that stopped the previous film from stretching its arms & legs, and travels a better aligned route. Also, unlike the original, all the subplots head in the same direction as its central storyline, characters get more room to breathe, and there's a sense of history & togetherness in the group's bonding that's genuinely felt in their interactions.The plot takes the structure of a road trip movie that covers the themes of life, love & friendship as it moves ahead and the music & dance numbers are in perfect harmony with each other and is one key element that makes it blissful on so many levels. Images are more sleek, dance choreography undergoes a major upgrade and it simply packs the right amount of energy & erotica that makes a stripping performance great.Coming to the performances, the absence of Matthew McConaughey doesn't hurt the film much as his absence is rarely felt. Channing Tatum makes excellent use of the leading spot and contributes with a physically exhausting yet downright seductive performance in his reprising role. Manganiello gets more screen time than before and does well with what he's given while the newcomers are no slouch and ably play their part.On an overall scale, Magic Mike XXL has XXL times the magic & charisma of its predecessor and is a worthy follow-up by all means. Its simple storytelling & lighthearted flair may not impress those looking for a deeper inspection of the male stripping profession but its testosterone-fuelled atmosphere, lustful moves, beefy allure & surprising evolution into an unabashed celebration of female desire turns it into one of the most enjoyable & entertaining delights of its year.",,Anonymous,Music
A little more entertaining than the original,"As the usual trend goes, most sequels perform just as well or better financially than their predecessor. However, that doesn't mean they receive better reviews than the original, which leads to the inevitable downfall of a tent pole franchise. Sometimes though, production crews and the people behind it can be more careful how they prepare the next chapter in the story. Has it always proven to be successful? Most likely not because there is also a fine line between taking the time to prepare a story of equal or better quality and taking too much time. For the Magic Mike (2012) series, it seems like the film crew wanted to make this one different from the past entry. Despite the cast mostly remaining the same, the production was able to keep things feeling new.The sequel starts with Mike (Channing Tatum) returning to his original dance crew after he received news that Dallas (Matthew McConaughey) and original trainee Adam (Alex Pettyfer) went off to perform in China. On top of that Brooke (Cody Horn) has left Mike as his lifestyle was not for her after all. So with that all said, Mike joins Rich (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan (Kevin Nash), Ken (Matt Bomer), Tito (Adam Rodriguez) and Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias) on a ride to basically find their next place to perform. The script was once again written by Reid Carolin as like the last film. This time, instead of being focused more on Mike and Adam and his intimate relationships, the attention is now on Mike and the bromance he has with his buddies. In a way, it became more of a road trip film than strictly just an adult entertainer and dance film.Directing the feature this time was Gregory Jacobs, who has served as a first assistant to most films. One of his earlier film credits was a second assistant to Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991). The execution to the narrative is on point with its predecessor. Since things didn't turn out as planned where the original movie had ended, it was time for Mike to get back to basics. This allows for more development between the character and other supporting characters that only got a little exposure in the prior entry. Now, this allows Rich, Tarzan, Ken and Tito to shine more in their own way. This also allows for more comedic moments to come through for the guys too. For example, Rich (Joe Manganiello) feels like he's getting to old and is concerned his days are numbered in his career.Mike has the same concern but is again, looking for a romantic interest. The part of the screenplay that doesn't add up are some character connections. Like why is Tobias still hanging with the guys if his connections were the cause of some of the plot turmoil from the prior film? There's also some minor characters that show up played by Jada Pinkett Smith and Elizabeth Banks who don't really add much to the plot. There's even appearances from Amber Heard, Andie MacDowell and Donald Glover. The interactions most of these characters have between each other feel genuine and the comedic elements definitely help solidify that. Again though, the series is still not directed towards a straight male audience so in general, it still may not be appealing to all of the masses.Visually speaking the sequel is just as strong in that department. Returning to shoot for this entry is Steven Soderbergh as the director of cinematography. Despite a lot of the scenes now being on the road, the shots are well lit and work within the narrative's structure. The dance choreography was again top tier considering the type of movie genre that it is. For the ears, music was also kept consistent although not preferred. Again there was no film score as the soundtrack was the source that dictated what the audience would hear in specific scenes. It's not bad or inappropriate for the type of movie that it is but a competent film score certainly helps give a movie more dramatic impact when needed.The sequel is surprisingly a little more entertaining to watch even if the premise is not so much. There is still only a soundtrack to hear and some characters seem sort of unnecessary to keep. However, the acting is still solid, comedy is a bit stronger among the main cast and the dancing is obviously just notable as it was before.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
XXL is XX Lame,"I totally loved the first Magic Mike and the first 5 minutes of XXL looked good too. But after those first 5 minutes....XXL suddenly turned into one long improv show - The sort of improv done by people with fabulous bodies and no sense of humor whatsoever - The sort of improv where audience members shout out topics like ""Frozen Yogurt"" or ""A boring person sits next to you on a bus and just won't shut up."" After a while I felt sorry for the actors who seemed to try so hard to come up with something, anything, to say, while growing more and more resentful as in ""Hey - we're strippers, not writers. Do we have to do everything?""And the dancing this time? Yuck. I even felt sorry for the female audience members in the dance sequences. Imagine that you are just out for a fun bachelorette party, when you suddenly find yourself thrust 6 feet in the air with your ""bachelorette parts"" strapped across some strange guy's face and then the guy starts doing somersaults and cartwheels. Ouch.I left about 3/4ths of the way through. It was just all too sad.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Not as bad as expected,"If you are going to the theater for this movie you have to be aware that you are going to definitely watch a male stripper film.From my point of view, ""Magic Mike XXL"" is more superficial than the first ""Magic Mike"". It focuses too much to male dancing losing part of the deepness that made the first movie a good one to watch.Although I missed Matthew McConaughey, Channing Tatum is really good at this film with great striptease performances. I would say he is better than in the first one. I have also liked the acting of Amber Heard, though his role is not fully developed in the movie. We can also easily see the chemistry among the guys. On the other hand, the songs and the staging are quite powerful.To sum up, you will probably spend a good time watching this film, but in few hours you will forget it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Sequels have been good until now,"UGH...just saw MM XXL and I left the theater feeling grubby. Look, I'm no prude and I really liked the first Magic Mike and was hoping to see the same kind of guilty pleasure with some good moves. Forget it. These guys just used their nice bodies in a showy, uninteresting way and there was very little classy hot dancing.It's such a rip off when actors just walk through a movie because it's going to make money. Wait for the DVD if you want to see this. It's corny, sleazy, very little dancing by the guys and a stupid, stupid story line. This movie had no class at all as the first Magic Mike had...that one was good!Sheesh, I almost walked out about 25 min. into the movie, but then I thought I could not give a solid review if I did. What a waste of my time. I should have gone to Terminator.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Sexy sexy sexy!!,"There is obviously not much of a storyline here, but who the hell cares? These men are absolutely sexy and watching them strip and dance is all anyone really wants to see. I loved the special appearance from Donald Glover and Jada. I was a bit weary as to how this would turn out after McConaughey left, but it really didn't matter!Also to whoever said that these male strippers are ""too old"". Well yeah, technically they are all in their late 30s and beyond, but again, who cares? If they look like that at any age, it doesn't matter. Channing Tatum is just amazing, his dance moves and body are pretty much jaw-dropping. The others are great as well. There's really no denying it.This is a perfect girls night out movie! Don't miss the hotness.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Where's the beef?,"Strange it is to pay seven to ten dollars to see a movie about male strippers--and none of them even remove their tee shirts until a so- called ""grand finale"" at the end. This is when our boys actually strip down to speedos and jock straps. Wow. Channing Tatum, the main star, was all over the media months before the premiere, assuring one and all that this sequel to the highly successful original, ""Magic Mike,"" definitely deserves a ""hard X"" since it'll show off a lot more of the guys than previously seen. As he winked and smirked, he also promised us he would keep the most handsome of the original strippers, Joe Manganiello, naked as much as possible. Tatum's promises never appeared. Instead, we have nearly two hours of non-stop verbal garbage as the guys ad-lib and we can't understand anything they say since they all swallow their words. In their van they're traveling to Myrtle Beach for a stripper convention and along they way, they have several encounters with women who are so unattractive they're only blurs. Then we come to big stripper event. We're tantalized by seeing other male strippers preparing for the show but we never see them. All we see is a hysterical carnival like routine featuring Tatum, Joe and Matt Bonner. They whirl around, move their hips against women and when they finish, we realize none of our hotties even showed their butts, let alone their joy sticks. Probably the most hideous sequence in the movie that drags on forever is when the guys stop at a plantation to see black strippers but it's all filmed so darkly you can't tell what's happening in the shadows. Poor Jada Pickett Smith. She should definitely grab the Raspberry Award for the Most Horrendous cameo in the movie. This is a movie that could safely play on the Disney Channel but even the kids would be bored out of their skulls.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
So much fun!,"Is this Shakespeare? No. Is this some boring Oscar winning movie? No. It's just a hot, sexy, hilarious blast.

More like Half Magic Mike,I'm not sure how to review this film. The first one was a surprisingly well rounded film about male strippers which was fun but had an undertone of sadness running through it. It wasn't really a film that needed a sequel. But here we are with Magic Mike XXL. those looking for a film to continue the development of the title character's story line will be disappointed as will those looking for the original fun streaks to be supersized. Here we have a film with characters who are somewhat interesting and definitely charismatic but the storytelling lacks any real depth in getting to now who they are. Now I guess that would be fine if it delivered on the other goods. But it doesn't although the dancing is impressive the film lacks the playful sexuality that made the first one so appealing. Instead it plays as an inconsistent underdeveloped comedy of sorts. It's no doubt that the film has charm and the cast is game for some improv work but most of the ramblings feel pointless and the overall execution almost feels dreamlike and directionless. I'd be lying if I didn't say the film had some fun to offer but it's too weighed down by trying to boost up it's own self esteem to find the movie it should have been. **.75/5,6.0,Anonymous,Music
A grubby little movie with very little dancing,"I love Channing Tatum and I'd go and watch anything with him in it. I also liked the first Magic Mike movie for what it was - very lightweight entertainment, some hot male bodies, a bit of humour, a bit of a plot line and some great dancing.This sequel is just grubby, and, well boring. The dancing is minimal. Most of the 'performances' at the end aren't dancing at all. The Andy McDowell house scenes went on and on ... and on, with absolutely no plot purpose and no dancing, so what was the point? And the scenes with the women 'clients' at the Jade Pickett Smith establishment are pretty demeaning to the women. The bumping and grinding on fat women in the movie is clearly meant to show what great 'performers' these strippers are, able to fake it with any desperate female. I'm absolutely no prude, but it all became pretty sickening in the end, and I was just BORED with the whole thing really. Channing, it's time to move on, mate.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A very entertaining movie for girls and guys!,"Never in a million years would I imagine to end up enjoying a movie about male strippers. Both, the first ""Magic Mike"" and ""Magic Mike XXL"" proved me wrong. I loved watching this movie! Like the first one this film is not simply showing a bunch of naked dudes dancing on the screen, it is more of an adventure film.""Magic Mike XXL"" has a very simple, yet very entertaining plot. Even though the movie was over two hours long, it didn't feel too stretched out to me. I kept wanting to watch more and see what this group of guys are going to do next. The tone of the film is perfect. It is not taking itself too seriously, yet I would not call this movie a pure comedy. There are, although, a bunch of moments in the film that made me laugh out loud really hard. Channing is great, but Joe Manganiello was the best for me; he is absolutely hysterical. I am not a fan of male striptease, but for some reason I really enjoyed the actual performance scenes too. The performances are not what you would typically imagine; they are very original and well rehearsed.Overall a very fun and entertaining movie, regardless if you are a guy or a girl.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
More Bumps Than Grinds,"(Rating: ☆ ½ out of 4)This film is not recommended.In brief: The filmmakers can adjust their junk the best they can, but junk is still junk, no matter the size.GRADE: C-Life is filled with irony. While driving home after seeing the stud dud, Magic Mike XXL, the radio station began playing You Gotta Have a Gimmick from Gypsy, that classic show- tune about strippers. Fate? Coincidence? Bad luck? Whatever, it struck me as a sign of the times. The gimmick was there: The bodies are toned and well oiled. Their moves well choreographed and fluid. Sex is for sale once again in this sequel. Only this time around, the sleaze is on slow-boil and the meat has been tenderized for consumption. The sordidness of male strippers is on the back burner as this film version celebrates the legitimacy of male dancers as a serious art form. Really? This is pure (or impure) fantasy, totally devoid of any reality. With all of its come-ons and dirty dancing (and no frontal nudity), the film never satisfies its intended audience.Magic Mike XXL is not a serious expose about the sex business as its predecessor purported to be. The first installment tried to show the dirty side of the sex-for-sale business, with its sleazy show biz world on display. Not so here. This sequel is a simple dance movie with lots of sex thrown in. It's more interested in all the right moves, but there's very little reality, plot, or logic. This version has become a road movie as Mike (Channing Tatum) and his buddies, known as the Kings of Tampa, deciding to relive their glory days by putting on one last show, an encore performance to go out in style at a stripper convention in Myrtle Beach.Dare I say, directed (and I am using the term very loosely) by Gregory Jacobs and written (even more loosely) by Reid Carolin, Magic Mike XXL is silly and naughty fun, especially made for repressed gays or horny females looking for the cheapest of thrills. The film just may be perfect for bachelorette parties too, but as a movie-going experience, it's limp.The non-direction is the main reason for this erectile dysfunction of a movie. The film lacks any subtlety or good taste with its groping and in-your-crotch shots. The film's salaciousness overpowers any fun. But the film does treat both sexes with equal disdain: men are sexual objects and women are sex crazed nymphs. What a piece of work is man!The screenplay is an absolute mess. The dialog has an improvisational vibe that is incomprehensible most of the times and stilted the rest of the times. It wants to impress with hip rap, gangster swagger, and non-stop f-bombs, as if to say, ""I'm cool"", but it all comes across as just plain silly and labored. The story spends too much time meeting various characters that never amount to much. Scenes need judicious cutting and go on endlessly (a visit to a black private club, a meeting with some older repressed Southern ladies, a drug- filled night on the beach).Most of the choreography (by Alison Faulk) is sexual gyrations and simulated sexual posing, although it is hard to tell what action is being done on stage due to the lousy editing that is too close for comfort and rarely shows off the dance moves and some of the worst photography to be seen in a major studio film: ugly, grainy, out of focus and usually shot in a dinghy yellow-brown hue. Surprisingly, Steven Soderbergh mishandled both duties.The cast is uneven. Except for Mr. Tatum, who really can dance, Matt Bomer who tries to develop his ill-gotten pretty boy role, and the charismatic Joe Manganiello who truly looks the part, the others boy toys just mill around bonding and getting high or drunk. The most uncomfortable of the lot seems to be Kevin Nash as Tarzan who plays his role more Neanderthal than human. Also adding little to the film except for a winning smile and nice set of abs are Adam Rodriguez as Tito and comedian Gabriel Iglesias in the role as an unfunny stooge named Tobias. However the strangest part of the film is a tawdry cameo by Michael Strahan (of sports and talk show fame). His contribution, a graphic lap dance with an obese woman, is an embarrassment of bad taste that sets back women rights and questions the real motives of the filmmakers and this television personality's dubious career choices. Adding to this debacle are the wasted talents of Addie MacDowell, Elizabeth Banks, Amber Heard, and Jada Pinkett Smith.The dance showdown at the stripper convention peters out really fast (pardon the pun) with no real climax (again, my apologies) as the film follows its predictable conclusion. But there are some dance sequences that do work quite effectively: Channing's all too short scene in his ""body"" shop, an amusing segment with Mr. Manganiello in a convenience store, and the final dance-off involving mirror images of Channing and Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss (underused) that become an R-rated version of a So You Think You Can Dance routine. (It makes sense since the choreographer and dancer worked on that television show.)As that clever song from Gypsy so aptly states: ""If you wanna grind it, Wait till you refine it."" Magic Mike XXL hits more than its share of bumps than grinds, with no refinement in sight.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Pitch Perfect 2 again, pointless remakes",Well I'll start by saying I know these are movies about male stripping but I still take them seriously as films. So the first movie had way more stripping which is a common complaint about XXL by most women because you'd think the sequel would have more. However I think the reason is because the first movie was solely about the life of a stripper but XXL is more of an unexpected bro. road trip movie leading up to a stripper convention. The first Magic Mike however had more of a dark direction making it more dramatic and less fun whereas XXL is more vibrant and less dramatic. The main thing lacking from the first film was Amber Heard. The actress in the first film just had no presence on screen and showed no personality whereas Amber Heard is sort of your go to hot blonde perfect for playing these types of characters. I think the fact that there was no sex scene between Amber Heard and Channing or at least some sort of kissing was a waste. Their flirtatious relationship much like the film was lacking something more. I feel it was very much an unnecessary sequel but I can't say I wasn't entertained. It was hilarious and full of hot dudes but the raw and real edginess the first film had is gone. Reminds me of Pitch Perfect 2; one big letdown.,6.0,Anonymous,Music
Better than the 1st,"I thought it was funnier and pretty darn ENTERTAINING.Beginning starts out a bit corny.I liked how the group all does INDIVIDUAL dances at the big convention.I thought it had a pretty good story line. I will see again next on the big 55"" television. No one better be talking except asking if I need a refill.Guys get guns and violence. Women sometimes want raw & dirty. LOL. Don't let hating men spoil your fun, trust me it was worth a theater outing. Try not to drool to much on the way home.Did I mention how hot Manganello is ! That's a wrap.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Unexpected Fascination,"2012's Magic Mike wasn't exactly about the stripping. Sure, it features a lot of it, but the real center of the movie was the lifestyle of its main character, Mike. This latest installment showcases more of the crew and how they put up the show. It's more choreography driven than some commentary, which actually made it more appropriate to this material. It still has the stunning style of the first one, though it mostly feels quite forced, but if the movie tries to be itself, then there it actually shines. Magic Mike XXL indeed brings much of what you expect from it.While the first movie basically shows the art of its aesthetics, this sequel rather shows the art of stripping. The story isn't quite remarkable; it's so simple that it's nothing more than an excuse to show more of these acts, which is both a good thing and otherwise. But really, that's what the target audience really came here for. Just like the first one, it's all atmosphere than following a plot. We just see these characters trying to get along, hint some commentary, and do some stripping. The difference however is the stripping is the real showcase, as in the direction and choreography improves within that aspect which makes these performances speak what this movie is truly about. People would immediately think that this would only appeal female viewers, but even as a straight man as I am, I would actually be impressed by the choreography displayed on those scenes.The direction does try to keep Soderbergh's style going in this sequel, though only eschewing the intense sepia and welcoming other colors on the daylight. The new style is sometimes indefinite, specifically the vague lighting in some scenes, but then, the movie eventually breaks the pretense once the characters start dancing on screen, having more focus on their moves, and of course, bodies. Star, Channing Tatum, still has the charm as he always has. The other performers also get their characters expanded, staying natural whenever they bond and fight off on screen, treating them beyond than typical eye candy compared to the first one.Many may call Magic Mike XXL a totally needless sequel or a cash grab for those who seek for more endless dose of shirtless men, but I believe this movie actually exists to make up for its own value. The story may not be as meaty as its predecessor's, but it shows everything what its audiences actually wanted for it. And it is done elegantly, proving that stripping apparently has more to offer than just lust for flesh. It sounds incredibly weird if you say it that way, but looking at these performances seems like this is an art that we didn't see coming. Again, there's nothing remarkable about the story, though if you're curious about the appeal of this career, then it gives a room for fascination.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Magic Mike XXL. Don't watch it: I'm doing you a favor.,"I liked the first Magic Mike, I liked it a lot. I found it funny and interesting. It was entertaining. I thought that Channing Tatum was a really good dancer and, while watching, I regretted of not being a male stripper myself (beautiful life, lot of girls, you know).But this one is terrible. Boring, depressing I wonder who could really like it: girls? I doubt it. Men? Not a chance.I won't tell a word about the plot, as IMDb warns me not to do it. I will only state my disappointment for the lack of an entertaining story, a catching character or a good show. A terrible wasting of good actors and time.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Girls just wanna have fun,"Magic Mike XXL doesn't have an enticing storyline and I couldn't care less. It is all about female pleasure and friendship of the modern man.It is about supporting each other in times of need and cheering each other on, it's about finding your true self, it's about fighting and being friends again, it's about being comfortable with closeness and being open with emotions, it's about having sex and being friends, it's about finding the right one, it's about empowering women and their desires, it's about women of all skin colors, sizes and ages, it's about having a good time.I went to see the first movie with no expectations and really liked it, especially that it had some darker themes. The sequel is very different and much more of a ""feel-good movie"" and I don't just like it, I love it. When I went to see this movie, no one left the theater disappointed.Channing Tatum saw the trend that women do want sex and devour media even if it's trash (50 shades obviously), because there's nothing else out there. He gave us a movie that celebrates women, and men who are open-minded and supportive. Magic Mike XXL is very much a product of its time in the best possible way.

"I watched for Joe, Channing's dancing and hot bodies: Got what I wanted!!","The only negative I had with this movie was the Tito character- his hair was horrible and I just didn't find his dancing that good. Tarzan's wasn't good either but hey I give him a break bc it's freakin Kevin Nash... I just finished watching this on HBO and I must say I'm tempted to purchase the DVD. Although I don't find him very sexy my opinion is quickly changed when Channing Tatum danced in 2 Particular scenes in this. His performance at the ""pleasure house"" had me wishing I was one of those women he danced on (OMG). Then there's the finale with him and Twitch (I have to pause and gather myself bc I found Twitch to b soooo Sexy in this, I mean his body is banging and Mmm can that man dance). Probably one of the sexiest scenes I've seen in awhile PERIOD. Although I don't care for that particular type of RnB (present day mostly) it worked perfectly in those 2 scenes because the bass was knocking, it just added to the overall sexy ass environment... I'm 27 and I've never been to a strip club, now I'm not sure I want to bc I'm afraid the talent won't b as Amazing as Channing or Twitch lol...",7.0,Anonymous,Music
This film doesn't seem to know what it wants to be,"I wanna start this off by saying I did not enjoy the first movie. This was probably due to wrongful marketing. Like many hopeful ladies I was expecting a comedy with playful strip routines and hot men and was served up something sad and serious.For the sequel it was pretty much the same except this film wasn't sad, it was boring. For a film about ""A group of male strippers going to a stripper's convention"" this film has very little stripping in it. In stead it's filled with dialogue that is hard to follow and seems completely unnecessary. The first stripping happens like 40 minutes into the movie and it doesn't get better.If you were hoping for Pitch Perfect with male strippers you will be disappointed. There are no elaborately choreographed synchronized strip performances in this film. They do mostly solo performances where they manhandle their female clients in a way that made me as an audience member very uncomfortable.Overall I'm not sure what the target audience for this film is and I don't think the filmmakers know either, though I'm sorry to say this.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Looks like it's even better lady porn than the first,"So the thing about the first Steven Soderbergh directed Magic Mike is that it centered more around what it's like to be a ""male entertainer"", trying to show you that Magic Mike is not just a piece of meat and he has feelings and a dream (stop giggling). XXL acts more like a soft- core porn movie from the 90s Skinemax days only it's shot way better and its for the ladies.It's a formulated story about Mike,though his life out side of the strip game is successful, a run in with his old crew caused him to miss it, so when he discovers the gang is about to loose their jobs and go for the last big dance off at a strip convention, he joins them on the road trip.Along the way, Mike and the boys bond in a masculine appealing way that rivals the bromance that Entourage has. That keeps the movie interesting for any man whose woman is seeking revenge for dragging them to see all those action movies, by taking them to see this one.I must admit however, some of the routines were cool to see. After all, it would be cool if I could pick my woman up and spin her around my head toss her on her belly and dry hump her for a good 5 mins with the finesse that Magic Mike does it.Magic Mike is the center of attention of course, he's the title character and I must admit that Channing Tatum can move (I wish he was this aerobic in the G.I. Joe flicks) . My fav was a routine that he does with a Black Magic Mike (the fact that the movie has a black Magic Mike is hilarious). One thing about Magic Mike is that Tatum gets to be the block head he comes across as in a lot of other movies, but here it works.Joe Manganiello was funny as hell in this movie, but just like the first film it's so worth it to see ex-wrestling super star Kevin Nash stripping. I'm rolling on the floor with laughter.Don't expect much form this movie. it's not as innovate as the first. in fact certain sections of the movie act like a series of music videos (Check out the scene that introduces Rome, played by Jada Pinkette and Andre, played by Donald Glover (who gets to showcase his musical talent), but it still has a uniqueness to it, but I'm only saying that cause I've never seen a soft-core porn catered to women, and that's the only purpose of the movie, no matter how well it was shot it's only purpose is to please women. I can only assumed it did the trick.As for me, it was hilarious to see the formulated erotica I use to watch late night on Showtime as a teenager be done for the opposite sex.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Magic Mike takes his G-string and six pack on the road!,"The hunky fellas in the Magic Mike series aren't just pieces of USDA Grade A prime rib, they are people with feelings and stuff, or that is what the sequel Magic Mike XXL will lead you to believe.Mike steps out of retirement and takes a break from his contracting business to help his stripper friends from the Kings of Tampa have one mega-memorable performance at the Myrtle Beach stripper convention.Just as men get Playboy magazine for the articles, women watch Magic Mike XXL for the captivating dialogue and plot lines. Just kidding, of course we don't, we watch it to see these handsome dudes shake their a$ses and take their clothes off! The sequel definitely takes the dance routines to the next level. Just ask Joe Manganiello if he woulda bet that in his acting career he'd be doing a stripper routine in a Quickie Mart to Backstreet Boys ""I Want It That Way."" That's just the tipof the iceberg.And Magic Mike XXL has loads of good-natured self-aware hilarity in the form of objectifying sexiness. But the bromance antics and dynamic between the strippers with hearts of gold is what makes the film entertainingly watchable. Shifting the focus to the men of Tampa and their lives still leads to lulls in the plot, similar to what happens on an actual road trip.The absence of Mr. Matthew McConaughey is noticeable, and he is sorely missed, but the film still stands on its own. In a way, Magic Mike XXL is an improvement upon Magic Mike in that it removes the token but unnecessary romantic subplot that took up so much screen time in the original.Will men want to join their ladies when they inevitably head to the theaters to satiate their primal urges? Probably not. But that's okay. Magic Mike XXL makes no qualms about what it is and who it is for – and their audiences will be especially pleased.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly laid back and heartwarming,"Magic Mike XXL doesn't have much in the way off a plot but instead offers a surprisingly laid back and heartwarming film that's a fun celebration of male entertainers and the much needed joy they bring to people. It's also just really nice to spend 2 hours with these characters.Channing Tatum gives a great lead performance, unafraid to make fun of himself and all the better for it whilst still having a sense of authenticity. The rest of the cast all have a genuinely believable chemistry that makes their friendship and communion really endearing.Gregory Jacobs' direction is really good, always making sure the film looks nice and saturated to maintain the engaging yet easy going vibe. The pacing is strong overall, it does feel it's runtime but is always enjoyable and ends at the right moment.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Magic Mike XXL Review,"Mike and the gang are back. When we catch up with Mike, we see him trying to live his new life, retired from stripping and working for his custom furniture business. Despite being gone from his former profession and being away from his best friends, he still misses them and what he used to do. He misses the excitement and the feeling of being on stage. Opportunity soon comes knocking when his friends look him up as they travel to Myrtle Beach, S.C., for a stripper convention. With the promise of outrageous fun, he just can't resist the chance to join in and take it off again. Even though his friends looked him up again, resentment remains as some have not forgiven him for leaving them. Emotions run wild and hilarity ensues as Mike and the gang travel from Tampa to Myrtle Beach making stops along the way while healing wounds and meeting some new friends. This is their last ride and they want to leave on top and the gang goes through a journey of self-discovery to find out how to do that.I was surprised by how much I liked this movie. This movie was way more funny than I expected and I was also more entertained than I expected. This is due to the good script. The scenes where the guys were interacting with one another were just silly and fun. You can really see the chemistry that the actors have seeing that it is the second movie they have done together. The film's new additions all fit in nicely in a supporting role and didn't take away from the main plot. It took a while before we got any real dancing but when we did, it was very aerobic, energetic, and most importantly erotic. I personally thought that there should have been more dancing all around but the dancing we got was well shot and well done choreography-wise. I saw some things that I have never seen before. Sure it was a little too long, sure they could have done without a few parts that I will not mention. I can understand why they took that path since parading good looking people on screen will garner the attention of the ladies who are really whom this movie caters to. Oh the women in this movie, it hurt me on a personal level to see so much money rained on all the strippers shown in the movie. I hope the money being used wasn't real because I just kept imagining what I could have done with all that money. Overall, this movie is not as bad as some people are making it out to be but I can understand why people will stay away from this one. But if you are into guy movies (who happen to be strippers) or movies about guys (who happen to be strippers) coming together, you will not be disappointed.keithlovesmovies.com",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Magic Mike XXL"" doesn't have enough to satisfy.","It's early July. The movies duking it out at the box office include one about a Teddy bear which has come to life and another is about a group of male strippers. The year is 2012. That's right, the original ""Ted"" and the first ""Magic Mike"" hit theaters on the same day in late June 2012 and the first weekend in July saw them both going at it in Round 2 of their weekend box office competition. (""Ted"" beat ""Magic Mike"" at the box office each of those first two weekends, and every other weekend that both movies were in theaters.) Almost exactly 3 years later, each movie had a sequel in theaters, but with one big difference. ""Ted 2"" improved on the quality of its predecessor. ""Magic Mike XXL"" (R, 1:55) not so much.Mirroring the time between the two movies hitting theaters, the action in ""Magic Mike XXL"" takes place three years after the story of that handful of studly strippers leaves off at the end of the 2012 original. Mike Lane (Channing Tatum) is running his own custom furniture business, which was his motivation for leaving the ""Kings of Tampa"" at the end of the first film. He's living his dream, but without the girl of the same. His budding relationship with Brooke is no longer budding and, to be honest, his business is not exactly bearing a lot of fruit either. Mike decides to take a break from his life to try to rekindle that old Mike magic, and spend some time with his bros, not to so much to share a six pack, as to show off his.Most of the gang is back for the sequel (the most notable absence being Matthew McConaughey) and there are a few new sets of abs on screen as well. Mike joins the innocent-looking and spiritual Ken (Matt Bomer), sexually frustrated ladies' man Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello), mountain of a man Tarzan (Kevin Nash) as well as Tito (Adam Rodriguez) and Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias), whose characters aren't, ahem, fleshed out as well, on a road trip to a male stripper's convention in Myrtle Beach. Their transportation at the beginning of the movie is a food truck. (Insert beefcake joke here). By the time they arrive in South Carolina, they're down one teammate, but are cruising along in a much nicer ride.The guys also make some new friends along the way. In Savannah, they entertain a small group of rich southern women, including Nancy (Andie MacDowell), who happens to be the mother of some girls they met at the beach. Earlier, one of guys accepts a challenge to dance for an apparently humorless convenience store clerk in an attempt to make her smile, and they all dance at the private club of one of Mike's old, ahem, acquaintances, the confident, flamboyant emcee, Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith), in her private club for women, where they meet her performers, who may be familiar to fans of morning talk shows, quirky NBC sitcoms and freestyle hip-hop dancing (Michael Strahan, Donald Glover and Stephen ""tWitch"" Boss, respectively). Lastly, they gain a groupie of sorts in the person of a young female drifter named Zoe (Amber Heard), whose self-chosen nickname is too risqué for me to use in this review.""Magic Mike XXL"", despite its name, can be described in two words: not enough. There is a basic plot, but it's not enough. The story of the guys heading to a male stripper convention feels like just an excuse to put them in various situations where they can dance and act sexy. (If anyone reading this is tempted to remind me that that's what this movie is supposed to be about, I'd like to say that the first film had an actual plot, and a pretty well-constructed one at that.) The rapport and the banter among the guys and between Mike and Zoe is occasionally entertaining, but not enough of the time. The dancing (especially with the big buildup to Myrtle Beach) and the amount of skin on display is well, you get the idea. I can't imagine this movie really satisfying the target audience, much less the casual movie goer. ""C-""",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"While not as entertaining as its predecessor, Magic Mike XXL still has some good moments","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. Once again, this sequel to Magic Mike has a meandering quality that one may not be patient with and for a while, I was thinking this wasn't going anywhere. Still, me and my friend were intrigued enough to keep watching and by the end sequence, we were still reasonably entertained by the stripping performances. There were three good scenes here: first, there was a sequence of one of the ""male entertainers"" performing at the convenience store in order to make the female cashier smile. Second, there was Andie MacDowell's Southern charm when talking to them. And third, when Amber Heard gets the ride of her life with Channing Tatum on stage. So on that note, Magic Mike XXL is at the least, worth a look.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Not as good as the first episode,"Don't bother to watch Magic Mike XXL . It's not worth to go to cinema,and spend 2 hrs being miserable there. You try pretty hard to find something seems a little bit interesting in the last 30 mins. You just wanna kill yourself in the rest of the movie.I expected there's more dancing scenes or fun part. What I feel in the storyline wasn't very frequent, but irritated. I saw the first one, I don't really remember the details of it but at least I like it . The male entertainer or stripper makes the women look so cheap and dumb. Some of the scenes even make me feel sick. I'm sorry I feel that way but this movie can totally be on the worst movie list of mine.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
some series should stop at part one.,Just watched Magic Mike XXL and that's 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back! Was expecting a fun sequel with hunks dancing but what the viewers got was a story with no interesting plot that was all over the place and almost no striptease show. The stuff they did show was distasteful and I would go as far as saying GROSS! 3 years ago I was having so much fun while watching Magic Mike and when I saw the news we'll get a sequel I was expecting a clever continuation but it was serious disappointment. That's 10$ lost and a feeling of a wasted time which is a shame as Channing Tatuum is a great actor. The only positive part of the movie was Joe Manganiello who showed a fun character and entertainment.,1.0,Anonymous,Music

The antithesis to toxic masculinity?,"I forget who recommended MMXXL, but I'm glad they did.Let's get this out of the way; yes, there's ripped dudes dancing, but that takes a backseat to the core of the film's message.This is a road trip movie about grief and loss, healing, and finding strength through friendship. Every character has clear and distinct motivations. And each character has their own challenges that they must overcome in order to compete in the film's climactic dance competition.Slowly as the posturing stops and the walls come down, is when we learn what each character is actually going through and how much this trip actually means to each of them.Joe Manganiello, for example, as an insecure dude who is starved for intimacy was incredibly endearing, and his dance sequence in the gas station is hilarious.Even Tatum does a decent job here. Sure, the script doesn't give him a ton to work with. However, his interactions with one of the only other main women in the film comes across as very respectful and even tender. It's refreshing to see a platonic relationship depicted this way between a man and woman, especially in a film such as this.Should you seek this movie out? Absolutely. You might be surprised how relatable it is. Temper your expectations a little, and just enjoy the ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""XXL"" is right...","The title says it all. After 3 years of living a ""normal "" life, ""CEO"" of his own company in custom construction, Mike Lane decides to go on one last trip with the Kings of Tampa to Myrtle Beach - where an annual male stripper convention is held - for one last blow-out show.The show is without question the best part of the movie (and keep in mind - this movie caters to females who would love to go to a male strip club like the ones in Magic Mike, but have to settle for the movie instead). It's definitely a blow-out performance, and although I admittedly never finished the first movie, it's definitely way more scandalous than the performances I saw in the first Magic Mike.Other than the dancing scenes in strip clubs, the rest of the movie lacks sustenance. There are some pretty funny and awkward scenes (and lots and lots of chiseled abdominals ;)) but other than that - it's pretty much just a bunch of guys on a road trip. A typical friendship/bonding movie. At times it doesn't feel like a movie but just a glorified home movie of a group with MDMA thrown in the mix.It's not terrible. The scandalous stripping scenes make up for it. But that's the whole point of Magic Mike anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sexy, hot, exciting","I liked the film. I met well that his objective. The Movie is about strippers, I do not understand how some people imagined what would watch something romantic or intellectual.

Have funny scenes, dialogs about sexual equality, handsome men, not everyone with muscular bodies (Donald Glover), but are beautiful just the same. Jada is priceless and Tatum is very beautiful ... Honestly... The First Votes were more consistent. Hurrah the sexual freedom and more movies hot the female public !!!",,Anonymous,Music
Second but not better...,"""Magic Mike XXL"" is a movie which continues from where the first one finished but three years later. In this movie we watch how the lives of all the strippers changed in these three years and finally they all decide to go to Myrtle Beach to put on one a last blow-out performance.This movie was different from the first one because there was not as much dancing as it was in the first one and in order for the audience to not understand it they put more actors to play some small parts. Such as Andie MacDowell, Elizabeth Banks and Amber Heard. Unfortunately many people understood that and that was the main reason why this movie was not better than the first. Although there were some scenes with plenty of humour and that was something that tried to lift up the movie in some way.Lastly I have to say that ""Magic Mike XXL"" is a movie that had to be better than this and of course it had to be better than the first one. And that's because everyone will compare the second movie with the first and the important thing will be for the second one to be better than the first, and that did not happen in this.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

It was alright.,"Magic Mike XXL (2015) is the sequel to the surprisingly awesome Magic Mike (2012) except this movie wasn't directed by Steven Soderbergh which is a bad sign. Well I just got done watching the movie and it was okay.Positives for Magic Mike XXL (2015):
The returning cast is still great as these characters and they're doing the best they can with the script. You get some of the energy and excitement from the original in this movie. I also liked the additions of Donald Glover and Andie MacDowell as they add some new air to the movie. And finally, I can see the target demographic having some fun with this movie.Negatives for Magic Mike XXL (2015):
The movie feels like it was only made because of the massive success of the first movie. This movie has a Steven Soderbergh hole in its heart and it does have his style or energy attached to it. The movie is also missing Matthew McConaughey as he was the life of that first movie. And finally, I was very annoying and irritated by the presence of Amber Heard and Jada Pinkett Smith.Overall, Magic Mike XXL (2015) is a fine continuation of the original, but it lacks the element that made the first movie such an entertaining movie for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"This had no real story. On the other hand I am a guy, not the target audience & the reason most women watch isn't for the plot","""It's not bro time, it's show time. Are you guys ready?""

"Just some light-hearted fun and comedy, oh, and strippers","When you review movies, there is occasionally that film that comes along that is not marketed to you at all, doesn't appeal to you at all, yet you still decide to sit through it and hopefully come out on the other end awake at least; this, was that film. This film was not made for me and i was not interested in the film, so before deciding to check this out i genuinely thought i was going to hate this film, but after watching it, there was just something about it that made this movie a surprisingly enjoyable one. I gotta say it; i actually enjoyed Magic Mike XXL. For the most part it is just a fun movie with a good amount of comedy and likable characters that happens to be about strippers. The film struggles with pacing during the second act but i would say the fun light-hearted tones during the first and third acts made up for it. I did not see the first Magic Mike so i was being introduced to these characters for the first time in this film and i gotta say, the film-makers did a great job at quickly introducing or re-introducing these characters in a way that gave me a quick overview of their personality and allowed the film to just move on. This really helped me get behind these characters' actions throughout the film, well for most of the film.The first 40 minutes of this movie i really enjoyed, it felt like a road trip film with a group of guys who had good chemistry and it was really funny. The film wasn't taking itself seriously, it knew it was just here to entertain its target audience so it had fun with setting up surprisingly very well choreographed 'dance' scenes that not only appealed to the female audience but i thought was some pretty good comedy that got me laughing quite a bit. Everyone played their part in making this section entertaining, Channing Tatum, Joe Manganiello, and Gabriel Iglesias were the drivers of this comedy and were putting in good performances. I won't spoil anything but at a certain moment an event happens and in a heartbeat the film just flipped its overall tone and just lost me. It ditched the light-hearted, careless fun tone and the fast pace for a more slow, plot driven, and i guess meaningful tone. It was almost like one guy wanted a fun comedic film and someone wanted a serious stripper film so rather than picking one, they went with both and split it down the middle. And for the next 45 minutes i was just barely hanging in there with the hope that it would go back to what was good in the first act.But despite the very slow and quite uninteresting middle portion of the film, the relatively short third act bought back some of the fun from the first act and some 'interesting' dance routines that actually helped the film finish off kinda strong despite the vent end going by really quickly. This is one of the surprises of the year, i never thought i would come out of a film about male strippers saying that i actually somewhat enjoyed it, but i really did. If you are a female then yes you will most definitely like this movie i don't need to tell you that, otherwise if you are not, you probably won't, but there is some fun to be had if you don't focus on the fact that you are watching a movie about almost naked men dancing. - 5.8",6.0,Anonymous,Music
silly waste of time,"Decided to forgo the R rating and inevitable sickening language in order to enjoy some eye candy doing amazing dancing. Wrong, as we had about 5 minutes of dancing. The rest of the film was just silly, inane filth. It's hard to imagine such debauchery actually exists in the world. I am ashamed of everyone who participated in this disgusting project, including myself for contributing to its revenue. I read somewhere that Channing was dismayed to have to work out in prep for his request to do it again (I didn't see the first one) but it turns out HE was the producer. I guess the almighty dollar won out over good taste. I'm so disappointed in Andie McDowell, Jada Pinkett Smith and Michael Strahan that they lowered themselves to this sickening nastiness and will find it hard to view any future projects of theirs.

A Movie for Women,"This was such a lovely, fun and feminist movie. Its main objective was to bring a smile to woman's face and make her feel appreciated and worshiped. And the movie managed it.For the Kings of Tampa, more than the last ride, this was a way to escape their mold and create their own path. To face their dreams outside of the stage. It was really great to get to know the characters more and to see their friendship. It is clear the boys spent some time not only in the gym but also in a dance studio in preparation for this movie. And it was appreciated. A lot :)I love how this movie concentrated more on showing the stripping is for the woman. And while I don't think I would feel comfortable in those situations, it was clear the women enjoyed being cherished and it was also wonderful to see so many different women and different ways appreciation can be shown.I also liked the character of Rome and Jada did a wonderful job with her. She was all about the women.This is a movie for women in a way that very few movies are. And that is why women should go to see it. For pleasure. And men should go see it as well.

"Sexy for all genders and persuasions, but a lite, silly entertainment","Not one of the greatest moments in film dance history or even soft porn fantasy, but a summer comedy high on male buffness and little in elegant dialogue. Bros on the road flick thanks to a roach coach transport, these ""male entertainers"" aka strippers decide to give it one last go before hanging up their thongs. Given that premise, there are girls to pleasure, rich WASPs to snog, and the latent young woman who is defiant and self-possessed who must be charmed by dance-man Channing Tatum. Although a better than average street dancer, Mr. Tatum is not the sole dance eye-candy. Trying to demonstrate that he is seeking a better and more normal life than that of gypsy strip king, Tatum's character runs a furniture design shop but hits the road with his buddies because of friendship.Joe Mangienello is more vocal and takes second lead to make audiences drool with his parody of the Cindy Crawford Pepsi commercial of yore. Other men such as Matt Bommer add to the storyline but minimally as the story basically follows a Jada Pinkett-Smith/Tatum reunite, nevertheless, their chemistry lacking, the age difference remained too obvious to hold any interest. In fact, there are more ladies of a certain age (Andie MacDowell) throughout with the exception of Mrs. Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, who gets the dream role of a gymnastic lap dance from Tatum.In the end, the guys get to strut, local ladies get a chance to toss dollar bills at some of the hunkiest actors in Hollywood, and the film ends with a happy group hug. The subtle homo-erotic interplay with the males keeps the film from becoming too estrogen-centric, and the ladies of size are also well represented in front and center stage antics. The representation of every and all makes this film PC, but at my screening, the theater was almost empty, and Anglo women 20- 50 the principal audience.

"Hilarious, joyful, exuberant play - just let go and enjoy the ride","I loved this film. It is hilariously funny, it has a great soundtrack, and watching Tatum dance like melted butter is a joy in itself. It is also filled with all sorts of types of men and women, who are being remarkably kind to each other, it keeps tickling you with the beginnings of what could be stockpile templates but then verges away.Don't take this film literally – how flimsy is the premise of a lot of fiction films? -, enjoy its visual exuberance, and take the sexual as the embrace of kindness and love for people and longing for connectedness that it is. At one point, Tatum is basically confronted with a version of the argument that his story doesn't add up, and he basically offers a clue to how to read the film when he replies, clumsy-cute: Look this isn't about (fill in literal interpretation of the plot), this is about you and me (putting things behind/doing something together)This is the joy of play – play as simulation, make belief, the joy of the process and the ride that is life. Written down, this weepy and pathetic whereas the film just offers this up in emotion, movement, and music: Embrace life, joy, and people, as they are, be kind to each other, believe in your dreams and especially your friends – you may fail, but you will try, and the dreaming is part of the fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

What we get are a bunch of guys yakking, some very annoying hip hop music and the dancing is not interesting or sexy and I am sure even the females would be bored with the lack of flesh or just not interested to see wrestler Kevin Nash baring even his chest.This is a cash in of the most cynical kind.

One of the major theme is something they talk about a lot in the film: the idea of being everything this person you're dancing for in this moment needs, everything this woman needs right now, you can give that to her and she loves you for it. It's philosophical. The film explores the strange beauty of that. They dance because they love it, they've chosen a legitimate career bringing happiness to the ladies of the world. Characters are all rethinking the male burlesque but it's exactly the same thing all over again for the muscly strippers, except with no Matthew McConaughey this time around. Channing Tatum is a very good dancer, but there's none of the physical brilliance of Tatum's performance in the Oscar worthy wrestling movie Foxcatcher; nor the wit and fun of his cop in 21 & 22 Jump Street.This film really deals with the camaraderie among those men, the conversations they have about what they do, their view point on their position in life and the way they affect the women their dancing for. While the draw of handsome men in their underwear is obvious, it's the chemistry between them that makes Mike Magic. These laid-back ladies' men manage to be blocky and vulnerable, in their geniality, old fashioned manners and tendency to put women on a pedestal. They're a welcomed antidote to the obnoxious all-male ensembles that have become mainstream in commercial comedy (Earliest Entourage being the best example). The attitude is that we all (mostly) know why we're here and let's have a good time! Writers have junked the do-I-really-want-to-be-a-male-stripper concept which allegedly gave the first movie depth, or at any rate some dramatic interest. There's no narrative pull or jeopardy about anything that happens on screen. Even the movie reminds you , just before its final showdown, that there's nothing at stakes here, nothing to be won or lost. Just the joy of amazingly sculpted bodies in motion. This fact increased the quotient of pure entertainment by lowering its ambitions. Stripping isn't comic or tragic: it's just great! However the film is actually a lot deeper than you might expect; with a quick witted script that refuses to take it all seriously as its simply notes the passage of time while stressing the importance of living in the present and making the most of your gifts. Their ideas is to make all the ladies in their audience feel special and catered, that it's about them but in a self consciously fun way, not as dominance.We're all invited to believe that this is of course not demeaning or ironic but romantic and fun. In this consciously fun way a positive energy is building throughout the movie from scene to scene until the explosive finale. Indeed, it's a gorgeous looking and beautifully shot movie (in every possible way...), with excellent cinematography and lightning, very similar to the first one. This isn't the MTV movie the trailer tries to make you think it is. Moreover, I may not be entirely over this fantastic gaz station scene, involving Joe Manganiello and a Backstreet Boys' song. Freaking good! Plus, there's one moment when the movie regain its soul and comes alive in its goofy way; it's when Mike is in his workshop, brooding about the possibility of hitting the road again and he improvises a little dance routine around his saws, drills and workbench. It's silly, but there's some flair, mostly because it's not weighed down with mock sexiness and the need to patronise women with naughty but nice pelvic thrusting. Finally, Magic Mike XXL is set in the real world too but delivers more of that original promises: you want the hottest male strippers, you got them. It may be the gayest straight film ever made or the straightest gay one and I don't care either way because this film is ridiculously entertaining.Overall, this film might be deceptive for a certain demographic because it's actually a well shot, well filmed, dealing with interesting and well acted character. In some ways Magic Mike XXL is the film that many feared the original might be (and wasn't). Channing Tatum still packs a bagful of charm along with his merry band of male strippers.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Aging strippers on a roadtrip,"I wasn't expecting much from this based on the first movie but you still have to see it, right. I'd hoped for a better story this time or more actual stripping but nope, this is more of the same except even worse. Story as it were follows retired stripper Channing Tatum as the band gets back together to put on that ""one last show"" at an exotic dance convention in Myrtle beach. For the most part this is a road trip movie and that's about it.There's no real storyline here, no interesting side bars, zero character development, the dialogue is long, meandering and hard to follow (actually I think they made it up as they went along.)There are a couple of cool dance sequences, but no choreographed routines or stripping per se just dance moves (or singing) and aggressive man handling of female spectators. Joe Manganiello does a very sexy act towards the end and I also liked the 30 seconds Channing bumps and grinds in his workshop while attempting to get his groove back and that's about it.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Bump and grind - and not much else,"The first MAGIC MIKE movie had something (not much) to say about the economic pressures that might drive a young, generously-endowed man to find an alternative' career in the world of 'male entertainment'. This sequel doesn't bother with much motivation; unfortunately, it also doesn't bother with much plot.After shouty scenes between Mike and the other Kings of Tampa on the Bill and Ted-type road strip we get screamy scenes in Savannah at a kind of cathouse-for-ladies run by an old flame of Mike's (Jada Pinkett Smith). In the closest this film gets to the irony that was occasionally present in the first movie, the club's clients are mostly black women, brandishing fistfuls of dollars which they throw onto the dance floor rather than tucking them into trunks and thongs. Clearly Obama in the White House has done wonders for the empowerment - and enrichment - of black women. A similar scene ensues in the finale at Myrtle Beach - more shouting and screaming - when Mike and the Kings get to strut their routines at the strippers' convention.I'm probably not part of this movie's 'demographic', although I like to see buff gents in the buff as much as the next (gay) man. We seem to have come a long way from the Chippendales. The guys don't just strip and bump and grind, they now simulate sex acts on lucky (unlucky?) women from the audience. Like the whole movie, it's lewd and it's raunchy, but subtle it ain't.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
I loved it!,"I absolutely loved it! so much better that the 1st one! You can't really expect for it to have a great story line as it was 2nd film and it's all about the show?! If you as a woman can't enjoy a bit of a show from few sexy men, then sorry..go back to your boring marriage life. Shows were great, I couldn't stop smiling, great entertainment! All of the boys were brilliant dancers, film uplifts your mood, and makes women feel special, what's wrong about that? It can be quite cheeky, women love it tho!I'd never say it's a film to watch with your husband unless he can appreciate art.

Straight Up Eye Candy That Lacks So Much,"We all remember that summer three years ago, when that masterpiece of a movie known as Magic Mike graced *has to stop writing because he is laughing so hard* I can't even begin to describe the faults with the stripper movie, yet someone thought it was a good idea to make a second one. Yet here I am on the first of July jumping into review the latest woman targeted film, which had plenty flocking to the local theater. Gear up my friends, and get set for another wild reviewing ride from yours truly.As a disclaimer, I'm looking at this movie for quality, not on it's ability to entertain, two terms many seem to group together. Thus, you can bet that Magic Mike 2's quality certainly doesn't bode well in terms of a good film. One more the plot is slop, a culmination of shallow story writing to flimsily support the sequences of shirtless men dancing in numerous settings. The theme of our tale SEX masked in the constant iteration that it's all about respect and living your dream. I applaud their attempt to put other aspects in the film to develop Mike (Channing Tatum) and his crew's characters, but to me the writers couldn't figure out what path to take so just hastily pasted them into the script. These tangents did nothing more than waste time, as they conveniently provided opportunities for our strippers to show us their talents, while ""helping"" out the community in the process.What made the tangents even worse is that there wasn't good dialogue to save the stupid, pointlessness that they were. Many times I expected some kind of romantic banter, or some hot insult that helped sell the ""tension"" in the group. Instead, the writers fail again, filling our boys mouths with cheesy innuendos, horrible pick up lines, and a bombardment of F words. Glad to see such talent coming our way for future movies. Most of the time the dialog wasn't funny, and they had Gabriel Iglesias in the film, and he can really dish out some memorable quotes. The excuse of this movie wasn't targeted at being funny is a shallow explanation for two reasons. First, Magic Mike XXL is characterized as a comedy and that usually means laughing. Second what woman doesn't like to laugh? Instead, the team decided to ditch the fluffy man early in the movie, and open up space for Jada Pinkett Smith, and her link to Mike. The acting itself didn't help either, with only Smith, Tatum, and Donald Glover really doing anything I can consider decent, the former of which still surprises me she agreed to this movie.You can see there is a lot of bad to this movie, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't address some of the positives present, despite how limited they are. We know most are going to this film for the gorgeous beefcakes lighting up the stage. You'll be glad to know that Mike and his buddies are back in all their sweaty glory, six packs and all glistening in the lights. Women in my theater were grinding into their seats, making accompanying noises, as the men grinded about the women. The stripper squad will tease female audience members in many ways, some involving syrup, sprinkles, and even stuff at out of 50 shades. Women will scream, giggle, and drool, while men will shake their head, groan is dismay, or like me try to gouge their eyes out. However, past the bumping and grinding, the dance numbers are actually impressive, especially when Tatum busts out his moves and shows some impressive feats of strength. I have to give the design team some props for their creative numbers as well, the choreography quite impressive at times when you see the coordination, before it transforms back to light porn. A music soundtrack helps out as well, all of the numbers capturing the mood and going with the setting. Unfortunately most are hip-hop and rap tracks with a focus on guess what SEX, which has become stale for me at this time.Overall, Magic Mike is a bumping, grinding, stripper experience that does its job of being eye candy. It's got moves, it's got tunes, and it's got the sexual hard core drive though with a little more finesse. Fans of the first one are going to most likely enjoy this installment, perhaps to the point of a third installment ""gracing"" the screen. The movie lacks in a lot of things though including story, acting, comedy, and class; plus it could have used some major editing to bring down the time limit. No surprise that I can't recommend a theater trip for this one, except for those looking for single minded body thrills and gawking at abs the size of a wall. Factoring in everything, my scores are:Comedy, Drama, Musical: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.5",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Worst movie ever?,"This film comes close to failing on every imaginable level - but even fails to accomplish that, as one scene (one, single) is actually funny. The rest of the movie is cringe worthy, utterly predictable, totally formulaic (hence predictable, fair enough), exceedingly tacky, repetitive and incredibly boring. Towards the end it becomes so bad that it is actually funny, but most of the time, you don't even get that. The only good thing about watching a movie like this is that it gives you a real appreciation for how difficult it actually is to make a good movie. Some of it might have looked good on paper, a lot of the scenes/dynamics worked well in the (good) movies they were copied from and yet, here, they just fall completely flat on their face (not literally, no spoiler here).",1.0,Anonymous,Music
The storyline is boring,"The storyline is boring, nothing really exciting.However looking at it from a retired dancer's perspective; the choreography is great, footwork and body movement a really good.It's really the dancing and hot men who are making it worth watching.If you asked me to tell you the plot of Magic Mike XXL or the storyline, I can't. I was scrolling on Instagram in between the dance scenes because the movie simply couldn't keep my attention.Magic Mike XXL is for people who want to watch hot men taking their clothes off, and are not interested in the story.... Of if you are like me, interested in dance and watching Magic Mike XXL as a dance movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"XXL is for extra extra large..dialogue, boring bits and plot holes","It was a long, odd and unexpected telling of a very short story. I won't go into a synopsis of the story: you can read other reviews for that. Maybe the marketing of the movie had something to do with the resulting disappointment. Had been marketed as more 'cerebral' then the viewer would be better prepared. But since it was touted as 'hot dancing' that's what you're waiting for. And you do wait.There's so much dialogue. The script needed a brutal editing: the essential plot points and character 'developments' should have come out much quicker. The dialogue between Mike and the female interest when they meet is obscure. If they had the conversation they have nearly half the movie later, at that point, it would have established the character interplay more effectively. There were quite a few conversations had that make that little voice in your head ask, ""What's this about? Why are we getting this information from the character?"" Ken and a new character have a long conversation in the front of the car about singing, but it too, could have been edited to make the point more clearly and quickly.The 'MC-ing' (the Mcconaughy job in the original) was over-done. It slowed the movie down to snail's pace. Stripping is all about ENERGY and the movie had none. It wandered along delving into corners and backing out again without adding value to the plot. (This might be a spoiler) Their truck goes off the road early in the movie because the driver fell asleep and the movie does the same.The production values were noticeably low. The background sound transitions were non-existent: scenes were just slammed up against each other. This can be for dramatic effect (sparingly) but it was like home video just stuck together. Again, with the two guys in the front of the car, the driver slapped his knee six times while delivering his lines. Those sounds wouldn't be picked up by the boom mic so foley artists would add it back in post production but why? It was an irrelevant distraction to the scene.Tatum seems very relaxed in his role. Apparently these two Mike movies have loosely been about his performance roots: he was a stripper in his early days. He is listed as a producer but a script writer but maybe he was bringing back 'the old days.' There's nothing wrong with that but you have to bring back the essence, the atmosphere and emotion, not all the detail.Joe Manganiello and Matt Bomer stole the show out from under Tatum's over-grown-skater-dude's nose. These charactersdeveloped, somewhat unevenly, throughout the plot but gave it depth and heart. Without that the movie would have been unwatchable as there would have been nothing left to hold your interest. Yes, there's some skin and a little bit of 'dancing' but there's way better movies for that(even Tatum's STEP was better.)There were three good scenes which, in order of goodness, were (I don't think these spoil anything):1. Tatum and the garage table. He's having fun and takes us with him. It's early in the movie and promises good things to come (that don't.)2. Joe and the drink machine. Again, outright fun while developing the character. It's a pity there wasn't more of this type of scene in the movie. It would have rounded out all the characters.3. Matt Bomer and ""Heaven."" I think the girls will like this bit and not for the reason you might think. It was just really touching.So when the plot finally reaches it's 'peak' it's pretty flat and lacking energy. This is where the voluminous mc-ing from Jada Pinkett Smith is just plain annoying. She played her character well, there was just way toooooo much of it. This whole section of the movie should have been longer(more dancing), but contrastingly, seriously edited to be much tighter (more dancing).Again, this might be a spoiler, but you get the impression that some of the boy crew can't dance. And If not, I still wouldn't have bothered trying to disguise it. While the plot might have been trying the 'live your dream at least once' angle I don't think that was done the least bit convincingly. I would have dumped (edited) all those ancillary routines into one and cut it very short, and if the mc-ing was still needed (the plot forced it a little) then it could have been put over the top and gotten out of the way much more quickly. It took too long to lead up to too little.It may sound like I hated it. I didn't. But I certainly didn't love it. Those three scenes saved it for me. Even the surprise that the movie had tried (but somewhat, failed) to have more depth than the marketing would have us believe, was a nice surprise. It's a shame it didn't quite come off. I think an experienced script editor could have easily rescued it.As for Tatum, I don't know if he's a good actor or just very comfortable in his skin. This movie didn't ask much from him. He delivers his lines with conviction and you get the feeling the dialogue hasn't taken him too far from home. However, I'm hoping this is the last of his over-grown-skater-dude movies. Yes, that's how I described him before and that's how he turns up in most of his movies: big dopey kid cruising around the set with his baseball cap on backwards, and dragging at his over-sized jeans. I think he's capable of much more and hope he goes and tries. As Game of Thrones put it "" Kill the boy and let the man take over."" Maybe with this XXL meandering down memory lane will let him put the past to rest and he can move on.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Why Such Harsh Reviews?,"The boys came back with a bang! Magic Mike XXL was far superior to the first Magic Mike. It was funny, entertaining, and had a fantastic vibe celebrating all types of women. They really got it right making the women in the film feel important and valued just for being them and the overall message was very positive about women being celebrated and appreciated no matter what size, age, or color they happen to be.As far as the dancing goes, it was fantastic. Very entertaining and there's a particular scene with Joe Manganiello in it that will have everyone doubled over laughing and all of the women drooling. There were some new guys who were featured in the film that I thought were fantastic dancers as well.They didn't try to incorporate any awkward plot lines that didn't fit with the theme of the movie, which they did in the first one. They kept this movie flowing all the way through with laughs, entertainment, and fantastic dancing. All of the guys played their characters very well. Matt Bomer in particular. This movie is obviously geared more towards women but there are several men that would enjoy the humor interlaced throughout the film.Overall I give Magic Mike XXL 9/10. It's the perfect summer movie to take friends to for some great laughs and to feel like you're along for the party with some ""male entertainers"" that know how to have a good time.

"Finally, the Magic!","This film was perfect - sexy, silly, fun, cheesy, ridiculous, dancing, singing and focus on female pleasure.Yes, please - I'd gladly have some more!I can't believe I've only seen it now and it totally made my day - I remember trying to get a girls' party together to go to the cinema at the time but we could't quite manage - a pity. I would have loved to see it on a big screen surrounded by excited audience.This is the Magic Mike that I wanted - the first one was great as far as Channing Tatum's story was concerned however that ""poor little spoilt boy"" addition was quite unfortunate, unnecessary and unconvincing. I just didn't buy it. The love interest could have been a little more attractive as well. Well, never mind that now the good stuff arrived!Here we have everything: sight of fit naked backside in the first 3 minutes, a prank, Channing's wet-suit Mr Darcy moment, cheesy banter, ""My Pony"" solo and that's just the start. Fun all the way and focus on the right things: friendship, doing what you like and are good at, working at being a good performer, having fun and giving women what they want.Some moments are so cheesy that I laughed out loud - but it's meant to be a bit ridiculous and not taking itself seriously.I loved every minute of it. Even over-the-top faux romantic singing. Channing - yes. Yes. The best in hot and exciting dancing ever, hands down. He moves like he was born to dance - like he loves it. Poetry in motion, need I say more!I actually loved that there was no actual sex in this film - it reminds me of some of those teasing sex-bomb comedies from the 50s where women are portrayed as over-the-top sexy, cheesy and silly - only here we have a gender reversal.

"Occasionally fun, but ultimately forgettable stuff","After the cult success of Steven Soderbergh's Magic Mike (2012) - a loose adaptation of star Channing Tatum's experiences as a stripper (or male entertainer) early on in his career - it was of little surprise when a follow-up was announced. What made the first movie such a surprising success was the way it mixed the flashy dance moves with genuine character development, making for a touching and oddly sweet experience that also touched on themes such as the economy and the American Dream. For XXL, the focus seems to be solely on giving the audience what they want, and that means more abs, biceps and bulges.However, this all means a half-arsed story-line that quickly finds a way to get 'Magic' Mike (Tatum) back with his gyrating buddies. The end of the first film saw Mike abandon the life he was never truly happy with and realising his dream of starting his own company selling custom-made furniture. The company is either struggling or about to take off, but it's clear that Mike is still unfulfilled, and when he receives a phone message from Tarzan (Kevin Nash), he is soon enough on the road to a stripper convention with 'Big Dick' Richie (Joe Manganiello), Ken (Matt Bomer), Tito (Adam Rodriguez) and Tobias (Gabriel Inglesias). That's generally it. Magic Mike XXL's main issue is that the story seems to fumble around trying to come up with interesting places to take its characters.Very much a road movie at heart, the group find themselves encountering new characters along the way. With Cody Horn not returning (her disappearance is rather unconvincingly explained,) the love interest this time around is Zoe (Amber Heard), a gorgeous bohemian-type who doesn't seem to be put of by Mike's distinctly douchebag-y dress sense. There's also Andie MacDowell as a horny Southern lady who, along with her wine-guzzling friends, indulge in a private party. Mike also hooks up with his old friend/lover/colleague Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith), a sort-of stripper madame who hosts a house to entertain the ladies, and whose employees include the smooth-talking Andre (future young Lando Calrissian Donald Glover). There is sadly no return for Matthew McConaughey as Dallas or Alex Pettyfer as The Kid, who have apparently both eloped to Europe chasing a lucrative stripping deal. Gregory Jacobs also replaces Soderbergh as director.The new characters provide to be little more than a distraction from the meandering plot, which forces Mike and his pals into a few moments of utter tedium. When the film stays with the guys and just allows them to shoot the s**t, it's actually very funny, and leads to the best scene of both movies by letting a pilled-up Richie loose on a grumpy-looking gas station clerk. By trying to do more by giving each character their own emotional arc, it actually holds back a film that would be better served giving the audience even more of what they really came for, stripping. Even for a straight male, the dance scenes are electrifying, with the climax delivering an all-out dance-a-thon that allows each character their moment to shine. It made me smile between the dull moments, but this is ultimately forgettable stuff.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Extra Extra Small,"Not much to say as there's not much in it, half the nudity if that, forgettable generic radio hip hop soundtrack. 30% of the story of the original. Quite boring in a lot of places. I guess it was suppose to be a sort of road trip movie, which failed to go anywhere. The dance sequences were quite boring and tame. I think they did manage to strip beyond a swimsuit down to a thong about 40% of the time. All in all a very poor comparison to the original. Although I found a few scenes, such as the drag bar, funny and smile worthy. It was just not a good film at all, and had so little of the sex appeal of the original that I was pretty shocked. I figured with the success of the first, they would step it UP, instead they actually tamed it down. Overall not much worth a real watch, maybe just fast forward to the decent sequences = skipping 60% of the movie, something most did not find themselves doing in the original.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Strippers on a road trip,"You could fault the first Magic Mike for many things. But you couldn't say that it didn't have a story. Didn't matter if you liked it or not or if you didn't want to either see Dudes stripping or female nudity (the latter being said by a female friend of mine who minded that being on ""display""), it did have something to tell. Now why do I say that? Because this movie does not have anything to say at all.Apart from men stripping (whether they have their shirts on or off shouldn't matter, it's not always about the pecs and flesh, but about what they do with their bodies) - and there is enough suggestions as to what they'd like to do. While that may seem tame to some (see some other reviews), it does seem risqué to some others (again reviews checking). But it does not hide the fact, that this rode trip is boring. Jada Pinkett Smith was surprisingly not nominated for an Oscar - even more surprisingly it wasn't the reason she boycotted the Oscars (I am kidding but feel free to like or dislike the joke).While the movie knows it doesn't have any plot it also does not have enough jokes to keep it up ...

"A dud dramatically, but a delight when the clothes come off.","In the three years since its release, Magic Mike has infiltrated the cultural lexicon as shorthand for something racy, sexy and a tad naughty, generally involving gyrating male strippers whose performances are anything but kid-friendly. That's actually rather ironic, since anyone who's actually watched Steven Soderbergh's film would know that the stripping wasn't the point of his film at all. It was, in fact, window dressing for the rather dour drama surrounding its leading man. Magic Mike XXL hews far closer to its packaging. When the guys strip off and down, the film is a rousing crowdpleaser. When they don't, it meanders through a close-to- plot less no-man's-land, trying (and mostly failing) to recreate a little of the original film's glum gravity.Mike (Channing Tatum) has finally left the stripper game to set up his own furniture business. Things aren't going too well when he meets up with his old stripper pals again, all of whom have have lost their jobs following the unceremonious departure of their seedy boss/handler (Matthew McConaughey's magnetic Dallas, who doesn't appear in the film). Resolving to go out with a bang at the upcoming stripper convention in Myrtle Beach, the guys embark on a road trip across America - one that brings them new inspirations and connects them with old friends.As a film, there isn't much to Magic Mike XXL. The plot is rickety, at best, purporting to explore the inner depths of these men but rarely getting below the surface. Mike is frustrated that his dreams haven't worked out the way he thought they would; Ken (Matt Bomer) has bigger ambitions as an actor that fell by the wayside on his way to becoming a real-life Ken doll; 'Big Dick' Richie (Joe Manganiello) is afraid to break free of the routines planned for him by Dallas; Tito (Adam Rodriguez) wants to start up his own frozen yoghurt business. But very little of it rises above the level of inconsequential. Instead of tackling these ideas head-on, Reid Carolin's script sidesteps them - either by listlessly providing Mike with a new, woefully underwritten romantic prospect (Amber Heard) or flinging in yet another frenetic dance sequence performed by a barely clothed man.The road-trip aspect of the film plays out as a sort of bizarre fever dream, boasting a couple of good ideas that get worn out very quickly. When an accident robs them of both emcee and vehicle, Mike hooks up with Rome - a role originally written for a man, but played with savvy, sultry aplomb by Jada Pinkett Smith. There's something quite thrilling about Rome's dark, seductive establishment, clearly set up to give black women a safe space to indulge in flights of escapist fantasy. The dudes also blunder into an upper-class home filled with older white ladies - led by Andie MacDowell and her extreme Southern accent - all repressed and in need of a little sexual healing.These are great, fun ideas to start with, hinting at the desires and sexuality of entire subsets of women who are usually forgotten by the mainstream media. But they lose both point and impact as the movie rambles on, unfolding in long, almost languorous stretches that would benefit from a little punch and editing. (Apologies, Mr. Soderbergh, but it's true. And yes, it was Soderbergh who cut the film together under the pseudonym 'Mary Ann Bernard', and also doubled up as its cinematographer, Peter Andrews.) It doesn't help, either, that director Gregory Jacobs - promoted from first assistant director on Magic Mike - favours a faux art-house vibe for what is essentially an incredibly mainstream film: his actors mumble their way through not particularly meaningful bursts of dialogue, shot in portentous shadow when away from the spotlight and jockstraps.What Magic Mike XXL does have going for it is, well, the stripping. Unlike the first film, which regales anyone who buys a ticket for the beefcake with healthy servings of moody drama about drained finances and male pride, the stripping is the unqualified highlight of this entire experience. Richie's goofily sincere attempt to make a grim gas station attendant smile is as silly, charming and sexy as the huge set-pieces performed by Mike and his buddies when they finally make it to the convention. It's impossible not to be tickled by the ways in which these guys strut their stuff and - in a nice, earnestly cheesy touch - do it all just to make ordinary women smile. After all, when presented in so altruistic a fashion, who could fail to be charmed by Tatum's ultra-slick dance moves, Bomer's beautiful singing voice, and Manganiello's outrageously chiselled body?If you're hoping for a film that faithfully replicates Soderbergh's more sombre, thoughtful Magic Mike, you'll be sorely disappointed. The brooding drama and man-pain were, secretly, the point of the first film. In contrast, this looser, sillier and upsized effort - hence the XXL in the title - does exactly what it says on the tin and more. Indeed, it fumbles precisely when it tries to pump up its narrative with anything less flimsy than a G-string. But, come purely for the eye candy, and you'll be amply rewarded with many saucy, sexy scenes of scantily clad men dancing around, over and on top of utterly delighted women.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Absolutely horrible,"I enjoyed the first one. I was looking at the clock 15 minutes into this one.I stuck with it, but it never got better. The plot was stupid and there was not one redeeming scene to even mildly save the movie.Definitely in the top 10 of worst sequels.Avoid this like The Plague.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Just not my cup of tea.,"I have seen the first part and I don't remember I felt the same way as I did for this. My point is, this film is for women and maybe that including the gays. Being a straight male, I find it's not fun or entertaining, but I felt it pulled me further away as the movie progressed without balancing the content as a product for everyone.I know, no one asked my opinion. I respect the movie, at least it aimed for a certain section of the audiences. The road trip was fine to me, except the music and the dance parts. Thankfully, there's no nudity, except once, but still an R rated movie for strong sexual appeal.Whatever the theme was about, I expected a good story. But it was a lot like a documentary. No focus on any particular characters, but Channing Tatum was in a prime position. No development either in the story other than a group that embark a road trip to participate in a competition. Nothing anything like the first film, kind of detached from afar.So I won't expect you to feel as the way I did on this, but you could consider my points and can judge whether want to watch it. Still, I'm not suggesting to boycott the film. I'm neutral, and all I'm saying is that it did not impress me, but it might you, especially if you are a woman.4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Awesome!,"Thanx for bringing a movie like this in different countries where these facilities are not easily available. At least women can enjoy a little bit through your movies. The strippers are shown in the light and positive light in the face of all their struggles. Its a good one. Keep it up. I just hope the goal of this story can be achieved someday all over the world. All the actors and actresses were brilliant. Yes, it can survive without Dallas. He's not all and all. It's very courageous of Channing Tatum to do a movie based on his life even after facing so many difficulties early in the life. You are actually healers who can bring a smile to someone.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Magic Mike 2000,"I really enjoyed the first Magic Mike movie. It made me feel like I understand what women want, made me learn interesting things and Channing Tatum was excellent, plus the film had an actual story, with character development. This version is just the pumped up, former celebrities filled, more diverse, less Miked road trip version of the film. It was quite a disappointment. Not even Amber Heard's beautiful presence could save it.The premise is that the band is splitting up and they want to go for one last ""stripper conference"". Matthew McConaughey is gone, Steven Soderbergh is gone, enter black people and beloved, yet tired (and less paid) celebrities like Jada Pinkett Smith, Andie MacDowell and Elizabeth Banks. The feeling that you understand the characters is gone, replaced by ""explanatory dialogues"" of why they are like healers and how they listen and understand. God damn it, every word I am writing in this review lowers my rating more and more. It is like a sequel constructed by studio lawyers with the help of focus groups made of mentally challenged people.The worst crime of this film, though, was that it wasn't about Magic Mike at all and had shitty choreography to boot. Channing Tatum's character joins the party as an outsider, while the focus is on everybody and everything else, while they are driving to the convention, meeting all kind of folks and giving occasional performances that seem like they are setting up the great one at the end of the movie. A performance which really sucked.Bottom line: I wonder if even women will like this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Darn Good Road Trip Film,Magic Mike XXL is a darn fine road trip movie. The cast is wonderful and have more opportunities to act in this film. Who'd a thunk it? We get to know the guys from the first film and we really care about them. Add to that we're viewing scads of beautifully sculptured male bodies throughout the film and its win win all the way around!All the bad reviews are so inaccurate and missing the point. This is a feel good movie about male strippers. Or maybe the reviewers are a little too close minded. MM XXL is big Fun with a capital F. A really laugh out loud type of film.The cinematography is beautiful. There are some gorgeous shots of Georgia. The soundtrack is good too. I really enjoyed all the main characters' final routines. The film creators really put some thought behind it and didn't just throw something at us just to make more money. For that I thank them.Well worth the money and the time.,10.0,Anonymous,Music

Road movie fusions with a dance contest movie,"If you have seen the first, you have to see what they do in the sequel, it is not the same thing, we are not in a strip club, this is kind of a road movie fusions with a dance contest movie, in this case a stripper convention of sorts :)The first film was better, this is missing some of the people from the first film, kind of like we couldn't get people on board so we make another kind of movie. This still have it's moments, but we are missing something, it has the strippers, it has a lot of funny scenes, most of the strange characters are back and new ones are added, but it doesn't quite get up there with the first one (even though that didn't get a high score either).Again as with the first one, see it for the dancing parts, see it for the romantic comedy it is, have fun and don't expect too much other then being entertained.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
An adequately exotic entertainment,"This film tells the story of a male exotic dance troupe making a comeback at the male strippers convention.""Magic Mike XXL"" is more talking and less dancing this time round, and I guess it's to do with the rising paycheck for the actors to rehearse the dance routines. Fortunately, it's still entertaining to watch, because this time the emphasis is not just exotic, but more on the sensualexperience of the ladies. It makes the ladies feel really special, especially at the membership club that Rome runs.The film is pretty non happening when it comes to exotic dancing, until the finale that is worth waiting for. The ending is far too abrupt though, and I heard people in the cinema let out sighs of disbelief that the film ends so suddenly. Overall, ""Magic Mike XXL"" is a fair entertainment for the evening. It's less interesting and less exotic than the first one, but it's still adequate.",,Anonymous,Music

Magic Mike XXL,"You guys have me laughing over these 1 star reviews!! What were you expecting?? Oscar worthy performances? Magic Mike is what it is and it does it VERY well. This movie had every person in the theater laughing and sitting with their mouths open most of the movie. I think the cast was very well chosen and the choreography on most of the dances is crazy good! Jada does a fantastic job as her role as Rome. I thought I would miss Matthew not being in the film but this one turned out better than the first. Now let's be clear... This is a naughty movie so try to not take your mother to see this unless you want an awkward experience! If you are a prude then this also is not the movie for you. I went with a small group of women but I actually recommend you taking your significant other and making him take notes! The music choices in the movie make you want to dance in your seat!

The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because of the few laughs I got from this worthless trashy joke of a film. Clearly this movie is geared to women and gay males. Honestly, this film didn't need any women at all, as all the males are clearly closeted gays. The whole film they admire each others semi nude bodies and are constantly dancing and striping for each other. Time they all got a room and got it over with. Magic Mike thinks he is Gene Kelley and he is not. I found the whole film a total turn off, the intended laughs unfunny, and the chemistry between the main characters lacking.

No More Magic: A Film Which Throws the Script Out the Window and Lacks Cast Dedication,"Magic Mike XXL, the sequel to the much-lauded Magic Mike is exactly what you were expecting the first film to be. When Magic Mike came out in 2012, many were surprised by how director Steven Soderbergh was able to humanize and bring tension and emotion to a story about male strippers. However, with Soderbergh not directing the second film, the story turned into an audience-pleasing film that prioritized abs over the script quality.Magic Mike XXL picks up with Mike (Channing Tatum) having finally started his own furniture building company (a dream he was working towards in the first film). The company is miniscule; so much that Mike has only one employee whom he can barely pay. But given the circumstances, Mike is happy, this was what he had always wanted. However, we see in brief flashes that Mike does miss doing his ""magic"" and dancing on ""the stage."" During a particularly impressive scene Channing Tatum dances to ""Pony"" in his wood shed, sliding and spinning around tools and planks erotically. Coincidently during a surprise reunion with his aging stripper ex-coworkers he is convinced to go to the Myrtle Beach stripper convention and dance with the boys one last time.The film's script is not worth analyzing, the director: Gregory Jacobs clearly wanted to focus more on physical comedy and dancing than anything else; unfortunately this makes the non-dancing scenes completely eternal and pointless. Regrettably, there are very few dancing scenes as well; besides the woodshed there is also a gas station dance that had everyone cracking up as Joe Manganiello's character tries to make a cashier smile on a bet, and then there is the stripper finale. There really is one good non-dancing scene which takes place at Andie MacDowel's character's house, but that's mainly because of the good acting from MacDowel (yes I was surprised she was in this film as well), Matt Bomer, Amber Heard, and Channing Tatum.The cast does seem extremely uncomfortable throughout the whole movie; even Channing Tatum wasn't really giving it his all, and it felt as though director Jacobs hadn't had a strict hand with his actors. Also many actors felt lost, I for one suffered as Matt Bomer struggled to make his character's actions seem rational and as he tried to dance. The only actor who was giving it full passion and felt like he was having the time of his life was Joe Manganiello, and it's unfortunate that his time to shine was in such a blunt movie. The cast had the female supporting additions of Jada Pinkett Smith, who was overused and a scene in her house dragged far too long, the surprising and afore mentioned Andie MacDowel (underused, but stealing the show when she was given the chance) and Amber Heard (had 2 minutes where she showed some spark).So in the end Magic Mike XXL ended up being what us cinema critics were hoping it wouldn't be. Disappointment? Yes. Entertainment? A little. Abs? A lot.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Wasn't what I was expecting,"I give this movie an 8 because you doesn't love watching Channing & the rest of the guys dance, but it wasn't what I expected. The first movie at least had a story line, a love story attached. It showed how people can bring themselves up from the bottom to the top no matter what their profession is and of course had the dancing involved to tie together a great show! This movie had a story line, but it wasn't nearly as good as the first one. Yes the dancing was great (when it actually happened) but there wasn't enough of the dancing for as much as it was bragged about. You sat through the entire movie to only get great dancing at the end in the last 5-10 minutes. I just expected a little bit more. Not asking for a full on porno by all means, but just stating that for the amount that it was bragged about for being so ""XL"" it wasn't anything over the top.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Not really for a male audience. 4/10,"Review: I knew what I was getting into when I rented this movie but I really didn't know that it was going to be so graphic. The way that Tatum was flipping those women over was quite athletic and the dance moves were definitely erotic, so I can understand why women will love this film but from a man's point of view, I really don't think that it was made for us. Don't get me wrong, they are very talented at what they do and the choreography is top form but there just wasn't enough elements to entertain the male market. Anyway, after building his own company and giving up the stripping business, Mike (Chaning Tatum) feels that there is a gap in his life and when he gets an invitation to meet up with his old pals that are still in the stripping business, he decides to join them on one last performance at Myrtle Beach were they hold a yearly stripper convention. His fellow strippers also want to call it a day after the convention, so there close friend gets a bus and they head off for there last showdown. On the way there, they meet up with a few old acquaintances and when there driver/MC crashes the bus, he ends up in hospital so they don't have an MC for the night. Mike then goes to an old friend, Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith), for her help and she hooks him up with some good contacts to help him. She also meets him at the convention and she decides to MC on the night and she helps them with some new moves so there final show will go down a storm with the ladies. When all the preparation is done and the King's of Tampa have there moves perfected, they enter the show with confidence and they give the ladies a night to remember. It really seemed like a road movie at the beginning of the film because Mike hadn't been with the group for three years so he has to clear up some bad blood for the road trip to go smoothly. Once all that is out of the way, it's straight down to business but the group never seem to be out of stripper mode, even when they are with people that they don't know. You don't get to see the characters individually so there isn't much depth to each of the dancers, except for Mike at the beginning. I did miss Dallas (Matthew McConaughey), who was excellent in the first movie but Chaning Tatum wasn't bad as the leading character. Anyway, it's a watchable movie which gives you an insight about the world of exotic dancing but from a man's point of view, it didn't do anything for me. Watchable!Round-Up: Chaning Tatum, 35, really did show off his dancing and physical expertise in this film and I must say, he did do a good job. After watching the terrible Jupiter Ascending he has definitely comeback with a bang with this movie and he has showed that he can cover any genre, after watching his brilliant performance in the Foxcatcher. With Gambit, 23 Jump Street, Guys and Dolls and Hail Caesar in the pipeline he is definitely making a name for himself in Hollywood. There are other cameos in this movie, like Jada Pinkett Smith, a horny Andie MacDowell and Elizabeth Banks but most of the screen time is on Tatum who has taken over from Dallas in the first movie. Anyway, the film was directed by Gregory Jacobs who also brought you Criminal and Wind Chill starring Emily Blunt. He also was an assistant director on the Ocean Eleven franchise and I did see that he stole the end fireworks scene at the end from them. I'll give him top marks for putting together a decent group of dancers who really did have talent but I honestly don't think that it was made for a male audience.Budget: $14.8million Worldwide Gross: $123millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their music/drama/comedies starring Channing Tatum, Juan Piedrahita, Josh Diogo, Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Adam Rodriguez, Jada Pinkett Smith, Elizabeth Banks and Andie MacDowell. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Strong dancers. Weak plot. Boring.,"Wow. This was one TEDIOUS eye-roller of a movie. The plot is practically non-existent, and seemed thinly borrowed from 'Priscilla Queen of the Dessert.' It merely serves to string together a series of vignettes of dudes bonding, working out their angst, and showing off. The false emotion is as thick as dripping wax. The audience is treated to one silly scenario after another. But all of them are ridiculous.The gratuitous use of curse words, particularly the F*bomb, got REALLY old after the first 10 minutes of the film.Obviously, it wasn't meant to be serious, judging from the adventures the boys encounter along their way to a stripper convention. None of it bore a resemblance to reality. Clearly, it was not meant to.I'd have given this one star, but Channing Tatum was worth another star as eye-candy.If you're looking for utterly mindless entertainment, you might find it in this film - though the ""entertainment"" value is questionable. Maybe ""mindless"" is be the key word.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

An utterly pointless continution,"This was a massive downgrade compared to the first film.

"Story, and Sexy","The film is directed by Gregory Jacobs and co-produced by Steven Soderbergh, and is about as close to a non-movie as a movie can be while still calling itself a movie. It follows the Kings of Tampa, Ken (Matt Bomer), Big Dick Richie (Joe Manganiello), Tarzan (Kevin Nash), Tito (Adam Rodriguez), and Mike (Channing Tatum) as they drive to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina to compete at a strippers' convention. ""We got a tsunami of dollar bills to get to, daddy,"" exclaims Mike in a tone that makes it sound as though they're about to storm the beach at Normandy. ""Magic Mike XXL"" is a picaresque narrative, or perhaps a comic epic. Mike is the captain of the S. S. Bananahammock, trying to lead his crew of gyrators and lady-pleasurers toward one last big, long, wide hurrah before they go their separate ways and join the ""respectable"" world. En route to Myrtle Beach, Mike and company go places and meet people and have (often comically) erotic adventures. These set pieces feel geographically self-contained, as if every nightclub or private home were sequestered on its own island. They stop by a gay strip club and compete onstage, then unwind at an all-night beach party. They also stop by a next-generation strip club run by Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith), who styles herself as a goddess-queen of desire. ""XXL"" is a sequel to the first ""Mike"" that brings the routines into the wider world, creating a contrast between a low-budget, semi-realistic road picture and an old-fashioned musical. There are solos set in Mike's workshop and at a gas station convenience store, and a couple numbers that are more song than dance. The final act of the film, set at the stripper convention, is a self-contained concert film that gives all of the guys their own solo numbers. Smith presides over this section of the film as if auditioning to play the Emcee in the next Broadway production of ""Cabaret."" Soderbergh's camera glide up and down on cranes as if we were watching Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse rather than jockstrapped hunks grinding and diving and flipping and dry-humping. Magic Mike XXL is a film marketed at the hen-night demographic, with Andie MacDowell's character lusting after the heroes. The characters are rethinking male burlesque, but with less plot, less character, less interest and no Matthew McConaughey. They have also junked the do-I-really-wanna-be-a-male-stripper angst which gave the first film depth, or at any rate some dramatic interest. Mike Lane, played by Tatum, is back, quietly getting on with his post-stripping career of creating chairs and dressers, but when his erstwhile buddies slide back into town in a slather of babyoil, he decides he's bored with the world of carp.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Simply not good..,"The movie starts off good, but as we move forward unmeaningful scenes come up that ruin the little moments that were actually good and entertaining. The dancing is amazing there is not question about that, but the movie has no objective or meaning or message or anything which tells me that the movie is only made for means of money and nothing else. I think the only people who should watch this movie is the people who want to be professional strippers and don't know the professional moves to become one. Even the die hard Tatum fans or woman who want to see some nice muscular bodies of male strippers should not watch this movie because Tatum does not put up a great performance other than the dancing and we don't see a lot of strip dancing anyways. The point is this movie is not fun at all and does not entertain you unless you want it to. In my opinion a waste of time an unwatchable.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Sold itself out from the first one. Cash grab for the fans. Unfortunately boring too. Very disappointing,"Magic Mike was an interesting and enjoyable film which explored important themes about a young man struggling to make the right decisions in life. Mike appeared to be evolving at the end of the first film. And then somehow in this, he forgets about all of that and just runs back and joins all the old gang for a seemingly pressureless romp with the lads. It makes no sense. It was clearly some kind of cash grab to capitalise on the fanbase. But it completely sold itself out. This may be partly forgivable if the film was actually fun and any good.

I didn't even get the first half hour, because it was just really vague, and i kept thinking 'what is the point in this?'.The dancing was OK, but very similar to the first, there was nothing really different. The only positives i can give from this film is that the music was better than the first, and this helped, because for a time of 30 seconds ish every so often i felt there was a reason for watching this film!

Everyone needs some Magic Mike in their life,"Now here comes a film whose only intentions are to entertain and make people smile, and it's the purity of these intentions that makes this film such a knockout. In fact, Magic Mike XXL is so infectiously positive, only the heartless, prudish, and close-minded will be left without a smile. How refreshing it is to see a film that doesn't judge or criticize its audience and celebrates sexuality as something that one shouldn't be ashamed of. On top of that, the film makes a point about treating everyone equally and with respect, regardless of race, sex, sexuality, and size. In that regard, the film is revolutionary. For example, Jada Pinkett Smith plays a character who refers to women as ""queens"" and men as ""kings."" Additionally, the climax features a dance number where Channing Tatum and Stephen Boss (aka: Twitch) mirror dance moves to their respective attendees, despite their difference in skin color. Our male comrades also find themselves vogueing in a drag show. A DRAG SHOW. If you were wondering why gay people weren't included in the first film, well, they fixed it here. Also, I had no idea what vogueing meant, but I do now.But let's not get bogged down in the subtext. Magic Mike XXL is completely different from the first film, yet it's almost as good as it, with terrific performances from everyone. The side characters from the first film are fleshed out here, with each member of the Kings of Tampa getting their chance to shine. Apart from Tatum, the most notable of the bunch is Joe Manganiello, who appears in a dance routine involving Backstreet Boys' ""I Want It That Way."" ...as you can imagine, it's one of the best scenes in the film. Oh, and you get to hear Matt Bomer sing...twice. There are also a few new castmembers, including the aforementioned Jada Pinkett Smith. She steals every single scene she's in as Rome, the feisty and commanding ringleader of her own club, as well as a past lover of Mike. On top of that, Donald Glover, Andie MacDowell, and Elizabeth Banks are very memorable in their limited roles. Literally everyone is good in it. By the time the credits rolled, I exhaled deeply with a stupid grin on my face, having gone through a joyous experience. Sure, Magic Mike XXL doesn't have that much to offer in terms of plot or stakes, but it is the most unabashedly entertaining movie of the year so far. Whether you're male or female, gay or straight, you'd be hard-pressed to find a more feel-good movie this summer.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A Fun Movie - doesn't deserve all the bad reviews,"I checked IMDb before watching this movie and I expected it to be really bad. But it was actually funny and I really liked it. Obviously, people who go to see it don't expect an intellectual movie or a superb plot. So for what it is, it was pretty awesome. The dance routines were fun and it had some good humor. I didn't regret spending 1h 50min watching it. I went for a fun movie and that's exactly what I got. It's a candy for the eyes. The guys looked great. I enjoyed it.The whole theater was bursting into laughter. I don't know why a guy would want to see it but there were a couple of guys there (to my amusement). I thought most of the scenes were done with taste. And they made Magic Mike look ridiculously hot. I haven't seen the first movie so I don't have anything to compare it to.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Back with some more magic.,"In the 2012 blockbuster, Magic Mike, In which Channing Tatum was cemented as an actor and put into the hearts of wild young ladies. But, since the director of the first film, Steven Sodenbergh is gone (although he is the director of photography), can the new director, Gregory Jacobs make some (good) magic again? Well, boy you better buckle up your seatbelt, because XXL is a hell of a ride! First of all, the flashy music and flashy camera takes help the gloomy atmosphere shine. Some of the cast members return, but it was sad to see Matthew McConaughey go away, and The Kid doesn't make a return. But Jada Pinkett Smith neatly fills Dallas' shoes (and adds heels to them). The music is the star here, be sure to catch the film in theaters, because the sound is bang on with bass loud and clear in your face, it is probably better than the sounds in Pitch Perfect 2. And that's saying something. Jacobs slowly crafts Magic Mike into a saga, a legacy, something more than a soft core male stripping porn movie. XXL is a hell of a good time, it's not awkward (for me and the men) and regardless of your gender, enjoy this incredibly fun movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Beyond better than the first.,"In my opinion, this movie was amazing, especially compared to the first one. I love Jada Pinkett in this movie. The music, dancing, cast, and plot was amazing. I don't regret paying money to see it. Not only was it sexy it was comedic as well. It went above and beyond what my standards of this movie originally was. This movie didn't just focus on one character (Magic Mike) but it let the others get recognition and allowed their personalities to be known. Every part of the movie (to me) was intriguing. Don't get me wrong I liked the first movie but hands down Magic Mike XXL is BEYOND better. I'm stating that based on plot, cast, stunts/performance, script, and soundtrack. 10/10 for sure.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Way better than 6.2!,"IMDb raters really panned this. I thought the story was hilarious. The convenience store scene alone put this movie over the top. Now, maybe the average male thought this one crap, what average hetero woman actually likes the storyline and content of male risqué theater? Zero? I give this one an eight. Women don't have enough fun... And freedom... In this area.All of the main characters probably worked their brains out to condition for this, and learn the challenging choreography.

Surprised at the negative reviews,"I thought this movie was great. I mean you have to remember to take it for what it is a break from reality. This film focuses on the bond between the ""colleagues"" not really sure what to call them but it focuses on the problems within their friendships and more on their back stories. I feel the movie does fine without Matthew McConaughey, and benefits from the removal of the characters ""The Kid"" and Brooke. I enjoyed the addition of Zoe and her friends. I found that Jada Pinkett's scenes added nothing to the movie left me feeling that her character was pointless. I laughed so hard I'm talking tears streaming stomach cramping laughter for a good portion of the movie it was very enjoyable. I actually prefer the sequel to the original. I feel part of what makes this movie so good is that unlike The Hangover 2 they strayed away from the original plot.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Very Entertaining,"The first one had some cool dance routines. But then there was the excruciatingly boring and dud ""girlfriend""... I mean, when you looked her... in a strip movie - that's supposed to be filled with attractive, beautiful, lively girls & women. I went like wha...????!At least part two entertaining - to the end. And I mean from start to finish. So glad that absolutely boring girl has been scrapped; she really did the first one a disservice. She radiated ...boredom. Lifelessness.Anyway, In this one, we have Amber Heard. Yes, she's skinny as hell; but at least she is nice to look at. She radiates something interesting. Much better choice.The movie? Heh, it's not an Oscar winner, but it sure was fun to watch. Really, I've been a stripper myself; and got nice flashbacks - all throughout, especially the shows they were doing at the stripper convention. Obviously, all the guys had a great time and every girl I spoke to thought the movie ended a bit quick. But none of them had anything bad to say about it. The theater was filled with mostly girls & women anyway. I counted a couple of gay guys and the odd guy with his girlfriend/wife; even they enjoyed it.Don't be a macho dick. Go see the movie. Have some fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Condiments! What An Awful Idea!,"This film was a lot better than the prequel, in my opinion!So the film starts off following Magic Mike (Tatum) as he tries to lead a normal life...then he gets a call explaining one of his former dance colleagues has passed away. As he attends the so called 'wake', he realizes it is a lie, and that his friends just wanted to lure him to meet up with them. Why? One final show, together!From then on, its just non-stop dancing and flirting! OK, so I'm a guy, and I'll admit it is a film geared towards girls. With a film like this, I did not go in expecting a convincing story line & to be frank, there wasn't really one present. Other downers include a pretty poor ending, and in my opinion Kevin Nash's character was just useless & looked misplaced!But why did I rate it so highly then? Firstly, Tatum is such an excellent dancer it is unreal! It takes real talent to be able to pull of such dance moves. The choice of music was pretty excellent too, and his co-stars were pretty decent dancers too! Finally, there was quite a fair bit of comedy present!So in conclusion, I can see why guys would hate this film, however, the dance sequences are great & let's be honest, many guys would trade quite a bit to be able to dance like these guys!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"entertaining dialog and some dances, but... story? character development?","Magic Mike XXL in a way is like the films that Adam Sandler has been making with his buddies over the past several years (think the Grown Ups movies, Blended, even Jack & Jill), where, and Sandler's admitted this, it's really an excuse to hang out with his buddies while going on basically a paid vacation. The difference in this case of a Magic Mike sequel is that there IS some actual craft going on, with an artist like Steven Soderbergh behind the lens and in the cutting room. While he is not credited as director - this is currently during his hiatus as a full-on helmer (I hasten to say retirement) - his fingerprints are still all over Gregory Jacobs' first stab at making a Hollywood feature.The camera and editing can get experimental here, which is good and intriguing; one might not expect things like low, natural light (see the Tatum/Amber Heard meeting scene on the beach at night), but it is here in a Magic Mike sequel and that is appreciated, as is the use of light and how Soderbergh cuts his dance numbers together. They don't move ever TOO fast or kinetically, and he uses cranes and other motions really well. Considering that this is, in a manner of speaking, an action movie, the action is presented reasonably well.The problem then? In lieu of the character Dallas being written off (i.e. McConaughey couldn't get brought on back post-Oscar, I suspect), Tatum's titular character rejoins for the One Last Time scenario, and goes with his 'Male Entertainer' buddies on a road trip. So, first off, no McConaughey, so what can be made up for it? Jada Pinkett Smith in a sexy but thankless role as a would-be MC, and Donald Glover basically doing his, uh, Donald Glover/Childish Gambino thing, and though somewhat putting on the stripper-thing is really not that physique. The other thing is more crucial: there's no story. Or really much character development. Like, at all.Oh, sure, things happen, and Mike has his moments with each character (oh, look, his phone to do all his work stuff is thrown out the window, as are all the uh, wait, all the old costumes, won't they need some of those, whatever). And there are some funny set pieces; the one that takes the cake for me involves the character played by Joe Manganiello in a convenience store where he does an over-the-top dance to a Backstreet Boys song to just get the cashier to smile. However, all of the hijinks can't mask how little there really is here - and how stretched it becomes at a near two-hour running time. It feels its weight and length especially in the mid-section, mainly in over-long scenes at a Male-Stripper party at night and a chance meeting with Andie McDowell's character (albeit she is one of the better actors here in her all too brief and kind of on its own intriguing scene).Ironic that Tatum gets a sorta, kinda, half-assed love interest here played by Amber Heard, and though less developed than the romantic angle in the previous film she carries more charisma and talent than Mike's flame in the first film (also written off for the sequel). She is practically shoe-horned in to whatever thin narrative is here, and yet among the characters she does stand out in her naturalistic way (at least as much as the script allows, which... is quite a bit actually). So there's a lot of male bonding here, some fine dialog that allows for funny jabs and even small, if minute, moments of insight... but ultimately, it lacks what a movie NEEDS to actually get one invested.It may have more dancing than the first movie - I didn't put a stop-watch to time it out, but it felt like bigger numbers, certainly with this movie's climax which lasts a good twenty minutes, albeit meant to be a showstopper and it tries hard - but Soderbergh's presence as someone who could corral the story and characters together into something more interesting is lacking. Kudos to him sticking around to make the look consistent and compelling though, if he didn't do more for Jacobs.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Well done gentlemen,"If only there were an Oscar for hotness. Kudos to channing, joe, matt, adam and kevin (not to forget Michael strahan, dashuan and crew). Respect to the actors for working out so hard to achieve such perfect bodies! Joe and Channing were standout dancers. Straight up talent. Matt Bomer surprised with an incredible singing voice. It is amazing fun to watch these performances. The female characters were kind of duds. Could do without psychoanalyzing the one dimensional women (got a bit embarrassing at points esp the scene with Andie mcdowell and her wino middle aged desperate lady friends-gay husband, crying b/c i don't feel attractive ugh stereotype much). Guess what, women just enjoy the show, not because they have low self esteem or need someone to make them feel beautiful. It's just fun to watch hot guys dance!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
In some way better than the original,"Takes place three years after the first. Mike (Channing Tatum) is out of the stripping business and owns his own (failing) company. He gets a call from his ex stripper buddies. They're going to a stripper convention and want him to join them for one last time. They go on a road trip to get there and, along the way, encounter many interesting women such as Zoe (Amber Heard), a former girlfriend of Mikes named Rome (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Nancy (Andie MacDowell).The original didn't need a sequel but who cares? We get to see a cast of attractive guys in GREAT shape stripping. The original seemed to go out of its way to NOT objectify the guys as sex objects. Not here! The camera gets up close and comfortable showing how pumped and attractive these guys are. Also the other strippers (Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer and Adam Rodriguez) barely had more than a few words in the original. Here they have fully fleshed out stories and characters. The acting is great (Smith especially was wonderful), the script sharp and the strip acts were incredible. The prime audience for this is women and gay men. As a gay guy I loved it!

Pure escapism bathed in Southern sunshine,"Okay, it's official: this is my feel-good movie of 2015. Nothing's going to top it. It's funny, clever, and surprisingly subversive. And as for that boy - you know, the one who can dance - he's finally got old enough to begin to be interesting. And, dear lord, he can still dance!Magic Mike XXL is an altogether lighter, frothier confection than its predecessor. There's not much room here for serious plot structure – it's pure escapism bathed in Southern sunshine and marinated in a cocktail of pecs, biceps and spray-on tan. All the remaining characters from the original film get a bit more character development, but it's not overdone; watching this film is far from being an intellectual exercise.The film is full of parody, and sends itself up as much as the other films it references. Mike's familiar ineffectual bumbling, here ramped up to an almost irritating degree, masks an incisive mind that is at work manipulating the rest of his crew until at the final moment they are all exactly where he wants them to be. This is where Channing Tatum shines: in a darker character, these machinations would be sinister or chilling, but he only wants what's best for everybody – and in a film as light and sweet as candy floss everyone can get what they deserve, even if it's only for five minutes under the spotlights in a rowdy club.There were a couple of reluctant boyfriends amongst the overwhelmingly female audience at the cinema, and they both belly-laughed within the first few minutes. It's good. Don't take my word for it. You deserve to have the same goofy grin on your face - pure pleasure.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Moves with the fluidity of water-based lubricant and charms like a serenading male stripper,"Upon release, I called the original ""Magic Mike"" ""a film of depth and certainty"" and still hold it in high regard to this day, an opinion I'm frequently prodded for having. The fact of the matter was ""Magic Mike"" was a film that was enjoyable as a piece of fluff that showed off the talent and athleticism of its leading male performers and also found a great deal of success as a drama about gritty business and toxic relationships in a fairly seamy field.""Magic Mike XXL"" is in the perfect position as a sequel to degrade its predecessor by pulling a ""gotcha"" at the audience, discarding all of its thoughtfulness in exchange for overdoing everything it did with such nuance in the first film. It could've been an endurance test of the highest degree, soaking everything in testosterone and surface-level dance numbers that would, in turn, add nothing to these characters and their personalities.Thankfully, writer Reid Carolin and director Gregory Jacobs take over the roles from the master Steven Soderbergh to deliver a film that does everything its predecessor does in a manner that relatively mirrors it but not to a fault. A sequel like this operates on a field of landmines, with the possibility of veering into all glitz and tiresome dance numbers at every turn, but Carolin and Jacobs remind us why the original film captivated us so much by giving us a film about human pleasure and the desire to arouse and excite.We refocus on our titular character (reprised by Channing Tatum), who is now the CEO of his own company and is making a living away from dancing. When he is contacted by Tarzan (Kevin Nash), who lies and says that their old friend and coworker Dallas (Matthew McConaughey in the original film) has died, Mike rushes to find that Dallas went to perform overseas and the guys lied to him simply so they could see him again.Upon listening his old friends and dancers such as Ken (Matt Bomer), ""Big Dick Richie"" (Joe Manganiello), Tito (Adam Rodriguez), and their new friend Tobias (Gabriel Iglesias in a role that, despite the unlikely, rather fits him) tell stories, Mike finds the spark for dancing rekindled. He decides to drop everything and head down to Myrtle Beach with his buddies for one last dance to prove multiple different things. For one, Mike wants to prove that he still has what it takes to be a talented dancer but the other is something greater, something all the guys quietly want to prove.Mike and the gang want to prove that they still have what it takes to make a woman happy, joyful, and filled with the kind of excitement that she desires when venturing out to a strip club with her female friends on a Friday or Saturday night. Consider the scene when the boys are high off Ecstasy and dare Richie to waltz into a gas station and make the unhappy older woman behind the counter smile with a dance routine to the Backstreet Boys. The scene is uproariously funny and one of the most positive scenes I have yet to see this year, but it also works to prove to these men that they can still give a woman the fun she wanted.More of this insecurity sets in during a large bachelorette party that has Andre (Donald Glover), an R&B/rap singer and professional dancer, at the helm. Andre is a younger, ostensibly more energetic presence than the former ""Kings of Tampa"" and his ability to dance flawlessly and make up an impromptu song for the women he serenades puts him clearly at the top of his game. Mike and his friends, who watch Andre put on his show, attempt to change up their routine before they hit Myrtle Beach, to show the town that they can still do what those half their age can and do it better.Soderbergh's directorial flare kicked in with ""Magic Mike"" during the spacious dance scenes, which showed the entire stage as a playground for Soderbergh's tricks, with lighting, decorations, and choreography being placed at the forefront during as well. While Jacobs has less of an opportunity to showcase the large-scale stage dances, he makes up for it in the multitude of different ways he finds to shoot bodies bouncing off of one another. ""Magic Mike XXL"" has so many scenes including people of both sexes being lifted up, landing face first in crotches, sliding off of one another, and working off different bodies that it almost becomes an action film. Jacobs captures these scenes with intense clarity and focus, living up to the Soderbergh-style of direction I anticipated watching this film.Ultimately, however, the sincerity behind the emotion in ""Magic Mike XXL"" carries it places. Long scenes that take place in one setting, whether they are in a gas station or a luxurious home sipping rare and expensive wine with older (and younger) women, Carolin understands that this particular film can lack a ""point A/point B"" plot and still be a worthwhile experience. The plotlessness of ""Magic Mike XXL"" allows for conversations and real human connection to take place in a way that's remarkably beautiful, and I'll be damned if this doesn't end up being one of my favorite films of the year in terms of showcasing the human spirit in its most tender forms.NOTE: ""Magic Mike XXL"" is also one of the few films that could end with the song ""All I Do is Win"" by DJ Khaled and have it be totally fitting and not have it be pompous or flashy at all. This entire franchise has been a cinematic mystery waiting to be defined.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A lot better than I expected,"Magic Mike XXL was actually a pretty darn good film. The film is directed beautifully! I mean really Magic Mike XXL is just directed beautifully and it's filmed wonderfully. And the acting by all the cast is just great I was so pleased with the acting in this movie. Jada Pinkett Smith blew me away, I thought she did a fantastic job here! Also Matt bomber Channing Tatum Joe and Amber heard all did a great job! You could really tell that everyone was just so passionate about this movie and really cared a lot when they were making it! Now as for the choreography and the stripping and the hot dancing, they freaking nailed it! The stripper sequences were so sexy and well choreographed! But this movie is more than what you think it is, it's not just about hot men. There are some very heartfelt moments with great acting, and I was pleased that it was actually a quality film and not just a porno. Andie McDowell was great, she fit her role so perfectly! She was spot on with the lines and sexy mature dialogue! God her part was just so well written! And like I said before, the writing is well written and very dramatic. I absolutely loved the great chemistry between all the characters! I mean all cast members were so close and had really awesome relationships. And then of course it's freaking awesome to see the hot thongs and Joe's chiseled abs, oh my dear Jesus!

What a surprise,"I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised by the movie. Of course it's not anything ground-breaking, but it's good for what it is. It took me a little to get into it, but when the dancing started I got hooked. In my opinion the movie was way better than the first one. It's a fun one and not trying to be anything more than it is. On the other hand, it's surprisingly diverse (female and male characters, POCs). Usually movies like this are full of problematic lines/characters, but with this one I can't think of a single thing.

A great movie.,"This is a great movie. Channing Tatum and Jada Pickett Smith should win Academy Awards for their performances, which were electrifying. The story has an intensity that draws the audience into the action. The guys are not clowns, they are highly talented and intensely dedicated artists who specialize in a form of choreography that few can perform, even poorly. The story has a serious and upbeat theme - that one must be true to himself. These guys are not merely exhibitionists; they are artists who practice a form of choreography that requires a high level of skill and training. Their art has a universal message - that you are beautiful and special. What an upbeat message! Pinkett Smith's performance as the emcee is incomparable. Tatum's performance in the title role once again proves that he is one of the premier actors in cinema today. The rest the cast is wonderful. Kevin Nash gives a performance that is subdued and powerful. Each character has a story and each story adds to the strength of the plot which makes this movie great.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Other than that I loved this movie from beginning to end except the chocolate up the leg on the one act. I loved that the whole movie was interesting not just parts of it.

Male stripping seems like it would be an awesome job!,"'MAGIC MIKE XXL': Four Stars (Out of Five)Sequel to the 2012 hit stripper flick 'MAGIC MIKE'. This one has the star, Channing Tatum, reprising the title role (one of his most popular parts); but the original's director, Steven Soderbergh, is only serving as an executive producer this time around. Gregory Jacobs, who was the first assistant director on the original movie, directs this sequel. Reid Carolin did return to write the script, but Matthew McConaughey didn't return to reprise his popular costarring role (due to money restrictions); Alex Pettyfer and Cody Horn are also absent. Actors Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer, Kevin Nash and Adam Rodriguez did happily reprise their parts. They're joined by newcomers Amber Heard, Jada Pinkett Smith, Elizabeth Banks, Andie MacDowell, Gabriel Iglesias, Michael Strahan and Donald Glover. I don't think it's quite as memorable a film, or as well made, as the original, but it's close.The story (if you can call it that) begins three years after the events of the original. Mike (Tatum) was recently dumped by his girlfriend (Horn, in the original), who he had planned to marry, and his business is struggling. It turns out that Mike's old stripper boss, Dallas (McConaughey, in the original), abandoned his old stripper team and started a new touring show, with Mike's old protégé, Adam (Pettyfer, in the original). So Mike's old buddies call on him, to join them for one last big performance. Mike reluctantly agrees and a chaotic road trip adventure begins (fueled by stripping, drugs and sex with older women).The movie is definitely not as magical as the original, especially without Soderbergh at the helm (and minus Matthew McConaughey), but it's still a lot of fun. Male stripping seems like it would be an awesome job, if you're good at it, and these films do a great job glamorizing it. These movies also have some amazing dance moves (especially by Tatum), some good laughs and some nice male bonding (especially in this sequel). Jacobs does a more than adequate job, trying to fill his old mentor's shoes, and the cast is fantastic. It's not quite as memorable, or as classic, as the original, but it's pretty damn close.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/ke2k3oL5gSI",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Could Use a Little More Magic,"Compared to the first MM, Magic Mike XXL is less a morality tale and more of a roadtrip romp. I liked the first film a bit more, but have no doubt I'll be in the minority on that. The first film's Soderberghiness gave the story a bit more gravitas, which is missing from XXL. It was still a lotta fun.Disappointed that Chatum had the lights down on his six-pack through the film. In his recent Reddit AMA, he said his fave sandwich was pb&j with Cheetos inside -- Little cause and effect there. The dancing wasn't as effective in XXL; overall, I'd say the film is missing the 'female gaze'.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Movie is exactly what you'd expect it to be,"I'm a straight guy. I wanted some mindless entertainment and I got it.

I clicked 3 random reviews and saw ""Cleopatra James(1973) - I saw this film the weekend it came out in 1973 downtown Baltimore"" and more along the lines of ""I remember seeing this movie when I was 15 years old"". If you find yourself in this demographic the movie's not targeted at you.Basically... what I'm trying to say is that the movie is exactly what you'd expect it to be, you watched the trailer, you read the synopsis, that's what you're gonna get.
